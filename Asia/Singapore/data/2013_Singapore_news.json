The medical student, who died last weekend of injuries sustained in the hour-long assault in a moving bus in Delhi, was cremated on Sunday in the Indian capital, close to where she had lived with her family. Her identity has still not been made public. The case has triggered outrage, grief and anger, with protests across India continuing on Tuesday. It has also provoked an unprecedented debate about sexual aggression towards women in the country. Six men, including one who claims to be a juvenile aged 17, have been detained and are accused of her rape and murder. Police have drawn up a 1,000-page charge sheet which they will present in court on Thursday. Hundreds of people joined the family by the banks of the Ganges \u2013 a sacred river, according to Hindu belief \u2013 at the village of Bharauli, 600 miles east of Delhi. According to the Times of India newspaper, the funeral cortege took three hours to cover the five miles to the river from their ancestral home because of the crowds. India&apos;s often ruthless and sensationalistic media had agreed to stay away. The suspects in the case could face the death penalty if convicted. Police in Delhi say &quot;a bone test&quot; will be used to establish the exact age of the man who claims to be 17. A juvenile cannot be prosecuted for murder in India. The rape took place on 16 December and the victim, a physiotherapy student, died last week in a Singapore hospital where she had been sent for emergency treatment after 10 days in a local hospital. Her family have said they would like to see her attackers hanged. Four of the suspects were living in a slum neighbourhood in Delhi. Neighbours and relatives told the Guardian that they too would like to see the death penalty imposed if the men were found guilty. Protesters and politicians have called for a special session of parliament to pass new laws to increase punishments for rapists \u2013 including possible chemical castration \u2013 and to set up fast-track courts to deal with rape cases within 90 days. Thousands of Indians have lit candles, held prayer meetings and marched through various cities and towns to express their grief and demand stronger protection for women and the death penalty for rape, which is currrently punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. On Monday, the Indian army and navy cancelled their new year celebrations, as did Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party. Several hotels and clubs across the capital also did not hold their usual parties. Women face daily harassment across India, including catcalls on the streets and groping and touching on public transport. Indian media are currently reporting incidents of sexual violence that would rarely have gained attention previously. One incident involved a teenager, raped repeatedly by her brother, who fled only to be assaulted on a bus by a conductor. Others involved a 15-year-old held for 15 days by three men in a village in the Sultanpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a poverty-stricken northern state, an 11-year-old allegedly raped by three teenagers in the north-eastern city of Guwahati and two cases of rape in the city of Amritsar."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/01/indian-bus-rape-delhi-rush-guns", "sentences": ["The ashes of the victim of the attack \u2013 who died on Friday after 13 days in hospitals in India and Singapore, and was cremated in Delhi in a secret ceremony under heavy security on Sunday \u2013 were scattered on the surface of the Ganges river, sacred to Hindus, in northern India on Tuesday."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T15:39:52Z", "title": "Indian bus rape: Delhi sees rush for guns", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "Society", "Women", "Life and style"], "article": "Hundreds of women in Delhi have applied for gun licences following the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman by six men in a bus in the city last month. The news underlines the widespread sense of insecurity in the city, deep before the incident and deeper now, and the lack of faith in law enforcement agencies. The ashes of the victim of the attack \u2013 who died on Friday after 13 days in hospitals in India and Singapore, and was cremated in Delhi in a secret ceremony under heavy security on Sunday \u2013 were scattered on the surface of the Ganges river, sacred to Hindus, in northern India on Tuesday. The case has provoked an unprecedented debate about endemic sexual harassment and violence in India. Tens of thousands have protested across the country, calling for harsher laws, better policing and a change in culture. Politicians, initially caught off-guard, have now promised new legislation to bring in fast-track courts and harsher punishments for sexual assault. The six men accused of the attack are to be formally charged with murder later this week and potentially face execution. Indian media are currently reporting incidents of sexual violence that would rarely gain attention previously. In the last 24 hours these have included a teenager fleeing repeated abuse by her brother, who was allegedly assaulted on a bus by a conductor, a 15-year-old held for 15 days by three men in a village in Uttar Pradesh and repeatedly assaulted, an 11-year-old allegedly raped by three teenagers in the north-eastern city of Guwahati and two cases of rape in the city of Amritsar. One case reported on Tuesday involved a woman, also in a village in Uttar Pradesh, who suffered 90% burns after being doused in kerosene, allegedly by a man who had been stalking her for months. There were signs that a further taboo was about to be broken when one of India&apos;s best-known English-language television presenters asked viewers who had experienced abuse from a family member to contact her. The rush for firearms will cause concern, however. Police in Delhi have received 274 requests for licences and 1,200 inquiries from women since 18 December, two days after the woman and a male friend were attacked in a bus cruising on busy roads between 9pm and 10pm. &quot;Lots of women have been contacting us asking for information about how to obtain licences. Any woman has a threat against her. It&apos;s not surprising. There are fearless predators out there,&quot; said Abhijeet Singh of the campaign group Guns For India. Delhi police received around 500 applications for the whole of 2011, up from 320 the previous year. Hundreds of women had come in person to the police licensing department in the city, the Times of India reported. &quot;We had to patiently tell them that one needs to have a clear danger to one&apos;s life to be given a licence. However some \u2026 said that with even public transport no longer safe in the city they just cannot take chances,&quot; an unnamed official told the newspaper. There are estimated to be 40m guns in India, the second highest number in the world after the US. Licences are hard to obtain and most are illegal weapons, many manufactured in backstreet workshops. Official ownership levels remain low \u2013 three guns for every 100 people \u2013 but in recent years the number of women holding arms has risen. Most are wealthy and worried about theft or assault. There are fears the attack will lead to further restrictions on women in India, who already suffer significant constraints. Elders in Matapa, in the poverty-stricken Indian state of Bihar, banned the use of mobile phones for teenage girls and warned them against wearing &quot;sexy&quot; clothes. They claim the move will check rape cases and restore &quot;social order&quot;. Other villages nearby are planning similar bans, locals said. One member of parliament in Rajasthan, the north-western state, also called for a ban on skirts for schoolgirls to keep them away from &quot;men&apos;s lustful gazes&quot;. Banwari Lal Singhal said private schools allowing students to wear skirts explained increased sexual harassment locally. Matapa is in southern Bihar&apos;s Aurangabad district \u2013 the region from which one of the Delhi gang-rape accused, Akshay Thakur, comes. The order was issued after a formal meeting with villagers, council officials and school teachers on Sunday. &quot;Almost every villager pressed us to ban the mobile phones use by the schoolgirls saying they are proving quite dangerous for the society and corrupting traditional values,&quot; the local village council head, Sushma Singh, told the Guardian on Tuesday. Protesters were angered by the news. &quot;Our sister will have died in vain if all that is happening after is our fear is greater and ladies are more unfree,&quot; said Deepti Anand, a 21-year-old student in Delhi who has attended demonstrations most days in recent weeks.

The suggestion that the 23-year-old physiotherapy student be named \u2013 made by Shashi Tharoor, a junior government minister \u2013 has found support among many of those who have been campaigning over the last three weeks for tougher police action against those accused of sexual assault and a change in Indian society&apos;s views on women. &quot;It would mean her memory would live on,&quot; said Sangeeta Kumar, a 31-year-old teacher who has been protesting in Delhi. Others said the move, which goes against a supreme court order prohibiting naming a rape victim, placed symbolism above substance. &quot;It is an unnecessary distraction. We should be focussing on important issues such as sentencing, the economic rehabilitation of families who suffer and so on. We did not protect her dignity and life when she was alive. Who knows if she would have wanted such a thing. It&apos;s an absolute no-no,&quot; said Ranjana Kumari, director of the Centre for Social Research and a member of India&apos;s National Commission for Empowerment of Women. Indian media reported the victim&apos;s family saying they would be honoured if a package of new legislation was named after her. Conservative cultural attitudes in India mean rape victims are often stigmatised. Some, particularly in rural communities, are forced to marry their attackers to gain social acceptance. &quot;It&apos;s not easy to survive social shame in India,&quot; Kumari told the Guardian. After misjudging popular sentiment in the immediate aftermath of the incident, the Indian government has acted to head off public anger. A fast-track court was inaugurated in the capital Delhi on Wednesday, as the first of five that will be set up to deal rapidly with rape cases. The six accused in the gang-rape case will be formally charged on Thursday but are not expected to appear in court. India suffers from a lack of judges and cases frequently take years to come to trial. The country&apos;s supreme court will decide on Thursday on a proposal to suspend Indian lawmakers from office when facing sexual assault charges against women. Six state-level parliamentarians are facing rape prosecutions and two national parliamentarians are facing other charges of crimes against women, said Jagdeep S Chhokar, from the Association for Democratic Reforms, an independent thinktank that tracks political candidate&apos;s criminal records. In the past five years, political parties across India nominated 260 candidates awaiting trial on charges of crimes against women, he said. On Tuesday, the government set up a taskforce to monitor women&apos;s safety in Delhi and review whether police have been properly protecting women. The first batch of 40 Delhi police officers also started a three-day training course in rape investigation, which includes what advisors call a &quot;gender-sensitisation&quot; component. More than 18,000 suggestions from the public have been received by the judge heading one of the committees set up to overhaul rape laws. One move currently under consideration is to publish the names, pictures and addresses of convicted sex offenders on police websites. Police are awaiting findings on a bone test conducted on one of the suspects to confirm whether he is a juvenile or an adult, which could affect the charges against him. He is currently in special secure accommodation, while the five other accused are in Delhi&apos;s high-security Tihar jail. The Indian Bar Association last week decided against defending the six suspects because of the nature of the crime, although the court is expected to appoint lawyers to defend them. Indian media have reported that forensic evidence indicates the victim of the attack, who died on Saturday at a hospital in Singapore, struggled violently, repeatedly biting her assailants. &quot;She was a very, very, very cheerful little girl, and she was peace loving, and she was never embroiled in any controversies like this. I don&apos;t know why this happened to her,&quot; her uncle told the Associated Press. &quot;If the government can&apos;t punish them, give the rapists to the people. The people will settle the scores with them,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/jan/03/gus-odonnell-lessons-from-singapore", "sentences": ["Planning for the future, providing competitive rates of pay and encouraging involvement with the private sector are just three of the lessons the UK can learn from Singapore&apos;s civil service, according to former cabinet secretary and head of the civil service Gus O&apos;Donnell.", "The Singapore civil service, he says, &quot;have a pay policy which means they look at comparability with the private sector&quot;.", "They are way below the private sector at the top particularly, and therefore can&apos;t compete as much.&quot; He agrees with head of the Singapore civil service, Peter Ong, who stresses the importance of recruiting talent from the commercial world and allowing civil servants to continue their involvement with the private sector throughout their career.", "Although he cites Canada, Australia and the UK as positive examples, he adds that Singapore is outstanding in this respect.", "Finally, O&apos;Donnell says the UK civil service should follow Singapore&apos;s lead by becoming more forward-thinking and planning for the future."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-03T09:38:00Z", "title": "Gus O'Donnell: lessons from Singapore", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network"], "article": "Planning for the future, providing competitive rates of pay and encouraging involvement with the private sector are just three of the lessons the UK can learn from Singapore&apos;s civil service, according to former cabinet secretary and head of the civil service Gus O&apos;Donnell. Speaking as part of the Global Public Leaders Series, O&apos;Donnell says that when recruiting new talent, salaries that rival those of the private sector are an important incentive for the best and brightest to join. The Singapore civil service, he says, &quot;have a pay policy which means they look at comparability with the private sector&quot;. In the UK, on the other hand, &quot;we have very strict limits on [civil service] pay. They are way below the private sector at the top particularly, and therefore can&apos;t compete as much.&quot; He agrees with head of the Singapore civil service, Peter Ong, who stresses the importance of recruiting talent from the commercial world and allowing civil servants to continue their involvement with the private sector throughout their career. &quot;They take in very, very good people whose qualifications are such that they could make it to the top in the public or private sector, and then they work in both,&quot; O&apos;Donnell says. &quot;They allow their public servants to work in the private sector, and they have spells out in the private sector.&quot; O&apos;Donnell says that this engagement with the private sector encourages society to hold civil servants in high regard. &quot;If you just look at things, say, through a financial lens then you miss a really important part of things. We do need different sets of backgrounds, different sets of experiences, that can allow us to look at and imagine very different futures.&quot; Gender is another area where O&apos;Donnell says diversity needs to be encouraged. Although he cites Canada, Australia and the UK as positive examples, he adds that Singapore is outstanding in this respect. Finally, O&apos;Donnell says the UK civil service should follow Singapore&apos;s lead by becoming more forward-thinking and planning for the future. &quot;There&apos;s obviously a thought that thinking the unthinkable is quite dangerous in the UK. Information is all potentially disclosable now, so I think that&apos;s potentially embarrassing for governments.&quot; He adds that planning for the future has been intermittent for this reason, but says &quot;we shouldn&apos;t be embarrassed about it; we should actually be embarrassed about not doing it. The financial crisis has shown us that quite often shocks can come out of the blue, and we need to be ready for them.&quot; \u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Guardian public leaders network, email public.leaders@theguardian.com.

The attack on 16 December has caused outrage across India and led to demands for tough new rape laws and better police protection for women. It has also sparked an unprecedented debate about social attitudes to women. The five men, who were not present in court, are accused of rape, tampering with evidence, kidnapping, murder and other charges that could incur the death penalty. The charge sheet was not released. A sixth accused claims to be under 18 and is due to be tried separately in a juvenile court. The attack, which took place on a bus in New Delhi, left the victim with such severe internal injuries that she died two weeks later. A new fast-track court in south Delhi, inaugurated on Wednesday, will deal specifically with crimes against women. Police will ask for the death penalty, a move supported by the victim&apos;s father(video) who told reporters: &quot;The whole country is demanding that these monsters be hanged. I am with them.&quot; Executions are rare in India, where a &quot;rarest of the rare&quot; principle means that most of those who receive a death sentence are jailed for decades instead. In a sign of the depth of feeling surrounding the case, the bar association at the court said none of its members was willing to represent the accused. The court is expected to assign a defence lawyer for the men. Protests, though less numerous than over recent days and weeks, continued in the Indian capital and elsewhere. Recent incidents include a politician in north-east India reported to have assaulted a woman on Wednesday night, a teenage schoolgirl attacked by at least two men in the southern city of Puducherry, and a 17-year-old in Delhi who has accused two cousins of repeated rape. Altamas Kabir, the Indian chief justice, said the accused should be tried swiftly, but cautioned that they needed to be given a fair trial and not be subjected to mob justice. Police officials told the Guardian they were &quot;taking maximum security precautions&quot; to avoid &quot;any mishap&quot; when the accused are finally brought to the court. Hearings are likely to last several weeks, they said. Four other fast-track courts are planned in the capital to hold trials in sexual assault cases, which often get bogged down for years in India&apos;s notoriously sluggish court system. The country has a chronic lack of judges. Even if there were no new cases, it would take courts decades to clear the backlog of hundreds of thousands across the country. The new courts will work to provide swift justice &quot;so that the message is sent to all and sundry that these matters are going to be dealt with seriously&quot;, Kabir said. Indian states are also introducing new measures to combat sexual violence. In the northern state of Bihar, officials have asked the police to complete investigations in all 500 pending rape cases and charge the accused. Many cases never reach court. There is intense social pressure against families reporting sexual assaults and women are often blamed for attacks. When rapes are reported, police often refuse to file charges and pressure the victims to reach a compromise with their attackers. An investigation by the news magazine Tehelka revealed widespread misogyny among officers. Delhi police on Wednesday started new training sessions for thousands of investigating officers. In a sign that official attitudes towards such behaviour might be changing, authorities in the state of Punjab dismissed two police officers and suspended a third last week over accusations that they delayed investigating a reported gang rape and harassed the victim, who then killed herself. A number of other cases are being re-examined, with a 16-year-old case in the southern state of Kerala involving the alleged gang rape of a teenager over a period of weeks by more than 40 men now to be heard by India&apos;s supreme court. Women&apos;s activists hope that the rape and killing of the university student last month will mark a turning point in India&apos;s attitude toward women. The victim, whose name has not been revealed, was attacked after boarding a bus with a male companion after watching an evening showing of the film Life of Pi. The vehicle was a charter bus that illegally picked up the two passengers, authorities said. The driver was among the six arrested. The pair were attacked for at least an hour as the bus drove through the city, even passing through police checkpoints during the assault. They were eventually dumped naked on the side of the road. The woman was assaulted with an iron bar and suffered severe internal injuries that eventually caused her death on Saturday at a hospital in Singapore. Media reports say police have gathered 30 witnesses, and the charges have been detailed in a document running to more than 1,000 pages. Police also detained the owner of the bus over allegations that he used false documents to obtain permits to run the private bus service. Since the attack, women have held near-daily protests and candlelit vigils in New Delhi, demanding action to stop the daily harassment they face, from groping to more violent attacks. The Indian supreme court was on Thursday also expected to hear a petition demanding that Indian lawmakers facing sexual assault charges be suspended from office. Six state lawmakers are facing rape prosecutions and two national parliamentarians are facing charges of crimes against women that fall short of rape, said Jagdeep S Chhokar, an official with the Association for Democratic Reforms, which tracks political candidates&apos; criminal records. The petition from retired government administrator Promilla Shanker also asks the court to force the national government to fast-track thousands of rape cases across the country."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/04/china-fast-food-pioneer", "sentences": ["The chain immediately set itself apart in the late 1980s by hiring managers from other emerging Asian economies like Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, rather than the US."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-04T16:07:43Z", "title": "China's fast-food pioneer struggles to keep customers saying 'YUM!'", "tags": ["China", "Food & drink industry", "Fast food", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business", "Chicken"], "article": "Just south of the Forbidden City, past Mao Zedong&apos;s palatial mausoleum and across the road from Tiananmen Square, there is a more contemporary monument to Chinese life: the country&apos;s first KFC, established in 1987. The atmosphere in the outlet is as chaotic and diverse as the city beyond. A moustachioed teenager tries to sell a fake Rolex to a woman with a Prada handbag. Two old men in paint-spattered khakis laugh over coffee. A toddler sticks french fries into her ice cream cone. It was with this first outlet that KFC pioneered western fast food in mainland China. Its parent company, Kentucky-based YUM! Brands \u2013 which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell \u2013 now operates almost 4,500 outlets in the country; more than four out of five of them are KFCs. YUM! makes half its profits in China and the pace at which it is opening new outlets is still ferocious \u2013 it plans another 700 outlets there next year. McDonald&apos;s, its closest competitor, has about 2,000. Yet recent months have not been kind to KFC in China. The chain&apos;s same-store sales dropped 4% year-on-year in the past quarter; they had risen 21% in the same period last year. One day in late November, its share price dropped almost 10%. Conversations with KFC customers reveal the changing relationship between the Chinese and western fast food. &quot;This place is quick, it&apos;s convenient, it&apos;s sanitary, it&apos;s safe,&quot; said retired official Mrs Wang, 73, before biting into a spicy chicken sandwich. Huang Chong, a 26-year-old teacher, was less enthusiastic. &quot;Originally people thought KFC was great because it was from the west and really expensive,&quot; she said. &quot;But now people just think it&apos;s junk food.&quot; Many of the reasons for KFC China&apos;s recent troubles are macroeconomic \u2013 the country&apos;s GDP growth is slowing, even as labour costs and property prices rise. Yet analysts believe there are other factors at work. Chinese consumers are doing more of their shopping online, leaving once-lucrative shopping malls empty. As they grow richer, they&apos;ve begun to regard eating at KFC as less of a sign of status. They are also becoming more health-conscious. Then there was the recent &quot;45-day chicken&quot; food safety scare \u2013 an episode that laid bare the fragility of brand reputations. In late November, Chinese media accused one of the chain&apos;s Shanxi province-based suppliers of pumping its chickens full of noxious chemicals to ensure they were fully grown within 45 days. &quot;Reports claimed that the feedstuff Suhai prepared was so toxic it could even kill flies,&quot; said Xinhua, the country&apos;s official newswire. A Chinese Central Television report which aired last month accused another KFC supplier, Liuhe Group, of feeding its chickens a cocktail of illegal drugs and antibiotics. It is unclear whether or not the accusations constitute true-to-form food safety scandals, like the glowing pork, exploding watermelons and foul recycled oil that have made Chinese consumers hyperconscious about what and where they eat. KFC immediately denied the allegations about Suhai, and shortly afterwards, Shanxi provincial authorities concluded that the supplier&apos;s meat passed national standards. The chain has severed its ties with Liuhe and has agreed to &quot;actively co-operate&quot; with a government investigation into its use of antibiotics. But it was enough for social media users to take a hatchet to KFC&apos;s reputation. One called the chain Kentucky Toxic Chicken. &quot;American people don&apos;t eat it, so they take their poisonous garbage and bring it to China?! Resolutely do not eat it!&quot; wrote one user on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most popular microblog, which has 400 million users. 85% of respondents to a Sina Weibo poll said that they believed KFC and McDonald&apos;s chicken products were unsafe. Three quarters said that they would stop eating them. &quot;There is a massive social response against fast-growing chicken,&quot; said Yifeng Mao, the head of research at Shanghai-based Goldpebble Research. He added that a KFC executive brushed off questions about the scandals at an analyst meeting in New York this month. &quot;We think KFC or YUM! \u2013 those guys in the US \u2013 underestimate the severity of the food safety thing,&quot; he said. Meanwhile, the competition KFC faces is fierce. McDonald&apos;s has promised that by 2015 it will be opening a new restaurant in China every day. Burger King has announced plans to open 1,000 outlets by the end of the decade, presenting itself as a fresher, classier alternative to McDonald&apos;s. Chargrilled burger chain Carl&apos;s Jr has started popping up in Shanghai, and Californian chain Fatburger in Beijing. &quot;When McDonald&apos;s used to come to town, in second and third-tier cities, it was a big thing, like you&apos;d arrived as a town,&quot; said Paul French, chief China market strategist at the market research firm Mintel. &quot;That probably isn&apos;t true anymore.&quot; It is not just western style chains. Dicos, a Taiwanese chain which sells cumin-flavoured chicken fries and pineapple-chicken-mayonnaise sandwiches, has more than a thousand outlets in China, most of them in small cities. Chongqing-based fried chicken and rice restaurant Country Style Cooking listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. Its shares shot up 50% in a day. At the same time a number of domestic fast-food restaurants have emulated the type of brightly lit, sanitised, plastic environment that was once the exclusive province of western brands. HeheGu, founded eight years ago in Beijing, specialises in slow-cooked pork and bamboo shoots over rice. Last year, its profits grew by 45%. Another chain, Kungfu has found remarkable success selling Chinese comfort food \u2013 meat stews, boiled lettuce and soups. An image of Bruce Lee adorns its bright red shopfronts. But YUM! Brands seems sure of its continued dominance in China. Its other powerhouse chain, Pizza Hut, will open 220 outlets in the country next year. &quot;It&apos;s part of Chinese culture to respect the elderly, and the same goes with brands,&quot; said Warren Liu, a former vice-president of YUM!&apos;s predecessor Tricon Global Restaurants and author of a 2008 book about KFC&apos;s China strategy. &quot;Being the first \u2013 the pioneer into these remote corners of China \u2013 has continued to provide KFC with a substantial competitive advantage.&quot; Liu said KFC China&apos;s success comes from its longstanding ability to adjust to the country&apos;s vagaries and idiosyncrasies. The chain immediately set itself apart in the late 1980s by hiring managers from other emerging Asian economies like Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, rather than the US. It partnered with the right state-owned enterprises and established its own distribution centres at a time when the country wasn&apos;t traversed by reliable roads. Its menu is distinctly Chinese and constantly changing. Customers can order rice congee with pickles, egg custard tarts and tree fungus salad. The chain&apos;s rice dishes (meatballs, shrimp, Hungarian-flavoured beef) are just as popular as its fried chicken. Chinese Pizza Huts are also dramatically different from their western counterparts \u2013 pricey, low-lit, spacious. They offer squid, shrimp, and pineapple pizza. They&apos;re considered a good place to take a date. Sales aside, KFC-style fast-food chains have made an indelible mark on the fabric of everyday Chinese life. Sun Hongxia, a 28-year-old nutrition products salesperson, says she visits KFC to chat with friends, read and study. When there&apos;s no KFC around, she goes to McDonald&apos;s. When there&apos;s no McDonald&apos;s, she goes to Dicos. Yet she rarely orders any food. &quot;Nobody ever bothers you here,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s just a good place to come and sit.&quot; Additional research by Chuan Xu"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/04/rape-protests-spread-beyond-india", "sentences": ["One week after the Delhi rape victim died in a Singapore hospital, the widespread grief and outrage have moderated, but a fierce debate still rages over the country&apos;s sexual violence and attitudes to women."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-04T17:42:52Z", "title": "Rape protests spread beyond India", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Gender", "Feminism", "Women", "Bangladesh", "Protest", "Nepal", "Sri Lanka", "Pakistan"], "article": "Protests against sexual violence are spreading across south Asia as anger following the gang rape and death of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi courses through the region.

Bandana Rana, a veteran Nepalese activist, described the ongoing protests in Delhi as &quot;eye-opening&quot;. &quot;A few years back, women even talking about sexual violence or even domestic violence was a very rare,&quot; she said. Sultana Kamal, of the Bangladeshi human rights group Ain o Salish Kendra (ASK), said the protests in Delhi had given fresh impetus to protests against sexual violence. One incident that has provoked anger in Bangladesh was the alleged gang rape of a teenager by four men over four days in early December in Tangail, 40 miles north-west of Dhaka. The men were said to have made videos of the attack before leaving their victim near a rail track where she was eventually found by her brother. On Friday a teenager who was said to have been repeatedly raped in a hotel died in hospital in Dhaka of injuries sustained when she subsequently tried to take her own life. But despite the widespread anger, the social stigma attached to rape victims remains a major problem throughout the region. Although Bangladesh police arrested suspects in both the cases and investigations are under way, activists fear that corruption as well as deep-seated misogyny among investigating officers and the judiciary make convictions unlikely. According to ASK&apos;s statistics, at least 1,008 women were raped in 2012 in Bangladesh, of whom 98 were later killed. Khushi Kabir, one of the organisers of a &quot;human chain&quot; in Dhaka to protest against violence to women, said its aim was &quot;to show that people are not going to just let this [movement] die down&quot;. Kabir said although previous demonstrations on similar issues were largely dominated by women, men were now protesting too. The protests had also drawn people from a broad range of society. &quot;We had lawyers, schoolchildren, teachers, theatre activists and personalities, industrialists,&quot; she said. One week after the Delhi rape victim died in a Singapore hospital, the widespread grief and outrage have moderated, but a fierce debate still rages over the country&apos;s sexual violence and attitudes to women. One politician from the opposition BJP party was forced to apologise after stating the women who did not stay &quot;within moral limits \u2026 paid the price&quot;. A senior official in a hardline Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation provoked controversy when he claimed that westernisation was responsible for rapes in cities. The Delhi rape case is being heard in a special fast-track court inaugurated last week to deal with such offences in the capital. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Saturday. Protests however continue, albeit at a lower intensity than in previous weeks. The Indian media continue to give prominence to news items that would barely have received attention a month ago. On Friday it was reported that a 19-year-old woman had died in a hospital in the north-western city of Jaipur after she set herself on fire allegedly following aggressive harassment from a neighbour. She said the man had threatened to kill her brother and father if she did not marry him. In another incident reported on Friday a woman was said to have jumped from a moving train to escape an assault. Sexual harassment on public transport is endemic in India where men target single young women. Such abuse is described euphemistically as &quot;eve-teasing&quot; with perpetrators dubbed &quot;railway Romeos&quot;. One persistent problem, women say, is men filming their faces or bodies on mobile phones in buses or trains. Indian activists have repeatedly argued that media descriptions of such activities as &quot;eve-teasing&quot; contribute to the widespread acceptance of sexual harassment in public places. A recent survey by the Hindustan Times newspaper found that nearly 80% of women aged between 18 and 25 in Delhi had been harassed last year and more than 90% of men of the same age had &quot;friends who had made passes at women in public places&quot;. Nearly two-thirds of the latter thought the problem was exaggerated. It was also reported on Friday that though Delhi police had received 64 calls alleging a rape and 501 calls about harassment since 16 December, only four formal inquiries had been launched. Senior officials across the south Asian region have defended their government&apos;s records on tackling sexual violence against women. In Delhi, Sushilkumar Shinde, the Indian home secretary, said on Friday that crimes against women and marginalised sections of society were increasing, and it was the government&apos;s responsibility to stop them. &quot;This needs to be curbed by an iron hand,&quot; he told a conference of state officials from across India convened to discuss how to protect women. He called for changes in the law and the way police investigate cases so justice could be swiftly delivered. Many rape cases are bogged down in India&apos;s overburdened and sluggish court system for years. &quot;We need a reappraisal of the entire system,&quot; he said. Dr Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury, the Bangladeshi minister for women and children&apos;s affairs, said her government was &quot;taking this issue very seriously&quot;. &quot;Just yesterday [Thursday] a sex offender \u2026 was given a very high punishment under the law,&quot; she said, &quot;but sometimes the delay and the whole process of the trial takes a bit of time to ensure justice.&quot; Protests are expected on Saturday in Bangladesh following the news of a new incident: the rape and killing of a student in the south-east of the country. The 14-year-old is reported to have left home to bring in her family&apos;s cows in Rangamati district one evening earlier this week. Her uncle later found her body in a forest. An autopsy report later confirmed that she had been raped and then strangled. \u2022 Additional reporting: Ishwar Rauniyar in Kathmandu, Saad Hammadi, Dhaka."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jan/04/30-best-bargain-adventure-holidays-2013", "sentences": ["Art and gardens, Singapore There&apos;s a new 101-hectare green space just outside Singapore, called Gardens by the Bay, with waterfront planting and several &quot;Supertrees&quot; \u2013 16-storey gardens that collect rainwater and generate solar power, with a 128m suspended walkway between them.", "And from 25 January until 5 May, there&apos;s a big exhibition at the Singapore Art Museum, The Collectors Show: Weight of History, showing rare Asian artworks.", "This coincides with Art Stage 2013, a city-wide event of art shows.\u2022 Expedia (expedia.co.uk) has deals for bookings made in January, such as flights to Singapore from Heathrow, departing in March, for \u00a3600 Sahara adventure, Morocco     Ride a camel into the Moroccan Sahara    Make it an October half-term to remember with a camping trip in the Sahara."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-04T22:45:00Z", "title": "30 of the best bargain adventures in 2013", "tags": ["Adventure travel", "Flights", "Hotels", "Rail travel", "Travel"], "article": "Surfing and photography, Costa Rica Taking pictures of the sea is almost as tricky as surfing.

It will be their first public appearance since being detained two days after the attack three weeks ago. The men&apos;s full trial is due to start in a week in a new fast-track court inaugurated last week specifically to deal with sexual violence against women. A sixth accused, a juvenile, will be tried separately. Feelings are still running high in India, with many calling for wholesale reforms of laws and policing. The incident has also provoked a fierce debate on attitudes to women. Protests have occurred in neighbouring countries, inspired by the ongoing demonstrations in India. In his first interview since the attack, the male friend of the victim, who died in a Singapore hospital eight days ago, has described how passers-by left the pair lying unclothed and bleeding in the street for almost an hour. The graphic account in a television interview is likely to add fuel to public anger over the death in a country where official statistics show that one rape is reported every 20 minutes and where sexual harassment of women in public places is systematic. The woman&apos;s friend told the Zee News TV network that he was beaten unconscious with a metal bar by her attackers before the pair were thrown off the bus. They had boarded it in the mistaken belief it would take them home after an evening watching the film Life of Pi at a nearby shopping centre cinema. The women was raped for more than an hour and suffered internal injuries after an assault with an iron bar. The pair lay on the roadside for around 45 minutes before three police vans arrived. Officers then spent a long time arguing about where to take them, the man said. &quot;We kept shouting at the police, &apos;Please give us some clothes,&apos; but they were busy deciding which police station our case should be registered at,&quot; the man said in Hindi. Eventually, the officers fetched a sheet from a nearby hotel. The man said he himself, despite serious injuries, carried the victim to a police vehicle. Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat told Reuters that GPS records show the first police van reaching the scene four minutes after it was called. He said it left after seven minutes and arrived at a hospital within 24 minutes. The friend described the pair&apos;s attempts to call for help during the attack. &quot;We were shouting, trying to make people hear us. But they switched off the lights of the bus,&quot; he said, according to a transcript of the interview. When they were finally thrown out at a roadside near the city&apos;s airport, they pleaded with passers-by for help, he added in the studio interview. A blue metal crutch was leaning against his chair. &quot;There were a few people who had gathered round, but nobody helped. My friend was grievously injured and bleeding profusely. We were without clothes. We tried to stop passers-by. Several auto rickshaws, cars and bikes slowed down but none stopped for about 25 minutes. Then, someone on patrolling, stopped and called the police.,&quot; he said. The man also criticised delays and care at the public hospital where the pair were taken. He said they were again left without clothes or treatment for a protracted period. Neither the woman nor her friend have been named and the TV channel that ran the interview is under investigation by police who claim it has threatened their anonymity. His revelations will fuel further criticism of authorities in India who have alternated between public statements promising future reforms and a barely disguised contempt for the largely urban middle-class protestors who have taken to the streets over recent weeks. Huge gaps in the provision of security, healthcare and other basic services supposedly provided by the state have been exposed by the tragedy, deepening public anger. Metro stations in Delhi have been closed to prevent gatherings in the city centre. Thousands of police were deployed to protect parliament buildings and the homes of senior officials after the news of the attack spread. Analysts point to a growing gulf between a government used to a traditional opaque and paternalist style of politics and the accountability demanded by new voters. The victim&apos;s friend called on the protests to continue. &quot;If you can help someone, help them. If a single person had helped me that night, things would have been different. There is no need to close Metro stations and stop the public from expressing themselves. People should be allowed to have faith in the system,&quot; he said. He also said he wished people had come to his friend&apos;s help when she needed it: &quot;You have to help people on the road when they need help.&quot; According to Indian newspapers, the victim had to give a detailed statement twice because of an administrative dispute between officials. Her friend said he lay on a stretcher for four days in a police station without medical assistance after the attack."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/05/india-gang-rape-victim-blood", "sentences": ["Public prosecutor Rajiv Mohan told a judge in the south Delhi suburb of Saket that the men had attempted to destroy evidence by burning their clothes, but that parts of the burnt material had been found to have traces of blood from the victim, who died in a Singapore hospital eight days ago."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-05T19:30:20Z", "title": "India gang-rape victim's blood 'found on clothes of accused'", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "Society"], "article": "     Forensic evidence from the bus in which a 23-year-old Delhi student was gang-raped links the scene of the crime with men accused of her attack, a public prosecutor in the Indian capital claimed on Saturday.

Eventually, the officers fetched a sheet from a nearby hotel. He said they carried the victims to a police vehicle, despite their injuries. Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said records showed the first police van reaching the scene four minutes after it was called. He said it left after seven minutes and arrived at a hospital within 24 minutes. The friend described the pair&apos;s attempts to call for help during the attack. &quot;We were shouting, trying to make people hear us. But they switched off the lights of the bus,&quot; he said, according to a transcript of the interview. When they were finally thrown out at a roadside near the city&apos;s airport, they pleaded with passersby for help, he added in the studio interview. A blue metal crutch was leaning against his chair. &quot;There were a few people who had gathered round, but nobody helped. My friend was grievously injured and bleeding profusely. We were without clothes. We tried to stop passersby. Several auto-rickshaws, cars and bikes slowed down but none stopped for about 25 minutes. Then someone called the police,&quot; he said. The man also criticised delays and care at the public hospital where the pair were taken. He said they were again left without clothes or treatment for a long time. Neither the woman nor her friend have been named and the TV channel that ran the interview is under investigation by police, who claim it has threatened their anonymity. His revelations will fuel further criticism of authorities in India, who have alternated between promises of reform and a barely disguised contempt for the largely urban middle-class protesters who have taken to the streets over recent weeks. Huge gaps in the provision of security, healthcare and other basic services supposedly provided by the state have been exposed by the tragedy, deepening public anger. Underground railway stations in Delhi have been closed to prevent gatherings in the city centre. Thousands of police were deployed to protect parliament buildings and the homes of senior officials after the news of the attack spread. Analysts point to a growing gulf between a government used to a traditional opaque and paternalist style of politics and the accountability demanded by new voters. The victim&apos;s friend called on the protests to continue. &quot;If you can help someone, help them. If a single person had helped me that night, things would have been different. There is no need to close metro stations and stop the public from expressing themselves. People should be allowed to have faith in the system,&quot; he said. He also said he wished people had come to his friend&apos;s help when she needed it: &quot;You have to help people on the road when they need help.&quot; According to Indian newspapers, the victim had to give a detailed statement twice because of an administrative dispute between officials. Her friend said he lay on a stretcher for four days in a police station without medical assistance after the attack."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/06/mclaren-formula-one-motor-sport-skills-new-markets", "sentences": ["I watch Flewitt submit a finished 12C Spider bound for Singapore to a minute inspection."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-06T00:08:20Z", "title": "McLaren Formula One engineers set to cash in on winning formula", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "McLaren", "Motor sport", "Business"], "article": "Secretive billionaires, princes and superstars might supply the Formula One circuit with its brash glamour and pageantry but when the season returns with a roar in March, two of the cars tearing round Melbourne&apos;s Albert Park will have been constructed in a sleepy corner of Surrey. The McLaren Technology Centre (MTC) in Woking, exemplifies the quieter fortune being made by the UK motor sport industry: the Norman Foster-designed building is the centrepiece of a sector worth around \u00a36bn to the UK economy. Eight of the dozen F1 teams who competed in last year&apos;s championship are based in the UK, and McLaren, which came third in the constructor&apos;s league, is one of its most successful participants. At McLaren&apos;s headquarters, the relentless pressure of the F1 calendar is distilled to a zen-like focus. Long white corridors and glass lifts take visitors to an indoor boulevard: historic McLaren vehicles are lined up on one side, and an artificial lake can be glimpsed through a glass wall on the other. Ron Dennis, executive chairman of the group, which is majority owned by Bahrain&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, describes the atmosphere as &quot;a reassuring hush&quot;. The new racing car is being built behind frosted glass at one end of the boulevard. But McLaren is looking beyond motor sport: last year it opened a production centre next door, where it builds the 12C and 12C Spider sports cars \u2013 offshoots of decades of competing in the upper echelons of F1. Production of the \u00a3200,000 12C model is overseen by Mike Flewitt, who managed production of 8,500 vehicles a day when he was vice-president of manufacturing at Ford of Europe. McLaren produced a total of 1,552 cars in the whole of last year. &quot;We are a road car company that has developed from a race car company,&quot; he says. &quot;This is McLaren standards applied to state-of-the-art vehicle manufacture.&quot; At Ford, Flewitt operated to a cycle time \u2013 the time taken by a production line task \u2013 of 45 seconds. At McLaren it is 45 minutes. There is no conveyor belt, no noise from stamping machines or robots. The only sound is the squeak of tyres as completed models are driven across the white-tiled floor into testing booths. Flewitt says: &quot;If you have a white floor, it creates an imperative to keep it clean. It looks like this because we want it to be a great working environment. I also believe the aesthetic is vital. This gives you confidence in the quality of the product. It is difficult to give people that confidence if you work in a tatty facility.&quot; In contrast with mass-market manufacturers, the paint finish is applied manually by specialist staff rather than by robots. I watch Flewitt submit a finished 12C Spider bound for Singapore to a minute inspection. He praises the way the volcano-orange paint has been sprayed on to the contoured vehicle. &quot;Paints have different compositions,&quot; he says. &quot;The sprayer&apos;s art is to understand the model so you get an even finish.&quot; There would be no financial or aesthetic gain from spending millions of pounds on paint-spraying robots, he adds, instinctively flicking away a dust mote. Like their mass-produced counterparts, the majority \u2013 eight out of 10 \u2013 of McLaren sports cars will be exported. Four dealerships are opening in China this year. Elsewhere in the building are other examples of McLaren excellence, overseen by its McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT) arm, which supported Team GB in cycling, canoeing, rowing, kayaking and sailing at the 2012 Olympics. The rationale behind MAT is that McLaren should make more financial gain from its world-class abilities in design, analysis and production. At one end of the boulevard, propped next to an F1 car, is the \u00a325,000 Specialized S-Works Venge bike ridden by Mark Cavendish in the 2011 Tour de France, which McLaren helped design. The director of MAT, Geoff McGrath, says McLaren&apos;s skills in telemetry, or monitoring a car&apos;s performance through accumulated data, are the key. This allows McLaren to simulate how a car, or any product, will perform by building a computer model of it. McGrath says: &quot;We took a formula that worked very nicely for racing car design, then applied it to road car design, then bike design. We take the knowhow, the skills that we never commercialised, and hundreds of millions of pounds of research, and apply it to new markets.&quot; The healthcare market is the company&apos;s next target, he adds. The British automotive industry has delivered a strong performance in the post-crunch doldrums. But although Nissan added a further 280 jobs at its plant in Sunderland last month, carmakers are unlikely to open new sites here; what is more probable is that they will follow the example of home-grown Jaguar Land Rover, which recently started work on a factory in China. Instead, the hope is that suppliers \u2013 the makers of nuts, bolts and components \u2013 can spur domestic growth. There is an estimated \u00a33bn worth of unsatisfied demand for UK-made components. Flewitt says about 50% of the McLaren sports car&apos;s suppliers are UK-based. But the key, state-of-the-art component, its carbon-fibre chassis, is made in Austria. Flewitt believes that could change \u2013 McLaren has already done much of the hard work by designing the kit. &quot;It is a technology where we in the UK can be very competitive,&quot; he says, adding that the government can help by bringing in production partners and wooing potential customers. Nick Henry of consultancy ICF GHK says Britain&apos;s F1 industry has dominated the sport for more than 30 years despite attempts to develop rival hubs in Bahrain, Malaysia and South Africa: &quot;The history of F1 is continued UK success in the face of globalisation, which is chipping away at it but feeding its growth at the same time. These are flexible small and medium-sized businesses doing high-quality engineering. There has been churn in [team] ownership but behind it this core of British engineering creates products the world pays for.&quot; Amid the clamour over the need to rebalance Britain&apos;s struggling economy, the long-term success of the country&apos;s motor sport industry offers a quiet lesson in how it can be done."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/jan/07/debts-bangladeshi-migrants-jailed-abroad", "sentences": ["I think by bringing these men home, we&apos;ve brightened the lives of 20 families.&quot; Headquartered in Singapore and with operations spanning Asia and the Middle East, MGH Group has partnered Bmet before."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-07T07:00:01Z", "title": "Debts, dreams and middle men haunt Bangladeshi migrants jailed abroad | Syed Zain Al-Mahmood", "tags": ["Migration and development", "Global development", "Bangladesh", "World news", "Remittances"], "article": "The guard had a shiny bald head and bloodshot eyes. Every time he walked by, he spat and muttered in Swahili, &quot;Beggars! Stinking beggars!&quot; Biltu Mia, 31, from the Manikganj district of central Bangladesh, cannot get the memory out of his head. He spent nearly a year in Tanzania&apos;s notorious Ukonga prison, on the outskirts of Dar-es-Salaam, after being picked up by immigration police in October 2011. Mia says he slept in a space 3ft across and had to trade prison food for a tunic after his only shirt started to rot. The toilets overflowed and the guards carried out rectal searches when hunting for cigarettes and contraband. &quot;I was sure I would die there,&quot; Mia says. &quot;One of our companions, a Bangladeshi, died of starvation and disease.&quot; When he left home in search of a better life, in July 2011, Mia had no idea he would end up in an east African prison. The youngest son of a rice farmer, he had been recruited by a local &quot;manpower agent&quot;, who promised him a lucrative job as a professional driver in Durban, South Africa. Instead, Mia and another man from his area were flown to Kampala, Uganda, and then on to Dar-es-Salam via Kenya. They were told by local agents that they would need to stay in Tanzania for a few days while their papers were processed. The days stretched into months before Mia, and eight other Bangladeshis living in the same house, were picked up in a police raid. &quot;Our passports had been taken by the recruiters. We had no papers and no money to pay fines or bribes. The guards openly told us that we would spend the rest of our lives in prison,&quot; Mia says. Mia&apos;s case is not an isolated one. In Bangladesh, where half the population lives on less than $1.20 a day, migrant labour is regarded as an important livelihood option. But experts fear that thousands of Bangladeshis could be in limbo in the Middle East and Africa after being duped by recruiters. Many would-be migrants end up behind bars for immigration offences, and others face the daunting prospect of returning home with nothing but their debts. &quot;The high cost of migration and the involvement of shady agents encourages what we call irregular migration,&quot; says Selim Reza, a researcher with the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, an affiliate of the University of Dhaka. &quot;Many Bangladeshi migrants find themselves in situations close to slavery. They can&apos;t get legal status and often they don&apos;t have the means to come back home.&quot; In August 2012, the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (Bmet) of the Bangladesh government, learned about the plight of Mia and 19 other Bangladeshis. As the Bangladeshis were &quot;illegals&quot; the agency couldn&apos;t use government funds to help them, according to Mohsin Chowdhury, welfare director of Bmet. To get around the legal hurdle, the bureau worked with the MGH Group, one of Bangladesh&apos;s largest corporations, with interests in banking, logistics, shipping, and food and beverages, to bring the stranded Bangladeshis home. On 21 September 2012, Mia returned to Dhaka. &quot;The migrant worker is the unsung hero of our economy,&quot; Anis Ahmed, managing director of MGH Group, says. &quot;We wanted to give back to society by doing something. I think by bringing these men home, we&apos;ve brightened the lives of 20 families.&quot; Headquartered in Singapore and with operations spanning Asia and the Middle East, MGH Group has partnered Bmet before. In April 2009, the company brought back seven Bangladeshi migrant workers who had served nearly a decade in a Pakistani jail without a conviction. Ahmed says his company is working to rescue Bangladeshis stranded in countries from Lebanon to Kazakhstan. &quot;We&apos;re working with Bmet to track down and rescue Bangladeshis who are trapped abroad,&quot; Ahmed says. &quot;But I hope the government will tackle the conditions that get them into trouble in the first place.&quot; More than 600,000 Bangladeshis left to fill overseas jobs in 2012, according to Bmet. Remittances from wage earners stood at $12.8bn (\u00a37.8bn) in the fiscal year ending 30 June 2012 \u2013 roughly six times higher than the official development assistance and 11 times the foreign direct investment in Bangladesh. But despite being a crucial lifeline, experts say the sector is beset with problems, with many analysts blaming costly and corrupt recruiting practices and the lack of co-ordinated government initiatives for the vulnerability of migrants. Dr Ahsan Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute, a Dhaka-based thinktank, said: &quot;Most Bangladeshi migrants are paying the equivalent of a year&apos;s earnings on a three-year contract, in recruitment and travel costs. With multiple layers of middlemen involved, the agent dealing with the worker in Bangladesh may not know much about the job, while the recruiter in the country of destination may not know anything about the worker.&quot; Mia&apos;s father, Mofiz Uddin, sold a piece of land and took out a high-interest loan from a local loan shark to send his son abroad. &quot;I paid the recruiter a total of 1m taka (\u00a37,600),&quot; Uddin says. &quot;It was every taka I had. But when my son went missing, they refused to accept any responsibility.&quot; Ali Haider Chowdhury, general secretary of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies, representing the country&apos;s nearly 800 agencies \u2013 denies that his association had failed to purge itself of agents who operate outside the law. &quot;We warn people to deal only with government-approved recruiters,&quot; he says. &quot;But many people in the rural areas prefer to deal with local subagents they know rather than Dhaka-based recruiting agencies.&quot; Back in Manikganj, Mia says he is being pursued by the creditors who lent his family money to send him abroad. The government has no comprehensive reintegration scheme for returning migrants and Mia hasn&apos;t found work since his return. &quot;I&apos;m glad to see my family,&quot; he said. &quot;But this is like being in prison all over again.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/jan/07/drama-subject-government-education", "sentences": ["In the interview he refers glowingly and narrowly to education in Singapore as an exemplar \u2013 again.", "Does he realise that, in the past couple of years, Singapore has restructured its ministry of education, raised the profile of the arts and appointed a curriculum officer for drama?", "Does he realise that in 2013, arts ministry staff from Singapore are coming to England to find out more about arts education in schools?"], "publicationDate": "2013-01-07T09:53:00Z", "title": "Drama is a subject, despite what the government thinks", "tags": ["Education", "Teacher Network", "Schools", "Secondary schools", "Primary schools", "Teaching", "English and creative writing", "Drama and dance"], "article": "In October, I wrote about how a narrow focus on core English baccalaureate subjects is putting performing arts and qualified drama teachers at risk. Just as drama teachers were thinking that it couldn&apos;t get much worse for their subject, it has. A letter sent in November 2012, from the Department for Education (DfE) to the Birmingham Repertory theatre, suggests drama is not a subject in the minds of ministers. The letter reads: &quot;Ministers do not consider drama to be core knowledge, as it is more a question of pedagogy and therefore outside the remit of the (primary) curriculum review.&quot; To suggest drama is &quot;a question of pedagogy&quot; is politically expedient but complete nonsense. How and why have ministers arrived at this damaging conclusion? Did they actually talk with any drama specialist teachers or did they just decide this for themselves without real consultation? Drama already seemed doomed when it did not appear at all in the primary national curriculum consultation questions to &quot;stakeholders&quot; or in the draft national curriculum. Currently it sits like a cuckoo in the nest of English and has grown in recent years. Clearly it is about to be thrown from its safe curriculum nest as a statutory part of the current English curriculum. Primary teachers and the public have not been asked whether they consider drama to be important in a primary curriculum or whether they consider it to be a subject. Ministers have not even spoken directly with National Drama, a professional association for drama and theatre educators, despite the fact we have repeatedly requested a meeting. It seems that ministers do not feel they need to talk with subject specialists unless they are from subjects they choose to acknowledge. Maybe they don&apos;t want to listen to views or research that does not fit in with their own preconceived ideas and archaic notions of what constitutes a curriculum and what learning is. Drama is a subject, even if government ministers in England, with no drama knowledge choose to decide otherwise. Are other countries that have drama in their curriculum labouring under an illusion then? How did Australia, New Zealand, Ontario, Northern Ireland and Scotland manage to produce a drama curriculum if drama is just pedagogy? Iceland is next and may be followed by Finland. Drama is a subject that can also form the basis of a particularly powerful pedagogy in schools. However, drama as pedagogy relies on teachers having drama subject knowledge, skills and in order for them to give children the chance to learn both in drama (as a subject) and through drama (as pedagogy). You can&apos;t teach through a subject you have not gained knowledge of. The DfE letter goes on to say: &quot;As you know, where drama features in the primary English programme of study it is in relation to pupils studying great works of great dramatists, including Shakespeare.&quot; Presumably, ministers like Shakespeare. They experienced it in their own education, so it must exist and it must be good. It&apos;s recognisable to ministers (not like this new fangled drama that they have never personally &quot;studied&quot; and so don&apos;t personally understand and don&apos;t want to). Ministers are probably privileged to see Shakespeare&apos;s plays performed brilliantly by the RSC. They might ask themselves how many great English actors entered the profession because of good drama teachers in schools introducing them to drama? Ironically, reading and testing student&apos;s knowledge of Shakespeare will probably survive in schools, even if drama as a subject doesn&apos;t. Shakespeare would turn in his grave. He wrote for performance, not for tests. Maybe children in future will just read Shakespeare. After all, performing it would run the risk of acknowledging it as drama. There is a yet another insult for drama teachers lurking within the letter to Birmingham Rep from the DfE. It states that the review is aiming to &quot;give school leaders and teachers much greater flexibility to design and manage their own curriculum, and to teach subjects and topics like drama in ways that inspire and excite their pupils as part of a broad and balanced curriculum&quot;. Is the DfE saying here that drama is a subject but just not an important enough one for all children to have, so schools can teach if they choose (with no guidance), or are they saying drama is just a &quot;topic&quot;? There is a lack of clarity in this sentence that may be deliberate. One thing is certain, the DfE is passing the buck to schools about everything that they don&apos;t want to enforce. Is that curriculum freedom? If arts teachers want to get truly depressed, they should go to YouTube to hear Michael Gove speaking at the Institute of Education on the &apos;topic&apos;, What does an educated person look like? He fidgets his way through a muddle of personal educational ideologies that leave the listener in despair. The word drama falls rapidly off the lips of Gove once, (after about 45 minutes) but unfortunately an ill-timed interruption by the interviewer David Aaronovitch results in Gove immediately dropping the subject (pun intended). A few minutes later, a well-framed question from a woman in the audience (greeted by audience applause), asks him about the lack of arts in the Ebaccs. She does not receive an immediate or clear answer. When will Gove directly and honestly answer criticism about the devastating impact he is having on arts education, rather than keep churning out his 1950s vision? When will he stop retreating into invalid international comparisons selected to support his ideology? In the interview he refers glowingly and narrowly to education in Singapore as an exemplar \u2013 again. Does he realise that, in the past couple of years, Singapore has restructured its ministry of education, raised the profile of the arts and appointed a curriculum officer for drama? Does he realise that in 2013, arts ministry staff from Singapore are coming to England to find out more about arts education in schools? Will there be any? Does he care?

But rowdy scenes in the packed courtroom delayed hearings for much of the day and raised concerns over the capacity of India&apos;s creaking judicial system to deal with such a sensitive and high-profile case. The five men, along with a teenager, are accused of raping a 23-year-old physiotherapy student on a bus in New Delhi. She died two weeks later on 28 December in a Singapore hospital from her injuries. The case provoked outrage in India and around the world with protests continuing on Monday. Local authorities have proposed a range of measures aiming to make the country safer for women, ranging from more CCTV cameras to gender sensitisation lessons for schoolchildren. But another alleged gang-rape and murder over the weekend in Noida, a satellite city east of Delhi, has led to fresh protests and further accusations that the police do not take such offences seriously. Monday&apos;s court hearing took place amid chaos and confusion after police failed to restrict access to the courtroom and rows broke out between local lawyers over whether or not the men should be defended. A blue police van brought the five defendants from Delhi&apos;s high security Tihar jail in the morning, but after long delays, the magistrate, Namrita Aggarwal, ordered police to clear the room and that the hearing be held behind closed doors. Media organisations are seeking to reverse the order amid confusion over whether it would apply to the entire trial. The case is being heard by a newly created &quot;fast-track court&quot;, set up to allow speedy justice. Legal proceedings in India often involve years, even decades, of delay. A teenager who is also accused is expected be tried separately in a juvenile court. There is growing support in India for legal changes to allow the suspect, believed to be 17 years old, to face a harsher sentence than the maximum of three years&apos; imprisonment he could expect if convicted. But there was confusion over the youth&apos;s exact age with judges at the juvenile court asking for further evidence at a pre-trial hearing on Monday. Two of the defendants are reported to have said they are willing to testify against the other men, but police have rejected the request, according to local media. Legal experts have already raised concerns about the standards observed in the trial. Although they have been held for more than three weeks and repeatedly interrogated by police, the defendants still do not have defence lawyers, who will be assigned by the court before the trial begins in around a week. Members of the bar association in the South Delhi district where the case is being heard vowed not to represent them and physically fought with lawyers proposing their services in the courtroom. But experts warn that a lack of representation for the accused so far could give grounds for appeal later should they be found guilty. Similar cases have resulted in acquittals years after convictions. &quot;The accused has a right to a lawyer from point of arrest \u2013 the investigations are going on, statements being taken, it is totally illegal,&quot; said Colin Gonsalves, a senior supreme court advocate and director of Delhi&apos;s Human Rights Law Network. A government panel is considering suggestions to make the death penalty mandatory for rape and introducing forms of chemical castration for the guilty. It is due to make its recommendations by 23 January. Official data shows one rape is reported on average every 20 minutes in India. India set up 1,700 fast-track courts in 2004 but stopped funding them in 2012 because they turned out to be costly. The courts typically work six days a week and try to reduce adjournments that lead to long delays in cases. &quot;The record of the fast-track courts is mixed,&quot; Gonsalves said. Conviction rates rose, he said, but due process was sometimes rushed, leading to convictions being overturned."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/08/climate-change-debt-inequality-threat-financial-stability", "sentences": ["&quot;We are not seeing the state leadership necessary to tackle these risks.&quot; While praising the attempts by countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and China to improve their resilience, the WEF said the immediate challenge of coping with economic problems was making governments reluctant to address the long-term threat of climate change."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-08T13:17:00Z", "title": "Climate change, debt and inequality 'threaten financial stability'", "tags": ["Global economy", "Davos", "Business", "Economics", "World news", "Climate change", "Environment", "Financial crisis", "Davos 2013"], "article": "Persistent economic weakness is sapping the ability of governments to tackle the growing threat of climate change and risks a global &quot;perfect storm&quot; of intertwined financial and ecological collapse, the World Economic Forum has warned. In the runup to its annual meeting in Davos this month, the WEF used its annual Global Risks report to urge policy leaders to step up efforts to tackle the three big dangers cited by a panel of 1,000 experts: severe income disparities, the indebted state of governments and rising greenhouse gas emissions. &quot;These global risks are essentially a health warning regarding our most critical systems,&quot; said Lee Howell, the report&apos;s editor. &quot;National resilience to global risks needs to be a priority so that critical systems continue to function despite a major disturbance.&quot; The report showed that for the second year running, the widening income gap, chronic fiscal imbalances and greenhouse gas emissions were seen as the three most likely threats to emerge over the coming decade. Of those risks considered likely to have the biggest impact on the global community, a major systemic financial failure and a water supply crisis were again deemed to be the most serious, followed by chronic fiscal imbalances, food shortages and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Howell said the fact that the key risks in 2013 were the same as they had been in 2012 reflected a sense that policymakers were failing to get to grips with the threats. &quot;There is a feeling that we are not making progress&quot;, he said at the launch of the report in London. &quot;We are not seeing the state leadership necessary to tackle these risks.&quot; While praising the attempts by countries such as Switzerland, Singapore, Australia and China to improve their resilience, the WEF said the immediate challenge of coping with economic problems was making governments reluctant to address the long-term threat of climate change. &quot;Continued stress on the global economic system is positioned to absorb the attention of leaders for the foreseeable future,&quot; the report said. &quot;Meanwhile, the Earth&apos;s environmental system is simultaneously coming under increasing stress. Future simultaneous shocks to both systems could trigger the &apos;perfect global storm&apos; with potentially insurmountable consequences. &quot;On the economic front, global resilience is being tested by bold monetary and austere fiscal policies. On the environmental front, the Earth&apos;s resilience is being tested by rising global temperatures and extreme weather events that are likely to become more frequent and severe. A sudden and massive collapse on one front is certain to doom the other&apos;s chances of developing an effective, long-term solution.&quot; Each year, the WEF asks its panel of experts to compile a list of the 50 key risks. The 2013 study showed how views had changed since the start of the global financial crisis in mid 2007. At the start of that year, the five risks most frequently cited were a breakdown of critical information infrastructure, chronic disease in developed countries, an oil price shock, a hard landing in China and an asset price collapse. The five risks deemed likely to have the biggest impact were an asset price collapse, retrenchment from globalisation, interstate and civil wars, pandemics and an oil price shock. Social media threat The report cited two other causes for global concern: a false sense of security over health and digital wildfires. &quot;Huge strides forward in health have left the world dangerously complacent. Rising resistance to antibiotics could push overburdened health systems to the brink, while a hyperconnected world allows pandemics to spread,&quot; the WEF said. It added that the internet could be the source of global panic. &quot;Social media allows information to spread around the world at breakneck speed in an open system where norms and rules are starting to emerge but have not yet been defined. While the benefits of our hyperconnected communication systems are undisputed, they could potentially enable the viral spread of information that is intentionally or unintentionally misleading or provocative.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jan/08/life-of-pi-global-vision-cinema", "sentences": ["But a lightbulb flashed over someone&apos;s head, somewhere at Fox, during the development process: Life of Pi&apos;s release schedule was Asia-frontloaded, with Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, India, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Pakistan all within the first fortnight.", "This interesting Singaporean report reckons that Chinese tweeters, rather than soaking up a message of spiritual affirmation, have erred towards the bleaker reading of the film that is certainly there too, possibly because it connects with the grislier episodes of the country&apos;s postwar history."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-08T17:09:37Z", "title": "Life of Pi: a global vision for mainstream cinema", "tags": ["Ang Lee", "Film", "Culture", "Life of Pi", "Bollywood", "Film adaptations"], "article": "In Life of Pi, it&apos;s the English actor who is drafted in to speak up for the film&apos;s internationalist credentials. &quot;So far we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool on a Japanese ship full of animals heading off to Canada,&quot; the writer played by Rafe Spall says, just before the ordeal on the high seas begins.

Among the mostly strong figures in territories across the region were two standout performances: $13m in India, where local star Irrfan Khan and a $1m marketing spend \u2013 the highest ever in distributor Fox Star India&apos;s history \u2013 helped the film punch its weight against Bollywood; and over $90m in China, where it become only the second US film, after Titanic 3D, to gross more than in North America. Chinese filmgoers flocked to social media to debate Lee&apos;s film fable: more than five million messages were exchanged, discussing the meaning of the carnivorous island and the open ending, on Sina Weibo, the country&apos;s Twitter equivalent. &quot;I didn&apos;t realise the movie really has an Asian vibe,&quot; Lee claimed recently. But a lightbulb flashed over someone&apos;s head, somewhere at Fox, during the development process: Life of Pi&apos;s release schedule was Asia-frontloaded, with Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, India, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Pakistan all within the first fortnight. There&apos;s definitely something in the film&apos;s delirious, almost abstract beauty that&apos;s reminiscent of Chinese and Hong Kong cinema aesthetics, and its matter-of-fact syncretism is very Asian, too. Life of Pi seems happy to have the same loosely tethered relationship with western dramatic norms and values as Pi&apos;s raft does with the lifeboat, whether it&apos;s consciously or not in Yann Martel&apos;s original novel, or the rhythms introduced by Lee and screenwriter David Magee over a reported 170 drafts. This pliability isn&apos;t surprising, given Lee&apos;s past cultural circumnavigations. When he moved from Taiwan to the US in 1979 to study theatre, he says he was struck by the differing emphasis of Brecht, Tennessee Williams and other western dramatic heavyweights. &quot;I only understood about half of what was going on, but just the look of western theatre struck me in a big way,&quot; he later told the New Yorker. &quot;You exert your feelings. You outcry. You use drama to do the bang and through that, purge your feelings. It was a big culture shock to me. You&apos;ve got to verbalise conflict on stage. I got very good at it.&quot; Lee used what he had learned when he made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, returning to the wuxia genre of classical Chinese tradition, but seeding it with western psychoanalytic character-development (the slow, 15-minute, motivation-establishing opening confounded all cut-to-the-furniture-smashing kung fu film conventions). But that film was only a qualified box-office success in Asia at the end of 2000. Lust, Caution stirred up plenty of controversy in China thanks to its focus on collaboration with the Japanese, but its drama ploughed that western psychological furrow. Pi, with its numinously mythic storytelling, feels like a much more thoroughly metamorphosed piece of work. The clamorous Asian response suggests this new east-west fusion is a triumph, able to travel around the globe without attracting attention from the cultural-difference police. Well, almost. It has been a recurring criticism among reviewers \u2013 our own Peter Bradshaw among them \u2013 that Life of Pi lacks the philosophical heft to back up its transcendental visuals, and that the conundrum offered up to us in the final scenes verges on the spiritually glib. It might be tempting to chalk that up to godless western critics bridling at the film&apos;s default religiosity, if it weren&apos;t for the fact that critics from elsewhere have made similar remarks. But it&apos;s undeniable that earnest public discussion of the film seems more deeply rooted in Asia, and sometimes in unexpected ways. This interesting Singaporean report reckons that Chinese tweeters, rather than soaking up a message of spiritual affirmation, have erred towards the bleaker reading of the film that is certainly there too, possibly because it connects with the grislier episodes of the country&apos;s postwar history. I doubt Lee would claim to have &quot;cracked&quot; China \u2013 or Asia. But he looks more and more like an outlier who, whether by design or instinct, is able to produce fluent, sophisticated entertainment that looks like Hollywood but doesn&apos;t necessarily speak it. There aren&apos;t many directors with that kind of flexibility and global sensitivity; as China and other markets continue to come to the fore, it could be directors like Lee who sculpt what the mainstream looks like over the next 25 years. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood looks at Quentin Tarantino&apos;s sphere of influence.

The preliminary inquiry, which comes as the Socialist government clamps down on tax evasion, will seek to establish whether J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac once had a secret bank account in Switzerland hidden from the French authorities. Cahuzac, 60, a former MP and cardiologist who became a plastic surgeon specialising in hair transplants, is in charge of French tax policy and has been leading the government&apos;s efforts to cut the deficit. He has repeatedly denied allegations made by the investigative website Mediapart that he held an undisclosed account at the Swiss bank UBS for 20 years until 2010. The site alleged he travelled to Switzerland to close the Geneva-based account and transfer money to Singapore just before he was made head of the parliamentary finance commission in February 2010. Mediapart published a recording in which Cahuzac is alleged to be talking to his wealth manager about his embarrassment over the Swiss bank account in 2000. In the recording, a voice said to be Cahuzac&apos;s says: &quot;What bothers me is that I still have an account open with UBS \u2026 UBS is not necessarily the most hidden of banks.&quot; Cahuzac, who denied the reports and said the voice in the recording was not his, is suing Mediapart for defamation. His office welcomed the preliminary investigation, saying it would allow him to prove his &quot;complete innocence of the absurd allegations that he has been subjected to&quot;. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande promised during his presidential campaign that his government would be beyond reproach, so the state prosecutor&apos;s preliminary investigation is an embarrassment, especially as the government has increased income tax on the richest. It has also criticised wealthy individuals, such as the actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu, who have sought to shift their tax base abroad. The prosecutor&apos;s office said it had no option but to open an inquiry immediately given the sensitivity of the allegations against Cahuzac and the time it would take to investigate them. The \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace and prime minister&apos;s office gave support to Cahuzac when Mediapart first published the allegations last month. The editor of Mediapart, Edwy Plenel, told the iTele TV channel that he stood by the story. He said: &quot;There is one question we need to ask our government, prime minister and president. Can the budget minister, the head of the tax administration, carry out his work properly and legitimately when there is enough evidence to open a preliminary investigation?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/08/virgin-atlantic-american-airlines-ceo-craig-kreeger", "sentences": ["Delta bought the stake from Singapore Airlines in a \u00a3224m deal and announced an alliance with Virgin Atlantic that allows the two carriers to co-operate on setting fares and flight schedules, which will require clearance from competition authorities."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-08T18:33:00Z", "title": "Virgin Atlantic hires American Airlines executive as new CEO", "tags": ["Virgin Atlantic", "Airline industry", "Business"], "article": "Virgin Atlantic has signalled its determination to fight back against heightened competition on the lucrative London-to-New York corridor by hiring an American Airlines executive as its new boss. Craig Kreeger will replace Steve Ridgway next month, after a 27-year career at AA where he presided over the carrier&apos;s airport operations, inflight service and baggage handling as senior vice president for customers. He was chosen ahead of the favourite internal candidate, Julie Southern, Virgin Atlantic&apos;s chief commercial officer. Kreeger must tackle a series of strategic challenges faced by Virgin Atlantic, headed by the growing competitive threat in the transatlantic market and the launch of a Heathrow-to-Scotland short-haul business. His appointment follows an overhaul of Virgin Atlantic&apos;s ownership structure last year in which America&apos;s Delta Air Lines took 49% in the carrier launched by Sir Richard Branson in 1984. Delta bought the stake from Singapore Airlines in a \u00a3224m deal and announced an alliance with Virgin Atlantic that allows the two carriers to co-operate on setting fares and flight schedules, which will require clearance from competition authorities. Branson, Virgin Atlantic&apos;s president, underlined the importance of the Delta alliance in the appointment of Kreeger, who has worked on airline joint ventures at AA. He said: &quot;We are thrilled to welcome Craig to Virgin Atlantic \u2013 he is the right person to succeed Steve Ridgway at this dynamic and challenging time for our airline. We believe Craig has the experience and passion to drive Virgin Atlantic forward and capitalise on the opportunities created by our new venture with Delta Airlines.&quot; Virgin Atlantic reported a pre-tax loss last year of \u00a380m, which it blamed on economic uncertainty, high fuel costs and flight taxes imposed by the UK government. Douglas McNeill, analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said: &quot;Not content with copying the transatlantic joint venture that American formed with BA, Virgin Atlantic has now poached one of its senior executives, as well. The new man&apos;s goal must be to restore profitability to a level commensurate with the tremendous strength of the brand.&quot; Virgin Atlantic has waged a public relations battle against AA in recent years in a bid to prevent AA and British Airways from signing a transatlantic alliance that would allow the carriers to collude on setting fares, schedules and routes. The campaign failed and the launch of the joint venture underlined the scale of the competitive threat faced by Virgin Atlantic. It owns 3.3% of the slots at Heathrow airport, whereas BA alone controls 52%. Between them, BA and AA control 60% of transatlantic seats. The Delta/Virgin Atlantic alliance will resemble the AA/BA deal and represents the resumption of a more conventional rivalry between BA and Branson&apos;s carrier after a recent outbreak of verbal hostilities between the tycoon and BA&apos;s ultimate boss, Willie Walsh. Walsh, chief executive of BA&apos;s parent, International Airlines Group, last month bet Branson a &quot;knee in the groin&quot; that Virgin Atlantic&apos;s brand would disappear in the wake of the Delta deal. However, Kreeger can expect a less tumultuous relationship with Walsh, who has emphasised his respect for Ridgway&apos;s abilities in the past, reserving his ire for Branson. Kreeger said he was looking to build &quot;the next exciting chapter&quot; at Virgin Atlantic. He said: &quot;It is a great airline renowned for its customer service and innovation. I have been competing with it for many years but have always admired its laser focus on its people, its products and its customers.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/09/luxembourg-player-nearly-win-ballon-dor", "sentences": ["Indonesia and Thailand had both already qualified for the semi-finals where Singapore and the hosts Vietnam awaited.", "Indonesia instead drew Singapore and Thailand faced Vietnam.", "A certain amount of justice was served in the semis, though, as Singapore defeated Indonesia and Thailand were beaten by Vietnam.&quot; The goals from the 3-2 game can be seen here:            IF YOU CAN FIND THEM, MAYBE YOU CAN HIRE \u2026 THE B-TEAM &quot;While the Sporting Lisbon B team are second in second tier, the first team is one point outside relegation zone in the top tier."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-09T08:45:00Z", "title": "Did a Luxembourg player nearly win the Ballon d'Or? | The Knowledge", "tags": ["Ballon d'Or", "Football", "Sport"], "article": " &quot;A friend of mine swears a player from Luxembourg was once in the running for the Ballon d&apos;Or,&quot; writes Shaun Sleeth. &quot;I can find any hard evidence for it. And, to be fair, he hasn&apos;t produced anything either. Is he right? There&apos;s a pint riding on it \u2026&quot; Well, Shaun, it looks like you&apos;ll have to get yourself to the bar as he is indeed right, in a sense at least. It depends what you mean by &quot;in the running&quot; and in fact, if you&apos;re liberal with the definition, you can argue that three Luxembourgers fit the bill. You can make your own mind up about the significance or otherwise of a Luxembourg journalist on the award&apos;s voting panel. The first player in question is Robby Langers, a striker who scored eight goals for Luxembourg in his 73 international appearances (not bad going when you consider the team as a whole scored only 26 times in those games). Langers&apos; appearance on the Ballon d&apos;Or shortlist came in 1989, a year he began with US Orl\u00e9ans in the French second division. The summer saw a transfer to Nice and by the time the Ballon d&apos;Or was announced in December, although the club were on their way to a finish in the relegation zone their Luxembourger was on his way to 17 league goals and third spot in the Ligue 1 scorers chart. That was a notable achivement, sure, but one to to put him in contention for what was then essentially a version of the European footballer of the year award? Somebody thought so. Langers picked up one fifth-place vote from the 27 journalist judges, meaning he finished joint 23rd in the Ballon d&apos;Or ballot, level with Thomas Hassler, Ronald Koeman, Gary Lineker, Paolo Maldini and Gianluca Vialli. Two years later Standard Li\u00e8ge stalwart Guy Hellers also picked up a single fifth-placed vote. The midfielder had captained Standard to the last eight of the Cup Winners&apos; Cup (where they were on the end of a 6-1 shellacking from Juventus) in 1990-91 and picked up a couple of caps for his country (he ended his career with 55 in total) \u2013 nothing extraordinary. But, a fairly unextraordinary year in European football, still enough for a vote that put Hellers on a par with Stefan Effenberg, Gheorghe Hagi and Ruud Gullit in 21st place. The third man might be the one that Shaun&apos;s friend is alluding to. Hellers and Langers were preceded more than two decades earlier by Louis Pilot, who also garnered a solitary fifth-vote in 1967 after helping Standard Liege to the Belgian Cup and then the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&apos; Cup and then repeated the feat in 1968. In 1969, though, he went one better by picking up a fourth-place vote, worth two points in the ranking system, and finishing joint 18th. But Luxembourg isn&apos;t alone in producing unlikely Ballon d&apos;Or candidates. In 1987, for example, Albania and Flamurtari Vlore striker Sokol Kushta finished level with Glenn Hoddle and Rudi Voller in 30th. It might well have been down in part at least to this stonking strike against Partizan Belgrade in the Uefa Cup. But for left-field winners, never mind nominations, it&apos;s hard to beat the 2002 Fifa presidential award, for which Sepp Blatter chose as his winner Parminder Nagra for her portrayal of Jess in Bend It Like Beckham. DELIBERATE OWN GOALS (3) Before the Christmas break we looked at a the instances in which players have scored deliberate own goals (details of which can be found here and here \u2013 the protest angle seems to have been eroded over time, but never mind). Here&apos;s Yoga Cholandha nolan: &quot;In the 1998 Tiger Cup (now the AFF Cup) match which saw Indonesia face Thailand, Indonesian defensive midfielder Mursyid Effendi (who later would be banned from football for his whole life) scored a deliberate own goal to give Thailand a 3-2 victory. &quot;The question is: why? Indonesia and Thailand had both already qualified for the semi-finals where Singapore and the hosts Vietnam awaited. Both Indonesia and Thailand wanted to avoid meeting Vietnam and that was what Indonesia and Effendi did to avoid Vietnam. Indonesia instead drew Singapore and Thailand faced Vietnam. A certain amount of justice was served in the semis, though, as Singapore defeated Indonesia and Thailand were beaten by Vietnam.&quot; The goals from the 3-2 game can be seen here:            IF YOU CAN FIND THEM, MAYBE YOU CAN HIRE \u2026 THE B-TEAM &quot;While the Sporting Lisbon B team are second in second tier, the first team is one point outside relegation zone in the top tier. What happens if unthinkable happens?&quot; wonders Daniel Story on Twitter.  We refer you to Annex Five, Article Seven, Subsections One, Four and Five of the Portuguese Competition Regulations, which state (roughly):  i) A &apos;B&apos; Team can never compete on the same competitive level of the club&apos;s main team.iv) Regardless of the classification obtained by a &apos;B&apos; Team they can never ascend to Liga I. They may, however, be relegation if their league place so determines.v) In the case of the first team of a club being relegated to Liga II, the &apos;B&apos; Team automatically descend to the division immediately below irrespective of the points obtained during the season in question.  So in the unlikely case of Sporting finishing in the bottom two in the Primera Liga, their poor B team will get booted down a division, regardless of where they finish. Any examples of this happening elsewhere? You know where to send them. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;After watching the Thierry Henry/Robert Pires penalty shambles at the weekend, I was wondering if the Johan Cruyff/Jesper Olsen incident was the only previous example of the &apos;two-man penalty&apos;?&quot; asks Lee McGleish back in the innocent days of 2005. Well, Lee, despite Monsieur Henry admitting to having taken his inspiration from the Ajax pair&apos;s famous spot-kick in 1982, there are three far earlier examples of the cheeky &quot;tap penalty&quot;. On 21 November 1964 Plymouth Argyle beat Manchester City 3-2 in a Division Two game at Home Park. The winning goal came from Mike Trebilcock \u2013 after the referee gave the Pilgrims a penalty, Johnny Newman tapped the ball sideways, enabling Trebilcock to race in and fire home. Greens on Screen has a detailed match report from the game, as well as video footage of the incident - perhaps it should be forwarded on to Highbury to show Thierry and Robert how it&apos;s done. According to the accompanying article, however, Argyle had already employed the trick once before. And some further digging reveals that Newman was involved again \u2013 on 6 February 1961 in the 5-3 League Cup fourth-round, second replay defeat to Aston Villa. This time, Wilf Carter nudged the ball for Newman to run in and crash home. Yet the nearest variation to the &quot;two-touch&quot; penalty can be tracked back even further; all the way to 5 June 1957 in fact, when Belgium entertained Iceland in a World Cup qualifying tie. Already leading 6-1, Belgium were awarded a 44th-minute penalty. Up stepped Rik Coppens to take it, but instead of firing towards Bjorgvin Hermannsson in the Iceland goal, Coppens nonchalantly passed to team-mate Andr\u00e9 Piters, who returned the favour, enabling the former to score past a stunned Hermannsson. The match ended 8-3 and Coppens went on to be voted 73rd on a list of all-time great Belgians.

Media organisations had protested against the decision, and a lawyer representing the victim&apos;s male friend \u2013 who was also injured in the attack \u2013 submitted an application for the order to be overturned, arguing &quot;the whole nation is interested in knowing the proceedings of the case&quot;. The case has caused anger and outrage in India and highlighted the problem of sexual violence towards women in the country, triggering widespread protests and continuing calls for major legal and policing reforms. Public faith in the courts is already weak and the police are widely distrusted in India. Saikat Datta, a senior Indian journalist, said the decision to hold the trial in camera was &quot;a disturbing move&quot; that would mean &quot;citizens cannot see how their justice system functions&quot;. &quot;The judiciary, like the legislature and the executive, is a key pillar that ensures the good health of a democracy. They must be seen to work and, therefore, must work in a transparent manner,&quot; Datta said. The five accused appeared in a magistrates court earlier this week and were given details of the charges against them, which include rape, murder, banditry and abduction. The men, who include a bus driver, a cleaner and a part-time gym instructor, are accused of luring the two victims on to a bus on 16 December. After being repeatedly assaulted, the pair were dumped on the roadside. The woman, who has not been named in local media, died two weeks later, on 28 December, in a Singapore hospital from internal injuries sustained during the attack. A teenager who is also accused is likely to face separate proceedings in a juvenile court, but there is growing support in India for legal changes to allow the suspect \u2013 believed to be 17 years old \u2013 to face a harsher sentence than the maximum of three years&apos; imprisonment the court could hand out. Three of the accused will plead not guilty at their forthcoming trial, their lawyer has said. Mohan Lal Sharma, an advocate, said he had been formally appointed by three of the accused as their defence lawyer. &quot;They will plead not guilty to the charges levelled against them in the charge sheet. They want to face the trial,&quot; he told the Indian Express. Police have rejected an offer by two of the defendants to become state witnesses. The case is being heard by a newly created fast-track court, set up to allow speedy justice. Legal proceedings in India, particularly for offences such as rape, often involve years, even decades, of delay. The country&apos;s chief justice, Altamas Kabir, has said the huge delays may be one reason contributing to the surge in violence towards women in recent years. Some Indian judges have tens of thousands of cases pending. A further hearing is scheduled on Thursday. Amid an unprecedented debate over cultural attitudes to women, authorities, heavily criticised for their slow response to the incident, have proposed a range of measures aiming to make the country safer for women. These range from more CCTV cameras in city centres to gender sensitisation lessons for schoolchildren. Continuing reports of other attacks on women around the country \u2013 few of which would have received much attention even a month ago \u2013 underline the scale of the problem. Official data shows one rape is reported on average every 20 minutes in India. A government panel is considering suggestions to make the death penalty mandatory for rape and introducing forms of chemical castration for the guilty. It is due to make its recommendations by 23 January."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/jan/09/india-social-entreprenuers-steady-progress", "sentences": ["Last year, it reached an agreement with the Development Bank of Singapore to fund an incubator and provide continuing financial support to its graduates."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-09T12:56:09Z", "title": "Social enterprise in India makes steady progress", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Social enterprises", "Society", "Philanthropy", "Ethical business", "Business", "Small business", "Asia Pacific", "Social enterprise"], "article": "Over the past decade the social enterprise ecosystem in India has grown steadily, almost in parallel to ours in Britain. Like ours, the evolution of the ecosystem has been uneven, with a surfeit of subsidised capital for early stage start-ups, a splattering of incubation hubs and a small but expanding number of universities that have sought to embed social enterprise in teaching, research, and enterprise activities (or all three). If London is the UK&apos;s social enterprise capital, then Mumbai is India&apos;s. The city&apos;s Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS)  launched India&apos;s first masters programme in social entrepreneurship in 2007. Last year, it reached an agreement with the Development Bank of Singapore to fund an incubator and provide continuing financial support to its graduates. In a region where incubation for social purpose ventures has expanded over the past 10 years, but where social entrepreneurship has struggled to find legitimate recognition as a field of academic study, this unique combination of the two has served to make social enterprise a viable career choice for young graduates. Unltd India \u2013 which celebrated its fifth birthday in 2012 \u2013 has been providing seed funding and business support in much the same ways as its UK counterpart has done. Until last year, it also provided a vital physical hub in the city for social entrepreneurs. Much more than a co-working space, the hub (now called Bombay Connect) is an oasis of calm, conviviality and creativity in a city that pulses to a manically financialised beat. Two of the fourth batch of graduates from the TISS masters have gone on to found successful start-ups. Ketan Parmar has launched Krishi Naturals, an organic farming business that works with farming co-operatives in the western state of Gujarat. Despite being heralded as India&apos;s most technologically advanced state (its prime minister Narendra Modi appeared as a hologram in remote villages during recent state elections), rural Gujarat is agriculturally dependent, and the state is India&apos;s largest dairy producer. In the context of an epidemic of farmer suicide \u2013 claiming one life every 12 hours \u2013 Krishi Naturals&apos; mission goes beyond environmental do-gooding. Krishi Naturals has two related objectives: to provide a sustainable livelihood for farmers and to popularise organic farming. To meet its objectives, Parmar and his team have been engaged in advancing the development of farming co-operatives, on the one hand, and consumer groups, on the other. Krishi Naturals&apos; support for farmers involves disseminating advice on best practice for organic farming methods and providing technical support. Organic farming is widely perceived as far less productive than chemical methods, so persuading farmers that organic methods can maintain crop yield and offer access to new markets is a major challenge for Krishi Naturals. On the demand side, the company is working with housing societies (co-operatives) in the city of Baroda to provide weekly baskets of fresh organic produce. This distribution model, based on seasonal subscriptions, provides farmers with a stable, predictable income and ensures that only crops that can be guaranteed to be sold will be grown, reducing food wastage. These advanced subscriptions also provide much-needed working capital. Krishi Naturals has recently partnered with Jatan, an organisation that raises awareness about organic farming and produce among farmers and consumers. Parmar believes that the organic food market in India is still in its infancy but that, &quot;domestic markets must be developed by spreading awareness about organic food. As most of the organic food produced in India is being exported, our carbon foot print in transporting this stuff is very high which ultimately affects the environment&quot;. Sampurn(e)arth, another TISS start-up and Unltd India investee, is in the business of end-to-waste management. Like Krishi Naturals, it seeks to create multiple forms of value and impact. Mumbai is home to Asia&apos;s second largest dumping ground, producing a staggering 10,000 tonnes of waste every day. Waste pickers scavenge these dumping grounds from morning to night, separating the useful from the useless. Sampurn(e)arth operates on the principle that the mass transportation of waste to these mega dumping grounds is not only hugely inefficient and expensive but also environmentally costly and responsible for perpetuating undignifying scavenging work. Its solution is to promote the segregation of waste at source and the overall decentralisation of waste management. It does this by separating dry from wet waste at sites that handle sizeable quantities \u2013 universities, corporate offices or hospitals. Where the wet waste crosses a quantity threshold, Sampurn(e)arth installs and maintains a biogas plant that transforms the waste into cooking gas and organic fertiliser. The dry waste is segregated at source and sent for recycling. This elegant decentralisation of waste management is valuable in and of itself. But Sampurn(e)arth&apos;s innovative twist lies in its partnership with Stree Mukti Sanganatha (Women&apos;s Liberation Organisation), which has given rise to a federation of female waste pickers. Sampurn(e)arth and Stree Mukti Sanganatha train members of the federation to separate dry waste properly and to manage biogas plants and composting units. Besides providing members with much-needed transferable technical skills, firms also offer a living wage, social insurance, decent working conditions and perhaps above all, a dignified livelihood. Members of the waste pickers&apos; federation glow as they speak of an ability to take pride in their work, to hold their heads high and to impress on their children the realisation of long cherished dreams of social mobility. Co-founder Debartha Banerjee describes these female waste pickers as &quot;invisible environmentalists&quot;. These high-impact, innovative solutions to market and government failures are symbols of a mounting impatience at the persistence of poverty in spite of steady, consistent growth over the past 30 years. In unequal countries such as India, where the windfall of economic gains has accrued to relatively few, social enterprise promises to empower those groups who have found themselves bypassed by globalisation&apos;s gold rush. In social enterprise circles we pay a lot of lip service to the triple bottom line, but very few organisations walk the walk like these two. The challenges lies in providing the right mix of financial, legal, moral and intellectual support for this all-important generation of change makers. Organisations such as TISS and Unltd India are at the forefront of meeting this challenge. Dr Pathik Pathak is a lecturer in sociology and social policy and director of undergraduate programmes at the University of Southampton.

Button, 33 next week, is 10 years older than P\u00e9rez and has driven in 228 races (against the Mexican&apos;s 37). He was the world champion in 2009 and runner-up in 2011. The new season, which starts in Australia in two months, will be his fourth with the Woking-based team. But, showing all the self-belief that won him three podium finishes last year (he almost won twice), P\u00e9rez turned up for his first day of work at the McLaren Technology Centre on Wednesday and said: &quot;I will be disappointed if I don&apos;t beat him. I am here to win. We are all here to win. &quot;If you don&apos;t expect to win you should go home. I am here to win the championship. That is the target.&quot; That will come as a surprise to Button, whose profile at McLaren changed once his former team-mate Lewis Hamilton decided to quit the team and sign for Mercedes last year. McLaren will treat both drivers equally, which is their policy. But most people, including Button, clearly believe the British driver&apos;s extra experience will give him the edge over a man who only made his F1 debut in Australia in 2011. After P\u00e9rez signed for McLaren, following last year&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix, Button said: &quot;Sergio is inexperienced compared with Lewis and it will be his first year, but he will still be quick. But I will definitely be the person McLaren turn to if they want a world champion next year.&quot; P\u00e9rez finished 10th in last year&apos;s championship with 66 points. But his form fell away dramatically after he had put pen to paper with McLaren and he failed to pick up a single point in the final six races of the season. The first man any Formula One driver wants to beat is his own team-mate and P\u00e9rez&apos;s confidence will give added piquancy to the opening race in Mebourne on 17 March. It was there, two years ago, that P\u00e9rez made an eye-catching debut, preserving his tyres with great skill to finish seventh, though his Sauber car was later disqualified on a technical issue. P\u00e9rez added: &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to working with Jenson \u2013 to learn from him. He&apos;s a great champion. The most experienced driver in the paddock now. So I think I have a lot to learn from him. And obviously I want to beat him as well. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to success with this team. I am quite surprised about how warm and together the team is. From the outside it looks as if it might be a very cold team \u2013 very strict and very cold \u2013 but when I came here I was surprised at what a great family it is. And if they choose me it&apos;s because they saw I can deliver what we all want here. To win the world championship. I have to respond to the trust they put in me.&quot; P\u00e9rez, who flew in from Mexico on Wednesday morning will have the added pressure of replacing Hamilton, not only the sport&apos;s fastest driver but also someone who has been its greatest box office attraction in recent years. &quot;I fully respect Lewis,&quot; P\u00e9rez said. &quot; I think he&apos;s a great driver. Not only that but a very special personality. He&apos;s great. I&apos;m not here to compare myself to him. &quot;What he achieved here is incredible \u2013 he is the last world champion the team has so he has a lot of respect here. And I wish him all the best at his new team but there&apos;s no point comparing myself to him.&quot; Nor does P\u00e9rez like comparing himself with a pay driver \u2013 even though that is how he was described after joining Sauber clutching a bag of Mexican gold \u2013 his sponsor Carlos Slim is believed to be the world&apos;s richest man.But P\u00e9rez said: &quot;It made me angry at the beginning as people didn&apos;t realise what I had sacrificed. I had to leave my family when I was 15 and live above a restaurant in Germany. But sooner or later you learn how to deal with it. &quot;I think I showed from my very first race in Formula One that I was not a pay driver.

Go east", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Procurement", "Professional development", "Joining the public sector"], "article": "Anyone with decent expertise and ambition in procurement should seriously consider obtaining work in the Middle East or south-east Asia. My overwhelming impression gained in 2012 about south-east Asia, the Middle East and, to a degree, South Africa, is the massive investment in infrastructure in those regions. These countries have a tremendous can-do attitude in these countries, with a clear intention in many of them to attract business, such as financial and IT sectors, away from the developed western world. While the UK seems bogged down in deciding whether or not to build a third runway at Heathrow, Dubai airport has quadrupled its number of passengers in 10 years. In November 2012, the prime minister for the United Arab Emirates announced that, just three years after the world fiscal crisis had hit the state-owned Dubai World conglomerate, a new city will be built, with a park one-third as big again as Hyde Park and with the biggest shopping mall in the world. The country&apos;s total infrastructure spend is 17.5% of its GDP. Despite recent increases, the total UK spend on transport infrastructure is less than \u00a310bn a year, ie under 1% of our GDP. In contrast, Singapore spent nearly \u00a33bn in 2012 on transport infrastructure, one-third of that of the UK, even though it covers an area only 0.25% the size of the UK, while its population of just over five million is only 8% the size of the UK. Singapore also plans to invest \u00a330bn to double the reach and capacity of its metrorail network over the next few years from its capacity in 2008. In 2012, government IT spending increased to \u00a30.6bn. Two-thirds of the value of Singapore&apos;s procurement for its IT network is going to local businesses. Based on population, it could be argued that to keep up with Singapore, the UK&apos;s capital spend on transport should be \u00a336bn a year, and on IT infrastructure \u00a37bn. The difference between the two countries was underlined in UK chancellor George Osborne&apos;s autumn statement in December 2012. Theadditional infrastructure spend announced by Osbornewill do little more than slightly reduce the speed at which the gap between parts of Asia and the UK is growing. For example, many people may be surprised that there is just one decent main road across the Pennines south of Cumbria and no plans to change this. There are no proper direct road links from the industrial east Lancashire councils to the nearby metropolitan areas of Leeds and Bradford, nor between Sheffield and Manchester \u2013 just 40 miles apart. If this were Dubai, we would have six-lane highways. The ambitions of the Asian and Middle Eastern countries far exceed those even of Michael Heseltine. The UK seems to be on a course of managed decline. The implications for UK procurement personnel are immense. Procurement expert Peter Smith says procurement employment in the UK may have peaked. I agree \u2013 but would go much further. As public sector procurement in the UK becomes more integrated, there will be a shakeout out of procurement posts \u2013 in particular, a huge reduction in the number of heads of procurement. This is in addition to what appears to be a trend for multi-national companies to move their procurement operations to south-east Asia. And there is no income tax in Dubai. Procurement experts looking to work in this part of the world will get great experience of project contracting work, demandfor which are likely to continue to increase.

Manohar Lal Sharma, who represents three of the six men arrested two days after the incident, told the Guardian that all those on trial for the attack were &quot;brutally assaulted&quot; by police during interrogations. Five men aged between 19 and 35 face a potential death sentence for their alleged roles in the attack on 16 December, which led to widespread outrage and provoked massive protests across India. &quot;They were beaten most brutally. They were forced to drink urine and from the toilet. They were sexually assaulted with sticks in their backside. Whatever statements they made were made under duress and are worthless,&quot; Sharma said. A Delhi police spokesperson said he had no comment on the allegations. Indian police face frequent accusations of abusing detainees and have been repeatedly criticised by campaign groups for systematically resorting to violence during interrogations. &quot;Torture in custody is so widespread that this is what defence lawyers always say. Their claims are taken seriously because it is almost routine that detainees are subject to beating or worse,&quot; said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch. Though there will be little sympathy for the claims of brutality in India, the accusation is likely to further raise concerns abroad over the conduct of their trial. Local legal experts have already pointed out that the accused did not have legal representation during their police interrogations. Under Indian law only statements made before a magistrate can be admitted as evidence in a trial. There are fears that the massive public pressure to secure rapid convictions and hangings could lead to procedural short-cuts. &quot;The worry is this becomes a search for the quickest way to hang these guys. A trial is a performance for the public in which the state shows that it can protect its citizens. But, especially in a case so egregious and so brutal it is very important to have a fair trial,&quot; said Maneka Guruswamy, a supreme court lawyer in Delhi. However, Guruswamy said that with the victim&apos;s friend who was with her throughout the attack available as a witness, as well as DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime and a statement taken from the victim before she died, there was less incentive for police in this case to use violence to extract confessions. The trial, held in a new fast-track court set up to deal with rape and related offences, is being held behind closed doors after chaotic scenes in an earlier hearing. A 17-year-old boy will be tried separately in a juvenile court. The accused, who include a bus driver, a cleaner and a part-time gym instructor, are accused of luring the woman and her male friend on to a bus at 9pm. The pair were returning from watching a film. After being repeatedly assaulted, they were dumped on a roadside. The woman, who has not been named in local media, died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital from internal injuries. She had been repeatedly assaulted with an iron bar. Sharma, the lawyer, said he had met his three clients in Delhi&apos;s Tihar high-security jail on Wednesday. &quot;They will plead not guilty. They are innocent. They are mourning,&quot; he said. Two of the defendants are reported to have said they want to be state witnesses. Police said they would not accept the request, according to local media. New details have also emerged about the 17-year-old defendant. Official documents describe an illiterate teenager who dropped out of school aged 12, ran away from home and then spent five years shifting between menial temporary jobs in Delhi, in hotels and a dairy, before being befriended by Ram Singh, the alleged ringleader of the accused, while working at a roadside restaurant. The teenager, the oldest of five children, has said he had travelled to the slum where Singh lived with his brother, also among the accused, on the day before the attack to give him some money, the Guardian has learned. He stayed the night and cooked chicken for the Singh brothers during a drinking session the next afternoon. According to official documents he told a magistrate who took his statement after his arrest that he had &quot;gone mad for a moment&quot; and was &quot;very sorry&quot;. Amid an unprecedented debate over cultural attitudes to women, Indian authorities have responded to criticism by proposing a range of measures to improve safety, including more CCTV cameras in city centres and &quot;gender sensitisation&quot; lessons for schoolchildren. Continuing reports of other attacks on women around the country \u2014 few of which would have received much attention a month ago \u2014 underline the scale of the problem.

Some economists foresee a full-blown triple-dip recession, and with consumer spending and domestic investment remaining sluggish and more public spending cuts just round the corner, even minimal economic growth will be highly dependent on an increase in British exports. Despite the doom and gloom, one sector continues to provide a small glimmer of hope: the British car industry. Rapid growth in output and productivity is bucking the wider trend of relative economic decline and restoring the UK&apos;s position as a global manufacturing hub. This resurgence has been driven by a range of factors, but especially important has been an increase in foreign investment, international trade and innovation. In each of these areas, Britain&apos;s membership of the EU remains crucial. Over the past two years, the British automotive industry received nearly \u00a36bn of foreign investment. Just as with the Japanese companies hailed with rescuing the British car industry in the 1980s, this investment has been primarily motivated by the UK&apos;s position as a launchpad into the highly regulated EU market. And while domestic demand has grown in the past year, 80% of all vehicles produced in the UK are still sold overseas, over half of them in the EU. If the UK were to leave the single market British-produced vehicles would face import tariffs from 10% to 22%, as well as numerous regulatory barriers. Major foreign investors such as Nissan, Ford and BMW would rapidly look elsewhere, probably to more secure EU members such as Poland or the Czech Republic. Even if the British government was able to renegotiate a unilateral free trade deal with the EU, it would be unlikely to enjoy unrestricted access to the single market and the accompanying uncertainty would make any would-be investors think twice. Admittedly, the EU market has seen a dramatic decline since the eurozone crisis. This makes it essential to expand exports into emerging markets through free trade deals. The EU-South Korea trade agreement, signed last year, has helped bring about an 8% increase in vehicle exports from the UK. The recent trade agreement with Singapore should also give a major boost to British car exports. Yet this will be small change compared to the breathtaking potential of EU free trade negotiations with Japan and the US, due to be launched in the coming months. While it could negatively impact the EU car industry as a whole, a deal with Japan could help boost investment in the UK and decrease the input costs of British-manufactured Japanese cars. The US on the other hand is the UK&apos;s largest export market, and currently far more British vehicles are exported to the US than vice versa. However, without the economic weight of the EU, it is unlikely the UK would be able to gain any favourable concessions in the politically sensitive American automotive sector. Finally, EU carbon emission targets and specific incentives to produce low-emission cars have helped spur innovation in the UK automotive sector. The European Commission has also invested billions of euros in research and development funding, encouraging cross-border research projects and ensuring that Europe remains a world leader in developing smarter and greener technologies. The importance of this can be seen in the UK, where soaring petrol prices have encouraged consumers to switch to more fuel-efficient cars. Meanwhile sales of electric cars have more than doubled and are expected to increase further as new models become available \u2013 notably the Nissan Euro Leaf, which will start production in Sunderland next year. Outside of the EU, the UK would soon lose its competitive edge in the global transition towards more innovative, low-carbon vehicles. Britain&apos;s car industry is a vital part of its economy, supporting 730,000 jobs and accounting for 11% of manufactured exports. It also plays a crucial role in offsetting the UK&apos;s huge trade deficit; this year Britain sold more cars abroad than it imported, for the first time since 1976. And thanks to the presence of factories and supply chains throughout all UK regions, it&apos;s an industry that helps to balance the growing north-south divide. As a group of senior business leaders recently warned Cameron in the build-up to his much anticipated Europe speech, casting doubts over Britain&apos;s EU membership at this time risks creating a climate of &quot;damaging uncertainty&quot;. Such uncertainty would be especially harmful for Britain&apos;s thriving car industry, and thus for the British economy as a whole."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/jan/15/academic-jobs-east-asia-universities", "sentences": ["As the world&apos;s power base shifts from the US to China, universities in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore are expanding to meet an increased demand for higher education as governments in the region push hard to expand the percentage of their populations who have higher qualifications.", "Currently only 18% of Hong Kongers and 26% of Singaporeans go to university.", "The Singaporean Ministry of Education wants to increase the proportion of its young people studying at degree level to 30% by 2015, and it has recently opened four new publicly funded universities to achieve this.", "Tzu-Bin Lin is originally from Taiwan but he lived in the UK for seven years before taking up his current post as assistant professor in education policy and leadership studies at the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.", "&quot;For me,&quot; he says, &quot;Singapore is one of the ideal places to work.", "Higher education is generously funded here, and if you perform well you are rewarded well.&quot; Two of Singapore&apos;s publicly funded universities \u2013 The National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University \u2013 are ranked in the world top 50.", "The National University of Singapore (NUS) is 25th in the chart.", "&quot;There is a large pool of outstanding academics in the US and Europe, so these regions are important sources of faculty for NUS.&quot; Just a short hop by plane from Singapore, Hong Kong universities are taking the radical step this year of lengthening their degree courses from three years to four in a bid by the government to make university more accessible."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-15T10:15:00Z", "title": "New year, new academic job: education opportunities in the far east", "tags": ["International", "Higher Education Network", "Academics", "Professional development", "Recruitment and HR", "Higher education", "Education", "University administration", "Lecturers"], "article": "The booming higher education sector in south-east Asia and Hong Kong means there are plentiful job opportunities for adventurous academics from Europe and America. As the world&apos;s power base shifts from the US to China, universities in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore are expanding to meet an increased demand for higher education as governments in the region push hard to expand the percentage of their populations who have higher qualifications. Currently only 18% of Hong Kongers and 26% of Singaporeans go to university. This is in stark contrast to the figures for Europe where, for example, 63% of Finnish school leavers go to university, as do 50% of Polish and 47% of Britons. All of which means universities in the region cannot yet fill all the new academic posts from staff native to the region, and so are having to recruit from overseas. The Singaporean Ministry of Education wants to increase the proportion of its young people studying at degree level to 30% by 2015, and it has recently opened four new publicly funded universities to achieve this. It also runs a recruitment programme to attract foreign talent. Tzu-Bin Lin is originally from Taiwan but he lived in the UK for seven years before taking up his current post as assistant professor in education policy and leadership studies at the National Institute of Education at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. He says roughly half the staff at his university are foreign. He says he is earning around the same wage as when he taught at a UK university but he has free accommodation on campus, and taxes and living costs are lower. &quot;For me,&quot; he says, &quot;Singapore is one of the ideal places to work.

The National University of Singapore (NUS) is 25th in the chart. Its president, professor Tan Chorh Chuan, says the focus of his university is on quality, which inevitably means recruiting internationally. NUS has faculty and students from more than 100 countries. &quot;There is a large pool of outstanding academics in the US and Europe, so these regions are important sources of faculty for NUS.&quot; Just a short hop by plane from Singapore, Hong Kong universities are taking the radical step this year of lengthening their degree courses from three years to four in a bid by the government to make university more accessible. Its school leavers will now study a wide variety of subjects in their first year before specialising in their second. Professor Arthur Ellis was recruited by the City University in Hong Kong two years ago to be their provost and help them prepare for the switch and says: &quot;now is a particularly exciting time to be in Hong Kong. The opportunities are extraordinary because of the kind of investments being made in education here.&quot; Ellis thinks the transition from three-year courses to four-year courses is a &quot;major stress test&quot; for the Hong Kong education system. He says City University knows that it needs &quot;significantly more staff&quot; to teach the longer courses, and that the institution would find it &quot;very difficult to fill all the posts from local staff.&quot; Following the recent radical expansion, he adds, &quot;it has been a challenge to get the academic staffing we need for these student\u00a0numbers.&quot; Professor Kar-Yan Tam is associate provost and dean of students at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). He says his university is actively &quot;seeking to foster a highly international, diversified outlook&quot;. He says HKUST is building partnerships with faculties across Europe, the US, Canada, South Korea and mainland China.Tam thinks foreign staff are attracted to working in Hong Kong because it is &quot;an international city with strong East-West elements and a strategic gateway to China and the region as a whole&quot;. Hong Kong has an excellent reputation for its existing higher education provision. Of its eight publicly funded universities, two are in the QS university rankings world top 50, and four are in the top 200. Most prestigious among them are the University of Hong Kong, ranked 23rd, and HKUST, ranked 33rd. HKUST is also ranked first in the Asian university rankings. Malaysia is the regional trendsetter, having set out its stall as early as the mid-90s. In 1995 the Malaysian government, faced with the fact that 20% of its students left the country and went abroad to study at huge cost to Malaysian families and the Malaysian economy, decided to put all its efforts into reversing this trend.  Since then they have set about building up their network of universities in a bid to keep Malay students at home and attract foreign students into the country. In 2009 alone Malaysia increased its intake of foreign students by 26%, taking in 69,154 international students. By 2011 that had increased to more than 93,000. The target is to reach 150,000 by 2015. Living in south-east Asia and Hong Kong today means witnessing first hand the rise of China and the coming of the new world order \u2013 and for some that&apos;s more of an incentive than any enhancement to pay and conditions.

Universal Music, which along with a number of other suppliers has provided a total of perhaps more than \u00a340m to prop up HMV&apos;s beleaguered business, is also understood to liable for the rent on 16 of the DVD and music retailer&apos;s UK stores, which number about 240. The music company took on the rental liability \u2013 which is understood to cover 14 UK stores and two in the US \u2013 as part of its \u00a31.2bn acquisition of EMI Music last year. EMI guaranteed rental agreements on a number of HMV stores when the retailer was spun-off from the record label in 1998. Universal assumed these guarantees when it acquired EMI. Universal Music will be liable for the rental bill on the 16 properties if HMV&apos;s administrators Deloitte, appointed on Monday, fail to find a buyer and the stores are not re-let. &quot;We are working with HMV and the administrators during these difficult times,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Universal Music. In 2011, Hilco UK, the British-based restructuring specialist, paid $3.2m (\u00a31.98m) to save the 121-strong HMV Canada chain. It is not known exactly how much Universal Music&apos;s potential bill might be. One music industry source said that a \u00a3150m figure covering 40 stores which was reported last year is wholly inaccurate. Universal was one of a number of suppliers \u2013 including Warner Bros, Sony Music, Disney and Universal Pictures \u2013 that struck a deal last January to prop up HMV. HMV handed the suppliers a equity stake of up to 5% in the form of warrants. In return the suppliers provided greater access to their music, TV and film back catalogues and offered HMV stock on consignment, meaning the retailer only paid for products if it sold them. In August, HMV reported its financial results for the year to 28 April and revealed that the strategic alliance with suppliers had benefited its bottom line to the tune of \u00a315m. HMV owns a total of 247 stores. There are 230 in the UK &amp; Ireland and a further eight internationally, six in Hong Kong and two in Singapore. The retailer also wholly owns another nine stores which carry the Fopp brand, the independent retailer that was acquired by HMV after it went into administration in 2007. HMV employs about 4,550 staff. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

I had lived in New York and I like big cites. My partner at the time was Portuguese, but grew up in the Cape Verde islands, and for most of her youth she travelled between Boston and Lisbon. So Hong Kong seemed like neutral terrain \u2013 neither of us had lived in Asia. And then of course, it is hard to beat a 16% maximum tax rate. That sounded very attractive coming from Belgium. &quot;Most of my time is spent on research. I teach about 6 hours per week \u2013 this is the typical academic teaching load \u2013 mostly to graduate students. The timing of the move wasn&apos;t great for me. In the three months around the move, I had to defend my doctoral work, and I lost my father unexpectedly to cancer. Then I became a father, and I also somehow had to prepare for the nine hours of teaching per week as it was then. It was brutal, but I&apos;ve never looked back. &quot;I think academics in south-east Asia work harder, for longer hours, and we are further away from the action. But on the other hand, Hong Kong changes so rapidly that it feels like every other year I am in another city. Plus the pay is not bad. Asian universities pay comparably (pre-tax) to US universities and better than European universities. &quot;Both Hong Kong and Singapore are seen as transitory places. Ideal for getting your career on track (research funding is pretty generous here) and then moving on from. But quite a lot of us seem to stay here. I was planning to stay for three years, and now I have stayed for 10, and I just bought a house. &quot;Academics in the UK/Europe/America who are thinking of making the move need to keep an open mind. Western universities typically have a horizontal organisational structure. At Asian universities the structure is much more hierarchical. Contracts and promises are less strictly followed than we are used to in the west \u2013 although I am being treated really well. &quot;Give yourself time to adapt to the local ways of doing things. Asian students are more reserved and I did need to adapt my teaching to take this into account. We are evaluated by the students for every course we teach. The first semester I taught, I had not bothered to take the time to understand the students&apos; background or needs. As a result my teaching evaluations were far below average. I was politely but strongly advised to explore and attend the various teaching seminars that were being offered by the university. I did go to some of these, but mostly I tried to interact with the students in order to understand their aspirations, doubts, etc. Five years later I was awarded the university&apos;s teaching award. There are almost weekly seminars specifically targeting our teaching personnel. The support with regard to teaching is far better than in Europe. &quot;In our college about half our students go on exchange to destinations in the UK, Europe, Australia, US and Canada. And their places are filled by the western students. The western students are more vocal in class and they seem at first sight more creative. But Asian students often perform better on tests and are on average better in group work.&quot;Tom Vinaimont is assistant professor in the department of economics and finance at the City University of Hong Kong This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Was this place you envisioned south-east Asia? South-east Asia is the land of plenty \u2013 for those academics wanting to test the waters of higher education overseas. As governments in the region push for more people to attain higher qualifications, universities in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore are expanding to meet this increased demand for tertiary education. And with that demand come job vacancies, as leading universities in the region recruit academic and administrative staff from overseas to keep up. At the same time, Western universities are becoming global institutions, with many UK institutions investing money in building campuses abroad. One such project, NUMed Malaysia, a campus run by Newcastle University in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, is currently offering 18-month to three-year teaching stints. A bonus for the academic looking for a strategic getaway in a fast developing country. But with so many institutions branching out overseas, how can academics make the move \u2013 and what is university working life actually like in south-east Asia? There are many practicalities to consider before filing that job application, from relocation allowances to accomodation options. Then there&apos;s the different pedagogic and bureaucratic approaches: &quot;Give yourself time to adapt to the local ways of doing things,&quot; says Tom Vinaimont, assistant professor in the department of economics and finance at the City University of Hong Kong who has lived and worked in Asia for the past 10 years. &quot;Western universities typically have a horizontal organisational structure. At Asian universities the structure is much more hierarchical.&quot; According to Vinaimont, the perks are worth it: a 16% maximum tax rate, lots of time allocated to generously funded research, higher salaries at Asian universities than their European counterparts, and the chance to live in a city that&apos;s constantly changing. These were just some of the sells for him \u2013 now we want to hear your thoughts, experience and advice. Our panel of professionals will be discussing both the benefits and challenges of relocating and working in south-east Asia on Wednesday 16 January from 12-2pm GMT.

But enthusiasm over the Dreamliner&apos;s pivotal role in a new age of fuel-efficient commercial aviation has been replaced with mounting concern over its safety and the prospect of further production delays after the aircraft was hit by several worrying incidents in less than a fortnight. Hours after an ANA Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing on Wednesday morning when a cockpit smoke alarm went off during a domestic flight, the airline and its rival Japan Airlines grounded their entire combined fleet of 24 Dreamliners \u2013 about half the global total in service \u2013 to undergo emergency checks. The incident occurred soon after takeoff on a flight between Yamaguchi in western Japan and Tokyo. It is the latest in a spate of problems involving JAL and ANA-operated Dreamliners in Japan and the US since the start of the year. They include an electrical fire, two fuel leaks, a brake computer malfunction and a cracked cockpit window. &quot;Looking at this from the point of view of the average citizen, having these sort of incidents occur seemingly day after day, one could become very uneasy,&quot; Akihiro Ota, the transport minister, told reporters. &quot;We plan to look into the scale of these accidents and what the overall situation is. We will convey the message to those who operate the plane that it is absolutely necessary to be safe.&quot; By Wednesday, the pressure to ground the fleet had become irresistible, with Japan&apos;s transport ministry describing the emergency landing as a &quot;major incident&quot; that could have led to an accident. The ministry had already launched an investigation after two incidents involving Dreamliners belonging to Japanese airlines last week. &quot;Given the fuel leakage incidents occurred in succession, the minister directed the aviation director of the Regional Civil Aviation Bureau to open an investigation and find the causes of the two leaks as soon as possible,&quot; it said in a statement. Japanese authorities said they would work with Boeing and US aviation authorities, which launched their own comprehensive review of the aircraft on Friday. The US Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said they were monitoring Wednesday&apos;s incident. There have been suggestions \u2013 vigorously denied by Boeing \u2013 that the rush to get the first batch of aircraft off the production line and into service may have contributed to the recent problems. The incidents could cause further delays if the investigations lead to demands for design and other changes in the hundreds of Dreamliners yet to be built. To date, Boeing has received orders for more than 800 of the aircraft from airlines around the world. The possibility of serous design or technological flaws will hit Japan particularly hard. It has been a vocal champion of the plane&apos;s fuel economy, and manufactures about a third of its parts, including its batteries and wings. ANA was heavily involved in the $207m aircraft&apos;s design and is, to date, its biggest customer. ANA flies 17 Dreamliners and has 49 more on order; JAL has seven in operation, with another 38 to come. British Airways has 24 on order and Virgin Atlantic 16. Aviation analysts were divided over the seriousness of the recent incidents. &quot;It is not abnormal for new aircraft to have some teething problems,&quot; Chris de Lavigne, of Frost and Sullivan in Singapore, told the BBC. &quot;There were initial issues with the Airbus A380 as well. Look where it is today. It is flying successfully and everyone seems to be happy with it.&quot; But Richard Aboulafia, a senior analyst with the Teal Group in the US, said: &quot;I think you&apos;re nearing the tipping point where they need to regard this as a serious crisis. This is going to change people&apos;s perception of the aircraft if they don&apos;t act quickly.&quot; The recent fuel leaks and electrical fire occurred while the aircraft were on the ground, and on Wednesday morning, all 129 passengers and eight crew left the plane safely after it landed at Takamatsu airport about 40 minutes after taking off. US aviation officials insist that despite the glitches, the aircraft is safe to fly. But footage of the plane on the tarmac, its inflatable emergency chutes deployed, will have done little to reassure an increasingly nervous flying public. &quot;Particularly worrisome is the fact that problems have arisen with electrical systems, which the 787 is more reliant on compared with conventional aircraft,&quot; Kazuki Sugiura, an aviation analyst, told Kyodo. ANA said its fleet of 17 Dreamliners could be back in the air as soon as Thursday, depending on the outcome of safety checks. The firm&apos;s vice-president, Osamu Shinobe, bowed deeply in apology at a press conference, and confirmed that the battery thought to be behind Wednesday&apos;s incident was of the same type involved in an electrical fire aboard a JAL Dreamliner at Boston&apos;s Logan airport last week. &quot;There was a battery alert in the cockpit and there was an odd smell detected in the cockpit and cabin, and [the pilot] decided to make an emergency landing,&quot; Shinobe said. JAL spokesman Seiji Takaramoto said the firm had cancelled all five scheduled 787 flights on Wednesday. &quot;We will decide what to do after today based on what ANA finds out about the cause of the problem with their aircraft,&quot; he said. Boeing said it was aware of the emergency landing. &quot;We will be working with our customer and the appropriate regulatory agencies,&quot; said Marc Birtel, a Boeing spokesman. The recent scares have so far had no impact on future orders, and neither have they led to groundings by other airlines. The Australian carrier Qantas said its order for 15 Dreamliners remained unchanged, while Air India said it would talk to parts makers but had no plans to take its six existing Dreamliners out of service. Boeing has said it expects to at least break even on the 1,100 new Dreamliners it expects to deliver over the next decade. But some analysts have predicted that the aircraft&apos;s huge development costs mean the company will never make any money from it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/jan/16/singapore-universities-academic-jobs-life", "sentences": ["Professor Martyn Partridge has been in Singapore for two years as senior vice-dean at Nanyang Technological University&apos;s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, a joint partnership with Imperial College London.", "&quot;Singapore is a wonderful place to work, with excited, interested and well-trained colleagues.", "As we are older, more of our spare time is spent with Singaporean friends we&apos;ve met through work.", "&quot;I&apos;ve been visiting Singapore for more than 20 years and I&apos;ve witnessed its transformation in that time.", "&quot;The only comfort that is missing in Singapore is easy access to BBC iPlayer \u2013 and wine is too expensive."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-16T10:41:14Z", "title": "Singapore: 'a wonderful place to work'", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Recruitment and HR", "Higher education", "Education", "Lecturers"], "article": "Professor Martyn Partridge has been in Singapore for two years as senior vice-dean at Nanyang Technological University&apos;s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, a joint partnership with Imperial College London. &quot;Helping to start and shape a medical school is the biggest, most challenging thing I&apos;ve ever done,&quot; he says. &quot;Singapore is a wonderful place to work, with excited, interested and well-trained colleagues. It&apos;s a safe environment with a strong emphasis on education and science. There are inevitably differences in leadership styles and school structure \u2013 but these don&apos;t matter when institutions share the same values. &quot;Relocation inevitably disrupts some professional and family connections but modern ways of communicating are so good that it&apos;s as easy to supervise PhD students from overseas as it is to talk to my grandchildren. My children have flown the nest \u2013 two out of three are temporarily in Australia, which makes visits a short haul while we&apos;re here. You need to think through implications on family, pension, children&apos;s education and the expense of maintaining more than one base. If you relocate when you have young children you inevitably make friends at the school gate, probably among the expat community.

There&apos;s a world of difference between visiting a country and living here \u2013 but I can honestly say my affection for the country, its people and culture has grown. A warm climate is always attractive to anybody from northern Europe \u2013 but the common British moan about the weather isn&apos;t relevant \u2013 &quot;nice day&quot; seems superfluous when it&apos;s always warm. &quot;The only comfort that is missing in Singapore is easy access to BBC iPlayer \u2013 and wine is too expensive. But that should be offset against my favourite walk: through Labrador Park and around Keppel Harbour. Of course the restaurants are superb. Most food is imported so eating out varies from international prices to incredibly good food at very low prices.

In Malaysia and Singapore, more than 45,000 students are currently enrolled on UK university courses; in Hong Kong, more than 20,000. UK universities are truly global institutions, says Professor Reg Jordan of Newcastle University \u2013 and they are rapidly expanding their reach. &quot;Students gain a great deal of life experience, new friends, and greater understanding of cultural differences and new ways of studying and working,&quot; says professor John Chapman of Glasgow University. Staff follow new lines of research and cement bonds with new colleagues. Some students attend purpose-built campuses, taught by home-grown or international academics; some are taught in local colleges by UK academics on flying visits; some take degrees franchised from the UK but taught by locals; and some staff and students participate in exchanges. Branching out Branch campuses teach UK degree programmes in international locations, explains Professor Andy Walker of Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh. In Malaysian administrative capital Putrajaya, Heriot-Watt is opening a new campus to teach science, engineering, business, mathematics and design to 4,000 students from 2014. Quality (exam moderation and the syllabus) is assured by the mothership in Scotland, while staff for Heriot-Watt Malaysia are internationally recruited. Whereas Malaysian universities are licensed by the ministry of education, UK universities are self-determining not-for-profit entities. The ministry limits which courses universities can offer, though not their content. &quot;Quality is our hallmark,&quot; stresses Reg Jordan, &quot;but you can&apos;t come in here like some neo-imperialist. You have to understand what the host wants: moving their population up the knowledge chain. They need a lot more doctors, for instance.&quot; Newcastle is building a flagship campus in EduCity, Johor Bahru on the southern tip of Malaysia, an ambitious project encouraged by the Malaysian government. Pre-medical students are already taking Newcastle&apos;s degree; they will soon be joined by engineering students from the University Southampton as well as those studying education, English language and business from the University of Reading. Newcastle academics are seconded to Malaysia for 18 months to three years, with visitors flying out for a month&apos;s teaching. &quot;It&apos;s not for everyone,&quot; stresses Jordan, but opportunities for career development and research attract Newcastle staff to stints teaching abroad. However, most staff are locally recruited. Newcastle is following the market. &quot;If we sit here in the UK waiting for students to come to us, it will all dry up,&quot; says Jordan. Nottingham, which calls itself a &quot;truly global university&quot;, has had a Malaysian campus in Kuala Lumpur since 2000. Likewise, Liverpool&apos;s ambitious collaboration with Xi&apos;an Jiaotong in Suzhou is the largest international collaborative university of its kind in China and one of the largest branch campuses in the world. However, the UK still draws students, both on the popular exchange programmes, and directly \u2013 Oxford Brookes, for instance, has more than 4,000 Singaporean students. Students taking Birmingham&apos;s MBA in Singapore can take a year in England; third-year students in Malaysia&apos;s International Medical University may transfer to Glasgow; while hundreds of students from Hong Kong finish their degrees at\u00a0Middlesex. More commonly, says Andr\u00e9a Edwards, director of international development and mobility at the University of Birmingham, UK academics work as a &quot;flying faculty&quot;, teaching students in Singapore, Malaysian and Hong Kong institutions in intensive blocks of two weeks. Lancaster University&apos;s small but respected MA in Teaching English as a Second Language (Tesol) works similarly, appealing alike to UK academics and Hong Kong students, who work full-time along with study. Far-flung campuses But the fastest growing model offers UK degrees taught locally, with exams and syllabuses moderated from the UK. Thousands of students take Heriot-Watt degrees in local institutions in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. Glasgow&apos;s John Chapman adds: &quot;By next year, we will have 15 staff based in Singapore and a total of 600 students on our programmes there. All these students have the option to spend four weeks in summer in Glasgow.&quot; Students develop into loyal alumni. University of Kent alumni in Hong Kong have been building exchanges with Hong Kong universities in politics, international relations and business since 1966. Links have expanded into joint four-year business degrees and double master&apos;s degrees, where students attend both universities and get two degrees. Such arrangements benefit the UK in more than income. Links with other universities continue to proliferate \u2013 professor Roger Vickerman of Ken, for instance, is now researching across several Hong Kong universities. &quot;Education is an important feed into industry generally,&quot; he says. &quot;The more we can get British students to learn in other environments the better.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Kate Hoey, MP for Vauxhall where the accident occurred, said there should be a &quot;real inquiry&quot; into the increased use of helicopters at a time when London was experiencing a boom in skyscraper construction. The stretch of the Thames in the immediate vicinity is seeing some of the biggest changes to the London skyline, with the tower whose crane was struck by the Agusta 109 set to be the tallest residential building in Britain. Most residents&apos; concern has been about helicopter noise. Battersea heliport, the main London base, limits the number of private flights on a normal day to around 80, although exemptions can double this, and government and emergency services flights are not capped. Wandsworth council advertises a complaints line for residents and says the helicopter base has an &quot;adverse effect&quot; on the environment in terms of noise and air quality. Hoey said: &quot;We will need a real inquiry into the increasing use of helicopters flying into London coupled with the large number of new tall buildings.&quot; She added: &quot;Maybe we&apos;ve come to take it for granted that people have the right to take helicopters over London and I think we may have to look at that. &quot;Something terribly wrong happened today but that doesn&apos;t mean we shouldn&apos;t look into the wider issues.&quot; However, experts cautioned against knee-jerk reactions. James Healy-Pratt, head of aviation at Stewarts Law and a licensed turbine helicopter pilot, said: &quot;Civil aviation is very safe. That includes twin-engine helicopters. These are \u00a32-3m machines that are flown by professional pilots who can easily cope with a changing skyline.&quot; Last year an early-day motion sponsored by four Lib Dem and Labour MPs noted &quot;with concern the large number of non-essential helicopter flights over London&quot; and that &quot;lack of regulation in this field means that there is no limit on night-time flying and that sufficient safety precautions are not in place for the landing sites&quot;. It called on the government to introduce regulation to ensure all helicopter flights were registered with a central agency and to disincentivise the use of private helicopters in urban areas. The Shard is the most notable of the latest skyscrapers along the Thames, with its summit at 310 metres (1,016ft). More than a dozen more are under construction or approved for construction in the next six years that will rise over 150 metres (500ft), doubling the number of such buildings on the central London skyline. The Battersea redevelopment will see a collection of towers springing up around the Nine Elms area, where developers have put apartments on sale for prices ranging from \u00a31m to \u00a350m. The most expensive property will be located at the top of the 50-storey building in Wednesday&apos;s crash, The Tower, One St George Wharf, a triplex penthouse. The area&apos;s redevelopment has been prompted in part by the relocation of the American embassy, scheduled to open in 2017. Plans recently confirmed by the chancellor for an extension of London Underground&apos;s Northern line to Battersea have underpinned property developers&apos; plans. Altogether 20,000 new homes are to be built on 195 hectares around Nine Elms. Around 600 flats to be constructed in the converted Battersea power station sold out in four days last week. Local residents have criticised the new building. Keith Garner, a Battersea architect and campaigner, said the new glass tower blocks would be creating a &quot;Dystopia-on-Thames&quot; at odds with the urban environment of London. &quot;It&apos;s very damaging and putting the developers&apos; interests over those of the local community. You could do something that would respect the genius of London \u2013 it seems strange to resort to this Singapore approach in Nine Elms.&quot; Proximity to the heliport is a key feature stressed by estate agents in a part of a capital now being aggressively marketed to the international super-rich.

As an ecologist, he had already made the decision to pursue his research in Asia because the ecology of the UK had been comprehensively studied: &quot;If you&apos;re interested in environmental change, this is the part of the world to be in. That&apos;s where most of the biodiversity is, and where most of the biodiversity has been lost.&quot; Now the chair professor in ecology and biodiversity at the university, Dudgeon has witnessed huge change. When he arrived, HKU was principally a teaching university, and most students were drawn from the local population. As a result of a government decision in the late 1980s to expand higher education and fund innovation, the university now has an international research reputation, and students come from all over the world. Much of HKU&apos;s success derives from its policy of advertising every academic position internationally, with the result that the majority of staff are recruited from\u00a0overseas. The same policy has been deployed elsewhere in Asia, particularly in south-east Asia. In 1998, Professor Barry Halliwell arrived at the National University of Singapore (NUS) from King&apos;s College London for a year&apos;s sabbatical, and stayed. Now deputy president, he says that 65% of the university&apos;s academics are recruited from abroad, ranging from junior researchers to those with full professorships in prestigious universities. &quot;When we recruit, we always look for people who are more nimble, who think in different ways,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of people come and say, &apos;This is a place I can make my mark.&apos;&quot; Specialisation Because of the relatively small size of the region&apos;s universities (HKU has 20,000 students), they compete with other, more famous universities by specialising, says Professor Roland Chin, deputy vice-chancellor and provost of HKU: &quot;We can&apos;t be good at everything \u2013 we want to be good in the things that we do. Some universities are more focused in life sciences, some are focused on computer sciences. Each university has its own niche.&quot; That niche is often related to local circumstances. Halliwell says that NUS&apos;s Cancer Research Centre of Excellence focuses on cancers that are more common in Singapore and Asia than elsewhere, such as non smoking-related lung cancers in women. Similarly, most drug treatments have been developed in the west, leaving a gap that needs to be plugged by research: &quot;Drug metabolism among Indians, Malays and Chinese, the major ethnic groups in Singapore, is different. There are some drugs that don&apos;t work well on Caucasians that work beautifully on Chinese, and there are many drugs the other way around. The Asian phenotype is one of our major areas of research.&quot; To boost its research expertise, NUS offers cross-faculty grants to encourage academics from different backgrounds to work together on inter-disciplinary projects. &quot;A lot of advances come when people working in different areas get talking to each other,&quot; says Halliwell. Opportunities With so many universities in the west suffering the effects of recession, what south-east Asia&apos;s universities offer above all is the sense of possibility. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) was founded in 1991, but has already achieved an international reputation in research, and this year was named the top university in Asia in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) rankings. Its youthful vibrancy has proved an asset, says Professor Wei Shyy, the university&apos;s provost: &quot;We are less burdened by history and tradition. Nobody will say, &apos;50 years ago we did this&apos; or &apos;We&apos;ve been doing it this way for 500 years.&apos; The university is only 21 years old. We have the hunger to be better, to be truly outstanding.&quot; For Dudgeon, working in Hong Kong has provided the opportunity to witness a fast-changing environment as well as to carve out a stellar reputation in a previously under-researched area. &quot;If you&apos;re interested in an institution or a place where you know what it&apos;s going to be like in two years, Hong Kong is not the place for you,&quot; he says. &quot;If you&apos;re interested in somewhere that is going to be changing, and interested in the opportunities that might throw up, this is a good place to work.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

HMV called in administrators Deloitte on Monday after failing to trade its way out of financial difficulty, and is seeking a buyer to save the 91-year old chain, which operates 247 stores globally. Suppliers including the music majors have already pumped perhaps as much as \u00a340m into helping prop up HMV, which accounts for around a quarter of all physical CDs and DVDs sold in the UK annually. HMV&apos;s suppliers have a vested interest in keeping it in business, to ensure competition against the rising power of online retailers such as Amazon, prompting speculation that a rescue bid for the high street chain might emerge from this group. A consortium of suppliers \u2013 which included the music majors and movie companies Warner Bros and Universal Pictures \u2013 were given warrants that, under certain conditions, converted to 2.5% of equity. The company is now in administration so any equity is worthless. However, despite the close ties and, to a degree, interdependence of the chain and the record labels none of the big three music companies intend to table an offer to buy HMV. It is also thought unlikely that either Universal Music, Warner Music or Sony Music will be tempted to join any consortium buyout of HMV, if one was to materialise. Trevor Moore, chief executive of HMV, said there is &quot;likely to be very many options for this business&quot; and that he remains &quot;passionate&quot; about developing a strategy for the retailer. It is understood that, although some store closures are inevitable, a number of private equity firms including Jon Moulton&apos;s Better Capital, Endless and Hilco, the owner of HMV Canada, are exploring bids for HMV. Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music all declined to comment. The stakes are somewhat heightened for Universal Music, which is liable for rent on 16 HMV stores as part of its \u00a31.2bn acquisition of EMI Music last year. It could face a rental bill running to millions of pounds if HMV is shut down and its stores are not re-let. EMI guaranteed rental agreements on a number of HMV stores when the retailer was spun off from the record label in 1998. Universal assumed these guarantees when it acquired EMI. After HMV floated on the UK stockmarket in 2002, EMI sold its final holding. At the time HMV&apos;s share price was as high as 177p. When it ceased trading on the stockmarket on Monday its share price was just a few pence. HMV owns 230 stores in the UK and Ireland and a further eight internationally, six in Hong Kong and two in Singapore. The retailer also wholly owns another nine stores which carry the Fopp brand, the independent retailer that was acquired by HMV after it went into administration in 2007. HMV employs about 4,550 staff, nearly all of these are in the UK. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

For anyone who has ever dabbled with the grazed knees and tweaked shoulders of a surfer&apos;s life, Noosa on Queensland&apos;s Sunshine Coast is one such place. And that&apos;s how we found ourselves heading out of Brisbane one Friday evening on a hippy quest. Back in the 60s, it was accessible only by dirt road, with limited amenities and fewer people \u2013 where the pristine natural environment drew the soul surfers. Noosa had been morphing through different identities for 40,000 years since the Kabi tribe used it as a sacred retreat \u2013 everything from a logging town to a gold-mining centre. But as the surfers arrived, a mystique developed around Noosa&apos;s five beach surf breaks, which coupled with its strong spiritual heritage to create an enclave of hippiedom \u2013 a seemingly remote outpost of simple living. It didn&apos;t last. News of Noosa&apos;s beautiful environment spread and as transport improved people swarmed to the town for weekends away. From a dirt road in the 60s, Hastings Street has developed into a strip of boutiques and restaurants serving the luxury apartments that have mushroomed along the Noosa River inlet. The hippy vibe has given way to glitz \u2013 Richard Branson&apos;s A$7m (\u00a36.5m) retreat Makepeace Island is just one of many plush properties. But we wanted the hippy experience, so here we were 20\u00a0minutes outside Noosa Heads on a\u00a0deserted forest road, wrestling with a\u00a0spider the size of a human head which had dropped through the car window. Noosa North Shore campground is a two-minute ferry ride across the Noosa River. You drive to the bottom of Beach Road and arrive at the spectacular campsite. Look right and, through the sea spray, you can just make out the bay, behind which sit 4,000 acres of pristine national park. Look left, and all you&apos;ve got is empty beach stretching 60km up to Double Island Point.     Cooling off: a refreshments vendor on the beach at Noosa in Queensland. Photograph: Nick Rains/Corbis    The name Noosa derives from the Aboriginal word &quot;noothera&quot; meaning shadow, in reference to the tall forests which offer respite from the subtropical sun. We sought shelter under their branches, pitching our tent in a\u00a0shady spot a few steps from the sea. We cooked curry on the stove, watched the sky turn violet while the waves foamed and in the morning we dodged jellyfish for a deserted dawn swim only to find a couple of kangaroos hopping around the tent on our return. Wild koalas populated the trees and large lizards wandered along the sandy paths. &quot;In Noosa you can be out there in the ocean and not see one building,&quot; local yoga teacher Natasha Patten told us. &quot;The development has been intelligently done to preserve that &apos;soulful surfer vibe&apos;. At sunset you can see a lone turtle pop its head out of the water, breathe in the salty air, and be in awe of the beauty that surrounds you.&quot; We decided to test our surf legs at Sunshine Beach, just south of Noosa bay. We struggled with the dumping waves, tasting far too much sand and not enough surf. Our egos suitably crushed, we later sipped beers and ate burgers on the deck of the Sunshine Beach Surf Lifesaving Club. It&apos;s a slice of no-nonsense Australia with epic views in a town where a plate of pasta requires a bottle of red to wash down the shock of the price. &quot;It&apos;s nature more than anything man-made that defines Noosa,&quot; said Tim Crabtree, who runs Noosa Longboards, a shop which specialises in boards over 9ft long which are suited to Noosa&apos;s mellow waves. &quot;The surf scene here is embraced by all walks of life.&quot; Tim&apos;s parked 1964 Ford Woody Wagon, complete with longboard on the roof, was a little snapshot of the way things used to be, provoking a quick pang of longing to turn back the clock. On the other SIDE of Double Island Point lies Rainbow Beach, accessible on foot from Noosa via the 102km Cooloola Great Walk. It too has decent surf \u2013 on a good day the right-hander can roll up to 500m \u2013 but Rainbow Beach is a bit further up the coast and that little bit more inaccessible, and so has missed out on Noosa&apos;s weekender traffic. The town lies at the end of a 70km detour from the main highway \u2013 one way in, one way out \u2013 and this road has existed only since 1969, before which access was via boat from Tin Can Bay. But for a brief moment in time \u2013 long enough for &quot;Noosa people&quot; to build a large bar and restaurant in the centre of town \u2013 Rainbow teetered on the edge of becoming the new Noosa. &quot;Rainbow is limited in size because it&apos;s surrounded by national parks,&quot; says Jenny Jarvis, who runs the Mia Mia B&amp;B with her husband John. &quot;Good for us but not the economy.&quot;     Nice wheels: Susan Greenwood with a 1964 Ford Woody Wagon. Photograph: Observer    The couple arrived in Rainbow in 2000 after three years travelling around Australia. It took John 14 months to build the property himself, gradually adding features such as fire pits, decks and an infinity pool which looks over the back garden forest. He&apos;s the kind of capable Aussie man who laughs in your face when you mention a spider in your car. We dined on the lobster-like Moreton Bay Bugs that John&apos;s neighbour had caught earlier in the day. Staying at Mia Mia was homely and cosy and very authentic. The beach itself, with its multicoloured sands, is a remarkable sight. According to Aboriginal legend, Yiningie, the spirit of the gods who is represented by a rainbow, was thrown into the sand cliffs in a\u00a0fight over a woman, scattering his colours across them. The scientific explanation of rare mineral deposits is slightly less poetic, but the action of sitting still and drawing circles in the sand, revealing different layers of colour as you go, is still mesmeric whatever you believe. Maybe Rainbow will never be the new Noosa, but you get the feeling it could be the old Noosa.

Recovering from a bout of malaria on the remote Indonesian island of Halmahera, the young British biologist came up with an idea that would transform humanity&apos;s view of itself: he worked out the theory of natural selection. Wallace wrote down his idea and sent it to Charles Darwin, who had been contemplating a similar theory of evolution for more than a decade. Both versions were read to members of the Linnean Society in 1858. Today Darwin is the man who gets the lion&apos;s share of the credit for a theory that provides the mechanism to explain how a species can be slowly transformed into another. Wallace has been forgotten. But this week curators at the Natural History Museum, London, will launch Wallace 100, a project aimed at righting this wrong. On Thursday, Wallace&apos;s portrait \u2013 which has been kept for years in a storeroom \u2013 will be hung beside the grand statue of Darwin that overlooks the museum&apos;s main hall. Wallace&apos;s entire correspondence will also be put online. &quot;It has taken two years to find all his letters from universities scattered round the world and to put them online,&quot; said George Beccaloni, a curator and expert on Wallace. &quot;Now people can see just what a fine writer he was, and what a great mind he had.&quot; The museum&apos;s ceremony marks the beginning of its Wallace 100 programme, which will mark the centenary of Wallace&apos;s death and aims to bring him back to the public&apos;s attention. Comedian Bill Bailey, a committed fan of the biologist, will unveil the portrait on Thursday and will also host a BBC2 TV series about Wallace which is to be screened in spring. The programme involved Bailey following Wallace&apos;s footsteps round the East Indies where the biologist was working on an expedition to collect birds and animals in the 19th century. &quot;I was on a trip to Malaysia a few years ago and discovered there was a huge group of Indonesian islands known as Wallacea, named after Wallace,&quot; Bailey told the Observer. &quot;He is still considered to be a hugely important figure there but has been ignored in Britain. I got interested and became absorbed by the man, like so many other individuals have been. There is a sort of secret society of Wallace fans. Mention his name and you create a frisson of interest among these people. I have tried to get over the feeling of the excitement that is evoked by his name in our programmes.&quot; Wallace was born in Usk, Monmouthshire, to middle-class parents, but was forced to leave school at 13 when the family fell on hard times. He worked as a surveyor before deciding to travel to the Amazon to collect specimens and to work as a naturalist. After four years, with his health deteriorating, he sailed home. Twenty-six days out of port, his ship caught fire and his drawings, most of his notes and his collection of specimens were destroyed. Wallace survived, in an open lifeboat, with only a couple of notebooks and an indignant parrot. Two years later, Wallace left Britain again. This time he sailed to the Malay archipelago (now Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia) where he spent nearly eight years collecting and studying the local wildlife. These included the standardwing bird of paradise which is now named Semioptera wallacei after the biologist. &quot;It is a beautiful bird and Wallace was particularly impressed by it, though they are difficult to find, for they live deep inside forests,&quot; added Bailey. &quot;We were lucky. We filmed one in perfect high definition for the programme.&quot; In 1858, in Halmahera, Wallace wrote his essay on natural selection and posted it to Darwin. Darwin and his friends, the botanist Joseph Hooker and Charles Lyell, were horrified. Darwin had been working on a similar theory for several years and now faced the prospect of being robbed of glory. Lyell and Hooker arranged a reading for Wallace&apos;s paper and for a hastily written one by Darwin at the same meeting of the Linnean Society. &quot;It was a rather shabby trick,&quot; said Bailey. &quot;Wallace had sent his paper to Darwin to help get it published. Unluckily for him, he sent it to the one person in the world who had a vested interest in not seeing in print. Lyell and Hooker intervened and a reading was arranged instead. &quot;Darwin&apos;s paper was read first and he is the one we now remember as the man who came up with the idea of natural selection. Wallace should have got priority, but it was Darwin, the man with the connections, who got the glory.&quot; In fact, Wallace did fairly well when he came back to Britain and he produced an extremely popular book, The Malay Archipelago, which provides a vivid, highly readable account of his travels in the East Indies. At one point he admits to sleeping comfortably one night &quot;with half-a-dozen smoke-dried human skulls suspended over my head&quot;. Joseph Conrad kept a copy of the book on his bedside table and drew on it for his own works, including Lord Jim. More recently, David Attenborough has admitted reading the book as a schoolboy and credits it with stimulating his interest in the natural world. &quot;It is wonderful book,&quot; added Beccaloni. &quot;It is written in modern English and is not at all stilted, as so many Victorian books seem today. It reveals what an advanced thinker Wallace was.&quot; www.nhm.ac.uk/wallace100"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jan/20/rbs-awaits-fines-libor-rigging", "sentences": ["An indication of the type of evidence is provided by documents filed in a Singapore court by a former RBS trader, Tan Chi Min, who is bringing a case of wrongful dismissal on the basis that the bank condoned the manipulation of Libor.", "First reported by Bloomberg in September, the 231 pages of filings in the Singapore court show that Tan sent an instant message in April 2008 saying: &quot;Nice Libor\u00a0\u2026 our six month fixing moved the entire fixing hahaha&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-20T17:33:15Z", "title": "RBS awaits hefty fines for Libor rigging", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Libor", "Banking", "Business", "UK news", "Financial sector"], "article": "It sounds like such fun. A Royal Bank of Scotland trader quips &quot;hahaha&quot; in a series of jovial electronic exchanges as he goes about his work. But it will soon become clear that however much fun the trader felt he was having, the repercussions for the bailed-out bank will be anything but when it is hit with a staggering \u00a3500m or so in fines for manipulating Libor. Ever since Barclays was fined \u00a3290m in June for rigging the benchmark interest rate, Stephen Hester, the RBS chief executive, has been softening the ground for the bailed-out bank to suffer a similar \u2013 or worse \u2013 humiliation by regulators on both sides on Atlantic. Hester&apos;s counterpart at Barclays, Bob Diamond, was forced out within days of the Libor fine being announced in June but the RBS chief executive will be hoping to secure the support of regulators even though the fixing of Libor appears to have carried on for two years after he was parachuted in during October 2008. But top managers at the RBS investment bank, including its chief executive, John Hourican, who it has since emerged was planning to leave after reshaping the business \u2013 may quit to take responsibility for the disregard shown for the market even though they are not personally culpable. The head of global trading, Peter Rading \u2013 whose controversial redevelopment of his home in London emerged last week \u2013 resigned on Friday for personal reasons and although the timing could prove helpful for RBS, there is no suggestion he was involved. While the evidence published by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and US regulators as they announce the fine will not name individuals, it will shine a light on the way traders fixed an interest rate used to determine borrowing costs of $300 trillion (\u00a3189tn) of financial contracts \u2013 ranging from mortgages to loans for big companies. An indication of the type of evidence is provided by documents filed in a Singapore court by a former RBS trader, Tan Chi Min, who is bringing a case of wrongful dismissal on the basis that the bank condoned the manipulation of Libor. First reported by Bloomberg in September, the 231 pages of filings in the Singapore court show that Tan sent an instant message in April 2008 saying: &quot;Nice Libor\u00a0\u2026 our six month fixing moved the entire fixing hahaha&quot;. In other messages he describes Libor as a &quot;cartel&quot; and discusses how a hedge fund will be &quot;kissing&quot; another trader if the rate can be brought down, evoking memories of the promises by Barclays&apos; Libor traders to deliver bottles of Bollinger champagne for shifting the rate. By the time regulators began to investigate Libor in May 2011 Tan was asking in a quick, informally written instant message: &quot;Question is what is illegal? If making money if bank fix it to suits its own books are illegal\u00a0\u2026 then no point fixing it right? Cuz there will be days when we will def make money fixing it&quot;. The way Libor is set is being overhauled but when the offences took place dozens of banks submitted the price at which they thought they would be charged to borrow from each other in 10 different series of currencies and across 15 borrowing periods up to one year. It proved to be easy to manipulate and was regarded as such a low-risk business that few senior managers paid much attention to it. Swiss bank UBS has so far incurred the largest fine, \u00a3940m, in a regulatory action announced last month which for the first time lifted the lid on payments made by traders to the interdealer brokers that help the banks decide what price to submit to the Libor panel. The FSA has several other cases under way, the Serious Fraud Office is also investigating the process while the US has charged two traders. RBS, a bank into which the UK taxpayer has pumped \u00a345bn, is a target for politicians still facing an electorate angered by the impact of the banking crisis, which ironically had begun to put a focus on Libor. During the most fraught days of the financial crisis the submissions made by banks to the Libor panel began to be scrutinised for signs of those that might be in distress \u2013 a higher rate might indicate that rival banks were charging higher interest rates because they had doubts about a particular bank&apos;s financial strength. This came to light during the Barclays case when it emerged that there was some confusion about whether the Bank of England deputy governor Paul Tucker had been encouraging Barclays to reduce its Libor submissions during the 2008 crisis. Diamond&apos;s senior colleague Jerry del Missier also ended up quitting as he allowed staff to lower Libor submissions \u2013 seemingly believing that was what regulators wanted \u2013 and a series of parliamentary hearings tried to establish if policymakers had been involved. Hester will argue that his focus in the early days of the crisis was on bringing RBS back from the brink, rather than on Libor. After the Barclays fine last summer, as he admitted RBS was in the frame, Hester said: &quot;Even though when all the Libor [fines] are out most of it is going to be around the wrongdoings of a handful of people at a number of banks. Those wrongdoings taint a whole industry beyond the handful of people and that makes it a huge problem.&quot; The bank will want to show that action has been taken. Four people have been fired. The head of rates trading for European and Asia Pacific Jezri Mohideen \u2013 who told Bloomberg he had not pressured colleagues to change Libor submissions \u2013 was suspended in October. The bank will be hoping its actions will be enough to appease the public mood before the scandal moves on to the other financial firms still under investigation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/21/delhi-gang-rape-trial-begins", "sentences": ["The victims were eventually dumped on the roadside, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T12:03:41Z", "title": "Delhi gang rape trial begins", "tags": ["India", "World news"], "article": "Five men accused of the brutal gang rape and murder of a student in Delhi have gone on trial in a new fast-track court in the Indian capital that was set up after the incident to bring speedy justice to victims of sexual violence. The attack on 16 December provoked outrage and grief in India, with protests across the country. It has led to an unprecedented national debate and calls for widespread changes in cultural attitudes as well as policing and legal reform. The five men on trial could face the death sentence if convicted. A sixth accused, believed to be 17 years old, is likely to face a separate proceedings. The trial is being held behind closed doors, with media excluded. The men arrived at the courtroom wearing hoods. A date will be set later on Monday for the next hearing. Police say the victim and a male friend were heading home from an evening movie when they boarded the bus. The attackers beat the man and raped the woman, causing her massive internal injuries with a metal bar, police said. The victims were eventually dumped on the roadside, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. Attacks that previously would have received little publicity are now frontpage news in India. In the north-western Punjab state they have included a 17-year-old who killed herself after being repeatedly raped by two men in December, a woman raped by six men after being hauled from a bus in which she was the only passenger and another raped by two men after being drugged last weekend. An attack by five men on a teenager in Haryana state has also been reported, as well as the rape of a minor in Rajasthan. In the Delhi case, prosecutors have said DNA evidence links the accused to the crime, but defence lawyers say police &quot;tortured&quot; and beat their clients into making confessions. Such abuse is systemic in India. One lawyer said he would ask the supreme court to move the trial out of New Delhi to ensure his client got a fair trial. The fast-track courts are among the measures taken or being considered by authorities to tackle the problem of sexual violence and particularly the impunity of many offenders. Many families pressure relatives who have been assaulted not to press charges, police often refuse to file cases for those who do and courts rarely deliver swift justice in the few cases that are filed. Indian courts had a backlog of 33m cases as of 2011. Delhi police records show a rise in reported rape cases in 2012 of nearly a quarter, taking the total to 702. The numbers increased at the end of the year in the city, which has a population of around 15 million. Only one of the 635 rape cases filed in the capital last year has ended in a conviction so far. Police said it was not realistic to expect crimes committed late last year to have wound their way through the system yet. Ranjana Kumari, a women&apos;s activist and director of the Centre for Social Research, a New Delhi based thinktank, said the fast-track courts were an important step for clearing some of the 95,000 rape cases pending in India. &quot;We need a system in which women can get justice quickly. Otherwise, in the normal course of things, it can take 10 or 12 or 14 years for cases to be taken up by the court. That is tantamount to denying justice to the victim,&quot; she said. Others, however, are worried that fast-track courts sacrifice justice for speed, overlooking evidence, limiting the cross-examination of witnesses and racing through hearings.

His statue of Alison Lapper, installed on the Fouth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2005, was recreated for the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics. But did the audience applaud the work of art or its message? Quinn has fused the conceptual methods of contemporary British art with generous injections of political correctness and heroic sentiment to create some of the shallowest art of our time. His art is as soulful as a coalition audit. Now he&apos;s done it again, this time in Singapore. The Gardens by the Bay in Singapore have just unveiled Planet, a giant white sculpture by Quinn of his baby son that seems to float above the ground. Babies! Paternal love! How can you fault it? Easy. No problem faulting this. Good feeling is not the same thing as good art. I am delighted that Quinn is soppy about his son, but see no reason why he should share this on such a colossal scale. Art that flaunts its content in an immediately readable way risks vacuity. Shouldn&apos;t there be some ambiguity, even profundity, in art? The appeal of Quinn, I assume, is that he takes on big, bold subjects with visceral directness. In the first place, there was Self, his self-portrait in frozen blood. This is still his most interesting work, a gory reduction of portraiture to organic essentials. It might have led somewhere dark and original \u2013 but instead, it gave birth to manipulative mass-attention-seeking non-masterpieces, such as his portraits of Kate Moss. Art should challenge us. How does Quinn&apos;s giant floating baby do that? Everyone can see what it is \u2013 a bland cocktail of awe and empathy. Quinn says the sculpture plays on weight (it is made of heavy metal) and the illusion of weightlessness. He talks the talk, but his sculpture does not walk the walk. I don&apos;t believe anyone sees this as being about weight, mass or forces. That&apos;s how we experience real sculpture by Richard Serra or Barnett Newman. All we see when we look at Quinn&apos;s baby is &quot;iconic&quot; content. He effaces the art in art, in a way that makes his simple images accessible to busy people. His real stroke of genius in Trafalgar Square back in 2005 was to create an image that drivers passing by could respond to. He makes art you can enjoy from your car. Indeed, he makes art you do not need to see. His icons are so reductive, they just stimulate chatter instead of sustained looking. He is an artist for the information age, because his art is pure information. The trouble is, it&apos;s the interference, white noise and static that makes art interesting. Quinn has clinically cleansed all that poetic mess. He is lethally efficient in his pursuit of the banal."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/21/leveson-chief-inquisitor-uk-press", "sentences": ["&quot;What the Leveson inquiry demonstrated beyond argument is that sections of the British press are unruly and that the basis for asserting that the press is under-regulated appears strong,&quot; Jay told the Singapore Academy of Law in a speech earlier this month.", "Jay, predicted that another of Leveson&apos;s proposals \u2013 an arbitration arm that resolves privacy and libel disputes involving newspapers \u2013 would soon become the norm in the UK.Jay&apos;s speech to lawyers and academics in Singapore marks a return to the public eye for Leveson&apos;s chief inquisitor, who grilled David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Tony Blair and dozens of celebrities at the inquiry."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-21T15:33:35Z", "title": "Leveson's chief inquisitor calls UK press 'most unruly and irreverent in world'", "tags": ["Leveson inquiry", "Robert Jay", "Law", "UK news", "Media", "Leveson report", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers"], "article": "     The lead counsel to the Leveson inquiry into newspaper standards and ethics, Robert Jay, has described the British press as &quot;the most unruly and irreverent in the world&quot;. The QC also dismissed as &quot;scaremongering&quot; concerns that statutory recognition of a new press regulator would be a slippery slope. He described the fears as capable of being overstated. In his first public address since the end of the inquiry, Jay criticised the &quot;prurient or intrusive tendencies&quot; of tabloid newspapers that invade the privacy of individuals without a public interest defence. &quot;What the Leveson inquiry demonstrated beyond argument is that sections of the British press are unruly and that the basis for asserting that the press is under-regulated appears strong,&quot; Jay told the Singapore Academy of Law in a speech earlier this month. He added: &quot;My impression is that the press in the UK could well qualify as the most unruly and irreverent in the world, and I have travelled widely; it is fearless, and it speaks its mind. &quot;To be described as &apos;unruly and irreverent&apos; would be regarded by most editors and journalists as a badge of honour, not of aspersion. Many would argue that these qualities make the press in the UK the best in the world, because the dividing line between fearlessness in holding power to account and unruliness in disparaging the rights of private individuals is almost impossible to draw.&quot; Jay said that an ideal press should be able to launch serious investigations into &quot;the dark crevices of government&quot; while respecting the rights of individuals where there is no public interest in prying further. It was &quot;somewhat pessimistic&quot; to argue that a free press will occasionally intrude on the private lives of innocent members of the public, he added. Jay used the speech to back the key proposals of the Leveson report into the future of press regulation, published in November, and said any opinions were his and not the judge&apos;s. &quot;I would not wish to sound complacent, but in my view in the cultural context of the UK, those fears [about statutory underpinning for a new press regulator] amount to scaremongering. I do not see any slope, let alone a slippery one,&quot; he said. &quot;Statute can be both the servant and enemy of press freedom, depending on the cultural context and on exactly what it provides.&quot; He argued that Leveson&apos;s recommendation of a new law to create an independent press regulator would not &quot;be anathema to the constitutional principles which a mature democracy jealously safeguards&quot;. That proposal in Leveson&apos;s 2,000-page report has proved divisive for many editors and politicians. The prime minister dismissed the recommendation as &quot;the crossing of a Rubicon&quot; within hours of its public unveiling in November. Jay, predicted that another of Leveson&apos;s proposals \u2013 an arbitration arm that resolves privacy and libel disputes involving newspapers \u2013 would soon become the norm in the UK.Jay&apos;s speech to lawyers and academics in Singapore marks a return to the public eye for Leveson&apos;s chief inquisitor, who grilled David Cameron, Rupert Murdoch, Tony Blair and dozens of celebrities at the inquiry. The speech will be welcomed by fans of Jay&apos;s often flamboyant wordplay, with references to &quot;metaphorical doldrums&quot;, &quot;inchoate&quot; privacy rights, and &quot;a rough and ready rather than a Rolls Royce&quot; system of justice. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

Tensions over the island chain \u2013 known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China \u2013 have escalated since Japan bought the islands from private owners. Chinese ships returned to waters around the disputed islands on Monday, the Japanese coastguard said, for the 24th time since the row broke out. Japan&apos;s defence minister has refused to rule out the use of warning shots to deter Chinese aircraft from flying nearby, a move that would raise the stakes. This month China scrambled fighter jets to tail Japanese fighters that were shadowing a Chinese surveillance plane. The row is shaded by broader concerns: neighbours are anxious about an increasingly powerful China, while China fears the US is seeking to contain it. Beijing hit out at Washington after Clinton said that while the US did not take a position on the sovereignty of the chain, it opposed &quot;any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japanese administration&quot;. The Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei told a briefing on Monday that the outgoing US secretary of state&apos;s comments were &quot;ignorant of facts and indiscriminate of rights and wrongs&quot;, echoing a statement issued the previous day. He said the US \u2013 which controlled the islands from 1945 to 1972 before returning them to Japan \u2013 had &quot;undeniable historical responsibility&quot; in the dispute. Taiwan also claims sovereignty over the chain. Professor Huang Jing, an expert on regional security at the National University of Singapore, said US credibility in the Asia-Pacific region was at stake and Washington needed to show leadership by convincing both sides to negotiate. &quot;In public it&apos;s China versus the US. In private I think it&apos;s more difficult to convince not China, but Japan. There&apos;s too much at stake for the Japanese leadership,&quot; he said. &quot;I think there&apos;s still a fine line neither side is trying to cross,&quot; he added, pointing out that Japanese patrols had not forced Chinese vessels from the area, while China had kept military ships away. But he said: &quot;Political survival on both sides is more important than avoiding a skirmish or even war.&quot; The countries could take a step back as long as peace endured, but it would be far harder &quot;to catch up or patch up after something happens&quot;, Huang said. Shogo Suzuki, an expert on Sino-Japanese relations and visiting associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, said: &quot;All it takes is one hothead to pull the trigger and the whole thing spirals out of control. It&apos;s a dangerous situation and I think both sides have trapped themselves.&quot; The recent aerial standoff ended without incident, but the proximity of Chinese to Japanese fighters heightens the risk of an accident or pilot error leading to a wider conflict between Asia&apos;s two biggest economies. Tokyo is considering stationing a fleet of fighter jets closer to the islands. The defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, suggested that Japanese pilots could use tracer fire to warn Chinese fighters that their presence had been noted and that further action could follow. &quot;Every country has procedures for how to deal with a violation of its territory that continues after multiple cautionary measures,&quot; Onodera said. &quot;We have response measures ready that are consistent with global standards.&quot; Chinese officials said the use of tracer fire would not go unanswered, and accused Japan of deliberately raising tensions. Chinese media have stressed the need to improve military preparedness, though without making direct reference to the territorial row. Some observers see possible hints of a thaw, such as reports that Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has asked a coalition partner, Natsuo Yamaguchi of the New Komeito party, to bear a personal message to Chinese leaders in a visit that begins on Tuesday. Suzuki said Abe&apos;s hawkish credentials should protect him from charges of being weak on China, potentially allowing him to take the initiative. But Huang Dahui, director of the centre for East Asian studies at Renmin University in Beijing, argued Abe had already toughened Tokyo&apos;s stance. &quot;Japan has intensified the relationship with the US to suppress China, and has made efforts to rope in other South Asian countries which also have territorial problems with China, such as India, and other countries which have different values from China. They are trying to build a network against China,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/jan/22/new-zealand-civil-service-improvement-iain-rennie", "sentences": ["Rennie praised Singapore as an example of a civil service which has balanced immediate responsiveness with foward thinking."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-22T09:39:40Z", "title": "New Zealand commissioner has called for civil service improvement", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network"], "article": "Iain Rennie, New Zealand&apos;s state service commissioner, has called on civil servants across the world to remember to think ahead in addition to addressing short-term challenges.

Rennie praised Singapore as an example of a civil service which has balanced immediate responsiveness with foward thinking. &quot;It&apos;s about fostering a culture of continuous improvement in our public service; that we&apos;re not satisfied with the status quo but are always thinking about how we can do better,&quot; he said. He said the New Zealand government was about to bring to parliament legislation which would create an obligation for chief executives to be &quot;stewards&quot; for their organisation, a role which Rennie describes as &quot;thinking ahead, and ensuring that their organisation has the capacity to deliver effectively in the future as well as today.&quot; Speaking about talent sourcing, Rennie said that public servants must &quot;build a brand for the public service in terms of employment.&quot; He said that age should not be the focus, but that the aim was to &quot;get the best and brightest and offer New Zealanders, whether younger or older, an exciting career and a real possibility to change lives&quot;. Rennie acknowledged that new recruits to the civil service face an environment which is &quot;more complex, more unpredictable and more ambiguous&quot; than in the past, and that they must be prepared for this. He added that organisations must offer potential leaders &quot;a portfolio of experiences that will stretch them, that will challenge them, that may give them in effect a taste of failure early in their careers&quot;, so that they have the capacity to lead the public service into the future.

Sir David Normington, the man who is being lined up for a key role in establishing the board of a new press regulator, has had several bruising encounters during his time as a senior official in a series of government departments over a 30-year career. His was the permanent secretary in the education department under David Blunkett, where he earned his reputation as something of a tough nut, deciding to cut the workforce by a third. This is thought to have counted against him when Normington applied to be Cabinet secretary, losing out to Sir Gus O&apos;Donnell. He spent five years in the education department before moving to the Home Office, where he found himself at the wrong end of a verbal onslaught by the combative then home secretary John Reid, who branded his department &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. Those who know him say he is an ideal candidate to set up an appointments process to make sure the running of the new press regulator is untainted. &quot;He will easily stand up to any attempts to influence by editors. He is impeccable in terms of impartiality. He would not be seen to be in anyone&apos;s pocket,&quot; said one Labour insider who has worked with him in the past. &quot;He is a typical civil servant, very formal, but very approachable and quite well liked.

Normington, who left the civil service in late 2010 to become first civil service commissioner and commissioner for public appointments, has also had his brushes with the press.

Its European operation is in a futuristic building in London. Like all futuristic structures, it&apos;s beginning to look dated. Weird lights and slogans run across the floors. There is a vast aquarium of colour co-ordinated fish. In the atrium, 888 multi-coloured spheres light up as employees log in to their computers. It&apos;s the modern equivalent of clocking on: &quot;Your sphere was late lighting up this morning, Perkins. Flu again, or another of your hangovers?&quot; On giant screens around the building, Bloomberg TV pumped live coverage from the World Economic Forum in Davos, so that the myrmidons could learn the opinions of people who actually matter, unlike elected politicians.

In fact it was aimed at the Tory Hell&apos;s Angels who are giving him such a hard time. They must feel like dysfunctional schoolboys who tweet that they&apos;re going to bomb the airport, then watch with delight as two dozen fire engines and a Swat team scream up. Certainly, four hours later at prime minister&apos;s questions, they greeted Cameron with massive cheering and waving of order papers, like Bradford fans watching their team beat Aston Villa. I noticed only a minority were making the most noise. They loved his clear unequivocal message: &quot;We are going to leave Europe, unless we decide to stay!&quot; As always with a Cameron speech, there are the oddities that bring you up short even while it flows past you, as if a few inflatable ducks had been dropped into an Olympic swimming pool. &quot;The biggest danger to the EU comes \u2026 from those who denounce new thinking as heresy. Europe has experience of heretics who turned out to have a point!&quot; Was he comparing himself to the great heretics? Was he Dave Galileo, murmuring that the Earth does go round the sun? Changing the British mindset \u2013 we are an island nation \u2013 would be harder than &quot;draining the English channel&quot;. But, you think, you can&apos;t drain the English channel. It wouldn&apos;t work! And as you ponder that, you miss his animadversions on the role of Britain in Europe (which turned out to be largely thrashing the French and the Germans). Suddenly he was denouncing &quot;fast lanes and slow lanes, and countries missing trains and buses&quot;. It was time to &quot;consign the whole weary caravan of metaphors to a permanent siding!&quot; So cramming more weary caravans onto one railway track. Got that? In the Commons, he abused Ed Miliband for not saying if he would support the in-out referendum, even after Miliband had said he was agin it. This was getting surreal. The Labour leader wanted the PM to promise that he himself would vote to stay in, whatever. Cameron said he wanted to stay in but wouldn&apos;t promise because that would give away his negotiating stance. But we can guess what will happen. The EU leaders will give him some small concessions \u2013 he&apos;s already bragging about new trade ties with Singapore \u2013 and he will bring them back to us like Drake presenting to Elizabeth galleons rammed with Spanish gold.

However, there are a number of groups \u2013 tribes, or &quot;kei&quot; in Japanese \u2013 that have managed to evolve while staying relatively true to their origins. Members of these tribes can number into the hundreds of thousands, though more commonly they reach a few thousand youngsters before disappearing entirely. Many kei can be traced back to the Harajuku district, at the centre of which is Takeshita Dori, a street that is to Tokyo what Carnaby Street was once to London (only with added dayglo cuteness), and this should be the first destination for any determined follower of fashion. Here are a selection of the tribes that you would have a hard time missing on any trip to the Japanese capital. The Rollers of Yoyogi Park     Photograph: Alamy    Before we begin, let&apos;s get one thing straight. These guys aren&apos;t rockabillies, even though they might look old enough to have witnessed Gene Vincent in his heyday. They prefer to be known as &quot;Roller-Zoku&quot; (the Roller Family), and they take the business of dancing to old rock&apos;n&apos;roll numbers very seriously indeed (on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, near the gates of Yoyogi Park, without fail). It is thought that the Roller-Zoku have been a part of the Yoyogi furniture since the early 1990s, when a rockabilly revival swept parts of Japan. With their receding hairlines bullied into thinning quiffs, they may not look particularly threatening, but woe betide anyone who tries to join their antiquated dance. Simply do as the massed crowds surrounding them do: watch agog, but from a safe distance. Dolly Kei            On the border of the Harajuku and Shibuya district, you&apos;ll find Grimoire, a fanciful clothing and accessories shop that sits at the centre of the Dolly Kei movement. Followers dress in what might be described as a Tokyo take on Ye Olde Europe, favouring velvets, silks and rich embroidery. Think Little Bo Peep meets Hans Christian Anderson on a set imagined by Hayao Miyazaki, and you might be somewhere close to the mindspace inhabited by the brothers and sisters Grimoire. Having surfaced in 2010, seemingly as the subject of a series of blogs that surrounded the shop itself, the Dollies have survived long enough to be seen as genuine contenders \u2013 quite a feat in the transient world of Tokyo fashion. Lolita Kei     Photograph: Yuriko Nakao/Reuters/Corbis    Japanese tribes may be a disparate bunch, but at some point in each development cycle, one word is guaranteed to surface: kawaii. If it&apos;s kawaii (cute) it sells, and no fashion typifies it more readily than the dubiously titled Loli Kei (Lolita tribe). The Lolis decorate themselves in a riot of pinks, frills, bonnets, aprons and shepherds&apos; crooks \u2013 there&apos;s enough fairyland fantasy here to make Barbie turn away in disgust. The fashion has been flirting with the mainstream for more than a decade, but the unexpected twists in its journey have kept it interesting (see below). Gosurori     Photograph: Damon Coulter/Alamy    Gosurori is an amalgamation of two non-Japanese words, gosu being the Japanese pronunciation of the English word goth, and rori, an abbreviated version of the name Lolita. To become a respectable Gosurori, take the previously discussed Lolita outfit, dye it black, edge it with pristine, snow-white lace and apply makeup to match. The Gosuroris have been a part of the Harajuku scene since the late 1990s, and it is thought their existence may owe something to the cross-pollination of the Lolita tribe and the now defunct Visual Kei movement that took its inspiration from Japanese hair metal bands like Glay and L&apos;Arc En Ciel, both phenomenally successsful in the mid-90s. A more disturbing set of love children it is hard to imagine. Harajuku Kei            The Harajuku district is where it all begins for the majority of Tokyo&apos;s tribes \u2013 so many, in fact, that the Japanese press occasionally refer to the local fashionistas under the umbrella term, Harajuku Kei. In its current form, it appears as though the members have simply woken up, stepped out of bed and been attacked by a variety of brightly coloured and frequently clashing clothes. Homemade and swapped accessories play a huge part, and nobody does this hodgepodge style as well as 19-year-old Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, a young woman who appeared on Takeshita Street in 2010 as a fashion-obsessed high school blogger, and is now the face of her own brand. She sings too, after a fashion, and she&apos;ll be performing at the O2 Academy Islington, in London, on 13 February, though tickets are scarce. Gyaru Kei Longtime observers of Japanese fashion will recall the Ganguro tribe, a frightening army of teenagers who teased their hair into tight afros and wore blackface at weekends. While they have long since expired, the gyaru (&quot;gal&quot;) gangs that sprang up in their place are still a fixture on the Shibuya scene. Essentially fashion-conscious, late-teenage women, their look is defined by a kind of glam sassiness \u2013 sculpted hair, lavish but precise makeup and mini skirts. Ironically, given the fashion&apos;s ancestral roots, the latest incarnation (as dictated by tribal style bible, Egg Magazine) demands that the faithful gyaru whitens her skin. It doesn&apos;t come much more high maintenance than this. Gyaru-Oh Whatever the Gyarus can do, the Gyaru-Ohs can do better. Occasionally known as the Host Kei, these fellas spend as much time in front of the mirror as their female counterparts do, and the resulting ultra-effeminate look makes their Gyaru-Oh moniker fairly apt (the phrase can be translated as &quot;Girl Men&quot;). Such is the strength and number of their tribe that they, too, have been awarded their own tribal bible, the proudly named Mens&apos; Egg, which has a circulation of approximately 300,000 nationwide readers, and has even spawned a secondary publication for older Gyaru-Ohs called Men&apos;s Knuckle (circulation 200,000). The Gyaru-Oh&apos;s are a very striking force to be reckoned with. Kitakore Kei Like the Dolly Kei crowd, the relatively new Kitakore Kei have their own spiritual home, this time in the Koenji district. And what a lowly shed it is, too. The Kitakore Building is a tumbledown shop that looks as though it pays bully-money to the elements just to stay in existence, but this is entirely in keeping with the stock that the crowd flocks in to purchase. As a fashion, it is as random as the Harajuku Kei style, but without the bubblegum aesthetic. Punk seems too harsh a word, though it does share the DIY ethic. Most recently, the tribal manifesto has been described by a local editor as &quot;everyday something new&quot;, and this seems as accurate as you might ever hope to get. Otaku     Photograph: TWPhoto/Corbis    As any self-respecting web denizen will tell you, the otaku are no longer bound within Japan&apos;s borders. Sometimes defined as a form of geek chic, the fashionable wing of this subculture is occasionally referred to as Akiba Kei (named after the district it originated from, Akihabara), but in its nascent form Otaku seemed more like the unlucky hand of fate than a fashion statement. Common to tribe members old and young was a kind of dysfunctional existence spent living vicariously through the windows of a comic book, and a fanatical devotion to manufactured pop groups such as the phenomenally successful, 48-member-strong girl group, AKB48. As if the international reach of this seemingly bedroom-bound subculture needed demonstrating any further, there are now AKB48 franchises as far south as Singapore (SKG48). Cosplay     Photograph: Scilla / Demotix/Corbis    The lot of a Cosplayer is invariably lived out in a blue wig and chintzy fabric. Theirs is a life spent in the dressing up box, determined to approximate the look of their favourite anime character, although \u2013 like the world of the otaku \u2013 it is no longer confined to Japan.

The pain described is derived either from looking at the cars themselves, or from the embarrassment of having to drive one \u2013 it really depends on who you ask. Increasingly found out in the sticks, these &quot;pain cars&quot; can be spotted several miles off, commonly driven in small groups, usually decked out in lurid colours, sculpted attachments, and the kind of soft-focus imagery not seen in the west since the Athena poster company went out of business.

The lead counsel to the inquiry appears to have suggested that a possible answer to the problem of online libel is the &quot;imaginative solution&quot; of bringing ISPs &quot;within the scope of &apos;publishers&apos; for the purposes of the law of defamation&quot; and putting ISPs under a duty to ensure that they do not enable their customers to access defamatory content. Not surprisingly, that suggestion has received something of a backlash from internet enthusiasts. I can only assume that Jay was not really intending to suggest that all internet intermediaries should be liable for the defamatory material that third parties post on their websites and platforms. Such a law would not only be a serious step back for online development but would be totally unworkable in practice. The term &quot;ISP&quot; is an acronym that is used too often without a great deal of thought as to what it actually means. It is used most commonly in the internet industry to describe an internet access provider such as Sky Broadband, but it is also used loosely to describe other types of internet intermediary, including hosting providers like Demon Internet, platforms such as Facebook and Blogger.com, and even search engines such as Google. However, for the purposes of defamation law these intermediaries do not all fulfil the same functions and so cannot be lumped together in the same basket, as Jay seems to have done. That is why the law currently classifies internet access providers and other so-called &quot;mere conduits&quot; as non-publishers, but in certain circumstances recognises that other internet intermediaries (including website operators) can be classified as publishers if they are notified of libellous material being published through their servers or websites but fail to do anything about it. It is also why European legislators considered over 10 years ago that some internet intermediaries (or &quot;information society service providers&quot; as they are confusingly called in the E-Commerce Directive 2000) considered these issues carefully and decided that some but not all internet intermediaries deserved immunity from legal action in respect of third party content. This is in marked contrast to the position in the US, where all internet intermediaries are virtually immune from being sued for damages for defamation. But despite clear legislative defences for internet companies in the UK, drawing the line between publishers and non-publishers has not been easy for our judges. Back in 1999, Demon Internet were held liable for defamatory statements on a discussion forum which it hosted after it was notified of the material but failed to remove it for 12 days (although it was only liable for the damage caused in the 12 day period). That case has since given rise to the unwelcome practice of internet intermediaries simply removing material upon complaint without a great deal of scrutiny, causing a chilling effect on freedom of expression. However, other recent cases have gone the other way and offered more protection for internet intermediaries. In particular, Google has successfully defended recent claims for defamation both as the owner of a search engine and the operator of Blogger.com, even having not taken immediate action after being notified of the relevant defamatory material. We are currently waiting for the court of appeal to decide whether it agrees with one of those decisions in the case of Tamiz v Google. When that judgment is published, there will hopefully be a detailed exposition of the circumstances in which internet intermediaries become publishers for the purposes of defamation and matters will be much clearer. This issue was also debated at length by the House of Lords last week in the context of the defamation bill. Clause 5 aims to provide a new defence to website operators and encourage complainants and the internet users responsible for posting defamatory material to resolve their differences where possible without putting website operators in the impossible position of judge and jury. Their Lordships quickly realised that this area of the law is all about balance between the protection of reputation and freedom of expression: Of course Lord McAlpine should be able to write to Twitter and expect seriously false allegations of paedophilia to be removed quickly, as in fact happened. But that does not mean that website operators, search engines, hosting providers, and internet platforms should be diverting resources away from innovation in order to employ armies of libel lawyers to deal with libel complaints or simply removing material upon complaint for fear of legal liability. Google may be able to afford that but I doubt Mumsnet can. What is needed is a quick, easy, and cost-effective online dispute resolution process to deal at an early stage with the borderline libel complaints where website operators receive a take-down request but can&apos;t quite tell whether the complaint is legitimate or simply a company or individual chancing its arm to stifle legitimate criticism. Such a process, which does not currently exist, should be available both to large internet intermediaries and the many small-time bloggers who also receive defamation threats. And so while Jay is correct that &quot;increasingly imaginative solutions&quot; are necessary to deal with this problem, he can take comfort that there are currently plenty of lawyers, politicians and peers looking at these issues in great detail. Hopefully, he will therefore hold fire on developing his proposals for ISP liability until these avenues have been fully explored."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/27/cigarette-smuggling-mokhtar-belmokhtar-terrorism", "sentences": ["Documents shared with the Observer by intelligence experts show how one middleman, who regularly buys product from a major tobacco company, has a complex operation involving offices, warehouses and bank accounts in Cyprus, Brussels, Dubai, Malaysia, Egypt, Israel, Uruguay, Panama and Singapore that allows him to move cigarettes around the world without being traced."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-27T00:04:10Z", "title": "How cigarette smuggling fuels Africa's Islamist violence", "tags": ["Drugs trade", "Al-Qaida", "Algeria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Tobacco industry", "Human trafficking", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "For many years Mokhtar Belmokhtar was little more than a footnote in the intelligence reports analysing the increasingly muscular presence of Islamist groups in Saharan Africa. The man whose al-Qaida-inspired Signed in Blood Battalion led the attack on the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria, in which at least 38 people were killed, was considered a relatively unimportant figure in the political ecosystem of the vast region. But Belmokhtar, who fought for the mujahideen in Afghanistan and the Islamist GIA in the Algerian civil war before becoming a commander in the Mali-based al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was ambitious. In 2003 he masterminded the kidnapping of 32 European tourists whom he successfully ransomed. The money gave him the seed capital he needed to develop a sophisticated trading business throughout Saharan Africa, along the ancient 2,000-mile salt route used by the Tuareg tribesmen to transport goods from the continent&apos;s west coast through to Timbuktu in Mali, then on to Niger before arriving in the Algerian south, gateway to the Mediterranean. But while the Tuareg made their money in trading salt, gold and silk, Belmokhtar, who secured close links with the tribesmen through marriages to the daughters of several of their most prominent families, made a fortune through a different commodity: smuggled cigarettes. Such was the volume of his trade that he earned himself the sobriquet &quot;Mr Marlboro&quot;. &quot;He was not an important figure in AQIM, he was quite different from al-Qaida and Bin Laden,&quot; said Morten B\u00f8\u00e5s, a senior research fellow at Oslo University and editor of African Guerrillas: Raging Against the Machine. &quot;He is generally known as one of the more pragmatic figures, more interested in filling his own pockets than fighting jihad.&quot; The key role cigarettes play in facilitating terrorism has been inexplicably ignored. But it has become of urgent interest to western intelligence agencies as they seek to check al-Qaida&apos;s diverse factions operating across the Saharan region.     Source: UNODC 2009. Credit: Observer graphics    Indeed, after interviewing numerous agents and experts in the field, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has concluded that &quot;cigarette smuggling has provided the bulk of financing for AQIM&quot;. AQIM&apos;s affiliates include Ansar al-Sharia, an offshoot blamed for the killing of the American ambassador, Chris Stevens, in Benghazi, Libya, last year, and was thought to be behind threats last week that prompted the Foreign Office to urge Britons to leave the city. The total value of the illicit tobacco trade in north Africa is thought to exceed $1bn (\u00a3632m). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that Africans smoke 400bn cigarettes a year, of which 60bn are bought on the black market. However, five countries \u2013 Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 smoke 44% of Africa&apos;s cigarettes, and their black markets are significantly larger. More than three-quarters of all cigarettes smoked in Libya, for example, are illicit. Controlling the flow of contraband into these counties has triggered a turf war as Belmokhtar and other AQIM factions compete with each other, as well as with Tuareg tribes and corrupt army and government officials, in an attempt to &quot;own&quot; the trade. Some of the cigarettes transported across Saharan Africa are fakes produced in China and Vietnam. But most are genuine branded product, sourced through the Middle East and shipped through a multitude of countries via a Byzantine network of middle-men and companies, many in offshore tax havens. The cigarettes often enter west Africa through Ghana, Benin and Togo. A second route is via Guinea, where the supply, according to UNODC, vastly exceeds the country&apos;s demand. The cigarettes are then moved to Mali by road or by boat on the Niger river, where there is little risk of detection. A third distribution hub \u2013 for Senegal, Morocco and Algeria \u2013 is provided by Mauritania. In each case, Mr Marlboro and AQIM clean up, either by charging a &quot;tax&quot; for the safe passage of the cigarettes along the salt route, or facilitating their transport, using 4x4s, trucks, motorcycles and even bicycles. Often the smuggled products are not a premium western brand, such as Marlboro, but one of the cheaper, less prestigious marques that the tobacco giants are keen to introduce to developing nations as a way of gaining a foothold in their markets. Inevitably, the endemic smuggling of cigarettes in such countries has raised questions about the role played by big tobacco, and in particular the extent to which it should be made responsible for distribution routes being used to fill the coffers of some of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the world. Internal company memos show that in the 1980s British American Tobacco in Africa used a Liechtenstein-based company, Sorepex, as a key distributor. BAT documents reveal that the company saw Sorepex as a &quot;gravy train&quot; and a way of providing &quot;cover, albeit increasingly flimsy, for BAT in some fairly shady business&quot;. The company insists that it condemns all forms of smuggling. In 2002, RJ Reynolds, owner of the Winston brand, was accused by the EU of selling its products in Iraq in breach of embargoes. The cigarettes were allegedly smuggled into the country by the PKK (Kurdish Workers&apos; party), named by the American government as a terrorist group. Documents allegedly revealed that the cigarettes were transported from the US and shipped to Spain and then to Cyprus and Turkey before arriving in Iraq. The case is currently before a federal appeal court in the US. More recently, Japan Tobacco confirmed last year that it is being investigated by the EU amid claims it broke sanctions by shipping cigarettes to a firm linked to the Syrian regime. The company has denied any wrongdoing. Experts say that the profits provided by cigarette smuggling fuel other criminal activities, including drug, oil and human trafficking, activities which often use the same distribution networks. But cigarettes remain the most profitable and least risky form of contraband. As Louise Shelley, a crime expert at Washington&apos;s George Mason university, told the ICIJ: &quot;No one thinks that cigarette smuggling is too serious, so law enforcement agencies don&apos;t spend resources to go after it.&quot; This helps explain why terrorist groups exploit the illicit trade. According to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the IRA made as much as $100m between 1999 and 2004 by smuggling cigarettes into Northern Ireland. Hezbollah ran a successful smuggling operation in the US, shipping cigarettes from low-tax North Carolina to higher- tax Michigan. &quot;Tobacco smuggling is lucrative and widespread,&quot; said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health. &quot;It helps to fund global terrorism and conflict, encourages corruption and remains a source of funds for some of the most repressive regimes in the world.&quot; Intelligence experts told the Observer that pushing illicit cigarettes into north Africa was at the &quot;low end&quot; of cigarette smuggling. The real money, they said, comes from shipping big-brand products back into Europe via Greece, Spain or sometimes Italy. So far, this is believed to be a small but growing market for the smugglers. While there is no suggestion that the tobacco giants are actively working with terrorist groups, monitoring where their products end up is extremely difficult. The companies&apos; use of well-connected middlemen makes tracing their cigarettes almost impossible. Documents shared with the Observer by intelligence experts show how one middleman, who regularly buys product from a major tobacco company, has a complex operation involving offices, warehouses and bank accounts in Cyprus, Brussels, Dubai, Malaysia, Egypt, Israel, Uruguay, Panama and Singapore that allows him to move cigarettes around the world without being traced. &quot;Those providing &apos;protection&apos; along the routes \u2013 often customs officers or security services, but in some instances &apos;terrorists&apos; \u2013 make good money for little or no work,&quot; said one intelligence expert who has worked in counter-smuggling operations. &quot;What&apos;s best for them is that the trade is either in US dollars or euros. It&apos;s hard currency into clean accounts which they can then use at their leisure to buy whatever they need.&quot; Experts want countries to ratify the international treaty on the illicit trade in tobacco that would force cigarette companies to monitor and trace the distribution of their products while conducting due diligence on their customers. &quot;The only way you can effectively police this is if the manufacturers accept legal responsibility for their products all along the chain of supply \u2013 that will force them to deal with reputable agents,&quot; said Eric LeGresley, a Canadian lawyer who has studied tobacco companies. Ironically, Belmokhtar may have been too successful at smuggling cigarettes. It is rumoured that late last year he was forced out of AQIM and his base in Mali after the organisation&apos;s leaders questioned his commitment to their cause. Mr Marlboro, they suggested, was more interested in money than ideals. The slaughter in the Sahara may have been Belmokhtar&apos;s grotesque attempt to prove them wrong, something that has huge consequences for his smuggling operations. &quot;His days as a smuggler are over,&quot; B\u00f8\u00e5s predicted. &quot;No bandits or traders will want to be within a kilometre of him now. They don&apos;t want to be targeted by American drones.&quot; But, given the money at stake, there will be no shortage of others ready to take his place. Tobacco and Terrorism The Taliban Across the tribal belt of Pakistan, Taliban militias collect money from cigarette smugglers in exchange for allowing counterfeit Marlboro and cheap local brands into Afghanistan and China. Cigarettes have become an increasingly important source of financing for the groups, second only to the heroin trade, according to Pakistani intelligence officials. The PKK Charges a fee for every container of cigarettes allowed to pass through its territory. Controlled the flow of contraband cigarettes into Iraq during the 1990s; now controls the flood of counterfeit cigarettes out of the same country. Farc The world&apos;s largest supplier of cocaine often uses its well established drug smuggling routes to move American cigarettes according to evidence given to the US Senate. The CNDP In 2008, the UN claimed that The Congres National Pour la Defense du Peuple, a Tutsi-backed rebel group accused of atrocities, was being funded by Tribert Rujugiro Ayabatwa, a tobacco tycoon who pleaded guilty to cigarette tax evasion charges in South Africa.

Migrating that way thrashes all your plans and dreams \u2013 albeit temporarily, if you are willing to rebuild your future at all cost. After settling in the contrastingly safe and secure Netherlands, I decided to simply shape my future and fulfil the dreams I had as a child, studying engineering at university. I have been here for nearly two decades. My connection with those back &quot;home&quot; is threefold; sending remittance to relatives in the horn of Africa is probably familiar to many, the connection with those left back in Somalia is very strong.

Economic and family/personal reasons.&mdash; Riya de los Reyes (@riyadelosreyes) January 18, 2013    My family moved from the Philippines to Singapore in 1998. My father&apos;s job was based in Singapore and my parents wanted the family to stay together. I remembered being informed of our departure less than two weeks before our flight. I was stunned, frightened and reluctant to leave. We left the Philippines partly because we did not have good relations with our extended families. We did not feel &quot;at home&quot; in the only home we had ever known. This made settling down in Singapore &quot;easier&quot; but it left us with little desire to sustain personal connections back home. Almost two decades of living away from our country of origin entailed personal struggles in coming to terms with our &quot;foreigner&quot; status and the isolated, insecure life we lived in Singapore. My parents took a gamble and made sacrifices \u2026 and the process enriched our lives in more ways than the improvement of our economic wellbeing. My sister and I are/were first-generation university students. I hope my migration experience leads to better understanding of people who chose to leave their previous lives behind.

My father was a petrochemical engineer and teacher. He migrated to the USSR to undertake his doctorate and like many Ghanaians, emigrated to sparsely populated Libya to work in the petroleum industry. There was a strong demand for migrant labour and skills \u2026 and it was a magnet for us. I came to the UK when I was around seven years old and settled here after my father&apos;s work finished in Libya. Why UK? We already had established family in Manchester and London since the late 70s. My father had previously been to the UK and knew the country well. Remittances are an important factor in our lives, from the odd family emergency to school fees or cousins in Ghana. The proliferation of Money Transfers and Western Unions are no joke. With these remittances, we have been able to establish internet back home so regular Skype and Facebook sessions have become the norm. I consider Manchester home now because that&apos;s where my parents are. I still have fond memories of Libya but it is Manchester that I really know and Ghana that I have recently become acquainted with as an adult. What about the future? Who knows?

This resulted in us uprooting and moving to Zimbabwe, where I spent six years. I had grandparents and all of my mother&apos;s siblings living in the United States, where they had received asylum in the 80s. It was through them that we applied to get green cards. I was 15 when I moved to Atlanta, GA. I am now a US citizen and although I doubt I will move back to live full-time in Ethiopia, my experiences have all had a tremendous impact on the direction of my life and career. I work in international development and Africa is a continent that is and will always be close to my heart. On average, I have returned to Ethiopia once every two to three years to visit extended family and will continue to do so. I would also very much like to invest as a diaspora (not just through remittances), in development projects or private businesses.

I returned to Burma twice: in 1988 when the democracy movement started and again in 2008 when Aung San Suu Kyi was under house arrest. I am grateful that my parents decided to emigrate; I cannot imagine what life would be like if we hadn&apos;t. I went to English international schools with expatriate children so I grew up with people from different backgrounds. Multiculturalism was normal to me and I felt very much like any other Chinese kid growing up in Hong Kong. I was offered a place to study medicine in Sheffield. England was a culture shock: I did not understand why shops shut early and &quot;the pub&quot; is so integral to social life: 22 years later, I feel as &quot;British&quot; as any immigrant can be. I have subscribed to the values of British society and the NHS \u2026 I have had my share of racist remarks directed at me; I have learned to ignore them.

There is undoubtedly material for more or less any argument from the different studies: the most recent 65-nation Pisa study, conducted by the OECD, put England 23rd in reading, 27th in maths and 16th in science; data from the Amsterdam-based International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) put England 11th out of 45 nations for reading, with similar rankings for maths and science; while a newer league table by the Economist Intelligence Unit for publisher Pearson had England 6th of 40 nations. A study for the leading educational charity the Sutton Trust, carried out Professor Alan Smithers from Buckingham university, noted that some tables omitted countries deemed ahead of England elsewhere while others used data, for example on university graduation, not considered elsewhere. Small and effectively meaningless differences in raw data could still shift ranking positions and that different tables, it added. &quot;Global education tables have become an increasingly important tool in the political debate in Britain as well as in other developed nations. But league table rankings are not always what they seem, hence the see-sawing in the rankings that we have seen over the years,&quot; said Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust However, Smithers did find that once the differences were removed the main tables gave broadly similar results, with England generally out-performed by a small number of nations such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, and consistently by the East Asian nations, which traditionally top such rankings.

On an April morning in 2002 I was a young reporter working for an Indian news portal and writing frequently about the wartorn Indian-controlled Kashmir, where I grew up. Reporting from a place like Kashmir was a fraught exercise, walking through a minefield of words and their consequences. I found a mentor in an older Kashmiri reporter, who had already been witnessing and reporting the horrors of our land for more than a decade. He would sit behind one of those first generation PCs in a semi-dark newspaper room, and between sips of tea and puffs of cigarette smoke tell me the stories of Kashmir. I owe him a large part of my political education, my sense of writing from the field. One afternoon in April 2002, I was in his office when the news came of a young Kashmiri girl being raped in a small village in the southern mountains of Kashmir by Indian paramilitary soldiers. A tense silence followed. I wanted to leave immediately for that village; it was an hour from my ancestral village in south Kashmir. I could take a cab and get there and write the story. My friend smoked another cigarette and sighed. His memories of reporting similar cases filled the room. &quot;Justice is rare here. Hardly any soldier gets tried and punished in a court of law for such crimes,&quot; he said. He had a wide range of contacts in the local civil service and police and by the evening he had enough details to file a report about the incident for his newspaper. Only later, I understood his reluctance to travel to her village. It was painful even in your detached role as a journalist; my friend had been to innumerable sites of atrocities. But I was young and earnest and I was determined to visit her village. &quot;Go in the morning,&quot; he said. Travelling in the evening was dangerous in Kashmir; people stayed home after sunset. Nobody wanted to be mistaken for a militant by the Indian troops and fired upon; nobody wanted to be detained at a check post. &quot;Be careful with your story. It is not safe to be seen by the government as a reporter who is launching a human rights campaign against the troops.&quot; I had a fair sense of that. Censorship in Kashmir could take the form of threatening phone calls, and in the worst cases, assassination and attempts at assassination. In the very beginning, in 1989, as the war began in Kashmir, Mohammed Azam Inquilabi, a senior separatist who later became leader of a militant outfit, sent a bullet with a letter asking local editors to change &quot;as the times have changed&quot;. In February 1990, separatist militants assassinated Lassa Koul, the director of the Kashmir office of Doordarshan, the television network owned and run by the Indian government. Koul belonged to the minority Pandit or Kashmiri Hindu community, and assassinations of its prominent members like Koul scared the community and led to the displacement of around 300,000 Pandits from the Kashmir Valley to scores of towns and cities in India. A year later, in April 1991, Mohammad Shaban Vakeel, the editor of a widely circulated Urdu daily, Al-Safa, was killed in his office by unidentified assassins. One of the few reliable sources of information in the bloody early-90s Kashmir was the BBC World Service. Yusuf Jameel, its much-respected correspondent, survived several assassination attempts. One afternoon in 1995, an unknown woman dropped a packet addressed to Jameel at his office. Jameel was on the phone and his friend, Mushtaq Ali, a video journalist with an Indian news agency, Asian News International, opened the parcel. The bomb went off. Three days later, Ali died of injuries. By the mid-90s, Ikhwanis, a group of counter-insurgents working for the Indian army, routinely kidnapped, threatened and humiliated reporters and editors. Jameel is certain the bomb that killed his friend was made by an Indian Army major and planted at his office through the Ikhwanis. &quot;They had exhausted all other ways, threats, offers, and whatnot. They wanted to kill me. When I survived they pressurised BBC to throw me out,&quot; Jameel told the Srinagar-based Kashmir Life magazine last year. In the past few years, as the insurgency in Kashmir has waned and been replaced by a series of mass protests, new forms of censorship have arrived. The most effective is the political economy of patronage; small, provincial newspapers depend a lot on the advertisements from the government, and although several papers maintained their integrity despite publishing official advertisements over the years, the provision of advertisements has come to be implicitly tied to sanitised reporting. But let&apos;s return to that April day in 2002, when my friend advised me to be careful. I did not travel at night and left Srinagar early that morning in a taxi for the raped girl&apos;s village. We drove for three hours through scores of checkposts, past military convoys rumbling down the roads, and up a dirt road into a tiny village of small cottages circled by high mountains. I interviewed the girl and her relatives, returned to Srinagar and wrote a report. I was still struggling to teach myself to write; yet by the standards of a newspaper, it wasn&apos;t bad. The tone was a little harsh, but the piece was never printed. I never heard back from my editor. My friend laughed: &quot;It happens all the time.&quot; Last month in the Indian capital, New Delhi, a 23-year-old student was gang raped in a moving bus. After a few weeks in multiple hospitals, she died while being treated in Singapore. The shock of the brutality brought thousands of protesters to the streets in Delhi. A bumbling government eventually responded by setting up a judicial commission to review India&apos;s laws on sexual assault. The commission, headed by a former Supreme Court of India chief justice, Justice JS Verma, made a series of important recommendations. One of the more important ones was to repeal a law called Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which provides complete impunity to Indian soldiers and policemen posted in zones of conflict, like Kashmir and Manipur. Justice Verma has recommended appealing the AFSPA to exclude the soldiers and policemen from impunity regarding crimes of sexual assault in such zones of exception. We don&apos;t know yet if the Indian parliament will accept the recommendation. As the commission deliberated, a lawyer friend who was trying to write to the Verma Commission asked me about cases of sexual assault in Kashmir. I ran a search in my email and an old, censored, unpublished story \u2013 the account of the girl who was raped in Kashmir in April 2002 \u2013 surfaced from a folder. I read it after 11 years and was carried back to a younger self, a darker time. A writer shall publish when he can and I can&apos;t think of a better rebuke to the cultures of censorship than to share with you that story. I am inclined to reproduce it here in its original form, but will paraphrase it. The village of Kuller in Anantnag district of India-controlled Kashmir is home to a few hundred families of semi-nomadic Gujjar shepherds. Indian troops routinely patrolled and searched the village, looking for separatist militants. The villagers, living in mud and brick cottages, farmed and raised cattle to eke out a living \u2013 often travelling to higher pastures in summers with their flocks of cattle. Zainab, a 17-year-old girl, was home on that April 2002 morning. She had never been to school and was helping her mother with household chores. A group of soldiers from India&apos;s Border Security Force, stationed nearby, passed through the village, questioning the villagers about militants. Her uncle Ghulam Hasan had returned to the village after an errand. He sat by a walnut tree in their courtyard and played with his three-year-old daughter. It was 11 in the morning. Yet another group of 16 BSF men arrived. The group commander walked up to Hasan, and demanded his identity card. Hasan duly produced the card, following the imperative to prove his identity. &quot;As I was showing my identity card, some money fell from my pocket and I bent to pick it up. The next moment the BSF officer started beating me up,&quot; Hasan told me. The soldiers formed a circle around his house. His neighbours looked on helplessly; the BSF men pointed their guns towards them. Hasan struggled to save his child from injury, as the officer hit him. His sister shouted and tried to rescue him. Her daughter, Zainab, who was inside the house, rushed out to help her uncle. As she stepped out of the door, three soldiers carrying assault rifles pushed her back and forced their way into the house. One of them hit her in the stomach with his gun; she fell on the floor. They bolted the door. &quot;They raped me taking turns. Then I lost my senses,&quot; Zainab told me after much effort. Half an hour later, her family found her unconscious, bleeding. &quot;She was lying unconscious on the floor,&quot; Abdullah, her cousin, who witnessed the crime from the adjoining house, told me. &quot;They had torn her clothes. She was bleeding from her mouth.&quot; Hasan carried her on his back through dirt roads to the nearest hospital. A police officer I met a few days later told me she had identified the perpetrators and they had been arrested. But they couldn&apos;t be tried in a civil court, shielded as they were by the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. Zainab seemed to have shrunken, when I met her. When she slept, her nightmares woke her up. I remember the intense sadness of her black eyes, the slow movement of her parched lips, and her last words to me: &quot;If they are punished, it will deter others. Maybe some other woman would be saved.&quot; I lost track of her. Zainab and her family had left her village out of shame and moved elsewhere. I don&apos;t know what happened to those soldiers either. Eleven years later, I still feel the regret that I had failed to stop her story from being censored. \u2022 Basharat Peer is the author of Curfewed Night, an award-winning account of the Kashmir conflict. \u2022 This keynote was commissioned by British Council India for the Edinburgh World Writers&apos; Conference: Jaipur.

The December attack in the Indian capital provoked outrage and widespread protests calling for legal and policing reforms as well as a shift in cultural attitudes. Five defendants aged between 19 and 34 formally entered not guilty pleas to charges of murder and rape last weekend. If convicted they are likely to face execution. A sixth individual, aged 17 at the time of the crime, will face separate proceedings. The Indian government issued directives last weekend tightening the laws on sexual crimes and implementing other recommendations of a judicial commission set up in the aftermath of the attack. Penalties for sexual assault stopping short of rape and for a range of other crimes have been increased. Previously, serious sexual harassment was treated as a relatively minor crime with few offenders prosecuted.     Mourners pay tribute to the victim at a makeshift shrine in Delhi. Photograph: Louis Dowse/Demotix/Corbis    The new measures have been welcomed by some campaigners, though many say they do not go far enough. &quot;These are piecemeal. We need something comprehensive that tackles the root of the problem,&quot; said Vrinda Grover, a senior lawyer and activist. Ministers say the directive is an emergency measure and further legislation will be introduced in parliament as soon as possible. The specially established &quot;fast-track&quot; court in south Delhi where hearings on the December attack are taking place will begin hearing prosecution evidence on Tuesday. The police have prepared a 600-page dossier and will call dozens of witnesses. Lawyers for the men told the Guardian that a fair trial was &quot;impossible&quot;. Prosecution documents seen by the Guardian describe in detail the attack, which took place in a moving bus on busy public roads in the capital. The victim, a physiotherapy student, and her 28-year-old friend were returning from a cinema in a shopping centre when they boarded the bus after being offered a ride home at about 8.30 on a Sunday evening. The assault began within minutes and lasted an hour before the pair were dumped, naked and bleeding heavily, on a roadside near the international airport. The woman had suffered massive internal injuries from an iron bar used by the accused, the documents claim. She died in a clinic in Singapore two weeks later. MK Sharma, representing one of the accused, has said several of the men were tortured by police and in prison, and any statements they have given to the police are &quot;worthless&quot;. Other defence lawyers say their clients have been wrongly identified. &quot;It is not simply a case of innocent until proven guilty but is there even any evidence to bring a case at all,&quot; Sharma said. Police have said they will rely on DNA evidence to prove the charges and the possession by the accused of the victims&apos; property. According to the prosecution documents, one of the accused kept a ring and a mobile phone taken from the woman during the attack; a second kept the more expensive phone stolen from her friend as well as his shoes; a third took a watch and cash worth 1,000 rupees (\u00a312); the 17-year-old received a bank card and 1,100 rupees (\u00a313.20), the documents claim. Police officials say the sharing of the property indicates the crime was &quot;not spur of the moment&quot;. One said several of the men were in the habit of taking the bus for &quot;joyrides&quot; on Sunday evenings, during which they would entice people aboard and then rob them. The money would then be used to pick up roadside sex workers. The dossier indicates the police recovered one of the victims&apos; bank cards from the bus in which the assault is alleged to have occurred, which was parked close to the homes of the accused. One, the alleged ringleader who drove the bus for a living, was found by officers sitting in the vehicle two days after the attack. There was evidence that its interior had been recently washed though bloodstains and other traces remained. Sharma said the evidence had been planted.     Hundreds of anti-rape demonstrators march in New Delhi in January. Photograph: Anindito Mukherjee/EPA    The Indian government was heavily criticised for its slow response to the crime and police handling of demonstrations in the centre of Delhi calling for better policing and legal reforms. In response, a former chief justice was asked to compile a list of measures to stem the rising tide of sex crime in India. He handed in his report last month after receiving tens of thousands of suggestions from the public. In addition to the new definitions and greater punishments for sexual harassment, new offences have been introduced to cover crimes such as stalking. However, the government rejected advice that marital rape be outlawed, judicial immunity for members of the armed forces serving in some areas be ended and that members of parliament charged with rape and other serious crimes be forced to resign, which has disappointed many. &quot;To combat sexual violence you need accountability at all levels. But the citadels of impunity are all intact,&quot; Grover said. Other campaigners point out that tightening laws has little effect when implementation on the ground is patchy. The Delhi incident led to broad introspection in India about how women are treated in a society where a transition from traditional conservative social attitudes is generating great tensions. For several weeks, incidents of rapes, which once would rarely have been reported, received prominent coverage. In recent days, however, the level of coverage has dropped off.

Ralf Mutschke, Fifa&apos;s head of security and a former Interpol official, said: &quot;Match-fixing and match-manipulation is a global problem and is not going to go away tomorrow.&quot; He argued that although &quot;a member of the football family&quot; can be given a life ban by Fifa, &quot;for people outside of football, the custodial sentences are too weak, and offer little to deter someone from getting involved in match-fixing&quot;. An unidentified European Champions League tie played in England &quot;within the last three to four years&quot; is one of the matches under investigation, Rob Wainwright, the director of Europol, said. While the &quot;focus&quot; of the investigation is not on England, Wainwright said: &quot;Given the scale of corruption involved, it would be naive and complacent to think that the criminal conspiracy does not affect the English game.&quot; The Football Association said that while it takes &quot;matters of integrity in football extremely seriously&quot;, Europol had not informed the FA of its suspicions about the Champions League tie. &quot;The FA [is] not aware of any credible reports into suspicious Champions League fixtures in England, nor has any information been shared with us,&quot; an FA spokesman said. More than 380 football matches in Europe are under investigation for match-fixing, Europol said, including top-flight domestic league matches and qualifiers in the European Championship and World Cup. In addition, some 300 matches in Africa, Asia, South and Central America are suspected of having been fixed by &quot;an extensive criminal network&quot;. Europol said 425 people from more than 15 countries are suspected of being involved in attempts to fix the 380 matches played at different levels of professional football across Europe. Those under suspicion include players, match officials, club staff and &quot;serious criminals&quot;. Europol calculated that more than \u20ac8m (\u00a36.8m) in betting profits had been corruptly made, with in excess of \u20ac2m in &quot;corrupt payments&quot; made to football people. &quot;This is a sad day for European football and more evidence of the corrupting influence in society of organised crime,&quot; Wainwright said. &quot;This is match-fixing on a scale we&apos;ve not seen before, involving hundreds of criminals and corrupted officials and players, affecting hundreds of professional matches and generating very large amounts of illicit profits. It is the work of a sophisticated international organised crime syndicate based in Asia and working with criminal facilitators around Europe.&quot; Some of the cases have been prosecuted, while others remain the subject of continued investigation. Following an investigation by prosecutors in Bochum, Germany, 14 people were convicted of match-fixing, and received prison sentences totalling 39 years. Andreas Bachmann, of the Bochum prosecution service, said that 20 further arrest warrants have been issued, along with 86 search warrants for premises in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. He said the \u20ac2m Europol has calculated to have been paid in bribes should be assumed to be &quot;only the tip of the iceberg&quot;. Laszlo Angeli, from the central investigative chief prosecutor&apos;s office in Hungary, referred to a friendly between Argentina and Bolivia as one of the matches under suspicion. Europol has had an investigation team, codenamed operation Veto, running since July 2011 to share information among EU countries, and is co-operating with Interpol for the matches under suspicion outside Europe. The agency alleges that the betting gangs are based in Asia \u2013 the Bochum investigation found the operation was run from Singapore \u2013 and associates were required to bribe the football people involved. Investigations are also ongoing into alleged laundering of the proceeds in tax havens. &quot;All those responsible for running football should heed the warnings,&quot; Wainwright said. Fifa said that it is committed to tackling match-fixing, and aside from calling for tougher penalties also urged stronger co-operation between sporting bodies and law enforcement agencies. Wainwright said he will be providing Michel Platini, the Uefa president, with details of the investigation, although Europol did not identify the allegedly suspicious Champions League tie, or any other match or person subject to investigation. &quot;Uefa is already co-operating with the authorities on these serious matters as part of its zero tolerance policy towards match-fixing,&quot; Uefa said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/feb/05/the-wombles-at-40", "sentences": ["Apart from the Singapore Wombles, who can and often do eat their dinners off the city&apos;s pavements, so clean is it there."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-05T18:08:18Z", "title": "The Wombles at 40 \u2013 why we need them more than ever", "tags": ["The Wombles", "Television", "Children's TV", "Recycling", "Culture"], "article": "Who would win a fight between a Womble and a Teletubby? Why\u00a0did the Wombles&apos; 1970s mission to teach a nation not to litter fail so abjectly? How did they, as Marvin Gaye would put it, get it on? Forget about the wonders of the ice age: as the Wombles of Wimbledon Common celebrate their 40th birthday, these are the questions that need answering. Let&apos;s tackle the first question. Obviously your Teletubby, while having much the same BMI as your mature Womble, is bigger and thus more terrifying in a smackdown scenario. That said, the former&apos;s gaudy colour scheme (Tinky Winky purple, Laa-Laa yellow) would make a surprise attack unlikely on even a very slow-witted Womble (I&apos;m thinking of Tomsk, who has the lowest womble IQ and, as axiomatically follows, likes golf). Plus, because each Teletubby contains a sweating actor who&apos;s going to sack their agent as soon as they get out of their fur suit, they aren&apos;t exactly going to chase down their preys like cheetahs. Wombles are stuffed, and have no such motivational issues. Wombles, unlike Teletubbies, have vicious little eyes and snouts that suggest powerful teeth \u2013 both good in a scrap. They also have retractable claws, decisive in close combat \u2013 and definitive proof that 1970s kids&apos; TV is better than today&apos;s. Wikipedia puts about the nonsense\u00a0that wombles are raccoons. Do raccoons wear scarfs, spectacles and\u00a0hats? Aren&apos;t raccoons, in fact, known for tipping up bins rather than\u00a0initiating community-wide, proto-recycling initiatives? A\u00a0Womble&apos;s\u00a0life span, unlike a raccoon&apos;s, may be as long as 300 years (the Womble song Minuetto Allegretto refers to Great Uncle Bulgaria as being a lad in 1780: you do the maths). This may explain how Great Uncle Bulgaria beat Britain&apos;s fascistic immigration system. Long-lived, species-non-specific stuffed animals rarely require\u00a0visas, even when travelling from outside the EU.            Reading on mobile? Click here to watch video  The great tragedy of the Wombles is\u00a0that their mission to make Britain tidier now looks like a sick joke. The concept was dreamed up in 1968 by the\u00a0late children&apos;s author Elisabeth Beresford, and later adapted for TV by\u00a0means of Ivor Wood&apos;s brilliant stop-motion animation, an adorable Bernard Cribbins&apos; narration and Mike Batt&apos;s undying theme music. It is as laughable as the Keep Britain Tidy campaign. Think of how last month&apos;s snow encouraged some dog owners to believe they had a free pass to let their pets befoul the pavements, rather in the way that Mike Batt&apos;s Wombling Merry Christmas befouled the singles chart in December 1974. Actually, that&apos;s unfair: there was much worse stuff (Mud&apos;s Lonely This Christmas, for one). Did the Wombles clean up their own mess? A rhetorical question: of course they did! When they went for a walk, Tobermory would lead the way, followed by Orinoco, who carried a bag for Tobermory&apos;s waste, followed by Bungo, who was tasked with bagging Orinoco&apos;s. Tomsk, Wellington, Madame Cholet, Stepney and even Cousin Cairngorm McWomble the Terrible would follow in orderly fashion. Otherwise, Wimbledon Common would have become a vast Womble latrine. Who bagged Tobermory&apos;s waste? We may never know. The selflessness and communal bonds that the Wombles demonstrated weekly from 1973 to 1975, the basic respect they urged for our streets, commons, one another and by extension, the planet, are widely missing from our age. We need Wombles in 2013 \u2013 but where are they? The likely truth is that the Wombles have retreated underground for good, never again to shake their snouts at the\u00a0overground mess we have made.

The 28-year-old software engineer, the prosecution&apos;s star witness, appeared in court in a wheelchair, still bearing the scars of injuries from the attack. The December attack in the Indian capital provoked outrage and widespread protests calling for legal and policing reforms as well as a shift in cultural attitudes. The five accused include a bus driver, a cleaner, a gym assistant and a fruit seller. All have pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and murder. If\u00a0convicted they face the death penalty. A sixth accused is being tried separately as a juvenile. Police say the six attacked the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist and her friend after enticing them aboard a bus as the couple returned home from watching a movie at a mall on December 16. The woman was repeatedly raped and repeatedly penetrated with at least one metal bar. The couple were also severely beaten before being dumped on a roadside near the Indian capital&apos;s international airport. The woman died of massive internal injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks later In his statement to police after the assault, the friend gave a detailed account of events. He said their attackers had asked: &quot;Where are you going with a girl so late at night?&quot; within moments of the couple boarding the bus, before launching a furious assault. Though he tried to protect the woman, he was beaten with a metal rod and restrained while his friend was repeatedly raped. The police &quot;charge sheet&quot; also includes confessions from the accused - which their lawyers say are either inadmissible or made under duress and thus worthless - as well as a statement from the woman, recorded by a magistrate, before she lost consciousness. The prosecution says the accused shared out property stolen from the couple, including their cellphones. About 30 policemen were deployed outside the courtroom as the five accused arrived from the high security wing of Delhi&apos;s Tihar jail wearing scarves or handkerchiefs to mask their faces. As the trial got under way, the victim&apos;s father appeared at a news conference organised by the main opposition Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) to call for his daughter&apos;s attackers to be hanged. There is anger that the juvenile among the accused may escape any lengthy sentence for his role in the attack.

The football authorities here were bemused by Europol&apos;s sudden announcement, but they and Uefa stress they do take the modern threat of match-fixing seriously. The UK&apos;s professional football leagues jointly employ an agency to monitor betting markets around the world for suspicious patterns. Referees or other match officials may be changed before a match if unusual bets are placed, to remove any questions over their integrity. Lower-division matches are more likely to be targeted than those involving the multimillionaire players of the Premier League. Rob Wainwright, Europol&apos;s director, was clearly intent on sounding the alarm over the English game, illustrated by his reference to the unspecified Champions League match played here which he said is under suspicion. Europol has not clarified which match it was, or whether, as reported by the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, Wainwright was referring to Debrecen&apos;s 1-0 defeat at Liverpool in September 2009. Debrecen have confirmed their goalkeeper, Vukasin Poleksic, was questioned by Uefa after he was approached by match-fixers before that Liverpool game. However no action was taken, and there is no ongoing investigation. Who are Europol? A European Union agency whose role is principally to share information between police forces in EU member countries. &quot;Europol officers have no direct powers of arrest but support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analysing and disseminating information and co-ordinating operations,&quot; Europol say of their role. Wainwright said Europol has formed a Joint Investigation Team, codenamed Veto, to coordinate Europe-wide operations against football match-fixing. The investigations by the Bochum police in Germany, which produced the convictions of 14 people in 2011, centred on the Croatian ringleader, Ante Sapina, have been the most successful so far. Many in football believe Europol was seeking to raise their profile by launching this week&apos;s sensational press conference, declaring 380 cases under suspicion in Europe and 300 more around the world. In 2011 Fifa gave Interpol, the international information-sharing agency, \u20ac20m to conduct a 10-year anti-match-fixing training initiative. Europol has no such partnership in football and is financed from the EU community budget; its 2011 budget was \u20ac84.8m. What happens next? Europol said Veto investigations are ongoing, although little further detail was offered. Friedhelm Althans, chief investigator for the Bochum police, said Europol does have evidence for 150 of the 300 matches suspected of being fixed worldwide. The football authorities in the major European leagues, and Uefa, will continue to spend money on anti-match-fixing but, with billions being bet on the Asian markets, their strategies are far from infallible. There is general agreement with Ralf Mutschke, Fifa&apos;s head of security, that more co-operation is needed between law enforcement agencies and the football world. Fifpro, the international footballers&apos; union, points out that match-fixing has been most prevalent in lower divisions and eastern European leagues, where players are poorly paid and often have no written contracts, so are in theory more corruptible. Fifpro is calling for better employment conditions for footballers, and more education and training. Why so relatively little money (for so many fixtures) involved? Europol said that of the 380 matches in Europe, more than \u20ac8m was generated in betting profits and more than \u20ac2m paid in bribes to those involved in fixing the matches. This appeared principally to be made up of the operation uncovered by the Bochum police. The activities of Sapina&apos;s gang did mostly focus on lower division matches in Germany and eastern European countries, where comparatively small amounts of money can be enough to tempt football people. Who is behind this? Althams said the operations now under investigation are run out of Singapore. Europol emphasised that this is an extension of organised crime, so the conspirators can be from anywhere, but there has been a prevalence of Asian involvement. Wilson Raj Perumal, who was identified as the head of a match\u2011fixing operation by organised crime investigators in Finland, is from Singapore. It has been reported that Perumal has disclosed information to Europol which led to its figure of 680 matches being identified. Most of the betting on fixed matches is placed on Asian markets, which are less well regulated, and allow in-match betting on incidents in the games, rather than the results. Singapore police have stated their commitment to co-operating with European forces to counter match-fixing. What are the chances of criminal convictions? Difficult. The Bochum investigation is the prize operation so far, with convictions secured following telephone tapping and surveillance. Finland&apos;s organised crime investigators also scored a success in convicting Perumal and members of his operation. Detecting bribery and corruption is anyway fraught, and proving an official or player acted deliberately to influence a football match is tricky."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/06/royal-bank-scotland-libor-penalties", "sentences": ["John Hourican, the head of the investment bank, is expected to depart with a payoff, although without being blamed for Libor rigging, which has forced the bank to fire four individuals and face legal action in Singapore from one of those dismissed.", "Documents filed in a Singapore court by a former RBS trader, Tan Chi Min, who is bringing a case of wrongful dismissal on the basis that the bank condoned the manipulation of Libor, illustrate the type of exchanges."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-06T08:37:00Z", "title": "Royal Bank of Scotland expects 'significant' Libor penalties", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Libor", "Vince Cable", "Banking", "Business", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland has warned the stock market it faces &quot;significant penalties&quot; and other sanctions from regulators in the UK and the US for its role in rigging Libor. The bailed-out bank is expected to announce on Wednesday it will pay fines of about \u00a3400m and admit to criminal charges in its Asian division as part of a long-awaited settlement over the manipulation of the key benchmark rate. As the business secretary, Vince Cable, raised questions about the future ownership of the bank, RBS was forced to issue a stock market statement in which it promised &quot;all pertinent issues&quot; related to Libor would be announced shortly. &quot;RBS confirms that it is in late-stage settlement discussions with these authorities. Although the settlements remain to be agreed, RBS expects they will include the payment of significant penalties as well as certain other sanctions,&quot; the bank, more than 80% owned by the taxpayer, said. John Hourican, the head of the investment bank, is expected to depart with a payoff, although without being blamed for Libor rigging, which has forced the bank to fire four individuals and face legal action in Singapore from one of those dismissed. Cable and George Osborne want certainty from RBS that the portion of the fine being paid to US regulators will come from the pay of RBS bankers. Some \u00a3300m is expected to be handed to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the department of justice in the US with about \u00a388m being paid to the Financial Services Authority in the UK. Cable, in a speech on Wednesday, will discuss the future of ownership of RBS, which he has called for debate about a range of options from full nationalisation to a share distribution to taxpayers as outlined by the Liberal Democrats in the past. &quot;For the existing semi-state-owned companies, there is a range of options, from reprivatisation at a later stage to continued public ownership or mutualisation through public share distribution, as advocated by the Liberal Democrats. We should keep all of these options in play,&quot; Cable will say. In an interview with the Guardian before the speech, he said: &quot;I was an advocate for nationalising the bank but we are where we are. We&apos;ve inherited this unsatisfactory situation, which is worst of all worlds, where we&apos;re responsible but we don&apos;t have control where we can direct it. It is unsatisfactory,&quot; he said. But he conceded that for now, the RBS problem &quot;had to be parked&quot;. Cable later told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme there was &quot;no immediate prospect&quot; of handing RBS shares to 46 million voters in a scheme first raised in 2011 \u2013 but said the options should be kept &quot;alive&quot;. When the RBS settlements are announced on Wednesday, regulators are expected to publish electronic exchanges between traders attempting to manipulate Libor. Documents filed in a Singapore court by a former RBS trader, Tan Chi Min, who is bringing a case of wrongful dismissal on the basis that the bank condoned the manipulation of Libor, illustrate the type of exchanges. First reported by Bloomberg in September, the 231 pages of filings show Tan sent an instant message in April 2008, saying: &quot;Nice Libor \u2026 our six-month fixing moved the entire fixing hahaha.&quot; In other messages he describes Libor as a &quot;cartel&quot; and discusses how a hedge fund will be &quot;kissing&quot; another trader if the rate can be brought down, evoking memories of the promises by Barclays&apos;s Libor traders to deliver bottles of Bollinger champagne for shifting the rate.

A long delayed decision from the Department for Education is expected in the next fortnight on the future funding of school sport, after the education secretary, Michael Gove, cut \u00a3162m in funding for a national network of school sports partnerships in December 2010. The government was forced into a partial U-turn by an outpouring of anger from teachers, students and athletes, but \u00a365m in ringfenced funding for the release of PE specialists into primary schools runs out at the end of this academic year. The Guardian revealed in December that an announcement over school sport had been delayed by a government split over whether new funding for primary schools would be ringfenced for sport or, as Gove prefers, left to the discretion of individual headteachers. Gove is believed to have won the argument over the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and others and the funding is not expected to be formally ringfenced, although it may come with a recommendation that it is spent on PE. &quot;I know there are a lot of other things going on, and I don&apos;t want to overhype school sport, but I believe this is a pivotal moment to deliver what Seb [Coe] promised,&quot; said Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust and UK Sport. &quot;To me, &apos;inspire a generation&apos; meant to get hold of a generation and create a new beginning for physical education and school sport. This announcement is pivotal in terms of school sport.&quot; Jonathan Edwards, Olympic gold medallist and London 2012 board member, told the Youth Sport Trust&apos;s annual conference in Telford that the decision to scrap the school sports partnerships was a disgrace. &quot;It is dripping with irony that we have just celebrated the greatest Olympic Games ever, which started from the inspiration of school sport in this country when [founder of the modern Games] Pierre de Coubertin came over [in 1883], and that we&apos;re sitting having this conversation now is utterly depressing,&quot; he said. &quot;If you&apos;d told me in Singapore when we won the bid in 2005 that this is what would happen, I would not have believed you.&quot; Primary and secondary headteachers voiced fears that Gove&apos;s concentration purely on academic performance and the introduction of the E-bacc, combined with the drive to increase competition between schools, would lead to a fractured landscape for PE and school sport. &quot;I think Gove has got to start valuing the teachers. They want to make the difference to those children. Some haven&apos;t had the training to be able to do that and he has to start investing in people to start higher quality PE coming through,&quot; said Tony Draper, headteacher at Water Hall primary school in Bletchley and a National Association of Headteachers executive. &quot;We need to invest in primary PE specialists that will be able to train staff in schools and end up with a long term sustainable infrastructure.&quot; They are particularly concerned that primary schools will not get the help and support to make the most of whatever money is announced and that many may spend it on other things. Most primary teachers only get six hours of training in PE and lack the skills and expertise necessary, they said. &quot;The heads who are here get it. It is the hundreds who are not here that worry me. Sport, physical well being and health is not a choice. We can&apos;t decide whether we want healthy children, it&apos;s an obligation. We can&apos;t decide whether we want physically literate children, it&apos;s an obligation,&quot; said Campbell. She said that if PE and competitive sport were seen as interchangeable, there was a danger that the former could end up being axed from the school curriculum altogether in the future. &quot;Of course we want academic achievement. We&apos;re not trying to compete with that, we&apos;re saying this underpins that. This isn&apos;t something you do after the serious business of education, this is the serious business of education.

Tracey McDermott, the FSA&apos;s enforcement director, said some bankers had decided &quot;the rules did not apply to them&quot;\u00a0and that another five financial firms, including banks and inter-dealer brokers,\u00a0remained under investigation as part of the\u00a0on-going inquiry into the rigging of Libor, which is used\u00a0to set the price on \u00a3300 trillion of financial products. &quot;I can assure you we are looking at individuals,&quot; she said as the FSA and US regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the department of justice, published documents showing the widespread rigging of Libor at RBS. A series of electronic exchanges linked RBS traders to those at other banks, particularly Swiss bank UBS, who submitted rates to the Libor panel. There was also unethical contact involving inter-dealer\u00a0brokers who act as intermediaries, with promises of &quot;sushi rolls&quot; and &quot;making love&quot; in return for rigging Libor submissions. &quot;It&apos;s just amazing how Libor fixing can make you that much money \u2026 it&apos;s a cartel now in London,&quot; wrote one RBS trader specialising in yen Libor in an instant message sent in August 2007. Libor is the London interbank offered rate and is set across 15 time frames of up to one year and in 10 currencies. Twenty-one individuals at RBS were involved in manipulating the yen and Swiss franc Libor &quot;either falsely high \u2026 or falsely low&quot;, according to the CFTC, which in turn helped the profitability of swaps positions held by the bailed-out bank. The documents published by the regulators said &quot;corrupt payments&quot; of \u00a3212,000 were made to unnamed inter-dealer brokers and that RBS &quot;abetted UBS&apos;s attempts to manipulate&quot; Libor in yen. The Swiss bank has already been fined \u00a3940m and two of its traders have been charged by the US regulators in connection to the scandal. One of those charged, former UBS trader Tom Hayes, is named in documents filed by the US justice department as asking a RBS trader: &quot;mate did you manage to spk [speak] to your cash boys&quot;. The response from &quot;trader 3&quot; at RBS indicating that he had attempted to change the rate was met with the comment &quot;i owe you big time&quot;. The justice department stressed that the charges against Hayes, who is facing extradition from the UK to the US, were &quot;merely accusations and he is considered innocent unless and until proven guilty&quot;. The other former UBS trader charged by the US is Roger Darin. The department secured a guilty plea from the Asian subsidiary of RBS to rigging Libor \u2013 as it did with UBS \u2013 which assistant attorney general Lanny Breuer described as &quot;extraordinary results&quot;. He added: &quot;Our message is clear: no financial institution is above the law.&quot; Stephen Hester, chief executive of RBS, refused to identify the 21 individuals \u2013 out of a workforce of 137,000 \u2013 involved in the &quot;wrong doing&quot;. Six staff were dismissed, including two managers, while six have been &quot;severely disciplined&quot; or were still involved in a disciplinary process and remain at the bank. Another eight left before disciplinary action could be taken while one was dismissed for misconduct not related to these findings. One of those to be fired, Tan Chi Min, is bringing a case in Singapore of wrongful dismissal on the basis that the bank condoned the manipulation of Libor. He sent instant messages in April 2008 saying, &quot;Nice Libor \u2026 our six-month\u00a0fixing moved the entire fixing hahaha&quot;, according to transcripts filed in Singapore court. The extent of the Libor rigging forced Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of RBS, to defend the role of Hester. The Libor manipulation had carried on for two years after Hester was parachuted into the bank following the \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in October 2008. The systems and controls inside the bank were considered inadequate by the FSA until last year. &quot;While the evidence shows that senior management was not involved in or aware of any wrongdoing, we accept that systems and controls were not as strong as they should have been and were not fixed quickly enough,&quot; said Hampton. He made a contrast with Barclays, which when it was the first bank fined for rigging Libor had found that its top management had been aware of attempts to deliberately reduce submissions to the Libor panel during the 2007 and 2008 financial crisis. Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond resigned, as did chairman Marcus Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier. &quot;It is important to make clear that, in contrast with some other banks, there is no evidence that any attempt was made by group management to suppress Libor submissions, in order to present a false picture of the group&apos;s funding costs. The findings against RBS concern the activities of traders,&quot; he said. But regulators pointed to failures at RBS which had allowed the manipulation to take place by placing derivatives traders and submitters together on the same desk, heightening the conflict of interest between the profit motives of the traders and the responsibility of submitters &quot;to make honest submissions&quot;. Even when they were separated \u2013 for business, not compliance reasons \u2013 the misconduct continued through Bloomberg chats and an internal instant messaging system. The fallout of the Libor rigging is expected to continue for months while the FSA and regulators around the world continue their investigations. More immediately, though, Hampton and Hester are now preparing to face further questions on Monday from the members of the banking standard commission, chaired by the Tory MP Andrew Tyrie. McDermott added that it would be some time before the FSA was able to give any indication if any of individuals under scrutiny \u2013 not all of them from RBS \u2013 would face penalties from the regulator."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/feb/07/wto-deal-revive-trade-talks", "sentences": ["Compare that with Singapore, where the export process requires four documents and takes only five days to complete."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-07T07:00:03Z", "title": "WTO eyes pared-down deal to revive trade talks | Paige McClanahan", "tags": ["Trade and development", "Global development", "WTO", "World news", "Doha trade talks", "International trade", "Business"], "article": "With the WTO&apos;s beleaguered Doha round of talks at an impasse, trade officials in Geneva have set their sights on a more modest deal for 2013. If they succeed, the agreement, which would be announced at a high-level meeting in Bali at the end of this year, could provide a big boost to developing country economies. &quot;Everybody has agreed that there can be an early harvest,&quot; says Patricia Francis, the head of the International Trade Centre, using trade officials&apos; preferred term for a pared-down agreement under the 11-year-old Doha talks. &quot;I think what is potentially doable is a trade facilitation agreement,&quot; she adds. Trade facilitation is WTO-speak for cutting the red tape that slows the movement of goods and services across international borders. &quot;Facilitating&quot; trade involves easing documentation requirements, streamlining customs procedures and training border officials. At its worst, red tape can be a formidable barrier to international commerce. According to the World Bank&apos;s Ease of Doing Business index, exporting a product from Malawi requires 10 separate documents and takes an average of 34 days. Compare that with Singapore, where the export process requires four documents and takes only five days to complete. A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that reducing the transaction costs of global trade by just 1% would increase worldwide income by more than $40bn, nearly two-thirds of which would go to developing countries.\u00a0 &quot;The thickness of borders today costs two to five times more than import tariffs,&quot; WTO director general Pascal Lamy said in a speech in Delhi last week. He added that an agreement on trade facilitation would be &quot;a logical first step&quot; in reviving progress in the multilateral trade talks, which have seen little progress in the past few years. More positive signals came from Davos, where trade officials meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum last month discussed what might emerge from the multilateral trade talks in 2013. An agreement on trade facilitation was high on the list. But negotiators are still a long way from finalising the wording of a potential trade facilitation deal. The draft text, as it stands, contains more than 200 brackets, or items on which negotiators disagree. There is no guarantee that they will manage to work out their differences in time for the ministerial meeting in Bali, which is scheduled for the first week of December. At least some of the controversy arises because developing countries are wary of signing up to a new set of legally binding rules that they might struggle to implement, says Lucas Saronga, a Tanzanian trade official based in Geneva. Poorer nations also worry that slashing red tape could lead to an influx of cheap imports, undercutting their domestic producers. &quot;No one is questioning the benefits of trade facilitation if it is taken properly,&quot; says Saronga. &quot;But we believe that it&apos;s only when we can be assured of flexibilities \u2026 that we can be comfortable to take on binding commitments.&quot; If developing countries sign up to anything on trade facilitation, they want to be sure that they get something in return, Saronga added. Among other things, they are pushing for concessions on issues like agriculture and a potential &quot;monitoring mechanism&quot; to track the implementation of special provisions for poor countries in WTO agreements. But it&apos;s not clear what, if anything, the developing countries will be able to secure in the talks on these fronts. The trade facilitation talks may be complicated because the WTO is deeply engrossed in picking a new leader, a process that will last until the end of May. Whoever replaces Lamy as director general on 1 September will have only three months to get up to speed before the meeting in Bali. &quot;It&apos;s probably 50-50,&quot; says Aileen Kwa of the South Centre, on the likelihood of an &quot;early harvest&quot; deal at the Bali meeting. &quot;Yes, there is a lot of momentum in the sense that some people are pushing it a lot, but at the same time there are so many differences in the negotiations, and those differences are very deeply entrenched.&quot; But WTO officials are growing increasingly eager to actually get something done, as many observers are beginning to question the organisation&apos;s relevance. Securing a deal &quot;would give the WTO a boost of energy, which it really requires now&quot;, says Francis of the ITC, adding: &quot;If we can&apos;t do something at Bali in December in terms of delivering something on the Doha agenda, then I think we&apos;re in big trouble.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/feb/07/scrapping-gcse-bridge-too-far", "sentences": ["On the new curriculum, Gove said it was modelled on the heavily fact-based systems in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as the US state of Massachusetts, which is heavily influenced by ED Hirsch, a Gove hero who argues students cannot begin to properly reason or assess until they are provided with key building blocks of raw knowledge."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-07T13:44:16Z", "title": "Scrapping GCSEs was 'a bridge too far', admits Gove", "tags": ["GCSEs", "Schools", "Exams", "Education", "Michael Gove", "Politics", "UK news", "Education policy"], "article": "     Michael Gove has confirmed he is to abandon plans to replace GCSEs with a new English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBC), calling the proposal, one of his flagship schools policies, &quot;a bridge too far&quot; which was unlikely to work. While Labour described the about-turn as a humiliation for the education secretary, Gove instead unveiled to the Commons a shake-up of GCSEs that he insisted would take in many elements of the EBC, including assessment by rigorous exams rather than coursework and modules. The new system will be in place for English, maths, science, history and geography for teaching in 2015, with exams two years later, the same timetable as planned for the EBC. At the same time, Gove announced a new system to assess and rank schools, doing away with the standard league table measure of the percentage of pupils who got a C or better in five GCSEs including English and maths, which he said distorted teaching by placing too much focus on students at the crucial C/D borderline. He also gave details of a new national curriculum, slimmed down but with a distinctly traditional approach. Pupils will be expected to focus more on spelling, grammar and arithmetic, to be able to identify cities and rivers on maps and study &quot;the great works of the literary canon&quot;. In his statement to MPs, which never once referred directly to the EBC, introduced only in September last year, Gove said the main sticking point had been the decision to allow only one board to set EBC papers for each subject, something officials said could bring legal challenges from boards who missed out. However, briefings before the statement suggested the policy was also sunk by Liberal Democrat opposition and a wider set of reservations expressed last year by the exams watchdog, Ofqual. Gove told MPs he accepted the planned changes were too great: &quot;We have consulted on those proposals and there is a consensus that the system needs to change. But one of the proposals that I put forwards was a bridge too far.&quot; He added: &quot;There were significant risks in trying to both strengthen qualification and to end competition in large parts of the exams market. Instead, we will concentrate on reforming existing GCSEs broadly along the lines that we put forward in September.&quot; The new GCSEs will be assessed by exams, with extended writing tests in subjects like English and history and &quot;fewer bite-sized and overly structured questions&quot;, Gove said. The current choice of higher and foundation tier GCSEs \u2013 the latter are easier but have a maximum grade of C \u2013 will be ended, with every pupil taking the same exams. On assessment for schools, Gove said the &quot;deceptively simple&quot; measure of five good GCSEs tempted teachers and students into picking subjects seen as easy to pass, and excessive attention on the C/D border at the expense of both stronger and less able pupils, complaints long expressed by many teachers. In its place will comes two gauges. The first is a simple one based on English and maths passes, the other a more complex, &quot;value added&quot; measure taking in pupils&apos; progress up to their GCSE in eight subjects from three areas \u2013 English and maths, three subjects from the sciences, history and geography, languages and computer science; and three &quot;additional subjects&quot;, taking in arts and &quot;high quality vocational subjects&quot;. This last policy appears intended to address the complaints that the EBC would focus too much attention on a narrow band of subjects, at the expense of areas such as art. On the new curriculum, Gove said it was modelled on the heavily fact-based systems in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as the US state of Massachusetts, which is heavily influenced by ED Hirsch, a Gove hero who argues students cannot begin to properly reason or assess until they are provided with key building blocks of raw knowledge. The Commons response from Labour&apos;s education spokesman, Stephen Twigg, sought to emphasise the reputational damage on a minister who has was known for forcing big changes through the system, despite vehement opposition from teaching unions. &quot;The words &apos;GCSE&apos; and &apos;fiasco&apos; seem to be indelibly linked under this government,&quot; Twigg said. &quot;This is a humiliating climbdown.&quot; The CBI, which had previously expressed scepticism at the EBC, described the change as &quot;sensible&quot;. Neil Carberry, its head of employment and skills policy, said: &quot;It&apos;s pleasing to see a shift in thinking on exam league tables, which will need to encourage schools to focus on the performance of every child.&quot; Teaching unions also welcomed the scrapping of the EBC. However, Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said there remained some worries about the proposed changes to GCSEs. He added: &quot;We also support changes to the current system of league table measurements which pin schools down to arbitrary targets and limit imaginative teaching. Measuring attainment across a combination of eight subjects, rather than five, will have a real effect on the way schools look at their pupils. Therefore, this could be a good thing but schools will need time to adapt.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/feb/07/live-chat-ken-hom-chinese-new-year-cookery", "sentences": ["Beelzebozo asks: Last time Ken did a live chat on this website I asked for a Singapore noodles recipe which has resulted in me not ordering a takeaway since, so thanks Ken!So, Ken, how about a good recipe for Pork belly?", "Ken Hom responds:  @Beelzebozo Morning, I am so pleased that Singapore noodles recipe has served you so well."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-07T15:30:00Z", "title": "Live chat: Ken Hom on Chinese cookery", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Ken Hom", "Life and style", "Chinese new year"], "article": "This Sunday sees the start of the Chinese Year of the Snake \u2013 and to celebrate, the man who transformed the British view of Chinese cookery with hugely popular books and TV series was live online to answer your questions, and inspire you to cook up your own feast to celebrate. The food eaten during Chinese New Year celebrations is steeped in tradition and symbolism. Long noodles signify long life, chicken represents good fortune and served whole indicates family unity, and duck symbolises fidelity. Some dishes are eaten at new year because of the sound of the word in Chinese \u2013 fish, for example, (y\u00fa) sounds like the words for &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;abundance&quot;, so eating fish dishes at the new year meal is a wish for plenty. Similarly, nian gao (traditional rice cakes) are especially popular at the spring festival as the name sounds like the words for &quot;higher year&quot;.  To inspire you in creating your menu, we&apos;ve published some delicious recipes from Ken&apos;s new book, Exploring China, from his recent BBC series with Ching-He Huang. There&apos;s a quick 10-minute salmon recipe with spring onions to showcase the freshest of fish, and a hot and sour dish from the Sichuan region.

How Ken Hom answered your questions CeilingCat asks: Do you have any suggestions for a good make of Doubanjiang (chili bean paste) that you can get in the UK? Ken Hom responds: @CeilingCat: Morning, thanks for your question. Lee Kum Kee makes some great chilli bean paste, available in most UK supermarkets. Happy New Year. MonkeyBoodle asks: I&apos;ve bought a duck crown with wings but I don&apos;t want to deep-fry it! Can you suggest any noodle dishes? Ideally I would love to cook it on the bone because of the flavour. Thanks :-) Ken Hom responds: @MonkeyBoodle - I suggest roasting the duck with salted five spice powder, and then when it is cooked - shred the meat and mix with noodles. Delicious! Beelzebozo asks: Last time Ken did a live chat on this website I asked for a Singapore noodles recipe which has resulted in me not ordering a takeaway since, so thanks Ken!So, Ken, how about a good recipe for Pork belly? Ken Hom responds:  @Beelzebozo Morning, I am so pleased that Singapore noodles recipe has served you so well. The best recipe for Pork Belly is in my complete Chinese Cook Book, if you follow it exactly you will have the most delicious, crispiest pork belly ever. Trust me! Herrcule asks Hi Ken, do you like coffee? Ken Hom responds: @Herrcule -Morning, I do like de-caf coffee, as well as green tea. Buzzandhum asks If you make dumpling wrappers fresh, do they stick together? I can&apos;t make fresh dumplings, even by following any proportions, without the dough seeming too soft. Ken Hom responds: @Buzzandhum - I find that one of the best dumpling wrappers is a pasta recipe. Follow my friends&apos; Antonio Carluccio recipe for pasta. Good luck! TheJoyOfEssex asks Hi Ken. If you had to order a takeaway which cuisine would you go for and why? Ken Hom responds: @TheJoyOfEssex - Morning, I&apos;d probably choose Chinese food, sushi or a great pizza, the main reason for choosing sushi or pizza is that I never make these myself. snelly asks I&apos;m vegetarian now but used to love won ton soup. Could you suggest something else with which I could stuff the won tons? I&apos;ve tried water chestnut for texture, but it&apos;s a bit bland, taste-wise. Ken Hom responds: Morning @snelly, chopped Bok Choy together with preserved mustard greens, bound with an egg makes a great vegetarian stuffing. Good luck and Happy New Year. Demeralda asks Is there a reasonable way to make fresh rice noodles at home? I&apos;ve watched videos but it is intimidating. Ken Hom responds: @Demeralda - I&apos;m impressed you are happy to give it a go, but very few people in China make them as its so impractical. I&apos;d suggest you buy them and spend your time preparing the rest of the Chinese New Year banquet. Good luck and Happy New Year! peoplelovepeople asks Hi Ken, an old book of yours got me into Chinese and mainland SE Asian cookery as a kid, now as a man still my favorite dishes are from the wider region. Can you suggest an honest recipe for the BBQ/Red pork that we see hanging in shop windows the world over? Ken Hom responds: @peoplelovepeople -Morning, you have very good taste. There is a similar recipe in my complete Chinese Cook Book, it is really authentic as it doesn&apos;t use red food colouring and tastes delicious SybilSanderson asks Good morning Ken. Could you please provide a recipe for a claypot (dried) mushroom dish suitable for vegetarians. Or give a suggestion for spices or seasoning to make generally vegetarian dishes taste &quot;richer&quot;. Thank you Ken Hom responds: @SybilSanderson - Good morning. If you braise dried Chinese mushrooms in a clay pot with a very savoury sauce (try vegetarian stock with five spiced powder, chilli bean sauce, hoisin sauce and a couple of star anise, and of course soy sauce) you will end up with a very rich, almost meaty dish. I hope that helps, best of luck with it. Happy New Year. tarifeno asks How do I make yam croquette dim sum please Ken Hom responds: @tarifeno - You can find a very good recipe in Complete Chinese Cook book for steamed beef meatballs. As a tasty alternative you can substitute pork for beef. dcwoodruff asks: Hi Ken, my parents are currently travelling throughout the whole of china, have you any restaurant recommendations for the best sichuanese in Chengdu or for Hong Kong dim sum. Thank you Ken Hom responds: What a question...there are so many. In Sichuan there is a restaurant with yubo which is the best. In Hong Kong, the best dim sum is in the Intercontinental Hotel in Kowloon. I hope your parents enjoy their travels. Maggie57 asks I would be interested in knowing if whole crabs (brown crabs as we have them) are much used in Chinese cooking, and if so, which would be your favourite recipe? Ken Hom responds: @Maggie57 - crab makes a delicious dish, my favourite recipe is in Complete Chinese Cook Book where the crab is cooked simply with ginger and spring onions. I&apos;d love to hear how you get on - could you tweet me on @chefkenhom normansmee asks Hi Ken - I bought some dried bean curd sheets (which i think might also be known as &apos;yuba&apos;?) and I&apos;m looking for a couple of things to do with them. I understand stuffed yuba rolls are the more common way to go, but i&apos;ve also read that you can braise the sticks too? Can i use the sheets instead of sticks for braising, and do you have any recipes for either the sheets or sticks? (Ideally, looking for vegetarian recipes, though not essential, just after something tasty!) Ken Hom responds: @normansmee -You are correct, you can braise both. I recommend braising with fermented bean curd for a wonderful, tasty dish. One to add to your Chinese banquet.Have a Happy New Year MisterA asks The secret of a good egg fu yung would be appreciated, mine always ends up like omelette, how do the restaurants get that perfect set on the egg? Ken Hom responds: @MisterA - Good morning, this isn&apos;t really a Chinese dish, usually Chinese restaurants would serve a simple stir fried egg dish which is probably what you&apos;ve had. Have a great Chinese New Year. normansmee asks Hi Ken - any ideas for making the most of the seasonal, British winter veg? I&apos;m thinking things like Kale, Jersualem artichoke (which is kind of like a water chestnut in some ways), and celeriac, all of which are really good at the moment, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Thanks. Ken Hom responds: @normansmee - I love winter vegetables. I think root vegetables are best simply braised with a little bit of stock and hoisin sauce.  richieroma asks: Hi Ken. Just back from Tokyo and had the most succulent tongue in a restaurant there. I asked the waiter how they cooked it so beautifully and he said they boiled it. Surely not? It was like butter. Any cooking tips for this underrated part of the cow much appreciated! Ken Hom responds: @richieroma - Thanks for your question. Tongue is wonderful braised in a savoury Chinese sauce of stock, soy sauce, star anice and cinnamon. Long, slow cooking makes it very tender. Happy New Year to you. owBLD asks Ken, I don&apos;t have a question but I just wanted to tell you that you rock. Ken Hom responds: @owBLD - Thanks so much, you&apos;re very cool too. Have a wonderful Chinese New Year. streakyradio asks Chinese restaurants make stir fried beef melt in the mouth tender, when I try it is like rubber. What is the secret? Ken Hom responds: @streakyradio - A lot of Chinese restaurants marinade their stir fried beef. What I tend to do is to use a tender cut of meat (fillet) for the perfect beef stir fry. SophieAlexandra asks Hi Ken, I&apos;m thinking of having a Chinese New Year party on Saturday night, but I don&apos;t know where to start! What&apos;s the most important aspect of the celebration? Thanks. Ken Hom responds: @SophieAlexandra Morning, everything you need for your Chinese New Year banquet can be found on my website www.kenhom.co.uk. It is packed with top tips and recipes - everything you need for the perfect celebration. katybird asks I&apos;m planning to make a celebratory meal for two for Chinese new year, but don&apos;t have a lot of money - we will make steamed pork dumplings with pork mince and home-made dough, but do you have any recommendations for a cheap but celebratory &apos;main&apos; dish to accompany these, some rice and some dry-fired green beans? Thanks! Ken Hom responds: @katybird - It&apos;s great that you are celebrating on Saturday night. There is an authentic recipe for dry-fired green beans in my complete Chinese Cook Book. Also you may be pleased to know that my full meal range at Tesco is currently on offer - \u00a35 for two mains and two sides. Hopefully you will find something for your banquet there. MarmadukeScarlet asks Is there a western substitute for black rice vinegar? And what mushrooms should I use rather than wood ear mushrooms? (I am not sure what flavour and/texture I am looking for). Ken Hom responds: @MarmadukeScarlet - You can substitute black rice vinegar with balsamic vinegar; and dried Chinese black mushrooms are quite readily available in the UK and make a good substitute for wood ear mushrooms. I hope this helps, enjoy your Chinese New Year celebrations and have a look at www.kenhom.co.uk for some Chinese recipes and top tips. baduism asks Morning Ken, Do you have any tips on making the casing for steamed dim sum dumplings? Ken Hom responds: @baduism - I&apos;d suggest just buying wonton skins to make life a little easier. Voodoo22 asks Hi Ken, What&apos;s your favourite thing to do with pork belly or pork shoulder? I&apos;m hoping you can suggest something spicy and sticky if possible! Many thanks and Happy New Year to you and yours. Ken Hom responds: @Voodoo22 - Thank you for your question, I love pork too. There is a wonderful red pork recipe in Complete Chinese Cook book - which, I think, is exactly what you are looking for. Happy New Year to you too. livingstonia asks The other day I used a ready made black bean sauce to make a rather disappointing beef with peppers and black bean sauce. Turned out the sauce only had 5% beans in it! Have you got a recipe to make this sauce from scratch? Ken Hom responds: @livingstonia - The ideal is to rinse them before use to reduce the salt - and don&apos;t use too many. Ideally they should be coarsely chopped and mixed with garlic and ginger. I hope that helps. Best wishes, Ken Paul A Smith asks Ken is there a healthier way to enjoy fried rice? Ken Hom responds: @Paul A Smith - Morning Paul, yes there is a way to enjoy fried rice. I recommend cutting down the amount of oil that you are use and make sure you stir fry in a good non stick wok. Elizabeth Neal asks Hi Ken, I really enjoyed your recent series, so inspiring!My (half-chinese) boyfriend will be seeing the New Year in by serving a steamboat to some foodie friends. Any tips for making it extra special? Thanks  Ken Hom responds: @Elizabeth Neal - Be sure to use a really dense flavourful broth. Have a great New Year celebration and if you want some tips on traditions please visit my website miranda07 asks I would love to make my own version of char siu marinade for pork rather than buying char siu &apos;paste&apos; - could you please suggest what ingredients would be best to use? @miranda07 - Morning,I have a complete recipe for this in my Complete Chinese Cook book which doesn&apos;t us any artificial ingredients. I think you will enjoy this and it is easy to follow. LaCoccinelle asks I live in sw France an hour south of Chaors and of course, it&apos;s duck country. I like the duck breast in the UK served quite simply with rice in a sauce. Do you have a recipe for that, or a favourite recipe for duck which you made when you lived here. I make your tomato, lemon grass &amp; coconut milk soup and even won a prize (large white soup tureen) with it at a local soup making competition, so thanks for that. Also regularly make a variation on a recipe of yours from Hot Wok, called Thai Chicken, I add mange tout and small new potatoes, and sometimes make it with butternut squash, chick peas and mange tout. Ken Hom responds: @LaCoccinelle - Duck is wonderful sliced and marinated in soy sauce, rice wine, sesame oil and corn flour. Stir fry that with onion and oyster sauce for a simple and delicious meal. Congratulations on winning the competition - glad I could help. Enjoy your Chinese New Year. MisterA asks Ken, UK Cuisine has lots of trends and crazes, what are the latest trends in Chinese cuisine and how do you see it evolving? Ken Hom responds: @MisterA - There is more emphasis on regional dishes and even some Chinese molecular cooking, I&apos;m not so keen on this myself though. Hermann asks Question for Ken: I am trying to eat well now - the food has to be tasty but healthy too. I like the look of your salmon and spring onion recipe - it will get a whirl tonight. But is there any such thing as a low-fat duck recipe? Ken Hom responds: @Hermann - If you take off the skin duck can be quite lean so give it a whirl. KenHom says Thank you so much everyone for your questions. It&apos;s been a great morning. I hope you all have a wonderful Year of the Snake. Happy New Year.

But if his draft national curriculum is any guide we might as a nation get much, much, better at University Challenge. Announced alongside the decision to keep GCSEs after all and to broaden the way secondary schools are judged, comes a 173-page document, plus appendixes on grammar and punctuation, which lays down the Gove-ian vision of what children in England should be taught. While this is a deliberately slimmed down document \u2013 Gove argues it should form &quot;only part of the whole curriculum, not its entirety&quot;, allowing teachers to go off piste occasionally \u2013 what it lack in pages it makes up for in suggested facts. Lots of them. As well as a thorough grounding in the essentials of maths, spelling, grammar and punctuation, from 2014 children will be expected to pinpoint cities and rivers on a globe in geography classes, while history will present, in Gove&apos;s words to parliament, &quot;a clear narrative of British progress with a proper emphasis on heroes and heroines from our past&quot;. English will involve &quot;the great works of the literary canon&quot;. Gove said: &quot;We are determined to give every child, regardless of background a broad, balanced, education so that by the time their compulsory education is complete they are well-equipped for further study, future employment and adult life.&quot; This back-to-basics approach is at the centre of the education secretary&apos;s philosophy, one heavily influenced by systems in places such as Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as the US state of Massachusetts, all mentioned in Gove&apos;s address to MPs. Gove has stated many times his admiration for the American educational thinker Eric Hirsch, whose works heavily influenced a curriculum revamp in Massachusetts, and Daniel Willingham, an American cognitive psychologist. Both these men argue that before students can begin analysis or criticism in a given subject they must first have a good enough store of the facts, ones committed deeply to memory rather than culled on demand from reference books or the internet. The education secretary argues that such an approach is vital for social progression, saying disadvantaged pupils who might not absorb such knowledge at home must be provided with it by teachers. In a speech on Tuesday night outlining his ideas Gove said that without a curriculum like this &quot;students from poorer homes will continue to perform less well in the exercise of every basic skill that one needs to be employed in the modern world&quot;. He added: &quot;The accumulation of cultural capital \u2013 the acquisition of knowledge \u2013 is the key to social mobility.&quot; It is an approach very much favoured by educational conservatives at present. The Department for Education was soon circulating an approving quote from the historian and author Simon Sebag Montefiore, who praised a &quot;proper emphasis on the heroes and heroines who bring history to life&quot;. Teaching unions were more circumspect, though the NASUWT bemoaned the freedom granted to maintained schools to deviate further from a set curriculum, as academies, free schools and private schools can do so already. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland follow their own versions. Beyond the fact-heavy tone there were few obvious significant changes. The same core subjects remain \u2013 English, maths, science, art, citizenship, computing (a name change from ICT), design and technology, geography, history, languages, music and PE \u2013 though with a foreign language made part of the compulsory study in late primary school for the first time. Labour officials pointed out that for all the talk of the literary greats only one, Shakespeare, was actually named, and there was lack of a specific mention of the NHS in post-war British history. Regarding history, on the fringes of the debate campaigners hailed the return of Mary Seacole, the pioneering black British figure who tended soldiers in the Crimean war, and who was due to be removed from the curriculum. Seacole&apos;s place in the curriculum had been &quot;not just cemented, but enhanced&quot;, Gove told MPs. Financial groups meanwhile praised the addition of classes on personal budgeting and money management in the citizenship syllabus. The Amateur Swimming Association gave a sigh of relief that its sport had made the cut for PE. For all the debate, the paradox is that laying down what should be taught will most likely have less actual impact on schools than another change \u2013 that of how the success of schools is gauged. There has been a growing chorus of complaint from teachers, governors and others that the basic ranking measure for secondary schools \u2013 what percentage of a school&apos;s 16-year-olds get five GCSEs at C or above, including maths and English \u2013 is too narrow and distorts teaching, encouraging tricks such as schools entering students for two English GCSEs and picking the better grade. Gove agreed, telling the Commons the measure had led to excessive focus on the crucial C/D borderline, taking attention from students either struggling or thriving. The ranking measure is to be abolished, said Gove. Instead there would be a simple percentage for pupils reaching the decreed level in English and maths, and a more complex points score based on eight GCSEs. To the delight of critics of the narrow scope of the EBC this could include up to three &quot;other&quot; GCSEs, taking in the likes of art and some vocational subjects. This was largely welcomed by teaching unions and Maggie Atkinson, the Children&apos;s Commissioner for England, who said it would encourage a broader approach to learning."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/urban-living-impact-health-wellbeing", "sentences": ["A recent study by the London School of Economics finds that people are likely to live longer in cities like Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong, where public transport and walking are favoured over private car use."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-08T15:00:00Z", "title": "How we can improve the impact of urban living on health and wellbeing", "tags": ["Health and wellbeing", "Guardian sustainable business", "Behaviour", "Smart cities"], "article": "It&apos;s official: New Yorkers are living longer. The average Big Apple resident can now expect to make it to the ripe old age of 80.6 years \u2013 eight years more than in 1990. No other US city has seen such a leap. Why the spike? The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which conducted the research, is reluctant to draw explicit conclusions. For one, the population of New York isn&apos;t the same today as in 1990 given the millions of migrants that come and go every year. And back in 1990, high levels of HIV/AIDS and murders were skewing the city&apos;s mortality figures. That said, most deaths (87%) are caused by non-communicable diseases \u2013 cancer, heart disease, strokes, diabetes and the like \u2013 and it&apos;s reductions in these that most clearly explain New Yorkers living longer lives. Deaths from heart disease, for instance, are down a whopping 25% from a decade ago. Mounting evidence For Johanna Ralston, chief executive of the World Heart Federation (WHF), the example of New York provides a stellar case of &quot;retrofitting&quot; a city to make it more heart-healthy. She points to numerous public health interventions introduced under Mayor Michael Bloomberg: a ban on smoking in public places, new bicycle routes, calorie labels on restaurant menus, advertising campaigns around the benefits of taking exercise, to name just a few. &quot;This all helps build the body of evidence about what an important platform cities can be&quot;, she states. Ralston is right to be enthused. This time last year, WHF released a report highlighting the link between urbanisation and cardiovascular disease. The report spelt out a five-step approach based on mitigating risks, such as exposure to tobacco and poor diets, and increasing preventative measures, such as taking exercise and educating children about healthy living. Since the report&apos;s publication, more evidence has come to light. A recent study by the London School of Economics finds that people are likely to live longer in cities like Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong, where public transport and walking are favoured over private car use. Furthermore, differences of life expectancy can be found within cities too. West Londoners, for example, are likely to live seven years longer than their East London counterparts. The findings suggest urban form is a &quot;contributing factor&quot; to human health, says Ricky Burdett, director of the LSE Cities programme: &quot;One can begin at least to speculate that these correlations are not just to do with where people of different education or income come from, but that their physical conditions will affect their wellbeing and health.&quot; City planning Policy makers are increasingly beginning to take note. Susan Thompson, who heads the Healthy Built Environment Programme at the University of New South Wales, points to a &quot;groundswell of interest&quot; among planners and health officials in recent years. She points to explicit health and wellbeing provision in the city plans of metropolitan centres such as Portland, USA, and Vancouver, Canada, as well as London. One of the big advances over the past 12 months is the uptake of cardiovascular health in key policy circles. The World Health Organisation, for instance, is dedicating this year&apos;s World Health Day to the issue of hypertension, a major cause of heart-related illness. The Clinton Global Initiative is also pushing for many of the World Heart Federation&apos;s recommendations to be adopted. The reconstruction of New York after Hurricane Sandy marks a prime opportunity. In a similar vein, advocates of cardiovascular health succeeded in including specific language around chronic non-communicable diseases in the Rio +20 summit last summer. The WHF is currently preparing a document for the UN secretary general that calls for cardiovascular health to be factored into the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. &quot;The place where sustainable development and health merge most elegantly is the development of cities and addressing urbanisation&quot;, Ralston says. The big challenge centres on applying this thinking in the mega-cities of the developing world, where unregulated urban growth is driving up heart problems at unprecedented rates. As Ralston notes: &quot;You can sit back and say, &apos;Gee, aren&apos;t organic gardens great. But, guess what? They don&apos;t have them in Shenzhen. They just have 18 million people who weren&apos;t there 30 years ago.&quot; Mumbai, Mexico City, Lagos or any number of other examples would fit just as well. Employers&apos; responsibility What can the private sector be doing? House builders, infrastructure providers and architects are clearly best placed to take direct action in how our cities are designed. More joined-up thinking is required, says Martin Hunt, head of networks and partnerships for Forum for the Future. Take London, he says. The UK capital is currently suffering a housing shortage. &quot;We want to build homes, but we want to build them in the right way. That requires green space, the ability to exercise and move around freely and safely, and being in an environment that&apos;s well-lit, car-free and with good access to public transport&quot;, he states. Heart-healthy cities depend not just on urban design, of course. You can have green corridors linking parks, or calorie-marked menus, but individual residents still need to don their running shoes or opt for the low-fat option. Companies, especially those with large workforces, can play an active role here, says Jenny Hawker, a health management expert at UK consultancy Mercer. Sports clubs, wellness programmes, flexible working options and bike-to-work schemes are just some of the initiatives responsible employers might consider. As public health budgets tighten, the private sector can expect more pressure from government to promote cardiovascular health, Hawker adds: &quot;You can&apos;t exclude the employer in all this. They do have responsibility because they are part of the city environment.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

That will be just the first phase of transforming the three square mile site into a gambling and conference city crowned by a 72-storey hotel building that will become the biggest in the region \u2013 looming over the neighbouring campus headquarters of Santander bank. By that stage the so-called EuroVegas complex will have tripled in size to house 12 resorts with half a dozen casinos, a convention centre, three golf courses, theatres, shopping malls, bars and restaurants. &quot;I think it will be very exciting for everyone,&quot; said Leven, who added that Adelson, 79, hoped to see it completed before his 100th birthday. Sources close to the company claimed that, when the entire project is finished in 18 years, some 240,000 direct and indirect jobs would be created. &quot;We are building four resorts in the first phase, with approximately 3,000 bedrooms in each resort and the attendant facilities,&quot; said Leven, who compared the job-creating capacity to the company&apos;s projects in Singapore and Macau. &quot;Singapore, which is about the same size as one of these [12 eventual resorts], employs approximately 10,000 people directly and 10,000 more indirectly.&quot; ABC newspaper ran pictures from the EuroVegas project it claimed had been presented to local government officials by the company, showing two Shard-like twin skyscrapers said to be 250 metres tall that appear to represent one of the &quot;resorts&quot;. The complex will reportedly also include a copy of New York&apos;s Times Square. The announcement comes after years of negotiations and saw the Madrid regional government announce what appeared to be a made-to-measure public tender. The tender process was set to be completed by September, officials said. Madrid&apos;s regional president Ignacio Gonzalez also virtually promised that Spain&apos;s central government would deliver the tax changes, infrastructure and even exemptions to the no-smoking laws that Adelson sought. &quot;On the tax side everything is resolved, though some changes from central government are awaited,&quot; he said. &quot;The smoking issue is also a matter for central government. It is working on it and will come up with a solution in the next few months, with a chance for restricted smoking.&quot; Government officials later denied that they planned to change no-smoking laws but protesters claimed that the government was creating a special low-tax &quot;mini-state&quot; for Adelson. &quot;Citizens have never been consulted about this,&quot; the EuroVegas No platform said in a statement. &quot;The most probable thing is that EuroVegas provides profits for a very few while causing irreversible environmental damage.&quot; &quot;This project is not just about gambling, but is an integral resort,&quot; said Gonzalez, highlighting the conference centre, shopping malls, theatres and other leisure facilities at the site. While Adelson&apos;s Las Vegas resorts now take in more money from non-gambling activities, the ones in Singapore and Macau are very dependent on their casinos. Gonzalez said that Madrid, which recently built a new terminal at the airport, had enough air capacity to handle the one million tourists from around Europe who would be expected to visit. Adelson hopes EuroVegas will become a magnet for conferences and gamblers from around the continent \u2014 just as his casinos and resorts in Macau cater for a vast Chinese market. Las Vegas-based Adelson is the 12th richest person in the United States, according to Forbes \u2014 which gives his net worth as $20.5bn. He received a $2.9bncash bonus from his company earlier this year. Adelson was a key Republican backer in the last presidential elections and is reported to be financing a campaign to prevent President Barack Obama nominating Chuck Hagel as defence secretary."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/feb/10/city-london-recycling-bins-screens", "sentences": ["Singapore and Tokyo are also in Memari&apos;s sights."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-10T18:11:21Z", "title": "Two-way news: City of London's new recycling bins with display screens", "tags": ["London", "Recycling", "Waste", "Ethical and green living", "Environment", "Advertising", "Media", "Digital media", "UK news", "Renewable energy", "Business"], "article": "People receive their news from many sources these days \u2013 papers, television, web, mobiles. And now, rubbish bins. Renew, a company co-founded in 2002 by chief executive Kaveh Memari, has developed a newspaper recycling bin which doubles as an open-air information screen. It has placed nearly 100 of the hi-tech bins around the City of London under a 21-year contract with the authority. The bins \u2013 or techno-pods as Memari refers to them \u2013 are made of damage-resistent fibreglass with screens at either end which can relay anything from news to advertisements to information on London underground delays or the number of Boris bikes available in the vicinity. A team of journalists provide the news feed, with other content coming from magazines such as the Economist and Time Out. A group of software developers \u2013 what Memari calls the Geek Squad \u2013 operate from Athens. The initial impetus for the bins came from the City of London authorities, with the capital littered with discarded free newspapers and Brussels putting pressure on for it missing recycling targets. Memari said: &quot;We de-risked it for the City, they don&apos;t pay for the service and the only risk for them is reputational [if things go wrong].&quot; The company had hoped to have 100 pods \u2013 200 screens \u2013 in place by the time of the Olympics, but that target slipped and was finally reached in November. But with the City getting the service for free, how does Renew propose to make money? Memari talks of several revenue streams: advertising, finding a major company to sponsor the pods, attracting publishers, talking to film studios, and even telecoms companies about using its wired connections to carry data services or conversations. &quot;We have killed the idea it&apos;s a grotty place for [advertisers and publishers] to put their messages. We are also talking to seven major film studios and they are very interested in the possibilities.&quot; He believes studios could film special scenes to be shown on the screens, linked to major movies in what is effectively a viral marketing campaign. The pods can also be used for emergency messages, with one recent test showing an alert reaching the system just three minutes after being received at the control room. Now the pods are in place Renew has begun its real push to advertisers and media, with marketing campaigns under way for a number of businesses including CNBC, Qatari Islamic Bank, and Wallpaper, as well as a couple of charities which have been given free or heavily discounted airtime. Renew has raised \u00a34m in total from investors so far, mainly high net-worth individuals including one Premier League and England footballer. It has run up \u00a33m of debt, but received financing to help with the rollout of the pods from the Qatari Investment Authority. &quot;We went to all the high street banks, but nothing,&quot; said Memari. &quot;Perhaps they thought the risk was too great. The Qataris looked at it as a real estate investment, much the same way they looked at the Shard and Harrods.&quot; It will need further funds as it expands overseas. It has one pod situated near Wall Street in New York, is looking at a trial of 100 units in the City, and may need to raise another \u00a35m if this succeeds. Singapore and Tokyo are also in Memari&apos;s sights."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/feb/10/football-match-fixing-no-surprise", "sentences": ["The same year Tampere United were indefinitely suspended from the Finnish league after being unable to explain why they took \u20ac300,000 from a company in Singapore.", "It remains the case that Dan Tan Seet Eng, who has been accused of match-fixing in several countries, is still free in Singapore despite an Italian arrest warrant."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-10T22:00:01Z", "title": "Football match-fixing is no surprise \u2013 what we need now are solutions | Sean Ingle", "tags": ["Match-fixing", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of Europol&apos;s match-fixing revelations was how many people were astonished. It was as if Robert Hoyzer, Raj Perumal and the other grubby footballing perverters and inverters had not existed, and words such as Scommessopoli had never become shorthand for scandal. The evidence has been there for more than a decade, from Brazil, Greece, Finland, Turkey, Italy, Germany and elsewhere. But we were like patients under anesthesia; drowsily comfortable in our own teams and dreams. In 2011 a court in Bochum convicted a gang of manipulating more than 300 matches in 12 European countries and Canada. The same year Tampere United were indefinitely suspended from the Finnish league after being unable to explain why they took \u20ac300,000 from a company in Singapore. Meanwhile Wikileaks revealed that the US embassy in Sofia warned: &quot;Today nearly all teams [in Bulgaria] are owned or connected to organised crime \u2026 allegations of illegal gambling and match-fixing plague the league.&quot; Reports from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Fifpro and the EU also shone flashlights, but few noticed. And then Europol crossed a few boxes, added a few international games, and called house \u2013 and the world went bonkers. But as Rick Parry, the former Liverpool chief executive who chaired the DCMS&apos;s highly regarded report on sports betting and corruption told me: &quot;There was little new in there. It seemed like grandstanding from Europol.&quot; Still, at least the issue is lodged in people&apos;s brains. But, to plunge into middle-management-speak, what we need now are solutions not problems. Let&apos;s start with the obvious: match-fixing is complex to investigate and difficult to prove. A player deliberately underperforming, or being in contact with a criminal, is not enough. There needs to be irrefutable evidence and ideally a paper trail \u2013 not easy when Asian bookmakers, where most bets are placed, are barely regulated. Globalisation has not helped either. As David Forrest, an economist at the University of Salford points out, it has given crooks plenty of targets to exploit. &quot;Lots of clubs are financially shaky and treat their players poorly,&quot; he says. &quot;When players are paid late it creates resentment and criminals take advantage.&quot; Last year Fifpro interviewed 3,357 professional players in eastern Europe and found 41% had not received their salaries on time, while 12% said they had been asked to manipulate a match \u2013 a figure that rose sharply for those paid late. The sharks smell desperation. Players and referees need face-to-face discussions about what is acceptable and to be warned about the dangers of being groomed, and later exploited. There also need to be discreet pathways for illegal approaches to be reported. Education needs be reinforced with legislation. Tougher rules to ensure clubs are financially sound and pay their players would help. As would a universal fit-and-proper person test, strong enough to deter gangsters from taking over near-bankrupt clubs and using them for money laundering or fixing matches, which has, incredibly, happened in Belgium and Finland. Doing that is hard enough but getting sporting authorities, police, governments and bookmakers to join in common purpose is even more important. And, sadly, very difficult. It remains the case that Dan Tan Seet Eng, who has been accused of match-fixing in several countries, is still free in Singapore despite an Italian arrest warrant. It makes you pine for the equivalent of a World Anti-Doping Agency for match-fixing, to bash heads and set standards. But Parry suggests it will never fly, as sporting authorities are suspicious of any encroachment on their territory. Instead he calls for a transnational body to act as a police force, collating information and passing it on. That makes sense. As does sports creating the right culture themselves. Parry says: &quot;It isn&apos;t always about years of painstaking evidence. A large part is about making it hard for stings to happen. The British Horseracing Authority has the best integrity unit of all. If they gather intelligence prior to a race they send a security officer to a jockey to say: we are watching you. That&apos;s a big disincentive for criminals.&quot; It sounds counterintuitive, but legalising betting in China, India, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia \u2013 which feeds so much match-fixing \u2013 would also help. If the history of 1960s Britain is any guide, the street bookies would dwindle and it would be easier to follow the money. But it remains a pipe dream. On Saturday Sepp Blatter insisted that match-fixing affects a tiny percentage of games. But we have seen how interest in leagues across Asia, including China, has dwindled because of the problem. It could yet happen here. Sportradar, which monitors betting markets for Uefa among others, fears up to 1% of matches are fixed every week in Europe \u2013 that&apos;s 10 a week. As Forrest points out: &quot;It&apos;s also worrying that many cases, such as the Bochum investigation, which began by looking at prostitution, come to light only by accident. It adds to the fear that this is the tip of the iceberg.&quot; That should make us all pause. Match-fixing could be even bigger than we think. And we may yet be the parents who found their child was smoking marijuana, when they had already moved on to crack cocaine."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/feb/11/ten-digital-strategists-watch-2013", "sentences": ["Christel Quek (Singapore) Christel Quek works as a global social marketing manager at Havas Media in Singapore.", "She was chosen as a finalist in the category of &quot;Best Young Talent&quot; by the Interactive Advertising Bureau of Singapore in 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-11T12:56:00Z", "title": "Ten digital strategists to watch in 2013", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Careers"], "article": "In the long history of advertising, digital strategy is only a recent development.

The sharply different priorities of the main political parties (within government as much as between government and opposition) have been outlined sharply, and the Whitehall watchers have found plenty to interest them. Ultimately, though, a bigger question for the country than what it all means in Westminster is what it means for the future of education reform and for schools. Do the sighs of relief in staff rooms across the country reflect a weariness with change, a fear of more demanding qualifications or something else? I think that perhaps the reasons run deeper. There are some areas of public life \u2013 pensions reform is a good example \u2013 where an element of political consensus is not only desirable but essential. If the issues are sufficiently long term and complex, the number of people affected is large enough and if those people need to have confidence in a consistent framework, then stability across several elections is necessary.Some elements of education policy are like that too. They are the &apos;tectonic plates&apos; of the system \u2013 both the foundations on which everything else is built, and the cause of earthquakes if moved too quickly. Among these foundations are the national curriculum, the examinations and testing systems and the school funding model. Think back over the last 20 years and every newsworthy education crisis \u2013 the periodic strikes and delivery problems associated with SATs, the curriculum 2000 A-level problems, the school funding crisis of 2003 \u2013 have been associated with movements in these &apos;tectonic plates&apos;. But the reason for caution in reform in these areas runs deeper than a political need to avoid bad headlines. Changes to funding, curriculum, testing and examinations are sufficiently fundamental from a school&apos;s perspective that they absorb much of the energy and attention of teachers, and particularly of school leaders, for an extended period of time. You can imagine that if as a school you are having to rethink and re-plan everything you teach, year group by year group, you will be able to focus on little else. As a leader, you must make sure that your school&apos;s schemes of work comprehensively prepare young people to succeed in new syllabuses and that every teacher properly understands the content and the expectations. So you will gear the training days you have at your disposal, the staff meetings and the management of performance to making sure this happens. For a time, the job of improving the quality of classroom teaching gets less attention as a result. Unfortunately, to move one or more of the &apos;tectonic plates&apos; is the easiest and most obvious reform for a government to undertake. It is far easier to see how to make a significant impact through that route than through any other. As a result, in every period of three years since the Education Reform Act of 1988, at least one of these areas has been undergoing fundamental reform. Of course, some of this reform has been of great importance. And it is easy to see more generally why, seeing real problems in schools, successive governments have calculated that the benefits of reform outweigh the costs. But the cumulative effect has been that very great time and energy has been expended on managing and implementing these changes, some of which reverse earlier reforms either wholly or in part. Compare that to many of the highest performing school systems in the world. Finland, where following deep reform of curriculum and teaching in the 1960s, there has been great stability for some decades; Singapore, where a consistent and only slowly evolving strategy has been followed since the 1950s; Ontario, where a 2007 White Paper setting out the government&apos;s programme for the four years which were to follow was a simple 10-page document detailing how the approach of the previous four years would be maintained and deepened. Creating the outstanding school system that the country needs will undoubtedly require a degree of political consensus and stability of policy that does not yet exist. The key task of improving an education system is to make it more likely that more teachers succeed with more children tomorrow than they did today. Making a reality of that requires a stable context in which school teachers and leaders can focus on the task: raising expectations (of teachers and pupils), allowing time for teachers to extend their subject knowledge, improve their pedagogical skill and engage with the evidence and making sure that more of teachers&apos; energy is focused on pupils, their work and their progress. So all of us working in education should take the decision to stick with GCSEs as a major opportunity. With less need to focus on an entirely new qualification, we have the opportunity to show that the drive to raise standards and improve the education system can be led better by the teaching profession than by the government. The energy that would have been absorbed by preparing for a new qualification can now be devoted to the most important thing of all \u2013 continuing to improve teaching and learning. If we can make a success of that, then perhaps it will be possible to drive a new political consensus: that reducing the amount of government-led change and creating greater stability for teachers to lead reform and improve their practice might be a better way to create better schools.

Following the revelation of the existence of a detention facility known as Camp 1391 in 2003, Israel said three years later that it no longer held prisoners in secret outside of international legal norms. The Zygier case suggests the Israeli government has not stuck to that promise. Even the location of Camp 1391 was airbrushed from aerial images. An Israeli court ruled at the time that the facility \u2013 run by Israel&apos;s domestic intelligence agency Shin Bet, used to house Palestinian prisoners with no access to their families and designated a military secret \u2013 held its inmates in substandard conditions. When the UN Committee Against Torture reported on conditions in Israeli jails in 2009, it noted that while Israel had said the &quot;secret detention and interrogation facility&quot; had not been used since 2006 it had rejected a request to inspect the prison. The report added: &quot;The State party should ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its control in the future, as a secret detention centre is per se a breach of the Convention [on torture]. The State party should investigate and disclose the existence of any other such facility and the authority under which it has been established.&quot; Although it might be argued that cell 15 at Israel&apos;s Ayalon prison, where Zygier was held before his death, was not a secret detention facility like Camp 1391, the fact that he was held in conditions of complete isolation and without access to a lawyer, with his guards not even knowing who their prisoner was, effectively created a &quot;secret prison&quot; within a prison. The Zygier case is not the first where Israel has evaded international legal norms in incarcerating perceived enemies of the state. A precedent for the Zygier case was that of Marcus Klingberg, an Israeli chemical weapons researcher, who was discovered to be spying for the Soviet Union. In 1983, he was lured to an undisclosed location after being told he was going to Singapore to investigate a fire at a chemical plant, kidnapped, tortured and imprisoned after a secret trial under a false identity. He was eventually released to live in France. The last known case with similar features involved the kidnap in Ukraine by Mossad and subsequent detention without trial of Dirar Abu Sisi, a Hamas figure accused of being a senior bombmaker. Abu Sisi vanished after boarding a train in February 2011, only to resurface in Israel three weeks later in detention. In that case, too, an Israeli court issued a gag order on his detention. Abu Sisi was ultimately accused of masterminding Hamas&apos;s rocket programme and training fighters in the Gaza Strip. He is charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder and weapons production. In some respects the Zygier case raises even more serious questions. As Bill van Esveld, a Human Rights Watch researcher who has been following the case, told the Guardian secret detention without trial and without access to family and lawyers is a serious breach of Israel&apos;s obligations under international law. Israeli journalists, too, have raised questions over how a prisoner who was supposed to have been monitored 24 hours a day was able to kill himself and in what circumstances. This issue was also raised by Israeli MP Nitzan Horowitz, who wrote to Israel&apos;s deputy attorney general in 2010 seeking information about Prisoner X and guarantees about his wellbeing when the existence of a Prisoner X was first disclosed. He was told the man&apos;s wellbeing and safety was being safeguarded. As Horowitz wrote in his letter at the time: &quot;Keeping a prisoner or detainee from contact with all others and from the outside world over a long period of time is fraught with many dangers. &quot;Besides the terrible fear of violating the rights of a human being who has no contact with the outside world, a report of the prison service and the public security ministry determined that long-term imprisonment in isolation causes a great deal of physical and psychological damage, to the point of deeply psychotic reactions. &quot;Even when it is necessary to keep a prisoner separate, everything must be done to ensure that this will not lead to keeping him in utter isolation and depriving him of all contact with other human beings. &quot;These principles are not being applied in the case of &apos;Mr. X.&apos; Besides the isolation, such a complete blackout concerning the arrest of a person and perhaps his trial too is unacceptable. Secret arrests and trials are unacceptable in a free democratic country; they pose a tangible threat to the rule of law and deeply harm the public&apos;s trust in the legal system.&quot; What has made the Prisoner X case even more serious is that the office of Israel&apos;s prime minister attempted to coerce journalists into not reporting on the case for no better reason than to save the &quot;embarrassment of a certain agency&quot; \u2013 in other words Mossad."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/feb/14/google-doodle-google", "sentences": ["The tallest is the Singapore Flyer in Singapore, which reaches a height of 165 metres \u2013 30 metres higher than the London Eye."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-14T15:05:00Z", "title": "George Ferris: Google reinvents the wheel with a Valentine's Day doodle", "tags": ["Google doodle", "Valentine's Day", "Google", "World news"], "article": "Google is celebrating Valentine&apos;s Day and George Ferris&apos;s birthday with a two-in-one doodle.

Our students can add value to their professional Acca qualifications by completing a project that enhances their skills in research and analysis \u2013 and earns them a BSc in Applied Accounting. Since 2000, when the partnership began, 16,544 students have graduated, most of them aged between 20 and 30. All the evidence suggests they are dramatically changing their lives, and those of their families. I have attended graduation ceremonies around the world and the enthusiastic support of the extended family for the students participating in this programme is obvious \u2013 they are always bursting with pride and pleasure. More than 234,000 students worldwide are registered for the Brookes degree: while 50,000 are studying in the UK, it is in the developing countries that the open and flexible nature of the programme delivers the most benefit. We have students studying in war zones such as Afghanistan, in many African countries, in Pakistan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore and, notably, China, where there are currently 19,000 students registered for the BSc. Many graduates opt to move to another country to work, their mobility enhanced by their qualifications. What makes their degrees so portable is the confidence generated by rigorous quality control \u2013 the work is marked in the UK so that the same standards apply globally. The course is challenging, requiring a huge level of determination, but if students work hard the rewards are significant, both personally and professionally. Many students are studying alongside full-time jobs and family responsibilities. There&apos;s a comparison to be made with the &quot;night school&quot; generation who changed their lives in post-war Britain through part-time study. Graduates are properly proud of the difference their qualifications are making. Ronald Otukol, who studied in Uganda, works as a partnership auditor at Compassion International, a post he obtained after completing his degree in 2009. He says: &quot;The international recognition of Oxford Brookes was a driving factor for me to take the degree. In Uganda, employers prefer their employees to have a degree in addition to a professional qualification.&quot; A Masters of Business Administration was also launched in 2003; the programme is taught through blended learning, and Acca members have automatic entry. Recent research from the Sutton Trust makes clear the career benefits of postgraduate qualification, and this programme provides another opportunity for students worldwide to enhance their life chances. Key to the success of the joint venture between Brookes and Acca is the vision that is shared: together we aim to widen access while ensuring that the standards of teaching and assessment are rigorous."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/feb/15/music-alliance-pact-february", "sentences": ["SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Halcyon - Building With SticksOne of the artists we&apos;ve got on our radar this year is Halcyon (Zhong Ren Koh), who&apos;s managed to come out just a little more broken in Singapore&apos;s cookie cutter society."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-15T09:17:22Z", "title": "February's best music from across the MAP", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Indie", "Culture"], "article": "Right-click on the song title to download an MP3, or grab a zip file of the full 39-track compilation through Ge.tt here.  ARGENTINA: ZonaindieThe Omelettes - Perfect WaveThe Omelettes&apos; sophomore album seeks to part from the 60s British sound of their first work and the result is something much more psychedelic and introspective. Perfect Wave is one of our favorite tracks from the new record, The Drawing &amp; The Traveller. You can also watch a video of their song Mondays here.  AUSTRALIA: Who The Bloody Hell Are They?Them Swoops - Too Fast For LoveNever trust a happy song, right? While Tame Impala are still trumping the globe with Lonerism and Gotye&apos;s break-up song is STILL unfortunately stalking us everywhere, we do make mood-lifting songs here in Australia. Indie-pop ain&apos;t a dirty word, especially when bands like Them Swoops make tracks like this. Too Fast For Love will probably sound like the first time you heard The Shins. Felt good, hey? We&apos;re not such a sombre bunch after all.  AUSTRIA: Walzerk\u00f6nigSex Jams - Shark Vs AppleThe alternate girl/boy singing on Shark Vs Apple and its saucy, playful lyrics make it an instant favourite. Basically, the first single from the new Sex Jams album Trouble, Honey is what Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta would have sounded like had Grease been a noise-rock musical. Half of Sex Jams also play in May 2012&apos;s MAP band and this year&apos;s Eurosonic favourites Mile Me Deaf.  BRAZIL: Meio DesligadoSambanzo - Xang\u00f4Sambanzo is one of the projects of saxophonist Thiago Fran\u00e7a, also a member of Met\u00e1 Met\u00e1 and collaborator of artists such as Gui Amabis and Romulo Froes. Xang\u00f4 is taken from the album Eti\u00f3pia, which features some experimental music with strong influences of jazz, Candombl\u00e9, Afrobeat and rock.  CANADA: Quick Before It MeltsBarbarosa - Sinking WestThe title track of Barbarosa&apos;s debut EP calls up images of the Wild West - rugged, romantic, ruthless and without rules. Sinking West&apos;s menacing undertone is brightened by modern pop sensibilities, and the playing is fast and fierce. The full EP is available now on the band&apos;s website.  CHILE: Super 45Perrosky - A Mil MillasPerrosky, a duet formed by brothers \u00c1lvaro and Alejandro G\u00f3mez, offer a local interpretation of the music styles that gave birth to rock &apos;n&apos; roll in the USA. Their fifth album Vivos is swarmed by distorted guitars, vocal effects and, of course, a great set of songs. Our highlight is the touching blues ballad A Mil Millas (&quot;A Thousand Miles Away&quot;), which depicts a man searching for himself but whose possibilities seem blocked to him.  CHINA: WooozyTengger Cavalry - War HorseDeeply influenced by the nomadic culture of north Asia, Tengger Cavalry&apos;s music evokes ancient times when wandering warriors, steeds and wolves danced across the great grasslands. The melody of horse-head fiddle, the rhythm of heavy drum, the echo of Mongolian throat singing and the distortion of guitar all create an expressive scene of pagan culture.  COLOMBIA: El Parlante AmarilloLa Pulpafonic - CameliaJam for the ears, that&apos;s how we can describe the sound of La Pulpafonic. A project born in Bogot\u00e1, it aims to present Colombian folklore within a new context and a new flavor: the taste of the fruit pulp. Electronic sounds literally extracted from fruits, mixed with an eclectic explosion of dance rhythms from this century. From their first work released in 2012, we squeeze out the song Camelia.  DENMARK: All ScandinavianFreja Loeb - W.O.M.D.Earlier this month Freja Loeb followed up her 2011 debut album Odyssey with the release of a new EP titled W.O.M.D. Where the album stood on the shoulders of the 1980s pop scene, the EP finds its sources of inspiration in the same decade&apos;s rock scenes. Here&apos;s the title track as a MAP exclusive.  DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: La CaseteraLas Acevedo - Cena En La TerrazaLove is still in the air, after a Valentine&apos;s Day full of fresh romantic tunes brought by several Ibero-American bands. Las Acevedo, the hippie twin sisters of folk, present this breezy love song about dining in terraces, chasing fireflies and packing away your significant other inside a trunk with flowers in their hair.  ECUADOR: Plan ArteriaMarley Muerto  - Dorado Salmon Violeta (featuring Frances Possieri)Marley Muerto is led by Daniel Pasquel, a musician and producer who was born on the same day that Bob Marley died. This project sees him play with a range of electronic sounds and collaborate with some important local artists. Pararmar is his debut album released while his band, Can Can, takes a break.  ENGLAND: The Guardian Music BlogGNOD - Visions Of LoadTaken from GNOD&apos;s forthcoming album Chaudelande (released on February 25 by Rocket Recordings), Visions Of Load captures neatly - that is to say, powerfully and sprawlingly - the krautrockin&apos;, shoegazin&apos;, prog-metallic sludginess of this Salford band at their most freakily magnificent. &quot;It recalls Can&apos;s ga-ga go-go music while the singer yelps like Alan Vega doused in even more echo,&quot; said our New Band of the Day writer, who nevertheless promised that, notwithstanding the far-out sonics and instrumental melee, you could still dance to it. He just didn&apos;t specify what type of shoes you might need.  ESTONIA: Rada7Candy Empire - LuckyCandy Empire is a new band founded late 2011 by restless multi-instrumentalist Ervin Trofimov of acclaimed experimental rock band Opium Flirt. Trofimov has previously recorded in various genres such as instrumental prog-rock, acoustic folk and electronic pop, but Candy Empire&apos;s sound can be described as a futuristic version of Blondie with Neil Young on guitar. They have unveiled their new single Lucky with a colorful animated video.  FINLAND: GlueHexvessel - Woods To ConjureInspired by the mysticism of Finnish nature, Hexvessel mixes an acoustic folk vibe with psychedelic and electric doom sounds, creating dense, spaced-out atmospherics. Woods To Conjure is included in the band&apos;s second album No Holier Temple. Hexvessel will be heading to the SXSW festival in Texas in March.  GERMANY: ColtranPollyester - Concierge D&apos;AmourThe most advanced band in Munich&apos;s music scene is Pollyester. Although Polly Lapkovskaja and Manuel da Coll play in several other groups, the duo found a unique and remarkable style on their latest record Earthly Powers. Relying heavily on a groovy rhythm section with drums and bass, the rediscovered synths and Polly&apos;s vocals add up to something between disco and New Wave, and has been met with critical acclaim.  ICELAND: Rj\u00f3minnMorgan Kane - NineNine is a song about a guy trying to get to a girl to tell her that she was right and strong, when he was wrong. Morgan Kane&apos;s songwriting is influenced by Serge Gainsbourg.  INDIA: NH7Apu And The Dentist - No Messages For RumiApu And The Dentist is the experimental rock project of Mumbai-based duo Saurabh Roy and Achint Thakkar. With this track, which also features local musicians Suraj Manik, Jeremy D&apos;Souza and Krishna Jhaveri, they have created a psychedelic rock soundscape. A debut EP is slated for release in 2013.  INDONESIA: DeathrockstarBackwood Sun - Seven ShadowsBackwood Sun is one of the most promising indie acts in Jakarta. The band are often described as an Indonesian version of Fleet Foxes, but even if they are heavily influenced by them, it doesn&apos;t stop Backwood Sun making humble, honest music.  IRELAND: Harmless NoiseGirl Band - Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My GarageFew could predict a post-punk version of a techno track that took its vocal sample from a hip hop song. This cover version, however, was recorded for the third and final Quompilation album of Irish bands&apos; favourite songs. Blawan&apos;s original Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage is a psychotic, six-minute stamp through disturbia and the four males of Dublin&apos;s Girl Band managed to eke out almost two extra minutes, using that time and their canny production values to flesh out and reanimate bare bones, breathing life through a spirited reiteration of the vocal hook.  ITALY: PolaroidBrothers In Law - (Shadow II) Leave MeBrothers In Law is a young three-piece band from Pesaro, on the always surprising Italian east coast. The dirt of the sea has sneaked dirty sounds into their songs. File under: dream-pop bandits, C86 catchers, Captured Tracks lovers. Brothers In Law just released their debut album Hard Times For Dreamers and they have been invited to play at next month&apos;s SXSW. A dream coming true.  JAPAN: Make Believe MelodiesHotel Mexico - A.I. In DreamsHotel Mexico, hailing from the historic city of Kyoto, have been one of the most chirped about bands in the Japanese indie scene for several years now. Many cite them as the first chillwave group in Japan, but that label does them a disservice. A.I. In Dreams, taken from new album Her Decorated Post Love, is laid-back but never lazy, the guitars creating a lush sound while voices dart by in the back. It is a song rich in detail, something this outfit excels at.  MALTA: Stagedive MaltaThe Suburbanite - Blow My MindThe Suburbanite is the project of Maltese-Canadian Robert Pisani, backed by a floating collective involving a number of other local band members who have helped shape their sound. A Field Guide To The Suburbanite is a seven-song collection which embraces the spirit and naivety of the past; a frolic on the beach, the first love, Saturday nights indoors... all with hummable melodies. Listening to that debut EP is like taking a walk through Willy Wonka&apos;s chocolate factory, without the Oompa-Loompas chanting those annoying moralising ditties.  MEXICO: Red Bull Panam\u00e9rika60 Tigres - PicosoOne of the country&apos;s best live acts, 60 Tigres started as a six-piece in 2005 in the northern city of Monterrey and has had many member variations since then. They mix Latin grooves with great melody lines, sparkling keyboards and the heritage of early-90s strident indie guitars. Take a chance with their anthemic, danceable new single Picoso.  NETHERLANDS: Subbacultcha!APRIL - The Rise And Fall Of A Beautiful BirdLast year I had the privilege to witness APRIL&apos;s first ever gig. Amidst the seedy rock &apos;n&apos; roll crowd this enigmatic duo generated plenty of attention - both frontwoman and man rockin&apos; high heels while channelling Bowie-esque vibes like it was nobody&apos;s business. On stage it soon became clear that their originality did not stop at their taste in fashion, combining drum computers with reverberant guitar melodies, groovy basslines and intricate, contrasting vocals. With their new single, due to be released on February 23 via Subroutine Records, APRIL has replaced their drum machine for a real drummer and their melodramatic side for a sound that embodies the same confidence they project in a live setting.  PERU: SoTBRafo R\u00e1ez - Los Regalos Del VientoRafo R\u00e1ez has been creating songs since high school, with his catchy compositions making him one of the most beloved musicians in Peru. With eight albums under his belt, Rafo&apos;s music has gone through rock, trova, punk and Peruvian folklore. And with a penchant for poetry, they have also been part of theater plays.  POLAND: \u0141ukasz Ku\u015bmierz WeblogPo\u0142udnice vs. Liquid Molly - Dolina, DolinuszkaPo\u0142udnice are a female vocal group who sing traditional, folklore, Polish and Ukrainian (sometimes Belarusian) songs. On their album Po\u0142udnice / Elektronice, they couple these with modern electronic productions from guest musicians - Dolina, Dolinuszka features heavy bass beats from Liquid Molly. If you think about it logically it should result in disaster, but it is in fact majestic.  PORTUGAL: Posso Ouvir Um Disco?Little Friend - Sunken LowJohn Almeida is not a freshman as a musician or a composer. Before this first solo single, he played with some major Portuguese indie artists (The Weatherman, We Trust) who, as a sign of friendship, have returned their gratitude by appearing on his first solo record. The video for Sunken Low was directed by Lewis Arnold and has Jo Hartley (This Is England, Dead Man&apos;s Shoes, The Young Victoria) as the protagonist.  PUERTO RICO: Puerto Rico IndieLos Pepiniyoz - Entre Las ParedesLos Pepiniyoz have been making their brand of high-energy, melodic punk for more than a decade now - writing songs that reach for the heart without losing any attitude. Throughout the years the band has served as a sort of workshop for a lot of local rockers and now, after a long hiatus, have returned to the boricua scene with a new line-up and a solid three-song EP. Entre Las Paredes is the catchiest tune of the bunch and will probably make you lust for new material from Los Pepiniyoz.  ROMANIA: Babylon NoiseSubumbra - Good People Are RainbowsSubumbra started like an art audio-video project, a punk band made up of three brothers who recorded their lo-fi songs in a poor home studio. Recently, the project took a new direction as they began to use more electronic instruments and sampling. Subumbra is about taking the core of punk music and merging it with contemporary influences such as chillstep, dubstep and hip hop.  RUSSIA: Big EchoDasha Shults - KiteDasha Shults, a 16-year-old wonder from Saint-Petersburg, has taken her first steps from covering her favorites by Ellie Goulding and Laura Marling to making her own simple, beautiful songs. She sings about kites, nightmares and, of course, love.  SCOTLAND: The Pop CopKevin Harper - Kingdom Of WiresInfluenced by warm, fuzzy guitar bands of the American West Coast, Kevin Harper first appeared in the Music Alliance Pact in March 2011 under the guise of Little Eskimos, a solo project that evolved into a group. He&apos;s back on his own again, not that you could tell from this talented multi-instrumentalist&apos;s canny knack of sounding like a full band is at work. Mr Harper is probably one of the most accomplished pop songwriters in Scotland, yet he&apos;s still little-known in his native land. If there&apos;s any justice, his forthcoming debut solo album Kingdom Of Wires should change all that.  SINGAPORE: I&apos;m Waking Up To...Halcyon - Building With SticksOne of the artists we&apos;ve got on our radar this year is Halcyon (Zhong Ren Koh), who&apos;s managed to come out just a little more broken in Singapore&apos;s cookie cutter society. We love the singer-songwriter, and we love even more that Halcyon has broken out from that particular mould to become an emerging multi-instrumentalist. His arrangements are delicate and achingly heartfelt - sometimes they work and sometimes they don&apos;t, but it&apos;s more real than most of the crap out there.  SOUTH KOREA: Korean IndieFrom The Airport - ColorsElectro rock duo From The Airport formed in 2012 and they&apos;re not afraid to throw other genres in the mix. Second single Everyone&apos;s Alright was released last month but here we get to hear them as they first came out with electro-pop debut single Colors, which brought the two producers plenty of positive attention when it was unleashed in October.  SPAIN: MusikornerMegaafon\u00eda - Se\u00f1or Guti\u00e9rrezFormed in 2005, Megaafon\u00eda have been active until this month, when they decided to split due to creative differences, although they will remain friends. They released two albums, Despechado and Tutto, and we will certainly miss their fresh pop (influenced by the likes of ELO, Xavier Cugat and Bom Bom Chip) and their irreverent and highly ironic lyrics.  SWEDEN: Ja Ja JaD\u00f6dens Dal - Bakom Stj\u00e4rnor, Bakom TidenD\u00f6dens Dal is a duo with a fingertip feel and fondness for gloomy, instrumental and really rather mind-boggling electronica. They first came to our attention last year with their brilliantly dark debut single Det St\u00e5r Skrivet, and now they&apos;re back with the pitch-black follow-up Bakom Stj\u00e4rnor, Bakom Tiden. Both tracks come from the album G\u00e5 Ensam F\u00f6rbi Horisonten, released this month via Flora &amp; Fauna.  SWITZERLAND: 78sLast Leaf Down - Fake Lights In The SkyLast Leaf Down is a shoegaze outfit from Solothurn. Heavenly, ethereal sounds and distinct, dreamy vocals make them deserving of your attention. Here&apos;s their new track Fake Lights In The Sky.  TURKEY: WEARTBEATBayku\u015f - Gel YeterBayku\u015f (once known as Kaotik) comes from the grey city of Ankara where our grunge acts always sprout fertile. Anatolian tunes bound up with post-grunge styling are common but Bayku\u015f succeed in making their sound more solid and more garage-like. Gel Yeter is catchy enough to start a pogo party on its own.  UNITED STATES: We Listen For YouThe Long Wives - The Hollow FinThe Long Wives&apos; standout track The Hollow Fin is deceivingly gentle. The softly-plucked guitar and the eased restraint of the vocals invite the listener to get close to the speaker and its warm, wispy, radiant sounds. But there&apos;s more to this track than meets the ear. Like most great pieces of art that explore the juxtaposition between surface appearances and the evils that can lurk below, the power comes from an unidentifiable element onto which the listener just can&apos;t seem to put their finger.  VENEZUELA: M\u00fasica y M\u00e1sLos Paranoias - No Hace FaltaAfter almost two years of absence, Los Paranoias return to the scene with No Hace Falta, a single released last month and the first cut of their next studio album Que Se Activen Las Alarmas, scheduled to come out in the coming months."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/15/singapore-crisis-immigration-financial-crisis", "sentences": ["Like many other Singaporeans, her life revolves around work, family and the stress of making ends meet in a nation that works the longest hours in the world.", "But lately her life has taken on a more immediate concern: a government initiative to increase Singapore&apos;s population by a third by 2030, a move that would see citizenship granted to more foreigners and squash the native population to just over half the total.", "People are getting increasingly fed up because our daily lives are affected.&quot; Singapore has long been heralded as the success story of south-east Asia, a small island nation less than half the geographical land size of Greater London that in just 50 years has transformed from colonial backwater to one of the world&apos;s most formidable economic powerhouses.", "Skyrocketing housing prices, overcrowding, long working hours, low birth rates and an ageing population \u2013 that the government terms Singapore&apos;s &quot;silver tsunami&quot; \u2013 are all major contributors to discontent often been focused on the country&apos;s rapid immigration.", "Under a government white paper \u2013 which was approved last week despite widespread public anger \u2013 Singapore will aim to increase its population to 6.9 million people over the next 20 years by granting permanent residency to 30,000 people and allowing an inflow of some 25,000 new citizens every year.", "&quot;We are producing too few babies, our society is ageing, and if we do nothing, our population will soon start shrinking,&quot; said Singapore&apos;s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong.", "&quot;Singapore must continue to develop and upgrade to remain a key node in the network of global cities, a vibrant place where jobs and opportunities are created.&quot; It is the government&apos;s focus on Singapore&apos;s economy, rather than its people, that has stirred much of the public&apos;s discontent.", "Singapore is the third most expensive city in Asia.", "The ruling People&apos;s Action Party (Pap), in power since independence in 1965, is seemingly on a one-track mission to maintain its own rule, despite having heavily lost a recent byelection and potentially standing to lose more, says Singapore expert Michael Barr of Australia&apos;s Flinders University.", "&quot;Just like a multinational company&apos;s CEO has bonuses tied to the rise and fall of share prices, ministers and civil servants have bonuses tied to economic growth in Singapore.", "&quot;There is no known employment protection for local workers here \u2013 people can be easily replaced at the workplace \u2026 [and] workers have been known to be replaced by foreigners, as many employers are now foreigners as well.&quot; Racial tensions already run high, not least between the ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian Singaporeans who already make up the city-state, but also among new immigrants, says Barr.", "Local opposition politician Nicole Seah, who ran as the youngest female candidate in the 2011 general elections, recently said that the &quot;Singapore Inc&quot; brand cultivated by the government has created a &quot;transient state where people from all over come, make their fortunes and leave&quot;.", "She added: &quot;The policies over the past decades have created an erosion of our social roots, widespread resentment, and a loss of who we are as Singaporeans.", "We have been taught to prioritise money-making practicality over what it means to have a solid culture.&quot; The bubbling discontent in Singapore has recently been compounded by a string of scandals causing some outsiders to wonder if the Asian utopia so carefully crafted by the nation&apos;s so-called founder, Lee Kuan Yew, is finally crumbling."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-15T11:19:24Z", "title": "Singapore protest: 'Unfamiliar faces are crowding our land'", "tags": ["Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Liane Ng is 25 and single, works 60 hours a week, and until recently, shared a bedroom with her grandmother. Like many other Singaporeans, her life revolves around work, family and the stress of making ends meet in a nation that works the longest hours in the world. But lately her life has taken on a more immediate concern: a government initiative to increase Singapore&apos;s population by a third by 2030, a move that would see citizenship granted to more foreigners and squash the native population to just over half the total. &quot;I love my country,&quot; says the advertising executive. &quot;[But] the cost of living is high, the income gap is widening, transport is failing and unfamiliar faces are crowding our land. People are getting increasingly fed up because our daily lives are affected.&quot; Singapore has long been heralded as the success story of south-east Asia, a small island nation less than half the geographical land size of Greater London that in just 50 years has transformed from colonial backwater to one of the world&apos;s most formidable economic powerhouses. But that gain has come at increasing cost. Skyrocketing housing prices, overcrowding, long working hours, low birth rates and an ageing population \u2013 that the government terms Singapore&apos;s &quot;silver tsunami&quot; \u2013 are all major contributors to discontent often been focused on the country&apos;s rapid immigration. The city-state currently has a population of 5.3 million, and is now more densely populated than Hong Kong. Under a government white paper \u2013 which was approved last week despite widespread public anger \u2013 Singapore will aim to increase its population to 6.9 million people over the next 20 years by granting permanent residency to 30,000 people and allowing an inflow of some 25,000 new citizens every year. New social programmes, including marriage and parenthood initiatives, as well as infrastructure schemes, will accommodate the burgeoning population, with immigration calibrated to retain its current ethnic ratios. &quot;We are producing too few babies, our society is ageing, and if we do nothing, our population will soon start shrinking,&quot; said Singapore&apos;s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong. &quot;Singapore must continue to develop and upgrade to remain a key node in the network of global cities, a vibrant place where jobs and opportunities are created.&quot; It is the government&apos;s focus on Singapore&apos;s economy, rather than its people, that has stirred much of the public&apos;s discontent. Singapore is the third most expensive city in Asia. The ruling People&apos;s Action Party (Pap), in power since independence in 1965, is seemingly on a one-track mission to maintain its own rule, despite having heavily lost a recent byelection and potentially standing to lose more, says Singapore expert Michael Barr of Australia&apos;s Flinders University. &quot;Pap has always presented itself as a party above vested interests \u2026 [but] that is not washing anymore,&quot; says Barr. &quot;Just like a multinational company&apos;s CEO has bonuses tied to the rise and fall of share prices, ministers and civil servants have bonuses tied to economic growth in Singapore. And we&apos;re talking about million-dollar bonuses here and more, so there&apos;s a lot at stake.&quot; Dissent over the white paper has been huge. Social media, newspapers, blogs and even parliament itself have been rife with commentary, and a rare public protest \u2013 with over 3,500 already planning to attend \u2013 has been scheduled for Saturday. &quot;There is this fear that foreigners will eventually replace and take over our country,&quot; explains protest organiser Gilbert Goh, who hopes for a referendum. &quot;There is no known employment protection for local workers here \u2013 people can be easily replaced at the workplace \u2026 [and] workers have been known to be replaced by foreigners, as many employers are now foreigners as well.&quot; Racial tensions already run high, not least between the ethnic Chinese, Malay and Indian Singaporeans who already make up the city-state, but also among new immigrants, says Barr. Some of that tension is due to the country&apos;s focus on economics rather than culture. Local opposition politician Nicole Seah, who ran as the youngest female candidate in the 2011 general elections, recently said that the &quot;Singapore Inc&quot; brand cultivated by the government has created a &quot;transient state where people from all over come, make their fortunes and leave&quot;. She added: &quot;The policies over the past decades have created an erosion of our social roots, widespread resentment, and a loss of who we are as Singaporeans. We have been taught to prioritise money-making practicality over what it means to have a solid culture.&quot; The bubbling discontent in Singapore has recently been compounded by a string of scandals causing some outsiders to wonder if the Asian utopia so carefully crafted by the nation&apos;s so-called founder, Lee Kuan Yew, is finally crumbling. Most young professionals still live at home because they can&apos;t afford to move out, the government has had to subsidise speed-dating schemes to encourage partnerships, and abortion rates among married women now account for over half the total \u2013 as many families struggle to stay afloat. &quot;The government does not give allowance for people who are different from them and this is one of the reasons why we are so politically and creatively stunted,&quot; says Ng. &quot;My perspective is, I&apos;m different, I don&apos;t want to toe the line, and that&apos;s why we have to speak up and push through until something happens.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/us-news-blog/2013/feb/16/social-media-google", "sentences": ["This month, events and activities will be taking place in New York \u2013 where the event is supported by the Guardian \u2013 Copenhagen, Hamburg, Lagos, Miami, Milan, Paris, Singapore, Tokyo and Washington DC."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-16T19:30:00Z", "title": "Social Media Week set to be 'Open and Connected' around the world", "tags": ["Social media", "Google", "Ford", "Reddit", "US news", "World news", "New York", "Miami", "Washington DC", "Technology", "Technology sector"], "article": "Social Media Week kicks off in cities across the globe from Monday, with a range of events in the US, Europe, Africa and Asia aimed at exploring the social, cultural and economic impact of social media and networking.

It&apos;s both an inspiration and the perfect accompaniment to this year&apos;s global theme &apos;Open and Connected&apos;. &quot;We couldn&apos;t be more excited to bring this community together once again, and to connect them with an incredible lineup of diverse speakers, host organizations, global brands, public sectors organizations and nonprofits.&quot; Ford will be among the companies hosting events in New York, with its global head of social media, Scott Monty, due to make an announcement at an event at the Bloomberg building on Tuesday evening. Ford will discuss its social media efforts, which include the first automotive social movement, the Fiesta Movement, and Monty will discuss how brands can avoid pitfalls in the unpredictable social world. Google will also have a large presence, with a team from Google+ offering a masterclass in using Google Hangouts \u2013 its live chat tool. A number of media organisations have invested time and effort in using Hangouts to engage readers and their community; HuffPost Live uses the platform as a social two-way in its video service, while the Washington Post is among a number of media groups to have used the feature to engage with its users. In another highly anticipated event, Eli Pariser from Upworthy and Reddit&apos;s Alexis Ohanian will discuss the battle to protect free information on the internet, and the &quot;need to encourage&quot; governments and social networks to leave content people are creating unfiltered in a bid to preserve free speech.  Last year&apos;s February Social Media Week attracted more than 36,000 attendees, across 1,000 events, according to organisers. Some 2,500 speakers engaged in conversation across 12 cities, with hundreds of thousands of people engaging in events online."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/feb/17/andrew-rugasira-interview-good-african-coffee", "sentences": ["Photograph: Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images    He points to the transformations achieved in Singapore and South Korea: &quot;There was no aid, just financial institutions geared by government not only to lend but to lend technical support, who would fund their trade shows and exhibitions and marketing\u2026&quot; And he references the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang&apos;s book Kicking Away the Ladder, the story of how all major developed countries used interventionist and protectionist policies to get rich and now work to prevent underdeveloped countries doing the same."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-17T00:04:00Z", "title": "Andrew Rugasira: can coffee transform lives in Africa?", "tags": ["Trade and development", "Coffee", "Uganda", "Africa", "Social enterprises", "Society", "Global development", "Farming", "Business", "Supermarkets", "Waitrose", "Tesco", "J Sainsbury", "World news", "Business and finance", "Autobiography and memoir"], "article": "How can you tell when a story has ended? If it is an African story, such as the one Andrew Rugasira has to tell, closure is never likely to be satisfying or clear cut. Beginnings are more straightforward. Rugasira&apos;s once-upon-a-time moment came nearly a decade ago, when he had a vision to start a coffee company in his native Uganda. He would, he determined, become the first African to collect and roast and market and sell quality coffee direct to British supermarkets. And, by that example, he would demonstrate his certain beliefs: that it was trade, not aid, that transformed communities and that change was never an imposed solution, but a positive choice made by those whose lives would be most affected by it. The place Rugasira chose to base his coffee company, to start that story, the Rwenzori mountains \u2013 the Mountains of the Moon \u2013 looked a lot like a blank page. The lives of the 14,000 subsistence farmers who lived high above the town of Kasese, right on the war-torn border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, had never been the stuff of written record. Their narratives were of survival rather than progress. Ambition meant getting through the next day and the next week, in thrall as they were to the suddenly shifting front lines of brutal cross-border conflict and the vagaries of farming a little scrap of land without decent tools or any technology, without transport or access to market, barely growing enough to feed themselves and their children, waiting for agents or middlemen to pass through and buy some coffee beans, maybe soon, maybe not, and never for a price that seemed fair. Rugasira believed he could help to give the lives of those 14,000 farmers and their families a different shape. One that could take in measurable progress; that could see skills learned and retained in the community; that could reward consistent effort, introduce saving and planning and time horizons that included the real prospect of better lives for children and for grandchildren. The first step in rewriting those life stories would be to communicate an idea, Rugasira believed. So, aged 34, and after a career that had taken in event planning and business consultancy in Kampala, he went up into the mountains and started telling the farmers what he had in mind. He recalls the first of those meetings, with a group of community leaders, in his book, A Good African Story, which details the progress of his vision and his company, the ways in which it has succeeded and the ways in which it has failed. &quot;In Kasese, I shared my frustrations,&quot; he recalls, &quot;at Africans always being seen [in the west and sometimes at home] as nothing more than beggars: incapable, deprived, poor and helpless. With their help, I told them, I was determined to make a change, however small, to alter this outlook. But the project could only work if we did this together.&quot; At this point in Rugasira&apos;s speech, a young man who had been sitting quietly at the back of the room put up his hand to speak. &quot;My name is Charles Kahitson and I am from Nyakabingo in Rukoki sub-county,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to tell you, Mr Andrew, that I am in fact a model farmer. If you come to Kasese to work with model farmers then I am one and I am willing to work with you.&quot; And so it started. Over the next year, Rugasira, with the help of Kahitson and others, began to build up his network of farmers in the mountains who might share best farming practice, &quot;wet-processing&quot; coffee, rotating their crop, harvesting efficiently. At the same time, he helped to establish microfinance initiatives, particularly among women, promising a model of business in which his Good African coffee company would guarantee a consistent, fair market price and would share profits 50/50 with the farming community. In addition, Rugasira would go out into the world and sell their high-quality product and tell their story. I first saw Rugasira recounting the opening chapters of that story in 2005 in the unlikely setting of the terrace of the House of Lords, where he had been invited to speak about his initiative beside a banner that read &quot;Trade not Aid&quot;. Rugasira is a committed Christian, and a compelling orator, but he reserves much of his evangelism for the lessons of self-help, the wisdom of entrepreneurs, quoting as freely from business leaders he admires \u2013 Jack Welch of General Motors, Lee Kun-hee of Samsung \u2013 as from the Gospels. And that day, at the House of Lords, he could point to the minor miracle of his coffee on the shelves of Waitrose as evidence of the reality of his faith for those who doubted. Inspired by some of this message, a few weeks later I went out to the Mountains of the Moon to hear the tales of the farmers first hand. In Kasese, Rugasira introduced me to some of the stars of his 14,000-strong &quot;team&quot;. In turn, they proudly showed me the processing methods they had mastered, they talked of advances in yield and quality, the incremental improvements they had made to their one-room huts, and their eyes shone with possibility. Some stories stayed with me, like parables. There was the story of Charles Kahitson himself, who as a sideline from his coffee growing was experimenting with beekeeping, spreading the word about homemade hives, and honey, and imagining the Rwenzori valleys buzzing with life. (The only book Kahitson owned was on the technicalities of apiology and so enthralled was he by it that he had named his son Macmillan, after its publisher.) There was the tale, too, of Milenai Muhindo, who talked quietly in simple declarative sentences of the way, soon after her husband had died, she had seen her three brothers killed in front of her by a militia group from Congo, who also burned her home to the ground. With the coming of the coffee company, though, she had still found some place in her life, as a single mother and farmer, for hope. She had started a microfinance group among the local women; she showed me the little ledger of how their savings were growing week by week. There were many other stories like these and by the time I ended that visit, I felt I had a sense of what even the tiniest change might mean for these people and how it was beginning to be effected. In the years since then, I have seen Rugasira from time to time when he has been over in Britain, on his never-ending storytelling mission for contracts and capital. Those one-man trade delegations have sometimes appeared full of hope \u2013 as he secured further contracts with Sainsbury&apos;s and Tesco \u2013 and sometimes more desperate, as he sought to protect those hard-won agreements, beset by problems of financing and managing growth. He made good his promise to establish a coffee roasting plant to serve Rwenzori, proof that value could be added to the product where it was produced. He expanded to America, planned to grow the model into tea and chocolate, and he reported back on the small anecdotal changes in the lives of the farmers I had met \u2013 how this man had bought a bicycle, that one had now saved to send his daughters to a good school. A couple of years ago, six years since Good African was established, Rugasira took the surprising step of enrolling on an MSc course in African studies at Oxford University. Partly it was the fulfilment of an old promise he had made to himself and to his mother. Having studied at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London after school, he had been forced home immediately after graduation by news of the death of his father, aged 51. He laid aside plans for postgraduate work and was cast prematurely in the role of man of the house in a country still unhinged by the brutal regimes of Idi Amin and Milton Obote. Oxford was put on hold for 20 years. When he did take up his place, he left behind in Uganda his wife, Jackie, and five children, as well as his business. I saw him a couple of times while he was pursuing a spartan regime of gym and study, trying to run Good African and be a father and husband from afar. One result of that period of reflection was his\u00a0book. In a piece for the Times last week, a reviewer suggested the memoir was a piece of &quot;premature triumphalism&quot;, that the story of Good African was not only incomplete, but the model as yet unproved. Rugasira accepts that his timing might look odd in a landscape of business literature that tends to deal in unqualified success. Even so, he told me, when we met last week: &quot;I thought it was time to try to force a conversation. Everyone is suddenly talking about Africa being &apos;open for business&apos;. But nobody seems to want to define what that might mean.&quot; The book is full of Rugasira&apos;s vivid character, scholarly, argumentative and big-hearted, dismantling the agendas of NGOs, dwelling on the historical context of poor governance and corruption, detailing the ways in which real change in Africa is still an ambition rather than a reality. Its theme is not one of triumph, but of ongoing frustration and struggle. The context has changed since 2003, when Africa was still seen primarily as a place for charity rather than investment, but not always in useful ways. &quot;I think there are always two conversations taking place now,&quot; Rugasira says. &quot;One is among the observers of Africa, the investing class. They point to the McKinsey report, which says African economic growth is running at 6% or 7%, in which they have an interest\u2026 But there is also another conversation going on, this time on the continent, among the increasingly young population, who are still looking for work, looking for capital. It doesn&apos;t matter how many times young African entrepreneurs are told Africa is open for business. It is still business on somebody else&apos;s terms...&quot; Much of Rugasira&apos;s anger remains directed at the good intentions of foreign aid and ring-fenced investment, which focuses on nebulous &quot;capacity building&quot; without ever targeting support directly at small business or wealth creation. &quot;It is easier to plant a bore hole in some remote place and bring some media in to photograph it and say, look, these people have water. They are the same vulnerable, impoverished people, but now they have a bore hole. The question still has to be: how do you enable these people to build their own bore holes?&quot;     Attention to detail: Andrew Rugasira at the Good African coffee company\u2019s factory in\u00a0Kampala, Uganda. Photograph: Jonathan Torgovnik/Getty Images    He points to the transformations achieved in Singapore and South Korea: &quot;There was no aid, just financial institutions geared by government not only to lend but to lend technical support, who would fund their trade shows and exhibitions and marketing\u2026&quot; And he references the Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang&apos;s book Kicking Away the Ladder, the story of how all major developed countries used interventionist and protectionist policies to get rich and now work to prevent underdeveloped countries doing the same. Rugasira has close knowledge of that reality. Despite his indefatigable commitment, he has been beset with the African entrepreneur&apos;s catch-22. &quot;In order to grow you have to have a long-term market expectation, but you have no access to long-term capital. I had African banks asking me for letters of credit from Tesco. I had to explain that is not really how it works.&quot; As a result of this mismatch of finance and culture, Waitrose and Sainsbury&apos;s ended up delisting Good African last year. &quot;With Waitrose, we were just unable to meet its rate of sales; we didn&apos;t have the resources to do the promotion and marketing needed to expand.&quot; He hasn&apos;t given up hope of a return and in the meantime, as well as an expanding market in Africa, &quot;Tesco has said we will go from 118 stores to 630&quot;. As he has negotiated this journey, Rugasira has sometimes come close to defeat; he sold his house in Kampala and was forced to downshift with his family. There have been times when he has been unable to pay for the coffee brought to Kasese. But that in itself proved a lesson. &quot;It&apos;s funny,&quot; he says, &quot;but it was only when it became clear that we as a company were also vulnerable financially that the farmers could see that we were serious. We became real. When we said, &apos;Look, we can&apos;t pay you this week&apos;, they didn&apos;t walk away, as I feared. They said, &apos;OK, keep the coffee and pay me next week.&apos;&quot; Transformation, in this sense, he suggests, is full of unintended consequences. Having raised the quality and reliability of coffee production exponentially in Rwenzori, other bigger buyers have come in to compete. It gives him cause for hope, not despair. &quot;I said to my wife, Jackie, the things we have learned in the past eight years, where else on Earth could we have learned them? She agreed with me,&quot; he says and laughs. &quot;But she also wants it fixed this year. Otherwise she will be looking to see how many places I have sent my CV\u2026&quot; Given his commitment to change, Rugasira is often asked about political ambitions. He doesn&apos;t quite rule out the possibility but he is wary. &quot;I just want to be a good president of Good African coffee. Politics has too many takers.&quot; He is, if anything, a slightly more humble, perhaps wiser figure than he was when I first met him, though still as passionate. &quot;I have learned that I&apos;m not as important as I thought I was in this,&quot; he says. &quot;You begin to effect a change, but the change is bigger than you. There are successes, but you are never going to say you have completely succeeded.&quot; What he hopes his book shows, he says, is &quot;the dignity of proving we could do it for ourselves&quot;. He had just sent a few copies to his model farmers and received an excited phone call. &quot;I just want to thank you, thank you for putting my name, Charles Kahitson, all over the world,&quot; the voice said. &quot;But I didn&apos;t do it,&quot; Rugasira says to me. &quot;Charles grasped the opportunity to do that for himself.&quot; Andrew Rugasira is speaking at the Bristol Festival of Ideas, 18 February, 6.15pm"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/17/free-market-fundamentalists-think-2013-best", "sentences": ["Look at the so-called Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, or at Poland, South Korea, Singapore, Peru, even many sub-Saharan African states \u2013 they are all progressing."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-17T21:30:01Z", "title": "Why the free market fundamentalists think 2013 will be the best year ever | Slavoj \u017di\u017eek", "tags": ["Global recession", "Global economy", "Communism", "World news", "Economics", "Business"], "article": "The Christmas issue of the Spectator ran an editorial entitled &quot;Why 2012 was the best year ever&quot;. It argued against the perception that we live in &quot;a dangerous, cruel world where things are bad and getting worse&quot;. Here is the opening paragraph: &quot;It may not feel like it, but 2012 has been the greatest year in the history of the world. That sounds like an extravagant claim, but it is borne out by evidence. Never has there been less hunger, less disease or more prosperity. The west remains in the economic doldrums, but most developing countries are charging ahead, and people are being lifted out of poverty at the fastest rate ever recorded. The death toll inflicted by war and natural disasters is also mercifully low. We are living in a golden age.&quot; The same idea has been developed systematically in a number of bestsellers, from Matt Ridley&apos;s Rational Optimist to Steven Pinker&apos;s The Better Angels of Our Nature. There is also a more down-to-earth version that one often hears in the media, especially those of non-European countries: crisis, what crisis? Look at the so-called Bric countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, or at Poland, South Korea, Singapore, Peru, even many sub-Saharan African states \u2013 they are all progressing. The losers are western Europe and, up to a point, the US, so we are not dealing with a global crisis, but simply with the shift of progress away from the west. Is a potent symbol of this shift not the fact that, recently, many people from Portugal, a country in deep crisis, are returning to Mozambique and Angola, ex-colonies of Portugal, but this time as economic immigrants, not as colonisers? Even with regard to human rights: is the situation in China and Russia now not better than it was 50 years ago? Describing the ongoing crisis as a global phenomenon, the story goes, is a typical Eurocentrist view coming from leftists who usually pride themselves on their anti-Eurocentrism. Our &quot;global crisis&quot; is in fact a mere local blip in a larger story of overall progress. But we should restrain our joy. The question to be raised is: if Europe alone is in gradual decay, what is replacing its hegemony? The answer is: &quot;capitalism with Asian values&quot; \u2013 which, of course, has nothing to do with Asian people and everything to do with the clear and present tendency of contemporary capitalism to limit or even suspend democracy. This tendency in no way contradicts the much-celebrated progress of humanity \u2013 it is its immanent feature. All radical thinkers, from Marx to intelligent conservatives, were obsessed by the question: what is the price of progress? Marx was fascinated by capitalism, by the unheard-of productivity it unleashed; but he insisted this success engenders antagonisms. We should do the same today: keep in view the dark underside of global capitalism that is fomenting revolts. People rebel not when things are really bad, but when their expectations are disappointed. The French revolution occurred only once the king and the nobles were losing their hold on power; the 1956 anti-communist revolt in Hungary exploded after Imre Nagy had already been a prime minister for two years, after (relatively) free debates among intellectuals; people rebelled in Egypt in 2011 because there was some economic progress under Mubarak, giving rise to a class of educated young people who participated in the universal digital culture. And this is why the Chinese Communists are right to panic: because, on average, people are now living better than 40 years ago \u2013 and the social antagonisms (between the newly rich and the rest) are exploding, and expectations are much higher. That&apos;s the problem with development and progress: they are always uneven, they give birth to new instabilities and antagonisms, they generate new expectations that cannot be met. In Egypt just prior to the Arab spring, the majority lived a little better than before, but the standards by which they measured their (dis)satisfaction were much higher. In order not to miss this link between progress and instability, one should always focus on how what first appears as an incomplete realisation of a social project signals its immanent limitation. There is a story (apocryphal, maybe) about the left-Keynesian economist John Galbraith: before a trip to the USSR in the late 1950s, he wrote to his anti-communist friend Sidney Hook: &quot;Don&apos;t worry, I will not be seduced by the Soviets and return home claiming they have socialism!&quot; Hook answered him promptly: &quot;But that&apos;s what worries me \u2013 that you will return claiming USSR is not socialist!&quot; What Hook feared was the naive defence of the purity of the concept: if things go wrong with building a socialist society, this does not invalidate the idea itself, it simply means we didn&apos;t implement it properly. Do we not detect the same naivety in today&apos;s market fundamentalists? When, during a recent TV debate in France, the French philosopher and economist Guy Sorman claimed democracy and capitalism necessarily go together, I couldn&apos;t resist asking him the obvious question: &quot;But what about China?&quot; He snapped back: &quot;In China there is no capitalism!&quot; For the fanatically pro-capitalist Sorman, if a country is non-democratic, it is not truly capitalist, in exactly the same way that for a democratic communist, Stalinism was simply not an authentic form of communism. This is how today&apos;s apologists for the market, in an unheard-of ideological kidnapping, explain the crisis of 2008: it was not the failure of the free market that caused it, but the excessive state regulation; the fact that our market economy was not a true one, but was instead in the clutches of the welfare state. When we dismiss the failures of market capitalism as accidental mishaps, we end up in a naive &quot;progress-ism&quot; that sees the solution as a more &quot;authentic&quot; and pure application of a notion, and thus tries to put out the fire by pouring oil on it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/feb/18/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["The mysterious death of Shane Todd in Singapore &gt;&gt; FT.com  Shane had died a week before he was to return to the US."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-18T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Apple's suppliers mapped, Shane Todd's strange death, Wii U struggles and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Who supplies Apple?

The mysterious death of Shane Todd in Singapore &gt;&gt; FT.com  Shane had died a week before he was to return to the US. The police said he had drilled holes into his bathroom wall, bolted in a pulley, then slipped a black strap through the pulley and wrapped it around the toilet several times. He then tethered the strap to his neck and jumped from a chair. Shane, 6ft 1in and nearly 200lb, hanged himself from the bathroom door, the autopsy report said. So the Todds, along with two of Shane&apos;s younger brothers, John and Dylan, were unnerved by what they didn&apos;t see as they crossed the threshold. The front door was unlocked and there was no sign of an investigation \u2013 no crime-scene tape, no smudges from fingerprint searches. &quot;The first thing I did was make a beeline for the bathroom,&quot; Mrs Todd recalled. She wanted to see exactly how Shane had died \u2013 and she saw nothing that fitted the police description. The marble bathroom walls had no holes in them. Nor were there any bolts or screws. The toilet was not where the police had said.  A missing laptop, a backup hard drive, a potentially &quot;dual-use&quot; (civilian and military) project using gallium arsenide being worked on by China&apos;s Huawei, instructions to employees at Todd&apos;s former company IME not to talk to anyone - and staff there thinking his death was not suicide.

Korean lawmaker who exposed Samsung corruption forced from office &gt;&gt; The Verge  A South Korean politician who sought to expose corruption within Samsung&apos;s ranks has lost his seat in parliament. The Supreme Court upheld that by publishing transcripts of wiretapped conversations online, Roh Hoe-chan broke communications laws; the conviction means he cannot remain a lawmaker, and he has received a suspended prison sentence. In explaining its decision, the court said &quot;Unlike distributing press releases to journalists, uploading messages on the Internet allows an easy access to anybody at any time.&quot; \u2026The conversations in question are part of what is known as the Samsung X-File, a trove of tapes illegally recorded by the government&apos;s intelligence service during the 1990s. The files include conversations between Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee and his brother in law, and reveal bribes allegedly paid by the conglomerate to prosecutors, politicians, and presidential candidates.

Their skepticism matched my own experience; in my years of reporting on Apple and speaking to many of its employees, I had never heard of such a practice. When I sought answers by interviewing current and former Apple engineers, I found that &quot;fake&quot; projects are certainly not a regular occurrence at Apple \u2014 and they quite probably do not exist at all.

The sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Singapore and China own a total of over 40%, with the rest held by Canadian pension fund CPDQ and private investment firm Alinda Capital Partners. Matthews warned that investors, who he said had spent \u00a311bn on Heathrow since 2003, would go elsewhere without returns. The airport paid a dividend of \u00a3240m last year, its first since the 2006 takeover. The airport has set out plans to raise charges by 40% in real terms over the next five years \u2013 a proposal attacked by airlines which have demanded significant cuts after steep rises in recent years, including a 12.7% rise last April that contributed to an extra \u00a3130m in levies. Around \u00a33bn is earmarked for investment in its infrastructure and services. Matthews said that there was &quot;a very good level of agreement&quot; with airlines over the vision for an improved Heathrow, and insisted the higher charges \u2013 which will spell higher fares \u2013 were necessary. &quot;The balancing item is how quickly we get there. The faster we invest, the faster the short-term increase in prices. We do have a good agreement over investment priorities \u2013 the balancing act is affordability with the rate of progress. &quot;Airlines put pressure quite rightly on every single line of their costs. We&apos;ve made that upfront investment which is then paid down through landing charges over decades. We have to make a fair return to debt and equity to sustain the investment in Heathrow.&quot; The sale of Stansted, for a higher than expected \u00a31.5bn, should complete within the next two weeks, he said, but would not impact on the equation. &quot;Stansted is an asset that the shareholders owned \u2013 and the price was a good price. But that&apos;s separate from Heathrow.&quot; The decision on charges lies with the regulator, the CAA, which will give an indication in April of where charges are likely to be set before its final ruling later this year. Heathrow&apos;s revenues rose 8% to \u00a32.5bn while pre-tax losses were cut from \u00a3255.8m in 2011 to \u00a332.8m. Interest payments on Heathrow&apos;s debt wiped out operating profits of over \u00a3570m, meaning the airport paid \u00a38m in tax, after a \u00a364m tax credit received in 2011. Matthews said the tax figure categorically did not represent any kind of subsidy for Heathrow&apos;s investors. &quot;People pay tax when they make profit.&quot; Matthews said 2012 had been a good year for the airport: &quot;We had record passenger scores for assessing the quality of their journey in Heathrow \u2013 partly down to the Olympics.&quot; He said record passenger numbers of 70 million were likely to rise again slightly in 2013, although the airport was at capacity in terms of flights numbers. Additional A380 planes \u2013 which have around 100 seats more than 747s \u2013 would be the biggest driver of any increase. Matthews has recently been joined on the board of Heathrow by Akbar al-Baker, the outspoken chief executive of Qatar Airways, after the state&apos;s sovereign wealth fund took a 20% stake in the airport. Matthews said that al-Baker had not yet attended a board meeting, but was just one voice of many who supported the demand for greater hub capacity in the UK. Despite the capacity crunch, the Heathrow boss said he did not hold with calls made last week to bring forward the verdict of the Davies Commission to before the election. &quot;My view is that whatever decision is taken has to stick. The last two decisions have been promptly undone. That does no good whatsoever to the country. If in order to win broad enough political support that takes until 2015, then I&apos;d rather that than have a decision in 2013-14 which is undone at the next election, because that is just wasteful.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/18/britains-arms-trade-making-killing", "sentences": ["He has been to India before, in July 2010; Egypt and Kuwait in February 2011; Saudi Arabia in January 2012; Indonesia, Japan, Burma, Malaysia and Singapore in April 2012; Brazil in September 2012; and Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in November 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-18T19:00:05Z", "title": "Is Britain's arms trade making a killing?", "tags": ["Arms trade", "David Cameron", "Politics", "India", "World news", "Ministry of Defence", "UK news", "Manufacturing sector", "Weapons technology"], "article": "In the town centre of Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, between McDonald&apos;s and Carphone Warehouse, there is an unusual statue. Four firm-jawed figures in factory clothes stand back-to-back. One wears a flat cap, one wields a sledgehammer, one has a welder&apos;s visor. All of them are in purposeful poses, idealised workers cast in bronze. Around the statue base run the words &quot;labour&quot;, &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;progress&quot;. Its structure feels like something from the Soviet Union in the 30s. But the statue is British and only eight years old. Its subject and design, slightly startling in a country that stopped celebrating most factory workers decades ago, is explained by a small plaque. Part of the statue was &quot;donated by BAE Systems Submarines&quot;. Barrow is a defence industry town. It builds Britain&apos;s nuclear submarines. And in defence the way of doing things \u2013 culturally, economically, politically \u2013 is different from other British industries. In defence, manufacturing jobs still have prestige, long-term prospects and political leverage. Unions are strong, but work closely with management. Apprenticeships are sought-after and numerous. Political support for the business comes from across the ideological spectrum: when the European Fighter Aircraft collaboration between Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy, now known as the Typhoon, was threatened with cancellation in the 90s, even the Socialist Workers party protested (&quot;No Closures. No job losses. Stuff the Tories.&quot;) This week, David Cameron&apos;s much-hyped trade visit to India is promoting the Typhoon as one of its key objectives. Robin Cook, the late Labour minister, a rare defence industry critic in Westminster, wrote in his 2004 diaries that the then chairman of BAE, Dick Evans, seemed to have &quot;the key to the garden door of No 10&quot;. Roger Johnston, a defence analyst at Edison Investment Research, says: &quot;As an industry, it is reasonably unique in how it&apos;s viewed within government.&quot; In this business, in defiance of the past three decades&apos; free-market orthodoxies, the state is pivotal. Accompanying Cameron in India are representatives of a dozen British or partly British-based companies \u2013 the industry is clever at blurring such definitions \u2013 with defence interests: Rolls-Royce, Serco, BAE, EADS, Thales, Atkins, Cobham, JCB, Strongfield Technologies, MBDA, Ultra Electronics. The British state is also the industry&apos;s biggest customer, with our armed forces accounting for four-fifths of its annual sales; the provider of an &quot;export support team&quot;, including &quot;serving British army personnel&quot;; the provider of export insurance, for a fee, in case foreign customers fail to pay for products. Above all, the state is the provider of the wars that act as the industry&apos;s best showcase. &quot;The Typhoon fighter jet performed outstandingly in Libya,&quot; said Cameron in December, before an official visit to the Middle East. &quot;So it&apos;s no surprise that Oman want to add this aircraft to their fleet.&quot; On landing in the wealthy Gulf state, he strode quickly from his prime ministerial plane, in front of the TV cameras, to where a pair of dart-like Typhoons had been specially parked in the perfect, sales-catalogue sunshine, barely a hundred yards away. He climbed a set of steps to the open cockpit of one\u00a0of the fighters, and held a stagey conversation with its pilot. That day, it was confirmed that Oman had bought a\u00a0dozen of the aircraft. &quot;Boosting exports is vital for economic growth, and that&apos;s why I&apos;m doing all I can to promote British business \u2026 so [it] can thrive in the global race,&quot; said Cameron on the eve of his Oman trip. &quot;Every country in the world has a right to self-defence, and I&apos;m determined to put Britain&apos;s first-class defence industry at the forefront of this market, supporting 300,000 jobs across the country.&quot; Despite leading an overcommitted, often embattled government, he has frequently found time for foreign visits with a defence exports element. He has been to India before, in July 2010; Egypt and Kuwait in February 2011; Saudi Arabia in January 2012; Indonesia, Japan, Burma, Malaysia and Singapore in April 2012; Brazil in September 2012; and Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in November 2012. Throughout, his salesmanship and justifying rhetoric have been strikingly unashamed. &quot;The PM has done a fantastic job,&quot; says Howard Wheeldon, director of policy for ADS, a defence trade body. &quot;He has picked up the value of defence to the national economy. Other PMs haven&apos;t, necessarily. Mrs T was very supportive of defence exports \u2026 Brown wasn&apos;t, but Blair was \u2026&quot; Kaye Stearman, of the British activist group Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says: &quot;We&apos;re quite gobsmacked. For decades, governments have promoted arms sales, but there was always some degree of embarrassment \u2026 The\u00a0coalition are much more blatant \u2013 quite shameless.&quot; Last March Peter Luff, the minister for defence equipment \u2013 the position itself is telling \u2013 said in a speech in London: &quot;The individual UK armed forces are in themselves a brand \u2026 If they are using a particular piece of kit, then that&apos;s the kind of endorsement a lot of companies are very keen indeed to have.&quot; In 2011, the then defence secretary Liam Fox said in a speech at Defence and Security Equipment International, a huge biennial trade fair held at the ExCel Centre in east London: &quot;Defence and security exports play a key role in promoting our foreign policy objectives: building relationships \u2026 and spreading values.&quot; This April, a Royal Navy frigate is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli in Libya, reportedly with British companies exhibiting on board for a Whitehall-backed &quot;defence and security industry day&quot;. Even government policy on the London Olympics has produced a pay-off for the defence business. The brand of missiles controversially deployed around the Olympic site, Starstreak, made by Thales in Belfast, was sold to\u00a0Thailand four months later. John Warehand of Thales says the London deployment was a factor in the sale, and is still contributing to &quot;interest&quot; in\u00a0the missiles &quot;from countries in the Middle East and Asia&quot;.

Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA Archive/Press Association Ima    With the government desperate for economic growth, and seemingly just as quick as its recent predecessors to involve Britain in overseas conflicts, the defence industry&apos;s position is in some ways stronger than ever. Last month, Cameron suggested that if he was re-elected in 2015 British military spending would be exempt from the seemingly endless austerity planned for every other branch of government. But how important is the defence industry to Britain really? The assertion that it supports &quot;300,000 jobs&quot;, repeated like a mantra in recent years by Cameron, trade unions with defence members and the industry itself, is less conclusive than it appears. It is 1% of the UK workforce. According to the government-run UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), almost twice as many Britons work in food and drink manufacturing. And according to Ian Prichard of CAAT, the 300,000 figure is an exaggeration: &quot;It includes all the ancillary services connected with defence, such as the people looking after the [ministry of] defence estates. The actual defence industry workforce is, maximum, 215,000, and could well be 30,000 or 40,000 less.&quot; In 2003, Tony Blair told a prime ministerial press conference: &quot;There are roughly 100,000 jobs in this country that depend on defence or associated industries.&quot; The figure of 300,000, says CAAT, is also based on six-year-old government statistics. Conveniently for the industry, an official tally is no longer kept, for the defence workforce has been shrinking for decades: from 750,000 in 1980 in the nervous final phase of the cold war, according to the Defence Manufacturers Association, to 475,000 in 1989 as the Berlin Wall came down, to 350,000 in 1997 when Blair came to power. Despite Cameron&apos;s efforts, Johnston says the workforce will &quot;probably continue to trend down&quot;. The industry remains important by\u00a0global standards. After the US, the world&apos;s biggest defence exporter in 2011, with a 35% market share, Britain came second, with a 15% share, narrowly ahead of Russia and France, according to UKTI. There are only a few other businesses \u2013 such as pharmaceuticals and pop music \u2013 where Britain is still so internationally prominent. Yet like other defence statistics, this ranking should be treated with caution. The value of military exports, with their complex, often politicised, sometimes deliberately slow and secretive payment and delivery schedules, is notoriously difficult to measure. &quot;Our own government&apos;s figures are not very transparent in terms of what they&apos;re counting,&quot; says Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. &quot;They show a much higher level of export sales than other sources do. The American Congressional estimates of our defence exports are much less.&quot; But a few things about the industry can be said with certainty. Air warfare has for at least a decade been by far its most important overseas market. And the keenest foreign buyers of British military products have for at least as long been Middle Eastern countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, and the US.

Photograph: Rex Features    Our defence business used to be broader-based. Barrow is a remote peninsula town that was created in a few decades by Victorian industrialists. Starting in the 1880s, naval shipyards and arms factories were established on its flat, watery western extremities. As well as pioneering military submarines, they produced guns and torpedos, warships and airships, depth charges and aircraft carriers. Barrow products were sold to Turkey, Chile, Israel, Iran, Portugal and Japan, and to Britain&apos;s own expanding armed forces. During the first world war, the dockyard workforce hit a peak of 30,000, and whole Barrow suburbs were built to house it. &quot;When I started in the yard in 1960, everything was done there,&quot; says Terry Waiting, a former leader of Barrow council who still works in the town for BAE \u2013 Barrow&apos;s politics and dominant industry have long been intimately intertwined. &quot;We had our own foundries and engineering department.&quot; At lunchtime, bicycling workers would pour out of the yard and into Barrow&apos;s many pubs: &quot;You used to have three pints, pie and peas, and go straight back to work.&quot; In the 60s, the British defence industry was still benefitting from the fact that two potential rivals, Germany and Japan, were, as the second world war&apos;s defeated aggressors, unable to act as major military exporters. Meanwhile, the cold war was underway, Britain still had close ties to its former empire and the booming global oil trade was making many Middle Eastern countries rich but militarily anxious. Overseas markets for our defence products were plentiful. In 1966, with the British economy struggling, Harold Wilson&apos;s Labour government set up the Defence Export Services Organisation (Deso). Part of the Ministry of Defence, but employing arms company executives as well as civil servants, Deso quickly learned to chase export orders without too many scruples. &quot;Bribery has always played a role in the sale of weapons,&quot; Denis Healey, Wilson&apos;s defence secretary when Deso was established, told this newspaper in 2007. &quot;In the Middle East, people couldn&apos;t buy weapons unless you bribed them to do so, and that was particularly true in Saudi Arabia.&quot; During the 70s and 80s, British companies, first as nationalised then as\u00a0privatised concerns, sometimes sold\u00a0weapons to both sides in potential conflicts. A decade before the Falklands war, despite deteriorating Anglo-Argentinian relations, Barrow built identical destroyers for the two countries. But defence employees in\u00a0the town, like defence employees generally, have always been good at justifying what they do, both to themselves and others. &quot;I was in CND throughout the 60s and 70s,&quot; says Waiting. &quot;I&apos;ve still got a lot of time for the ideals of CND. In an ideal world, perhaps we might make big, beautiful liners in Barrow like we also did when I started. But nowadays, really, what else can you do in Barrow apart from build submarines? And they&apos;re good jobs.&quot; Azza Samms is the union convenor for the submarine plant&apos;s manual workers. He started in the Barrow shipyard in 1975, following after his father and grandfather, a common local pattern. He says: &quot;Everybody in Britain wants to be safe in their bed at night, but they don&apos;t want to build the submarines. And we build the submarines, not the [nuclear] missiles.&quot; The plant looms over the town, a single vast building, corrugated and pale, like a cross between a grain silo and a medieval cathedral. Two thousand people work inside the near-windowless, 10-storey walls of Devonshire Dock Hall; and more than 3,000 more in satellite submarine-building facilities across western Barrow. As the defence industry always does, the submarine yard alternates between publicity-seeking \u2013 crowds of locals are invited for submarine launches \u2013 and high security \u2013 &quot;We have Americans working here on the missile sections, but they have to be accompanied at all times,&quot; says Samms. Margaret Thatcher opened the hall in\u00a01986. Samms, a Labour supporter, stayed away from the ceremony. In the 80s, his party had turned critical of the defence business: &quot;We are alarmed by the growth of the arms trade,&quot; said its 1983 general election manifesto. &quot;Labour will limit Britain&apos;s arms sales abroad.&quot; Under the leadership of Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, the party planned to reduce British manufacturing&apos;s dependency on defence by converting the factories involved to civilian use. At the 1983 election, the Labour candidate in Barrow, a safe seat, was Albert Booth, new to the area and an advocate of unilateral nuclear disarmament. He led a CND march through the town.

Labour did not win it back until 1992. Two years later, Blair became party leader and Labour began to shed its qualms about the defence business. By\u00a01996, the party&apos;s policy handbook stated that the industry was &quot;of vital importance to the nation&apos;s economic performance&quot;. Labour figures who still worried about the ethics of the arms trade, such as Cook, won a concession from their party that British defence products would not be granted the necessary government export licences if, as Cook declared on becoming foreign secretary in 1997, &quot;there is a clearly identifiable risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression&quot;. But this assurance was quickly undermined by the Blair government&apos;s decision to sell military jets, water cannon and armoured cars to authoritarian Indonesia. As prime minister, like Cameron, Blair travelled widely to lobby for defence sales, to India, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. In 2006, he pressured the Serious Fraud Office into dropping an investigation into alleged bribes paid by BAE to secure Saudi orders. Yet Blair&apos;s arms industry advocacy was less public, and perhaps a little less desperate-seeming, than Cameron&apos;s. The wider British economy was booming, and in the treasury under the chancellor Gordon Brown there were many who felt that the defence industry was unnecessarily feather-bedded. &quot;Officials said to me: &apos;There isn&apos;t a good case for subsidising the arms industry,&apos;&quot; says Stephen Timms, then a treasury minister. Anti-arms trade campaigners such as CAAT \u2013 &quot;thoughtful, sensible&quot; people, says Timms \u2013 told him the same thing. In 2007, the ethical and free-market arguments against the defence industry came together, and its unique Whitehall helper, Deso, was shut down. The industry vented its fury via its many friends in the rightwing press. But the closure of Deso was arguably a last victory for the industry&apos;s opponents. A year later, the organisation was revived as the Defence &amp; Security Organisation (DSO), a remarkably similar body, no longer based inside the Ministry of Defence but still part of government. Timms says a little world-wearily: &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a possibility of this Deso sort of activity wholly disappearing.&quot; Even Ian Prichard of CAAT admits that currently, &quot;It&apos;s hard to see a mechanism&quot; for reducing the industry&apos;s power behind the scenes. The real threats to the business may be less ideological. Britain remains the fourth-biggest military spender in the world, but the very scale of that spending \u2013 currently \u00a334bn a year \u2013 makes it a\u00a0tempting target for Whitehall economisers. Since the coalition&apos;s austerity programme began in 2010, &quot;defence cuts really have bitten hard,&quot; says Wheeldon. Thousands of defence workers have been laid off. Tellingly, Cameron&apos;s commitment last month that the cuts would cease in 2015 was quickly softened into something more ambiguous by other government figures. And if Britain is becoming a less certain market for the industry, then so are some of its foreign ones. Defence budgets are under pressure across the west. Cameron&apos;s arms-related trips to Asia, South America and the Middle East are partly a tacit acknowledgement that the industry will increasingly have to look to non-western markets \u2013 which are already busy with defence companies from other traditionally strong military exporters such as France and the US, trying to escape their own domestic difficulties. Cameron&apos;s hopes of selling the Typhoon to India depend on the collapse of an Indian order for the French Rafale fighter aircraft. Yesterday, he also had to defend an Anglo-Italian helicopter maker, AgustaWestland, against allegations that its Italian parent company, Finmeccanica, had used bribery to win a\u00a0recent Indian order for the British-made\u00a0helicopters. &quot;Exporting is not an easy game \u2013 never was,&quot; says Wheeldon. Nowadays, says Chalmers, &quot;there is a market saturation issue.&quot; Meanwhile, for reasons of strategy, national pride and economic development, more countries are aiming to be, like Britain, as self-sufficient in defence manufacturing as possible. Foreigners bearing defence goods are received with less gratitude and credulity than they once were. The defence business can be adaptable. It survived the end of two world wars and the cold war. British firms are now diversifying into highly profitable service contracts \u2013 offering export customers training in how to use British products, and British staff to maintain them; and &quot;security&quot; \u2013 alarm systems, surveillance systems, forensic equipment and anti-hacker protection. &quot;There&apos;s more being spent on intelligence, reconnaissance and electronic gizmos,&quot; says Chalmers, &quot;and less on big platforms&quot; \u2013 the industry euphemism for machines that\u00a0kill people. In Barrow, they no longer build aircraft carriers, or destroyers, or surface warships. The manufacture of guns and munitions is almost gone too. The local ironworks closed in the 60s, the steelworks in the 80s. What remains is the submarines, and the alternating local pride, confidence and anxiety around them. Currently, Barrow is making the Astute class of conventionally-armed nuclear submarines. The work will last until the &quot;early 2020s&quot;, says BAE. If the next government approves a new generation of submarines to carry nuclear missiles \u2013 in a typical instance of how defence policy often outflanks democracy, the decision has been postponed until after the general election \u2013 then the beehive of Devonshire Dock Hall will be busy with that &quot;from 2016 to the 2040s&quot;, says Samms. Few 21st-century British employees have that sort of security. And yet, people in Barrow worry. &quot;This town would die without the shipyard,&quot; he says. Unlike in the past, it now does almost no export work. Even with the yard, Barrow is the 32nd most deprived borough in the country. Hard to get to, its once-handsome streets now a little empty and tatty, for\u00a0all its military history and gothic atmosphere it is unlikely ever to draw tourists like the Lake District a dozen miles north. And the north-west of England is ominously full of towns from which economic life has moved on. The current Barrow MP is John Woodcock, a well-connected young Labour figure and defence hawk. He has a not-impregnable majority of 5,208. He says of the local submarine business \u2013 but he could equally be talking about the defence industry as a whole \u2013 &quot;This is a sort of shark. It&apos;s got to keep going forward.&quot; Perhaps not a\u00a0metaphor for pacifists to dwell on."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/feb/19/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["Girl blackmails boy &gt;&gt; Naked Security  Singapore&apos;s Police Force has warned of femme fatales befriending potential victims on sites such as Facebook and Tagged.com.&lt;p?"], "publicationDate": "2013-02-19T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Google unPlayful, 19 degrees of web separation, iWatch v Glass and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Google Glass", "Wearable technology", "Tesla"], "article": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google asks journalists to tone down story of &quot;massive&quot; Google Play security flaw &gt;&gt; Apple Insider  After publishing the story [that Google Play accounts pass on emails and location details of buyers of apps to the app owners], News.com.au reported that &quot;this story was amended at the request of Google.

We&apos;ve heard from sources that Google these days is less keen on emphasizing the Android brand \u2014 witness the Android Market getting rebranded almost a year ago (after the last MWC) as Google Play. Pulling away from having a strong a presence may fold into that. &quot;Nexus and Galaxy are brands; Android is not,&quot; is how the thinking goes here. It&apos;s a far cry from years past, when Google had a dedicated site to its efforts at the conference, and gave out its popular array of Android pins to fans and those hoping for a neat profit someday on eBay (even making a video about them). You could also argue that part of the reason why Google does not need to make as big of a push at MWC is because it has already achieved market dominance\u2026 In this sense, absence is power, not weakness.   Any two pages on the web are connected by 19 clicks or less &gt;&gt; Surprising Science  No one knows for sure how many individual pages are on the web, but right now, it&apos;s estimated that there are more than 14 billion. Recently, though, Hungarian physicist Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si discovered something surprising about this massive number: Like actors in Hollywood connected by Kevin Bacon, from every single one of these pages you can navigate to any other in 19 clicks or less. Barab\u00e1si&apos;s findings, published yesterday in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, involved a simulated model of the web that he created to better understand its structure. He discovered that of the roughly 1 trillion web documents in existence \u2014 the aforementioned 14 billion-plus pages, along with every image, video or other file hosted on every single one of them \u2014 the vast majority are poorly connected, linked to perhaps just a few other pages or documents. Distributed across the entire web, though, are a minority of pages\u2014search engines, indexes and aggregators\u2014that are very highly connected and can be used to move from area of the web to another.

It also requires interruption \u2013 what I call the &quot;intrusive business model&quot;. I think the most potentially intractable problem that Google faces in its quest to create connected, personal hardware devices, one that Apple is liberated from, is the fundamentally intrusive nature of its business model. We may all &quot;search&quot; for information, but that does not necessarily mean we want to be bombarded with ads. Ads are already everywhere, it seems; within our (free) apps and games, on Google maps, scattered across web pages, inside YouTube videos, and more and more on the Google search page. Where does this end? I don&apos;t want my Google Glasses, for example, to pop up ads right in my eye, nor have a commercial play some catchy jingle into the sensor I keep in my ear. I don&apos;t want my iWatch clone, for example, to vibrate every time it thinks I might be interested in some deal or datapoint \u2013 when in fact, it&apos;s really because the sender \u2013 the intruder \u2013 is making money off stealing my attention. As computing becomes increasingly more personal, there is a very real chance that Google&apos;s business model becomes increasingly more intrusive.  Dislike of advertising is puzzling to Americans, but much closer to the surface in the UK and other European countries. Then again, in Asia advertising is rarely less than intrusive. Will there be regional differences in the success of different business models? Boy meets girl. Girl strips on webcam. Tells boy to do the same. Girl blackmails boy &gt;&gt; Naked Security  Singapore&apos;s Police Force has warned of femme fatales befriending potential victims on sites such as Facebook and Tagged.com.&lt;p? The women enter steamy webcam conversations with their prey, where they strip and encourage their male victim to do the same. What the man doesn&apos;t realise, as he feverishly rips his clothes off and agrees to engage in various sexual acts in front of the camera, is that his female love interest is secretly recording everything that&apos;s going on. The male victim is then blackmailed for money by the woman who threatens to circulate the compromising photographs and videos. Ouch! That must put a dampener on the evening.

Results from the first eight patients to enrol in a clinical trial of the retinal implants show that five found the chips improved their eyesight enough to be useful in everyday life. All those involved \u2013 men and women aged 35 to 62 \u2013 had lost their sight to retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary disease that destroys the light-sensitive cells in the eye. The chip stands in for the defunct cells by detecting light rays and converting them into electrical pulses, which are sent along the optic nerve to the brain. Each patient spent up to 10 hours in surgery to have the 3mm by 3mm chip implanted in one eye. The chip is studded with 1,500 light-sensitive elements that pick up light falling on the macula, the most light-sensitive part of the retina (if you&apos;re reading on a mobile device, click here to see a video of the retinal implant).     X-ray of a patient fitted with the retinal implant. A dial on the outside of the head controls brightness levels. Photograph: Robert MacLaren/Oxford Eye Hospital    The chip does not restore vision fully. Instead, patients see light and dark patches in a small part of their visual field, as if they had black-and-white tunnel vision. Though limited, some could read signs on doors, tell the time on analogue clocks and distinguish white wine from red, for example. One patient made out a white goose swimming on water, another saw a sunflower stem. Writing in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the team led by Eberhart Zrenner at the University Eye Hospital in T\u00fcbingen, Germany, describe patients&apos; experiences and how they fared in a series of vision tests three to nine months after the implants were fitted. Three patients could immediately read letters, such as T, V, L and O. In another test, five participants could track bright dots as they moved across a computer screen. The chip is powered wirelessly from a battery the patient wears in their pocket, so none of the equipment is clearly visible. A dial worn behind the ear allows the patient to adjust the brightness for different lighting conditions. The trial follows a pilot study of the implants that impressed doctors in 2010. Though only patients from the German trial are reported in the latest paper, more people have since been fitted with the implants in Oxford, London, Hong Kong and Singapore. Robert MacLaren, a consultant retinal surgeon involved in the trial at Oxford Eye Hospital, said: &quot;We&apos;ve had success with the implants so far, there is no doubt about that. We&apos;ve had completely blind patients who were able to see things again, but the technology is still early, we need to develop it further.&quot; Tim Reddish, chairman of the British Paralympic Association, was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa at the age of 31, and had lost all useful sight seven years later. Now 55, he agreed to take part in the trial to help the scientists perfect the device, and had one fitted by MacLaren in October 2012. &quot;In the lab tests, when there are objects on a table, and the lighting is bright, I can tell you how many objects there are, and most of the time I can read the clock they have,&quot; Reddish told the Guardian. But he added that the implant was not much help in his everyday life. &quot;I have adapted very well to losing my sight, and the implant doesn&apos;t give me much assistance at the moment. I do see some light, but it&apos;s not enough to make out, for example, the end of a row of buildings.&quot; Reddish and other patients will be monitored for a year in the hope that the device helps to improve their vision. &quot;I don&apos;t know what will happen at the end of the trial. Whether we get to use and abuse it, or get Mark II,&quot; said Reddish. &quot;But I&apos;m not worried about that. I decided to take part in the hope that it could help one of my relatives in the future, and other kids out there.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/feb/19/participatory-development-crowdsourcing-debate", "sentences": ["Jenny Hodgson, executive director, The Global Fund for Community Foundations, Johannesburg, South Africa @globalfundcf Jenny has been working in the field of philanthropy and development since 1992 in Uganda, Russia, Kenya, Singapore and Thailand."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-20T16:22:00Z", "title": "Beneficiaries-led development: can assistance be crowdsourced?", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Live Q&As", "Global development"], "article": "The development agenda is being discussed more widely than ever. With consultation platforms such as the Overseas Development Institute&apos;s My World survey and the post-2015.org website, there&apos;s no shortage of space for debate. But is enough being done to facilitate and encourage participation from those at the receiving end of international aid? The use of participatory development methods (PDMs) is not a new concept. Having been pioneered by organisations such as the USAid-funded African Development Foundation, PDMs have been used in various ways for decades. What is new, however, is the role of technology in crowdsourcing participation in development. An example is the recent Map Kibera citizen-mapping project run with media consultancy group GroundTruth, which has brought an online interactive community to the Kenyan town of Kibera. Successful crowdsourcing depends on the availability, acceptance and use of crowdsourcing technologies, as highlighted in a recent paper by economist Maja Bott and impact consultant Gregor Young. The authors also emphasise the importance of a well-defined set of objectives, that are sensitive to the local context, so that the crowd can consider it to be valuable and well-intentioned. Yet critics suggest many development actors do not sufficiently seek what academics call &apos;the wisdom of the crowds&apos;. Far from engaging, some donors and agencies are accused of having rigid and narrow project designs that still consider their &apos;beneficiaries&apos; as a homogenous group, without considering cultural diversity. Development platform Globalhood&apos;s recent report on development projects that didn&apos;t work calls this the &apos;fallacy of under-differentiation&apos;. So, how can agencies, governments and donors better use the tools available to adopt a community-centered approach to development? Controversially perhaps, is beneficiaries-led development even possible and if so, what reforms are needed in the sector to ensure it works?

We asked for your input, with many Italian commenters coming forward with other problems Italy&apos;s government should tackle as well as thoughts on the issues our correspondent put forward. Here is a round up of some of the responses, or add yours to the comment thread here. Justice system: rightwinggit said:  I would say the justice system. Not because the other problems aren&apos;t as serious, if not more so, but because it is something the government could change swiftly without having to spend too much money.Many of the other problems cannot easily be solved because of the justice system.Deal with the justice system and delaing with organised crime, bureaucratic inertia, and the political system becomes easier. The slow justice system was deliberately exploited by Berlusconi to avoid facing criminal charges and prolong his periods in office for example.  goto100 responded:  It&apos;s odd you highlight the judicial system for reform. For all its faults, it has proven the only one (so far) capable of going after and convicting officers of the state for collusion in kidnapping, rendition and torture. A CIA station chief was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 7 years. The head and deputy head of Italy&apos;s foreign intelligence agency have received 9 and 7 year sentences for their role. They are currently appealing. I am aware of the great problems with Italy&apos;s legal system. I am also aware that the word &quot;reform&quot; is often code for &quot;neo-liberal take over&quot;. When an entire legal system is up for grabs, I get very, very angry when neo-libs are trying to stealth-storm the castle. Are you sure you are not regurgitating their self-serving demands in that call for reform? Are you sure what those people you quote really want is total impunity for themselves - and sod the rest of it?  coden:  @goto100 - You have certainly chosen an emblematic example of the justice mechanism at work: foreign subjects beyond Italy&apos;s control condemned, nationals given a conviction but there is no way any of them will see the inside of a prison, not because of &apos;Ragionne di Stato&apos;, but simply because a conviction followed by a rejection of the appeal is not considered, legally or &apos;culturally&apos;, to signify guilt, as it would be in comparable countries.So, Item 1, change the constitution to bring in one-stop justice (with appeal from prison, of course).Item 2, have direct election of candidates for public office.  caracaqui:  The tourism industry, which doubtless is an important part of Italy&apos;s economy, is a joke! never ever have I been treated so badly by people who I&apos;m giving money to as in Florence: you queue up for hours to get a ticket for the Ufizzi Gallery and then get kicked around and rudely told you can&apos;t visit certain rooms with no other explanation... won&apos;t be going back or recommending despite the wonderful artworks.  Bladeluca:  Short term memory. The Italian electorate is quick to forget the endless list of wrong-doings of its political class. The real issue lies in media and information. You cannot educate a country by showing semi-naked girls in day-time programs. Berlusconi&apos;s TV bulimia has condemned Italy to ignorance and shallowness. Political action is now branded as evil and the less people care and go on about their daily lives the happier everyone is. Also, whilst in the UK an MP can face jail for blagging a speeding ticket, there are currently 36 million euro unaccounted for each year just on politician&apos;s expenses. The sheer madness of that speaks a lot about the country.  Mindset: Alessandra75:  What is missing on this list is: Italian Mindset and the spreading of Berlusconi philosophy.In Italy there is a strong attitude towards corruption and small criminality. People still thinks it is fine not to pay taxes because taxes are too high. It is fine not to respect rules because rules are too strict.It is fine to corrupt, because this is the way things are obtained.It is cool to be sexist because women are objects.It is fine to behave without any respect of other people because &apos;this is what everyone is doing!&apos;.And this is what Berlusconi has represented for the last 19 years.He represents what lot of Italians would like to be, or how they would like to live: in total disrespect of civil rules and laws.The problem to solve is not Berlusconi, it&apos;s some Italian mindset and their attitude towards their country and society.And sadly this won&apos;t be solved by next government, but will (hopefully) take new generations and long time.  mirtilo:  @FlavioF - Im a Brit in Milan for quite a few years.. my son goes to scuola pubblica .. the education is a VERY different approach from that in the UK.. but I&apos;m not convinced it is worse.. Its boring, thats for sure, old fashioned and rote learing compared to the curiculum in Scotland.. Although everyone assures me it is the fortune of which teacher your children find themselves with (for five years of elementary school and beyond).. I agree with the mindset.. everyone pays for too many services in &quot;nero&quot; (payment in cash which will be undeclared) so even i end up doing so .. because well.. everyone just does. If my gyaenocologist or dentist in one of the best areas of Milano doesnt offer a fattura (fiscal bill) and therefore you know the cash you have just given him is not going to be taxed at all.. well its just too uncomfortable to ask for it.. Plus you would have to pay the extra 20% VAT on an already hugely expensive appointment. As a straniera, you end up &quot;fitting in&quot; and not making a fuss.. but it does leave a bitter and guily taste.. but no, i dont think its &quot;OK&quot; at all..  canuk1:  Been living in Italy for 15 years ..Yes, the 6 points you listed and detailed are very significant, however, any solution goes far beyond any policies or government. It will require a wholesale cultural and society change.The roots of the problems go back the end of WW2, when Italy was in very dire straits.A generation grew up looking to the mafia for help rather than the government, because the government was inept and the cupboards were bare. It was the mafia who siphoned off the international aid off docks and performed the &apos;redistribution&apos;. The politicians were on the receiving end of the benefits, and the government was powerless to stop this, even if it wanted to.Fast-forward to today, and you have the current 2nd and 3rd generations growing up with attitudes passed down from their war-time and post-war relatives. Every Italian I have met has no use for the government, in fact, the government is the enemy, and not the mafia that is preventing them from doing want they want to do, and that is getting ahead of their neighbour.Today, an Italian is not happy unless running a scam of some sort. Most of this involves avoiding taxes and circumventing the shed load of rules, regulations and laws in the country. Neighbours are fair game for grifting a few euros out of, as well as some family members, if the opportunity arises.Men like Silvio Berlusconi are not vilfied, in fact he is deeply admired for being a &apos;made man&apos;. Most Italian men aspire to be just like Berlusconi!So, how can any Italian government hope to introduce reforms in a society where generations have been essentially at war with it&apos;s own government, and where the political and industrial elite classes are some of the main beneficiaries of that war?A taxi driver in Geneva once said to me that in order for the EU to function better, each member state should swap governments for 6 months. For example, the German government does Italy, and Italian government does Germany for 6 months... What an intriguing concept ...  Amarantha Sophia:  I&apos;m an italian who lived in Cambridge for almost 5 years, and now I&apos;m back in Italy since only three months. I must admit it has been shocking to see italian society from the inside once again. I totally agree with all the points of the article. I would like just to add two considerations. The first: when I was in the UK I felt I had to defend &quot;Italians&quot; from constant mocking originating from Berlusconi&apos;s government. My main argument was that Berlusconi was not representing Italians correctly. I was wrong. Italian politics is corrupt and incapable of reform exactly because politicians correctly represents what italians are nowadays. So, the second consideration is: there is no chance to see any serious reform in Italy until there is some kind of &quot;sense of responsibility&quot; in the people. I mean, a sense that the action of each individual have a social dimension. Something similar to what Italians felt during the post-war reconstruction, when two years of german invasion left a strong sense of a common destiny.Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see this feeling in people. I just see a lot of conservatism. I just see people afraid to lose their little niche of privilege rather than people desiring something new, something really new.  Young people and unemployment: Lara_Tai  I think you should have given more space to young people issue. For many of them - and especially if they have good educational achievements, Italy doesn&apos;t really offer an opportunity of employment. Compared to the rest of European countries, we have the lowest tertiary education share among young but at the same time the highest unemployment rate among them. This contraddiction has lead in the past years to a reprise of emigration.If young people don&apos;t see a future in Italy, it is Italy in the whole to lose its own future. Last governements have done nothing for young, there aren&apos;t any social policies oriented to them (it is not a case if our young leave their parental home at the latest compared to the rest of Europe). Housing is unaffordable, the highest share of precarious work has to be found among them and especially for young women there is no really help in getting a satisfactory work/life balance. Italy is a country for old men and women (more than 60% of State resources are given to pensioneers).The worst is that this is not even an issue in this absurd national election&apos;s campain.  Londoner85:  I am in Italian and I have been living in London for the last 6 year. I agree with the article and the comments above, however I would have add young people / migration as a massive issue for Italy. I studied in one of Italy&apos;s &quot;top&quot; universities (whatever that means) and 90% of my cohort has emigrated to another country since graduation. Many of them have come to the UK, but also France, Germany, US, even China and Singapore. I think it is particularly worrying that so many young Italians are leaving the country. Even more worringly, it is the fact that many of them would not want to go back to Italy. I think there is a huge impact in economics terms because lots of highly skilled Italians just leave the country and more and more, they don&apos;t go back.  edcutz:  I&apos;m a British expat living in Milan, married to an Italian (Roman), with two kids and my own business. I love the country very deeply and can&apos;t imagine ever returning to live in the UK, however it&apos;s an incredibly frustrating place to live sometimes.For me, the biggest overriding problem is that of age. I don&apos;t see any opportunities for the young and talented, and considering that your most creative years are your 20&apos;S and 30&apos;s, this talent (of which there is an abundance in all sectors) is totally wasted, and more often than not end up abroad. This has to be the prime factor for why everything else in Italy stagnates - no innovation, no change, no progress. You have to wait till you&apos;re in your mid-40&apos;s before you get anywhere near a responsible job, and by that time your priorities have changed. This is most clearly represented in politics, which is wholly dominated by old men, who by the time they&apos;ve entered office and realise how comfortable everything is (MP&apos;s renumeration and benefits in Italy are eye-watering) they are suddenly, no longer interested in reform.This age problem in turn feeds into perhaps one of the saddest realities, that despite the legendary Italian strength of &quot;la famiglia&quot;, the country has the joint lowest birth-rate in the world. Unsurprising, given the lack of financial support or incentives to start a family. Italians in the end are incredibly pragmatic, and the low birth-rate very accurately reflects all of the current inhospitable social and economic conditions.I stick by the mantra that you get the government you deserve. But in the case of Italy, this is an incredibly bitter pill to swallow.  Alessandro76:  As an ex young graduate with experiences abroad, I can say that Italy is the only place where my will to work has been always frustrated. Basically there&apos;s no trust in youth. Employers are usually nor smart neither open minded enough to understand people&apos;s qualifications, and they look instead for servants. The cultural level of the whole country is going down and down, first brainwashed by Berlusconi&apos;s propaganda, now pushed by the urge to produce at all costs to meet the Troika requirements. Young qualified people has to pick up whatever job they can, usually humiliated in call centers, and always with short term contracts. Most of my friends are now living spread all over the Europe/World. I&apos;d like to live in Italy, but as I won&apos;t fight for the basic old right to work to live and not live to work, I will happily reach them asap.  FrancescaTM:  I would add the lack of meritocracy in the work place and resulting brain drain to the list.This is a serious issue for a country that is struggling to grow, especially because the people that are leaving are usually highly skilled and educated, which deprives the country of talents that could positively contribute to innovation, productivity and research.In my personal experience this is particularly evident in the academic/ research sector and in the professions. The lack of progress on merit and the fact that it is mostly demotivated people in their 60s at the end of their careers that still keep hold of the top professional ranks is pushing enthusiastic and capable individuals abroad.Of my personal circle of friends from university, those who left with the highest grades and the best degrees have nearly ALL left, which is saddening. The reason for this has always been lack of good opportunities and a work practice that doesn&apos;t reward quality, commitment and passion.  MattiaPascal:  I can only say that i studied a whole life, i obtained a second level degree, i also worked twice (naturally always gratis) as internship, and now i&apos;m unemployed.One of the most problems in Italy is the fable of &quot;meritocracy&quot; that for long time it has deceived us that a young graduate, son of a worker, would have the same employment opportunities of a son of a diplomat. I studied at one of the most important Univerity of Italy thanks to the efforts of my family, and there i saw with my eyes that one that they call &quot;meritocracy&quot;. I saw some of my colleagues (with less brilliant results) to apply the same corporate whom refused my application. I think that labor reform have to begin from University with the installation of a new monitoring system.  Rxxx:  What about job insecurity for young workers (young meaning under about 40yo)? The older generation are locked into contracts and very difficult to fire (I&apos;m not saying this is bad in itself) and the unions defend this lot and keep out the &quot;young&quot; folks on insecure temporary contracts. This is also a major factor in the low birth rate and women&apos;s poor employment rates (they find themselves pregnant, or even just get married, and suddenly they find there is no contract to renew). This is not a &quot;recession&quot; problem but has been going on for at least a decade.The law needs to protect temporary workers (implementing properly EU law would be a start) and create a system like in Iceland where if you are on a &quot;temporary&quot; contract with the same business for 2 years or more, you are automatically considered a permanent employee, entitled to the same job protections. (Yes, in theory, employers could just fire people after 23 months; in practice, they don&apos;t, bceaue they want to keep the good people they have trained. Unless they are pregnant.).The unions need to get it togehter and realise that unemployment, youth uinemployment and job insecurity is bad for ALL workers and stop playing into the divide and conquer trap.  The mafia jixiang:  I think that is should be made clearer in the article that the issue of the mafia pertains mainly to Southern Italy, rather than the whole country. Yes, the mafia does business all over Italy, and even in other countries when it comes to that, but still at the street level it is only present in the South. Shopkeepers are only asked to pay protection money in the South, and people are only afraid to denounce mafia activity in the South. Such things would be unthinkable anywhere in northern or central Italy. It is unfair to make it seem like the whole of Italy is infested with the mafia, and it adds to stereotypes.  thesweeneytodd adds:  To me, you actually left out the most shocking aspect of systemic Italian failure, the near total dominance of La Cosa Nostra in the waste management industry. True, you touched on the Mafia in the article, but their near total control of a virtually unregulated sector has left parts of Italy with near 3rd world levels of environmental destruction. There are vast tracts of southern Italy littered - literally - with illegal and highly toxic dumps. Any attempts by authorities to control, regulate or prosecute are usually met with extreme corruption or violence. I just watched a documentary on the subject and am still reeling from what I saw.  The Vatican silvia7:  I&apos;m Italian and moved to the UK in 2001. I think another huge problem is the Influence of the Vatican. The way Catholicism is taught in schools makes young people more likely to follow dogmas and to not question anything. This is why Italian people often accept their politicians&apos; doings without putting up much of a fight. From very early on we were taught to accept and not question. Attitudes here in the UK are so different, people are a lot more skeptical and love doing their own research.  Nepotism dhc1970 added:  I lived in Italy for two years which was more than enough although it is a beautiful country. This article is right about a lot but it doesn&apos;t really highlight the primary probem which is the endemic culture of nepotism. As this has been entrenched for so long and there are so many vested interests at stake the problem of Italy being a corrupt and uncompetitive country is unlikely to be solved.

At the request of 11 states, I proposed the first financial transaction tax (FTT) \u2013 often referred to as the Tobin or Robin Hood tax \u2013 to be implemented at regional level. The proposal had originally been tabled in September 2011 to cover all of the EU, but was opposed by some countries, including Britain. Now 11 member states \u2013 including Germany, Greece, France and Spain \u2013 have decided to move ahead as a smaller group. Why are these states so keen to press ahead? First, they are responding to the persistent demands of their citizens, who have long called for a harmonised FTT in Europe. The levy will ensure that the under-taxed financial sector finally makes a fair contribution to the public purse. Second, the tax offers substantial new revenues. Around \u20ac30-35bn (\u00a326-30bn) per year will be generated from this small tax of just 0.1% on bonds and shares and 0.01% on derivatives. This means new resources for growth-friendly investment, stabilising public finances or wider commitments such as development aid. Finally, it should help to deter the irresponsible financial trading that contributed to the crisis we are in today. It will favour steady financial activity over high-risk speculation and steer the financial sector towards the real economy. Since the tax will apply to any transactions with an established economic link to the 11 states, the only way to avoid it would be to give up all financial trading with those in the FTT-zone \u2013 a highly irrational response to a small tax, especially given the fact that the participating countries constitute two-thirds of the EU economy. In short, what I propose is fair, sensible and well-designed. Nonetheless, I am aware of the questions and concerns that have been voiced, especially in the UK. Many of these fears are a reaction to the scare-mongering of vested interest groups or a misunderstanding of how the tax will work. So let me address them head on. Will the tax be borne by ordinary citizens? We have taken every measure to ensure that it isn&apos;t. This is a tax on the financial sector, and 85% of liable transactions are purely between financial institutions. Day-to-day financial activities of citizens and businesses are outside its scope. Even if the financial sector passed on some costs to clients, the outcome would not be disproportionate. For example, anyone buying, \u20ac10,000 in shares should be able to afford a \u20ac10 tax on the transaction. Will the tax hamper growth in the EU? No. Our economic studies show that it will have no impact on jobs, and could even have a positive impact on growth if revenues are reinvested wisely. The tax rates proposed are very low, to prevent an increased cost of capital affecting the real economy, and the activities of central banks and public debt managers are exempt. Will the tax reach beyond its boundaries \u2013 into the UK? If there is an economic link to the FTT zone, it will apply, regardless of whether the other parties to the transaction are based in London, Singapore, Copenhagen or New York; there is no extra-territoriality to this. Taxing cross-border services is a well-established principle in taxation and fully in line with international law. For comparative examples, we need only look at how VAT and even UK stamp duty work. The FTT is on sound legal footing and totally proportionate in its scope. Will the regional FTT have any impact on the UK in the end? Certainly not a negative one. If anything, the UK will benefit from a less fragmented single market and a more stable financial sector, as a result of others applying the tax. In an ideal world, the UK would come on board, so that it, too, could reap the revenues. It has opted not to for now, as is its sovereign right. But the door is always open to join at any time. In the meanwhile, eleven member states march ahead as pioneers with a regional FTT, ready to prove that this fair and robust tax can and should be applied widely."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/feb/22/karin-svanborg-sjovall-welfare-sweden", "sentences": ["\u2022 The inaugural lecture in the Guardian Global Public Leaders Series was given by Peter Ong, head of the Singapore civil service, in November 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-22T10:09:38Z", "title": "Swedish lessons: public services should decentralise and embrace private provision", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network"], "article": "Swedish policy expert and author Karin Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall says many countries could take lessons from Sweden&apos;s uniquely organised system, particularly on the relationship between private and public provision of welfare services. In the second lecture of the Guardian Global Public Leaders series at the Guardian Public Leaders Summit, Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall cites citizens&apos; rising expectations as one of the biggest challenges for the modern welfare state. &quot;These days people place increasingly stringent demands on accessibility, quality and co-determination ... and all this at a lower cost.&quot; Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall says that to deal with this, policy-makers and public leaders should focus not only on the issue of how much people can receive for their taxes, but also what type of welfare people can expect to receive in the future. There are two lessons that she says countries with stretched welfare systems could take from Swedish system: First, to create a culture which is open to change and diversity, the author says governments must be prepared to decentralise welfare provision. &quot;Reduced central control leads to increased diversity and better individual adaptation,&quot; she says, although she acknowledges that sometimes there is a price to be paid. Second, stop viewing the private and the public sectors as antitheses. In Sweden, Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall says that opening up the welfare state to competition has created cost-awareness and increased citizen choice and involvement. She says this has been beneficial not just for those receiving public services, but also the staff who deliver them, because &quot;the gulfs that a public monopoly creates between employees and their bosses, and between a country&apos;s politicians and its citizens, seems to be numbing, stupefying and, above all, costly&quot;. However, the author adds that this process has not been without its challenges. She urges public leaders to remember that co-operation between public and private providers requires extremely well-defined division of roles and stresses the importance for civil servants of learning to be &quot;a good client&quot;. Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall concludes that although financial difficulty may force governments to reconsider the boundary between what the state provides and individual responsibility, economic crises &quot;tend to create a sense of curiosity and openness and a willingness to change&quot;, that could be a driver of welfare innovation. \u2022 The inaugural lecture in the Guardian Global Public Leaders Series was given by Peter Ong, head of the Singapore civil service, in November 2012.

Maybe everyone has this, or maybe it&apos;s a luxury we only have in the developed economies of the world. But I was there 20 years ago. I&apos;d been working for seven years for Unilever \u2013 a wonderful business education. But I was the son of a shopkeeper and somehow it was in my blood to start my own business one day. So in 1992, I teamed up with Dave Allan, a fellow Unilever marketer, and we formed a company with the glorious name of ?What If! Our dream was to help large organisations develop their innovation muscles. Today we are 300 strong and work with global companies such as Barclays, Pernod Ricard, Pfizer and Telefonica. But back to 1992. Dave and I really had nothing \u2013 no mortgages, no savings, no families. I think that&apos;s what enabled us to cook up such crazy schemes in the early years. The two of us would meet up in the Hope Working Men&apos;s Caf\u00e9 on the Holloway Road in North London and compile our to-do list for the day and then go our separate ways to tick them off. (I&apos;m still a compulsive list maker and tell my kids: &quot;If you&apos;re listless make a list!&quot;.) Through our Unilever network we knew a lot of people in consumer goods companies. A contact at Cadbury Schweppes asked us on a Friday to investigate ideas for the soft drinks market in Europe. So we jumped in Dave&apos;s old banger and spent the weekend driving around Europe collecting fizzy samples and swapping ideas. On the Monday we were able to knock our client&apos;s socks off with a terrific presentation. You don&apos;t do things like this if you think too hard or have too much to lose. &quot;What the heck, lets give it a go&quot; Over the years we developed a clear set of operating principles around innovation projects; work in bursts, always involve customers, make ideas real, pay attention to team behaviour and recruit the absolute best talent. Our client partners found this way of working really got results and in the mid 1990s several of them asked us to translate these principles into a training course. I remember that at the time we debated whether we were destroying our core business. This is the quintessential innovation debate \u2013 one that&apos;s incredibly hard for incumbent companies with healthy market positions to answer clearly. Fortunately, we didn&apos;t think too much and decided &quot;what the heck, let&apos;s give it a go.&quot; Today our innovation training business accounts for half our revenues and is hard at work with organisations as diverse as Google, the civil service and AstraZeneca. Understanding our limits as people has helped Dave and I make ?What If! the success it is today, but it was also one of the hardest things to accept. We recognised that we were good starters but not necessarily the best finishers. Lose the ego In the early 2000s we asked Sal Pajwani, who had been with us for years, to become the company CEO. He drove a period of rapid growth and just recently Sal, Dave and I asked Barrie Berg, who heads our US office, to lead the group. I truly believe that entrepreneurs have to lose the ego and do whatever it takes to grow the business and do what&apos;s right for customers. Things work best as a series of projects, and permanent roles just get in the way. Over the years, we&apos;ve worked hard to discover how employees can get the most out of each other and partner best with clients. In my view, it all comes down to how we behave together; how we build one anothers&apos; ideas, how we give each other feedback and even how we argue. To help us with this we talk a lot about five things: impact, audacity, love, passion and adventure. These words headline concepts that help us do our jobs better. For instance, audacity is all about the fact that innovators hate mediocrity. So it&apos;s important at work that we all drive for an unimaginably outstanding result. These values are the only real rules we have at work, they&apos;re surprisingly hard edged and we include our clients in them as well. Today, ?What If! has offices in London, Manchester, Shanghai, Singapore, New York and any minute now in Sao Paulo. We&apos;re busy translating our core products into digital offerings \u2013 an exciting project that&apos;s opening up new markets to us. Nothing will ever feel as entrepreneurial as the early days, but I&apos;d like to think that by driving the business through values, cutting out hierarchy and constantly focusing on how we can better partner with our clients, we will stay positive, audacious and valuable.

Moody&apos;s said the main reason was the evidence that Britain&apos;s economic growth would remain sluggish for a few years. The slower-than-expected recovery has made it hard for George Osborne to meet his own deficit reduction targets. A debilitating debt pile meant the UK was less able to deal with potential economic or financial shocks. On a more positive note, the agency said a combination of political will and underlying economic strengths would, in time, allow the government to reduce the debt burden. Why has the downgrade happened now? The timing was a surprise: most economists were expecting the rating agencies to wait for the budget on 21 March before showing their hand. But Moody&apos;s decided to move because of the UK&apos;s &quot;high and rising debt burden&quot;, as made clear by the public finances data published last week. Are the other agencies likely to follow? Moody&apos;s has placed the UK&apos;s rating on a &quot;stable footing&quot; but Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s have it under review for a potential downgrade. Fitch is expected to jump first: economists predict a UK downgrade within two weeks of the budget. Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s might wait longer, being the last to put the rating under review last December. Some economists think it may not act until next year. What will it mean for the budget? The chancellor said the downgrade had redoubled his resolve to deliver his recovery plan, but the news will add to tensions in the coalition . The Liberal Democrats have so far remained publicly united behind Osborne, but some have spoken privately about concerns that Plan A is not working. Growing evidence to that effect will pile on the pressure for the chancellor to ease off on austerity measures and loosen the purse strings to invest in growth. Does it matter? Yes and no. It matters enormously to Osborne, who pinned his credibility on keeping the AAA rating. But the financial markets have been expecting this, so traders have already factored in much of the impact. The news will put pressure on the pound, which has been falling against the dollar all year, and that will drive petrol prices higher, as oil is traded in dollars. Economists predict a 2-3% rise over the next few months. What will mean for interest rates?  The government&apos;s borrowing costs have been rising since the third quarter of last year, but that is largely due to rising inflation and an improving outlook in the eurozone, which diminishes the appeal of the UK as a safe haven. Economists do not expect borrowing costs to move much as a result of the downgrade, because investors tend to take their own view on a country&apos;s ability to pay its debts, rather than rely on the rating agencies. What&apos;s more, there are so few economies left with an AAA rating from all three agencies, investors have very little choice of &quot;safe havens&quot;. What countries are still rated triple-A by all three agencies? The only countries left with a gold-plated rating from all three agencies are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, Norway, Netherlands, Singapore, Sweden and Switzerland. But the UK is in good company with this downgrade, which puts it on a level with France and the US.

There was a pause. Then she exclaimed, &quot;Good gracious! I had it here a moment ago!&quot; The nation&apos;s music lovers&apos; breakfast was momentarily interrupted by this grave crisis. Matters were resolved when the errant bulletin was retrieved from the wastepaper basket into which it had fallen. This incident befell Patricia Hughes, acclaimed for her impeccable delivery of announcements and who \u2013 despite possessing a confident-sounding voice \u2013 was petrified of making mistakes such as this one. Patricia, who has died aged 90, was part of a generation of radio announcers who, broadly speaking, were selected for their voices and personalities rather than specialist knowledge or journalistic skills. Until about 1970, even presenters on news and current affairs programmes \u2013 such as Patricia&apos;s near-contemporary Jack de Manio on Today \u2013 mostly had their scripts written for them. In time, these golden voices were swept away by more demotic ones, but they remained fondly remembered by many. Born in Malaya, where her father was a senior executive, Patricia went to school in Sussex and then rejoined her parents in Kuala Lumpur. Following the Japanese invasion at Christmas 1941, she and her mother fled to Singapore. After a short spell in South Africa, Patricia came back to Britain on her own and took a secretarial job with the BBC General Overseas Service (GOS). In due course, she applied for an announcing post and remained with the GOS for about 15 years, also working for the Home Service and for the Third Programme after it was inaugurated in 1946. She moved over to the Light Programme when Jean Metcalfe, one of the few other female announcers at that time, left to have children. Patricia had a brief wartime marriage to a naval officer, which ended in divorce. In 1958, she married John Ginnett, a solicitor, and took a career break in the early 1960s to have a baby. In 1969, she returned to what had just been renamed Radio 3. Chiefly known for introducing the Monday lunchtime concerts from St John&apos;s, Smith Square, she also became noted for poetry and prose readings that she inserted in the nooks and crannies between programmes. Various attempts have been made to characterise her delivery \u2013 of which &quot;dark brown voice&quot; tells only half the story. It was warm, creamy, mellifluous and with a touch of smokiness. Whatever it was, it enthralled listeners. According to BBC rules, she had to retire at the age of 60 in 1983, but there were mutterings that her &quot;cut-glass tones&quot; and &quot;Kensingtonian vowels&quot; \u2013 not to mention her lack of a formal musical qualification \u2013 had become inappropriate for the BBC as it was then developing. When, in 1994, I rescued her from retirement to be a reader on my Radio 4 programme Quote \u2026 Unquote, she said she had almost &quot;come to accept that my voice has been relegated to the scrapheap&quot;. Our listeners made it clear they were not having any of that. When we went on the road, grown men would go weak at the knees at the prospect of meeting her in the flesh. Would it be all right if they gave her some flowers? I would joke that it was a bit like having the Queen on the programme. I soon discovered that, in herself, Patricia was not at all regal. In fact, whatever she sounded like, I was struck by how in need of reassurance she could be. After seven years, she asked to retire a second time and I could not stand in her way. In her final years she continued to enjoy playing the piano \u2013 she had composed her own pieces long ago \u2013 and so her beloved music was with her to the end. She is survived by her daughter, Emma, and two granddaughters, Polly and Lara. \u2022 Patricia Rosemary Hughes, radio announcer, born 26 January 1923; died 8 February 2013"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/25/the-fiver-swansea-league-cup-bradford", "sentences": ["Who knows, they may become curious and decide to watch a game or two&quot; \u2013 Balestier Khalsa chairman S Thavaneson explains why the Singapore S.League team&apos;s players are being made to go door-to-door in a bid to drum up a fan base."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-25T16:24:25Z", "title": "The Fiver | Jennifer Lawrence, the Swansea City of the piece | Barry Glendenning", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "AND THE AWARD FOR BEST FOOTBALL TEAM IN A LEAGUE CUP FINAL GOES TO \u2026 While Seth MacFarlane has been universally panned for his efforts as host of last night&apos;s Oscar ceremony, it should come as no surprise that here at Fiver Towers we think he did a very fine job indeed.

Undoubtedly the underdog, everyone was rooting for Emmanuelle Riva. But then on the other hand, there was Jennifer Lawrence, the Swansea City of the piece: dressed in white, Lawrence is pleasant on the eye, always entertaining and a genuinely down-to-earth crowd-pleaser. Unlikely to threaten the Big Four hegemony of Meryl Streep, Helen Mirren, Sigourney Weaver or Charlize Theron any time soon, she complains about being hungry, laughs off questions about her frock and trips over her own feet. Everyone likes Jennifer Lawrence. &quot;What they have done this season is absolutely outstanding and I think this final this year will remain in history, a small part because of us and a large part because of Bradford,&quot; said Swansea manager Michael Laudrup, helpfully stepping in to rescue us from what could be the first of many very tortured analogies this week.

Moody&apos;s downgrade of the UK&apos;s credit rating and the recent US lawsuit against S&amp;P remind us that credit ratings remain both consequential and controversial. More importantly, they are a byproduct of a broken industry hamstrung by obsolete regulation. Rating agency regulation needs to evolve in order to encourage rather than stifle innovation. Just as TripAdvisor has disrupted the status quo for travel reviews, 21st century technologies can revolutionize the way that fixed income investors glean wisdom about bonds. Rating agencies first found their way into US federal rulemaking in the wake of the Depression. Regulators decided that expert third-party evaluations were needed to ensure that banks were investing depositor funds wisely, especially since taxpayers started guaranteeing deposits under the auspices of the FDIC.  In the 1970s, after rating agencies adopted the issuer pays model, the federal government implemented NRSRO (Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization) registration \u2013 albeit without oversight. Finally, the 2006 Credit Rating Agency Reform Act \u2013 passed in reaction to the controversy over Enron&apos;s and WorldCom&apos;s ratings \u2013 stiffened regulation of NRSROs. To become a new NRSRO, a firm must submit 10 letters from Qualified Institutional Buyers stating that they have happily used the firm&apos;s ratings for at least three years. This requirement is somewhat circular, because it is hard for a new rater to gain attention from institutional buyers without being an NRSRO. Once a rating agency joins the NRSRO club it faces enormous compliance costs in terms of both employee training and reporting. Upstart Egan Jones recently found that the penalties for making errors on mandatory Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings can be quite severe. The compliance burden actually favors the big three because they generate enough revenue to fully staff compliance units. New entrants often lack this luxury. Further, Egan Jones and S&amp;P share two characteristics that should raise an eyebrow: both downgraded the US and subsequently faced disciplinary action from the US government. Perhaps this helps explain why Moody&apos;s chose to downgrade the UK while leaving the US at Aaa. The two countries have virtually identical central government net debt-to-GDP ratios, while the UK has significantly smaller central government deficits and is less subject to interest rate spikes due to the longer average maturity of its bond issues. Expert opinions about bond risk can play an important social role. Since most people lack the time and expertise to thoroughly evaluate these instruments, delegating this task makes sense. Further, correct and credible expert opinions about fixed income securities promote a proper alignment of interest rates to risk, ensuring that our society&apos;s scarce capital is effectively deployed. So rather than simply dismiss the ratings business, we should be trying to fix it. What could a 21st Century rating industry look like? Today, computer models are available to rate all major classes of fixed income securities. In some cases, rating agencies use such models, but the workings of these models and the data entered into them are not fully disclosed. This creates opportunities to massage inputs and outputs, or to ignore potential improvements that produce commercially inconvenient results \u2013 as alleged in the Department of Justice&apos;s complaint against S&amp;P. Further, model results can be overridden by a rating committee, whose proceedings are kept secret. A more modern alternative would leverage open source models with fully transparent inputs and outputs. As with Linux and Wikipedia, the software and data would be open to a worldwide peer review process, which could facilitate their rapid improvement. A number of examples for this radically open approach to credit modeling now exist including the National University of Singapore Risk Management Institute&apos;s Credit Risk Initiative for corporate bonds and this author&apos;s open source public sector credit framework for government bonds. Regulators can accelerate the innovation process by empowering one or more certification boards to review and approve open source credit models. This way, rigorous modeling efforts can be differentiated from the dross that often plagues open source communities. A rough template for such a certification body is the World Wide Web Consortium that sets standards for HTML, XML and other internet technologies. Well-meaning government regulations often have the negative unintended consequence of locking in outmoded ways of conducting business. A modern regulatory regime would empower mass collaboration technologies to improve credit rating performance."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gardening-blog/2013/feb/27/bosco-verticale-vertical-gardening", "sentences": ["This is a kind of biological architecture, which refuses to adopt a strictly technological and mechanical approach to environmental sustainability.&quot;     The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore.", "Photograph: Patrick Bingham-Hall    Singapore sky gardens The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore is another example of a towering building-cum-garden in a dense urban area, but this one is already open for business.", "Apparently Singapore&apos;s taxi drivers now make detours to drive past the planted hotel, while Stefano Boeri talks about his structures being &quot;ecology billboards&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-27T12:00:00Z", "title": "High-rise gardening", "tags": ["Gardens", "Life and style", "Architecture", "Skyscrapers"], "article": "Forget London&apos;s monolithic new Shard, all eyes will surely be on the Bosco Verticale when it opens in Milan at the end of this year.

Rather than cold steel and glass, the surface of this high-rise will ripple with organic life.  Made of two towers \u2013 one 80m high, the other 112m \u2013 Bosco Verticale is currently being planted with 730 specially cultivated trees, 11,000 groundcover plants and 5,000 shrubs.

Trees being installed onto the Bosco Verticale skyscraper in Milan. Photograph: Marco Garofalo    Big deal for &apos;biological architecture&apos;  Jill Fehrenbacher, editor of Inhabitat and a follower of architecture trends, says proposals for buildings featuring copious vegetation are increasingly common. &quot;I have yet to see very many of these &apos;living building&apos; designs become reality, which is why the Bosco Verticale is such a big deal,&quot; she says. The interdisciplinary team working on the project includes botanists as well as engineers. Their research has ventured into testing the wind resistance of certain species of tree in wind tunnels, as well as finding a suitably lightweight substrate able to meet plants&apos; nutritional demands. The residents&apos; needs are also important \u2013 trees will be trimmed so foliage doesn&apos;t interrupt their views.  Boeri explains that the Bosco Verticale &quot;hands over to vegetation itself the task of absorbing the dust in the air and of creating an adequate micro-climate in order to filter out the sunlight. This is a kind of biological architecture, which refuses to adopt a strictly technological and mechanical approach to environmental sustainability.&quot;     The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore. Photograph: Patrick Bingham-Hall    Singapore sky gardens The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore is another example of a towering building-cum-garden in a dense urban area, but this one is already open for business. WOHA, the architects, says it was inspired by headlands, promontories and planted terraces. Richard Hassell, the firm&apos;s founding director, enjoys blurring the distinction between hard architecture and soft landscapes but admits that working with plants is a challenge.  &quot;For architects, it is quite a change in mindset to deal with living things,&quot; he says. &quot;Normally an architect is trying to make things that are as static as possible, and resist wear and tear. But plants grow, and change, and drop leaves, and wilt and die if you forget about them.&quot; Over-ambitious? A &apos;living building&apos; is never really finished. It will change over time and will require much more maintenance than one without plants. For both the Park Royal on Pickering and the Bosco Verticale, the upkeep will be centralised and carried out by specialist staff. Could such projects be called too labour- and energy-intensive? Jill Fehrenbacher doesn&apos;t think so. &quot;Living plants\u2026clean the air and produce oxygen, they help humidify indoor air, they reduce storm water runoff and the urban heat island effect, and they help insulate a building,&quot; she argues. &quot;Even though skyscrapers like the Bosco Verticale inherently use a tonne of resources and energy \u2013 simply by virtue of being a high-rise building \u2013 all of those trees and plants are going to be beneficial to the building occupants, neighbours and local environment.&quot;  And perhaps &apos;living buildings&apos; have worth based on aesthetics alone. &quot;At the very worst, a garden is a delight to the users, so even if there is minimum environmental value, there is still immense value in having more green spaces in dense cities,&quot; says Richard Hassell. The visual impact of buildings like these can&apos;t be underestimated. Apparently Singapore&apos;s taxi drivers now make detours to drive past the planted hotel, while Stefano Boeri talks about his structures being &quot;ecology billboards&quot;. Jill Fehrenbacher says such buildings will be everywhere in twenty years, as we &quot;try to recreate some sort of primeval garden of paradise in our homes and workplaces&quot;. Future landscapes More than mere gardens, planted high-rises have the potential to change our cityscapes. &quot;For sure this is an experiment but to have a sequence of Bosco Verticales, to reach a critical mass, this could be quite interesting,&quot; says Boeri. &quot;To deurbanise the urban environment is a radical alternative to expensive technology.&quot;  The proof of a building&apos;s appeal is surely when the architect himself decides to move in. Boeri has reserved himself a small apartment in Bosco Verticale, explaining he&apos;s &quot;extremely attracted&quot; to the idea of living high up in these soon-to-be leafy towers of trees."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/27/delhi-gang-rape-accused-court", "sentences": ["The victim died in a Singapore clinic of massive internal injuries sustained during the attack."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-27T15:03:24Z", "title": "Delhi gang rape: 17-year-old accused to appear in juvenile court", "tags": ["India", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "Society", "World news"], "article": "A 17-year-old accused of playing a key role in the murder, rape and robbery of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in Delhi last December is scheduled to appear before a special juvenile court in the Indian capital on Thursday. The trial of five adult men accused of involvement in the protracted assault, which took place on busy public roads on a weekend evening after the victim and a male friend boarded an illegal bus while returning from the cinema, has opened at a newly established &quot;fast track court&quot; set up specifically to deal with the case to deliver speedy justice earlier this month. They face the death sentence. The sixth accused, as a minor, is being tried in a separate process in a juvenile court. Legal experts say he faces a maximum of three years in jail if convicted. The victim died in a Singapore clinic of massive internal injuries sustained during the attack. Police officials this week told the Guardian that their case against the teenager, who comes from a remote village in the poor and violent northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, will be based on a statement given to investigators shortly after his arrest two days after the crime, the witness statements of the victim&apos;s friend, and DNA evidence that they say links him to the attack. Lawyers for the accused have described the alleged confession as worthless, alleging it was made under duress following torture by police officers. Only statements before a magistrate, not simply to police, are admissible as evidence, they say. The statement gives harrowing and graphic details of the crime. Viewed by the Guardian, it also describes how the semi-literate teenager left a home broken by poverty and mental illness to come to Delhi six years ago, working first in scruffy roadside food stalls serving cheap meat dishes in a poor part of the Indian capital&apos;s eastern urban sprawl. A stall owner who had employed the teenager said he had been a &quot;good worker&quot; whose wages had gone from 1,500 rupees (\u00a318) to 3,000 rupees (\u00a337) per month. The teenager, who has not been publicly named, met Ram Singh, the oldest of the five men accused of the attack, 18 months ago and worked as a helper for a short period on the bus Singh drove. More recently he had been working on other unlicensed buses but had come to the slum neighbourhood where Singh lived in south Delhi on the weekend of the rape to see his friend about some money. On the evening of the attack, Singh was joined by his younger brother and a 24-year-old who had replaced the teenager as an assistant on his bus. Singh proposed taking the vehicle to &quot;go out and have some fun&quot;, according to the document. Police officials claim that the trio regularly went on &quot;joy rides&quot; during which the proceeds of robberies would be used to pay sex workers. On the night of the attack, the three men and the teenager were joined by two other local men, a fruitseller and a part-time gym assistant. Singh&apos;s brother drove the bus, another man acted as a conductor calling out for prospective fares and the others pretended to be passengers, the statement says. One man who got on the bus was beaten and robbed. Then at around 9pm the victim and her 28-year-old male friend, who was seeing her home after an evening watching a film at an upscale mall in south Delhi, got on board. &quot;A boy and a girl climbed into the bus. They both sat down and the boy asked\u00a0\u2026 &apos;in how much time will we get there?&apos;,&quot; the teenager told the police, according to the statement. The pair handed over 10 rupees (12p) each for the journey but moments after the doors of the bus were shut, a scuffle broke out when one of the men asked the victim&apos;s friend what he was doing &quot;roaming around&quot; with a woman. &quot;[Ram Singh] gave the boy a slap and the boy pushed him away. Then all of them got together and started hitting the boy with punches and kicks. [The boy] was uncontrollable. [One man] took out an iron rod and hit the boy&apos;s head and started hitting left and right on all the other parts of his body. Then [three men] got hold of the girl and took her to the back of the bus. They beat her and put her on the seat with one hand pressed on her mouth and tore her clothes off,&quot; the statement says. The teenager went on to describe the victim&apos;s resistance to the extremely violent assault, her serious internal injuries and loss of consciousness. Convinced by massive bleeding that the woman was dead, the men decided to throw her and her friend out of the moving bus on the roadside near Delhi&apos;s international airport, said the statement, which ended with the words: &quot;I committed a mistake and please pardon me.&quot; A second document, the statement of the victim&apos;s male friend, corroborates many of the details in the teenager&apos;s account, though diverges in others. All of the accused in the case have pleaded not guilty. MK Sharma, one of their legal team, said that the prosecution needed to establish that the accused had been correctly identified before &quot;questions of evidence are even considered&quot;. Sharma said his client, the younger Singh brother, had been wrongly indentified but did not have an &quot;alibi&quot; because he was not &quot;wealthy&quot;, a reference to the practice of paying people to support claims that defendants had been wrongly accused in criminal cases. In response to public outrage, the Indian government has tightened laws against sexual violence and has promised further legislation. A new law on sexual harassment in the workplace was passed by the Indian parliament earlier this week. Scores of witnesses are to be heard in the trial, which may take up to three months to complete, lawyers have said. The trial of the teenager is expected to be completed more rapidly, officials say."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/feb/28/uk-fight-eu-cap-bankers-bonuses", "sentences": ["&quot;The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-28T13:29:20Z", "title": "UK to fight EU plan to cap bankers' bonuses", "tags": ["Executive pay and bonuses", "Business", "Banking", "Banking reform", "Financial sector", "European Union", "Europe", "World news", "UK news", "Politics", "London"], "article": "     Britain is to challenge an EU agreement to slash bankers&apos; bonuses at a meeting of European finance ministers next week after Boris Johnson condemned the proposal as a &quot;deluded measure&quot;. Amid fears that the EU agreement could deal a hammer blow to the City of London, David Cameron said EU regulations needed to be flexible enough to allow international banks to operate in Britain and the rest of the European Union. George Osborne or the Treasury minister Greg Clark will represent Britain at the meeting next week to relay what No 10 described as real concerns about the proposal. The agreement in Brussels came as the Royal Bank of Scotland posted losses of more than \u00a35bn after paying out more than \u00a3600m in bonuses. No 10 said it had imposed cash limits of \u00a32,000 on bonuses at RBS and Lloyds and was giving a greater say to shareholders in all banks. The prime minister&apos;s spokesman said: &quot;Bonuses are very significantly down on where they were in 2010. So you are seeing real responsibility and restraint.&quot; Johnson highlighted deep British unease about the bonus agreement hammered out in Brussels on Wednesday night between officials from the EU&apos;s 27 member states, MEPs and the European commission by dismissing it as the most preposterous idea in Europe in two millennia. Under the agreement, bankers&apos; bonuses would be capped broadly at a year&apos;s salary, although they could be doubled if a majority of shareholders agreed. The London mayor said: &quot;People will wonder why we stay in the EU if it persists in such transparently self-defeating policies. Brussels cannot control the global market for banking talent. Brussels cannot set pay for bankers around the world. &quot;The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU. This is possibly the most deluded measure to come from Europe since Diocletian tried to fix the price of groceries across the Roman empire.&quot; Diocletian, the 51st Roman emperor, introduced the edict on maximum prices in AD 301. The prime minister made clear the government&apos;s unease at a meeting of Nordic leaders in the Latvian capital of Riga. &quot;We do have in the UK \u2013 and not every other European country has this \u2013 we have major international banks that are based in the UK but have branches and activities all over the world, and we need to make sure that regulation put in place in Brussels is flexible enough to allow those banks to continue competing and succeeding while being located in the UK. So we&apos;ll look carefully at what the outcome of the negotiations was before working out the approach we&apos;ll take at Ecofin [the meeting of EU finance ministers] next week.&quot; Downing Street made clear Britain was prepared to water down the proposal at the meeting, though any final decision will be made by qualified majority voting in which no member state has a national veto. Cameron&apos;s spokesman said Britain had taken important steps to rein in remuneration, such as deferred payments, which has seen \u00a3300m clawed back from Barclays bonuses and 3,000 RBS employees also experiencing &quot;clawback&quot; as a result of the Libor investigations. He said: &quot;The UK believes it has some of the toughest remuneration requirements in the world. They are incentivising long-term behaviour \u2013 the idea of deferred payments, with a significant proportion in shares that can be clawed back over a period of time. At the heart of this is aligning the incentives with long-term performance and stability. &quot;Alongside that we of course also want a successful financial sector in the UK. There are very successful UK-based firms that compete across the world. They are an asset to the UK. When we are looking at what further regulations may be appropriate we will want to consider the impact on competitiveness. &quot;This idea of a cap \u2013 one of the things we have been pointing out as a potential consequence of this type of approach, if you cap variable pay \u2013 bonuses \u2013 you can see big increases in basic pay. And of course basic pay is not subject to clawback because it is paid out straight away.&quot; Cameron said Britain was taking a responsible approach because it was implementing the Vickers proposal to ringfence the retail side of banks away from the investment side. &quot;We are absolutely clear that we must be able to implement the Vickers plan in the UK, which in some ways is tougher than regulations that are being put in place in other European countries. We want to have this proper ringfence between retail banks and investment banks, and the rules must allow that to happen \u2013 I think that is very important.&quot; The spokesman added: &quot;We do continue to have real concerns about them [these proposals] and we will continue to be discussing them with EU partners in the coming days ahead of the Ecofin.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/01/eu-ball-chain-unshackle-ourselves", "sentences": ["Given the choice, you would surely ally yourself to countries that are doing better, such as Singapore, which is second in the table of labour market efficiency; or the US, which is sixth."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T19:00:01Z", "title": "Europe is a ball and chain \u2013 we should unshackle ourselves | Terry Smith", "tags": ["European Union", "Europe", "World news", "UK news", "Business", "Financial sector"], "article": "In deciding whether we want to be part of the EU we should ask ourselves whether or not it is advantageous to the UK to be part of that trading bloc. A trading bloc is advantageous if it enables us to access a larger free market for our goods and services. Economic theory from Adam Smith to David Ricardo shows that our prosperity is enhanced when we are able to focus on those goods and services that we are best at, and trade them with others who have different skills. How is that going with our EU partners? Not very well judging by last year&apos;s Office for National Statistics figures. We have a negative balance of trade of \u00a355.7bn with our EU partners: they sold us far more than we sold them. And it is clear from their actions in terms of regulation that they would like to snaffle and/or stifle our biggest industry \u2013 financial services \u2013 as the proposed curbs on bankers&apos; bonuses demonstrates. For all its faults, this is our biggest sector for employment, exports and tax revenues, and the suggested curbs will place us at a disadvantage when competing with US and Asian banks and financial institutions. And if we are part of a trading bloc, shouldn&apos;t we want to be part of a thriving trading bloc? The EU is hardly thriving. Leaving aside the obvious and overwhelming anecdotal evidence, the fact is the EU is the least competitive trading bloc in the world. If you look at the World Economic Forum&apos;s global competitiveness report for 2012-13 for labour market efficiency you see the following rankings out of 144 countries surveyed: UK, 5th; Netherlands, 17th; Germany, 53rd; France, 66th; Spain, 108th; Italy, 127th; Greece, 133rd. You get similar results for other measures, such as pay and productivity, in which the UK is ranked 13th; Germany 41st; Italy 128th; and so on. The impact of the EU&apos;s dire performance shows in the fact that in 1980 it represented 31% of world GDP but in 2012 it was down to 19%, and by 2017 is forecast to fall to 17%. Binding ourselves to the EU is like trying to run a race with a ball and chain as we are forced to import the labour practices and business regulation of countries that are the losers in global competitiveness. Given the choice, you would surely ally yourself to countries that are doing better, such as Singapore, which is second in the table of labour market efficiency; or the US, which is sixth. Do not be fooled into thinking that this is impossible, or that we have to be in a trading bloc with Europe because of our geographical proximity to it. Britain had successful trading relationships that spanned the globe over a century ago, when distance was a real obstacle to doing business. In a world increasingly dominated by the internet, digital business, and near universal access to jet travel, distance is irrelevant. You will of course hear from the pro- EU lobby that we cannot separate from the EU as it will then cease to trade with us on favourable terms. Remember that our EU partners sell us \u00a356bn more than we sell them. Will they risk losing this? The prominent members of this lobby, such as Ken Clarke, Peter Mandelson and Richard Branson, are the same cast of characters who campaigned for the UK to join the euro and who forecast disaster for the UK in general and the City in particular if we did not. How do their predictions look now? Perhaps we should ask the people of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and soon France what they think of the merits of euro membership as they struggle with unemployment of over 25% in some cases and youth unemployment of over 50%. In fact, the Italian electorate was asked last weekend and the EU appointee Mario Monti came fourth behind a retired comedian and Silvio Berlusconi, which takes some doing. In any other walk of life, anyone with the pro-euro lobby&apos;s abysmal record of forecasting would be ignored \u2013 or be so ashamed that they would withdraw from the debate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/mar/01/benefits-bankers-bonuses-earth-all-together", "sentences": ["And if these pin-striped \u00fcbermensch don&apos;t get what they want, they will have a tantrum and stomp off to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-01T19:29:01Z", "title": "We cap benefits but not bonuses.

This is the message the government wants to give about austerity. Everyone has to shoulder a part of the load. Each of us must do our bit. We are the &quot;big society&quot;, knitted together by a common project of national togetherness in the face of adversity. This has become the familiar rhetorical window-dressing of a massive and unprecedented assault upon the most vulnerable people in our society. The big society is a lie. From later on this year, the sum total of a family&apos;s benefit entitlement will be capped at \u00a3500 a week. For those who have larger families and are living in places like London, where rents are ridiculously high and rising steeply, this is not nearly enough to get by. Even without the cap on benefits, ordinary people are being forced out of central London by escalating costs. In Westminster, housing benefit claims have gone down 20% since March 2010, while in places like Barnet and Newham, they went up over 40%, demonstrating clearly how the poor are being squeezed out. Soon London will look like Paris, with rich people living in the centre and poor, often immigrant, communities hidden out of sight beyond the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique. The consequence of this mass deportation will be that outer London boroughs will not be able to cope and will cook up ways of shunting the vulnerable further afield, cutting people off from their traditional communities and forms of informal support. Inevitably, homelessness, both in the form of rough sleeping and sofa-surfing, is massively on the rise again. According to the government, this benefit cap is absolutely necessary. So too is the cap of 1% on any increases in benefit until 2017-18, which means that benefits will rise well below the rate of inflation. But when it comes to capping bankers&apos; bonuses, the Tories and their Lib Dem sidekicks have been screaming blue murder. This week, the EU proposed that bonuses ought to be no more than 100% of bankers&apos; annual salaries, or 200% if sanctioned by shareholders. Someone earning \u00a31m could thus get an extra \u00a32m if their work is deemed of sufficient value to the firm. But apparently, this is not nearly enough. This cap is unfair, they say. Bonuses should be unlimited. And if these pin-striped \u00fcbermensch don&apos;t get what they want, they will have a tantrum and stomp off to Singapore. Well, let them go. We do not want a London set up simply as a playground for the super rich. If immigration is a problem, the problem is that of international jet-setting billionaires forcing up house prices by investing in property portfolios and Docklands penthouses they rarely live in, thus creating mini glass and steel ghost towns, gated off from the real world, and forcing up the overheated market beyond the reach of ordinary people. How can the government keep on talking about us all being in it together with a straight face? The bankers were substantially responsible for creating this financial mess, yet whenever there is talk of limiting the bonus culture that incentivised all the absurd risk-taking that got us into this trouble, the government steps in to side with the wealthy. No, the opposite of the big society is now the case. London is becoming the tale of two cities \u2013 the poor are capped, the rich are protected. From my parish at the Elephant and Castle, we can see the City; but it might as well be a million miles away. These are different worlds where different rules apply. And when a society gets so out of kilter with itself, social disorder is not far round the corner. Remember the riots? I suspect we haven&apos;t seen the last of them.

He\u00a0combines\u00a0a professorship\u00a0at the University of North Carolina with writing books and articles on the subject, with a consultancy advising regional and national governments how to direct their billions to the achievement of their own aerotropolis.\u00a0Boris Johnson has declared his enthusiasm for the idea, and Kasarda reciprocates his passion: &quot;I find the mayor of London extremely visionary. He has his\u00a0finger on the pulse. He has a dramatic style, but he&apos;s a very wise man.&quot; There is, Kasarda says, a &quot;new metric based on time and cost&quot;, and &quot;location, location, location has been replaced by accessibility, accessibility, accessibility&quot;. Kasarda supports his arguments with batteries of statistics and predictions \u2013 that in 2030 there will be 13bn passenger journeys a year, compared with 4.9bn in 2010,\u00a0or that an iPhone 5 is assembled from parts flown in from several countries.     Arlanda airport in Sweden, a popular wedding venue. Photograph: Alamy    As airports grow, argues Kasarda, they become more city-like. The shopping zone of Indianapolis International, he says, &quot;really gives the feeling&quot; of a town square. There are 6,000 weddings a year at Stockholm Arlanda, the Rijksmuseum exhibits art in Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, and the London Philharmonic is performing at Heathrow. &quot;If you want to see the future,&quot; he says, &quot;look at the Squaire&quot; \u2013 a sleek, glassy slug in Frankfurt where KPMG has moved some of its operations, on the basis that it is only a few minutes&apos; walk from workplace to check-in.     The Squaire, an office building inside Frankfurt airport: 'minutes' walk from workplace to check-in'. Photograph: Alamy    Kasarda&apos;s favourite examples of an aerotropolis are Las Colinas, Texas, which is handily placed for Dallas Fort Worth and &quot;hosts four Global Fortune 500 headquarters&quot;, and New Songdo, a development built (with advice from Kasarda) near Incheon airport in South Korea. Also, Dubai, &quot;an airport with an emirate attached&quot;, and Singapore, whose growth has been assisted by its impressive airport. He shows a plan of an ideal city, with runways at its dead centre and &quot;aerolanes&quot; connecting such things as &quot;E-fulfilment facilities&quot; and a &quot;medical and wellness cluster&quot;. This city is shown as being built on virgin greensward, a site very unlike London, which already has a large number of buildings and services, and people who might resist relocation. Kasarda calls the existing fabric &quot;sunk cost&quot;, which roughly means &quot;money down the drain&quot;, before acknowledging that they might have some value: &quot;You can&apos;t get rid of it, so you have to leverage it as best you can.&quot;     Dubai International, 'an airport with an emirate attached'. Photograph: Corbis    Kasarda is right that international air travel is a growing force, and that London will suffer if it fails to find an intelligent response. But, as currently described, aerotropolis is chilling: a model of a city driven by a combination\u00a0of business imperatives and state control, with the high levels of security\u00a0and control that go with airports. Under the dictatorship of speed, individual memory and identity\u00a0are abolished. An airport shopping mall is, actually, not like a town square, for the reason that everything there is programmed and managed, and spontaneity and initiative are abolished. There may be palliatives. According to Kasarda&apos;s 10 points for planning aerotropolises, &quot;thematic architectural features, public art and iconic structures should make aerotropolis developments interpretable, navigable and welcoming&quot;. New Songdo includes a Jack Nicklaus golf course and areas modelled on Venetian canals and Central Park. But, according to sociologist Richard Sennett, it&apos;s a &quot;stupefying&quot; place where &quot;there is nothing to be learned from walking the streets&quot;. Nor are airport cities precisely pure expressions of the market, as some 19th-century railway towns were. The South Korean government has invested heavily in New Songdo, which has yet to prove that it will be the humming metropolis promised by its makers. Of the plan to build a new airport in the Thames estuary, Kasarda tells me that &quot;most airport transportation connectivity will need to be based on public funding, and this will be expensive. I know of no significant commercial airport that has been privately built that had not received substantial public funding support, at least indirectly.&quot; The deal, in other words, is this: taxpayers would be expected to pay handsomely for an environment created almost entirely to serve the needs of business. If they don&apos;t, as Kasarda says of a Britain without enhanced airports in London, &quot;the city and nation\u00a0will become markedly weakened in the coming decades&quot;. And if the public does foot the bill, the bet might not pay off. &quot;The Thames estuary airport is a high-risk but potentially\u00a0very high-return option,&quot; says Kasarda. In\u00a0other words, the taxpayer might be asked to stake billions upon billions on something that may not work. When London meets aerotropolis, it is quite a face-off. If the game is simply to see who can build airports (and eve rything that goes with them) biggest, fastest and most efficiently, then London, which carries the baggage of history and democracy, cannot beat Asian cities. On the other hand, London has qualities to which the aerotropolis idea adds little value, like an existing fabric that works and gives pleasure and affords space for the accidental (including the colossal and largely unplanned success,\u00a0over the decades, of Heathrow). The evidence of property prices, and of international investment,\u00a0is that these things are worth quite a lot. London can never afford to be complacent \u2013 not least about the current state of its airports \u2013 but the aerotropolis idea offers a too simplistic view of cities. I hope that Boris Johnson understands."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/03/emirates-new-concourse-dubai-silk-road", "sentences": ["Etihad&apos;s investment in, and partnership with, Virgin Australia is one way that the journey now bypasses Singapore and Heathrow too."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-03T00:05:43Z", "title": "Emirates' concourse for A380s is another staging post on new Silk Road", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Middle East and North Africa", "Heathrow", "United Arab Emirates", "United Arab Emirates holidays"], "article": "Multiplying lanes, stretching runways and new terminals in the sands may not be everyone&apos;s idea of making the desert bloom. But in Abu Dhabi, where the aviation industry has grown up almost as spectacularly as the skyscrapers on the shoreline, the sheikhs who bankrolled the towering investment do not doubt that the fruits will come. While London&apos;s great and good grapple with the question of airport expansion, the world beyond is changing, as those running Britain&apos;s biggest airport and airline know all too well \u2013 frequently expressing their frustration that rivals are &quot;eating our lunch&quot; and leapfrogging them to aviation&apos;s top spot. The announcements last week that Etihad Airways \u2013 based in Abu Dhabi \u2013 was splurging $70m (\u00a347m) to secure three Heathrow slots, while British Airways saw its profits wiped out and its parent company, IAG, record a near-\u20ac1bn (\u00a3863m) loss, will not have made them much happier. &quot;In aviation,&quot; says Jos Nuihuis, the boss of Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, mischievously enjoying his role as the current chief beneficiary of Heathrow&apos;s inability to build another runway, &quot;you have to take the chance when it&apos;s your\u00a0turn.&quot; While the northern hemisphere and transatlantic traffic draws the money, Europe&apos;s five hubs can do battle. But the political geography is changing and the crossroads of the world look ever more likely to be located in the Middle East. Developments at the three expanding hubs in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates underline that shift. The UAE&apos;s biggest airline, Emirates, last month completed the opening of an entire 20-gate concourse at its Dubai airport base purely for its fleet of giant A380s, Airbus&apos;s flagship aircraft which typically carry 500-plus passengers. Etihad \u2013 which was established less than a decade ago \u2013 announced that passenger numbers had passed 10 million a year and it was turning increasing profits, as plans to double the airport capacity take shape. And in Qatar, the $15.5bn Hamad International airport opens next month with a 4,850m runway fit for fleets of A380s to take off in the desert heat. The ambition is immense, as is the speed and scale of the growth to date. Qatar&apos;s airport will be able to handle 28 million passengers a year on opening, but chief executive Akbar al-Baker is planning extensions for 50 million by 2020, when the state hosts the football World Cup. In the gleaming new headquarters of Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, the airline&apos;s chief executive, James Hogan, spells out a vision of being a &quot;truly global airline&quot;. Staff drawn from 125 countries come through the training facility on site, the graduating class photos spreading along the walls showing a multinational mix in each intake. With 70 planes, Etihad is the smallest of the Gulf airlines, and all three have orders that will more than double their existing fleets. &quot;With aircraft technology you can fly to all points in the world from the Gulf,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;We fly to 86 cities and connect well [at] Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi itself as a destination is becoming more relevant.&quot; For many British passengers, long-haul to the south and east of the globe has meant going on the classic Kangaroo route to Australia via Asia. But the longer range of modern aircraft and the rise of the Gulf hubs has set a new course for the Gulf and south east Asia. Etihad&apos;s investment in, and partnership with, Virgin Australia is one way that the journey now bypasses Singapore and Heathrow too. More notably, at the end of this month Emirates will take over from the ousted British Airways in a partnership with Australian flag carrier Qantas. Qantas&apos;s UK general manager, Eric Jelinek, said it was an &quot;amicable divorce&quot; from Heathrow&apos;s largest carrier: &quot;BA understands our reasons and that things have changed.&quot; He doesn&apos;t extend the metaphor, but has the air of a man whose airline has found a younger, richer, more glamorous partner, really going places and unsullied by previous trysts. This is Emirates&apos; first alliance, and Qantas is clearly overjoyed to have been chosen. For its Australian passengers flying via Heathrow, it offered five European destinations, with two stops. Now it can sell 33 with just the one stop. Qantas has since reported a surge in ticket sales from Australia to Europe. The Gulf hubs are undoubtedly well-placed to update some long-established routes. As Hogan, a native Australian, puts it: &quot;It&apos;s the new Silk Road.&quot; But, he adds: &quot;What people forget is that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh are huge populations. And even in the Middle East: at a point, post-Arab spring, when the Middle East normalises, Iraq and Iran have huge numbers of young people who want to travel. &quot;If you think within three hours&apos; flying time we have India \u2013 for them this is a weekend destination, a short break destination, an educational or medical care destination. &quot;You want sun, beaches, restaurants, shopping, it&apos;s here all year round. The Gulf states, the subcontinent and the Middle East all see Abu Dhabi as a destination in its own right, as well as all the through traffic.&quot; If Dubai&apos;s tourist industry and hotel scene is well-established, Abu Dhabi has plans to make a different type of tourist sit up, with a new Louvre, Guggenheim and national museum in fantastical designs from the world&apos;s leading architects on a newly linked island on the city&apos;s edge. Such breathtaking, vaulting ambition typifies the Gulf but also leads many observers to question if these are Ozymandian dreams, unsustainable follies in the sand. Can the vast oil wells in the desert successfully nurture not just one but three burgeoning aviation hubs, two within an hour&apos;s drive of each other? John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, believes so: &quot;Probably they can. If you look at where they&apos;re sitting and the aircraft they&apos;re operating, they can serve pretty much anywhere in the world. None of them are having any difficulty filling their planes.&quot; Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, predicts: &quot;They will grow very seriously and gain status as major global aviation hubs. They sit at the crossroads from Europe to the east and between Africa and Asia, which are young and vibrant markets.&quot; But the backing of their governments has, he says, been the driver that has capitalised on that geographical logic. Strickland points out that, while the political aspirations of the various emirates mean that all want their own flag carrier and hub, and are backing aviation to the hilt, all three airlines are believed to be heading for profitability (although the accounts are not all transparent). &quot;You&apos;re not talking about carriers which are bleeding as businesses or in terms of the profits.&quot; Etihad&apos;s own strategy of investing in partner airlines is questioned by some analysts \u2013 &quot;when you see them buying parts of Air Seychelles or Air Berlin you do wonder what they&apos;re doing,&quot; says one \u2013 but the depth of the airline&apos;s pockets is emphasised by moves to take a major stake in Indian airline Jet to secure its three Heathrow slots. &quot;Remember that the European flag carriers are retreating,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;You&apos;re not going to see them operating into Tripoli, Basra, Baghdad.&quot; Not to mention other destinations closer to home: &quot;We fly into Manchester. BA isn&apos;t flying out of Manchester.&quot; This, says Strickland, shows where Gulf airlines can directly compete with Heathrow right now. &quot;While we&apos;re agonising about runways in the south-east, they have no capacity constraint and can offer a very attractive proposition to travellers in the UK. If you&apos;re in Manchester or Newcastle you can bypass London altogether.&quot; Intriguingly, Heathrow boss Colin Matthews \u2013 who now counts Qatar&apos;s sovereign wealth fund as a major shareholder with a 20% stake and has Al-Baker on his board \u2013 has started to make a virtue of the growth of the Gulf hubs, as well as Istanbul. He twice suggested at a business event last week that projections of growing passenger demand in the UK might have to be downplayed as aviation&apos;s focus shifts, meaning that a third runway, rather than a new four-runway facility outside London, might be sufficient for future needs. Scant consolation, perhaps, for a struggling European aviation industry that could do without the competition \u2013 and unfair competition with subsidised fuel, some have complained, although Hogan says it is &quot;a myth&quot; that he has access to free kerosene or money. Strickland, though, suggests that the future is one where the Gulf players become ever more prominent, but also more integrated \u2013 and those that embrace them will do best. &quot;Capacity constraints here are going to help their growth, and some of the markets are ones that Europe cannot access. Traffic flows such as China to Africa or even Asia to Latin America are going to be the great growth of the 21st century.&quot; Instead, European long-haul airlines might, Strickland suggests, have to emulate a Ryanair-style model on a global basis. Passengers now are used to taking an Irish plane from Stockholm to Madrid. That possible evolution might mean BA flying passengers from Latin America to China via a future BA base \u2013 in Dubai. Meanwhile, Europe&apos;s aviation industry has to get used to the fact that the Gulf money it has seen splashed again last week has radically tilted aviation&apos;s playing field, even more than the sponsorship of Man City and Paris St Germain has skewed football. Even the analyst who questions Etihad&apos;s investment strategy, likening it to the ill-fated SwissAir that was dragged under by partner airlines, points to an essential difference: &quot;Switzerland has got a lot of chocolate. And the UAE has got a lot of oil.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/mar/05/uk-universities-times-higher-reputation", "sentences": ["The National University of Singapore, the Republic of Korea&apos;s Seoul National University, the University of Hong Kong and the National Taiwan University have improved their rankings."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-05T06:00:04Z", "title": "UK universities slide down greasy pole of perception", "tags": ["Higher education", "MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine", "University of Oxford", "The Times", "University of Cambridge", "Leeds", "London", "South Korea", "Harvard University", "Taiwan", "Hong Kong", "UK news", "Sheffield", "Newspapers & magazines", "US news", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Education", "Media", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Fewer British universities have this year made it into the world&apos;s top 100 colleges, as ranked by reputation.

Osborne had travelled to Brussels in a vain attempt to defeat proposals outlined last week to set a limit of a year&apos;s salary on bankers&apos; bonuses, protecting the status of the City and Britain&apos;s biggest industry \u2013 financial services. &quot;I cannot support the proposal on the table,&quot; he told the session. But his pleawas ignored and Britain was left isolated, with no other government opposing the move - which was also supported by the European Central Bank and the European Commission. The City is by far the EU&apos;s biggest financial centre and financial services are a tenth of the UK economy. It is an absolute, if unspoken, rule that EU governments never take decisions opposed by a national government if it feels that vital interests are imperilled. Germany had invariably supported Britain on issues of EU regulation of financial services. It is also not yet clear if the bonus caps will apply to European bank subsidiaries operating outside the EU or \u2013 as some governments want \u2013 to US banks in London, Frankfurt and Paris. The &quot;broad political support&quot; to clamp down on bankers represents a watershed in Britain&apos;s relations with the EU, which have seldom been in greater uncertainty as a result of David Cameron&apos;s actions in using a veto at an EU summit, when he demanded an overhaul of the terms of UK membership and pledged a referendum on whether to stay in the EU if he wins a second term in 2015. Martin Schulz, the parliament president acknowledged the UK&apos;s position but said &quot;An agreement has been reached on all aspects of the legislation. There is no possible route for one member state to block the legislation. It would appear that one state has severe difficulties with the agreement but the EU must press ahead and get this important legislation on the statute book.&quot; In what looked like a move to give Osborne an opportunity to save some face, Germany suggested a slight postponement and slight adjustment of the new regime. The timing and some of the fine detail of how the limits are implemented are to be re-negotiated over the next three weeks. But there was no doubt that the central decision, to clamp down on bonuses, was irreversible. Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market said the year&apos;s salary ceiling - or payouts equal to two years&apos; salary only if approved by a large majority of a bank&apos;s shareholders - was set in stone. He said it was &quot;crystal clear&quot; that the cap would go ahead. Barnier rounded on the recklessness of the casino capitalism culture he blamed for the financial crises of the past five years, arguing that bankers were being rewarded for dangerous risk-taking, while taxpayers had to foot the bills for their failures. &quot;Enough. It&apos;s over,&quot; he declared. The new regime is to apply to 8,300 banks. Barnier wished &quot;good luck&quot; to those in London mulling legal action to try to overturn the bonus ceilings. The new legislation, he said, would be on &quot;a very solid legal basis.&quot; Session chairman, Michael Noonan of Ireland, said the meeting achieved &quot;broad political support&quot; for the limits on bankers&apos; remuneration. Osborne came under attack from Labour for being too slow to try to counter the new legislation and for failing to table alternative proposals over the past couple of years. &quot;It shouldn&apos;t take the EU to rein in excessive bonuses,&quot; said Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor. He accused Osborne of &quot;failing to engage with these sensible proposals until the very last minute. It&apos;s no wonder that in Brussels he was outnumbered 26 to 1.&quot; Arlene McCarthy, the Labour MEP and vice-chair of the parliament&apos;s economic and monetary committee, said: &quot;Yet again, we have an example of the government&apos;s failure to proactively engage in and influence EU policy in Britain&apos;s national interest. Why has the UK government failed in the last 18 months to put an alternative proposal on the table, and waited until the last minute to raise objections?&quot; Osborne had mounted a robust argument against the proposals, asserting the curbs could have a &quot;perverse&quot; effect, generating steep rises in bankers&apos; pay, breaking the link between performance and bonuses, and making it more difficult to &quot;claw back&quot; bonuses when unmerited. Wolfgang Schaeuble, the German finance minister, offered a way to soothe the British, hoping to coax Osborne into not voting against the new rules, expected to come into force next year. The German said he wanted avoid pushing the contentious issue to a vote. The question is subject to a qualified majority vote where Britain can oppose but cannot veto. However, it is extremely rare for a vote to be taken. Schaeuble said he wanted the issue carried by consensus, proposing there should be further talks on &quot;technical details.&quot;&quot;There are a few technical issues still to be clarified,&quot; he said. &quot;Then I hope in the end the United Kingdom will agree.&quot; The details still to be settled involve how the bonuses are structured, when they are implemented, and who is subject to them. Under the existing proposal, 25% of a bonus can be made in the form of deferred payments which are discounted. Britain is trying to get that figure increased, perhaps to 30%, probably with Berlin&apos;s support. Osborne is also seeking to delay the measures taking effect and may win a 6-12 months postponement. Any changes will need to blessed by the European Parliament which drove the new caps regime through. Barnier said: &quot;Remuneration is a sensitive issue, sensitive for our citizens, for our taxpayers. We want to discourage risk-taking. Enough is enough. We&apos;ve got to put a stop to that.&quot; The CBI said the bonus cap would hit the UK hard: &quot;The proposals will damage the competitiveness of the EU&apos;s financial services industry, hitting the UK particularly hard, at a time when growth should be the key priority.&quot; Britain&apos;s powerful financial sector fears the rules will put London at a disadvantage and provoke an exodus of major banks and staff to rival financial centres. A spokesman for London-based Standard Chartered Bank said: &quot;We are concerned about it because we are a global bank and 97% of our staff are outside the EU. We are concerned about our ability to be competitive in attracting and retaining talent.&quot; The new rules will not affect most bank staff, who on average earn bonuses of up to 30% of salary, but target senior management and so-called &quot;risk takers&quot;, such as traders, whose bonuses can be many times their base salary. Analysts estimate the law will initially affect around 300 to 500 people in each large bank, or around 5,000 people in London all told. One hedge fund manager told Reuters the cap could not be enforced: &quot;Things like this are completely unpoliceable. If you tax people for writing with their left hand, they&apos;ll write with their right hand.&quot; Views of bonus cap For  Reduce risk and protect taxpayers The EU insists that smaller bonuses will give bankers less incentive to gamble, avoiding a repeat of the excess that led to the financial crisis. Bankers should share the pain With the world economy struggling and eurozone unemployment at record levels, many argue it&apos;s right to rein in City excess. Encourage banks to focus on smaller customers  Austrian MEP Othmar Karas believes bonus caps are part of a sea change in European banking, forcing them to concentrate on small and medium-sized enterprises. Against Bankers will flee Europe This is Boris Johnson predicted: &quot;The most this measure can hope to achieve is a boost for Zurich and Singapore and New York at the expense of a struggling EU.&quot; Basic salaries will be raised Banks could get around the cap by increasing basic take-home pay.

Chime, which has focused on sports marketing after the sale of its Bell Pottinger-branded PR agencies to Chime&apos;s founder Lord Bell last year, earned about \u00a330m from the London Games. Its operating income grew 35% to \u00a3157.5m in 2012, according to preliminary results published on Wednesday. Operating profit was up 64% to \u00a325.7m. Its sport and entertainment division CSM, of which London Games supremo Lord Coe is its executive chairman, saw operating income up 65% to \u00a365.9m and operating profit more than double (105%) to \u00a315.8m. New contract wins for the company, announced today, included branding and signage for the 2014 football World Cup in Brazil as well as its forerunner, the Fifa Confederations Cup, also in Brazil, in 2013. It has also been appointed as lead agency for the football under-17 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates, and will provide torch relay and hospitality services for the 2014 Winter Olympics. &quot;Our Olympic and Paralympic activity was extremely successful and this is already helping us create opportunities for other major sporting events,&quot; said the company. Chime&apos;s advertising and marketing services business grew operating income by 10% to \u00a354.3m but operating profit fell 35% to \u00a34.4m, attributed to the cost of investing in new startups in Madrid and Sydney. The company also opened new offices in Moscow, Singapore and Sochi, the Russian city which will host the Winter Olympics. Lord Bell, best known as Margaret Thatcher&apos;s favourite PR man in the 1980s, is no longer on the company&apos;s board following the sale of the Bell Pottinger businesses. Chime&apos;s shares were flat in early trading, at 247p. Christopher Satterthwaite, chief executive of Chime Communications, said: &quot;2012 was a year of strong performance for Chime&apos;s on-going businesses.  &quot;During the period, we realigned the group as an international communications and sports marketing business, invested in our digital offering and opened new offices in Europe, the Far East and Australasia which offer good potential returns.  &quot;This concentration of activity in specific sectors and expansion geographically positions us strongly for future, long-term growth.&quot; Earnings per share rose 66% to 21.2p.  The company said pre-tax profits would continue to grow in 2013 \u2013 analysts predict an increase of about 10% \u2013 but &quot;not at the same rate as 2012, nor at the level we expect in 2014&quot; when it will reap the benefits of the football World Cup. Satterthwaite said: &quot;I know [WPP chief executive] Sir Martin Sorrell talks about the quadrennial effect but really we have a biennial effect in our business.  &quot;World Cups and Olympics happen every other year and the truth is that we will grow faster in even years than in odd years.  &quot;Sports marketing is going to struggle to grow at the rate it did in 2012 but that being said we have a pretty busy year for sport in 2013 with the Ashes and Lions tour, and the Confederations Cup in Brazil.&quot; &quot;We are still aiming to grow the business in 2013 \u2013 we expect strong growth in advertising, health care and PR in particular.&quot;  Chime worked with 15 of the major sponsors at the London Olympics, generating about \u00a330m in revenues in areas such as corporate hospitality and PR activity communicating their clients&apos; involvement in the games. Satterthwaite said he expected the World Cup in Brazil to deliver a similar level of growth in 2014 that the London Olympics generated for the company last year. Today&apos;s results were slightly ahead of analysts&apos; expectations. Looking further ahead, Numis Securities predicted pre-tax profits of \u00a328m in 2013 and said it had &quot;particularly robust prospects&quot; for 2014, making a &quot;very conservative&quot; forecast of \u00a331m. Paul Richards, analyst at Numis Securities, said: &quot;Clearly the group had a tremendous year in 2012, benefiting from the Olympics and the Paralympics, and the key thing that stands out today is the new business they have secured which was the major thing the market was looking for.&quot; \u2022\u00a0To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Because make no mistake, there are people grieving right now, from Salford to Singapore tears are being shed. The Mill, too, is feeling rather emotional after events at Old Trafford, but less so because of the result and more so because of the incredible range of gestures that were on show, from Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s mad pointy finger, to Rio Ferdinand&apos;s end-of-match, in-the-ref&apos;s-face sarcastic applause, to Roy Keane&apos;s attempt at pundit-based comedy. It truly was an incredible night. Anyway, we must move on, and really there is no better way of doing so than seeing who may be going where at some unspecified point in the future. Top of the pops is undoubtedly the news that Andy Carroll is set to return to Liverpool at the end of the season after West Ham decided they do not want to keep the striker beyond his current season-long loan deal. Carroll joined Sam Allardyce&apos;s men last August amid much cockney fanfare but has seen his chances to shine hit by hamstring and knee injuries. He has scored just three times in 15 appearances and, as such, West Ham are no longer interested in converting Carroll&apos;s loan move into a long-term, \u00a317m deal. Cue sighs of relief around Upton Park and a collective groan across Anfield. Instead, West Ham will look to sign Rickie Lambert from Southampton, with the London club confident they can secure the striker for around \u00a36m. Speaking of strikers, Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has decided that he has no intention of joining a Premier League club this summer. The 29-year-old Dutchman has long been linked with a move to England, with Arsenal and Liverpool said to be among his admirers, but Huntelaar is instead giving serious consideration to ending his career at Schalke, who he joined from Milan in 2010. One player who could be heading for the Premier League, however, is Erik Lamela, with Manchester City keen on signing the winger. The 21-year-old, who joined Roma from River Plate in 2011 and has been capped once by Argentina, has apparently been watched by City&apos;s football development executive Patrick Vieira. Elsewhere, Birmingham want to sign the Scotland midfielder Andrew Shinnie from Inverness Caledonian Thistle, while Celtic are interested in signing Liverpool&apos;s 20-year-old striker Michael Ngoo, who has impressed during his current loan deal at Hearts, scoring three goals in eight games for the Edinburgh club. Finally, some potentially harrowing news; Richard Keys is returning to television. Mr &apos;Smash It&apos; is reportedly set to front Al Jazeera&apos;s coverage of the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup. No word yet on whether he&apos;ll be joined by regular sidekick and friend of feminism Andy Gray. That&apos;s it then. I&apos;m off to Wayne Rooney&apos;s house for a spot of tea and toast.

Faced with such a startling statistic, it is easy to imagine the cities of the future grinding to a halt as they struggle to cope with overcrowding, congestion and the provision of basic food, energy and water supplies. Fortunately, there is much that can be done today to avoid such problems in the future. &quot;Smart city&quot; thinking, whereby technology is used to ease urban living, is catching on everywhere. Experimental eco-cities, such as China&apos;s Sino-Singapore Tianjin project or Fujisawa in Japan, tend to dominate our thinking on the subject and they certainly provide valuable insights into the future of sustainable urban design. Sino-Singapore, for instance, has taken a very practical approach to smart thinking. All the technology used there, such as solar-powered heating, has to be affordable and transferrable to other cities if it proves effective. Fujisawa&apos;s innovative funding model \u2013 the project is backed by a consortium of nine companies, led by electronics giant Panasonic \u2013 could inspire other collaborative schemes. However, in Europe, as in other developed world countries, we don&apos;t have the luxury to start from scratch. The challenge is to retrofit our existing cities. And to retrofit them now, not some time in the future. Much of the technology required is already at hand or close to completion. But for these advances to be realised, what business models can we adopt to encourage collaboration across sectors and how can investment be unlocked? Once in place, how will these technological innovations promote health and wellbeing and ease the lives of citizens? These are just some of the questions that will be discussed during a two-hour live Q&amp;A session on 11 March at 1pm-3pm, which is being hosted by Guardian Sustainable Business in association with law firm Bird &amp; Bird, technology giant Cisco and Barclays. The online debate will undoubtedly point out that smart cities need not be science fiction; they can be ready for 2015, not 2050. Tangible examples of technology-driven urban innovation already exist, primarily in three areas: energy, healthcare and transport. For example smart grids, tele-medicine and sensors in public parking facilities. But while individual technologies such as these can deliver individual sustainability, how can all parties work together collaboratively to fully integrate smart thinking in our cities? What role will city residents have to play in this collaborative approach and how can they get involved? For example, can social media be used by citizens to feed into the process of urban design? Developing smart cities is becoming less about creating smart technologies, and more about learning how to use them smartly. We&apos;re smarter than we think, but still not quite smart enough.

The new Triple E ships, which will come into service this summer, will be able to carry 18,000 6.1-metre (20ft) containers, known as TEUs \u2013 three times as many as the biggest container ships 15\u00a0years ago. When US businessman Malcolm McLean invented the idea of carrying goods in metal boxes in the 1950s his first vessel, a converted second world war oil tanker the Ideal X, carried just 58 containers. Today, if all the containers on a Triple E were stacked on top of each other they would touch the stratosphere \u2013 29 miles above the earth. If they were unloaded on to a single train it would need to be 68 miles long. Inside, you could squeeze in 36,000 cars. Because they&apos;re so vast the Triple Es \u2013 which stands for economy of scale, energy efficiency and environmentally improved \u2013 will be able to move goods more cheaply and efficiently than current ships. But, they will be far too big for most of the world&apos;s ports. No port in North or South America is currently able to take the vessels, nor the Panama canal locks \u2013 designed for the last generation of container ships \u2013 which are due to open next year. The Triple Es will just about squeeze through the Suez canal, and will ply only the China to Europe route, bringing in goods and returning with cargoes of scrap metal and plastic waste for recycling \u2013 but mostly empty. Only a handful of European ports, including Felixstowe and Southampton in the UK, are equipped to handle the behemoths. Those that cannot are investing hundreds of millions to make sure they can. The UK is building a \u00a31.5bn port 20 miles east of London&apos;s original ports. London Gateway, which is being bankrolled by Dubai&apos;s DP World, has just installed the first of 24 138-metre high cranes designed specifically to reach up and across the Triple Es&apos; vast deck of containers. London Gateway, which is due to open before the end of the year, is Britain&apos;s biggest construction project after Crossrail, employing 2,500 workers. The government hopes the port will support 36,000 jobs. Andrew Bowen, the project&apos;s director of engineering, said the port will be able to handle seven Triple Es at the same time. &quot;There is very limited capacity for the biggest new ships at Felixstowe and Southampton, and it&apos;s very important that we as a country have the capacity to handle the largest vessels travelling the world,&quot; he said. &quot;If we don&apos;t have the capacity to handle them, it would like if we didn&apos;t have an airport to handle the A380 [superjumbo planes] and you&apos;d have to go to the continent to change planes. &quot;It would be the same for containers, and that extra handling would make goods more expensive for British consumers. And cost UK manufacturers more to ship out.&quot; Since 1990 the UK has slid from the world&apos;s fifth biggest exporter to its 11th \u2013 behind Belgium, Italy and Russia. The UK is ranked 19th in exporters to India, with just 1.5% of the market. The EU recently signed free trade agreements with Colombia, Peru and half a dozen central American countries, it is also in negotiations with China, Canada and Singapore. The result could add about \u20ac275bn (\u00a3237bn) to Europe&apos;s economy \u2013 a boost equal to another Austria joining the EU. As well as triggering the construction of new ports, growing freight traffic is also causing the reshaping of some the world&apos;s most historic ports. Napoleon Bonaparte first recognised Antwerp&apos;s strategic position 80 miles inland in 1811 when he ordered the construction of the Belgian city&apos;s first port. Antwerp, which boasts inland waterway and rail-links across Europe, has been at the centre of global trade ever since. The city has Europe&apos;s second biggest port, but is at risk of falling behind Dutch rival Rotterdam as most of Antwerp docks are unable to accept the last generation of container ships, let alone the Triple Es. The Belgians, however, have a solution. They are digging a very big hole \u2013 1km long by 70 metres wide by 18 metres deep. Among the excavated earth \u2013 enough to fill Wembley stadium eight times over \u2013 workers found the preserved remains of a prehistoric whale. Palaeontologist and archaeologists now work alongside construction workers for two days a week.     The world's largest dock is being constructed in Antwerp, and will enable the Belgium port to accommodate Triple Es. Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters    In 2016, after 53 months of construction, the hole will become the world&apos;s largest lock, and it will enable the biggest ships to enter into all of Antwerp&apos;s docks. The \u20ac340m construction project is central to the EU&apos;s Transport 2050 plan to cope with increasing trade to and from Europe. Philippe Maystadt, president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is financing half of the money, said the lock &quot;will benefit not only the port of Antwerp and Flanders but also Europe&quot;. Some fear all the investment pumped into London Gateway, Antwerp and other ports could have a limited shelf life if ships continue to grow. Maersk Line \u2013 a Danish shipping firm that has ordered 20 Triple Es from South Korean shipbuilder Daewoo \u2013 believes the vessels will be the biggest on the seas for some years to come. The company, which is thought to be basis of Robert Zeuthen&apos;s fictional shipping giant Zeeland in the The Killing, is the world&apos;s biggest shipping company with a fleet of more than 500 vessels. Soren Toft, its vice-president of operations, said: &quot;This is not about adding big ships because we like them, this is about adding capacity for our customers. &quot;Parts of the world can&apos;t accommodate these [triple Es], but we believe these are the right and efficient ships for the Asia to Europe route.&quot; But David Tozer, global manager for container ships at Lloyd&apos;s Register Group, warned that even bigger \u2013 25,000-container capable ships \u2013 are perfectly feasible. &quot;We&apos;ve gone from a maximum of 5,000 containers in 1998 to 18,000 now. The technology is there to carry on getting bigger and bigger. It is absolutely massive business \u2013 almost everything that can be carried is carried in a container. And it&apos;s all about economies of scale.&quot; The next generation of ships, he reckons, may be too big to fit through the Strait of Malacca between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra. They may then have to take the long route from China to Europe \u2013 possibly all the way round Australia. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2013 to correct a typographical error."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/mar/07/cloud-public-sector-government", "sentences": ["In Singapore, the government has contracted suppliers to build a private cloud."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-07T12:38:00Z", "title": "Will all government services take a cloud first approach?", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Cloud"], "article": "The public sector has not been immune to the appeal of cloud computing, with governments keen to accelerate adoption of cloud services. However, while the private and commercial sector has taken to cloud computing more readily, there still exists a somewhat sporadic adoption across the public sector. Introducing a cloud first policy can be an effective way to endorse and encourage the sector to embrace the benefits that cloud computing can bring. Factors that need to be addressed to promote acceptance and bring about simplified adoption include cultural barriers, based around fear, uncertainty, and a lack of information. Governments are stimulating the cloud appetite Governments are taking steps to facilitate implementation and reduce barriers. There is no one favoured approach because the widespread adoption of public cloud for service delivery is not yet at a mature level. In France, the Directorate of Legal and Administrative Information (DILA) has adopted a private cloud approach through the construction of a new data centre for the delivery of services to citizens and administration officers. The work of DILA contributes to transparency in public, economic, and financial affairs and is the country&apos;s first government cloud. In Singapore, the government has contracted suppliers to build a private cloud.\u00a0 In the UK, the G-Cloud programme aims to enable government agencies to deliver services securely and quickly on demand. It also aims to bring about cost savings through the standardisation and sharing of computing resources and applications by providing a framework for procuring accredited services, a public sector network based on standards and a mandated open standards policy. The US government has adopted a cloud first model. In 2010, it introduced this policy to default to cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable and cost-effective cloud option exists. The public sector is increasingly betting on cloud computing An increasingly large number of countries have ambitions to use cloud computing to boost the local economy, with a special focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), often in partnership with the local telecommunications incumbent. The EU stipulated in a recent report its aim to create 3.8m jobs by 2020 via investments in cloud computing. Similarly, in Asia-Pacific governments are encouraging local cloud computing consortiums. The impact of these local public sector initiatives will depend on each country&apos;s local conditions. However, caution should be applied here. There are certainly important macroeconomic, country-level benefits to be had from cloud computing, but governments must be realistic about the changes that will come from it. A new mindset is required for consuming cloud services A cloud computing operating model means that an agency can enjoy potentially increased operational efficiency through paying for consumption rather than capacity. However, the flexibility that cloud brings can often bring with it commercial agreements that have been defined to protect the service provider at the expense of the government agency. A more balanced approach needs to be reached. This is precisely what the EU is trying to achieve, with the ambition to impose a more balanced perspective on cloud responsibilities and liabilities across all cloud contracts. Cloud computing is the enabler Cloud computing is such that it is not an end in itself, rather it is what it enables and facilitates that holds the value. It is this opportunity to redefine \u2013 be it procurement, service management or development processes \u2013 that should be explored by the public sector. For example, the UK&apos;s G-cloud framework has brought in a simplified way of procuring accredited services. There need not be overly complicated procurement processes sitting on top of this. Keeping the down-selection process as simple as it can be will maximise the benefit that a short procurement cycle can bring. As cloud first strategies start to gain some credence, the coming years will likely see more such mandates on agencies as standards are created, security issues addressed, and return on investment (ROI) case studies established in a multitude of projects. As both the maturity of the offerings and the financial desperation of public sector agencies increase, there will be an acceleration of cloud service adoption. This could prove explosive when a point is reached where most new information and communications technology (ICT) procurement gives preference to the cloud services model.

Ottolenghi&apos;s column aims to demystify the &quot;unusual&quot; ingredients he uses in his cooking, such as this recent piece focusing on verjuice and caraway. So if you have an exotic ingredient gathering dust in a cupboard because you don&apos;t know what to do with it, or you&apos;re struggling to track down an essential item for an Ottolenghi recipe, post a plea for help.     Yotam Ottolenghi    His TV series, Ottolenghi&apos;s Mediterranean Feast, is currently showing on Channel 4 on Sunday nights. Feel free to post a question about the first two episodes, on Moroccan and Turkish cuisine, or the forthcoming programmes about Tunisian and Israeli food. Ottolenghi has also published three recipe books, Ottolenghi, Plenty and Jerusalem. If you struggled with any of the recipes, or just want to sing the praises of a great dish, let him know below. Ottolenghi&apos;s Guardian column featured exclusively vegetarian dishes until 2010, so although he is not a vegetarian himself, he is well-placed to answer any questions about vegetarian cooking. He is Israeli-born and lived there for the first 30 years of his life, so has a particular expertise when it comes to Middle Eastern food \u2013 though you can ask away about European and Asian cuisine too. Or maybe you have a question about his delis or restaurant, Nopi.  Finally, Ottolenghi has a master&apos;s degree in philosophy and comparative literature, so feel free to throw in some tricky philosophical questions below the line to keep him on his toes \u2026 How Yotam Ottolenghi answered your questions gentlybenevolent asks: Do you have any thoughts on cheering up swedes and cabbage? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @gentlybenevolent - Caraway seeds, chilli pastes, cumin, coriander seeds, roasted garlic (whole head, squeezed), caramelised onion, dollops of ricotta whisked together with feta and lemon zest \u2013 these are a few options that spring to mind. lv50 says: Just wanted to say &quot;thanks&quot; for the leek fritter recipe in Plenty. It&apos;s now one of our family favourites. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @lv50 - My pleasure. blurvert asks: What would you recommend for a mid-week, post-work meal with a Middle Eastern influence?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @blurvert - try sauteing tons of sliced onions in olive oil with turmeric, coriander seeds, cumin seeds and whole cinnamon sticks. Add rice and tinned chickpeas. Top with water and cook covered on very low heat for 15-20 minutes. Once done, fold in freshly chopped herbs. Sparebulb says: I&apos;m a caterer and I need some vegetarian soup recipes that could be made ahead and would keep warm for up to four hours of service. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Sparebulb - Thank you. I always find that adding a herby paste to a soup that sat a while adds a necessary freshness. I&apos;d make chickpea or butterbean (or both) soup with diced carrots, harissa, coriander seeds, thyme and garlic. Just before serving I&apos;d swirl on top blitzed up coriander mixed with olive oil and lemon zest. Silky1 asks: Could you recommend any vegetarian dishes that could really make the most of za&apos;atar? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Silky1 - Marinate a selection of root veg \u2013 say carrots, turnips, sweet potatoes, potatoes \u2013 in olive oil, crushed garlic and lots of za&apos;atar and roast in a hot oven. In the summer za&apos;atar is the best thing you can add to a simple chopped salad of tomatoes, cucumbers and radishes. Juneowl asks:  If you could use a time machine to bring four people to dinner and prepare a meal for them, who would you invite? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Juneowl - that&apos;s a hard one. Perhaps I&apos;d try to get Jesus, Mohammad and Moses to sit together and sort out our problem. twistedtwister asks: What are your thoughts on meat &apos;politics&apos; eg frequency of eating it versus land required for animal protein? And do you have an opinion on the horse meat &apos;scandal&apos;?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @twistedtwister - People should eat what they like. That&apos;s my basic conviction. However, it is hard to justify the amount of meat and fish we consume these days. The world&apos;s population just cannot afford to eat meat three times a day anymore.In my mind, if you are not a vegetarian, the best thing you can do for the planet and for yourself is eat less meat and fish. Instead of a steak have meatballs with lots of other stuff added to them. Have fewer meals with meat and less meat per meal. Consider making meat or fish something reserved for special occasions, like dinner or the weekend. rackham10 asks: Why do you use so much salt in your cooking? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @rackham10 - must raise my hand up, I do love salt. It just brings out all the other flavours. Still, I will keep an eye and see where, if possible, we can reduce. julieoakley says: I just wanted to write to say how much I love, love, love your recipes \u2026 and you are the only person (in your book Jerusalem) who has shown me how to get chickpeas soft enough to make hummus without boiling them for hours and hours. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @julieoakley - thanks so much. I love hearing this and even blush a little. John Watters asks: What is the secret to the perfect falafel? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @John Watters - Number one secret, which isn&apos;t really a secret: fry it and eat it. Never let is stand. The chickpeas are soaked, not cooked, before being ground, ideally in a meat grinder, or, if using a food processor, don&apos;t overwork. The rest is almost immaterial. Salt, spices, that&apos;s it. EllaEllaEllaAA asks: If you were asked to prepare a classic British plate of food, what would you prepare and why? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @EllaEllaEllaAA - Some great British creations are the Yorkshire pudding, which I can have anytime, anywhere, a good trifle and a rich fish pie. These are immortal classics that I love. Rachaelworld asks: I have difficulty getting the timing right when using fresh herbs and spices. Are there &quot;rules of thumb&quot; that you use, and do they vary depending on the ingredient?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Rachaelworld - My trick is adding the aromatic (ginger, garlic, herb, grated citrus etc) both at the beginning and a small amount at the end of the cooking. This way you get the mellow, cooked aroma in the background and the more punchy immediate flavour in the foreground. Squeakyball says: I just wanted to say thank you for Jerusalem (the book not the city). For Christmas last year we ignored tradition and instead had some 14 dishes all from your book.  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Squeakyball - pleasure. Well done for being brave and straying away from tradition once. lowtide55 asks: What is your favourite vegan dish? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @lowtide55 - mejadra! I love rice and lentils with tons of spices and fried onion. Though I often spoil its vegan-ness with a dollop of yoghurt on top. Sorry.... JamieLondon89 asks: If you only had 30 mins to prepare and cook a quality dish, what would it be? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @JamieLondon89 - Asian noodles (soba or udon), simmering away, at the same time I saut\u00e9 some mushrooms in veg oil. Once cooked I add rice vinegar, sugar, lime juice, ginger and salt. Remove from the heat and pour over the cooked and drained noodles. Leave to cool down a little before adding picked coriander, basil, little bit of sesame oil and sesame seeds. FreddyP asks: Are there any good non-virgin olive oils you can recommend for day-to-day cooking? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @FreddyP - I wouldn&apos;t be a purist when it comes to olive oil. Okay, for a good dressing I&apos;d spend a little more but for everyday cooking you can use cheaper varieties. wmffra asks: What would be your ultimate dinner party three course? Also, Heraclitus said that &apos;One can not step twice in the same river&apos;, why is that exactly? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @wmffra - this main course you can prepare in advance and just stick in the oven when ready: http://scrapbook.channel4.com/bookmarkBar/50aa1acfe4b09b08528a6da7 Serve it with bread and a lemony green salad.For a starter go for some fresh figs (when in season), serve with a young goat&apos;s cheese.The 3rd time you step in the river you may drown I suppose. niamhie asks: Parsnips - help please! I can&apos;t get on with their cloying sweetness. Is there something that will make them a bit less nauseating? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @niamhie - why eat them then? But if you insist, cut into batons and blanch them until soft. Dress immediately with lemon juice, a little vinegar, chives, olive oil and salt and pepper. When cool, fold in feta chunks and rocket and serve. nabisco asks: Was that wasabi-in-the-guacamole inspired by Dr Steve Brule? Have you tried making sushi with peaches? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @nabisco - no to both, I&apos;m afraid. MrSnickers asks: I have a severe intolerance to wheat and when it comes to your recipes that feature freekeh and bulghur etc, I&apos;m generally stuck with what to use as a substitute. Any suggestions and/or general advice would be much appreciated! Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @MrSnickers - first, thank you! Very often you can replace wheat with rice or barley. If you can have it, you may want to try faro, which is low in gluten. Quinoa is fantastic too. Just adjust the cooking times. Good luck! farofa asks: What is the secret of good melawach? And, knowing it is buttery, why do Yeminis live so long?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @farofa - I don&apos;t think I know the secret. Sorry.I don&apos;t think longevity has got much to do with diet, though. It is much more about a healthy mind. LondonRevisited asks: Do you know why Rick Stein can&apos;t make a program about foreign cuisine without saying &quot;It&apos;s so much better than how we cook it in Britain&quot;, or some other xenocentric cliche about the food he encounters? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @LondonRevisited - I am not sure. I am inclined to say something that may sound diplomatic but I truly believe in. There are good cooks and crap cooks everywhere. There isn&apos;t such a thing as bad cuisine. Harrynilsson asks: What is the secret to making the best hummus? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @harrynilsson - hah! Smooth smooth smooth chickpea paste. Enough tahini paste, lemon juice and salt. No oil in the actual hummus mix. Lancuna asks: What is your go-to, easy pasta dish that we can replicate on lazy days? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Lancuna - I cook a basic tomato sauce (tomatoes, onions, celery carrots, thyme, olive oil) and add a tin or two of smoked oysters, with their oil. Can&apos;t beat that one. Meepmeep asks: Which is the best vegetable? I say onion, my girlfriend says tomato, but we both suspect it might be the aubergine. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @meepmeep - gosh, how do I answer that? Kholrabi? ;) IamMichieBoo asks: I was curious how you came to make your Tofu-fa dessert at Nopi, as it is incredibly similar to the beancurd custards that we have in Singapore. Were you inspired by a trip out to South East Asia? Are there other South East Asian dishes that you&apos;d like to replicate or adapt for Nopi? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @iamMichieBoo - definitely. The tofu-fa was inspired by a trip to Malaysia. Scully, our head chef, is of Malaysian origin and includes many chilli pastes and regional pickles. Toruhaslostacat asks: Is falafel a social construct or does it exist in nature? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @toruhaslostacat - they grow on trees. Gingerinlondon says: You inspire me to be better cook; to be a better person (you are so humble and so genuine with the people you have visited on your tv programme) and to travel more extensively. Please keep doing what you are doing - you have such integrity. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @gingerinlondon - thanks so much! BadUsername asks: Where do you get your great shirts? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @BadUsername - love your question. Paul Smith, Vivienne Westwood, Gant, Ralph Lauren. Pricey, I know, but hey, I&apos;m gay. Vespermartini asks: What is it that drives / motivates you and the seemingly endless enthusiasm and passion for what you do and what would your one piece of key advice be to someone who would like to emulate your success? Also, as you have covered the Eastern Mediterranean is there any chance of you heading over to the West and exploring the cuisine and working the Yotam magic?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @vespermartini - Thank you. I am constantly inspired by the people who work with me at Ottolenghi and NOPI. They come from all over the world and always have something new to offer. Traveling is also a constant source of inspiration. Westward - def one day. Samanthat123 asks: What&apos;s your favourite way of making sweet potato? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @samanthat123 - thinly sliced and fried, sprinkled with salt. Susannah_M asks: Do herbs and spices go stale over time? Is it better to make your own blends (eg za&apos;ater), pestle &amp; mortar vs machinery. I notice you use many fresh herbs. What are your thoughts on dried herbs and things like frozen garlic/ginger cubes?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Susannah_M - ta. You should always smell your spices. Once they have lost their aroma there&apos;s no way back. I say buy ground spices if you haven&apos;t got much time, or grind your own if you can. Dried herbs are good substitutes to fresh only in some occasion but not often. Chloemae asks: Do you have any recipes for Middle Eastern sweets, as an idea to give as presents at Easter? Also, I&apos;m looking for a recipe for a leg of lamb.  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Chloemae - For sweets I really recommend ma&apos;amul. There are recipes online and in our book Jerusalem. This lamb dish fits the bill, I believe: http://scrapbook.channel4.com/bookmarkBar/50a0f9ace4b09b085289c048 BodenVictim asks: Do you have any tips for the perfect muhammara? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @BodenVictim - Thanks. Funny, muhammara is also one of my favourites and I never managed to get it quite right. I think it has a lot (!) to do with the quality of the walnuts. I&apos;d try the recipe when walnuts are fresh, during the autumn. Thewhisperingeye asks: I ate at Nopi the other day and it was fantastic - how do you get the Kale side dish so full of flavour? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @thewhisperingeye - Thank you! The kale is cooked with lots of good olive oil, julienned ginger and finished with lemon juice. Judy63 says: I just wanted to thank you for what you do with vegetables Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @judy63 - thank you. peeledapples asks: Do you have any recommendations on how to get the best out of celeriac?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @peeledapples - my favourite is raw celeriac. Cut into matchstick size and dress with lemon juice (of course), chopped capers, crushed garlic, a little mustard, olive oil, chopped chive and chopped tarragon. DimSumYum asks: London/Jerusalem excluded, is there a town/region that you would choose to live for it&apos;s cuisine? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @DimSumYum - a few. San Francisco, Beirut, Melbourne, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur. Katchuri asks: I&apos;m intolerant of lettuce (possibly the stupidest food intolerance I&apos;ve ever heard of, but sadly true) and have recently discovered I can eat things like pak choi. Any ideas for livening up pak choi etc? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @katchuri - At least you can eat bread! Treat Pak Choi it as you would spinach or chard. Cook, drain well and blitz with eggs, breadcrumbs and feta to make fried patties. Or shred finely (raw) and male a slaw using other shredded veg (cabbage, beet), lime juice, veg oil, sesame oil, a bit of maple syrup. lantos csenge asks: Do you have any secret tips about what kind of dishes should we add pomegranate molasses; and preserved lemons? Thank you. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @lantos csenge - molasses - marinade for chicken, salad dressings, dressings for legumes such as butterbeans, drizzle over crushed sweet potato.Preserved lemons - all stews, spicy sauces, when making mayo. Bellagiornata asks: l managed to get some sumac &amp; some pomegrante sauce, how best could I put these ingrediants to good use with what type of meat? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Bellagiornata - mix them together and marinate lamb cutlets, or chicken, or rabbit. Use more later to freshly drizzle once cooked. Squashy asks: One of my favourite items from your shops is the savoury muffin (basil, pine nuts, cherry toms, etc) but I can&apos;t find the recipe anywhere. Care to share? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Squashy - would love to! But it ain&apos;t gonna happen... ;-) langley_becky asks: Whenever I&apos;ve made falafel they&apos;ve always fallen apart during cooking. Does the method above prevent this? Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @langley_becky - it&apos;s tricky. Try pressing well to compact. You&apos;d also need to add a little flour and water. Make sure the oil isn&apos;t too hot or it will blow them away. LaCoccinelle says: I&apos;ve been buying your books for presents for the past few years and introducing you to my friends and family. Everyone loves them, thanks from all of us. My favourite recipe is butternut squash, red onion, tahini and za&apos;atar. Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @LaCoccinelle - thanks for sharing! Zordkhan asks: All my family and friends have fallen for chocolate krantz cake. What does krantz mean?  Yotam Ottolenghi responds:  @Zordkhan - I am glad you say that. Quite a few people are too intimidated to try. I think, but not sure, that krantz is similar to crunch. The nutty mix in some variation is pretty crunchy. SheikRhatElAnrhol says: I have bought four of your books and took Jerusalem to Toronto for my sister in law who loves it.

He asserts as a &quot;fact&quot; that the EU is &quot;the least competitive trading bloc in the world&quot;, yet also tells us that the UK has a trade deficit with the rest of the EU of \u00a355.7bn. If these countries, despite being so uncompetitive, have managed to export so much more to the UK\u00a0than\u00a0we have exported to them, what does that tell us about the UK&apos;s competitiveness? Presumably, it means\u00a0that the UK is even more uncompetitive than &quot;the least competitive trading bloc in the world&quot;. If this is correct, the only advantage in leaving the EU would be that we could then shelter our inefficient domestic producers by imposing import restrictions against our former EU partners. However, quite apart from any retaliation that this might provoke, it is generally accepted that import restrictions, by reducing competitive pressure, tend to reduce the efficiency of domestic industries. Probably not the outcome Smith wants. The underlying and fundamental problem with Smith&apos;s analysis is its implicit assumption that the competitiveness of a nation is analogous to the competitiveness of a corporation or an industry. The fallacy in this regrettably common approach has been exposed with wonderful clarity in many writings by Nobel laureate Professor Paul Krugman. Just type Krugman national competitiveness into your web browser.Geoffrey RenshawUniversity of Warwick \u2022 The population of the world is somewhat over 7 billion. Over 4 billion live in Asia, but only 500 million in the EU \u2013 about 7% of the world&apos;s population. If we are collectively achieving 19% of global GDP, then that is pretty good. One reason why Asia and some other parts of the world now take an increasing share of GDP is that they are catching up with Europe which experienced, in the\u00a0main, its industrial and commercial revolution in the 19th and early 20th century. Most people would consider it a good thing that more of the people in those parts of the world were being lifted out of poverty. This, of course, entails them having a larger (and fairer) share of global output. After all, in 1905 nearly 100% of cars would have been owned by the upper class. These days they would only own a tiny percentage\u00a0of the total. No one would seriously consider this as a premise for arguing that the upper class had lost virtually all of its money and power though. Kevin CunnaneNorwich \u2022 City broker and fund manager Terry Smith informs us that membership of the EU damages competitiveness because &quot;we are forced to import the labour practices and regulations&quot; of Europe (if only this were completely true), and recommends aligning ourselves with Singapore and the US. Europe has given British workers the right to four weeks&apos; paid holiday each year. In Singapore, the entitlement starts at seven days and rises to 14, while in the US there is no right to paid holiday. As with David Cameron&apos;s demand for repatriation of powers over employment rights so that they can be reduced, these claims by a member of the rich 1% are an attack on the 99%.Christopher ClaytonWaverton, Cheshire"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/09/bali-property-frenzy-islanders-boom", "sentences": ["But there is also a steady stream of buyers from Australia, France and the UK, and Asian expats from Singapore and Hong Kong, who are keeping the market afloat."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-09T20:02:33Z", "title": "In Bali, rich foreigners are sparking a property frenzy, but who benefits?", "tags": ["Bali", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "They teeter along in stilettos and backless dresses, their partners in partially open buttondown shirts, and duck into restaurants serving champagne, truffles and peppercorn steaks. Afterwards, these crowds of upmarket Indonesians and expats will head to any number of bars along the bustling artery of this once sleepy seaside village of Seminyak, a now vibrant town on the island of Bali that 10 years ago was lined by rice paddy fields and populated with farmers. All along Jalan Laksmana, Seminyak&apos;s main thoroughfare, glass-fronted stores sell high-end surfer-inspired chic, such as \u00a3125 bikinis and organic wheatgrass shots, while restaurants cater to the many bule \u2013 foreigners \u2013 by offering Japanese, Italian and fusion Indonesian cuisine at candlelit tables with Ibiza-like club music on the sound system. Firms with names like Exotiq Property and Elite Havens detail beachfront villas running at \u00a31.5m and higher, showcasing homes close to &quot;the action&quot; \u2013 Bali&apos;s famous hangouts like Ku De Ta and Potato Head, where languages overheard can range from French to Russian to Chinese. Bali has long been famous as a playground for both the rich and the not-so-rich, easily providing both villas and backpacker hostels so that visitors can enjoy its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters whatever their budget. But now this island of 4 million is finding another kind of fame \u2013 as a major investment opportunity for the luxury property market. Luxury property prices in 2012 jumped in Indonesia by more than anywhere else in the world, according to research by Knight Frank. The capital, Jakarta, saw an astonishing increase of 38% in luxury property prices from 2011, and Bali came in a respectable second at 20%, tying with Dubai. While Monaco may still be the world&apos;s most expensive place to buy a residential property\u2013 homes there can cost up to $5,920 (\u00a33,960) per square foot \u2013 if Indonesia keeps up this pace, that could soon change. There are now more millionaires in Asia than anywhere else in the world, and in Indonesia, whose booming economy could surpass the UK&apos;s to become the world&apos;s seventh-largest by 2030, individuals&apos; net worth has shot up 7% year on year. What does that mean? In simple terms, says Zoe Rice of property firm Elite Havens&apos; flagship Seminyak office \u2013 a low-slung, white-and-blue, beachhouse-themed property that looks as though it should be facing the Indian ocean rather than the village&apos;s busy square \u2013 property investment in Indonesia is simply &quot;better value than keeping money in the bank&quot;. Much of the growth underpinning Bali&apos;s healthy property market comes from domestic buyers, notably the wealthy players of Surabaya and Jakarta, says Rice. But there is also a steady stream of buyers from Australia, France and the UK, and Asian expats from Singapore and Hong Kong, who are keeping the market afloat. And they&apos;re not just purchasing second or third holiday homes: vacant land is the number-one choice for Indonesians, followed by hotels, condo-hotels and private villas. For foreign buyers, purchases are of homes and villas for full-time residential use; a market report to be released this week by Elite Havens cites Bali&apos;s high tourist arrivals, healthy economy and shifting of government debt to investment grade as reasons why the island is &quot;resilien[t] and [a] safe haven for investors in these globally turbulent times&quot;. &quot;Capital appreciation has been substantial [in Bali] in the past decade,&quot; says Rice. &quot;There&apos;s been a dramatic increase in Seminyak, where land prices have almost tripled in the last two years because demand is so high and supply so low.&quot; All this has not been lost on local people, many of whom have taken to nicknaming the island kampung bule \u2013 &quot;whitey town&quot; \u2013 because of the sea of foreigners swarming Bali&apos;s streets and beaches. &quot;Housing in Bali is expensive now because many bule live in their own private villas, and they buy with dollars and pay dollar prices,&quot; says 31-year-old Budi Susila, a taxi driver who spends his days transporting foreigners around the island. &quot;That makes locals want to sell their land to bule, which makes more bule interested in moving here, which means that every year we lose more rice paddies and more greenery. The government gives permits very easily for new construction because they get money in their pocket.&quot; Expat hotspot Seminyak has just lost its last rice paddy, says Rice, who claims that the central road that cuts through Legian and up to Seminyak was &quot;lined left and right&quot; with them a decade ago. Now the roads are choked with taxis, 4x4s and motorbikes manned by tanned blonds with surfboards in tow, who snake along many of the busiest areas in southern Bali in traffic so heavy that a 30-minute drive can easily turn into a two-hour one. Non-beachfront land around the most sought-after areas, including Seminyak and Petitenget, is now worth 2.5bn rupiah per 100 square metres \u2013 \u00a3171,000 \u2013 with prices decreasing the further north and inland one travels, Rice says. But much of the attraction of buying land or property in Bali is being close to the action: Seminyak serves as the de facto centre of Bali&apos;s expat beachfront scene, as it is home to world-class restaurants, clubs and bars, where the rich and beautiful can chill out with bottles of champagne over views of Bali&apos;s famous sunsets. But even in Ubud, where organic markets and yoga studios rub shoulders with art galleries in what is deemed Bali&apos;s northern &quot;cultural centre&quot;, land prices increased some 55% in 2012, according to research by Elite Havens. In Jakarta, which saw a 38% jump in its residential luxury market prices last year, the story is a little different. There, buyers are investing primarily in flats in the central business district in projects that developers are calling &quot;critical housing&quot; \u2013 prime property in an overcrowded metropolis of 12 million, says Knight Frank&apos;s Hasan Pamudji. &quot;The economy in Indonesia has been growing roughly 6% every year for the last few years, so there are more rich people in Indonesia now than ever,&quot; he says. &quot;But middle and lower incomes have increased as well, which has increased the demand for property.&quot; Although the city is home to extravagant, multimillion-dollar mansions lined by barbed-wire fences, it is flats, rather than houses, that are the new property of choice for those buying property in Jakarta because &quot;they offer security, safety and easy transportation&quot;, says Pamudji. &quot;Traffic congestion in Jakarta is very bad, so some buy condos close to their work or business, which saves them having to commute every day from the suburbs or further away.&quot; Often these condos are the first investment for young couples or upcoming wealthy individuals, he adds, with the average price in downtown&apos;s &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; retailing at 30m rupiah \u2013 \u00a32,050 \u2013 per square metre. Back in Bali, development can be seen pretty much everywhere along the southern coast, with old buildings bulldozed to make way for new commercial properties, among them glittering cafes and restaurant ventures to cater to the ever-burgeoning market of wealthy clientele. In the upmarket beachfront Canggu area, Echo Beach is now home to an InterContinental hotel and the Sea Sentosa project, a resort that calls itself &quot;the benchmark for unparalleled luxury&quot;, while a Sunset Road extension is planned to link the capital, Denpasar, with Bali&apos;s more western beaches. But there has been so much development that the local government has recently placed a moratorium along the most congested beachfront areas and is encouraging growth in the island&apos;s more remote locations instead. Even there, however, investment can prove tricky, says Australian investment banker Richard Jenkins, who moved to Bali three years ago from northern Australia with his wife and two young children. Having bought a clifftop plot of land in Uluwatu, a windswept, still undeveloped area on the island&apos;s most southern tip, the Jenkinses planned to build their own house \u2013 but the permits were never forthcoming. The family now want to move to a \u00a31m property in Seminyak with three villas that they plan to renovate, turning two into holiday rentals. &quot;This is a good place to invest, definitely,&quot; says Jenkins. &quot;There aren&apos;t that many places to say that about in the western world. But while it is a positive real estate market, I do get the impression of a looming glut: there&apos;s just so much building here going on, and it&apos;s all for the tourist market.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/09/formula-one-2013-double-drs", "sentences": ["Eddie&apos;s going to do what Eddie does.&apos; 2013 calendar 17 Mar  Australia Albert Park 24 Mar  Malaysia Sepang 14 Apr  China Shanghai* 21 Apr Bahrain Sakhir 12 May  Spain Circuit de Catalunya* 26 May  Monaco Monte Carlo 9 Jun  Canada Circuit Gilles Villeneuve* 30 Jun  Britain Silverstone* 7 Jul  Germany N\u00fcrburgring 28 Jul Hungary Hungaroring 25 Aug  Belgium Spa-Francorchamps* 8 Sep  Italy Monza* 22 Sep  Singapore Marina Bay 6 Oct  Korea Yeongam 13 Oct Japan Suzuka* 27 Oct India Buddh* 3 Nov  Abu Dhabi Yas Marina 17 Nov  United States Austin 24 Nov Brazil Interlagos* *live on BBC1."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-09T22:00:03Z", "title": "Formula One gets a nose job and double DRS is dead for 2013 season", "tags": ["Formula One 2013", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "1. NOSE JOBS Formula One, vain? Surely not, yet having an aesthetically pleasing appearance is clearly a priority this season after all those\u00a0cruel snipes at the raised noses of 2012&apos;s four-wheeled missiles. To cover up that oh-so horrible stepped nose cone, Formula One&apos;s engineers have now come up with something called a &quot;vanity panel&quot; to conceal the offending area. This creates a nice smooth look but does little to improve the air flow. Next up, Botox bumpers anyone? 2. DOUBLE DRS RIP DRS alone was not enough for Mercedes or Red Bull last season and they came up with Double DRS. Too clever by far, clearly \u2013 it&apos;s been banned for 2013. However, passive drag-reduction systems (they get going once a certain speed is achieved, not by the flick of a switch) are allowed. Plus, it is being limited to designated DRS zones in all sessions, ruling out its use at any point during practice and qualifying. 3. GETTING HEAVIER Pirelli has changed the structure of this season&apos;s tyres, making them 2kg heavier. This means each car&apos;s minimum weight limit has been increased to 640kg. Which in turn means a slide-rule job is required to get the weight distribution right. The\u00a0minimum figures are now 292kg:343kg front to rear. With tyre compounds softer, Pirelli reckons they will warm up quicker and improve grip by 3%, allowing drivers to turn into corners a fraction later and so go faster. 4. Q1 CHANGE The HRT team are no more, so qualifying has been tweaked to accommodate fewer cars on the grid. Last season, seven cars were cut to run in Q2; this season six are dispatched in Q1, which means two midfield drivers will go out instead of one. That leaves 16 drivers to jostle for position in Q2, with 10 going through for the 10-minute Q3 harum-scarum. 5.

So too will the evening ritual of spreading out a plastic sheet over a bed to turn it into a dining table. Food will no longer be prepared in a tiny kitchen crammed with spotless tin utensils. The four toothbrushes \u2013 once five \u2013 will no longer be stored in a battered plastic holder outside the washroom. Thousands of families move to better accommodation every day in Delhi. A marginally lesser number slip into greater poverty. And so India moves, incrementally but seemingly ineluctably, towards prosperity. But the move that will take these two young men and their parents from a two-room basement to a spacious &quot;middle-income&quot; government-built apartment with running water and continuous power is far from ordinary. Nor has it much to do with a new &quot;India Shining&quot;. The new home is a gift from the local authorities and, in the cold language of bureaucrats, described as &quot;compensation&quot; for the death of the young woman, their daughter and sister, who died of injuries sustained during a brutal gang rape by six men three months ago this week. The incident prompted a global outcry, weeks of protests in India and calls for a wide-ranging legal and policing reform. It led to a fierce debate on the wave of sexual violence to women in India and the social attitudes that some say are responsible. On Monday, the principal accused in the rape case, Ram Singh, 33, was found hanged in Delhi&apos;s Tihar prison. An inquiry has been launched into what India&apos;s minister for home affairs admitted was a &quot;serious security lapse&quot;. The victim&apos;s eldest brother, 20, said the family was disappointed the man had been able to chose the time of his own death. Singh was on trial with five others at a specially established fast-track court in Delhi and faced the death sentence. In an interview with the Guardian, the 23-year-old victim&apos;s father remembered the moment when a policeman rang him, at about 10pm on a cold December evening, to tell him there had been an &quot;accident&quot; and that he would find his daughter at a hospital 10 miles across the city from his home in the scruffy outlying suburb of Dwarka. A friend with a motorbike took him through Delhi&apos;s busy traffic. &quot;She was lying on a stretcher, covered by a green blanket,&quot; he said. The family have not been identified in the Indian press due to strict local laws. &quot;I thought she was unconscious but when I laid my hand on her forehead she opened her eyes. She was crying. I told her: &apos;It&apos;ll be alright, beta [child]&apos;.&quot; Hours later came bad news. &quot;I was waiting outside the operating theatre. A doctor came out. He said she would probably not last more than a few hours, certainly more than a day or so,&quot; the father said. But the girl held on much longer, twice giving a crucial statement to investigators. On 25 December, she closed her eyes for the last time. &quot;During the evening, maybe 9pm, she saw me standing outside the intensive care unit. &quot;She turned to look at me and gestured for me to come. She asked me if I had eaten. I said yes. Then she said: &apos;Dad, go to sleep, you must be tired.&apos; I patted her head. She said: &apos;You should get some sleep.&apos; &quot;She took my hand and kissed it. That moment hurts me more every time I think about it. She never opened her eyes again.&quot; His daughter died days later, in a clinic in Singapore where she and the family had been flown by the Indian government for specialised treatment. Unlike many parents in India, where sons are usually favoured, the family had spared nothing for their daughter. A first son had died days after being born and the new child was so welcome &quot;we did not care if it was a boy or a girl as long as it survived,&quot; the father said. She was born in Delhi. Her father had moved to the city from his village in a remote part of the poor, lawless northern state of Uttar Pradesh. He left, reluctantly, his patch of inherited land too small to provide for a family. &quot;I had no choice. I had to move to the city to have a chance of a better life,&quot; he said. He worked in factories and, in recent years, as a loader at Delhi&apos;s domestic airport, working double eight-hour shifts unloading planes from places he could never visit to bring home 200 rupees (\u00a32.50) every day. With no savings, he sold part of his land and mortgaged the rest to raise the 45,000 rupees (\u00a3600) annual fee for his daughter&apos;s training as a physiotherapist at a college in the northern city of Dehradun. The young woman worked in call centres to cover the 50,000 rupees (\u00a3660) living expenses. The family hoped that her earnings would eventually be enough to pay for the college fees of her two younger brothers and perhaps a better life. In their small home, stifling in the 45C heat of the Delhi summer, freezing in the chill winters, the young woman had a bedroom to herself, to sleep and, above all, to study. The rest of the family slept next door in the only other room. She covered a wall in notes and posters \u2013 not of Bollywood stars as many Indian teenagers would have done \u2013 but of formulae and diagrams culled from her science text books. &quot;I read somewhere that pulling yourself out of poverty means working like a horse and living like a saint. That is what I have always done. That is what my children have been taught to do. That is what my daughter did,&quot; her father said. In death, she has transformed her family&apos;s life. Not only are they moving to a new home, of a size and standard they could never have been able to afford, but three separate state governments have made payments worth \u00a350,000. Previously, the family&apos;s entire savings never amounted to more than a the equivalent of \u00a3100. Her 18-year-old brother has been given a coveted job in a subsidiary of Indian railways. The family have not been attending the trial. &quot;What would I do if I saw them? I&apos;d want to kill them but I am helpless,&quot; the father said. The men now facing the death penalty for the assault that took place in a moving bus and the brother said on Monday the suicide of the alleged ringleader should change nothing. A juvenile also detained for his role in the attack should be hanged, too, he added. &quot;I have faith in the government. Every citizen should trust the government of his country to see that justice is done,&quot; the father explained. He and his wife chose their new home close to where they have lived for decades and where their children grew up. Only a few days ago, they packed her clothes and books away. &quot;I console myself that she was a good soul, set free in death,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/14/john-railton-obituary", "sentences": ["With fellow pianist, Kate Elmitt, he formed a professional three-handed piano partnership, giving recitals in London, Australia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-14T16:33:49Z", "title": "John Railton obituary", "tags": ["Classical music", "Music", "Teaching", "Royal Academy of Music"], "article": "My friend and colleague John Railton, who has died aged 83, was an extraordinary musician, composer, conductor and teacher. He wanted musicians to perform beyond their comfort zones, believed profoundly in everyone&apos;s ability and engaged with individuals, groups and communities throughout Britain and overseas, particularly enjoying working with young musicians. He was born in Streatham, south London, and educated at Battersea grammar school and Cranleigh school, Surrey. He studied organ and piano at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1947 he joined the London Bach Society and for many years assisted Paul Steinitz, its founder, as rehearsal pianist and assistant conductor. He took a teaching post at Ealing grammar school, where his choirs became much in demand by the BBC Symphony Chorus and Orchestra; they performed music outside the normal scope of secondary schools with conductors such as Charles Mackerras, Antal Dor\u00e1ti, Colin Davis, Constantin Silvestri and Pierre Boulez. In his mid-30s he lost his left arm to cancer, but this did not affect his work at Ealing, where he steadfastly refused to see himself as disabled. For 21 years he conducted the Ernest Read Music Association&apos;s Christmas concerts at the Royal Albert Hall and the Royal Festival Hall. As a music adviser in Hertfordshire he established the Hertfordshire County Youth Choir and Orpheus Youth Choir and in Hitchin he formed the North Herts Guild of Singers and the Orpheus Choir. With fellow pianist, Kate Elmitt, he formed a professional three-handed piano partnership, giving recitals in London, Australia and Singapore. In his last years in the West Country he taught at Dartington College of Arts, directed the Dartington Community Choir, taught adult music appreciation groups and worked with the East Cornwall Bach festival, the Exeter University Singers and the Exeter Chamber Choir. He founded and directed the Devon Guild of Singers and Players and was organist and choirmaster at St Andrew&apos;s Church, Ashburton. Of the many pieces he transcribed for one hand, the Bach violin Chaconne was his favourite. In 1959 he founded the Ealing Youth Orchestra, which has produced many professional musicians. To mark his 80th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the orchestra, he conducted two performances of the Verdi Requiem, giving these young musicians their first opportunity to accompany a major sacred choral work. He became a fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in 1968 and was appointed MBE in 2012. He married and divorced twice and had three sons with his first wife, Kathleen, and two sons and a daughter with his second wife, Elizabeth.

That, at least, is the vibrant impression created by Tash Aw&apos;s third novel, set in a frenetic megacity of 20 million people, where fortunes are made and lost with vertiginous speed against the highrise Pudong skyline. &quot;When you&apos;re in Shanghai, you feel an energy so blinding that you get swept up,&quot; Aw says. &quot;It&apos;s only when you leave that it feels unreal.&quot; Five Star Billionaire depicts the Chinese dream in a snakes-and-ladders universe of opportunity and ruin, through the eyes of Chinese Malaysians \u2013 from tycoons to factory girls \u2013 trying their luck in the new China. For Aw, whose own ancestors made the reverse journey out of southern China to Malaya, and who moved to England as a student in\u00a0the early 1990s, this novel is about the people he grew up with, and is his &quot;most personal&quot; book. His 2005 debut, The Harmony Silk Factory, set in 1940s British Malaya on the brink of Japanese invasion, won the Costa (Whitbread) first novel award and a Commonwealth Writers prize. It was on various longlists, including the Man Booker and the International Impac Dublin prize, and has been translated into more than 20 languages. The Indonesian setting of his second novel, Map of the Invisible World, published four years later, marked Aw, now 41, as part of a rising generation of south-east-Asian-born writers who are remapping the region with little heed to existing national frontiers. Aw, who has a kinship with Tan Twan Eng, author of the Booker-shortlisted The Garden of Evening Mists, casts one\u00a0eye on the past in a place whose full-throttle growth leaves scant time for the backward glance. &quot;I&apos;m not naturally nostalgic for a cosy, bygone era,&quot; he says, &quot;but a lot of my work is concerned with what we give up in the march forwards.&quot; He lives alone in a basement flat near Old Street in east London, with a tiny garden in which he grows bamboo and banana palms. Bashful about being there for 12 years, he murmurs: &quot;There&apos;s a lack of momentum.&quot; He visits Asia &quot;several times a year&quot;, and\u00a0can reel off the merits of its cities and street food from Bali to Penang. Compared with Bangkok, Manila and Jakarta, he says, &quot;Shanghai is the only big city where you can go for a stroll. It&apos;s slower and very seductive, with real soul and romance.&quot; A Malaysian national, and now teaching in Singapore for part of the year, he launched his new novel in the city-state last month, and in Malaysia, both of which he sees as &quot;home territory&quot;. Twenty years ago, he says, &quot;people of my generation would gravitate towards the great cities of the west,&quot; but he began travelling to China a decade ago because he &quot;was struck that more and more people seeking a better life abroad seemed to be heading to China&quot;. The new novel was sparked by some &quot;weird coincidences&quot;, he says. &quot;I kept bumping into people who knew people who knew me from childhood. I&apos;d hear Malaysian accents across a restaurant, then actively search them out.&quot; Glancing connections emerge between five main characters, including a &quot;philanthropist&quot; who writes self-help books, and a spa receptionist who devours them. There is a pop idol who disgraced himself in a brawl, a political radical turned businesswoman and a\u00a0real estate dealer who burns out, his own desires subordinate to crushing family duty. As Aw sees it, &quot;his secure place comes at a price. One sees that a\u00a0lot in Asia.&quot; The chapter headings, such as &quot;Move to Where the Money Is&quot;, borrow from Chengyu \u2013 Chinese idioms of parental advice \u2013 that have been hijacked within contemporary culture to serve a ruthless self-advancement. He read over people&apos;s shoulders on the Shanghai Metro. &quot;Eight out of 10 bestsellers in Asian bookshops are self-help books. They&apos;ve adopted the worst American excesses and run with them.&quot; That may be most evident in advice to women on &quot;How to snare a rich husband&quot;. He laments the &quot;culture of\u00a0&apos;remaindered women&apos;, who are still single after the age of 26 \u2013 which is every woman I know in Shanghai. They have the outward trappings of modern, feminist success, but their lives are geared to despairingly searching for a husband. It&apos;s atavistic.&quot; In a novel of missed connections, characters can prove as fake as the handbags in Shanghai&apos;s markets. &quot;People are incredibly lonely in this huge city, twice the size of London,&quot; Aw says. &quot;They&apos;re swept up by the tide of energy and forget what they&apos;re looking for. The don&apos;t just want money or a business deal, but something deeper.&quot; Two writer&apos;s residencies in Shanghai between 2009 and 2011 helped him shed some prejudices, on internet censorship, for example: &quot;People think\u00a0the Chinese must live in total ignorance, but Chinese my age are so skilled, they have access to everything they want. There are blogs and Twitter \u2013 but in Chinese, so most people don&apos;t read them. I saw more freedom of speech in Shanghai than I see in Singapore or Thailand.&quot; China &quot;exists on so many levels. The official level is\u00a0incredibly chauvinist, and the patriarchal system drives me nuts \u2013\u00a0it\u00a0reminds me of my upbringing. But\u00a0when you get past that it&apos;s like any\u00a0other Asian city: there&apos;s a colour, vitality, local and regional identities.&quot; When in Shanghai, he lived in a block where the average age was over 70, and people had endured China&apos;s cultural revolution of 1966-76. &quot;But even though they&apos;ve been through such a lot, I was the recipient of so many acts\u00a0of kindness every day.&quot; His understanding has another source. &quot;I\u00a0have first cousins from a branch that didn&apos;t make it out of rural Malaysia, from a horrible little village. My parents were lucky \u2013 they went to college and moved to Kuala Lumpur, so\u00a0I had a suburban childhood. To them, China represents opportunity. When I see it through their eyes, it&apos;s a\u00a0marvellous thing.&quot; He was born in 1971 in Taipei, to Malaysian parents working in the Taiwanese capital. His father was an electrical engineer, and his mother a quantity surveyor. By the time he came back to Malaysia he already felt like an\u00a0outsider. He grew up in ethnic Chinese neighbourhoods. His\u00a0parents were from &quot;very poor backgrounds&quot;, their families part of the large-scale migration from China to Malaya from the 19th century to the 1930s. Aw, who grew up speaking Malay, Mandarin, Cantonese and English, regrets that he\u00a0never learned his father&apos;s Hainanese dialect, a &quot;magical, warm, rich and unsual language. It wasn&apos;t considered an educated dialect so he didn&apos;t speak to us in it.&quot; Nor did he know his mother&apos;s Hokkien dialect, so he found it\u00a0hard to communicate with his cousins, which reinforced his sense of\u00a0being an outsider. All his grandparents lived &quot;deep in\u00a0the heart of the Malaysian jungle&quot;, in the Kinta valley, the setting for his first novel. He recalls &quot;terrifying and exciting&quot; school holidays in his grandmother&apos;s house on the banks of a &quot;big muddy river&quot;, where his uncle still lives. &quot;Big extended Chinese families can be warm and enveloping, not just ghastly structures. But the house was rudimentary, with monitor lizards eating shit off the outside toilets, and rats in the rooms.&quot; During the second world war, the area had been a support base for Chinese communist guerrilla resistance to the Japanese occupation of 1942-45. &quot;So entire villages were singled out for brutal treatment by the Japanese army. I&apos;m not sure if my maternal grandfather was tortured, but I know that behind the silence there were untold stories.&quot; While, to his own generation, &quot;Japan meant cool, electronic gadgets,&quot; his\u00a0parents grew up with\u00a0&quot;anti-Japanese sentiment in their blood&quot;. That animosity might have been behind their perverse choice of a\u00a0Ford Cortina when Malaysia&apos;s prime minister Mahathir Mohamad launched his &quot;Buy British Last&quot; campaign in 1981,\u00a0and urged the country to look east\u00a0towards Japan. &quot;The wave of nationalism was strange,&quot; Aw recalls. &quot;The street names were changed to Malaysian ones, but the middle classes were still speaking to each other in English.&quot; In the late 1970s and 80s, &quot;we were distracted because we were all getting richer. I was only a teenager, but I knew something was not right; that we should be thinking more about where we came from and who we were. Who\u00a0are the indigenous people, the bumiputra or &apos;sons of the earth&apos;? There\u00a0have been immigrant Chinese families in Malaysia for 200 years. Where do they fit, if not as part of the fabric of the country?&quot; One cost of what Aw terms &quot;this crazy march forward&quot; was the &quot;gleeful destruction of old buildings in the name of anti-colonialism. It&apos;s only now, when we&apos;re settled and affluent, that we think: &apos;Oh my God, what did we do?&apos; Old mansions have been replaced by giant, soulless shopping malls.&quot; In his ambitions as a writer, Aw had\u00a0&quot;zero role models. My parents encouraged reading, but to pass exams.&quot; He came to Cambridge to study law in 1991. Writing his first novel, he worked as an auction-house porter and a Chinese-language tutor, before the need for money drove him into a law firm for four years. He quit in 2002 to enrol at the University of East Anglia&apos;s creative writing school (&quot;very cutthroat&quot;) and sold his debut novel by the end of the academic year. Though keen on Conrad, he found much writing about his native region, from Anthony Burgess to JG Farrell, &quot;unsatisfactory \u2013 it didn&apos;t speak to me&quot;. Somerset Maugham was &quot;invariably writing about white people \u2013 except for\u00a0coolies or servants, who were slightly shifty&quot;. Though he admires the\u00a0Malaysian writer KS Maniam, he felt, along with Tan, that &quot;we had to reinvent the south-east Asian novel&quot;. His narratives circle events, viewing the\u00a0same scenes through different eyes \u2013 reflecting his quarrel with &quot;how history is rewritten in a country like Malaysia. A lot of modern Asian narratives seek refuge in homogeneity. But we know it\u00a0doesn&apos;t exist.&quot; He grew up with TV dramas and music from the giant neighbour, Indonesia. Map of the Invisible World is\u00a0a tale of two separated orphans during President Sukarno&apos;s &quot;year of living dangerously&quot;, a time of anti-communist purges. The two countries, Aw says, are spoken of as brothers, united by a common language and religion. &quot;We were supposed to bond against the Zionist-supporting Singapore, with its pork-eating Chinese population. But people forget Malaysia was Sukarno&apos;s arch enemy&quot;, during Konfrontasi \u2013 Indonesia&apos;s undeclared war against Malaysia. Aw&apos;s impulse was the &quot;sense of losing our past. My parents&apos; generation lived through it, but mine had no idea.&quot; Countries are &quot;absurdly retreating into the security of borders&quot;, he says, &quot;but coming from a small country, you can&apos;t help but see Malaysia&apos;s place in a wider world&quot;. That vision may chime with a growing readership in Asia&apos;s burgeoning leisured classes, with the new-found time to look back. For Aw, dislocation from the past &quot;invariably means you&apos;re not going to know where your future lies&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/16/melbourne-australian-f1-grand-prix", "sentences": ["&quot;He will come now either before or after the Singapore Grand Prix."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-16T14:50:22Z", "title": "Park passion adds value to Melbourne's pricey but 'best grand prix'", "tags": ["Formula One 2013", "Formula One", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Motor sport", "Sport", "World news", "Melbourne"], "article": "Even by the richly nostalgic standards of the Australian Grand Prix there has been a special feeling around Albert Park this weekend. Bronze busts of the country&apos;s world champions, Alan Jones and Jack Brabham, were unveiled and old cars have been rolled out to mark the fact that the grand prix was held here for the first time 60 years ago. Then names such as Bugatti, Talbot, Alfa Romeo, MG, Dodge, Maybach, Allard, Plymouth, Austin-Healey, Holden and Javelin could be found on the starting grid. &quot;In the year that saw Everest conquered, motor racing in Australia scaled new heights of its own,&quot; declared a special souvenir programme. &quot;We are the best grand prix in the world these days in terms of the detail and the effort we put into it,&quot; said Ron Walker, chairman of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, on Saturday. &quot;We have trade fairs here and it is one of the biggest corporate events in the world. We built more grandstands and they were sold out. The paddock club was sold out and the general admission areas have done well. It&apos;s a great success.&quot; But the passion is not universal. Peter Logan, of &apos;Save Albert Park&apos;, said it was time the state government turned its back on the race after the current contract runs out in 2015. &quot;The grand prix is a failed business model,&quot; he said. &quot;If someone wants to take it over, Dr [Denis] Napthine [Victoria&apos;s new premier] should give it to private enterprise.&quot; Even the Australian economy is not impervious to the recent global turndown \u2013 although it has not suffered as badly as Europe \u2013 and many people feel the demands of F1&apos;s ringmaster, Bernie Ecclestone, have become excessive. The Australian Grand Prix, which has been held in Albert Park continuously since 1996, costs Melbourne A$56m (\u00a339m) to stage, with a little over half of that going to F1 and escalation clauses lifting the fee every year. It has become something of a political \u2013 and economic \u2013 football, which is kicked around every time the very expensive show comes to town. The fact that Ecclestone has failed to turn up, as expected, this year has not gone down well with some people. In fact he has attended this race only once this century. But on this occasion he was due to come to have talks with the then Victoria premier, Ted Baillieu, about a new contract but pulled out when Baillieu resigned. &quot;When Mr Baillieu left it was pointless Bernie coming,&quot; Walker said. &quot;He will come now either before or after the Singapore Grand Prix. &quot;The future of this event depends on a deal being done between Formula One Management and the Victoria government and I sense there is a willingness on both sides to have meaningful discussions. Bernie does not come here that often but he doesn&apos;t have to. He knows that we do a good job and he trusts us.&quot; Walker pointed out that the state government was in debt when, in 1996, an events committee was formed to bring big sport \u2013 including F1 \u2013 to the city. He also made the argument that when the deal was done Albert Park was transformed from something of a tip. A spokesman for Dr Napthine said the new premier saw the grand prix as &quot;an important event in Victoria&apos;s sporting calendar&quot; and was keen to begin negotiations. &quot;Any future contract negotiations will include a strong emphasis on value to Victorian taxpayers,&quot; he said. The critics point out that, as Melbourne is arguably the major sporting city in the world (Melbourne Cup, Test cricket at the MCG, Rules football, the Australian Open tennis, Commonwealth Games, etc) it does not really need F1. There is a point here. Those who attended the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide some years ago recall a place in thrall to the event, which is hardly the case in this more diverse and blas\u00e9 city. Those who went to the first grand prix in Austin, Texas, last year will be able to imagine something of the fervour that existed in the capital of South Australia. But Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide are hardly trying to break down Melbourne&apos;s door to get some of the F1 action. If the new people in charge of Victoria can show they have done a good deal with Ecclestone, the race is likely to continue here. Meanwhile visitors have been left to reflect on what a great loss Australia would be to the Formula One circuit. Thanks to Ecclestone the sport is full of far-flung, white elephant stadiums that people \u2013 even the locals \u2013 do not want to go to. The street circuit at Albert Park is a venue to be treasured and a great place to launch a new season."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/mar/18/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["Unsurprisingly, this particular entrepreneur also sells an Android SMS malware package that targets customers of Citibank, HSBC and ING, as well as 66 other financial institutions in Australia, France, India, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey (the complete list is here)."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-18T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Google's other killing, fresh LulzSec mystery, malware in Google Play and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 13 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Gimmick watch: which Galaxy S4 features are actually useful? &gt;&gt; TechRadar By their count, not that many.

While Samsung updated the internals and the software, the S IV is just another iteration on the Galaxy design to be slightly bigger, faster and with a few new apps. &quot;We fully expect the Galaxy S IV to be an excellent flagship phone for Samsung, but Yankee Group doesn&apos;t see the S IV allowing Samsung to gain ground against Apple in the crucial U.S. market. According to Yankee Group&apos;s 2013 U.S. Consumer Survey, March, only about 15% of consumers intend to buy a Samsung phone within the next six months, while 40% intend to buy Apple iPhones within that period.  The brand called &quot;Don&apos;t Know&quot;, meanwhile, has great brand recognition and is a likely next buy for many. And: just wait for Samsung to start an advertising blitz in the US. What else Google is shutting down &gt;&gt; inessential.com Brent Simmons (who wrote one of the great RSS readers, NetNewsWire):   While the demise of Google Reader got all the attention, there are some other things going away in A second spring of cleaning. It&apos;s worth reading. One of the interesting ones: the CalDAV API will be removed for all but whitelisted developers. CalDAV builds on WebDAV and is an open standard. Instead you&apos;d have to use the Google Calendar API. I wouldn&apos;t have noticed this except that I was out with two calendar developers last night: John Chaffee of BusyCal and Michael Simmons of Flexibits. I suspect they&apos;ve got some coding to do. Google certainly has the right to shut things down \u2014 and I think they&apos;re right to do so, also. The company&apos;s been all over the place and should continue to work on focus. But I don&apos;t like when they turn off existing support for an open standard like CalDAV in favor of a Google-only API. Sure, they can \u2014 it&apos;s within their rights, obviously. But I don&apos;t like it.  To those who think Google has a commitment to free and open source: get real. That only applies when it will commoditise a rival&apos;s paid-for products to zero price and so destroy them.

Introducing China&apos;s &apos;820 Party&apos; &gt;&gt; Tea Leaf Nation  Yesterday, CCTV, China&apos; state-run television network, ran an expose on Apple, generating to an outcry against the company on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform. News quickly broke, however, that CCTV had paid celebrities to post anti-Apple remarks. A slip up on the part of Peter Ho, a Taiwanese-American movie star and spokesperson for Samsung Galaxy, provided a glimpse behind the scenes. He posted:  #315isLive# Wow, Apple has so many tricks in its after-sales services. As an Apple fan, I&apos;m hurt. You think this would be acceptable to Steve Jobs? Or to those young people who sold their kidneys [to buy iPads]? It&apos;s really true that big chains treat customers poorly. Post around 8:20.  Ho was later updated his Weibo with a post claiming his phone had been stolen and that he hasn&apos;t posted the previous message, but Weibo users had already noticed that he failed to delete the last sentence of the offending tweet, his instructions.

Apple&apos;s Galaxy challenge in three easy charts &gt;&gt; Barrons.com  [Tavis] McCourt [of brokers Raymond James], who has an Outperform rating on Apple shares and a $600 price target, confines himself to the simple observation that &quot;iPhone shipments since 2010 (when Samsung launched the Galaxy line) still dwarf Galaxy sales, but Samsung is closing the gap.&quot; McCourt thinks Apple&apos;s iPhone again outsold Galaxy this quarter, but that the positions will reverse next quarter. Here are three choice charts from the report.  The charts make interesting viewing, though as Apple doesn&apos;t break down iPhone sales between the 4, 4S and 5 (and the period shown includes a time when it was selling the 3GS too) and Samsung simply doesn&apos;t give any accountable figures for smartphone sales, you might want to take them with some salt. The InternetFeds: Inside hacker Sabu&apos;s war room &gt;&gt; Reuters.com Matthew Keys, writing in March 2012:   On December 20, 2010, a report by the PBS NewsHour exposed a document that contained dozens of government usernames and passwords. The document, which was published on the NewsHour website, was only known to InternetFeds. It became clear that someone among the ranks was a mole. Paranoia swept through the room [of elite Anonymous hackers]. There were discussions of who the mole might be. A hacker named Switch was a popular guess. Some people thought it was me. (I later said I gave the documents to NewsHour.) Several other incidents took place that added to the paranoia. The website of New York&apos;s Green Party, which InternetFeds planned to attack in an &quot;epic owning,&quot; was defaced without the approval of the room&apos;s members. An article on the Los Angeles Times&apos; website was defaced by a hacker, again without collective approval.  What&apos;s significant about this is that Keys, who seems to have had access to the chatroom, is accused of being the person who gave login details to the hacker who defaced the LA Times.

Mobile malcoders pay to (Google) Play &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security Brian Krebs:   An explosion in malware targeting Android users is being fueled in part by a budding market for mobile malcode creation kits, as well as a brisk market for hijacked or fraudulent developer accounts at Google Play that can be used to disguise malware as legitimate apps for sale. I recently encountered an Android malware developer on a semi-private Underweb forum who was actively buying up verified developer accounts at Google Play for $100 apiece. Google charges just $25 for Android developers who wish to sell their applications through the Google Play marketplace, but it also requires the accounts to be approved and tied to a specific domain. The buyer in this case is offering $100 for sellers willing to part with an active, verified Play account that \u00a0is tied to a dedicated server. Unsurprisingly, this particular entrepreneur also sells an Android SMS malware package that targets customers of Citibank, HSBC and ING, as well as 66 other financial institutions in Australia, France, India, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey (the complete list is here). The targeted banks offer text messages as a form of multi-factor authentication, and this bot is designed to intercept all incoming SMS messages on infected Android phones.  Grabbing SMSs stops you seeing two-factor authentication confirmations sent from your bank when a new transaction - by the malware - is initiated. (Look up Eurograbber: it&apos;s big business.) The Human impact of bugs &gt;&gt; Jury.me A three-act play with software. Starts out very sad. Improves. Morality lesson in the middle/end. Google Reader still drives far more traffic than Google+ &gt;&gt; Buzzfeed  According to data from the BuzzFeed Network, a set of tracked partner sites that collectively have over 300 million users, Google Reader is still a significant source of traffic for news \u2014 and a much larger one than Google+. The above chart, created by BuzzFeed&apos;s data team, represents data collected from August 2012 to today. (Yesterday, Google announced that it would close Reader in July.) We should add that this data isn&apos;t complete. Google Reader traffic became much harder to measure last year when Google began defaulting users to SSL encryption in such a way that masked referral data. And this doesn&apos;t include data from apps that use Google Reader as a sync service, such as Reeder. In other words, it&apos;s likely that we&apos;re actually missing some Reader traffic here.  From the graph, the ratio looks like roughly 70:1 for Reader:G+.

Today&apos;s interviewees did just that. For eight years Will Martindale (30) worked at JP Morgan and then BNP Paribas, only to jump ship and join Oxfam. He was joined by Erinch Sahan (31) from Australia, who left Procter &amp; Gamble for Oxfam. Their mission: to bring their knowledge and expertise to bear on finance and the corporate world. This is controversial stuff in the NGO world and both are very happy to come into the comment thread below to answer your questions. Here are their answers to mine: Will When I handed in my resignation, my colleagues didn&apos;t quite know how to respond. Usually in an investment bank when you announce you&apos;re leaving, it&apos;s because you got a more lucrative job offer. So they will go: &quot;Okay, how much?&quot; [to make you stay]. But when I told them I was going to work for Oxfam for a fraction my salary, well, what do you say to that? They did ask: &quot;Can&apos;t we send you to Singapore? Give a good relocation package?&quot; But I didn&apos;t want to go Singapore. I wanted to work for Oxfam in London. People always knew that I was relatively leftwing, so in that sense it probably didn&apos;t come as a complete surprise. A couple of colleagues called me a tree hugger but most expressed support. Some suddenly told me about their own projects. Turned out that one of the bank&apos;s guys in emerging markets research had a wife who ran an ethical tea plantation. I had no idea. I started JP Morgan&apos;s graduate scheme in 2006. I never intended to work there for more than a year, but you get caught up and the job becomes a lifestyle. You work very long hours, surrounded by people who do the same, and they become your friends. You are all on a similar income, you eat at the same type of restaurants, go on the same kind of holidays, live in the same kind of apartments, develop the same hobbies. In all you get a slightly distorted view of the challenges other people face. You don&apos;t see poverty, if only because you go to work very early, and come home late, often taking a cab provided by the bank. Where I live in Battersea there are increasingly two communities, one very rich and one very poor. The only places the two might meet is at Clapham Junction and the odd shop. Many investment bankers will be in this life for 20 years, then a few more years at a hedge fund, and that&apos;ll be it. I always knew that was not for me. When I had been with JP Morgan for nine or ten months, they sent me to New York to run a CDO trading platform there. I would be working trades with exposures of hundreds of millions of dollars. I was so junior, 23 or so! I remember when someone from the American regulatory agency the Securities and Exchange Commission came over to shadow me for a day. He was very young, too, and had no real understanding of what I was doing. There was no way that he could challenge even a green junior banker like me. Back then, the quality of regulators was so weak. My Damascene conversion, if you will, came during the financial crisis when Bear Stearns fell. There were a number of trades outstanding between JP Morgan and Bear Stearns and we went over to price them up. Now, usually when there&apos;s a trade of the kind I was in, if I am 5 million up, you must be 5 million down. It&apos;s zero sum. But when we looked at it up-close, it turned out that while our models said that we were say 3.5 million up, their models stated that they were up, too, by 2.5 million! That drove home the point for me how flimsy risk management structures really were. Moving to an NGO wasn&apos;t always easy. First there&apos;s the vernacular. I would get asked what I thought of the rights-based approach to development? I had no idea. I could tell you about the delta on CDSs, though. Also, you make sacrifices. Before taking this job I went on holiday to Vietnam, staying in very nice hotels ... I realised that this would no longer be possible, I had said goodbye to that kind of lifestyle. I remember thinking the first few weeks at Oxfam: wow, I can work from home, this is nice, have the cricket on ... Very soon I found myself working harder than I ever had in the bank, because now I cared. That&apos;s the big difference with banking in the end. Work becomes something very different if you believe in what you&apos;re doing. There are a lot more people like us making the change than outsiders might think. Oxfam&apos;s Rob Nash did the same as me. He left Lehman Brothers where he was on the stock-lending desk, to work in the non-profit sector on financial aspects of sustainable development and poverty reduction. One colleague at JP Morgan became a maths teacher, another at BNP Paribas set up a retirement home. Also, there are far more people inside corporations and banks who want to make the world a better place. So why don&apos;t they join Oxfam or other NGOs? One reason might be the golden handcuffs. They&apos;ve settled into the lifestyle, sent their children to expensive schools ... Neither of us have kids. In finance, one factor is the absence of effective unions who could be a voice for the collective. Especially with the low job security, it becomes all about survival in the firm. Which may be why it is increasingly male as you go up in these organisations. I remember the structured credit desk at BNP Paribas had just one woman trader. There&apos;s this huge untapped potential in banks, and we should try to tap it. Why do lawyers have a pro bono system but bankers don&apos;t? So we are now working on a project where bankers help to empower people by making them more financially literate. At the same we are running a series of seminars for Oxfam employees called &quot;banks, bankers, and banking&quot;, to improve the internal understanding of the sector. Erinch I escaped twice. I started professional life in financial law. That was the most boring thing on earth, I cannot imagine why anybody would want to become a corporate lawyer. Also, I just had no idea what it actually was I was doing. So I escaped to Procter &amp; Gamble, where at least I understood the products we were selling. But then I discovered that I just couldn&apos;t motivate myself to do this, so I escaped again. When I announced I was leaving, I felt this instant reaction among colleagues like &quot;you were always different from us.&apos; They seemed to say, it was natural for you to leave, and natural for the rest of us to stay. Our world is not rocked. In a way they were right, I never really bought into the corporate culture at Procter &amp; Gamble. I did haircare brands for the Australia and New Zealand market. The culture was super-competitive, all about crushing our competitor. I remember my colleague sitting next to me, who did Duracel. There he was, cheering when the new sales figures showed he had beaten Energizer. I didn&apos;t do fist pumps when we had sold more stuff than Unilever because I just didn&apos;t buy into the company&apos;s mission, that all that mattered was how to sell more stuff, how to design shampoo pumps that gave out more shampoo than the customer needed so that they&apos;d end up buying more shampoo. I still have my farewell email, in which I told my colleagues, look, you can have a far greater impact from the inside than I could ever have from the outside. There are people who care working for these big multinational companies. The thing is: market structures mean that the ones who rise to the top are those who are focussed on short-term sales and profit. Before joining Oxfam I also worked for a government agency for a while, and it really hit me how political things were there, how important perception management is. So there it is: in business you work within very narrow profit parameters, while in government the politicians don&apos;t trust the bureaucrats so they won&apos;t give you much space to work in either. This is what I totally love about Oxfam, there aren&apos;t these paths laid out for you. I have been working for months now on this &quot;behind the brands&quot; scorecard for food companies, ranking them for how they manage land, women, farmers, workers, climate, transparency and water in their supply chains. I found myself reading company&apos;s CSR reports on weekends, even during my holiday. When I have a good idea now, I can act on it. For example, we now have an indicator for how transparent corporations are about their lobbying activities. Some corporations present corporate social responsibility (CSR) simply as the smart thing to do. But there is certainly not always a business case for ethical behaviour. Pressure is needed. We have to work with corporations that want to change, but even more so, we must call out those who don&apos;t. It&apos;s messy. I have been to farms in Africa where female workers have to trade sexual favours for jobs. As a multinational corporation, why would you want to get involved in that? But if you&apos;re buying that farm&apos;s products, you have a responsibility. There is this buffer in banks made up of the people doing CSR. What we want is not only engage with them, but beyond them, with the actual bankers making the decisions. We believe it could help that we speak their language, and understand how finance and business work. Yes, there will always be people saying about corporations and banks, &quot;what&apos;s the point of engaging with them? They&apos;re all evil anyway.&quot; Some in the NGO world tend to see companies as one whole, but it&apos;s a collection of individuals embroiled in all sorts of debates and conflicts. NGOs could help set-off internal debates in these companies, help shape the internal political economy of these corporations. We must empower insiders. Provide them with evidence to help them in their internal battles, work out how we can best push from the outside to help those on the inside. We need to tap into internal debates in companies. For a number of years now Oxfam has worked with parliamentarians to help them see what life is like for poor communities. Why not do the same for bankers? That would be quite something, imagine twenty white guys in a refugee camp in east Congo, all of them connected to trade in the minerals mined there? I wonder about the impact of that. My first night in a refugee camp was unforgettable. The smells, the air of intimidation. I thought to myself, &quot;I am never going to survive this, and I am leaving first thing in the morning.&quot; But I did survive, I stayed on and it changed me forever."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/18/dispose-chopsticks-china-lose-identity", "sentences": ["Although I grew up in Singapore and lived in China for seven years, I never learned to wield chopsticks with dexterity or skill, as if they were graceful extensions of my fingers.", "Singaporean noodle dishes were enjoyed, whenever possible, pulled high and slurped from a fork or twirled around its tines, Italian-style."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-18T11:47:39Z", "title": "Dispose of chopsticks and China loses part of its identity | Audra Ang", "tags": ["Chinese food and drink", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Food", "Environment"], "article": "Although I grew up in Singapore and lived in China for seven years, I never learned to wield chopsticks with dexterity or skill, as if they were graceful extensions of my fingers. Get it right, and no morsel of food, great or small, slippery or sticky, is beyond your reach. Instead of holding my chopsticks parallel and deftly manoeuvring the ends toward each other, I cross mine near the middle so that they pivot for better leverage. I would be told that this &quot;X&quot; signalled ill-wishes to my dining companions, which, of course, was not the case. Since I&apos;m also left-handed (another ancient Chinese no-no), I figure I would just be considered an overall lost cause. Even so, I felt a twinge of unease when I heard that a Chinese legislator was discouraging the use of disposable chopsticks for environmental reasons \u2013 and considering alternatives. Bo Guangxin, chairman of state-owned timber firm Jilin Forestry Industry Group, said that the country produces about 80bn pairs of disposable chopsticks each year, made from 20m 20-year-old trees \u2013 an unsustainable burden on the national forests. &quot;To solve the issue of disposable chopsticks, I think we first need to bring a change to people&apos;s eating habits and urge everyone to carry their own eating utensils around,&quot; he said, &quot;and secondly, we should gradually explore a replacement for them.&quot; What that means is unclear, and how fast this will happen is questionable \u2013 there have been several aborted campaigns to halt the use of disposable chopsticks in recent years \u2014 but if knives and forks are to be that replacement, it will be unthinkable. In China, chopsticks are as quintessential to life and culture as tea and rice or noodles (depending on whether you&apos;re in the north or south). When I lived in Beijing or travelled on assignment, using a fork was rarely an option, certainly not at the hole-in-the-wall eateries which served the most delicious renditions of dumplings, noodles and &quot;homestyle&quot; dishes like tomatoes fried with eggs, fragrant and spicy shredded potatoes, and red braised pork. There are many stories of the provenance of chopsticks, which in some form have been entrenched in Chinese history for thousands of years. Many centre around practical needs \u2013 getting meat out of fire, speed, using whatever is around. There are also many superstitions attached to them: dropping chopsticks is bad luck, sticking them upright in your rice is taboo because of the imagery of incense sticks at funeral altars, and finding an uneven pair means you&apos;re going to miss transport. Then there is the long list of chopsticks don&apos;ts: don&apos;t point with them, don&apos;t spear food with them, don&apos;t use them to tap your bowl; only beggars do that. Among the favourite customs are using them to fish cooked bits of meat and vegetables from boiling broth while eating &quot;hot pot&quot; with friends, and serving choice pieces to show affection or respect, not forgetting to flip the chopsticks around to offer the side that has not touched your mouth. When I was growing up, my parents and I used a knife and fork more often than chopsticks, slicing cleanly into meat-and-veg meals at the western restaurants they favoured. Singaporean noodle dishes were enjoyed, whenever possible, pulled high and slurped from a fork or twirled around its tines, Italian-style. Even when savouring one of my beloved grandmother&apos;s meals \u2013 steamed fish, soy-braised chicken wings, pickled radish stir-fried with sliced pork \u2013 I ate off a plate, heaping food onto a spoon with the help of a fork, while my grandmother held up her bowl and pushed rice into her mouth with her chopsticks in the traditional Chinese way. It was only after my time in China that I had better insight into how integral chopsticks are to the country&apos;s identity. It would be a shame if that gets eroded. Knives and forks, whose use at the table is said to have been discouraged by benevolent philosopher Confucius because they were instruments of killing, don&apos;t have the same rich traditions and legacy of elegance and delicacy. Even my crossed chopsticks and I understand that."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/18/china-arctic-mineral-investment", "sentences": ["Currently, 80% of China&apos;s imported energy passes through the Strait of Malacca \u2013 a crowded, heavily pirated waterway that squeezes past Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-18T20:28:26Z", "title": "China pours cash into melting Arctic in bid to win influence", "tags": ["Arctic", "China", "Norway", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Europe", "Sea ice", "Polar regions", "Environment"], "article": "At face value, it is not one of the world&apos;s most important relationships. When Norway and China fell out two years ago over a Nobel prize awarded to a Chinese dissident, the spat had little wider resonance. But diplomatic relations are thawing as quickly as Arctic ice \u2013 and the upshot could be significant for the frigid northern wastes of the planet, which are thought to sit on formidable quantities of mineral reserves. China has been cosying up to Arctic countries as part of its effort to secure &quot;permanent observer&quot; status on the Arctic Council, an eight-country political body that decides regional policy. Norway was initially sniffy at the approaches because of the Nobel row, but appears to have changed its tune before a formal decision in May. Last week, the Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, told reporters in Oslo that he strongly supported China&apos;s application. The &quot;argument for opening up for more observers in the Arctic Council is that they will then be a member of our club,&quot; he said, according to Norwegian media. &quot;Then the danger of them forming their own club will be smaller.&quot; &quot;There are not many areas where Norway is important to China at all, but the Arctic is one of them,&quot; said Leiv Lunde, director of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in Lysaker, Norway. China, he added, was beginning to realise that its diplomatic boycott &quot;is not good PR in sort of bolstering the positive image that China wants to bolster as an Arctic player&quot;. Currently, 80% of China&apos;s imported energy passes through the Strait of Malacca \u2013 a crowded, heavily pirated waterway that squeezes past Singapore. Yet over the past few years, melting Arctic ice, a casualty of climate change, has turned the frigid north into a viable shipping route. The newly navigable northern sea route above Russia would cut the distance between Shanghai and northern Europe by 4,000 miles, saving medium-sized bulk carriers about two weeks and \u00a3260,000 on each journey. Three years ago, no ships made the voyage. Last year, there were 46. Last August, Chinese scientists aboard a Ukrainian-built icebreaker, the Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, completed the country&apos;s first trans-Arctic ship voyage from Shanghai to Iceland. The trip&apos;s leader, Huigen Yang, told Reuters this week that Chinese shipping companies, encouraged by the ship&apos;s success, may be planning a commercial voyage along the same route as soon as this summer. Scandinavian shipping companies \u2013 long an influential force in the region&apos;s politics \u2013 are also ebullient about the development. &quot;For the producers up north, all of a sudden they have a two-tier market to play on,&quot; said Henrik Falck, a project manager at Norway&apos;s Tschudi Shipping Company. &quot;They can either ship their cargo to China or the far east, or they can send it to the continent as they are doing today. And the transportation cost is no longer killing the deal.&quot; Although China has never announced an official Arctic policy, some fear that its regional economic interests could have military implications. Furthermore, the US Geological Survey estimates that 30% of the world&apos;s undiscovered natural gas reserves lie above the Arctic Circle, in addition to vast deposits of oil, coal, rare earths and uranium, and experts say that China wants to get in on the ground floor. &quot;The way I see it, very minor investments for China now can warrant very big rewards in the future,&quot; said Malte Humpert, founder and executive director of the Arctic Institute in Washington DC. &quot;It&apos;s a low risk and obvious choice.&quot; One indicator is China&apos;s recent interest in Greenland. The vast, self-governing country&apos;s parliament is considering approving a $2.3bn (\u00a31.5bn) mining project north-east of the capital, Nuuk, which would be led by the UK-based London Mining plc but supply China with 15m tonnes of iron ore a year. The project, which may kick off this summer, would require a team of 3,000 Chinese workers, adding more than 4% to the country&apos;s population of 57,000. Some fear that it would affect Greenland&apos;s pristine natural environment, which locals rely on for hunting and fishing. Greenland&apos;s prime minister, Aleqa Hammond, who was elected last Tuesday, has promised to assuage these fears by limiting inflows of cheap labour from abroad. &quot;What could the creation of a mine and the arrival of some 3,000 Chinese workers mean to me as an inhabitant of a hamlet? What will it mean to me and my hunting grounds?&quot; she told the Associated Press. Tiny, 320,000-population Iceland may best represent the polarity of Europe&apos;s reactions to China&apos;s Arctic aspirations. Last year, Icelandic authorities rejected a Chinese billionaire&apos;s bid to turn land in the country&apos;s barren north into a holiday resort. Some said that the development&apos;s proximity to deepwater ports could pose security risks. Yet former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao made Iceland his first stop on his European tour last spring, signing Arctic co-operation agreements with the Icelandic prime minister. China&apos;s $250m embassy in Iceland&apos;s capital, Reykjavik, can accommodate 500 personnel; in contrast the US embassy has a staff of 70.

He&apos;s an avid reader, and he speaks about five different languages, so he&apos;ll be rattling off in English to you and in French to someone else, and in German to someone else and then the phone rings and he&apos;s speaking in Italian,&quot; Knightley said recently. The film \u2013 which will also feature French actor Clotilde Hesme as Adrienne, as well as model Brad Kroenig and his four-year-old son, Hudson, who is Lagerfeld&apos;s godson \u2013 will be screened at Chanel&apos;s Cruise Show in Singapore in May. Lagerfeld, who is in his 70s but refuses to give his birth date, is known for his disciplined approach to projects, including his hobby, photography. He has published several books of photographs and in 1996 was awarded a cultural prize from the German Society of Photography. Although he played himself in the 2006 film La Doublure, it is thought to be the first time he has been the other side of a movie camera.

J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, the budget minister, who has vehemently and repeatedly denied the accusations, stood down hours after it was announced a legal investigation had been opened into the accusations. The launching of legal proceedings for &quot;fiscal fraud&quot; did not name Cahuzac but centres on claims that he hid money from the French tax authorities, first in Switzerland and then in Singapore. It followed a preliminary inquiry opened in January to determine whether a voice on a recording of an alleged conversation between Cahuzac and his wealth manager in 2000 was indeed that of the minister. On TuesdayCahuzac continued to insist he was innocent, and lambasted what he said were defamatory accusations. He said he had resigned for the &quot;good of the government&quot;. A spokesperson for Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said the president had accepted Cahuzac&apos;s resignation and removed him from office. In a statement, he thanked Cahuzac for his &quot;talent and competence&quot;, and said he applauded his decision to resign to &quot;better defend his honour&quot;. French prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault added that Cahuzac had resigned in order to concentrate on his legal defence and &quot;to not embarrass the government&quot;. &quot;The prime minister regrets but understands his [Cahuzac&apos;s] decision and thanks him for his work in government,&quot; said a statement from the PM&apos;s office. It is the first serious scandal to hit Hollande since his election last May and a blow to his government, which he promised would be &quot;beyond reproach&quot;. The embarrassment is compounded by the fact that Cahuzac, 60, a former MP and cardiologist who became a hair transplant surgeon, has headed Hollande&apos;s efforts to cut its public deficit and stamp out tax evasion. He had appeared to be in the clear last month after the Swiss authorities said they could find no trace of an account. However, the French investigative website Mediapart, which broke the original story, insisted it had evidence. Mediapart claimed in January to have evidence that Cahuzac had an undeclared account at the Swiss bank UBS for 20 years until 2010. The website alleged he travelled to Switzerland to close the Geneva-based account and transfer the money in it to Singapore shortly before he was made head of the parliamentary finance commission in February 2010. An alleged recording of a conversation between Cahuzac and his wealth manager in 2000 about his embarrassment over the Swiss account was published by Mediapart. &quot;What bothers me is that I still have an account open with UBS \u2026 UBS is not necessarily the most hidden of banks,&quot; he is alleged to have said. Cahuzac insisted the voice in the recording was not his, and announced he was suing Mediapart for defamation. &quot;I do not have, I have never had a foreign [bank] account. Not now. Not before,&quot; he told MPs in December. During his successful presidential campaign, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande insisted his government would be &quot;beyond reproach&quot;. The editor of Mediapart, Edwy Plenel, has publicly insisted he stood by the story. &quot;There is one question we need to ask our government, prime minister and president. Can the budget minister, the head of the tax administration, carry out his work properly and legitimately when there is enough evidence to open a preliminary investigation?&quot; he said in January. On Tuesday Mediapart said it had been vindicated: &quot;For more than three months now, Mediapart has put forward information that has today been confirmed, validated and verified by the prosecutor&apos;s office in Paris and investigators,&quot; Plenel said. &quot;The real question is why Monsieur Cahuzac lied with such aplomb? Did he lie for himself? Did he lie for others?&quot; One or several independent investigating judges will be appointed in the next few days to delve into the Mediapart recording. Europe1 radio said three witnesses who had heard the recording had recognised Cahuzac&apos;s voice. The prosecutor&apos;s office said in a statement: &quot;The investigations carried out as part of the preliminary inquiry must continue from now in a more appropriate form&quot;, saying the opening of an official inquiry would enable detectives to officially request information from Switzerland and Singapore. Thierry Mandon, spokesman for the Socialist group in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, said Cahuzac&apos;s resignation was &quot;unavoidable&quot;. &quot;It was unavoidable in the sense that its a good point of law that those who have to go and defend themselves before the court can concentrate on their defence,&quot; Mandon said. &quot;We have to move fast but at the same time we have to respect the person who must now defend himself in the court.&quot; Cahuzac was replaced as budget minister by the European affairs minister, Bernard Cazeneuve."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/smart-cities-sustainable-urban-environments", "sentences": ["Depending on the criteria, Miller picked out San Francisco, Singapore, Santander and Barcelona."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-20T16:42:05Z", "title": "Smart cities: how to build sustainable urban environments?", "tags": ["Smart cities"], "article": "The statistics speak for themselves. The world&apos;s population is urbanising and expanding faster than ever. By 2050, well over half the planet&apos;s estimated nine billion people will be living in cities. If we don&apos;t &quot;smarten&quot; up our urban infrastructure, daily life could slowly ground to a halt. So what can be done to encourage &quot;smart city&quot; developments? That question was at the centre of a live Q&amp;A session, which was recently hosted online by the Guardian, in association with Barclays, Bird &amp; Bird and Cisco. Questions posted online and on Twitter were answered by a panel of six subject experts: Ronald Hendrikx, partner at law firm Bird &amp; Bird; John Jones, from Barclays Specialist Finance team; Gareth Macnaughton, director of Innovation &amp; Strategy Government at Cisco Systems; Usman Haque, director at Haque Design + Research; Peter Head, executive chair of the Ecological Sequestration Trust and chairman of the Institute for Sustainability; and Richard Miller, head of sustainability for the Technology Strategy Board. To kickstart the debate, a participant posting on Twitter asked for a definition of smart cities. Peter Head suggested that smartness lies in tools for making good decisions, not necessarily in smart technology itself. Usman Haque was also cautious about attributing too much value to physical infrastructure. &quot;I believe smartness arises in expanded human interactions and creativity&quot;, he argued. So for him it&apos;s more about &quot;smart citizens&quot;, than smart cities. The Q&amp;A session then considered why many urban planners look at the cost of investing in the latest technology and balk, and Gareth Macnaughton argued that a change of focus is needed. Forget mega-projects, he suggested. &quot;Smaller agile partners need to be able to deliver the &apos;smarts&apos;.&quot; It&apos;s important to stay realistic, added Miller. No city is going to back an unproven SME or start-up; instead &quot;imaginative integrators&quot; are needed. That is, organisations and individuals that can make the links between small innovative players. There are other clinchers to encourage smart city developments too, the Q&amp;A was told. One is to crystallise the advantages up front. &quot;It is hard to bring new ideas unless you can show their benefits in advance,&quot; said Head. He proposed that independent &quot;resource and economic modelling&quot; could be the best means of building an &quot;evidenced-based&quot; case. Another compelling driver is leadership, &quot;plain and simple&quot;, said Macnaughton. &quot;We have technologies and innovative new building methods but often we lack the leadership to be able to bring together different management lines, budgets and concerns and enforce co-operation.&quot; The debate then turned to the question of &quot;who will pay for all this?&quot; Miller, noted that most city governments &quot;are desperate to invest&quot; but simply don&apos;t have the money. So the question passes to the financial community. What are investors looking for? He saw glimmers of hope in &quot;impact investment&quot;; namely, where risk is divided up between the pubic sector (which takes the higher risk parts) and the financial sector (which takes more conventional level risk). John Jones from Barclays felt that &quot;appropriate allocation&quot; of risk made plenty of sense. &quot;Parcelling&quot; projects up to spread the total capital expenditure is another potential solution too. And Ronald Hendrikx pointed to further alternatives. Community infrastructure levies and &quot;tax increment financing&quot; for businesses were two ideas high on his list. Tweaking established funding tools marked another option. As a case in point, he cited the use of forfeiting in energy service company projects. The need to involve citizens was a recurring theme of the Q&amp;A session. Residents&apos; needs should be the starting point for smart cities. Macnaughton anticipated a revamping of the &quot;active citizen&quot; community, with local residents increasingly interacting and co-operating thanks to internet-based media. Haque highlighted the example of the city of Boston in the US, which launched a smartphone app enabling citizens to file city complaints publicly. &quot;They found that citizens themselves started getting involved with fixing things that fellow citizens complained about,&quot; he noted. He also cited dontflush.me, a citizen-designed web tool to advise New York residents about overflowing sewers. &quot;The real innovation \u2013 the reinvention of what city-making can be \u2013 is found in the entrepreneurial and creative actions of citizens, not necessarily big businesses, real estate companies or the omniscience of city planning,&quot; he observed. How to get consumers to change their behaviours is a related issue that exercised the panel&apos;s imagination as well. Miller proposed energy use as a &quot;good area&quot; in which to start. For Peter Head, it all came down to transparency of information. &quot;If you publish average consumption data for different types of property, then people try to beat the average,&quot; he stated. The same goes for water and waste: we all like to outdo the average. In this sense, the fact that smart meters are soon to be rolled out across UK households promises to be a positive measure. Finally, a poster on Twitter asked the panellists which city is a benchmark for &quot;smartness&quot;. While not everyone on the panel wished to be drawn on the question of which are today&apos;s smart city leaders, Amsterdam got Macnaughton&apos; vote and Head went for Copenhagen. Depending on the criteria, Miller picked out San Francisco, Singapore, Santander and Barcelona. &quot;They each offer something special, but no one I have yet seen has the full picture,&quot; he concluded. Cities must learn from one another, the panellists agreed, something that is beginning to happen through smart city associations such as C40 and Living-Labs Global, organisations which aim to promote and share smart city best practice. Miller concluded by mentioning the Technology Strategy Board&apos;s Future Cities Special Interest Group programme, in which 30 UK cities were asked to detail changes that they would make to meet tomorrow&apos;s challenges. The findings show that there is no single answer, he noted: &quot;The amazing thing is that there is such a diversity of challenge, ambition and proposed solution[s].&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Sustainable Business in association with Bird &amp; Bird, Cisco and Barclays.

Welcome to adult education in marriage and fertility, Singapore-style. &quot;Alice&quot; is one of 15 fairytales revamped for a new government-backed scheme to encourage Singaporeans to get married and start having babies earlier. Faced with a rapidly ageing society, skyrocketing housing prices, low birth rates and a population that works the longest hours in the world, this country of 5.3 million people has made various attempts over the years to encourage its citizens to marry and procreate, from government-funded speed-dating schemes to educational flyers on how to flirt. Now, however, it is changing its tactics in search of a happy ending.     An illustration from the Golden Goose fairytale about declining fertility. Photograph: The Singaporean Fairytale    Aimed at 21- to 30-year-olds, the &quot;Singaporean Fairytale&quot; was created by four final-year university students who wanted to &quot;find an interesting way to connect with young adults \u2026 on what it takes to start, live and be a family in Singapore&quot;, says the project manager, Chan Luo Er, 23. &quot;Fairytales are very accessible, as almost everyone grew up with a fairytale or two \u2013 our little poem on a woman&apos;s declining fertility as she ages ties in quite nicely with the Golden Goose.&quot; The fairytales \u2013 which have been distributed by leaflet to universities around Singapore \u2013 include versions of Cinderella, the Three Little Pigs, Rapunzel and Snow White, each involving a reworked tale that relates to fertility, sex or marriage, and a resulting moral. The lesson with &quot;careless&quot; Alice, for example, is that &quot;the extended adolescence of twentysomethings today has a biological cost for women&quot; and the story ends with a stark warning: &quot;After 40, [fertility] drops 95%.&quot; The scheme has proved popular on both its website and Facebook page among students who appreciate its attempts at creative humour. But it comes at a time of widespread disillusionment with the government&apos;s efforts to boost population figures. Just last month, parliament passed a controversial white paper that will see the island increase its population by a third by 2030, in effect granting citizenship to more foreigners and squashing the native population to just over half the total, in order &quot;to remain a key node in the network of global cities&quot;. . Perhaps more tellingly, the fairytale initiative raises the question of what exactly the Singaporean fairytale is \u2013 a notion that the government and the public have been debating in recent months. &quot;When we were much younger, I think many of us were exposed to the idea of obtaining the five Cs: cash, car, condo, country club and credit card,&quot; says Chan. &quot;But we think times are changing \u2026 For us, the Singaporean fairytale is about living life the way that makes you happy \u2013 so it could either be setting up your own business or even starting a family early.&quot; Activists and critics say too much stress is placed on Singapore&apos;s TFR \u2013 total fertility rate \u2013 when the city state really needs to assess its work-life balance. They say such government schemes fail to account for women who choose to be single, do not want babies, or are in non-heterosexual relationships. &quot;These fairytales barely begin to scratch the surface of the overwhelming decisions Singaporeans face when considering [life&apos;s] trade-offs and do little to provide them with the information they need to help them with that,&quot; wrote Singaporean blogger Fikri Alkhatib in response to the group&apos;s notion that &quot;[Singaporeans] can have it all, if only you choose to&quot;. &quot;Singaporeans aren&apos;t just &apos;choosing&apos; not to have it &apos;all&apos;. That&apos;s pretty extraordinarily insulting. They either cannot, or they choose to reject the idea of your &apos;all&apos;.&quot; Critics point to other recent schemes promoting conventional themes about women&apos;s roles in society as proof that Singapore is simply out of touch. In the Singapore Dating Guidebook, the modern-day, corporate woman is called a &quot;Singapore New Independent Princess&quot; (SNIP) and is offered dating advice such as: &quot;If he lets you pick up the tab or worse \u2013 expects payment-in-kind \u2013 RUN!&quot; &quot;It entrenches all the stereotypes and it&apos;s unfortunate that it&apos;s supported by the government,&quot; says Corinna Lim of Singapore&apos;s Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) of the similarly outdated fairytale advice. &quot;It&apos;s an old-fashioned way of trying to solve this problem. It&apos;s going backwards when going forwards would be what Scandinavian countries are doing \u2013 making it easier for women to have babies and allowing men to take part [through paternity schemes], instead of pressuring women by saying they&apos;re not married yet.&quot; The government recently passed a \u00a31bn parenthood and fertility package which will fund assisted reproduction and finally give fathers a week of paternity leave. It has also released a series of educational cartoons for those looking for love, with tips such as: &quot;Look out for a favourite topic your date has, or anything that your date has mentioned \u2013 this gives the feeling that you are interested in your date,&quot; and: &quot;Scout your surroundings for possible chat topics, or comment on an interesting accessory your date is wearing&quot; to avoid awkward conversation. But the mere fact that the government feels it has to teach its citizens how to flirt may alone show why the population isn&apos;t higher. Lim says: &quot;It&apos;s an indication that our education system, in focusing so intensively on grades, has failed to give us the life skills we need.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2013/mar/22/earth-hour-switch-off-lights", "sentences": ["Some of the key landmarks that will mark the event include the Sydney opera house and Harbour bridge, Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore&apos;s Marina Bay Sands, Tokyo tower, Taipei 101, the Bird&apos;s Nest in Beijing, the Gateway of India, the world&apos;s tallest building the Burj Khalifa, the Ancient Citadel of Erbil in Kurdistan, Table Mountain, the Bosphorus Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the UK Houses of Parliament, Buckingham palace, the Empire State Building, Niagara Falls and Los Angeles airport.", "At the global media launch for Earth Hour 2013 in Singapore last month, CEO and co-founder, Andy Ridley, highlighted the grassroots nature of the movement:  &quot;People from all walks of life, from all nations around the world, are the lifeblood of the Earth Hour interconnected global community."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T13:04:00Z", "title": "Earth Hour: millions prepare to switch off the lights | Jessica Aldred", "tags": ["Earth Hour", "Environment", "World news", "Energy", "Climate change", "Activism", "WWF"], "article": "Earth Hour is here again, and WWF is calling on hundreds of millions of people in thousands of cities and towns around the world to switch off their lights for an hour at 8.30pm local time on Saturday 23 March to show their concern for the environment. Last year saw the lights go out in homes and businesses in more than 6,950 cities and towns. The campaign even went into space when astronauts reduced power on the International Space Station. This year, more than 150 countries and territories are expected to participate, with Palestine, Tunisia, Galapagos, Suriname, French Guyana, St Helena and Rwanda joining the movement for the first time. Some of the key landmarks that will mark the event include the Sydney opera house and Harbour bridge, Petronas towers in Kuala Lumpur, Singapore&apos;s Marina Bay Sands, Tokyo tower, Taipei 101, the Bird&apos;s Nest in Beijing, the Gateway of India, the world&apos;s tallest building the Burj Khalifa, the Ancient Citadel of Erbil in Kurdistan, Table Mountain, the Bosphorus Bridge, the Eiffel Tower, the Brandenburg Gate, the UK Houses of Parliament, Buckingham palace, the Empire State Building, Niagara Falls and Los Angeles airport.

They have proven time and time again that if you believe in something strongly enough, you can achieve amazing things. These stories aren&apos;t unique, this is happening all over the world.&quot;  Earth Hour has its share of critics, who say it symbolises environmentalism as living in the dark. Author George Marshall wrote in 2009:  &quot;Asking people to sit in the dark plays very well to a widely held prejudice that &apos;the greens&apos; want us all to go back to living in caves.&quot;  This year, Prof Bjorn Lomborg, a prominent critic of the economic cost of dealing with climate change, has warned the gesture will do little to help the planet and gives people the wrong impression about how to address climate issues:  &quot;Global warming is a real problem, but Earth Hour is not the answer. Taken to its logical conclusion, if switching the lights off for one hour is a good idea, why not for all the other 8,759 hours of the year?             Some energy experts have also said that Earth Hour could result in an increase in carbon emissions and place great strain on electricity grids. Fossil-fuelled power stations could be required to fire up quickly when everyone turns their lights back on, &quot;rendering all good intentions useless at a flick of a switch&quot;. But WWF maintains Earth Hour is not about saving energy but raising awareness. Part of this year&apos;s campaign is &quot;I Will If You Will&quot; \u2013 where you can pledge to take action beyond Earth Hour and get your friends, family and colleagues involved. WWF also wants to spread the word using social media. Earth Hour events around the world Organisers in the United Kingdom hope to break the record of 7 million people who took part last year. Landmarks that will turn off their lights include Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament, Trafalgar Square, BFI Imax, the London Eye, the Gherkin, Edinburgh castle, Brighton Pier, Westminster abbey, Durham cathedral, Old Trafford, Canterbury cathedral, Windsor Castle and Tewkesbury abbey. WWF-UK is hosting a night at the Southbank in London that will stream live content from around the world and feature a live acoustic performance by the band McFly, who have done the Harlem Shake in panda onesies to launch the campaign. Celebrity chefs including Raymond Blanc, Gordon Ramsay and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have created special recipes for families to prepare and eat by candlelight, and WWF has teamed up with a Kevin McCloud, Miranda Richardson and Alistair McGowan, who have recorded readings of Rudyard Kipling&apos;s famous Just So stories.            Earth Hour organisers and WWF affiliate Fundaci\u00f3n Vida Silvestre is encouraging participants in Argentina to support a senate bill to make Banco Namuncur\u00e1 (Burdwood) a marine protected area. If passed, the 34,000-km sq area will raise the protected area of Argentina&apos;s seas from 1% to 4%. In 2007, 2.2 million people took part in the first Earth Hour in Sydney. This year, some of Australia&apos;s most famous landmarks will glow green to symbolise their commitment to renewable energy. Sydney Opera House, the Arts Centre in Melbourne and Council House in Perth will be all be powered by 100% clean energy and organisers are asking Australians to &quot;switch off for good by switching on to renewable energy&quot;. Towns and suburbs with the highest number of pledges will win solar power systems for their councils from Sungevity. Community events are also being planned, from stargazing Sydney to night runs in Queensland and BBQ bushwalk in Canberra. In Botswana, former president Festus Mogae has marked a four-year commitment to plant 1 million indigenous trees with the planting of 100,000 trees in Goodhope, a severely degraded area in southern Botswana. The CN Tower in Toronto, Canada will dim its lights for the sixth year running \u2013 the city was the second ever to back the campaign. Vancouver was named this week as the winner of the Earth Hour city challenge, for its &quot;overall holistic and strategic approach to climate action&quot;. It beat 16 other finalists including Sydney, New Dehli, San Francisco and Olso. The Indian subcontinent will switch off the Gateway of India lights at the same time as four villages in Madhya Pradesh receive solar lanterns, the first form of energy they will ever use. WWF says Earth Hour will be the first piece of environmental action taking place in Palestine since its UN recognition as a state. Earth Hour is being coordinated from both Gaza and the West Bank, with switch-off events taking place at Al-Jundi and Palestine squares, in Gaza City, and the cities of Nablus, Bethlehem, and Ramallah. Russia will switch off the lights at around 100 landmarks across 50 cities and towns. Following a successful petition last year that was instrumental in the passing of a law to protect the seas from oil pollution, this year WWF Earth Hour Russia is turning its attention to forest protection. Organisers are on their way to securing more than 100,000 signatures for a petition to change forest legislation. The amendments would reinstate a ban on industrial logging and protect almost 18% of all Russian forests \u2013 equal to an area of land twice the size of France. In Tunisia, which is taking part in Earth Hour for the first time this year, 11 cities and towns will turn their lights off, with the main event taking place at Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the site of the initial protests that sparked the Arab Spring. It will be attended by Tunisia&apos;s president, Moncef Marzouki. In Uganda, where 6,000 hectares of deforestation occurs every month, WWF Uganda is aiming to fill close to 2,700 hectares of degraded land with at least 500,000 indigenous trees as part of Earth Hour 2013. In the United States, New York city landmarks taking place include Times Square, the Rockefeller centre and the Empire State Building. The bright lights of the Las Vegas strip will also go dark for the hour, as well as Los Angeles airport and Niagara Falls. \u2022 Follow Earth Hour live"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/mar/22/rugby-world", "sentences": ["&quot;There&apos;s already a professional league in Japan and there are opportunities in Hong Kong or Singapore to put franchises in."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T16:43:57Z", "title": "Times are changing as the world discovers a passion for rugby union | Robert Kitson", "tags": ["Rugby union", "Sport"], "article": "Along with many other traditional pursuits, the world of rugby is hurtling towards a future it can barely comprehend. At the Hong Kong Sevens, Kenya are genuine threats and Brazil are appearing for the first time. A 40,000 crowd watched Madagascar beat Namibia last year, with 15-a-side interest also rising in Thailand, the Philippines, Moldova and Venezuela. Afghanistan now has a national team and Guangzhou in China is due to host a leg of the women&apos;s world sevens next week. And on it goes. Welcome to a sport exploding in myriad different directions. In Russia there is such a well-established, professional league that players relocating to the English Premiership have to take a pay cut. In the United States the sport has obtained &quot;varsity&quot; status which means college rugby scholarships are now on offer. Several South Africans have already packed their bags; you suspect one or two British teenagers may also fancy the frat pack experience. A souped-up American national side really would make multi-national sponsors sit up. If they prefer, they could head for Medell\u00edn, Colombia. &quot;We&apos;ve had incredible stories coming out of Colombia,&quot; says Mark Egan, the International Rugby Board&apos;s head of development and performance. &quot;They&apos;ve got 10,000 registered players and the government are now investing heavily in rugby. They see it as a fantastic sport for young children and they&apos;ve brought it into young offenders&apos; institutions. In Medell\u00edn they&apos;ve built a rugby centre with two artificial pitches, changing rooms, the lot.&quot; All a long way from home? Not really. One rung below the Six Nations, a hugely competitive European Nations Cup has just finished. While Wales were stampeding to their title, Georgia confirmed their rising status by securing the second-tier crown. Their New Zealand coach, Milton Haig, believes good progress is being made: &quot;I&apos;m confident that in the next six to 12 months we could, if we get an opportunity, put the frighteners up a tier-one nation.&quot; The word &quot;if&quot; is the crucial one. Exciting new markets or not, the Six Nations still clings to its old upstairs-downstairs structure, which means Georgia can only hope to play the grandees above them every four years at a World Cup. Imagine if this year&apos;s wooden spooners, France, had to go to Tbilisi for a mandatory play-off next month to retain their championship status? The commercial implications of defeat might scare the daylights out of the major unions but imagine the frenzy of interest elsewhere. &quot;We know Georgia is a union which can perform if it gets the right investment,&quot; says Egan, who visited Tbilisi last autumn with the ex-All Black captain Graham Mourie to meet the new Georgian prime minister, who has overseen a \u00a320m investment in 11 new high-performance centres around his rugby-mad country. In 20 years&apos; time we may all be wondering how the closed-shop arrangements endured for so long. This, however, is not a vision shared by the Six Nations&apos; chief executive, John Feehan. As he tots up the championship&apos;s soaring global viewing figures, he finds it hard to believe anyone would wish to tinker with such a winning formula. &quot;To be brutally honest, I couldn&apos;t see a change in the next 10 years,&quot; predicts Feehan. &quot;You&apos;ve got to look at what you&apos;ve got and at the moment we&apos;ve got an extraordinarily successful tournament. &quot;You change it at your peril. We&apos;ll never say never but at the moment I think there is a big gap between the bottom Six Nations side and the next-best team.&quot; The evidence, however, is less conclusive than it was. Georgia lost only 15-6 to Scotland at the 2011 World Cup and, by common consent, they and their rivals are improving. Last week Georgia and Romania shared a 9-9 draw in Bucharest and the Lelos only sneaked home 17-13 against a competitive Belgium side in Brussels. The latter were a lowly 58th in the world a decade ago, while Romania are now coached by Welshman Lyn Howells. Of the \u00a310m per year invested by the IRB through their strategic investment programme, some \u00a3500,000 apiece goes to boosting standards in Romania, Georgia and Russia, but Feehan makes clear the Six Nations is not a charity. &quot;I don&apos;t think putting Romania or Georgia into the Six Nations would necessarily be good for them, or the competition. Quite frankly, the IRB has never contributed to the Six Nations&apos; success. It&apos;s owned and run by the six unions.&quot; More encouraging, at least, is the fixture schedule for the 2015 World Cup which, thank goodness, will be fairer than any of its predecessors. The leading nations \u2013 and broadcasters \u2013 have finally agreed to midweek dates for the top sides, ensuring the minnows will have similar rest periods to everyone else. For countries like Russia, it is something to cling to. &quot;We are ambitious to be a major rugby nation but there is no pathway for us to go up,&quot; says Russia&apos;s chief executive, Howard Thomas. &quot;I&apos;m a huge Six Nations fan, but the world has got to ask: &apos;Is it good for the global game for it to stay as it is?&apos; We need to have that debate. At some stage an established side will be beaten and people will say: &apos;This tournament doesn&apos;t represent the best six teams in Europe any more.&apos;&quot; In the meantime, more cross-border club fixtures is one obvious compromise, although that raises its own issues. It takes eight hours to fly from London to Siberia via Moscow if, say, Saracens were drawn against Russia&apos;s current champions, based in Krasnoyarsk. Then again, the world grows ever smaller. Last month Leicester organised a training camp for youngsters, not in Market Harborough but Kuala Lumpur. Asia, with a World Cup in Japan in 2019, looks ready for major growth. &quot;Super Rugby may look to expand its horizons in 2015 and the Asian market is on its doorstep,&quot; predicts Egan. &quot;There&apos;s already a professional league in Japan and there are opportunities in Hong Kong or Singapore to put franchises in. There are plenty of options to transform domestic competition models. Over the next five years that&apos;s where the game is going to have to look at itself.&quot; Within that timescale, too, rugby sevens will have featured at the 2016 Olympics. Marcos Paixao&apos;s modest home in Rio&apos;s Contagalo favela is a long way from the game&apos;s cosy heartlands but, as the IRB&apos;s Total Rugby programme highlighted this month, that is no longer a barrier to oval-ball passion. Marcos and his three brothers were introduced to the sport as part of a special project to help the city&apos;s poorest kids and now belong among the 15,000 active rugby players in their football-obsessed country. Of course there are still pitfalls. The rise of sevens can have a knock-on effect, particularly in China where funding for fifteens has suffered. There is a global audience out there, however, craving a piece of the action. &quot;There&apos;s still a huge challenge to bridge the gap but we&apos;re doing as much as we can,&quot; says Egan. &quot;There are also 205 national Olympic committees now interested in rugby as well.&quot; The future may arrive sooner than we think."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/ig-group-holdings", "sentences": ["The majority of its 1,000 staff works in the company&apos;s London offices, but international secondments are available to one of 15 global offices, including Tokyo, Singapore, Melbourne and Johannesburg."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-22T17:19:25Z", "title": "IG Group Holdings", "tags": ["Employers list"], "article": "    A member of the FTSE 250 and listed on the London stock exchange, the IG Group is a world-leading provider of online financial derivatives, including spreadbets and contracts for difference (CFDs).

He is said to have been paid just five guineas for the design, launched in 1933, which he continued to adapt for decades as new lines and stations were introduced, even after he became a teacher at the London School of Printing. His last published version was in 1960, but he later broke with London Underground enraged at other designers meddling with his work.

When he was elected to the Elys\u00e9e, the economic and social crisis in France was already dire, but he bet publicly on an upturn by this year. Bad luck. For all his government oratory and new regulations, unemployment keeps rising, the goal to downsize public debt to 3% of GDP has been abandoned, fiscal pressure has reached unprecedented heights, and more cuts have to be made in public spending. The president&apos;s most symbolic measure, the 75% tax on the very high salaries, has been cancelled as illegal, only to be replaced soon by a 66% tax, which irritates the rich without satisfying their enemies. For long the most depressed nation in Europe, the French are reluctantly bracing for worse. But they don&apos;t seem to think their president and his prime minister are up to the job. Hollande&apos;s and Jean-Marc Ayrault&apos;s approval rates have plummeted to an all-time low after 10 months in office \u2013 about 30%. At the same time, Nicolas Sarkozy&apos;s star is rising again \u2013 at least among conservatives. Not only does his wife, Carla Bruni, sing his praises in a new album, but the former president has taken advantage of the internal fights within his own party to appear as the only possible candidate for the next presidential contest in 2017. Unable to stick to his vow of political abstinence, he has been criticising and mocking his successor in front of his many visitors as if there were not another four years to go. Last week, two thunderstorms hit the French political landscape right and left. Sarkozy was formally placed under investigation on charges of exploiting the frailty of the country&apos;s richest woman to finance his 2007 campaign. Contesting the independence of the investigative judge, his friends and allies indignantly railed against what they see as a manoeuvre to prevent him from returning fully to political life. Sarkozy will appeal, but could well be entangled in a legal process that might take years to unravel. There are other matters in which the former president, no longer protected by immunity, may have to provide answers. Last week, the Paris flat of Christine Lagarde, his former finance minister and current IMF chief, was raided by the police as part of an investigation into a huge compensation deal granted a few years ago to a controversial business tycoon. Sarkozy is rumoured to have favoured the deal. On the left, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac, the budget minister, one of the few stars of the government \u2013 brilliant, eloquent and brutal as befitted the man in charge of imposing harsh cuts on his colleagues and higher taxes on the French \u2013 had to hand in his resignation. He has been accused of having illegally held bank accounts in Switzerland and in Singapore, allegedly to hide money from the French tax authorities. Unbearable suspicion for anyone in public office. So, for the champion of fiscal duress, the vilifier of tax exiles, the boot seems to be pretty much on the other foot. For all his denials, he had to quit when the public prosecutor&apos;s office in Paris launched a formal investigation. The Elys\u00e9e was obviously prepared. Bernard Cazeneuve, formerly minister for European affairs, was immediately put in charge. For all its claims of moral integrity, the Socialist party has been harmed, and the president weakened. There is growing criticism, even inside the Elys\u00e9e, about Hollande&apos;s indecisiveness, his tendency to listen to everybody without speaking his mind, his obsession \u2013 dating back to his days as party boss \u2013 with trying to placate all sides rather than impose a strategy. A divided majority, the main opposition party with no real leader, scandals hitting the political and financial elites in a time of economic and social hardship: a year away from local and European elections, Marine Le Pen&apos;s extreme right Front National is a clear winner. The Elys\u00e9e is worried. On Thursday, Hollande will give a long television interview to try and convince the French that, for all their doubts, he has a clear, decisive vision of what to do for the country. A few weeks ago, the concern among his advisers was that the president was not speaking enough. Now that he does every other day on all issues \u2013 like his predecessor, Sarkozy, but in a more normal manner \u2013 the issue is that the French may no longer want to listen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/25/baroness-sue-campbell-uk-sport", "sentences": ["Campbell recalls the &quot;amazing excitement&quot; of being part of the delegation in Singapore in 2005 that won the 2012 Games for London and the &quot;huge significance&quot; of the breakthrough in Beijing, where up to 14 UK Sport staff slept on the floor of a city centre apartment by night and watched the medals roll in by day."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-25T14:50:24Z", "title": "Baroness Sue Campbell: 'I really believe sport changes lives'", "tags": ["UK Sport", "Olympic legacy", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "article": "There is an Italian cafe in Islington that probably deserves British sport&apos;s version of a blue plaque. It was there, a decade ago, that two of its unsung heroes sat down to set the tone for all that followed at the Beijing and London Olympics. Baroness Sue Campbell, then the newly appointed &quot;reform chair&quot; of the body that distributes lottery and exchequer cash to Olympic athletes, met over supper with Peter Keen, who had helped put British Cycling on the path to Olympic glory, but was by then working for Lucozade, to persuade him to take on the challenge. &quot;I told him I had a dream. I wanted to produce the best high-performance sports system in the world here, in Britain. But I said I couldn&apos;t do it without him. He didn&apos;t want to do it at first but a week later he rang and said: &apos;I&apos;m in.&apos;&quot; Between them they put in place the building blocks for the journey from 10th in the medal table in Athens to fourth in Beijing and then third in London. The pair had met while conducting a government review of elite sport that was to form the template for UK Sport&apos;s uncompromising mission. &quot;I was very impressed with this mind of Peter&apos;s. A blue sky thinker, a visionary, who was very clear about what needed to happen. He was applying what he knew about cycling across the system,&quot; says Campbell, who is following Keen out of the door after he stood down as performance director before the London Games. While the 10 years that followed would be far from smooth \u2013 punctuated by furious rows over budgets and the sort of petty turf wars that habitually hobble British sports administration \u2013 the upward trajectory was set. If the first major step in that transformation had been John Major&apos;s introduction of Lottery funding in the wake of the humiliation of Atlanta in 1996, where Britain won a solitary gold and finished 36th in the medal table, the second was the overhaul of UK Sport instigated by Campbell. The last piece in the jigsaw was arguably winning the right in 2005 to host the Games and the funding boost that followed, allowing it to pour in \u00a3312m over the London cycle and \u00a3347m in the four years to Rio 2016. Despite Campbell last month being named one of the 100 most powerful women in the UK by Radio 4&apos;s Woman&apos;s Hour, most of the fans who roared Chris Hoy, Jessica Ennis and Nicola Adams to glory would walk straight past her in the street. But her part in their success cannot be overstated. Now contemplating the end of her 10-year tenure \u2013 she will step down in May \u2013 the redoubtable Campbell has spent her life combining sport, education and the charitable sector. A former PE teacher, then sports science lecturer, she was the chief executive of the National Coaching Foundation for a decade and then the chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust for a further 10 years. Over the past decade, she poured all that experience and missionary zeal into revolutionising the elite sport system in this country and \u2013 through her continued chairmanship of the YST \u2013 banging the drum for the role sport can plan in schools and wider society. Campbell has ruffled feathers along the way but undoubtedly deserves the plaudits that flowed her way at a valedictory dinner last week. In her YST office in a corner of Loughborough University&apos;s &quot;SportPark&quot;, the flakes of snow tumbling past the windows serve as reminders that the giddy days of August and September 2012 are now long gone. She recalls how the foundations for that success were laid much earlier. When she was appointed as a &quot;reform chair&quot; of UK Sport, formerly the Sports Council of Great Britain, in 2003 she walked into an organisation that was &quot;dysfunctional&quot; with &quot;major staffing issues&quot; and a serious identity crisis. &quot;It was a very typical public sector culture \u2013 very concerned with process and not with output. We had endless committees and everything took a very long time.&quot; Having overhauled the management team and empowered Keen to spread the gospel that had helped transform Britain&apos;s cyclists into potential world beaters to other sports, she also set about changing their culture. Investment was remorselessly channelled at those sports and athletes most likely to win medals and efforts made to shake up the sometimes cosy and clubbable world of sports administration. &quot;At times people have felt the no-compromise approach is harsh. But it&apos;s enabled people to really understand what elite sport is about,&quot; says Campbell. &quot;It isn&apos;t about giving everybody a chance. It is about homing in on those who can make it and helping them be the best they can be.&quot; In 2005, Keen and Campbell walked into Gordon Brown&apos;s office and told him that they could come at least fourth in the medal table at London 2012 but that they would need commensurate funding. &quot;In that 2005 meeting with government, we said we would win exactly 65 medals. It&apos;s there in the document,&quot; she says. &quot;We could justify that by saying that, in order to get those medals, we need these medallists and each of them cost this. Here&apos;s your bill. This is a business model, it&apos;s not an estimate.&quot; Once the totals were totted up at the closing ceremony, their prediction of 65 proved bang on. Campbell, who was made a crossbench peer in 2003, has had to fight many battles along the way to protect her &quot;Formula One&quot; high-performance system. She recalls an early skirmish with Tessa Jowell over extending the four-year funding horizon to eight; then a post-Beijing battle with Jowell&apos;s successor Andy Burnham to fill a \u00a3100m hole in the budget that left her &quot;pacing the house in despair&quot; in the early hours of the morning. More recently, she has seen off a proposed merger with the grassroots sport agency Sport England as part of Cameron&apos;s damp-squib &quot;bonfire of the quangos&quot; that she feared would dull UK Sport&apos;s focus. &quot;I don&apos;t like conflict, believe it or not. My sister wonders how I can do this job because I shy away from it. I know people who have seen me at work will think that&apos;s a complete fib,&quot; she laughs. &quot;But my father used to say that if you don&apos;t stand for something you stand for nothing. And my job is to do what&apos;s right for sport. I might not be the easiest character to work with but I will fight and fight and fight for what is right.&quot; More recently, her success in helping to persuade even Michael Gove of the merits of ring-fencing investment in school sport must stand among her biggest achievements. &quot;People often refer to the fact I&apos;m incredibly resilient. You can knock me down but I&apos;ll come back, I&apos;m like a bouncing ball. The mission is worth the fight,&quot; says the 64-year-old. The highs have been more than worth the lows. Campbell recalls the &quot;amazing excitement&quot; of being part of the delegation in Singapore in 2005 that won the 2012 Games for London and the &quot;huge significance&quot; of the breakthrough in Beijing, where up to 14 UK Sport staff slept on the floor of a city centre apartment by night and watched the medals roll in by day. &quot;At one point you were pinching yourself and thinking &apos;crikey, it&apos;s happening too soon&apos;. It was a bit like watching the flowers come out in springtime,&quot; she says. But she could not have scripted a denouement like London. From carrying the Olympic torch through her home village to sitting beside the prime minister as the medals rained in, and naturally taking the opportunity to lobby him to guarantee UK Sport&apos;s funding to Rio 2016, it was quite a postscript. &quot;There is so much that elite sport gives this country. I&apos;ve never felt this nation like it was in the summer. There was a sense of national pride. We actually believed that if you stick us against the rest of the world, we&apos;re pretty good,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ll never live through moments like that again. It was extraordinary. I was proud of the system, I was proud of the athletes. But I was so proud that when they sat in front of the media they projected the thing I value most about sport \u2013 its values. Humility, hard work, bouncing back from setbacks. I really believe sport changes lives.&quot; Campbell says you&apos;d have to be a &quot;pretty strange creature&quot; not to believe in the rationale for public investment in elite sport after London 2012, and is convinced it left politicians of all hues convinced of the need to protect it, even in austere times. But her experiences with the International Inspiration programme that have left her office studded with mementoes from around the world have left her convinced that we are still failing at home to practise what we preach abroad about sport&apos;s wider role. &quot;We&apos;re still not as convinced about sport as a tool for development within this country as we are abroad. We have used sport to tackle HIV, community cohesion, gang warfare \u2013 it has changed people&apos;s lives,&quot; she says. &quot;But we somehow don&apos;t quite believe it still. This notion of using sport as a tool to tackle wider social issues \u2013 at a political level people still aren&apos;t convinced it can drive massive social change.&quot; It is a mission that she is unlikely to abandon given her myriad remaining roles within sport, but she insists that, as far as UK Sport goes, she leaves the organisation \u2013 and British Olympic sport \u2013 in good hands. &quot;That&apos;s the thing for me. London was wonderful. But that would mean nothing to me if the system wasn&apos;t strong,&quot; she says, refusing to turn wistful. &quot;Yes, we can get better. But I&apos;ll be leaving them on an upward trajectory, and that&apos;s really exciting. I&apos;ll be watching on as they go on and do even greater things in Rio.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/27/qantas-emirates-deal-approved", "sentences": ["Under the partnership Qantas will use Dubai rather than Singapore as the stopover point for its flights to London."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-27T05:26:55Z", "title": "Qantas and Emirates deal approved", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Air transport", "Business", "Australia news", "New Zealand", "United Arab Emirates", "World news", "Qantas"], "article": "Australia&apos;s competition regulator has given the airlines Qantas and Emirates final approval to form a five-year global alliance, while requiring that they continue to compete with each other on flights between Australian and New Zealand.

He said:  Management said it felt the Asian business could double every three to six years, depending on market conditions, but stopped short of issuing new targets until the previous targets had been met. The market reacted positively despite the drop in 2012 of sales in Malaysia, the focus of the previous investor day. However, in our view, IFRS profits per customer in 2012 (\u00a3278 for Singapore and \u00a3144 for Indonesia) are inconsistent with a mass market business. The group is achieving very high growth rates in bancassurance in Asia, but we think growth in the agency &quot;sweet spot&quot; is much weaker and that sales have been inflated by cross-selling to existing customers. With the stock at 13 times PE we think that local banks may be a better investment.

Gender &amp; Development is a unique journal, aiming to support development workers to integrate gender justice and women&apos;s rights into their work. It focuses on innovative issues ranging from food, working with men for gender equality, climate change, and the gendered implications of the economic crisis. The journal publishes the experience of policymakers, practitioners, and women&apos;s rights activists, many of whom have never previously published their work.  After studying english at Cambridge, Caroline trained as a periodical journalist at City University, London, but spent too much time actually doing journalism and not enough time studying. She opted not to stay in London to re-sit her end-of-year exams, in favour of moving to Lesotho. There, she lived and worked as a journalist for four years, setting up and project managing a UNICEF (United Nations Children&apos;s Fund)-sponsored popular women&apos;s education/media project, Shoeshoe. It gave her carte blanche to be very inquisitive about the realities of life in Lesotho, and she researched and wrote on a range of issues affecting women in Lesotho, including the HIV crisis, and the impact on marriages of men being made redundant from the South African goldmines.  Caroline joined Oxfam in 1993, and has spent time as a gender policy and programme adviser, and as a policy researcher, as well as editing the journal. In 2006 she finished a PhD, which examined the impact on women in slum areas of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, of a microfinance project aiming to &apos;empower&apos; them. She chose this focus having married an Ethiopian and decided to find out more about the country - and did her PhD fieldwork with weaving communities in Addis with her newborn twins in tow. Caroline is a research fellow of International Gender Studies at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford, and also lectures at Oxford Brookes University.

The two men were attending a ceremony to launch construction, on the Pakistani side, of a new pipeline that will funnel natural gas from Iran&apos;s South Pars field in the Gulf to energy-starved Pakistani businesses, car drivers and consumers from the end of 2014. For the smiling Ahmadinejad, the \u00a35bn pipeline serves several key purposes. It will produce hard currency for Iran&apos;s hard-pressed economy. It goes some way to mitigating historical suspicions that have separated Shia Iran and predominantly Sunni Muslim Pakistan. It boosts Tehran&apos;s regional influence. But more than that, the pipeline will help break the sanctions stranglehold on Iran&apos;s energy sector imposed by the US and western allies concerned about Tehran&apos;s nuclear-related activities. &quot;I&apos;m confident that no foreign element will be able to affect our historic and brotherly relations,&quot; the Iranian president said. The pipeline was a symbol of the two countries&apos; independence from &quot;those who only aim to humiliate us, and break us apart, and dominate us ... With natural gas, you cannot make atomic bombs. That&apos;s why they should have no excuse to oppose this pipeline.&quot; The revival of the much-delayed project, and the timing of the high-profile joint ceremony attended by diplomats from Arab states, appears, in part at least, to be the product of canny calculations by Zardari ahead of Pakistan&apos;s national elections on 11 May. The Pakistani president, whose own five-year term ends in September, wants to be seen to be doing something about chronic energy shortages that bring daily power cuts and caused a nationwide blackout last month. But by courting Ahmadinejad, Zardari was also sending a pointed signal to the US government. Pakistan&apos;s long-running, ambivalent relationship with its principal financial backer and strategic ally has been more hate than love in recent times. Strong anti-American feeling, outraged by the 2011 commando raid that found and killed Osama bin Laden on Pakistani territory and by lethal Afghan border incidents involving Pakistani and American troops, is being stoked on an almost weekly basis by US drone attacks. US commentators describe the relationship as &quot;toxic&quot;. In this poisonous context, Zardari&apos;s move was seen as a deliberate attempt to emphasise Islamabad&apos;s growing freedom of action as the American regional presence declines with next year&apos;s withdrawal from Afghanistan. Anthony Skinner, of the British-based Maplecroft risks consultancy, said: &quot;The Pakistani government wants to show it is willing to take foreign policy decisions that defy the US ... The pipeline not only caters to Pakistan&apos;s energy needs but also lodged brownie points with the many critics of the US among the electorate.&quot; Senior Pakistani officials point to a string of decisions by Zardari designed not only to loosen Washington&apos;s suffocating embrace but also keep India, Pakistan&apos;s major regional rival and sometime foe, at bay. These include his collaboration with David Cameron and Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, in a trilateral process on Afghanistan&apos;s future that has excluded Delhi. The most recent meeting was held at Chequers last month. Ignoring US and Indian concerns, Zardari has also held out his hand to China, recently transferring management of the highly strategic port of Gwadar from a Singapore company to a Chinese one. &quot;China&apos;s presence in the Gwadar port at the mouth of the Arabian Sea will deter India from carrying out any action planned against Pakistan,&quot; Chinese state media dutifully noted. All this, coupled with his success in holding Pakistan&apos;s government together, against all the odds, and presiding over what in May will be the first civilian government-to-civilian government democratic transition in the country&apos;s history, has boosted Zardari&apos;s stock, opening the way for a possible bid for a second term. &quot;For someone who was not trained as a politician, Zardari has seen everybody off,&quot; a senior Pakistani official said. &quot;He&apos;s got the better of all of them.&quot; The Obama administration, meanwhile, looks on balefully, struggling unsuccessfully to conceal its displeasure and resist the temptation to hit back with sanctions. Victoria Nuland, the state department spokeswoman, said: &quot;If this deal is finalised for a proposed Iran-Pakistan pipeline, it would raise serious concerns under our Iran Sanctions Act. We&apos;ve made that absolutely clear to our Pakistani counterparts.&quot; The US is urging alternative energy solutions on Islamabad, including a notional and, given the security issues involved, rather fanciful plan for a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to India via Afghanistan and Pakistan. Washington has also offered help with new hydroelectric dams and other projects. The state department&apos;s Patrick Ventrell said: &quot;We really think there are other long-term solutions ... It&apos;s in their best interest to avoid any sanctionable activity.&quot; But the senior Pakistani official dismissed such talk as so much hot air. &quot;Hillary Clinton came and offered to help us. But they haven&apos;t done anything.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/mar/28/damaged-undersea-cable-internet-disruption", "sentences": ["&quot;Depending on where that is, it can take a long time.&quot;  The predecessor to this undersea cable, SEA-ME-WE-3, has had a service interruption since January after being damaged in the waters of Singapore.", "Repairs to the cord have been impeded because of delays in obtaining the licensing from the Singapore government allowing it to be fixed."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-28T22:07:53Z", "title": "Damaged undersea internet cable causes widespread global service disruption", "tags": ["Internet", "Cybercrime", "Egypt", "Africa", "India", "Pakistan", "Technology"], "article": "A cut to the largest internet cable that connects Europe and Asia caused severe service disruption that stretched from from Africa to Pakistan.

These internet customers get most of their internet service routed from Europe and the US and when the cable was cut, some lost internet connectivity entirely.  Cowie said: &quot;When a cable like that gets cut, a lot of the paths between networks get radically changed and we see that within a few seconds.&quot;  Seacom, a submarine cable network that provides broadband to Africa and owns the cut cable, said Wednesday that the cable had suffered a cut off the coast of Egypt. Following reports that three men had been arrested for cutting the cable, Seacom said Thursday that it could not confirm what was responsible for the damage. The disruption comes days after reports of what some touted as the &quot;biggest cyber attack in history.&quot; This attack occurred when a group, reported by the New York Times to be hosting site Cyberbunker, launched a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack against spam-filtering company Spamhaus.  &quot;The impacts are like night and day compared to this DDoS attack, which was a good story, but really didn&apos;t cause a widespread global impact,&quot; Cowie said.

A seven-hour search of my home by six detectives was followed by several more hours of interrogation at a Herefordshire police station. My alleged offence resulted from my book The Irish War, a work in which I had quoted from a classified document, without harm to national security.

When I asked the prosecutor&apos;s office why \u2013 since I now wanted my day in court \u2013 no one could say. The reason was another official secret. But Lewis was on the right track. In its 13 years in office, New Labour invented an estimated 4,200-plus new criminal offences, including one of attempting to access the wreck of the Titanic without government permission. I concluded that the news department of the British embassy in Washington had taken note of what Lewis wrote and routinely reported the bad news back to the Foreign Office in London. There, Blair&apos;s spin-conscious team might just have noticed that a political cause celebre was building up in a very embarrassing place. The case was promptly dropped in circumstances that took my defence team entirely by surprise.

King, who has headed the FTSE 100 supermarket chain for nine years, is a motor racing fan and there has been regular speculation that he could be a candidate to take over the wheel of Formula One. &quot;I&apos;ve no idea whether the boss of a company like Sainsbury&apos;s could do my job. Maybe he could, &quot; said Ecclestone. King recently drove into a storm of controversy when it came to light that five brands with business ties to Sainsbury&apos;s sponsor the racing career of his son Jordan. Last year Jordan King finished second in the Formula Renault Northern European championship and this year will race in European Formula 3, a junior series two steps below Formula One. King has insisted he has no plans to leave Sainsbury&apos;s but the speculation about him joining Formula One has been fuelled by questions over Ecclestone&apos;s future. Ecclestone is 82 and no successor has been formally groomed to take over from him. He is also the subject of an alleged bribery investigation in Germany. Forumla One&apos;s former chairman, German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky, was found guilty in June last year of receiving $44m in 2006 (then \u00a331m) from Ecclestone and his family trust in return for allegedly steering the sale of the sport to current owner, the private equity firm CVC. German prosecutors believe Ecclestone favoured CVC since it had agreed to retain him as Formula One&apos;s chief executive. Ecclestone denied this and said Gribkowsky threatened to make false allegations about his tax affairs to HM Revenue &amp; Customs if he did not pay the money. Ecclestone has not been charged with any wrongdoing and CVC has said it expects his name to be cleared by October. CVC has given Ecclestone its full support and the only sign of succession planning so far has been its hiring of headhunting firm Egon Zehnder. As part of CVC&apos;s stalled plan to float Formula One on the Singapore stock exchange last year Egon Zehnder produced a confidential shortlist of potential replacements forEcclestone but none has been engaged. This is not the first time that a retailer has been linked with a top job at Formula One. Former Marks &amp; Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose was tipped to take over as chairman in 2011 after Gribkowsky was arrested. However, he ended up being replaced by CVC co-founder Donald Mackenzie. Ecclestone is needed now more than ever as Formula One faces a bumpy financial road. Spanish team HRT closed its doors due to funding problems at the end of last year. The average annual budget of aFormula One team is around $180m (\u00a3120m) and the economic downturn has made it harder to cover costs with sponsorship. Vodafone, one of the highest profile and longest running F1 sponsors, revealed last month that it is pulling out of the sport from the end of this season to concentrate on smaller projects.

The children are working at various levels of difficulty, with most practising multiplying two-digit numbers by fractions, while a more advanced group do exercises on ratio and proportion. But in a few years&apos; time, will children of this age have already mastered these concepts? This is the hope of ministers, who are seeking to introduce a new national curriculum in England that promotes &quot;higher standards&quot; by introducing &quot;harder&quot; concepts earlier in children&apos;s school lives. The idea is that England &quot;raises its game&quot; to compete with nations such as Singapore and South Korea where, it is said, more is expected of children in classrooms. Whether it will work is one of the biggest questions behind the national curriculum review. The consultation period ends on 16 April, with the new curriculum due to be finalised by autumn and taught to millions of pupils from September 2014. This was one of the debates that triggered the explosive row late last month, when the education secretary, Michael Gove, rounded on 100 academics who had signed a letter arguing that the new draft curriculum was asking &quot;too much, too soon&quot; of children. Among other things, he accused them of opposing children being taught to spell correctly, &quot;use a wider vocabulary and learn their times tables&quot;. Low expectations But is Gove right to suggest that those who are worried about the national curriculum becoming harder at a younger age simply have low expectations of children? Under the planned new curriculum, in history, children are to be introduced to the concepts of &quot;civilisation&quot;, &quot;nation&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; at the ages of six and seven. And in stipulations that some say verge on self-parody, key stage 1 pupils are supposed to start grasping the influence of the Romantic poet Christina Rossetti and of the scientists Michael Faraday and William Harvey, while for key stage 2 (age seven-11), they must study &quot;the heptarchy&quot;. In English, spelling lists imply that those aged six should have mastered words including &quot;Tuesday&quot; and &quot;astronaut&quot; and be aware of words where the &quot;f&quot; sound is spelt &quot;ph&quot;, such as &quot;phonics&quot; . By age nine, they should be able to spell &quot;spontaneous&quot;, &quot;scheme&quot; and &quot;antique&quot;; and to understand the difference between &quot;affect&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;. At age 11, they should have mastered the subjunctive. In maths, pupils are to be expected to add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions by the time they leave primary school, a requirement that does not feature in the current curriculum; to know up to their 12-times table by year 4 (currently, it is up to their 10-times tables by year 6); and to be able to do long division in primary school. So is England on the verge of a transformation in standards, as pupils master key concepts and skills earlier? Karen Mills, head of Ravenswood primary, has her doubts. An accountant, who switched to teaching in 1997, her concerns focus on maths. While she does not fault the government&apos;s aspiration to raise standards in all subjects, in relation to maths she says: &quot;Making children study things earlier will not, in itself, make them more intelligent \u2026 The danger is that we move children on to &apos;harder&apos; topics before they have the depth of understanding they need to grasp the concepts. &quot;Year 5 children are supposed to be using square and cube numbers. The assumption in the new curriculum is that they are ready for this, but many of them do not really understand the number system. If we try to force them forward on to new material, we are going to lose half of the class.&quot; This point is made forcefully in a joint submission to a consultation on the first draft of the primary curriculum last year by the Mathematical Association and Association of Teachers of Mathematics. &quot;The expectations set out in the draft programme of study are too high,&quot; it says. &quot;There is a rush to introduce formal representations, which contradicts research evidence that emphasises the importance of developing secure conceptual understanding.&quot; It adds: &quot;Many of the expectations for upper key stage 2 include things which are best left to secondary [school], [such as] formal algebra [and calculation of volume].&quot; Supporters of the review disagree with the MA and ATM, arguing that other countries \u2013 Singapore is the most frequently cited \u2013 do introduce &quot;harder&quot; material earlier. But the evidence seems mixed. A report on primary maths provision for the Labour government in 2008 by Sir Peter Williams, now vice-president of the Royal Society, noted witheringly that &quot;it is clear from international comparisons that in this country we are prone to accelerate steps in our educational processes to ever earlier ages, contrary to practice elsewhere \u2013 notably in Finland and Japan&quot;. In 2003, Ofsted carried out a comparative study of the education of six-year-olds in England, Denmark and Finland and found that, even then, &quot;much more importance is attached in Finland and Denmark to the way six-year-olds develop as people, rather than what they should know and be able to do&quot;. Finland in particular finishes well ahead in international tests given to 15-year-olds. There is also concern among subject experts that, for all their aspirations, ministers will not succeed in raising standards if they do not adequately support teachers&apos; professional development to implement the changes. One maths education academic, who has influence with ministers, also suggested that the short timeframe from development to implementation may be a problem: the new curriculum was developed over a hectic two-year period, with ministers expecting a dramatic change in standards to follow. &quot;The danger is that, in trying to do things too fast, we just end up getting it wrong again. One of the things you find, looking at [successful] Pacific Rim countries, is that they take their time,&quot; he says. Existing knowledge Professor Andrew Pollard, of the universities of London and Bristol, who was a member of Gove&apos;s expert group on the curriculum but has become a critic of the reforms, says his concern is that subject content has been drawn up without reference to English children&apos;s existing knowledge and experience. &quot;This is a serious problem because some expectations of performance are pitched at levels that subject experts and experienced teachers have stated are unrealistic,&quot; he says. &quot;If this proves to be the case, artificial failure will be created by this curriculum with educationally destructive effects.&quot; Faced with objections, ministers tend to reply that education in England simply has to become more ambitious. The national curriculum minister, Elizabeth Truss, is said to have told a meeting of maths educators last month that if countries such as Singapore can have a curriculum that asks more of pupils, we should be able to, too. This point is also made by Tim Oates, who chaired the government&apos;s &quot;expert panel&quot;, which reported for the curriculum review. The idea behind the new programmes of study was to promote the study of fewer topics in greater depth, which would enable pupils to build their understanding better than they had in the past. Oates says the curriculum reform was also informed by serious research into practice in other countries, which had not happened for previous reviews, such as Labour&apos;s 2007 secondary curriculum changes. But he says that if the consultation reveals concerns about difficulty, they will be considered before ministers finalise the curriculum. Oates also believes the curriculum review should help create a more even playing field between state and private schools. &quot;No one has spotted the fact that the prep school curriculum has really got out of sync with the national curriculum,&quot; he says. &quot;[Prep school pupils] are dividing with fractions prior to secondary \u2013 maybe we should be about what the left was about in the 1930s: giving all children access to privileged knowledge.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/apr/02/development-leadership-organisations-model", "sentences": ["Lee Kuan Yew is seen as the leader of Singapore&apos;s growth miracle, for instance; Nelson Mandela is credited as the leader of South Africa&apos;s peace process; and Paul Kagame is considered the leader of Rwanda&apos;s recent progress.", "Finally, I have been looking at some of the hero stories we constantly identify when thinking about who leads and why: like Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew.", "But other individuals had to exercise leadership and come up with the ideas to transform Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-02T11:41:00Z", "title": "We need to radically rethink who leads development and what they do", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Leadership", "Global development", "Blog", "Work & careers"], "article": "Development requires change. Change is difficult; most observers believe it demands some degree of leadership. But what does this mean: who leads development? What do they do that is so special? Answers to these questions usually focus on high profile individuals we view as heroes. Lee Kuan Yew is seen as the leader of Singapore&apos;s growth miracle, for instance; Nelson Mandela is credited as the leader of South Africa&apos;s peace process; and Paul Kagame is considered the leader of Rwanda&apos;s recent progress. We view similar individuals as &apos;champions&apos; that make projects work or foster reform success, arguing that these people drive development through their influence and power. This implies that development requires waiting for such people, identifying them, and letting them lead. But what evidence do we have that these people actually lead development? My research suggests that the evidence is slim, and leadership is not just about heroes. It appears to me that any time you see some real change and development it is the product of leadership by many people and organisations working together; not any one hero or champion. I call this multi-agent leadership, and believe it is the kind of leadership needed in development. I first saw evidence of multi-agent leadership when examining cases of successful reform in some of the toughest places on earth \u2014 like Afghanistan, Kosovo, and Rwanda. I assumed that leadership had been central to these stories and expected to find a small number of heroes responsible (like president Kagame in Rwanda), who would be seen as the leader because of the position they held. I also expected that the people identified as leaders would be men. My biases were based on arguments about the kind of leadership one expects in male dominated, bureaucratic, developing countries; where we think the world is top-down and dominated by powerful men in high-level positions. But I was surprised. Interviewees identified over ten &apos;leaders&apos; per case, and only a minority identified the high-level heroes as leaders. Most named people and organisations that none of the researchers thought would be considered leaders. Some of these &apos;leaders&apos; were administrative assistants, others were low-level bureaucrats or technical experts working in the non-profit sector. The interviewees did not reference positions when explaining why these people were considered leaders. Instead, they gave specific and substantive reasons why they identified each person. Examples include, &quot;he provided money&quot;, &quot;she ensured people met regularly&quot;, and &quot;he had the ideas.&quot; I came out of this study thinking that leadership involved in creative interaction of multiple agents, all playing important and different functional roles. The most important roles seemed to be those of &apos;convener&apos; and &apos;connector&apos; \u2014 the ones who mobilised others to participate in the leadership solution. These roles were played by agents no one would call the &apos;champion&apos; or &apos;hero&apos; in any case; they did not stand out in the limelight and were not the ones I expected to be called &apos;leader&apos;, and were often women or outsiders. In the chance that this research was a fluke, I recently started looking at a number of successful reforms identified by Princeton University&apos;s Innovations for Successful States programme. I had students scrutinise 30 cases of innovative reform in developing countries and asked if there was evidence that different agents had played different functional leadership roles. This proved to be true in all cases, where multi-agent leadership seemed vital, whether the context was results management in Rwanda or public financial management reform in Indonesia or service delivery improvements or anti-corruption reform in Mongolia or Bihar, India. This is not to say that there was not a &apos;hero&apos; in each of the cases, however. Like movies, most case studies have a central character and these were no different. The &apos;heroes&apos; were seen to play specific roles in each case, however, mostly providing authority to others and motivating those engaged in the change process. This is the role of the &apos;hero&apos;: to stand at the front, give others cover and inspiration, and create space for the multi-agent leadership solution to emerge. This is an important role but it is unlikely to matter if other &apos;leaders&apos; are not around to identify problems, provide ideas for solutions, mobilise resources, and actually organise the real work of change. (The &apos;heroes&apos; did not play these roles in any of the cases we were looking at). Finally, I have been looking at some of the hero stories we constantly identify when thinking about who leads and why: like Singapore and Lee Kuan Yew. In this and other cases I find that the heroes were only part of the leadership story, and there are many other individuals involved in making development happen. Lee played a crucial role inspiring teams and authorising them to do great things. But other individuals had to exercise leadership and come up with the ideas to transform Singapore. And yet others had to stick their necks out and fund these ideas. And yet others put their careers and families on the line to lead the implementation and adaptation of these ideas. In conclusion, even when one expects that the context demands that leadership in development will be about heroic men sitting atop responsive hierarchies, I would argue that there is more to the story. There is more in terms of the complexity of the task of leadership, and more in terms of the number of agents involved in providing the leadership. There will always be those who stand out, and maybe we need to call them heroes or champions. But they are just part of the group of agents who really lead development, playing different roles from different positions inside and outside social and government hierarchies.

J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cahuzac&apos;s sudden admission that he hid \u20ac600,000 (\u00a3510,000) offshore for more than two decades is the biggest scandal to hit Hollande&apos;s presidency. The public admission by the man who led France&apos;s fight against tax evasion that he secretly defrauded the taxman and was &quot;caught in a spiral of lies&quot; is a huge embarrassment for Hollande, who promised that his government would be beyond reproach after the corruption allegations that dogged previous French administrations. Until last month, Cahuzac, 60, a former MP and cardiologist who became a plastic surgeon specialising in hair transplants, was Hollande&apos;s budget minister leading a crusade against tax fraudsters and tax havens. He had the crucial task of streamlining the budget and running Hollande&apos;s crackdown on rich individuals who would be made to pay a bigger share of the tax burden. In December last year, the investigative website Mediapart reported that Cahuzac had held an undisclosed account at the Swiss bank UBS for 20 years and had travelled to Geneva to close it and transfer the money to Singapore just before he was made head of the parliamentary finance commission in February 2010. The site published a recording in which Cahuzac allegedly told his wealth manager of his embarrassment over the Swiss account in 2000. A voice said to be Cahuzac&apos;s says in the recording: &quot;What bothers me is that I still have an account open with UBS \u2013 UBS is not necessarily the most hidden of banks.&quot; For the four months since, Cahuzac had repeatedly sworn he had no hidden account, taking libel action against Mediapart, swearing before parliament that he had &quot;never had an account abroad&quot; and taking to the airwaves to issue strong denials while continuing to lead France&apos;s clampdown on tax evasion. Two weeks ago, when judges opened a preliminary inquiry into the account and his own possible tax evasion, he finally resigned but insisted he was innocent. Hollande applauded his resignation to &quot;better defend his honour&quot;. But on Tuesday, Cahuzac asked to see the investigating judges and then issued his shock confession via his blog, announcing that he was sorry for lying. He said the hidden account did exist but he did not say which country it was in. &quot;I was caught in a spiral of lies and I did wrong,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I ask the president, the prime minister, my former colleagues in the government, to forgive me for the damage I have caused them.&quot; He said he was &quot;devastated by remorse&quot;. His lawyer said he had been placed under formal investigation for allegedly laundering the proceeds of tax fraud. French Socialist MPs reacted with shock to what was a huge blow to the credibility of the French political class. Hollande described Cahuzac&apos;s actions as an &quot;unforgivable moral error&quot;. The prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said &quot;lies are not acceptable in democracy&quot; and rushed to appear on the prime-time news to limit the damage. Pascal Durand, head of the Green party, which has two ministers in government, said &quot;Mr Cahuzac&apos;s lie was a lie of state&quot; which &quot;discredits the collective word of politicians&quot;.

For a start, the US start-up grows its produce in urban warehouses, not rural fields. Among the other basics of agriculture that it turns upside down is a plant&apos;s need for sunlight and soil. AeroFarms has done away with both. The New Jersey-based firm is a pioneer in a technology called &quot;aeroponics&quot;. What sounds like a second-rate rock band is actually a cutting-edge line of agricultural science. Nutrients are sprayed in a mist directly onto the roots of the plants, which are held suspended in a cloth-like medium while being exposed to light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of sunlight. &quot;We can grow a plant from 16 days from seed to harvest. And that&apos;s without genetically modifying anything. It&apos;s just giving the plant what it wants, when it wants it and in the quantity it wants it&quot;, enthuses David Rosenberg, a self-confessed &quot;serial entrepreneur&quot; and chief executive of Aerofarms. Rosenberg is, as you&apos;d expect, an inveterate evangelist for this hi-tech farming system. From a pure production perspective, AeroFarms has so far grown 237 different types of plants under its dry, enclosed environment. Most fall into the category of leafy greens, such as rocket, kale and spinach. Aeroponics delivers a fresher and healthier product, Rosenberg insists. The plants are grown, harvested and packaged in temperature-controlled, completely dry conditions. So no damage from sudden heat waves or night frosts . Aerofarms&apos; urban locations also mean shorter distances to market. So again, less time growing brown by the roadside or spoiling in transit. Rosenberg isn&apos;t a big fan of putting expiration dates on food. He&apos;d rather &quot;celebrate&quot; the date of harvest. &quot;We can get it in stores the same day that we harvest it. Instead of in the UK, you&apos;re probably buying product from Spain, Portugal or Italy and it could take four days to a week before you get it.&quot; Because the growing conditions are dry, there&apos;s no need to wash the food either. That means less bruising, less drying (and therefore less energy) and less chance of soggy lettuce ending up on your plate. The system used by Aerofarms is also free of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides, while the seeds it uses are entirely organic. The agribusiness entrepreneur insists that his company isn&apos;t &quot;messing with the genetics&quot; of its crops. The only exception to the firm&apos;s chemical-free status is its use of non-organic fertiliser. Rosenberg&apos;s reasoning here is carefully considered. Organic fertlisers are essentially &quot;animal poop&quot;, which when introduced into a controlled biome, raise the risk of bacterial contamination. Second, organic fertlisers typically need to be dried, transported and then hydrated, all of which carries implications for energy and water use as well as cost. And so to the system&apos;s environmental credentials. Growing salads on an industrial estate feels intrinsically less &apos;natural&apos; than out in the open. But Rosenberg puts up a spirited defence for the greenness of his green leaves. His strongest argument surrounds water use. Agriculture is responsible for around 80% of all ground and surface water consumption in the US. According to the AeroFarms&apos; chief executive, aeroponics uses 90% less water than conventional agriculture and about 50% less water than some hydroponics systems \u2013 a similar non-soil approach to farming in which the plant&apos;s roots rest in a nutrient-rich water solution. The big question mark surrounds energy. The AeroFarms&apos; system relies heavily on electricity for heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as lighting. The company looks to use solar power where possible and is currently investigating the potential of using plant roots to produce energy anaerobically. Even so, Rosenberg admits to having a tough time quantifying his firm&apos;s energy footprint compared to conventional farming. AeroFarms&apos; energy-to-product ratio is undoubtedly higher. But that&apos;s not the whole picture because traditional agriculture consumes extensive &quot;embedded energy&quot; via fertlisers, pesticides, water and transport. He cites the example of California, where much of the green leaf crop is grown in the US. A fifth of the state&apos;s energy bill is spent on moving water for farming in drought areas, he maintains. The Salinas Valley, California&apos;s agricultural heartland, currently faces an annual $35m water remediation tab. As Rosenberg points out: &quot;They are trying to figure out how they are going to pay. Are they cutting school programmes or cleaning up the water?&quot; Aeroponics is clearly a technology to watch. AeroFarms currently has four farms using its technology in cities across the US, as well as one in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Plans are afoot to establish others in Singapore, Russia and South Africa over the next year or so. The technology is also proving popular in urbanised Asian markets such as Japan and South Korean. Rosenberg insists that the potential market is huge: &quot;In the US, pretty much every supermarket sells product in the categories where we can be sold and people would buy it, from the poor neighbourhoods to the rich neighbourhoods.&quot; Yet is it a solution to the world&apos;s food security problems? According to official projections, the world population is set to grow to 9 billion by 2050. Again, the AeroFarms&apos; chief executive is upbeat, stressing the nutritional density of green leaf vegetables. There&apos;s a major catch, however. &quot;A lot of people on our planet don&apos;t eat salads&quot;, he concedes. Inculcating the habit of salad-eating will be key if companies like AeroFarms are to move from niche players targeting affluent urbanites to a food solution for the world&apos;s masses. To raise awareness and tackle the cultural barriers to salad-eating, Aeroponics has installed a pilot farm in a tough inner city school in Newark, New Jersey. It&apos;s the size of a car and located in the school cafeteria itself. &quot;The kids seed it, grow it and harvest the food\u2026 It&apos;s really changing their eating habits&quot;, says Rosenberg. Another big obstacle to scale is cost. Since the start of the agricultural age, anyone with a few seeds and a patch of fertile ground has been able to grow food to eat. For one of AeroFarm&apos;s highly sophisticated farm systems, you&apos;re looking at a minimum outlay of around $3m (\u00a31.98m). AeroFarms admits that the capital intensiveness of the aeroponics model makes it hard to attract venture capital, but the company is hoping its franchise-type approach will see it through. &quot;Our vision of scaling is to partner with other people on this journey to build farms in cities where they help invest the equity to build a farm in a particular city&quot;, Rosenberg states. \u2022 David Rosenberg, chief executive of Aerofarms will be speaking about generating value in a resource constrained world at Sustainability 24.

In an attempt to lessen the impact of a scandal threatening to derail his government, Hollande made a surprise TV address on Wednesday following Cahuzac&apos;s spectacular admission that, despite four months of vowing on TV and in parliament that he had no foreign bank account, he had in fact hidden money abroad for around 20 years. Cahuzac, who until last month was Hollande&apos;s tax tsar and budget minister in charge of a crackdown on tax evasion, now faces charges for laundering money from tax fraud.

Thierry Mariani, UMP&apos;s vice-president, said of the Socialist leadership: &quot;Frankly I find it hard to believe that they only learned the truth 48 hours ago, or else I guess we&apos;re being led by a big simpleton.&quot; At parliamentary questions, MPs piled pressure on to the finance minister, Pierre Moscovici, accusing him of using his ministry&apos;s administration to try to clear Cahuzac&apos;s name before the legal inquiry had run its course. The UMP MP Claude Goasguen said Moscovici should resign, but Moscovici said: &quot;If you&apos;re looking to accuse someone, you&apos;re knocking on the wrong door.&quot; He told Le Monde of Cahuzac: &quot;Every time, and it was more than 50 times, when I interrogated him, he gave me numerous and vigorous denials, looking straight into my eyes.&quot; Moscovici said his only mistake had been showing &quot;too much trust&quot;. As opposition politicians wondered how the \u00c9lys\u00e9e could not have established the truth of the account months ago, the interior ministry issued a statement saying there was no &quot;parallel inquiry&quot; or involvement of the secret services. The prime minister insisted that unlike previous administrations, the Socialist government was letting the justice system take its course and not pressuring investigators. Cahuzac, 60, was a cardiologist who later made a fortune in plastic surgery by setting up a hair-transplant clinic near the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. He famously spruced up the balding pates of some of France&apos;s most high-profile men for substantial fees. &quot;When you can&apos;t see the join, it means he did it,&quot; one Socialist MP told Le Nouvel Observateur of Cahuzac&apos;s trichological expertise. Elected MP in 1997, he headed the parliament&apos;s commission on public finances. As Hollande&apos;s budget minister, his entourage called him the star of government. The French media continued to question where the money in the secret foreign accounts had come from. In the late 1980s, Cahuzac worked in the health ministry, in charge of dealing with the powerful French pharmaceutical industry. At the time, he flatly denied any question of payments from pharmaceutical companies. Cahuzac&apos;s lawyer, Jean Veil, said the money in the foreign account, which had not been topped up for 12 years, came from &quot;his income as a surgeon&quot; and &quot;his activity as a consultant&quot;. After leaving the health ministry, Cahuzac set up a consultancy firm working with pharmaceutical groups. The intrigue surrounding the account deepened when Le Monde reported that the Swiss bank account set up by Cahuzac in 1992, before being transferred to Singapore, was opened for him by a former lawyer who had been a member of a far-right students&apos; union and who was close to the leader of the far-right Front National, Marine Le Pen. Swiss prosecutors confirmed that Cahuzac had agreed to allow details of the Swiss account to be transferred to French investigators."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/03/offshore-secrets-owners-unmasked", "sentences": ["Photograph: Pat Roque/AP    Late president Marcos&apos; eldest daughter, now a provincial governor, is listed in 2005 in the BVI as the &quot;investment advisor&quot; and beneficiary of the Sintra Trust, set up by her associate, businessman Mark Chua of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-03T22:09:00Z", "title": "Profiles of leading secret account holders", "tags": ["Tax avoidance", "British Virgin Islands", "World news", "Business"], "article": "Mongolia Name: Bayartsogt SangajavOffshore company: Legend Plus Capital Limited     Bayartsogt Sangajav.

The leak of 2m emails and other documents, mainly from the offshore haven of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), has the potential to cause a seismic shock worldwide to the booming offshore trade, with a former chief economist at McKinsey estimating that wealthy individuals may have as much as $32tn (\u00a321tn) stashed in overseas havens. In France, Jean-Jacques Augier, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s campaign co-treasurer and close friend, has been forced to publicly identify his Chinese business partner. It emerges as Hollande is mired in financial scandal because his former budget minister concealed a Swiss bank account for 20 years and repeatedly lied about it. In Mongolia, the country&apos;s former finance minister and deputy speaker of its parliament says he may have to resign from politics as a result of this investigation. But the two can now be named for the first time because of their use of companies in offshore havens, particularly in the British Virgin Islands, where owners&apos; identities normally remain secret. The names have been unearthed in a novel project by the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists [ICIJ], in collaboration with the Guardian and other international media, who are jointly publishing their research results this week. The naming project may be extremely damaging for confidence among the world&apos;s wealthiest people, no longer certain that the size of their fortunes remains hidden from governments and from their neighbours. BVI&apos;s clients include Scot Young, a millionaire associate of deceased oligarch Boris Berezovsky. Dundee-born Young is in jail for contempt of court for concealing assets from his ex-wife. Young&apos;s lawyer, to whom he signed over power of attorney, appears to control interests in a BVI company that owns a potentially lucrative Moscow development with a value estimated at $100m. Another is jailed fraudster Achilleas Kallakis. He used fake BVI companies to obtain a record-breaking \u00a3750m in property loans from reckless British and Irish banks. As well as Britons hiding wealth offshore, an extraordinary array of government officials and rich families across the world are identified, from Canada, the US, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, China, Thailand and former communist states. The data seen by the Guardian shows that their secret companies are based mainly in the British Virgin Islands. Sample offshore owners named in the leaked files include: \u2022 Jean-Jacques Augier, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s 2012 election campaign co-treasurer, launched a Caymans-based distributor in China with a 25% partner in a BVI company. Augier says his partner was Xi Shu, a Chinese businessman. \u2022 Mongolia&apos;s former finance minister. Bayartsogt Sangajav set up &quot;Legend Plus Capital Ltd&quot; with a Swiss bank account, while he served as finance minister of the impoverished state from 2008 to 2012. He says it was &quot;a mistake&quot; not to declare it, and says &quot;I probably should consider resigning from my position&quot;. \u2022 The president of Azerbaijan and his family. A local construction magnate, Hassan Gozal, controls entities set up in the names of President Ilham Aliyev&apos;s two daughters. \u2022 The wife of Russia&apos;s deputy prime minister. Olga Shuvalova&apos;s husband, businessman and politician Igor Shuvalov, has denied allegations of wrongdoing about her offshore interests. \u2022A senator&apos;s husband in Canada. Lawyer Tony Merchant deposited more than US$800,000 into an offshore trust. He paid fees in cash and ordered written communication to be &quot;kept to a minimum&quot;. \u2022 A dictator&apos;s child in the Philippines: Maria Imelda Marcos Manotoc, a provincial governor, is the eldest daughter of former President Ferdinand Marcos, notorious for corruption. \u2022 Spain&apos;s wealthiest art collector, Baroness Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza, a former beauty queen and widow of a Thyssen steel billionaire, who uses offshore entities to buy pictures. \u2022 US: Offshore clients include Denise Rich, ex-wife of notorious oil trader Marc Rich, who was controversially pardoned by President Clinton on tax evasion charges. She put $144m into the Dry Trust, set up in the Cook Islands. It is estimated that more than $20tn acquired by wealthy individuals could lie in offshore accounts. The UK-controlled BVI has been the most successful among the mushrooming secrecy havens that cater for them. The Caribbean micro-state has incorporated more than a million such offshore entities since it began marketing itself worldwide in the 1980s. Owners&apos; true identities are never revealed. Even the island&apos;s official financial regulators normally have no idea who is behind them. The British Foreign Office depends on the BVI&apos;s company licensing revenue to subsidise this residual outpost of empire, while lawyers and accountants in the City of London benefit from a lucrative trade as intermediaries. They claim the tax-free offshore companies provide legitimate privacy. Neil Smith, the financial secretary of the autonomous local administration in the BVI&apos;s capital Tortola, told the Guardian it was very inaccurate to claim the island &quot;harbours the ethically challenged&quot;. He said: &quot;Our legislation provides a more hostile environment for illegality than most jurisdictions&quot;. Smith added that in &quot;rare instances \u2026where the BVI was implicated in illegal activity by association or otherwise, we responded swiftly and decisively&quot;. The Guardian and ICIJ&apos;s Offshore Secrets series last year exposed how UK property empires have been built up by, among others, Russian oligarchs, fraudsters and tax avoiders, using BVI companies behind a screen of sham directors. Such so-called &quot;nominees&quot;, Britons giving far-flung addresses on Nevis in the Caribbean, Dubai or the Seychelles, are simply renting out their names for the real owners to hide behind. The whistleblowing group WikiLeaks caused a storm of controversy in 2010 when it was able to download almost two gigabytes of leaked US military and diplomatic files. The new BVI data, by contrast, contains more than 200 gigabytes, covering more than a decade of financial information about the global transactions of BVI private incorporation agencies. It also includes data on their offshoots in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Cook Islands in the Pacific."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/04/how-cook-perfect-crab-linguine", "sentences": ["Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    I miss the chilli in that recipe too: it&apos;s a great pairing with crab, as anyone who has ever visited Singapore will testify, and adds a wonderful warmth to proceedings."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T06:00:00Z", "title": "How to cook the perfect crab linguine", "tags": ["Shellfish", "Pasta", "Seafood", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Whatever the heavens may think, now the last sugary crumbs of Easter bunny are but an irritating stain on the sofa cushions, it is time to put away wintery things, and turn our attention to lighter, more spring-like fare. If nothing else, it might finally shame the weather into behaving a little more appropriately. Crab linguine, in my opinion, fits the bill perfectly, being both chock-full of the kind of zesty flavours that encourage the pleasant delusion one is sitting on a Neapolitan terrace in the spring sunshine, and comfortingly starchy, especially when served in very un-Italian quantities on a chilly British evening. This is a dish that will really come into its own in a few weeks&apos; time, when the native brown crab season kicks off in earnest, but in the meantime, there&apos;s no harm in a little practice. White or brown?     Old Market House crab linguine. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    Although, as every fool knows, most of the crab&apos;s flavour resides in the cheaper brown meat, most recipes simply call for the more delicate white stuff. Perhaps Italian chefs prefer to keep the rest for sandwiches. The only one I find which does use it, from Brixham&apos;s Old Market House restaurant, happens to be the last I try \u2013 and it&apos;s a revelation. The brown meat, which is stirred into an onion and white wine base, lends the entire dish a rich, crustaceous flavour. They pile the sweeter, fluffier white meat on top of the dish to serve, but I&apos;m going to toss it through at the last minute, so it clings to the strands of pasta, while retaining its distinctive texture \u2013 almost like a fishy parmesan. Although it&apos;s already easy to find British crab in my local fishmongers, I also give tinned Vietnamese king crab a go \u2013 it&apos;s the closest thing I can find to the River Cottage Fish Book&apos;s spider crab in north London. Not close enough, however \u2013 although the flavour is good, it dissolves into a soggy mess in the pan. If you can get it, however, spider crab would no doubt be most authentic. Alliums     Tom Aikens' crab linguine. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    In a dish as simple as this, every ingredient must be chosen with care, particularly pungent members of the onion family. Tom Aikens, for example, deploys vast numbers of shallots in the recipe in his book Fish, and their sweet, winey flavour completely takes over, giving the dish an oddly French character. The Old Market House, meanwhile, goes with onion, which I find a bit boring in this context, although the spring onions on top work very well with the crab meat. Garlic, however, as used with gay abandon by everyone else, seems to be the key to this dish: finely chopped, it melts into the sauce, and the slight heat is an excellent foil to the sweetness of the seafood. Vegetables     River Cafe crab linguine. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    As simplicity is key here, I&apos;m not sold on the River Cafe&apos;s shaved fennel. The aniseedy sweetness is a classic pairing with crab, but I think it would work better raw than boiled with the pasta. For me, however, it&apos;s simply a distraction from the main attraction: the crab. A little fennel is nothing compared to Tom Aikens&apos; sweet and sour cherry tomato and shallot sauce though \u2013 great recipe, seasoned with wine and sprigs of thyme, but the poor crustacean doesn&apos;t stand a chance. In contrast, River Cottage&apos;s fresh tomatoes are bland and mushy, giving the whole dish a rather grainy texture: their inferior April ripeness is clearly partly to blame, but it would take some seriously flavoursome tomatoes to come up to scratch in this context. Liquids     Angela Hartnett's crab linguine. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    Tom Aikens uses a vastly involved crab stock in his recipe, which demands quite some preparation \u2013 with the sauce as well, his dish takes three times as long to prepare as anyone else&apos;s. Hence the Michelin star, perhaps \u2013 but I can&apos;t imagine Angela Hartnett faffing about with such things. Anyway, I digress: the stock is lovely, but I think you can achieve a far greater intensity of flavour with brown crabmeat at rather less cost to your own time. In any case, I prefer the tanginess of the River Cafe&apos;s lemon juice and the Old Market House&apos;s white wine, although Hartnett uses both, which makes her dish rather too acidic for my taste. As I love the lemon zest she also uses, I&apos;m going for lemon juice: the wine will make an excellent accompaniment instead. The Old Market House goes for a white wine and cream sauce, which, together with the brown crabmeat, makes the dish very rich indeed. It would make a lovely little starter, but it&apos;s not the fresh, Mediterranean pasta I&apos;m looking for. Herbs and spices     River Cottage crab linguine. Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian    I miss the chilli in that recipe too: it&apos;s a great pairing with crab, as anyone who has ever visited Singapore will testify, and adds a wonderful warmth to proceedings. I prefer the fruity acidity of fresh red chillies, as used by Aikens, Hartnett and the River Cottage to the River Cafe&apos;s dried version. I am very keen on their fennel seeds, however: the more intensely sweet, slightly mentholated flavour works better than the fresh stuff here as far as I&apos;m concerned, especially with the chilli and Hartnett&apos;s lemon zest. With my eyes closed, I could definitely be dining in sunnier climes. (Although eating pasta with your eyes closed is not to be advised.) Herbs add both colour and a certain freshness to the dish: I find peppery flat-leaf parsley is more in keeping with the other ingredients than the River Cottage&apos;s chives, or Angela Hartnett&apos;s fragrant basil. I&apos;m going to finish off the dish with a flourish of extra virgin olive oil, as the River Cafe suggests, rather than Aikens&apos; butter: after all, we&apos;ve all eaten quite enough of that on our jacket potatoes and crumpets over the past few months. And a change is as good as a rest, as my Irish nonna always said. Crab linguine     Felicity Cloake's perfect crab linguine.

Add the zest of half a lemon and the juice of all of it, and then stir in the brown crabmeat. Drain the pasta, reserving a few spoonfuls of the cooking water, and toss with the sauce, along with the white crabmeat and parsley. Add the extra water if the dish seems a little dry. Season to taste, and divide between bowls. Drizzle each bowl with a little extra virgin olive oil, and serve immediately.

Three! And, after visiting more countries than even the most dedicated Inter-Railer, Spurs, Chelsea and Newcastle have decided they are, to use Riley&apos;s terminology, definitely &apos;in&apos;. &quot;To win against European teams with good players, you have to consider that as really positive,&quot; rambled Rafa Ben\u00edtez ahead of tonight&apos;s visit of Rubin Kazan. &quot;When we won [Big Vase and league with Valencia] we won both. Why can&apos;t you? I don&apos;t see any fan who says &apos;Don&apos;t win versus United, don&apos;t win this game&apos;. You have to try to win.&quot; Chelsea will be without the knacked Ashley Cole and Gary Cahill and the cup-tied Demba Ba, which means Fernando Torres and Plain Old John Terry will get rare starts. Meanwhile Spurs face Basel/Basle/Barrrrrl at White Hart Lane, with Scott Parker confident they can juggle the twin demands of league and Vase. &quot;As a player, there is nothing more rewarding than going to a final and lifting a trophy but we knew at the outset what we needed to do this season,&quot; he monotoned. &quot;So we&apos;ll probably look to take both.&quot; Heck, even Alan Pardew is confident that his side can overcome Benfica, who are unbeaten in the league all season, despite being without Hatem Ben Arfa, Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik Tiot\u00e9. &quot;There&apos;s never a mission impossible in football,&quot; claimed Pardew. &quot;We can get a good result here.&quot; The bookies rate them as whopping 8-1 outsiders, but given that Benfica are coached by Jorge Jesus, perhaps a miracle is on the cards at the Stadium of Light tonight?

Telecoms will be among the first industries to be liberalised under Burma&apos;s reformist government, which hopes to place mobiles into the hands of between 75% and 80% of its 60 million citizens by 2016, up from an estimated 6% today. If take-up is high, the entire mobile market in Burma \u2013 renamed Myanmar by the ruling military junta \u2013 could be worth $10bn (\u00a36bn) a year, with networks generating $7.3bn of those revenues, research by Ericsson found. Foreign companies are eager to partake in what has been described as a mouthwatering opportunity, and by Thursday&apos;s deadline 22 bids had been submitted. Vodafone and China mobile, the world&apos;s two largest wireless companies, have made a joint application, with the British firm named as the &quot;experienced&quot; operator because of its extensive international holdings. &quot;Myanmar will be an important new market for the global mobile industry,&quot; the two companies said in a statement. Liberalisation would &quot;accelerate the pace of Myanmar&apos;s social and economic development through mass-market adoption of mobile services, similar to the mobile-led transformation under way within many other Asian and African countries&quot;, it added.     Vodafone and China mobile are the world\u2019s two largest wireless companies. Photograph: Felix Clay for the Guardian    Vodafone owned a small stake in China Mobile until 2010, and the two groups have maintained their relationship in areas such as international calls. They declined to discuss the size of each partner&apos;s share in any joint venture. A shortlist will be announced this month and on 27 June two winning foreign ventures will be invited to join Burma&apos;s two domestic networks in offering services.

Burma&apos;s former telecoms minister, Thein Tun, resigned in January after clashing with President Thein Sein over the latter&apos;s plan to cut the cost . Limited services were introduced in 2001, and the price of activating a phone was initially about 4.5m kyat (\u00a33,400). But state-run television heralded a new era this week, saying that 350,000 sim cards a month will be sold starting on 24 April, with the chips costing 1,500 kyat (\u00a31)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/04/david-cameron-british-virgin-islands", "sentences": ["This follows the leak to ICIJ of a hard drive containing 200GB of internal files of offshore incorporation agencies in the BVI, Singapore and the Cook Islands."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T19:45:36Z", "title": "David Cameron urged to act over British Virgin Islands", "tags": ["Sark", "UK news", "British Virgin Islands", "World news", "Corporate governance", "Tax avoidance", "Business", "David Cameron", "Politics", "Liberal Democrats"], "article": "The prime minister has come under pressure to act against Britain&apos;s secretive offshore industry at June&apos;s G8 summit, as leaked evidence continued to mount that politicians and tycoons from all over the world have used the British Virgin Islands to hide funds. The premier of Georgia, Bidzina Ivanishvili, was the latest to be named, along with prominent Pakistani, Indian, Thai and Indonesian figures \u2013 while there was fresh evidence of Britons acting as front directors for companies based in offshore havens such as the BVI. A senior Liberal Democrat figure said the leaks showed the secret haven of the BVI &quot;stains the face of Britain&quot;, as anti-corruption campaigners called for action. Lord Oakeshott, the Lib Dem peer and a former Treasury spokesman, said: &quot;How can David Cameron keep a straight face calling for the G8 to make big business pay tax when we let the BVI use British law and British protection to suck in billions in dirty money?&quot; He asked: &quot;How much British aid paid to corrupt countries like Pakistan ends up behind a BVI brass plate?&quot; Despite mounting evidence that British sham directors are selling their names as fronts for offshore secrecy, the UK&apos;s Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) signalled that politicians are reluctant to move against them. A report on the sham directors scandal has already been sent to ministers by the BIS deputy head of corporate governance, Jo Shanmugalingam. This followed a Guardian-BBC investigation last year into the leaked data which revealed that two dozen Britons, giving obscure offshore addresses, were purporting to control thousands of companies. The latest example, which emerged on Thursday, is of a &quot;general builder&quot;, Kevin Gaitely. He gives an address in south London and is registered as the director of Tamalaris Consolidated, a company blacklisted by the UK and US as a front for Iran. He is recorded as a director of a variety of other UK and BVI companies. Ministers insist they are not ready to act. The BIS issued a statement on Thursday night saying: &quot;The vast majority of companies and directors do comply with the law and they should not be unfairly burdened, so we will focus our attention on those who deliberately seek to break the law.&quot; It is not illegal as such for Britons to rent out their names on behalf of offshore companies, so the BIS statement appears to be a recipe for inaction. Meanwhile MPs criticised tax avoidance in Pakistan in a report issued on Thursday by the UK Commons committee on overseas aid. It said: &quot;We cannot expect people in the UK to pay taxes to improve education and health in Pakistan if the Pakistani elite does not pay meaningful amounts of income tax.&quot; Robert Palmer of the campaign group Global Witness repeated the call for Cameron to act, saying: &quot;The massive cache of leaked documents demonstrates how hidden ownership of shell companies facilitates corruption, tax dodging and other crimes.&quot; He said: &quot;The time to deal with this issue is now. Given that he has pledged to tackle these secretive shell companies at this year&apos;s G8 summit in Northern Ireland, he and his fellow leaders must commit to publishing information on the people who ultimately control and own companies.&quot; The names of thousands of owners of secret offshore companies are currently being published by the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), in collaboration with the Guardian and other international media. This follows the leak to ICIJ of a hard drive containing 200GB of internal files of offshore incorporation agencies in the BVI, Singapore and the Cook Islands. A spokesman for the Georgian prime minister, who had set up a BVI company called Bosherston Overseas Corp, said he had done everything in accordance with the law: &quot;For the reporting period of 2011-12, prime minister Ivanishvili had no interest in the company\u00a0\u2026 and therefore there was no obligation to report it in his [financial] declaration.&quot; In India, an MP from the ruling Congress party, Gaddam Vivekanand, said after an offshore company, Belrose Universal, was revealed to have been listed in his name: &quot;I do not remember being involved with such a company and have no connection with it.&apos;&apos; A spokeswoman for Stephen Riady, who heads one of Indonesia&apos;s richest families, said there was &quot;nothing illegal or improper in protecting the privacy of one&apos;s own information&quot; after the leaked files revealed that his family&apos;s Lippo Group conglomerate controlled a number of offshore entities. The incorporation firm, TrustNet, refers to them as &quot;Client A&quot;, noting &quot;client does not want to be seen dealing offshore&quot;. Their agent, Gary Phair, instructed TrustNet staff to &quot;delete any reference to &apos;C/- [Care of] Lippo&quot;. Thai MP Nalinee Taveesin, currently an official trade representative and previously blacklisted by the US for allegedly helping Robert Mugabe avoid sanctions, denied knowing about the offshore company Hall Kingston International, listed in her name. Her secretary said: &quot;The information about her being [a company] shareholder is incorrect.&quot; In Pakistan, Moonis Elahi, a politician from a prominent Punjab dynasty who was acquitted in a Pakistan court in 2011 of receiving payments in a corruption scandal, said he did not own offshore company Olive Grove Assets, listed to his name at the family residence in Lahore.

At the Design Council we demonstrate how, in addition to being a tool for growth, design methodologies can be instrumental in public service delivery \u2013 and strategic policy decision-making processes. With countries such as New Zealand, Australia, South Korea and Singapore all adopting design-led innovation to drive public and private sector renewal, the UK along with the rest of Europe, in our progressively global economy, will need to rely on knowledge, quality and sophistication to drive growth. It is becoming apparent that technological innovation and incremental adaptation of public services will no longer suffice. To be truly competitive, EU member states will have to instigate new approaches to innovation in both public and private spheres. In doing so ensure we close the divide between the advanced regions and those lagging behind. This month we willpublish our report for the European Commission, Design for Public Good, which seeks to address this gap. It will also provide a framework for all member states to progress in their use of design thinking as a way of not just adding, but creating value in our public services. No longer just an add-on, design has evolved into a full-spectrum, fully joined-up innovation process. In the public sector design thinking overcomes common structural flaws in service provision and policymaking. This is how: Joined-up process Rather than disjointedly patching together incremental solutions to problems as they arise, design thinking starts by understanding and anticipating needs to ensure solutions are appropriate and waste is avoided. Design approaches engage users in order to understand their needs, beyond the usual approach of surveys and focus groups. They also enable policymakers to tap into unspoken motivations through observation techniques and ensure buy-in when new measures are enacted, by engaging users in co-creation approaches. Iterative testing Rather than jumping straight to risky and expensive pilots, design thinking starts with low-cost, simple prototypes, which uncover unforeseen and unintended consequences. Tackles government silos Silo structures are a perennial problem in government. While the structural factors that cause this may be stubborn, design methods offer a uniquely effective way, through, for example, user journey mapping, of understanding which departments are relevant to a problem and engaging multidisciplinary teams in collaborations. Efficiency savings Through our programmes we&apos;ve used design process to deliver efficiency savings of \u00a3368k to Lewisham housing service, reduce rates of violence and aggression in A&amp;E wards, tackle social and emotional isolation among older adults and reinvent the patient experience for outpatients. We&apos;ve seen our work being valued at the heart of Whitehall. Design is increasingly being recognised as a valuable tool within policy development. The Design Council has been delivering workshops to senior civil servants across a large number of government departments over the past few months. Participants are realising that design has a crucial and integral role to play in policymaking, as well as policy implementation.\u00a0 Bel Reed is programme manager at the Design Council. Design for Public Good will be published on 30 April. \u2022 Want your say? Email us at public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

Morocco  In Mirleft, a coastal village south of Agadir and 30km or so from the pleasant seaside town of Sidi Ifni, the temperature this week will average 23C. Attracting visitors in search of peace and quiet and excellent beaches, the village is a dusty and slightly bohemian place, with a few simple restaurants and cafes. The Kasbah Tabelkoukt is a stylish guesthouse, just south of the village on a cliff overlooking (and with direct access to) a wild, secluded beach where you can surf. The hotel is decorated in an African style and has a small spa, plus rooms in a main house (the &quot;Kasbah&quot;) and some stone cottages set amid gardens. Rooms cost \u00a385 per night B&amp;B for a stay of four nights, an exclusive offer available from Epic Morocco (epicmorocco.co.uk, 020 8150 6131). Fly to Agadir, a 1.5hr drive away, with easyJet for \u00a3193 return, departing on April 23. Pelion peninsula, Greece The Pelion peninsula on mainland Greece is where forested mountains plunge into clear blue sea; inland sleepy mountain villages, little changed in centuries, are said to be among the most beautiful in the country. Go at the end of April when temperatures should be around 20C-24C and you&apos;ll catch the Greek Easter celebrations. The most important celebration in the Greek Orthodox calendar is marked with street processions and fireworks. Ionian &amp; Aegean Holidays is offering seven nights in a small off-the-beaten-track hotel, set among olive trees and overlooking the Pagasitic Gulf, from \u00a3402pp B&amp;B, a saving of 35%, departing on 3 May.

Photograph: Alamy    The rain&apos;s been a pain in Spain lately but, in the south at least, it is expected to brighten up from this week. Go Learn To (golearnto.com) has reduced the price of its week-long surf and yoga holiday, from \u00a3331 to \u00a3216. Based in Conil de la Frontera on the Costa de la Luz, the trip includes daily surf lessons and three yoga classes. Price is based on two sharing and doesn&apos;t include flights.

Sicily How about swapping hot porridge in the morning for an Italian breakfast in a Sicilian garden, featuring homemade crostata di mele (apple tart)? It&apos;s indulgent but you can burn off some of those extra calories with a walk along the white marlstone cliffs in the island&apos;s southern region of Scala Dei Turchi, which translates as Stairway of the Turks. La Bianca Scogliera (realmonte-bb.it +39 09 2281 4554) is a homely, cliff-top B&amp;B in the area, with rooms at \u00a342 per night and plenty of home cooking by your host, Signora Graziella. EasyJet (easyjet.com) has flights from Gatwick to Palermo, in the island&apos;s north-west, from \u00a3107 return this month. Anguilla, Caribbean While it has its share of luxury hotels, sleepy Anguilla has escaped much of the development that has blighted some of the Caribbean. Even while staying in a slick and stylish resort, such as the Viceroy, it&apos;s easy to dip into the island&apos;s local culture, finding cold beers, reggae beats and gatherings around smoky barbecues. Virgin Holidays and Hip Hotels are offering five nights in Anguilla from \u00a31,299pp \u2013 saving up to \u00a3280pp \u2013 including flights from Gatwick, transfers and B&amp;B accommodation.

Hotels can be pricey, too, so save some cash by booking into Bossa, a smart hostel in an old mansion within the atmospheric and boho neighbourhood of Santa Teresa, which is all winding streets, art galleries and independent cafes. At the end of April the larger dorms start from \u00a312pp, but there are private rooms too. A week in a junior suite from 27 April costs around \u00a357 per night, based on two sharing.

Florida Skyscanner.net has deals to Florida from \u00a3279, including return flights from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford with Thomson Airways for travel in mid April. East of Orlando, Florida&apos;s Space Coast stretches for 72 miles along the Atlantic. It&apos;s home to the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral, but it also boasts some of Florida&apos;s best surfing beaches. The closest to Orlando (an hour&apos;s drive) is Cocoa Beach, where you&apos;ll find Surf Studio Beach Resort (surf-studio.com, +1 321 783 7100, rooms from \u00a370), a popular family-owned motel with a 125ft sun deck, where you can hear the crash of the Atlantic waves."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-dies-portraits", "sentences": ["Like the guns of Singapore, their weapons were pointing in the wrong direction."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-08T22:51:16Z", "title": "The Margaret Thatcher I knew", "tags": ["Margaret Thatcher", "Politics", "UK news", "Conservatives"], "article": "Mikhail Gorbachev President of the USSR, 1985-1991 Others may have known her better than I and will have a lot to tell about her life and work, but my memories may be no less valuable, for they go back to the time of our co-operation at a pivotal moment in the history of Europe and of the world. We had stayed in touch, exchanging letters from time to time. I have read books about her and I&apos;m familiar with her articles and memoirs. I read her book Statecraft. Though there are statements and judgments with which I do not share, I agree with the high marks the book got from many political leaders, scholars and journalists for its author as a political writer and historian. I met Margaret Thatcher in late 1984 when I visited Great Britain at the head of a Soviet parliamentary delegation. We arrived in London on a Sunday, warmly welcomed by members of the British parliament. The following day, I, Alexander Yakovlev and Leonid Zamyatin were invited to Chequers. After the welcome and introductions, for Margaret was with several ministers of her government, we were invited to lunch. The conversation that began was without precedent. It was open and friendly. Nevertheless, our ideological differences immediately became apparent. Sometimes jokingly, and sometimes more seriously, unflattering remarks were made about capitalism and communism. It was clear even then that this was a woman of character. At some point, our conversation became so tense that some of those present thought that it would have no continuation. And then I said to Margaret that I had no instructions from the Politburo to persuade her to join the Communist party of the Soviet Union. She broke into laughter, and I hastened to add that we respected her views and I was hoping that she would treat my views the same way. We soon found that although we represented two opposing alliances and ideologies, we could engage in a real political dialogue on the most critical issues. We argued and we disagreed. But we had joined the dialogue. And that, in and of itself, was important \u2013 for the confrontation had reached a dangerous point. On many issues, our outlook was different, but the need to look for a way out was clear to both of us. Her famous remark, &quot;I like Mr Gorbachev, we can do business together,&quot; was later helpful to me. When I became general secretary of the Communist party, it made it easier to seek contacts and mutual understanding with Ronald Reagan and with leaders of other countries. I might add to my account of the Chequers meeting one detail that brought into focus the way the atmosphere between the parties was changing during the course of just a few hours. After lunch we retired to a small room for a talk. First, I took out my papers prepared in Moscow, and Margaret opened her ever-present purse to get quite a pile of pages that contained notes for the conversation. I began, putting aside my papers. She did the same, putting aside hers. She even took off her shoes and made herself comfortable in her armchair. It was all happening by an open fire. It was, after all, December \u2013 and a harsh one at that. Yet it was warm inside and as we went along, the atmosphere was improving. I then unfolded in front of Margaret a diagram divided into 1,000 squares. I said that if all nuclear weapons stockpiled primarily by the US and the Soviet Union were divided into 1,000 parts, then even one of them would be enough to cause irreparable damage to all life on Earth. The question was, why continue the race, what is the point of this insane competition? She replied that they had been forced to respond to the nuclear armament of the Soviet Union \u2013 a country that had not renounced the goals of world revolution. I countered that it was the US that had started it all \u2013 it invented the nuclear bomb and used it in Japan, when there was no military need for it, just the political calculus. I said that documents had already been published showing that just after the second world war there had been plans to strike the Soviet Union, at its vital centres, which would have devastated and virtually destroyed our country. The US led the race, I concluded. On top of it, let us not forget Winston Churchill&apos;s speech at Fulton, which in effect, ushered in the cold war. Margaret argued the western viewpoint \u2013 and she was fully committed to it. In fact, she was the ideologue for the view that nuclear weapons were a necessary deterrent to the USSR. I have to say that even later, and even after my meeting with Reagan at Reykjavik and the signing of the treaty eliminating all INF missiles, she continued to uphold her view of nuclear weapons. In one of our conversations, when we had already come to know each other well and were talking amicably, though as always, earnestly, I asked her why she felt so comfortable sitting on a nuclear powder keg. Be that as it may, it was then, during that talk at Chequers, that the special relationship was born, one that we not only preserved but expanded, working to change relations between our countries and put an end to the deep freeze in which they had been kept. I recall vividly her first visit to the USSR in spring 1987. She amazed me by her knowledge of our domestic developments, her understanding of the nature of changes then under way, her ability to evaluate them realistically and her readiness to share with us the experience of what she called &quot;my own perestroika&quot;. Margaret was eager to talk to ordinary people \u2013 not only in Moscow, but in Krylatskoye district, where she was greeted by hundreds of people. She also she visited Zagorsk, the site of the Trinity-Sergius monastery, a sacred place for Orthodox believers, and then went on to Georgia. That the Soviet people welcomed her so warmly and with genuine interest, that they were so open to the &quot;Iron Lady&quot;, was evidently an enjoyable experience to her. I felt that it also gave her a different view of our country and its citizens. Notwithstanding our differences of opinion, which remain, we worked closely and fruitfully together to advance the important processes of that\u00a0time \u2013 curbing the arms race, European developments, German unification and reversing Iraq&apos;s aggression in the Middle\u00a0East. She was genuinely interested in what was happening in our country. She closely, and with astonishing command of detail, followed perestroika and glasnost, and sincerely wished for our process of change to succeed \u2013 though, of course, she had her own expectations as to its ultimate end. But in her book, Statecraft, Strategies for a Changing World, Margaret, for some reasons, would not give full credit to the role the Soviet Union&apos;s new policies played in the global transformation of the late 1980s. Both when we were in power and\u00a0after each of us had stepped down from office, we met many times. Lady Thatcher was certainly a remarkable person and a major political leader. Even though our talks were sometimes quite dramatic and more than lively, I found them intellectually stimulating and admired her deliberate approach to all subjects, her thoughtfulness and her ability to stand her ground \u2013 stubbornly\u00a0but persuasively. Indeed, she had a rare ability to delve deeply and\u00a0thoroughly into the events of the past century, evaluate the scope and meaning of each of them, and analyse the unique features\u00a0of different countries and regions. Her experience as a state leader and her thoughts about the prospects of our changing world had to be appreciated whether one agreed with them or not. I valued my political and human relationship with Margaret, particularly during the most significant years of my time in politics. For me, she was &quot;a person one can deal with&quot;. Our co-operation with Margaret Thatcher went beyond the routine of partnership. Lech Walesa President of Poland, 1990\u20131995 I have good memories of Mrs Thatcher. The first time I met her was when she came to Poland in 1988. The iron curtain still separated east from west. Solidarno\u00b4s\u00b4c was struggling with the communist dictatorship. For us, her visit and spiritual presence were extremely important. It meant that there were world-class politicians supporting our fight for pluralism and economic reform. Thatcher had to be a very brave person to come to the city of Gda\u00b4nsk at that time. She made our struggle for freedom visible to the world. During this visit, Solidarno\u00b4s\u00b4c chaplain Jankowski was hosting a dinner in the rectory house of St Brygida&apos;s church. I remember Thatcher was very much amused by the ample pheasant. It was served with its colourful feathers. She asked if we ate this in Poland that way. We didn&apos;t, of course, but it was the only time we had a laugh. Without her, our fight against communists would have lasted much longer. It would have been confronted with bigger difficulties, if not destruction. Later, whenever I had a meeting with Thatcher, there were always many different matters to be sorted out. Usually, everything would go according to the previously prepared schedule, no improvisation. She had a very pragmatic attitude toward whatever we were doing and there was always a feeling that you couldn&apos;t refuse her. Observing her at work was a great opportunity to learn how to achieve goals. Once she gave me advice: &quot;Write down the 10 steps from where you are now to where you want to be.&quot; It was a good lesson. Thatcher was a very active person with great commitment in her duties. She had a clear vision of the world. She was a distinguished lady who acted in a tight and organised way. The Iron Lady was an unforgettable personality of the past epoch of the cold war. Cynthia Crawford Personal assistant, from 1978 I didn&apos;t meet Thatcher until the day I started work for her, which was the 10 September 1978 when I went to the House of Commons as a package deal with David Wolfson. He was on the board of Great Universal Stores and was trying to help her to win the election. Our relationship sort of built up. She won the election and we went to Downing Street. I was working in the political office, doing whatever came along. I soon started to travel with her. We built up a rapport. It probably came about because I didn&apos;t have to rush home to cook an evening meal for my husband. (He was living in Worcester. I wasn&apos;t with him during the week.) I could stay on and perhaps do something with her in the evening, chat to her or help her sort out her wardrobe. I came home every weekend and she went to Chequers. She was always very sensitive to people who had families. She used to say: &quot;Well, you must go home, dear.&quot; Mine was a supportive role. I was there to make sure her personal life went smoothly. We used to have meetings before every trip. She and I would sit down with the programme and decide what she would wear at each event. In 1987 she was going to Russia for the first time and I had seen a wonderful coat in Aquascutum&apos;s window and I went to get it. A lot of her clothes up until that time had been homemade by a lady. She made all those dresses and blouses with bows and things. Mrs Thatcher went to Russia and she looked absolutely fabulous. I said to her: &quot;If you are going to fight an election in June, why don&apos;t we ask Aquascutum to make you up some working suits.&quot; She agreed, so we ordered these suits. It was when the power shoulders were in and it just revolutionised her. She looked fantastic. She enjoyed all the new outfits and got away from the dresses. She never wears trousers, not even today. She always likes formal clothes, even at home. She hasn&apos;t got a lot of casual clothes. Because her mother was a dressmaker she knew exactly how things should be made, how hems should be turned and how stitching should be done. Every outfit had a name. It was mostly the name of the place where it was first worn, such as Madrid Pink or Prague Green. We might say, &quot;We&apos;ll take Waddesdon Navy&quot; \u2013 because she had several suits in navy. Waddesdon was where she took Mitterrand, and they had a wonderful meal. We knew we were talking about a navy suit that had a trim of a cream collar with navy roses. That was easy because then we knew what we were talking about. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to say, &quot;You can&apos;t go out in that&quot; or &quot;Your makeup isn&apos;t right&quot; or &quot;Your hair looks a mess&quot;. I wouldn&apos;t hesitate. I mean, your best mates tell you, don&apos;t they? We had a few arguments. I usually lost. Not yelling, she didn&apos;t yell. Not about politics. It was about domestic things. She was very forthright and determined about her views. I think she enjoyed being with her political chums more than anything. She had very few close friends; a sister, of course, but few best friends. The Falklands war showed her in her real colours. I used to stay at Downing Street with her, and we used to sit up all night listening to the World Service. We used to sit on the bedroom floor \u2013 the heating would have gone off and there was a two-bar electric fire in the bedroom \u2013 kick our shoes off and relax. When she went up to Northwood for the briefing every day, I used to go to\u00a0bed, but she didn&apos;t. She had practically no sleep for three months. Just catnapping. She was so incredibly strong and determined. Not once did she flag. At Christmas 1988 my husband was knocked down in the road. I had to come straight home. The next day was the Lockerbie disaster. It was a horrific day. Even that night she phoned me to see how my husband was. She was always very sympathetic. I said: &quot;Look, you mustn&apos;t ring me because you have had such a terrible day yourself but she said, &apos;No, I wanted to know how things were&apos;.&quot; I don&apos;t think it ever came across during her premiership that she had this soft, sympathetic side. It was always that she was the Iron Lady. When the Brighton bomb went off, everybody was in a terrible state. We were all just packing up. I think it went off at 2.50am. Somebody said: &quot;What are we going to do with the speech that she was due to give the next day?&quot; We decided we would put it in the handbag \u2013 that was the safest place. Anything that was highly secretive or precious, we would put in her handbag because we knew she was never parted from it. We went to the police station first, then to the police training place at Lewes. We shared a room. I can see it now. It had an avocado bathroom suite. We said a prayer and we lay down, but we didn&apos;t sleep. And, of course, we went back to the hall and she did her speech. It was a very strange and strained night. In 1990, when she didn&apos;t get the vote in the leadership contest, we sat up all night in Paris. She had to go to Versailles after hearing that news and she said she would fight on. When we were leaving for Paris, I had gone to see Denis and said that hopefully we would come back with the right result. But he said to me &quot;she is done for now&quot;. I went to Paris and I never whispered a word of it to anybody. When she found him to say that she hadn&apos;t got it, but she was going to fight on, he still supported her. But in the end, it was him who said. She used to read the odd thriller, especially on holiday. But she was always hungry for news. Whenever we travelled, we had CNN on non-stop. On Saturdays at Chequers, Denis used to insist that she sat down after dinner and they used to like to watch Miss Marple. She was very interested in the garden at Chequers and Downing Street. She put in some lovely rose beds. She didn&apos;t do it physically herself, but she took a great interest in it. And the art. When she became PM she brought in a lot of traditional art: Turners and a Henry Moore. She has always been a very neat person, so she would always spend a little time tidying her wardrobes and cleaning her shoes. That would be relaxation for her. Her sense of humour was very, very dry. In fact, so dry you could miss it. She wasn&apos;t known for her sense of humour. She lived a very serious life and conversation \u2013 well, there was no small talk. She loved discussing politics. She and Ronnie Reagan had this great rapport about politics. She admired him beyond words \u2013 and Gorbachev. She would always say how much she admired him and what he had done for the world, and he adored her. He had a soft voice and he used to talk to her in a wonderful way. Gorbachev was a bit of a flirt, actually, the eyes would be flashing a bit. She didn&apos;t mind that, I mean, nobody minds a bit of flattery, do they? When I read something about her in the newspapers that I knew was incorrect, I felt very annoyed for her. She tended to take those sorts of things far more on the chin. She also never wanted somebody patting her on the back every five minutes because she knew herself that she had done her level\u00a0best. I think her father instilled that in her. Do your very, very best and never follow the crowd. That was her personal policy. I would defend her to the last because she was a complete star in my life. I learned a lot from her, and I tried to do all I could for her. She taught me lots of things, including that you should only do one job at a time and concentrate completely. Whether she was writing a speech or tidying a drawer, it had her total concentration. She taught me that. I think she did a lot for the women of this country and I know that she worked her socks off for the country. She did her utmost for Britain. I don&apos;t think she ever got over the way in which she was deposed by her own party and her own colleagues. It still rankled, and there is no doubt that with the possible exception of Churchill, she was the greatest prime minister of the last century. In my book, she was the greatest prime minister. Carol Thatcher  Daughter  For a workaholic, No 10 was the perfect home: a staircase of just 17 steps led from the private flat to the prime minister&apos;s study on the first floor. It had to be the shortest commute in London. The flat quickly dispelled the popular image of grand living. It was converted out of attic rooms during Neville Chamberlain&apos;s time. When it was portrayed in a Bond film, we all looked enviously because it was much more glamorous than the real thing. I recall domestic arrangements being very do-it-yourself. Often, guests who came up to the flat for an early-evening gin and tonic would find one or other of my parents co-ordinating glasses, with one of us racing down the stairs to the catering kitchen to fill up the ice bucket from the machine there because no one had thought to refill the ice trays in our own freezer. My father wasn&apos;t keen on ice in drinks, though. &quot;Dilutes it,&quot; he used to claim. My mother regarded food simply as fuel and had no claims to being a foodie. The late playwright Ronnie Millar, who used to come in for speech-writing sessions often on a Sunday evening used to raise his eyebrows and mutter: &quot;Lasagne again.&quot; My mother had total tunnel vision when it came to work. As kids, my bother and I were watching a pop music show on TV while she was doing constituency paperwork in the same room. I asked if she wanted me to turn the volume down. No, she replied, she hadn&apos;t realised it was on. When I was at boarding school she was meticulous about turning up to school functions but always had a file of\u00a0paperwork to sign or read when there was a lull in proceedings. I think she was the most practical, efficient and organised person I have known. I once read that she was described as &quot;fanatically tidy&quot; while\u00a0I\u00a0was &quot;fanatically messy&quot;. I\u00a0couldn&apos;t argue. Lord Powell Private secretary to the prime minister, 1983-1990  You can argue about whether Margaret Thatcher was our greatest peacetime prime minister of the last century \u2013 my own view \u2013 or a partisan, narrow-minded shrew, which would seem to be the opinion of many Guardian readers. But no one can dispute that she was the most energetic PM in British history. She never stopped. The working day began at 6am with Farming Today and rarely ended until the last red box was completed at 2am or 3am. Weekends were, in her view, an annoying intrusion to the routine, a problem solved by turning Chequers into a second office. Holidays were viewed with distaste and punctuated with eager phone calls seeking an excuse to return to London once the obligatory photograph on the beach with Denis and a borrowed dog had been snapped. Others were expected to observe the same. One No 10 private secretary had to absent himself once on a Friday for a family event and, as luck would have it, Mrs Thatcher asked for him. When it was explained that he was taking the day off, she ever afterwards would remark plaintively: &quot;Of course, Tim doesn&apos;t work on Fridays.&quot; Ceaseless activity went with excessive punctuality. Her official car often had to pull into the side on approaching a town, because we were too early and the police escort was not in place, leaving startled citizens wondering what the prime minister was doing in their local layby. The record was achieved on a visit to Prague, when she arrived early at the president&apos;s palace, whereupon the guard of honour snapped to attention and the band struck up the national anthems. Mrs Thatcher began to inspect the Guard of Honour. The only person missing was President Havel. He materialised a few minutes later, at the double and pulling on his jacket. Whether this perpetuum mobile was the best way to run a government is something that historians and psychiatrists can argue over endlessly. But it suited Mrs Thatcher&apos;s permanently striving personality. I also recall most sharply her intensity. Mrs Thatcher is a believer, a crusader, whose mission as prime minister was to galvanise Britain out of the stupefied state into which it had descended in the 70s. This passionate intensity carried through into her style of working. She could turn almost anything into an argument, because that was how she arrived at her views. It was something that did not appeal to public school-educated male cabinet, who were mostly brought up to defer politely to ladies. She irritated the hell out of them, but her style was an intrinsic part of her personality: I argue therefore I am. Together with her unflinching will power, it played a crucial role in the success of her policies. As PM she never stood on her dignity or became grand. In rare moments of enforced inactivity, she would sit on my desk and answer the phone. You would hear an alarmed Whitehall official stammer that he must have got the wrong extension. &quot;If you want Charles, you can&apos;t speak to him, he&apos;s too\u00a0busy,&quot; she would say, putting down the receiver. She was remarkably non-judgmental about her colleagues&apos; sexual peccadilloes, though could also be disarmingly naive. I recall her once snatching a copy of the hated Private Eye, in which I&apos;d been reading about the Ugandan activities of a prominent member of her party. She handed it back triumphantly: &quot;It&apos;s completely untrue, I know for a fact he&apos;s never been to Uganda.&quot; Yes, Prime Minister. Geoffrey Howe Chancellor of the exchequer, 1979-83; foreign secretary, 1983-89; leader of the House of Commons, 1989-90 If you look at anything Margaret Thatcher wrote or the speeches she made before she became leader of the party, there&apos;s nothing outstanding or distinctive about them. She really only made an impact on us in the party when she was, to our surprise, elected leader. Put simply, nobody thought a woman could win \u2013 and then suddenly, there she was. I remember when she appeared for the first time at the meeting of the 1922 committee, this frail little woman in the middle of an all-male gathering, but rather proud of herself. And all of us surprised to find ourselves forming a quasi-Elizabethan court around her. But she began to gain confidence from that point. When she and I found ourselves beleaguered after the 1981 budget \u2013 it was fiercely attacked on the day after its delivery \u2013 she was the only voice to speak up in defence of it. We turned out to be right on that. The following year came the Falklands, about which she was decisive; almost a lone cabinet voice in insisting that we had to recapture the islands. After those two events her confidence had grown hugely, and her personality was solidifying in people&apos;s minds. Margaret became recognised as a dominant figure on the world stage before she was at home. The chattering classes in Britain could never accept how well respected and admired she was abroad. Initially this was because she was a very early and therefore very striking example of a woman prime minister. I remember when we went to our first world summit together in Japan in 1979, she was the only woman there. While she was speaking, I noticed that the audience consisted of a large number of Japanese women, who had come in from neighbouring offices to see her. You could see them really being\u00a0wowed. Several years later we went to Moscow, and she was a phenomenon, this instantly recognisable woman getting out of her car \u2013 which Russian leaders didn&apos;t do \u2013 to go to meet the crowds. It made a huge impression. The fact that she also had a very dynamic authority first became recognised, crucially, at her meeting with Gorbachev in 1984. We had then been working together in foreign affairs for 18 months. And we had decided that we had to find some way of getting inside the Soviet system, of persuading the leaders that it didn&apos;t make sense to maintain this hostility. We were lucky to identify Gorbachev as the man who was going to be chosen as leader. To be present at that first meeting between Margaret and Gorbachev was an extraordinary experience. We were struck by how he was unlike any Soviet leader that we had met. He had a warmth that engaged people, and we could see a relationship of candour springing up between them in those first few hours. And then she ended with that great comment when he left: &quot;Here is a man with whom I can do business.&quot; (The &quot;I&quot;, of course, is important.) Within a week we left to sign the Hong Kong agreement with China, and the following Saturday we were in Washington to meet Reagan. Frankly, Margaret&apos;s most important contribution to the world was her ability to convince Reagan, with whom she had a very good relationship, that Gorbachev was a guy with whom he could do business, too. I don&apos;t think Margaret consciously exploited her gender, so much as it was something of which her interlocutors were always aware. I remember a European summit meeting in Copenhagen at which we were trying \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 to work on reform of the common agricultural policy, and which we had addressed many times before. It was about 12.20am, a few days before Christmas, and we still hadn&apos;t reached agreement, so the chairman called it to a close. Suddenly Mitterrand launched into a great monologue about how we had reached the end of the road, we shall have to consider if we can ever manage this, and so on. When he finished, Margaret piped up, to my astonishment, and said: &quot;No, it hasn&apos;t been like that at all, President Mitterrand. It&apos;s been a very good meeting. We haven&apos;t quite solved it, but we will. Cheer up, Monsieur.&quot; A moment&apos;s pause, and then he said: &quot;I sometimes think Mrs Thatcher is even more beguiling when she is saying yes than when she is saying no.&quot; He was reacting to her as Madame Thatcher, not that she was consciously playing a female role. Though I can&apos;t imagine anyone other than Margaret making that kind of gesture. Looking at it overall, Margaret and I probably always had a slightly uneasy partnership, but a very creative one. Eventually, every meeting that took place in Whitehall or Westminster was subconsciously attended, unseen and unspoken, by Margaret Thatcher. The discussion would always come around somehow to: how will this play with the prime minister? That gradually grew, to the point where she was so accustomed to getting her own way that she became overconfident; less and less dependent on consultation with colleagues, more and more dependent on a narrow circle. It tends to happen. It happened to Ted Heath. It happened to Tony Blair. In Margaret&apos;s case, she became prepared to test her will to destruction, and that&apos;s when she began losing colleagues. First Michael Heseltine walked out, followed by Leon Brittan, then Nigel Lawson, then me. My resignation speech, in November 1990, was made with genuine regret. I have often said that I was seeking a change in policy not a change in prime minister. But I suppose I was beginning to realise that that was an unlikely outcome, just as others were recognising that her commitment to the poll tax was almost certainly taking us to disaster. It was a real rupture. We had worked together as long as most marriages last \u2013 since 1975 \u2013 and it had been a fruitful relationship, because while there were disagreements, our instincts were the same in many ways. I didn&apos;t always win all the arguments, obviously: some of them I had to wait a day or two to win. The interesting thing is what would have happened if Ian Gow hadn&apos;t been murdered by the IRA in July 1990. Ian was Margaret&apos;s closest friend and mine, and he was always anxious that we shouldn&apos;t be torn apart from each other. If he had survived the outcome might have been different? I don&apos;t know. Shirley Williams Secretary of State for Education, 1976-79; co-founder of SDP, 1981 Margaret Thatcher was neither the cleverest nor the most eloquent politician of her generation. But she was without question the most determined. At a time of doubt and disillusion, her unswerving belief in her own convictions proved to be her most important characteristic. Her values were simple and straightforward, based on the austere Methodism of her childhood \u2013 hard work, self-discipline and thrift. There was little room for fun. On paper, Margaret Roberts had little going for her, other than determination. Indeed, there were three strikes against her as a future politician. The location of her birth was the remote Lincolnshire market town of Grantham. The family lived modestly and had few, if any, influential friends. She came from the stratum of honest tradesmen, from which Tory agents and local councillors might be recruited, but rarely MPs. And she was a woman, at a time when the most that women could aspire to was to be &quot;the statutory woman&quot;, the obligatory female member of government who made no trouble but could be called on to talk about &quot;women&apos;s issues&quot;. To get to Oxford from her grammar school was the first of her triumphs. To do so, she had coached herself in Latin and chemistry, her chosen subject. To become chairman of the Oxford University Conservative Association, the second woman so to do, was another. Neither achievement impressed Oxford&apos;s imperturbable dons. The principal of her college, Somerville, the distinguished, radical haematologist Janet Vaughan, dismissed her as &quot;a second-rate mind&quot;, the ultimate academic put-down. Like Tory party grandees 25 years later, the dons underestimated her. They failed to see the engine that drove her, the single-minded passionate will to power. To determination was added resentment; as prime minister, she cherished no great affection for the ancient universities. Launched on to the political stage by a brilliant campaign in the safe Labour seat of Dartford, Margaret Roberts began to act more and more like a Tory lady. She blossomed into dramatic hats, gloves and the other appurtenances of a rising political star. Her new husband, Denis, old enough and successful enough to be amused rather than threatened by his wife&apos;s success, became her emotional and financial anchor. Over the years, though they rarely shared the most critical moments of their lives (when she told him she was running for the leadership, he asked, &quot;Leadership of what?&quot;), she became increasingly dependent on his counsel and support. As a secretary of state for education and science, Thatcher loyally carried out her party&apos;s policies, but did not much like them. She put up with being patronised and disregarded by her prime minister, Ted Heath. She bore the popular abuse she received for removing free milk from primary schools as &quot;Thatcher, the Milk-Snatcher&quot;, though the policy was the treasury&apos;s, not hers. So when it came to the leadership election, most Conservative MPs bought Airey Neave&apos;s reassuring message that her candidature was just intended to shake up the unpopular Heath. The MPs, too, had underestimated her. Like the guns of Singapore, their weapons were pointing in the wrong direction. A conviction politician, Thatcher got rid of &quot;the wets&quot; as soon as she decently could. She had never had time for one-nation Toryism. In her autobiography, The Path to Power, there are hardly any references to Rab Butler, the architect of the postwar Tory party, nor even to his great 1944 Education Act. Thatcher&apos;s femininity was her secret weapon. Always elegant, always formidable, but also capable of personal kindness to her staff and helpers, she understood Tory men. Most of them had been brought up by fearsome women of authority: nannies, matrons, distant and detached mothers, whom one did not challenge or disobey. A woman leader baffled them. They simply did not know how to relate to her, and they were uncomfortable with anything that looked like competition or defiance. Over three administrations, Thatcher gradually established unquestioned command, disregarding her cabinet, and becoming a kind of secular monarch. She became more remote, out-of-touch, capable of the absurd folly of the poll tax. She who had treated her colleagues with so little mercy received none from them at the end. Tony Benn Former Labour MP and cabinet member Margaret Thatcher was a very powerful, rightwing force in society. She followed her beliefs and had clear objectives. Her policy was to reverse the trends in modern politics that were made possible by the trade unions being legalised. She decided to eradicate the power of the unions, undermine local government and privatise assets \u2013 and these were the three policies of the labour movement. It was a major attack on democracy and at first it carried some public support, but then it became unstuck, and in the end, it was rejected. But ideas always come back and the modern Tory party is influenced by her ideas. Although I thought she was wrong, she said what she meant and meant what she said. It was not about style with her; it was substance \u2013 I don&apos;t think she listened to spin doctors, she just had a clear idea and followed it through. I remember her at the funeral of MP Eric Heffer. I was asked to make a speech and as I was waiting, there was someone behind me coughing. It was Mrs Thatcher, and at the end I thanked her for coming and she burst into tears. She had come out of respect for someone whose opinions she disagreed with. Kenneth Clarke  Health secretary, 1988-90; education secretary, 1990-92 I was a government whip in the early 1970s, and Margaret was secretary of state for education. She was a tough and striking character, and I got on perfectly all right with her, but I became aware that Ted Heath was thinking of sacking her. Margaret had become involved in a silly row, where the Labour party and the newspapers decided that taking milk from schoolchildren was a dreadful, Victorian thing to do. It plainly existed for the benefit of the farming industry \u2013 it was a way of dumping milk on schools, and no longer had anything to do with the avoidance of rickets \u2013 but she became an object of criticism. We were all aghast that Ted was thinking of sacking the only woman in the cabinet. He was persuaded not to, but no doubt he occasionally looks back and regrets that he did not have the foresight to get rid of the person who proved to be his most formidable rival. When we went into opposition in 1974, there was huge pressure to get rid of Ted. Many people wanted Keith Joseph, on the party&apos;s right, to stand. Keith was a brilliant but indecisive character; he went through agonies, and then made a somewhat ill-judged speech [on sexual promiscuity and social deprivation] which, in the stupid daily atmosphere of politics, was instantly assumed to have cost him his chance. Margaret had been close politically to Keith, so there was a rush to get her to stand. The result was that Margaret was the only opponent Heath had on the first ballot, and she came ahead for the simple reason that she wasn&apos;t him. She gathered an enormous protest vote that had no ideological content, which made her unbeatable in the second ballot. So Margaret became one of the most unexpected leaders of the party that we had ever had. As opposition leader, she had a rocky ride, because she had not fully matured as a politician. She was a bit typecast; people used to make rude remarks about her twinset and pearls \u2013 she epitomised a rightwing, Daily Mail-reading, suburban housewife. She was subject to a great deal of muttering: the other members of her shadow cabinet had all been shocked by her becoming leader; a lot of the grandees deeply resented that she was leading the party and they were not. She was a difficult woman to get to know, and I&apos;m not sure I ever did. I combined my job with being a barrister, and one day, coming back from court in the West Midlands, I fell asleep on the train. I woke up to find, opposite me, Margaret and Ian Gow, who had got on at some station and were teasing me. But she offered me a lift in her car from the station. She took me back to her room in the House of Commons, and offered me a cup of tea. She was wandering around, finding dirty teacups, washing them in the sink, throwing a tea-towel at me and getting me to dry them \u2013 she was remarkably feminine, and normal. We were all believers in free-market economics; we all thought the trade unions were a dreadful, over-powerful vested interest. We all thought we should stop bailing out lame-duck industries and pouring the taxpayer&apos;s money into over-manned, overpaid and inefficient nationalised industries. But once we came to government, in 1979, if it hadn&apos;t been for Margaret, I&apos;m not sure many of us would have had the courage of our convictions. She gave us all the courage to do what we all believed ought to be done. Over time, we pushed the boat out further and further, and became more and more unpopular with the public \u2013 but she made us put our tin hats on and get on with it. To our astonishment, we survived as a government. The poll tax was her undoing. I always said it was great fun working in her government so long as you could stand the hassle. But unfortunately, as always happens if people stay in office for too long, she got carried away with her own infallibility. The poll tax was the worst example of that. She got some sycophantic young men around her, whom I will not name because they are friends of mine, and she wouldn&apos;t discuss it with her more senior colleagues, who disagreed with her. We&apos;d had many policies that were unpopular, but many of us knew in our bones that the critics were right on this: it was an uncollectable tax. She&apos;d always flown by the seat of her pants, by her gut instinct \u2013 but that time her gut instinct was wrong. As soon as any prime minister starts thinking of his [or her] role in history, it&apos;s the beginning of disaster. But I don&apos;t think she did that much: she probably took the woman of destiny bit for granted. Although she did once come out in cabinet with a bizarre statement: &quot;Why do I have to do everything in this government?&quot; To which I think I wasn&apos;t the only person sitting round the table thinking: &quot;The trouble is, Margaret, that you believe that you do have to. And you shouldn&apos;t. And you can&apos;t.&quot; At the end, when she was talked into seeing the cabinet one by one, she saw me first because somebody had told her that I was the most vehement [in believing] that she couldn&apos;t go on. She tried to jolly me out of it, so I explained forcefully, as is my way, that in my opinion she&apos;d lost and ought to stand down. She accused me of being defeatist; I said that she had been defeated. I didn&apos;t seen her much [after that]. She never came to terms with losing the leadership. She became embittered and persuaded herself that it had all been treachery and some kind of plot, which was paranoid nonsense. Whenever I ask myself the mystifying question of why the Conservatives, the natural governing party for centuries, dissolved into civil war and swung so violently to the nationalist right, I think that in some mysterious way it goes back to the trauma of Margaret&apos;s defeat. I think there was a section of the rightwing of the party that never came to terms with it; that believed the stuff about plots, and regarded John Major&apos;s government, in some peculiar way, as a betrayal of Margaret&apos;s legacy \u2013 when it followed Thatcherite policies pretty consistently. What we tried to be in Major&apos;s government was Thatcherite with a human face. But we were destroyed from within by people who considered themselves the most loyal followers of Margaret. It was left to Tony\u00a0Blair to take over Thatcherism with a human face. She was one of our great recent prime ministers. She&apos;d be outdone by Churchill, and possibly, although he was a much more flawed character, by Lloyd George. But anybody writing the history of the 20th century in Britain will regard Thatcher as one of the dominant political personalities, and her era as one of the decisive phases in our history. Which is why it was such a privilege to serve in her government; as you may have gathered, I found it rather enjoyable. Nancy Reagan US first lady, 1981-1989 We met for the first time in London. My husband was not yet in office. She and my husband shared the same views and convictions. They were political soulmates when it came to reducing government, expanding economic freedom and ending the cold war. For eight years as president, Ronnie never had a closer [international] ally than Margaret Thatcher. But Margaret was not just an ally, she was also a dear and trusted friend. They disagreed over the Falkland Islands, but it didn&apos;t harm their friendship at all. Ronnie and I always enjoyed our visits with Margaret and Denis \u2013 whether at the White House, Camp David, our ranch in California, or No 10. Ronnie and I happened to be in London at the time she stepped down as prime minister. She came to our hotel to visit, and she was obviously very sad. I think that was one of her lowest moments. But she was a strong woman and soon returned to her normal self. Her lowest moment was certainly losing\u00a0Denis. She was a constant source of strength\u00a0and inspiration during Ronnie&apos;s \u00a0illness. As our lives changed through the years, our friendship did not. Margaret represented strength, warmth and intelligence. Nigel Lawson Secretary of state for energy, 1981-83; chancellor of the exchequer, 1983-89 Margaret Thatcher was a womanly woman and always considered it important to use her woman&apos;s skills to the utmost. Before sitting down she always had a little movement \u2013 and I&apos;ve never seen another woman do it \u2013 of hitching up her skirt, so she wasn&apos;t sitting on it. Her bum was sitting on the chair \u2013 well, her knickers, of course \u2013 so when she got up her skirt was uncreased. She always thought things out. She was a great details person. Margaret felt closer to the woman who goes out to work than the one who stays at home. I don&apos;t think she had a great deal of sympathy for the housewife. She felt she was part of a sisterhood of so-called working wives. Women have many great qualities and Margaret had a lot, but there is one male quality that is usually important in politics and that she lacked \u2013 clubbability. Mitterrand described her as having the mouth of Marilyn Monroe and eyes of Caligula. Whether he meant it or whether he was trying to charm her in order to undermine her resistance to whatever it was he wished to do, I don&apos;t know. I think she could turn it on if she wanted to, but sexiness wasn&apos;t the most obvious thing about her. She was also extremely headmistressy. She never bullied me. The only one she really bullied was Geoffrey Howe. Listening was never her strongest attribute, but she was infinitely better in the first half of her premiership. It was a gradual process. The real deterioration set in at Christmas 1987, when Willie Whitelaw had to resign on health grounds. That made a huge difference. Until then, his presence at her side concentrated her mind. There had never been a cabinet with so many Jewish men \u2013 me, Michael Howard, Leon Brittan. I wondered why, and the conclusion I came to is not that she had a thing for Jews, but that she was one of those rare politicians without the faintest whiff of antisemitism. Margaret&apos;s mind operated on at least two levels. There was the saloon-bar populist, but there was also the sophisticated, calculating politician. She\u00a0switched from one mode to the other. She wasn&apos;t an intellectual in the sense that Keith Joseph was. She was more like a clever lawyer, quick at picking up a brief, and mastering all the detail. She liked the company of intellectuals, enjoyed the debate, but she thought of herself more as a woman of action. Margaret&apos;s political philosophy was shaped greatly by her family background, particularly her father. She was very close to him, but not her mother, who didn&apos;t go out to work. She had a protestant work ethic and felt that everybody should have the opportunity to make their own way by their own efforts, and that no one should stand in the way of people bettering themselves. So when groups appeared to have ancient privileges of one kind or another, she would go for them \u2013 such as the restrictive practices of the legal profession. She wasn&apos;t a class warrior. One wouldn&apos;t say Margaret was totally humourless, but her sense of humour was not highly developed. She\u00a0did once make me laugh. I showed\u00a0her a new commemorative coin, and said approvingly at the head on the coin: &quot;Ooh, she looks just like Rita\u00a0Hayworth!&quot; Paddy Ashdown Leader of the Liberal Democrats, 1988-1999 I didn&apos;t like her politics. I always regarded Margaret Thatcher as a one-man demolition squad. She levelled the rickety old buildings of corporate state Britain, brutally. She tore them down. There is a constructive thing about clearing a space for a new building. She was a destroyer. Not a wilful one, she was a destroyer with a purpose. But she found it impossible to build on the ground she had levelled. It was clear that if we on the left had had the same degree of intellectual rigour about our ideas as she had about hers, however much I didn&apos;t like most of them, we wouldn&apos;t have suffered so badly. We sat there and we believed in the 1980s that we were on an easy conveyor belt, which was always moving towards a more leftwing, more socialist and social justice-based agenda. And she and the people with her spotted the laziness and the flaws \u2013 the worm in the apple \u2013 and ruthlessly exposed it in a highly effective manner. I fought, sometimes mistakenly against elements of her agenda, including some of her economic liberalisation agenda, but there&apos;s no question that she was one of the great prime ministers of our century. I remember saying three or four years before her exit from Downing Street that in politics at this level everything always ends in tears and people said: &quot;No, Mrs Thatcher won&apos;t end in tears.&quot; And of course, she did. She wasn&apos;t intellectually a forceful person. She was forceful because of her character but that was enough. If you don&apos;t have courage, all the other qualities you may have \u2013 good strategic sense and oratory etc \u2013 vanish like the morning dew when you need it. But she had it. Her other quality was of leadership of the sort that is rare in senior leaders, but which is part of the Sandhurst training for 2nd lieutenants. You&apos;d be in the Commons at 3am or 4am and David Steel and Neil Kinnock would be safely tucked up in bed, and Maggie would walk in to support her backbenchers. She tied people to her with genuine bonds of affection because she appeared in the frontline when life was tough and inspired her troops. I&apos;m told she once said about me: &quot;Ashdown, glittering army career? Can&apos;t imagine. What he&apos;s doing in the Liberal Democrats. Should be a Tory.&quot; David Owen Leader of the SDP, 1983-87, 1988-1990 After decades of creeping corporatism and relative economic decline, Margaret Thatcher&apos;s premiership championed radical market-led economic reforms that went on to become the foundation of our national economic prosperity. It was profoundly in the national interest that through most of that period the SDP, as a new force in British politics, reinforced the better parts of her counter-revolution. We in the SDP had serious disagreements with her over a broad range of issues from the NHS, apartheid, the poll tax and her lack of interest in alleviating, let alone eradicating, poverty at home and overseas. Yet helping to sustain her economic, monetary and industrial trade union reforms was worthwhile. She required guts to do it \u2013 her single greatest quality \u2013 and she deserved some cross-party support, particularly on two occasions: the Falklands and the miners strike, when her personal resolve made all the difference between victory or defeat. Thatcher would not have remained prime minister if General Galtieri&apos;s forces had not been thrown off the Falklands. It is easy to forget that in the first two weeks of 1982 her government was in trouble. Two opinion polls put the SDP-Liberal Alliance ahead at 34% and 36% respectively, with the Tories coming second and third respectively. Her concern for the sailors and their families after the bombing of HMS Sheffield was palpable. There was understandable nervousness on occasions but her nerve held on military matters and diplomatic negotiations. As a result, and despite the pre-war failures of her government&apos;s policies, the 1983 general election result was left beyond doubt. But not only did her actions save her premiership, it meant that those in control of Labour party policy, campaigning with CND over cruise missiles and against Nato&apos;s nuclear strategy, were never given the opportunity to prosper, as they would have done in the aftermath of a Falklands defeat. The second battle was a domestic one with Arthur Scargill and this, too, had to be fought to a clear-cut victory. The 1972 national miners&apos; strike was the first since 1926 and it was vindicated by Lord Wilberforce&apos;s 17% pay award. The second miners&apos; strike in 1974 was, however, not justified and blatantly political. Though it helped Harold Wilson defeat Edward Heath it fed industrial militancy and led to the winter of discontent and the Labour government&apos;s defeat in 1979. What is all too often forgotten was that there was a threatened third miners&apos; strike in 1981. It was one of Thatcher&apos;s wisest decisions to pay up and settle with the NUM president Joe Gormley, while building up coal reserves and planning for an inevitable confrontation with his successor, Scargill. When Scargill called a national strike without the traditional pit-head ballot in March 1984, she was ready for him. The old traditional Conservatives&apos; instinct for compromise over industrial disputes associated with Walter Monckton, Harold Macmillan and Heath was tested in October, when the pit deputies&apos; union Nacod&apos;s threatened strike action. I talked to Thatcher about my concern that any compromise then would have fatal long-term consequences, given Scargill&apos;s capacity to present such an outcome as a vindication of his stand. She made it plain that despite the department of energy&apos;s attitudes, there must be no question of letting him off the hook. Many blamed her when we saw the sad spectacle of decent miners being forced to trudge back to work with defeat on their faces, but without that result, the intimidation and violence on the picket line would have been seen to have triumphed. It was a tragedy for her and the country that she did not broaden her vision on the back of those two great victories and develop a more sensitive social-market approach, and step down with dignity on her 10th anniversary. Edwina Currie Junior health minister, 1986-1988 I first saw Margaret Thatcher in the flesh at her first party conference as leader in 1975. I was Birmingham&apos;s youngest councillor and thrilled at the idea of a woman at the top. On the podium she seemed tiny and vulnerable. She had buck teeth, frizzy hair and wore terrible clothes with frills and bows. At 49, earnest and nervous, a scientist and a mother, she brought to mind the pioneering heroism of a Madame Curie, the dogged faith of a Joan of Arc. By the time I entered parliament in 1983 the transformation was complete. Margaret was the boss and enjoying every minute. I heard her say in one interview: &quot;I don&apos;t mind what my ministers say as long as they do as I tell them.&quot; It was a revealing remark with not a hint of irony. Had anyone dared to challenge her, she would have been astonished at the notion that a cabinet divided could rule the country better. She was feared, but she was also loved. Little things mattered. Even her manner of appointing ministers had warmth. On the day in September 1986 when she called me in to join the government, she opened the door herself and whisked me away from the press, then talked quietly about how the job might be done. Soon the doors opened to a dozen excited new junior ministers, each with a drink in hand. We discovered Denis&apos;s influence in the hefty triples pressed on us. As we headed outside, we were a very merry bunch. Her image is of a domineering matron of rigid moral standards, but in practice, she was more easygoing than that. I never heard her criticising colleagues whose marriages had broken down; she was, of course, the second Mrs Thatcher. In her heyday, she treated every encounter as a learning opportunity. At one reception, she suddenly said: &quot;Edwina, explain how my constituents in Finchley gain from yours in Derby having a new hospital when the waiting lists in London are so long.&quot; I flannelled, then offered: &quot;If Derbyshire people can be treated nearer home, they&apos;ll come off those lists and your own constituents will be treated quicker.&quot; She nodded thoughtfully. Later I heard her use the argument at the dispatch box. Pity they don&apos;t make them like that any more. Steve Kemp   National secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers I have nothing but contempt for Margaret Thatcher and I&apos;m sure she has nothing but contempt for me and the miners in the NUM. There was hatred on my part and there still is. I was 23 at the time of the strike in 1984 \u2013 I had started down the pits on my 18th birthday at South Kirkby colliery. I was politicised long before. I didn&apos;t have a family then, but lived with my partner, who was a receptionist in the NHS. That helped financially. I couldn&apos;t afford the mortgage. But there was community support \u2013 soup kitchens, people handing out food and helping raise money. Miners died on the picket line. The consequences of the pit closures on communities are horrendous and ongoing. From Kent to the north of Scotland, there are old mining communities living in depravation, at a huge social cost. Local MPs would agree the catastrophic effects are there for everyone to see. I will never forgive the government of the day \u2013 it was heartbreaking for the men and their areas. Our communities understood the doctrine from Thatcher: they knew it was about the break-up of communities, the break-up of society, and the fact you shouldn&apos;t show feeling for others. But they also knew that she wasn&apos;t going to succeed, they responded against it. Norman Tebbitt  Employment secretary, 1981-83; trade and industry secretary, 1983-85; Tory chairman, 1985-87 After the 1974 elections it became obvious that Ted Heath had to go, and Airey Neave persuaded me to campaign for Margaret. The idea of any woman leading a political party was unusual, and to lead the Conservative party was even more unusual, and an awful lot of people didn&apos;t believe it was possible. If there had been a man with the same qualities as her I would have gone for him because it would have just been easier. But quite clearly, she was the best man among the candidates. What also attracted me to her was that she did not believe that trade unions achieving high-wage awards or employers achieving large price rises were causes of inflation. She correctly concluded by then that the cause of inflation was government, and that governments accommodated high-wage awards and accommodated upward pressure on prices by printing money and that came out as inflation. Therefore, what governments had to do was to say no, and people had to accommodate themselves to this different world. It was a revolutionary doctrine. She was a revolutionary, or perhaps, more accurately, a counter-revolutionary. To some extent, we were stealing Labour&apos;s clothes. If you go back to the ethics of old Labour, it was about achieving at school and fighting your way out. If you&apos;d said to somebody in the 1920s, say in the Welsh valleys or in Rochdale, &quot;Well, you better bloody get on your bike and do something about this&quot;, they would have understood precisely what you meant. So in a way, Thatcherism was going back to that grassroots feeling of working-class people who wanted to get on. When the going got tough, she never panicked. In 1981, an awful year in which high wages and low productivity meant labour was being shed at a formidable rate, and unemployment rose to more than three million. Until then, it had been assumed you couldn&apos;t let unemployment go above one million. She thought we had to grit our teeth and get through it, and it would turn. And because people realised she was not going to bend, they began to adjust. It was a combination of strength and obstinacy. Heath was obstinate, but he didn&apos;t have strength. One of the problems about being a woman in politics is that a man can shout, but if a woman increases the volume of her voice she tends to squawk, so she got a great deal of help in how to raise her voice without squawking. Thatcher showed that a woman could do anything, but she wasn&apos;t a feminist \u2013 although she did sometimes make it obvious that she thought men were the weaker sex because they couldn&apos;t multitask. We had some brutal disagreements \u2013 about whether to make strikes in the essential services illegal (I thought not, and eventually won), and about whether to close down British Leyland (again, I thought no, and won). You had to have a good argument and stand your ground. I was never frightened of her. I used to look at it this way: the worst that could happen was she could fire me. She once said: &quot;As long as you and I and Nigel [Lawson] stick together, we can do anything. And then, of course, she lost both of us and it became difficult.&apos; I wanted her to go on, but she had let things slip, and lost control. I took the view, like any good lieutenant, even if you know the battle is lost, you still stand there fighting, and you have to be there to be cut down at the end. That night she told me she was going to go, and I told her to sleep on it. But she insisted, and I finished up that night helping her write the speech that she made. It was an extraordinary speech. It wasn&apos;t politics that day, it was grand opera, and the music should have been by Verdi, and Maria Callas should have sung the role of the prime minister. But there wasn&apos;t a decent role for Pavarotti, because all the men looked such wimps. She never recovered (from being kicked out). I think it destroyed her. She took a hell of a lot of stress in her years as prime minister. You can only feed your body adrenalin for a limited number of years before it takes its toll. I think she always felt bad about Brighton because clearly the intention was to murder her, but she walked away and a number of her friends died instead. She didn&apos;t talk about it. We didn&apos;t talk about the impact it had on my life. I suspect in many ways we were alike in that way: &quot;So your wife is paralysed and you&apos;ve had bloody great bits knocked off you, and you&apos;ve been in hospital for two or three months, but we don&apos;t really make a fuss about it, do we?&quot; I think we both grew up in that school where you don&apos;t complain. Roy Hattersley Deputy leader of Labour opposition, 1983-1992 In 1973, when I was shadow education secretary and Margaret Thatcher was the real thing, the Tory government published a white paper called A Framework for Expansion. It announced great increases in spending on schools and universities and confirmed the new generosity with a statistical appendix that I couldn&apos;t understand. So, in preparation for the House of Commons debate, I consulted Maurice Peston \u2013 not then a peer, merely a professor of economics. He said the figures were phoney. Impatient at my inability to understand his explanation, Peston drafted me a paragraph that he suggested I read to the House of Commons. I stuttered it out with as much conviction as I could muster. There was an immediate explosion of incredulous contempt. The notion that Thatcher had got her figures wrong was regarded as ridiculous by everyone \u2013 including the education correspondents of the major newspapers. Stuart Maclure, editor of the TES and doyenne of education journalists, told me that he proposed to discover the extent of my error by consulting the only real expert on the subject \u2013 Professor Maurice Peston. The result of the Peston adjudication was a unanimous outcry among education correspondents that the government had got it wrong. Nobody said that I had got it right. I wrote to Thatcher demanding an apology. She didn&apos;t reply. I challenged her to a debate. She didn&apos;t respond. One day, I met her in the lobby of the House of Commons and said: &quot;Sooner or later, you&apos;ll have to admit that you were wrong.&quot; She looked me in the eye and said: &quot;Never! Never! Never!&quot; When, 10 years later, I became deputy leader of the Labour party, I occasionally stood in for Neil Kinnock at prime minister&apos;s questions. Another peer (CCP Williams of Oxford and Essex) suggested that I should approach her in the manner of a spin bowler. My first question should, metaphorically, be a slow, long hop, which she hit for six. The second should be cunningly disguised so that, when she attempted a second boundary, she was bowled. More often than not, she scored off both my deliveries. But occasionally, it worked. Once I persuaded her to denounce me for suggesting that the poll tax assessment was inaccurate and was then able to tell her that one of her ministers had admitted it that morning. Her reply was that I was &quot;trying to cause trouble&quot;. Simon Hoggart in this newspaper wrote that it was the nicest thing anyone had ever said about me. Her last speech in the House of Commons \u2013 on the day she gave up the premiership \u2013 was not half as good as people make out. It was the way in which she opened the debate on the Westland affair that left the most lasting impression on me. Knowing she was in trouble, Thatcher simply reminded her backbenchers that she was the champion of the ideology that they supported. That was, of course, her strength, and her contribution to British history. She changed the ideological climate. After Thatcher, nearly everyone hated public expenditure and loved the free market. Bernard Ingham Margaret Thatcher&apos;s chief press secretary, 1979-90 There have been only two great prime ministers since the war \u2013 Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher. Both changed the nature of Britain. Attlee established a postwar consensus, of which Thatcher was a part. It was increasingly abused and held to ransom and in the end Thatcher broke with it. There had to be a better way of governing Britain, she said. There was, though it earned her the lasting enmity of vested interests and our so-called liberal elite, whom she\u00a0proved wrong. Attlee did not become a great prime minister by being nice. Nor did Thatcher. She was, and had to be, tough-minded, determined, and courageous to change anything, given the British establishment was comprehensively defeated by 1979. All they could handle was accelerating decline. Her achievement was greater for four reasons. We had long since seen the death of deference to authority, which helped Attlee. The pace of government and politics had greatly accelerated, thanks to the technology of travel and communications. The competitive pressures of a more self-confident media had become explosive. And her sex was provocation enough for some without her antipathy to the politically correct movement, to whom her supposed lack of compassion was a red rag. She was secure in her ideology. Her programme flowed naturally from her less-government-more-personal-responsibility philosophy. She was macho in a man&apos;s world, determined to work men under the table; fierce in argument, asking no quarter and giving none; in the back row when tact was handed out; impetuous; secretive; inspirational, and utterly dedicated, with a constitution as tough as old boots. She saw herself as the custodian of the government&apos;s covenant, direction, tempo and temper \u2013 its quality controller, as well as leader. To all this, she brought one great quality: like Attlee, she wasn&apos;t much concerned about what the media got up to. This meant that she did not crave to be loved. God save me from politicians who want to be loved. It is sufficient to be respected. Margaret Thatcher was respected. Kenneth Baker   Cabinet member, 1985-92; education secretary, 1986-1989 When a policy matter came before the cabinet, Margaret&apos;s views were usually signalled to the participants in three ways: her private office would let your private office know how she felt; Willie Whitelaw in a rather Delphic way would let it be known that there were some difficulties; or there was her own manner at the meeting. Although you knew how the ground lay, you also knew that Margaret liked a good argument. What she could not stand were ministers or officials who had not done their homework: those she would crush with withering contempt. But if you argued your corner and the grounds were sound, she did reveal a grudging respect. Some of the trickiest meetings I had with Margaret concerned the development of the national curriculum after the 1987 election. She wanted a simple curriculum of English, maths and science, and I wanted a broader one. The issue was debated at a series of meetings before a cabinet committee. The other ministers, apart from speaking to their ministerial briefs, often reminisced from their own experience or that of their children, which was not particularly relevant to the development of a national curriculum for state-sector education. Some of the debates were very bruising. I eventually got virtually all I wanted because the development of it was so complicated that neither Margaret nor her ministers could read a 40-page proposal on the curriculum content for science or history or English. One of the intriguing things with Margaret was to discover where she got her information. She would be provided with a brief from the cabinet office, and being thorough, you could frequently see her underlinings on the last page. Then she had a brief from Brian Griffiths&apos;s team in charge of policy at No 10. It was shorter, but again various parts were underlined. She would use these briefs in the meetings, interlarding them with her own comments. But if the argument was going against her, she would open the famous handbag and draw out a scrappy piece of paper. She would say: &quot;Did you know people are waiting six months for an operation in Portsmouth?&quot; or &quot;Did you know there is a total breakdown of order in schools in Lambeth?&quot; I was never sure where these bits of information came from because she had a network of her own. I discovered that on education, one of her informants was her hairdresser, who lived in south London. He would regale her with graphic stories of the collapse of the education system in his borough as he did her hair in the morning. In dealing with Margaret, you had to cope with the conventional and unconventional approach. It was always challenging and at times great fun. James Baker White House chief of staff, 1981-85; US secretary of treasury, 1985-88; US secretary of state, 1989-92 From their first meeting in 1978, President Reagan recognised Margaret Thatcher as a philosophical soulmate. Both passionately believed the doctrines of democratic liberalism. Both instinctively understood the ruinous consequences of communism, socialism and excessive government regulation. And both spoke with such plain eloquence about these things that they won the trust of their electorates and, with it, the power to transform their nations and \u2013 in time \u2013 the world. When Prime Minister Thatcher took office, the clock had run down on Britain&apos;s post-war experiment in socialism. Inflation reached 25%, state industries lost millions each week, and the top marginal tax rate was 83%. In the US, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates soared, casting the economy into stagflation. Declinism was in the air. Experts said we should stop thinking about growth and start thinking about the limits of growth. But Prime Minister Thatcher and President Reagan shared an optimistic dream of what she later called &quot;boundless opportunity built on enterprise, individual effort and personal generosity.&quot; Beginning in 1979, she attacked the British disease with determination. But when Reagan took his oath 19 months later, her privatisation campaign, tax cuts, and other programmes had not yet borne fruit. At first, Reagan&apos;s tax cuts (from 70% to 50%, later to 28%), deregulation, free trade and sound money also failed to break the grip of recession. But both leaders stood firm. &quot;This lady&apos;s not for turning,&quot; she famously declared. &quot;[P]eople are prepared to put up with sacrifices if they know those sacrifices are the foundations of future prosperity.&quot; In November 1982, the US economy started growing again. Britain regained its proper place among the most vibrant world economies. And elsewhere, the demonstration effect of the Thatcher-Reagan revolution ignited what one commentator called &quot;a startling burst of innovation, economic growth, and political freedom&quot; that has meant opportunity, hope, and better lives for billions of men, women, and children worldwide. Thatcher and Reagan, armed with deep faith in personal freedom, also had the courage to speak truth to the Soviet Union. It was an &quot;evil empire&quot;, Reagan told parliament in 1982, to Thatcher&apos;s happy applause at hearing her own long-held ideas echoed by an American president. (And by the way, it was the Soviets who in the 1970s first called her the &quot;Iron Lady,&quot; and they didn&apos;t mean it as a compliment.) Both leaders also clearly understood what most others did not \u2013 that communism would eventually fail, that it was, as Reagan said, &quot;destined for the ash heap of history&quot;. Yet they were also realists. The nuclear-armed Soviet Union was still dangerous. When others would not, Thatcher allowed new and better US missiles to be stationed on British soil and supported the American president&apos;s rejection of unverifiable treaties. But she also recognized \u2013 earlier than we \u2013 that the west could do business with Gorbachev. Together, they engaged the Soviets in talks that began the process of east-west reconciliation. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, validating the doctrines of peace through strength and cautious engagement. It then fell to the first President Bush to assure that the Soviet Union died with a whimper, not with a bang. He avoided triumphalism, assured Soviet leaders that the west had no military designs, and won their co-operation in the Gulf war and Madrid peace conference. And in this, he had no better ally and friend than Great Britain. The special relationship gave Thatcher license to disagree on German reunification, the role of the United Nations in the Gulf war, and other points. But she never ceased to be our trusted adviser and ally, nor we hers. Domestically and internationally, Thatcher and her American presidential allies simply won the battle of ideas. Today, democracy and free markets are widely honored (though sometimes grudgingly), and outright collectivism rarely defended. Even old political foes and other critics comfortably inhabit the structures that Thatcher and her Yankee friends created. Ideas that once seemed radical are now commonplace. Napoleon called Britain a nation of shopkeepers. It fell to a British shopkeeper&apos;s daughter to demonstrate that what was intended as an insult was, in fact, the clue to Britain&apos;s greatness. The same personal, economic and political freedom that produces a nation of shopkeepers also produces general happiness and prosperity for the shopkeepers&apos; nation. The job of government, Margaret Thatcher well understood, is simply to preserve the security and freedom of all its people, so they can run their own shops and their own lives."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/09/thatcher-football-hillsborough", "sentences": ["As their commercial, match-day and TV income soared, clubs became entities to be traded by offshore trusts or floated on stock markets in Singapore or New York."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-09T14:58:00Z", "title": "Margaret Thatcher era left mark on football but she could have ruined game", "tags": ["Football", "Margaret Thatcher", "Hillsborough disaster", "Sport", "Politics"], "article": "Just as the avalanche of words in this morning&apos;s papers on the myriad legacies of Margaret Thatcher have been predictably wildly polarised, so too is the verdict on her effect on our national game. Colin Moynihan, who defied Thatcher to win a silver medal as a cox at the 1980 Olympics but went on to become her loyal sports minister for the closing years of football&apos;s dark decade of the 1980s, on Tuesday called her &quot;the finest captain of Team GB&quot; and detailed a list of achievements he claimed modernised British sport at a time when she and he combined to &quot;face, tackle and seek to eradicate the scourge of football hooliganism at home and abroad&quot;. In a piece in the Daily Mail Jeff Powell claimed she saved British football by taking a hard line on hooliganism. But those views are very much in the minority. That she had little natural connection with, or affinity for, sport is widely documented. Her 11 years in power were bookended by a failed bid to force British athletes to boycott the Moscow Olympics in 1980 and the 1989 Hillsborough disaster and its immediate aftermath. Even staunch allies, including John Major and David Mellor, have confirmed that she had very little time for sport in general and football in particular. While every prime minister since has paid at least lip service to the power of sport and the pull of football, Thatcher exhibited the opposite. Her pet project, driven by the then Luton Town chairman and backbench Tory MP David Evans, to deal with hooliganism by introducing a membership card scheme for all football fans, with draconian penalties for those who were not in possession of one and overseen by a new body with the power effectively to control their movements, was hated by those it threatened to police. It was eventually, reluctantly dropped only when Lord Justice Taylor&apos;s report in the wake of Hillsborough dismissed it as counter-productive. Two days before Margaret Thatcher&apos;s ceremonial funeral, the families of the 96 men, women and children who died at Hillsborough will gather at Anfield to mark the 24th anniversary of the tragedy. Even in death the former prime minister seems inextricably linked with the tragedy that happened on her watch. It will be the first annual memorial since the Hillsborough Independent Panel report definitively absolved fans of blame, reiterated that the main causes were a loss of control by the emergency services and the unsafe ground and exposed the scale of an establishment cover-up that smeared their name and kept the true causes of the tragedy obscured. It will also be the first since David Cameron stood in the House of Commons and the prime minister issued a blanket apology for the &quot;double injustice&quot; suffered by families of those who perished on the Leppings Lane terrace on the day and in the 23 years since. Thatcher seemed to see football, and those who watched it, as of a piece with other &quot;enemies within&quot; on the picket lines and on the left. She and her ministers often described the game as a &quot;law and order issue&quot;. As the then editor of When Saturday Comes Andy Lyons correctly identified in a piece for this newspaper in 2009: &quot;Two crowd disasters in 1985 became a watershed. A terrace riot had been the immediate cause of the deaths of 39 Italian supporters at Heysel stadium, Brussels on 29 May but several other contributory factors were overlooked in the rush to condemn football fans, including the woefully decrepit state of the stadium and the badly mismanaged distribution of tickets. A month before Heysel a fire in a wooden stand at Bradford City caused 56 deaths.&quot; Her attitude to football, inevitably coloured by the stain of hooliganism on Britain&apos;s international reputation, and the reaction of football fans to her were also bound up in the complex web of social and cultural upheaval that she helped create \u2013 particularly in the sport&apos;s great northern strongholds. Twenty years after she left Downing Street for the last time it was revealed that her ministers had recommended the city of Liverpool be abandoned to &quot;managed decline&quot;. There were times when it appeared Thatcher would be happy if football followed a similar path. In the dense 395 pages of text contained in the devastatingly argued HIP report just one colour photograph is included \u2013 it shows Thatcher and her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, standing grim-faced on the terraces at Hillsborough the day after the disaster. The report contained no &quot;silver bullet&quot; linking Thatcher to a premeditated plot to smear fans. But what emerges is a more complex picture of a prime minister all too ready to believe the line being fed to her by senior officers in a police force that by that stage was considered by many to be almost an arm of government. The report reveals that cabinet papers showed she believed Taylor&apos;s report to be a &quot;devastating criticism&quot; of the police and was briefed that the &quot;defensive \u2013 at times close to deceitful \u2013 behaviour by the senior officers in South Yorkshire sounds depressingly familiar&quot;. And yet she did nothing to alter a fictional narrative that, once set in stone by a media that infamously included the Sun newspaper with which her administration was inextricably linked, remained in place until it was shattered 23 years later by the expert independent panel chaired by the Right Reverend James Jones. Worse, despite the evidence of a series of official reports going all the way back to the serious overcrowding at the &quot;White Horse final&quot; of 1923, the Thatcher administration had done little to address the crumbling, unsafe, unsanitary conditions at football grounds that led directly to the events of 15 April 1989. For her, the &quot;law and order issue&quot; appeared to obscure all else \u2013 including the irony that for her critics a direct line could be drawn between Thatcherism and the new breed of football hooligan, clad in designer clothes and organising fights well away from grounds. It was not Thatcher but Lord Justice Taylor \u2013 appointed to investigate the reasons for the disaster \u2013 who plotted a course to a brighter future for the game. From the sold-out, safe, modern cathedrals of football and the wall-to-wall live coverage of 138 top-flight matches of the season to ever spiralling ticket and subscription prices and the alienation felt by some fans, both sides of the coin were minted in Taylor&apos;s report. For a piece on the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in 2009, the University of Liverpool&apos;s Professor Rogan Taylor said he believed Taylor saved the game from Thatcher. &quot;The game died and was reborn. Some people might not like the new creature that it has become. [But] Taylor wrote a future for the game at a time when the government was seeking to consign it to the same dustbin as the miners and anything else that smelled of the smoke\u2013stack industries and flat-capped working classes.&quot; It was not the Taylor report alone \u2013 and its key recommendation that stadiums become all seated in the top two divisions with the help of public money, thus transforming crumbling unsafe grounds into places where families could comfortably enjoy an afternoon out \u2013 that overhauled football&apos;s image and laid the foundations for the Premier League boom that followed. But it was a key staging post. Others arguably included (in no particular order): Gazza&apos;s tears and triumphant homecoming from Italia 90; All Played Out and Nessun Dorma; When Saturday Comes and fanzine culture; CCTV and improved policing; the sudden middle-class acceptability of the sport for which Nick Hornby&apos;s Fever Pitch became convenient shorthand; and even acid house. Yet away from the bleak images of Heysel and Valley Parade and the twisted metal fences of Hillsborough, it should not be overlooked that Thatcher&apos;s policies also \u2013 almost by accident \u2013 laid the blueprint for today&apos;s Premier League, for good or ill. The media revolution she ushered in by granting a satellite licence to one of her biggest supporters in Rupert Murdoch was a huge factor in stoking the exponential growth in media rights, which for the top flight have grown from \u00a3191m to \u00a35.5bn over the past two decades and, in turn, fuelled the growth in wages that helped attract the world&apos;s best to play here. Look, too, at the architects of the Premier League revolution and the money that fuelled it. They included Alan Sugar, the Essex wheeler dealer who made his fortune selling satellite dishes and helped ensure Sky secured the live TV rights to the nascent Premier League in 1991 with his tip-off to Murdoch&apos;s lieutenant Sam Chisholm that he should &quot;blow them [ITV] out of the water&quot;. Whatever their personal political leanings, men such as the Crystal Palace chairman, Ron Noades, the Spurs owner, Irving Scholar, and Chelsea&apos;s Ken Bates appeared the living embodiment of Thatcherism and its values. For both good and ill the formation of the Premier League was football&apos;s equivalent of her &quot;big bang&quot; deregulation of the financial markets of the mid-1980s, enabling the big clubs to swat away eventually an ineffectual and vain Football Association just as the stuffy City institutions had been swept aside. Those yuppies on their huge phones, driving 911s or dancing badly in their striped shirts and red braces that were plastered liberally over all the documentaries that appeared on every channel on Monday night to music of the era might have been trading shares in Spurs or Manchester United. &quot;Light touch&quot; regulation led to clubs first floating on the stock market in the 1980s, like Thatcher&apos;s privatised utilities, and, amid the Premier League boom that followed, a new era of globalisation as investors and &quot;benefactors&quot; from around the world piled into what was now an international product that penetrated the lives of fans across the globe, seeking either profit or to burnish their reputation. As their commercial, match-day and TV income soared, clubs became entities to be traded by offshore trusts or floated on stock markets in Singapore or New York. In the week that the protracted Portsmouth saga will finally reach a definitive conclusion in the high court, it is worth remembering that Lord Justice Taylor also presciently wrote: &quot;Boardroom struggles for power, wheeler-dealing in the buying and selling of shares, and indeed of whole clubs, sometimes suggest that those involved are more interested in the personal financial benefits or social status of being a director than of directing the club in the interests of its supporter customers.&quot; As extensively chronicled by my colleague David Conn, it was part of a process that changed football forever in this country. Just as some commentators have argued in the past 24 hours that Germany&apos;s path suggested Thatcher&apos;s necessary shock treatment for the economy could perhaps have been achieved with less brutal impact on the social fabric of the country, so Conn and others have questioned whether the Bundesliga might have offered a different path for top-flight football. As it is, just as Jonathan Freedland persuasively argued in Tuesday&apos;s Guardian that we still live in &quot;the land Maggie built&quot;, so too our modern game was hewn during her administration \u2013 despite the fact she at times appeared personally bent on its ruination. And just as New Labour refined Thatcherism&apos;s broad thrust while holding true to its central creeds, so the Premier League&apos;s message has become more sophisticated over time without losing its free market thrust. It is an inevitably crude exercise and the Premier League&apos;s architects would point out that it is more redistributive than the top flights in Italy or Spain, but in all sorts of ways today&apos;s Premier League \u2013 with its ruthless divisions between rich and poor, winners and losers, its reward of sometimes reckless risk taking, its clear focus on maximising revenue \u2013 remains a child of Thatcher&apos;s Britain."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/10/masters-matteo-manassero", "sentences": ["I have three courses out there that I go and play on; I was there once already then went out and won the week after at the Singapore Open so it shows how useful it is to me."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-10T22:31:00Z", "title": "Masters 2013: Matteo Manassero ready to fulfil his youthful promise", "tags": ["The Masters", "Golf", "Masters 2013", "Sport", "Guan Tianlang"], "article": "Matteo Manassero could once lay claim to a Masters record; that of being its youngest ever competitor. The Italian was 16 years and 11 months old in 2009; he even made the Augusta cut as an amateur for good measure. Manassero now laughs when discussing the achievements of Guan Tianlang, who at 14 has now usurped at least part of his achievement of four years ago. &quot;People say Guan has broken my record; he is destroying it,&quot; Manassero admits. &quot;It will be a great experience for him, as it was for me. I would urge him to experience everything that he can at Augusta; he will no doubt return there as a professional, when he needs to compete and be more serious about it, in a way. &quot;So this year he should just see everything he can and enjoy every minute. He doesn&apos;t need to think too much about performing brilliantly. That will all come later in his career.&quot; Fittingly, Manassero and Tianlang are playing partners for the opening two rounds of the 77th Masters. That advice, then, can be imparted in person. Manassero is a case in point of how a promising career start can be steadily developed. He returns to the Masters this week for the first time since that 2009 appearance, and as a three-time winner on the European Tour. He is the only teenager in history to reach such a milestone. &quot;I have been very comfortable,&quot; explains Manassero of his switch into the professional ranks. &quot;The people around me helped a lot, I could make that move without pressure, really. I felt comfortable as soon as I was out on tour. &quot;Being at Augusta as an amateur player is still very fresh in my mind, though. I have so many memories and so many good memories. Being back, for the first time as a professional, is very special.&quot; Manassero believes he is winning what battle golfers have for attention in Italy. There, football is the overwhelming and dominant national sport. Or, on occasion, national obsession. &quot;I think I have been recognised for what I have done over the past three years,&quot; he adds. &quot;I couldn&apos;t ask for more, in that sense. &quot;Golf is growing in Italy. There is a lot of interest, a lot more viewers when it is on television. It feels like an honour that something myself and the other Italian players have done might have played a part in that.&quot; Yet it is in another nation, Abu Dhabi, that Manassero spends much of his preparation time. His latest trip came in advance of the return to Georgia. &quot;Abu Dhabi has been very important for me,&quot; Manassero says. &quot;Especially towards the end of the year, when the weather is too cold at home to practice. I have three courses out there that I go and play on; I was there once already then went out and won the week after at the Singapore Open so it shows how useful it is to me. &quot;I have perfect weather there towards the end of the year and the start of the year, plus great facilities, so these are things I try to make the most of.&quot; With specific regard to the season&apos;s first major, Manassero is in confident mood. And with good reason; changes made to his game have afforded him greater distance from the tee than ever before. &quot;I am as comfortable as I can be at Augusta,&quot; he says. &quot;I am hitting the ball further and that could help me here; the ball is going higher, and longer. &quot;I have lost weight and done a lot of gym work, putting muscle in just so that I become more of an athlete.

Anyone who describes herself as a world citizen, and who was named &quot;woman of the year&quot; at the Global Leadership and Global Diversity awards, and who has had a distinguished career in global economic development, is clearly well-placed to think about the way global governments work together on complex, long-term issues. Shafik will present the lecture to an invited audience in Washington on Wednesday 17 April. Egyptian-born Shafik, who is also a British and US national, was appointed to her present role as one of three deputy managing directors at the IMF, in February 2011, in what turned into a tumultuous year for the organisation, following the scandal that engulfed its former head, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned in May 2011 and the appointment of former French finance minister Christine Lagarde as the first female head of the IMF. Shafik joined the IMF after several years in the UK senior civil service, most recently as permanent secretary \u2013 the most senior civil servant \u2013 at the department for international development. Before that, Shafik had been the youngest vice-president of the World Bank and had also been part of the senior management team of the International Finance Corp. Shafik&apos;s early life and education were in Egypt, but she also has degrees from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst and the London School of Economics and a PhD in economics from Oxford University. She is a member of the IMF&apos;s Middle East advisory group. Shafik, who is often known by her nickname Minouche, has a keen interest in the impact of government decisions on the poorest members of society. She will be the third speaker in the Guardian&apos;s Global Public Leaders series, following the launch of the series in Singapore by Peter Ong, the head of the Singapore civil service, and the lecture in London earlier in 2013 by academic and writer Karin Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall. The series is supported by our partner, Ernst &amp; Young. Ong&apos;s lecture touched on many of the digital issues that affect the design and delivery of moder public services, while Svanborg-Sj\u00f6vall considered the topic of welfare reform and the lessons that other governments might learn from the unique way this has been tackled in Sweden. Shafik will take these themes further to consider the way governments must work together \u2013 and with their citizens \u2013 if they are to tackle the most deep-rooted social issues and ensure those who most need them have access to education and health. Shafik recently told the UK Nuffield Trust health policy summit that it was &quot;critical&quot; for health reforms to contain spending pressures and that healthcare reforms would be the most decisive for the economies of the world. \u2022 Want your say?

Large numbers of children have not had the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, largely because of the scare that followed the publication of research by Andrew Wakefield in the Lancet medical journal in 1998 that postulated a link between the jab and autism. The research was later discredited and Wakefield was struck off by the General Medical Council for fraud. In Wollaston&apos;s constituency of Totnes, Devon, the concern generated by Wakefield lingers on and is part of the reason, she believes, for a general distrust of vaccines and a reliance on homeopathy \u2013 remedies that are almost entirely water. About 70% of five-year-olds in Totnes were fully protected against measles last year, she said on her blog, compared with 94% of those in Brixham, just miles away. &quot;Some parents have an unshakeable belief that homeopathy boosts their child&apos;s immune system. They would rather put their faith in &apos;natural&apos; methods, as they see it,&quot; she told the Guardian. That belief can spread in communities and outside school gates, and those who accept the NHS advice to give their child the MMR vaccine start to feel pressured. &quot;Once it reaches a critical mass within a community, it takes on its own significance \u2013 you become an irresponsible parent if you are vaccinating,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it is time to dump this term &apos;herd immunity&apos;. The message, as I see it, is about community immunity. By vaccinating your child, you protect the child who cannot be vaccinated as they are too young or sickly.&quot; Wollaston called on the governing bodies of homeopathy to tell parents that homeopathic &quot;vaccines&quot; and remedies would not protect against measles. The British Homeopathic Association and Faculty of Homeopathy said they would do so. &quot;There is no evidence to suggest homeopathic vaccinations can protect against contagious diseases. We recommend people seek out the conventional treatments,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;I don&apos;t know where the parents in Totnes are getting their information from \u2013 it certainly is not us. There is no legal regulation of homeopathy in the UK and anyone can set themselves up as an expert. It is those people who tend to give us a bad name.&quot; Philip Edmonds, chairman of the Society of Homeopaths said: &quot;The Society does not endorse the use of homeopathic medicines as an alternative to vaccination for the prevention of serious infectious diseases and recommends that members of the public seek the advice of their GP, and/or relevant Department of Health guidelines, concerning vaccination and protection against disease.&quot; There are currently about 700 cases and suspected cases of measles in Wales, the biggest outbreak since the triple jab was launched in 1988. An estimated 40,000 children in Wales have not had the MMR, and special catch-up NHS clinics have been held for two weekends in a row in the worst-affected Swansea area. Some parents continue to seek out single vaccines, against NHS advice. The Children&apos;s Immunisation Centre, which runs six clinics in England and one in Swansea, said it was being inundated with calls from parents seeking a measles vaccine. &quot;The clinics are very, very busy,&quot; said manager Zoe Miller. &quot;It has made people realise, crikey, we have not vaccinated our\u00a0children. They need to do it before it spreads to their children.&quot; Miller said staff advised parents to give their children all three vaccines at intervals, but the chain of private clinics has no mumps vaccine and has not had any for three years. Outbreaks of mumps, sometimes known as the kissing disease, can occur among students starting university. Although serious complications are rare, they can include viral meningitis and swelling of the testicles or ovaries. &quot;Mumps isn&apos;t life-threatening,&quot; said Miller. The vaccine, she added &quot;is apparently available in Singapore&quot;. The clinics say they are attempting to source a Jeryl Lynn strain of mumps vaccine to import, which they say is the safest strain. However, the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority, which licences vaccines in the UK, disagrees. &quot;The MHRA is not currently aware of any available single-component mumps vaccines for which there are no safety concerns,&quot; it said in a statement. &quot;In relation to the Children&apos;s Immunisation clinics, we have significant concerns over the quality of the mumps vaccine the clinic is attempting to supply.&quot; The Department of Health&apos;s position is that there is no evidence to support the use of single vaccines or to suggest they are in any way safer than the MMR, which is supported by the World Health Organisation and other independent expert groups around the world.

But he has overlooked design and technology, which has the potential to be a truly creative, intensive, problem-solving subject, and the only exposure children have to engineering. Instead, he is diluting it with puff pastry and topiary. Cookery and horticulture will not fix Britain&apos;s export future, but technology can. Gove is sending the wrong message. Dyson needs 500 engineers as we expand our research laboratories, and Britain needs a whopping 65,000 more to meet demand. The government talks about Stem \u2013 science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 but totally ignores the e. Maybe it&apos;s just there to make yet another snappy acronym. But, if we are not careful, Britain will end up with no technology and engineering companies, as they head off to where the engineers are \u2013 Malaysia and Singapore. Britain&apos;s trade balance will go even further into the red. We need to persuade more children that engineering is exciting; that it is up to engineers to solve the world&apos;s great problems. From drought, global warming and over-fishing, to those everyday bugbears in our homes. Mending bikes and boiling eggs won&apos;t inspire the brightest young minds \u2013 at our peril. So my foundation is doing something about it. This week we&apos;ll launch the Ideas Box. It&apos;s a free resource developed by engineers and primary school teachers. It challenges children to become design engineers. They redesign something in their classroom \u2013 a whiteboard, a fire alarm, whatever product frustrates them. They prototype, test and learn. Mistakes are encouraged! This is what we believe the curriculum should be about \u2013 problem-solving, prototyping and learning by doing. All children are inquisitive and their every utterance is a question. DT allows children to look at the world around them and find problems they can solve. They apply their maths, science and technological knowledge throughout the whole process. Iterative design \u2013 it&apos;s what real engineers do every day. And it&apos;s much more exciting than 30 students making the same wooden key holder. DT should be the fourth science. It is no coincidence that students who study DT alongside maths and science do better; taught well, it contextualises tricky equations and abstract scientific concepts in creative ways. Much better to actually build a model cantilever bridge to understand the forces at work than to learn from a textbook. This is why 75% of Dyson engineers studied DT \u2013 they wax lyrical about the subject&apos;s potential, and rightly so. There is still time to encourage the next generation of British engineers. The curriculum review public consultation closes today, and, like an engineering project, it is sure to be an iterative design process. Michael Gove must make sure he exercises the perseverance that engineers require and keeps working on the DT syllabus until it is fit for purpose, inspiring thousands of future problem solvers; future engineers. \u2022 Sir James Dyson is an inventor and founder of Dyson, the technology company"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/apr/16/technology-links-newsbucket", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s NFC sign-ups are &quot;slow&quot; - report &gt;&gt; Mobile World Live  The rate at which mobile subscribers are signing up for NFC-based services in Singapore is &quot;slow&quot;, according to a report in the Straits Times.", "Singapore has adopted a model whereby the country&apos;s three mobile operators \u2013 SingTel, M1 and Starhub \u2013 have built a shared NFC infrastructure with partners in a government-backed approach.Although the underlying infrastructure is shared, the operators offer competitive retail services which they launched last summer."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-16T05:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Microsoft iWatch?, Google v Bing, Samsung dirty tricks with HTC?, and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Microsoft smart watch would be &apos;snipe hunt&apos; distraction from Windows 8 &gt;&gt; Computerworld  Microsoft is reportedly working on designs for a touch-enabled smart watch, a move one analyst called a &quot;snipe hunt&quot; that would distract it from the critical chore of getting Windows 8 off the ground.

The changing web platform landscape: more fragmentation? &gt;&gt; Adobe Digital Media Blog  In this new web platform landscape, what about Adobe&apos;s contributions to open source browsers? What impact does additional browser fragmentation has on Adobe&apos;s efforts? Adobe contributes to standards in open browser implementations for many reasons. One of them is that our new generation Edge tools use a &apos;web design surface&apos;. For well over a year now, we have chosen to use the Chromium Embeded Framework (CEF) to provide this &apos;web design surface&apos;. So naturally, we will contribute to Blink since it is now the core engine that powers CEF. Another reason for contributing to open browsers is to accelerate the availability of new features on the web. This is why we collaborate with Mozilla on a number of standards and contribute code to Gecko (like this patch on masking for canvas). And this is why we will also contribute to WebKit, in addition to Blink, now that the two are separate projects.  Singapore&apos;s NFC sign-ups are &quot;slow&quot; - report &gt;&gt; Mobile World Live  The rate at which mobile subscribers are signing up for NFC-based services in Singapore is &quot;slow&quot;, according to a report in the Straits Times. Since last August about 15,000 users have upgraded to NFC-based SIM cards that enable mobile payments, sources told the publication. Singapore has adopted a model whereby the country&apos;s three mobile operators \u2013 SingTel, M1 and Starhub \u2013 have built a shared NFC infrastructure with partners in a government-backed approach.Although the underlying infrastructure is shared, the operators offer competitive retail services which they launched last summer. Of the 15,000 figure, around half paid to upgrade their SIM cards to NFC, while the rest were given the cards as part of promotions.

Taiwan probes Samsung &apos;dirty tricks&apos; vs HTC&apos; &gt;&gt; AFP  Taiwanese authorities said Monday they had launched an investigation into allegations that South Korean tech giant Samsung hired students to post malicious comments about local rival HTC online. &quot;The case was set up last week after we received complaints,&quot; Fair Trade Commission spokesman Sun Lih-chyun told AFP. He said the probe would look into allegations that Samsung engaged in false advertising and that if the allegations were upheld, Samsung and its local advertising agent could face a fine of up to Tw$25 million ($835,000). Complaints emerged this month, with internet users alleging that Samsung, through its local agent, had hired students to write online articles attacking HTC and recommending Samsung cellphones, the United Evening News said\u2026 in a statement on its Facebook page, www.facebook.com/SamsungTaiwan, Samsung Taiwan said it regretted &quot;any inconvenience and confusion from the Internet event&quot;. &quot;Samsung Taiwan has halted all internet marketing such as posting articles on websites,&quot; it said. Samsung was fined Tw$300,000 by the commission earlier this year for a misleading advertisement about the camera functions on Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Y Duos GT-S6102, according to Taiwan&apos;s state Central News Agency.  Gosh. iPhone 6 &gt;&gt; Marco.org Marco Arment, Instapaper developer, on naming:   A year later, when Apple did release a model named &quot;iPhone 5&quot; that was far better than the 4S and had an external redesign, the inertia of Apple pessimism was so strong and the press had become such petulant children about Apple products that they shat all over it even though it was a huge update that gave them everything they asked for, plus more. Now, Apple pessimism is even stronger. No matter what they release and no matter how well it sells, they won&apos;t win over the press, the pundits, the stock market, or the rhetoric. Not this year. They could release a revolutionary 60-inch 4K TV for $99 with built-in nanobots to assemble and dispense free smartwatches, and people would complain that it should cost $49 and the nanobots aren&apos;t open enough.  You built what?!: A tractor for the apocalypse &gt;&gt; Popular Science  Seeking a fresh start, [Marcin] Jakubowski bought 30 acres of Missouri farmland and a tractor. Life in relative seclusion proved uneventful until, one day in 2008, his tractor broke down for the second and last time, spurring him to start an open-source industrial revolution. To Jakubowski, the tractor seemed designed to fail. Why should he sink more money into fixing it or buy a replacement? He wanted a simple and useful machine, and one he could repair and upgrade on the fly. &quot;It boiled down to lower cost in the long run,&quot; he says. Jakubowski built the first LifeTrac, as he calls his DIY tractor, in three months for $6,000\u2014about $30,000 less than a comparable mass-produced model. Seeing room for improvement, he built a second prototype in just six days. He posted his progress on the tractor and other machines to an online wiki, which attracted followers, who suggested their own design tweaks. Some even visited in person to help with builds \u2014 and Open Source Ecology took off.  (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.) Code Hard or Go Home &gt;&gt; Hypercritical  Some people wonder how Google can possibly have any power in the Android ecosystem if the source code is free. Facebook Home has been cited as an example of Google&apos;s ineffectualness. Look at how one of Google&apos;s fiercest enemies has played it for a fool, they say. Google did all the hard work, then Facebook came in at the last minute and co-opted it all for its own purposes. But look again at the graphs above. Now imagine similar graphs for the Android source code. Any company with Android-based products that wants to be truly free from Google&apos;s control has to be prepared\u2014and able\u2014to match Google&apos;s output. Operating systems don&apos;t write themselves; platforms don&apos;t maintain themselves; developers need tools and support; technology marches on. It&apos;s not enough just to just fix bugs and support new hardware. To succeed with an Android fork, a company has to drive development in the same way that Apple did when it spawned WebKit from KHTML, just as Google is doing as it forks Blink from WebKit.

It will be a concern to every nation,&quot; Grimsson said in an interview. &quot;There is no country that will escape the consequences, either through rising sea levels or extreme weather patterns.&quot; With that in mind, Grimsson argued that oil companies and countries as far away as China, India, Singapore and South Korea should have a voice in the future of the region. At present, only the eight countries of the Arctic Council have a say in setting policy in the region. &quot;We realise that there are other nations in Asia and Europe that have legitimate concerns and enterprises in the Arctic and it&apos;s important to involve them in a co-operative effort,&quot; Grimsson said. He made his visit to Washington as Chinese and Icelandic leaders signed a free trade agreement in Beijing that will give China a bigger foothold in the emerging region. Grimsson said Arctic Circle would aim for a more inclusive debate about the future of the Arctic. Decisions on the development and the environment of the region are now the preserve of the eight countries involved in the Arctic Council: America, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Russia and Sweden in addition to Iceland. But Grimsson said it was important to involve other countries in deciding the future of the region, as it undergoes a rapid transformation due to climate change. Last year produced a record melting of summer sea ice. A  study published last week by scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Arctic waters could be nearly ice-free by as early as 2020. The retreat of summer sea ice has seen a push by oil and mining companies to drill in Arctic waters, and by Asian countries hoping to cut shipping routes. Environment campaigners on Monday planted a flag on the seabed at the north pole and demanded the region be declared a global sanctuary. The new forum launched this week will hold its first gathering in Reykjavik in October and will be open to government officials, scientists and members of non-government organisations. Grimsson described it as an &quot;open tent&quot;. &quot;I see it as a part of my responsibility to encourage a dialogue between the people who live in the Arctic and those who want to use the Arctic \u2013 to put it bluntly,&quot; he said during a speech on Monday. Grimsson told an audience at the National Press Club that in every meeting with Asian leaders this year, from China, South Korea, Singapore and India, his counterparts had sought observer status on the Arctic Council. China, South Korea, and Singapore are exploring new shipping routes across the pole. The polar route would cut about two weeks off the average shipment time between northern Europe and Asia. China has sought permanent observer status in the Arctic Council, the group of eight northern countries that sets policy in the region. Grimsson indicated support for the move, saying outside influence over the Arctic was inevitable. &quot;With the accelerating melting of the Arctic Sea ice we will have an open ocean there that anyone with a vessel could get into according to international law,&quot; he said. China sent an ice breaker through the Arctic last year, and was already building Arctic-capable ships, he noted. &quot;The big question is whether we will catch up with our decision making and our dialogue and our form of co-operation before acceleration of melting sea ice created a completely new playing field.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/16/thai-horror-film-pee-mak", "sentences": ["Pee Mak could be too geared to Thai palates to travel all the way around the globe, but judging by a tight south-east Asian release schedule (Indonesia, 5 April; Hong Kong, 16 May; Cambodia, 23 May; Malaysia, 6 June; Singapore, 13 June; Taiwan, 6 August), it fancies its chance in the neighbourhood."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-16T14:50:06Z", "title": "Thai horror film-makers sink teeth into south-east Asian market", "tags": ["Horror", "Comedy", "Film industry", "Film", "Culture", "Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "The flood of Chinese domestic blockbusters since the turn of the year is the strongest hint yet that the country is capable of being a Hollywood for Asia, and setting the cinema agenda for the region. But it&apos;s not the sole player around. At the end of March Thai audiences flocked to see horror comedy Pee Mak Phrakanong \u2013 based on the Mae Nak folktale about a man who returns from war and unwittingly settles back in with the ghost of his wife, who has died in childbirth. It had the second biggest opening (21.2m baht/\u00a3478,000) ever for a Thai film, and with over 300m baht to date, it is closing on the all-time box-office record (550m baht) held by 2001&apos;s war epic The Legend of Suriyothai. Thai audiences seem to love their history: their domestic all-time top 10 is dominated by it, including Suriyothai, the King Naresuan series \u2013 about to get its fifth instalment \u2013 and the 1999 version of the Mae Nak legend (set in the late 18th/early 19th centuries). But it&apos;s an irreverent take on tradition that has pulled people in for this one. Pee Mak Phrakanong, directed by Banjong Pisanthanakun (also responsible for 2004 global horror hit Shutter), has been transformed from a lovelorn, nostalgic fable to a slick comedy that affectionately teases source material deeply embedded in the Thai collective consciousness. There have been about 30 film adaptations of the story \u2013 including animation, porn and, last year, a 3D version. As well as making the most of photogenic soap stars Mario Maurer and Davika Horne, Pisanthanakun&apos;s version adds copious pop-culture references \u2013 to the likes of The Last Samurai and David Blaine \u2013 and 21st-century snark, making fun of ineffectual monks. It&apos;s that injection of attitude that sets Pee Mak Phrakanong on a nimble contemporary tangent to the country&apos;s history-obsessed box office: it&apos;s easily outpaced second world war love story Khu Kam, another national favourite that has seen multiple adaptations, which was released at the same time. &quot;The reason Pee Mak makes crazy money is because it&apos;s loose and funny,&quot; writes the Bangkok Post&apos;s Kong Rithdee, &quot;and perhaps because it triggers this cool, shallow belief in the star-crossed lovers overcoming the odds set by ideology and death.&quot; The film also seems to be a leap in quality for an industry that has struggled commercially over the last few years and only has a global presence thanks to its arthouse branch, led by Apitchatpong Weerasethakul and Pen-Ek Ratanaruang. &quot;The real good news is that Pee Mak is actually pretty good,&quot; writes Wise Kwai, for Thai newspaper the Nation, &quot;Distinguishing itself from most other Thai horror comedies, this one follows an actual script, which is smartly co-written by the director.&quot; Thailand could make horror comedy \u2013 compared to the more baleful Japanese spookers, or the bloodier Korean variants \u2013 its speciality: Kao Krian, about ghosts scuppering a property developer, and Countdown, by Pee Mak&apos;s youth-focused studio GTH, are just two of the recent films. And it&apos;s a good time to export horror comedy, with a steady flow of it \u2013 especially from the zombie contingent \u2013 having carved out a significant market for it in the last decade. Pee Mak could be too geared to Thai palates to travel all the way around the globe, but judging by a tight south-east Asian release schedule (Indonesia, 5 April; Hong Kong, 16 May; Cambodia, 23 May; Malaysia, 6 June; Singapore, 13 June; Taiwan, 6 August), it fancies its chance in the neighbourhood. So it should: it draws on the vein of wronged-woman folklore that recurs throughout Asia (Ringu drew similarly on Japan&apos;s Yotsuya Kaidan story), and there seems to be a strong appetite for horror in that part of the world. Indonesia is a prolific producer of films with the same fetid perfume of tropical morbidity that underlines the Pee Mak legend; Malaysia has been banging horror films out since a three-decade ban on the genre, for being contrary to Islam, was lifted in 2003. If Pee Mak can secure a release in the massive Chinese market, and stake a claim for the Thai industry, that would be fine news for film diversity in the eastern hemisphere. \u2022 Next week&apos;s After Hollywood will ask whether it&apos;s crunch-time at the Chinese box office for Hollywood.

The reforms could allow state schools to choose to stay open until 4.30pm and introduce a shorter, four-week summer holiday for pupils from September next year, representing a profound change for parents used to tailoring their working hours to the classroom timetable. Gove said the school system had been designed for a 19th-century agricultural economy and risked leaving British children trailing those in Asia. &quot;It may be the case that there are one or two legislative and bureaucratic obstacles which prevent all schools moving in this direction, but I think it&apos;s consistent with the pressures of a modern society. I also think it&apos;s going to be family friendly,&quot; he said. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said Gove was &quot;making policy up on the hoof,&quot; without regard for the evidence. &quot;Teachers and pupils already spend longer hours in the classroom than most countries and also have some of the shortest summer holidays,&quot; she said. &quot;Independent schools in England and Wales, which often break for two weeks more during the summer and have longer holidays at other times of the year than their state counterparts, do not apparently feel the need to change and are apparently not suffering from their reduced hours.&quot; The changes would require a rewriting of teachers&apos; contracts, which Gove kickstarted this week by asking the independent School Teachers&apos; Review Body to examine working hours. The current contract mandates that teachers work 195 days or 1,265 hours a year. Gove told a conference in London, organised by the Spectator magazine, that pupils were being handicapped in comparison with their peers in other countries. &quot;The structure of the school term and the school day was designed at a time when we had an agricultural economy,&quot; he said. &quot;I remember half-term in October when I was at school in Aberdeen was called the tattie holiday \u2013 the period when kids would go to the fields to pick potatoes. It was also at a time when the majority of mums stayed home. That world no longer exists and we can&apos;t afford to have an education system that was essentially set in the 19th century.&quot; Gove gave the example of successful education systems in east Asia that demanded higher standards of their students and had longer school days and shorter holidays. &quot;We&apos;ve noticed in Hong Kong and Singapore and other East Asian nations that expectations of mathematical knowledge or of scientific knowledge at every stage are more demanding than in this country,&quot; Gove said. &quot;In order to reach those levels of achievement a higher level of effort is expected on behalf of students, parents and teachers. School days are longer, school holidays are shorter. The expectation is that to succeed, hard work is at the heart of everything.&quot; &quot;If you look at the length of the school day in England, the length of the summer holiday \u2026 then we are fighting or actually running in this global race in a way that ensures that we start with a significant handicap.&quot; Commenting on the speech, a Whitehall source said: &quot;We can either start working as hard as the Chinese, or we&apos;ll all soon be working for the Chinese.&quot; Under the current system, the school year is 190 days long. Pupils get around six weeks off in summer, two weeks at Christmas and Easter as well as three half-term breaks lasting a week each. School days usually run from around 9am to 3pm, or 3.30pm. Some academies and free schools \u2013 which have more freedom to vary their operating hours \u2013 already keep their pupils in school for longer than state schools. The Ark chain of academies, for example, has mandatory school hours of 8.30am-4.30pm on four days a week and holds remedial classes on Saturdays for pupils lagging in maths and English. Other schools have varied the structure of the school year, such as the David Young Community Academy in Leeds, which has a seven-term year. Asked if there was going to be a teachers&apos; strike, Gove said: &quot;Yes. There seems to be a competition between the NUT and NASUWT to compete for members, with each one trying to out-radical the other.&quot; Gove made an offer to unions who complain about his reforms: &quot;Many of [the teaching unions] have very passionate criticisms of the model of education that I&apos;ve outlined and there&apos;s an open invitation to the unions which is: prove me wrong, set up a free school. &quot;If the NUT were to set up a free school, we would find them a building, we would fund it. And I would love to see an NUT or another union free school.&quot; Turning down Gove&apos;s offer, a union spokesperson said: &quot;The NUT is in a lot of places already. They&apos;re called schools.&quot; At their Easter conference this year the NUT called for new limits on working hours amid concerns that school staff are facing &quot;totally unsustainable&quot; workloads. Delegates backed a plan by the NUT&apos;s executive to draw up a draft contract setting out a 35-hour working week. This would include 20 hours of &quot;pupil contact time&quot; - the equivalent to four hours a day in the classroom - as well as 10 hours for lesson planning, preparation and assessment, and five hours for &quot;non-contact duties&quot; such as staff meetings, parents&apos; evenings and logging pupils&apos; results.

The scheme, also known as a Tobin tax, would put a levy on all euro transactions anywhere in the world. But hopes for it suffered a setback when George Osborne said in Washington that the UK was taking the case to the European court of justice (ECJ). &quot;I am not against financial transaction taxes in principle,&quot; the chancellor said, noting that the UK put stamp duty on shares. &quot;But I am concerned about the extra-territorial aspects of the European commission&apos;s proposals.&quot; Earlier this year 11 countries \u2013 Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Greece, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia and Estonia \u2013 said they had formed a &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; that would allow them to forge ahead with the new tax despite the misgivings of other member states. Despite opting out of the scheme, Britain and other non-participating members had until Thursday to launch a legal challenge to the specific proposals for the levy drafted in Brussels. Osborne confirmed this had been done, but said Britain&apos;s concerns were shared by a number of other countries including the US. The chancellor has also expressed his concerns to the German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble. Britain&apos;s objections concern the scope of the tax. Treasury sources said under the current plans it would be levied on a trade in a euro-denominated financial instrument conducted in Singapore by two American banks, for instance. The City has also sought clarification on how the levy would affect euro trades completed in London between banks from countries not in the scheme, and from UK subsidiaries of banks in participating countries. Osborne believes the tax will damage an already weak eurozone economy and be costly for savers and pensioners because the costs will be passed on. It is thought the ECJ will take up to two years to consider the UK&apos;s case, but the Treasury believes the legislative process to put the tax into force will take longer. Britain believes its objections can be met while the legislation is being passed and sees the court case as an insurance policy. Supporters of the financial transaction tax criticised Osborne&apos;s decision. Owen Tudor, spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, said: &quot;This isn&apos;t about defending British interests against Europe \u2013 it&apos;s about defending one rather rich square mile against the wishes of people in Britain and across Europe. &quot;Not content with letting our banks off scot-free, Osborne now wants to prevent European countries from making their financial sectors pay to repair the damage caused by the crisis. &quot;Resorting to lawyers is the last refuge of a chancellor who has lost the argument. &quot;Not only is this morally wrong, it is breathtakingly hypocritical \u2013 the UK&apos;s own \u00a33bn stamp duty on shares is collected wherever UK shares are traded and regardless of who is trading them.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/apr/19/prince-harry-posh-people-obsessed-conquering", "sentences": ["They were the only people who looked remotely sane in that street crowd, and they were the only people outside the hotel, apart from a children&apos;s author from Singapore who claimed that, when he put his books in people&apos;s hands, they instantly fell pregnant (it worked on Kate."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-19T19:42:01Z", "title": "Why Prince Harry and posh people are obsessed with conquering things | Saturday sketch", "tags": ["Prince Harry", "UK news", "World news", "Antarctica", "Disability", "Society"], "article": "Taller in real life, no less ginger: that is the immediate news about Prince Harry, if you must know.

He gives good patriotic passion, and is always ready with a laugh. &quot;But there&apos;s something else, something deeper \u2026 A toughness of mind. An unquench-ion-able [this word was a cross between unquestionable and unmentionable] mind that leads someone to say &apos;I will not be beaten&apos;.&quot; It is a rum old game, martial self-fashioning. They must do this at Sandhurst, a course on how irony and realism are for pussies, and nobody ever built an empire saying, &quot;but the South Pole is incredibly cold and inhospitable&quot;. &quot;Teams of our wounded will manhaul sledges on skis&quot;, explained Ed Parker, co-founder of Walking with the Wounded. It&apos;s &quot;to show the world the extraordinary courage and determination of the men and women who have been wounded while serving our countries and to remind us all of the help and support we owe them&quot;. I get all that. It is good to be reminded of the hardship they endure on our (sort of) behalf, even if putting them through another, fresh hardship is a curious way to go about it. I am not one of those people who think that, because you disagree with a war, you don&apos;t care that people lose their limbs fighting it. I accept, even while I admit I do not fully understand, that posh people are obsessed with the Earth&apos;s poles. That&apos;s why Eton&apos;s school trips are to the Arctic rather than (or maybe as well as) to Chamonix. That&apos;s why expeditions, throughout history, which looked like suicide missions inspire such great, such craven respect from the aristocratic class, while the rest of us think, yes, it was brave, but \u2013 like sticking your hand in a toaster \u2013 if you&apos;d thought about it beforehand, you would have seen that it was a foolish idea. What I don&apos;t understand is the link between the language of challenge \u2013 or, to give it its full title, as Major Kate Philp did, &quot;guts, determination, teamwork, physical and mental courage&quot; \u2013 and the exquisite, almost courtly love of authority that seems to accompany it. &quot;Sir,&quot; Parker said to Harry, only by a mighty effort of will (plus guts, determination, etc) leaving an &quot;e&quot; off the end, &quot;your support and commitment is what really makes a difference. I know you, like these men and women, are a soldier.&quot; It is as if courage itself, rather than being a necessary asset in the toolkit of war, is war&apos;s main purpose; as if the entire point of raising an army, sticking a prince at the top of it, and advancing into a dangerous world, were just to make the point that you have an unquenchable mind that will not be beaten. It&apos;s a bit like reading Beowulf \u2013 why does he have to do all this nutty fighting? Why does he always have to be the guy at the front, who wins? For posterity, stupid. Beowulf, of course, had the get-out of living in the eighth century, and also being fictional. Fourteen centuries later, it sort of surprises me that there are still people, even people who have had rather sheltered lives, with the same warrior mythmaking, who haven&apos;t realised that posterity has its own battles to worry about. Outside the hotel beforehand, three American students, Claire Deneen, Alison Pohle, and Jessica Puckett, all 21, were waiting for a glimpse of the prince. They looked faintly familiar, and I realised that I&apos;ve bloody interviewed them before, when Kate Middleton went to visit Hope House. They were the only people who looked remotely sane in that street crowd, and they were the only people outside the hotel, apart from a children&apos;s author from Singapore who claimed that, when he put his books in people&apos;s hands, they instantly fell pregnant (it worked on Kate. And it also worked on Celine Dion). It struck me for a moment that this was all that was keeping the royal mystique alive, these three, very well-organised American students. But that was before I saw the royal mystique in action. Prince Harry doesn&apos;t need students. Nobody who goes to the South Pole needs a crowd outside to ask for their autograph. They have toughness of mind; it doesn&apos;t mean much to those of us without it, but it means a lot to them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/19/longer-hours-wont-help-students", "sentences": ["We can only presume that Gove&apos;s thorough research has recognised but discounted the positive models of European education we could learn from.Hannah Murray and Samuel MilesExeter \u2022 One of the chief reasons students in Singapore and Hong Kong outperform western pupils is not a longer school day or shorter holidays, but private tutoring."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-19T20:00:22Z", "title": "Letters: Longer hours will not help pupils", "tags": ["Education", "Michael Gove", "Politics"], "article": "   Illustration by Gillian Blease    So Michael Gove intends to continue on his destructive path of evidence-free reform of our education system by extending the school day and cutting holidays (Report, 19 April)? All the evidence shows that increasing the hours pupils spend in school does nothing to improve educational outcomes across the board. As others in the media have already pointed out, Finland has some of the lowest hours of contact time and some of the best results in international tables. What matters most when it comes to quality of education is the quality of the teaching. Having just retired from teaching after 38 years, I can testify to just how exhausting it is to work 55-60 hours a week, in a highly pressured environment, with little time for reflection on practice or acquisition of new skills and knowledge. The school holidays are used by teachers for those activities, a chance to catch up on paperwork and to recharge their batteries, so they can begin a new term with the enthusiasm and excitement that they want to convey to their pupils. Gove&apos;s policy will lower the quality of education in this country and should be resisted at all costs. Of course the real reason he wants it implemented has nothing to do with education and all to do with childminding. In his mind, schools are about keeping children out of the home so that their parents can spend more time at work. Now what was that David Cameron said back in 2011 about the government promoting quality of life?Richard StainerBury St Edmunds, Suffolk \u2022 Michael Gove is so desperate to don the mantle of &quot;hard man of the right&quot; that he is willing to sacrifice the education of hundreds of thousands of school children on a policy that&apos;s based on anecdote and whimsy. There is no empirical evidence to suggest that longer hours and shorter holidays mean higher standards. It is the quality of the teachers and the teaching that matters. It was interesting that one of the rightwing tabloids came up with the headline to this story as &quot;Mr Gove warns of more strikes&quot;. With irrational and thoughtless comments on policies like these, Mr Gove almost guarantees more industrial action which is, after all, what he really desires more than anything else, so he can be seen as challenging the &quot;enemies\u00a0of promise&quot;.Simon GosdenRayleigh, Essex \u2022 We were disappointed to note that Michael Gove aligned Britain to east Asian countries for educational comparisons, rather than the European or North American countries which the government uses elsewhere as the most relevant models for comparison. One of us is a teacher who has worked in Japan and seen the psychological impact of high educational results expected of pupils. Having seen children appear visibly stressed, fall asleep in lessons or require counselling \u2013 and with occasional cases of suicide not unheard of within the teaching community \u2013 we feel that it would be unwise to replicate the model, or its associated ethic, in the UK. We can only presume that Gove&apos;s thorough research has recognised but discounted the positive models of European education we could learn from.Hannah Murray and Samuel MilesExeter \u2022 One of the chief reasons students in Singapore and Hong Kong outperform western pupils is not a longer school day or shorter holidays, but private tutoring. According to a study published last year by the Asian Development Bank, the money parents spend on private tutoring in these countries is &quot;staggering&quot;. In Hong Kong in 2011, for example, tutoring for secondary-school pupils alone brought in $255m, while, in Japan, families paid out $12bn to ensure their children were ahead in the exam race. Private tutors have become stars \u2013 and millionaires. Perhaps Michael Gove has actually found a new career path for our own hard-done by teachers.Lisa FreedmanLondon \u2022 Would Gove also be in favour of extending the parliamentary day and cutting the length of all the parliamentary recesses?

Trade facilitation refers to a broad range of reforms that aim to streamline the movement of goods and services across national borders. Proponents of trade facilitation say that reducing the transaction costs of international trade can create economic wealth, especially in developing countries, where red tape and other procedural barriers to trade tend to be high. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has estimated that even a 1% reduction in such &quot;hidden costs&quot; would boost the global economy by $40bn (\u00a326bn), with most of those benefits going to the developing world. What exactly does trade facilitation do? Trade facilitation means encouraging \u2013 or perhaps requiring \u2013 countries to adopt measures such as publishing their import and export procedures; reducing the number of forms that importers and exporters are required to complete; allowing forms to be submitted online; and tackling corruption at border crossings. All the reforms that fall under the rubric of trade facilitation aim to increase the efficiency of trade, while also reducing the cost. Why should we care about this now? Negotiators at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been trying to negotiate a global deal on trade facilitation since 2004. After nearly nine years of negotiations, they have come up with a draft negotiating text which, although far from complete (square brackets denote areas of disagreement), offers a fairly comprehensive view of what a final agreement might look like. With the WTO&apos;s broader Doha round negotiations at an impasse, delegates hope that an agreement on trade facilitation could serve as the linchpin in a pared-down global trade deal that negotiators are aiming to reach at a high-level meeting in Bali in December. Is trade facilitation good for developing countries? The consensus among economists is an unambiguous yes. According to a 2009 report from the OECD, about two-thirds of the benefits of a global trade facilitation deal would go to developing countries. A subsequent study found that wide-ranging trade facilitation reforms would lower the costs of trade by 14.5% in low-income countries, compared with 10% in the rich OECD countries. The OECD cites evidence that reducing the &quot;thickness&quot; of national borders can help poor countries attract foreign direct investment and generate more customs revenue. Trade facilitation reforms would certainly be a good idea for economic growth more broadly: WTO director-general Pascal Lamy said this year that a multilateral deal on trade facilitation could add $1tn to the global economy. Why are some developing countries nervous about trade facilitation? Some low-income countries worry that they might struggle to implement the reforms that a new multilateral agreement on trade facilitation would require. They fear being penalised for failing to fully adopt reforms that might be beyond their technical or financial reach. Bilateral donors and multilateral agencies such as the WTO, the International Trade Centre, Unctad and the World Bank have promised to offer help on this front. However, many developing countries have said that they will sign up to a trade facilitation deal only if they are promised concessions in other areas in return. But aren&apos;t tariffs (import taxes) the biggest barrier to international trade? Not by a long shot. And that&apos;s largely because tariff levels have been dropping steadily, with a few exceptions, since the second world war. World tariffs have fallen from an average of more than 20% (pdf) in the 1930s to less than 3% in 2010. Given that tariff levels are already fairly low around the world, economists say (doc) that cutting trade-related red tape, either instead of or in addition to further tariff reductions, is the most effective way to encourage trade and economic growth, in rich and poor countries alike. Which countries have the worst red tape? According to the World Bank&apos;s latest Doing Business Index, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and the Central African Republic rank lowest in terms of the ease of trading across borders (pdf). Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Denmark rank highest. Nine sub-Saharan African countries \u2013 including Niger, Burundi, Chad and Burkina Faso \u2013 fall in the bottom 10% on the &quot;trading across borders&quot; measure. In Chad, for example, it takes an average 101 days and costs an average $8,525 to import a container of goods; in Singapore, the same process costs $439 and takes four days to complete."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/apr/22/michael-gove-school-holidays-error", "sentences": ["He was reported as saying we should emulate Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Vietnam.", "But in Singapore there is a long school break this year, from 16 November to 31 December, which is six weeks."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-22T18:45:01Z", "title": "Education in brief: Is Michael Gove right about shorter holidays?", "tags": ["School holidays", "Academies", "National curriculum", "Schools", "Education", "Social mobility", "Society"], "article": "Holiday facts England&apos;s schools should think about lengthening the working day and cutting the holidays, as this seems to work in the Far East, Michael Gove told reporters last week. This won coverage for different practices in some academy schools. But is his claim about what goes on in the far east true? It seems not, at least in respect of summer holidays. He was reported as saying we should emulate Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Vietnam. But in Singapore there is a long school break this year, from 16 November to 31 December, which is six weeks. In Hong Kong , the government specifies an annual minimum of 190 teaching days, the same as here. In China, holidays seem to start in early July and end in late August, while in high-performing Shanghai last year they seemed to run from 28 June to 23\u00a0August: eight weeks. Most European countries have summer holidays of at least nine weeks. We recently fact-checked a claim from Gove about &quot;easy&quot; science GCSE questions. We&apos;re beginning to wonder if this column needs to fact-check every time the education secretary speaks. It&apos;s a bad, bad world It&apos;s fair to say that England&apos;s new &quot;national&quot; curriculum \u2013 &quot;national&quot; is in quotes as it won&apos;t apply to academies \u2013 is not proving universally popular. Last month, Gove went on the offensive  against 100 academics who wrote a letter to complain that the proposed 2014 curriculum &quot;promotes rote learning without understanding&quot;. There has been a petition signed by 2,500 people, led by teacher Debra Kidd, and a letter endorsed by broadcaster David Attenborough and prominent environmentalists criticising the apparent downgrading of discussions on climate change in geography. But this only scratches the surface of complaints. Other recent developments include a Historical Association survey of 1,600 teachers, which found only 4% saying the proposed history curriculum was a positive development and 96% saying it was too prescriptive. Another petition organised by schoolgirl Esha Marwaha about the climate change move now has nearly 30,000 signatures. A survey by the charity Hamilton Maths Projects has seen more than 11,000 teachers saying that some topics \u2013 such as long multiplication and division \u2013 should not be taught too early in pupils&apos; lives. There are 102 signatories, including some leading subject associations, to a union-led petition saying the new curriculum will not raise standards, while a protest on the 38 Degrees website has nearly 2,000 signatures. The business lobby group the CBI said the curriculum &quot;doesn&apos;t pass the test&quot; while Score, representing five science organisations, said the science curriculum &quot;will not achieve its aims&quot; and &quot;lacks coherence&quot;. Robin Alexander, who led an exhaustive review of primary education from 2006 to 2010, wrote of concerns the curriculum was &quot;educationally unsound and evidentially questionable&quot; while Mary James, Cambridge University professor and a member of Gove&apos;s expert group on the curriculum, has written that the proposals &quot;seem a massive and rushed experiment&quot;. There is the odd voice in support, including the Royal Geographical Society and the English Association. But perhaps it is understandable if Gove wants to talk about other things, like holidays. Restricted mobility Why is the new board of the Sutton Trust, the charity that promotes social mobility, dominated by white males from banking and finance? Of the 18 members, 14 have investment backgrounds, while four are directors or former directors of the banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. There are only three women, only one member is from an ethnic minority and none seems to have teaching experience. Asked to comment, the trust, which has backed at least one policy with a corporate ring to it \u2013 performance pay for teachers \u2013 said the board was &quot;composed of people who are making substantial financial contributions to the work of the trust, either individually or through their foundations&quot;. It added: &quot;The trust works closely with thousands of teachers each year.&quot; Going for Roke Parents at a school facing &quot;forced academy&quot; status are livid after the Harris chain advertised for a new headteacher before a consultation exercise on the proposal had finished. The advert for a new head of Roke primary school, in Kenley, Surrey, appeared on Friday, the final day of a consultation \u2013 also carried out by Harris \u2013 on whether or not the school should re-open in September under the Harris Federation. Parent Joanna Hearn said: &quot;How can they advertise the job when there is a consultation still taking place?&quot; Harris says it has advertised now because &quot;headteachers need to give notice by 31 May if they wish to take up the post in September \u2026 and we needed to allow time for a fair and thorough selection process&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/22/qatar-biggest-spending-tourists-eu", "sentences": ["e Other tourists visiting from the Far East, who primarily spend their cash in London, have also been spending more, with Thai tourists spending \u00a3848, up 47%, and shoppers from Singapore spending \u00a3551 on average, up 20%."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-22T19:31:59Z", "title": "Qataris officially biggest spending tourists outside the EU", "tags": ["Qatar", "Consumer affairs", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "UK news", "Money", "Shopping trips", "Retail industry", "Business"], "article": "The Qataris may be keen on snapping up the best British assets, but it seems they are equally fond of emptying their wallets in the UK high street.

Teach First, the charity sending high-flying graduates into deprived areas is launching a campaign to break the cycle of educational disadvantage. Inviting people from other professions to teach for a day lets outsiders understand modern education. The experience will shoot down battalions of myths about schools, teachers and teaching methods, misrepresentations too often spread by the education secretary himself. Half of Fazakerley&apos;s pupils are on free school meals in this mostly white, poor district. The school is rated &quot;good&quot; by Ofsted, and half got five good GCSEs, including English and maths \u2013 improving at twice the national average rate \u2013 with 92% getting five passes. It&apos;s a bright, airy school, quiet and orderly, no corridor scrums between lessons; students are friendly with teachers, giving a warmth to the place that goes with the head making it a &quot;family school&quot;. I was assigned to Chris Brolly, a Teach First-er in his third year. His 12- and 13-year-olds have been inventing a product \u2013 bottled water \u2013 and it&apos;s my task to help them write a press release. Can they create their own USP, write a grabby headline, hold the fleeting attention of a journalist, persuade with seductive language? Chris has sent me advice on how to organise a 50-minute lesson in five- or 10-minute segments and use the white board to hold their gaze. Trying not to sound too nervous, I give them cards with words that might suit their product, posting up sample press releases as they write out their own. The class is kindly to this beginner, encouraging and keen. I watched Chris&apos;s techniques with care: he stands at the door, shaking hands and greeting each student by name, obliging them to speak up and look him in the eye, setting a tone for the lesson that is friendly and calm: no slouching, no grunting. What strikes me is how well-thought out is every minute of his lessons. What I don&apos;t know \u2013 and research is thin \u2013 is how real learning gets from teacher to pupil, the thinking, the educating. No wonder politics focuses on the mechanics of who runs schools, or the testing regime. Yet what matters is what happens right here: maybe different for each child, but too ineffable for politics. The curse of the teaching profession is that everyone thinks they know how it should be done. All ministers think they know best from memories that are decades out of date \u2013 however they were educated, it worked: QED. They arrive eager to announce change, convinced voters want children Gradgrind-ed. Teachers are forever told to &quot;bring back spelling, times tables and uniforms&quot;, as if they ever went away. Or they are plagued by History Boys romance: &quot;In my day we had inspirational eccentric teachers&quot; \u2013 as if these too are no more. Beating up teachers is everyday politics \u2013 aided, alas, by the annual ritual of a few union hotheads paraded on news bulletins at the NUT&apos;s Easter conference. But by any measure teaching has vastly improved, moving on Labour&apos;s watch from a low-rank profession to one highly favoured by graduates. The discipline of the curriculum, lesson preparation and assessment is unrecognisable from ministers&apos; schooldays \u2013 yet the call to weed out bad teachers is a political imperative. Michael Gove&apos;s latest evidence-free policy is that chestnut, performance-related pay, to be imposed on all schools. Almost all evidence shows it doesn&apos;t work, or does harm. Extensive research by the LSE&apos;s David Marsden concludes that bribing public-sector professionals to work harder makes no difference, while causing resentment and division. What works is good staff appraisal and goal-setting, but it&apos;s a Conservative tenet that only money motivates people. PRP only works with low-paid piece-rate working \u2013 strawberry picking \u2013 but doesn&apos;t motivate civil servants, teachers or nurses. PRP is in decline in the private sector, according to Alex Bryson of the Centre for Economic Performance. In an era of pay freezes, managers use it less and less. They easily identify the few who are outstanding or failing, but the great majority are always in the middle where forcing spurious distinctions that account for small sums of money &quot;causes a lot of grief&quot;, says Marsden. In most professions, as in teaching, it&apos;s hard to know who&apos;s responsible for improvements. Christine Rourke, the head of Fazakerley High, says she has no need of further incentives: she can already reward high performers to keep them in the classroom. Appraisals and teachers peer-reviewing one another are key. But Ofsted inspectors will demand proof she has used performance pay What motivates pupils? At the end of class I asked them to write down what they wanted to do after school: they all had ambitions, some maybe higher than they will reach. While ministers blame &quot;lack of aspiration&quot;, these children have plenty. But only a third of pupils who get good GCSE grades are on free school meals. A YouGov poll finds most voters don&apos;t think poorer children will ever get an equal education. Gove, calling for payment by results, cited Singapore&apos;s high-achieving school system, &quot;where expectations are higher&quot;. What he didn&apos;t say is that Singapore, like top performer Finland, is one of the most equal of developed nations.

These files remain classified under the terms of Section 3.4 of the 1958 Public Records Act, which permits government departments to withhold from public view any historic document &quot;required for administrative purposes&quot; or that &quot;ought to be retained for any other special reason&quot;. The Foreign Office declined to disclose the reasons for deciding that specific files should be withheld, with the result that the reason for the continuing secrecy is itself, at this stage, a secret. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: &quot;We are committed to making as many files as we can from our colonial archives available to the public. These files are an important part of our history. By the end of our programme, we&apos;ll have released some 18,000 files. On average, only 1% of material has been withheld from release.&quot; The secret archive was discovered by a number of historians, including David Anderson, professor of African politics at Oxford, who were working for the legal team that represented the Mau Mau veterans as they fought for the right to sue to the British government for the mistreatment they suffered as prisoners of the British in 1950s Kenya. The government had acknowledged that their accounts of appalling torture are true, but is continuing to contest their right to claim damages, saying that a fair trial is impossible after so many years. During a series of hearings the Foreign Office acknowledged that the archive existed, and that it contained 200 boxes of files: 1.5 tons of paper that covered about 200 metres of shelving. Lord Howell, then Foreign Office minister, said that the documents had been brought to the UK not only from Kenya, but from 37 different colonies and protectorates including Aden, Ceylon, Cyprus, Malaya, Malta, Nigeria and Northern Rhodesia. For several years the secret archive was housed at Hanslope Park in Buckinghamshire, inside the highly secure premises of Her Majesty&apos;s Government Communications Centre. This is a facility where teams of scientists \u2013 real-life versions of Q, the fictional boffin of the James Bond films \u2013 work behind five metre-high fences topped with razor wire to devise technical aids for MI5 and MI6. An inquiry commissioned by Hague established that the files were first stored in Hayes, west London, before being moved to Hanslope Park, where staff were led to believe that they belonged to another organisation called Hayes and not to the FCO. Anthony Cary, the former British high commissioner to Canada, who conducted the investigation, reported that &quot;a canard that was widely shared and passed down during handovers&quot; included the explanation that the FCO was holding the archive because there had been a fire at Hayes. In this way it was never assessed for declassification, as the law required, and placed beyond reach of the Freedom of Information Act. Once the bulk of the material began to be handed over to the National Archive, it became clear that many of Britain&apos;s late colonial-era official papers were not archived anywhere, but destroyed. Thousands of documents containing evidence of official misdeeds committed in the years in the years before independence were either incinerated or dumped at sea. Surviving scraps of documents show that colonial officials in some colonies, such as Kenya, were told that there should be a presumption in favour of disposal of documents rather than removal to the UK \u2013 &quot;emphasis is placed upon destruction&quot; \u2013 and that no trace of either the documents or their incineration should remain. When documents were burned, officials were told that &quot;the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up&quot;. Some idea of the scale of the destruction operations can be gleaned from instruction documents that survived the purge. In certain circumstances, officials in Kenya were informed, &quot;it is permissible, as an alternative to destruction by fire, for documents to be packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/apr/28/asadal-korean-restaurant-review", "sentences": ["We didn&apos;t colonise Korea (China, Malaysia, Singapore) or go there on our holidays (Thailand)."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-28T06:30:01Z", "title": "Asadal: restaurant review", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style", "Travel"], "article": "229-231 High Holborn, London WC1 (020 7430 9006).

But just what to eat? How best to celebrate what is either, depending on your viewpoint, the impending failure of international diplomacy or the most gargantuan, delayed-adolescent hissy fit in history? No contest: it has to be Korean. If Kim Jong-un is determined to press the button and take the rest of us with him, I want to go with the flavours of his food on my lips. Think of it as an act of defiance. Welcome, then, to a lovely table at the end of the world. Which happens to be in a basement space next to Holborn station. Look, I\u00a0tried to get myself attached to an LSE student tour of North Korea, but it didn&apos;t happen. I know. As a journalist I&apos;ve failed. Holborn will have to do. As far as Britain is concerned, Korean food is the also-ran of Asian culinary traditions. We didn&apos;t colonise Korea (China, Malaysia, Singapore) or go there on our holidays (Thailand). The restaurants here arrived to serve an expat community clustered around New Malden in south London. There are a few more\u00a0in the centre of the capital, of which Asadal is, apparently, regarded as one of\u00a0the best. Online it gets lots of thumbs-up icons, smiley emoticons and stars from reviewers who may not all be from the restaurant itself. Not unreasonably: an unpromising doorway leads down to a sultry space of downlighters, wood carvings behind glass and varnished-wood tables inlaid with gas-powered barbecues. On a rainy night when the airwaves are full of stirring patriotic songs out of Pyongyang, it&apos;s a pleasant place to be. If only eating there wasn&apos;t so knackering. Gosh but there&apos;s a lot of admin with Korean food. Everything has to be dredged or dipped and rolled and dipped again. Fiddle here. Turn there. Flip this. And if they think you&apos;re getting it wrong, a waiter will be at your side taking over, heaving with body language which says: &quot;You have no idea!&quot; Which, I suppose, I don&apos;t. I have eaten Korean food before, most memorably in the last place in LA&apos;s Koreatown where the barbecue was over coals. But that was run by scary women who seemed furious to see you and weren&apos;t about to help. Here they are at least friendly. We start with a kimchi set, which is only one dish of fermented, chilli-spiked cabbage, alongside another of chilli-drenched cucumber and one of a crunchy root vegetable I fail to identify. It&apos;s three takes on the same flavour. Kang poong gi is a deep-fried chicken dish drenched in a sweet chilli sauce which tastes like every cheap plate of Chinese American food I&apos;ve ever eaten \u2013 that sugary infantile hit which helps grease you down the road to insulin dependency. Bin dae duk are small, dull, crisp-shelled pancakes that have the virtue of having taken a bath in the deep-fat fryer. So far this Korean food is the holy trinity of salt, fat and sugar. The barbecue dishes \u2013 half-inch thin medallions of rib-eye the colour of a Tory grandee&apos;s trousers, some pearlescent butterflied king prawns \u2013 are much better. While they sear over the gas flame we are shown the rituals: pile into crisp lettuce leaf, add some shredded and sauce-smeared spring onions and a\u00a0bit of spicy bean paste, roll up, then dredge through a\u00a0couple more sauces. And if by that point your will to live hasn&apos;t entirely departed, finally you can eat. You try keeping the thread of a conversation going through all that. A classic bibimbab \u2013 a rice dish with minced beef, vegetables and more chilli paste which cooks over a hot stone as it sits in front of you \u2013 was, amid all the edible bureaucracy, a\u00a0moment&apos;s comfort food. There is no dessert to speak of other than fresh fruit, and a wine list with some truly awful choices at inflated prices. It&apos;s probably best to order beer. In short, as a restaurant experience it was more interesting than satisfying. Not that I really mind. Hell, it&apos;s only dinner. It&apos;s not like it&apos;s the end of the world.

By odd coincidence, there are now two separate films documenting the early stages of this presumed shift in power. One is a part-finished film currently hawking for final funds on Kickstarter. Baisikeli: The Story of an African Cycling Team, made by a small, Cape Town-based production company, tells the amazing story of the beginnings of Kenya&apos;s national bike squad. It&apos;s one, oddly enough, I&apos;d heard before, from my Guardian colleague Adharanand Finn, who decamped with his young family to the heartland of Kenyan running to write a book about the region&apos;s athletes and their astonishing feats. There he met Nicholas Leong, who decided that if Kenyans were that good at running they must be good at cycling. His almost absurdly simple plan to was to follow the winners of the 2005 Singapore marathon back to their home town. He ended up in Iten, the same place as Finn was later based. His recruitment technique was almost as simple: Leong erected a billboard at the foot of a long, steep road climb, saying anyone who completed it in less than 34 minutes on one of the weighty local bikes would claim a 100,000 shilling prize, a vast sum for the area, worth about \u00a31,500. By the time the film begins, in 2012, the team has a professional set-up and is racing in the Tour of Rwanda, one of the highlights of the UCI&apos;s Africa Tour series.    Rising From Ashes from T.C. Johnstone on Vimeo.   As it happens, Rwanda is the setting for the second film, Rising from the Ashes. Already finished it has its UK premiere in London&apos;s West End on 9 May. This follows a similar course, charting the establishment of Rwanda&apos;s national squad, with efforts led by the US former professional rider, Jonathan &quot;Jacques&quot; Boyer, the first American to ride in the Tour de France. Boyer has been largely based in Rwanda since 2007. Overlaying the story is the fact that many of the team lost numerous relatives in Rwanda&apos;s brief but appallingly brutal and bloody 1994 genocide. Among these was Adrien Niyonshuti, who lost six of his brothers. The documentary follows the efforts of Niyonshuti to qualify for the mountain biking event at the London 2012 Olympics, where he eventually finished 39th in the men&apos;s cross country. That leaves the question: will an African cyclist, particularly an East African cyclist, one day win the Tour de France or another major race?  At the moment the continent remains a road cycling minnow. There are no African teams in the UCI&apos;s World Tour and just one in its second tier Professional Continental circuit, MTN Qhubeka. It is South African, and mainly has South African and European riders, though among the number are Niyonshuti, and Eritrea&apos;s Meron Russom. Given that his book was subtitled &quot;Discovering the secrets of the fastest people on earth&quot;, Finn gets regularly asked why Kenyan runners are so quick, and his answers have some bearing on this. As you&apos;d expect there are a host of factors, including altitude (Iten is 2,400m above sea level) and diet. But the most important thing seems to be the sheer amount local people run: many Kenyan children run to school and the money available to top athletes, and the clusters of training camps around Iten, mean anyone with any talent gets funneled into the sport. The challenge for cycling, of course, is to compete with that, especially as a pursuit which, by definition, needs a big piece of equipment rather than just your own two feet. So maybe hold off the bets for now."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/apr/29/iron-man-3-storms-box-office", "sentences": ["It broke all-time opening weekend records in Argentina, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T12:38:09Z", "title": "Iron Man 3 storms box office with US yet to come", "tags": ["Iron Man 3", "Action and adventure", "Science fiction and fantasy", "Robert Downey Jr", "Ben Kingsley", "Gwyneth Paltrow", "Culture", "Film", "Superhero movies", "The Avengers"], "article": "     The superhero sequel Iron Man 3 opened with $195.3m (\u00a3125.6m) at the global box office this weekend, placing the film on course to surpass the $1.5m haul secured by last year&apos;s highest-grossing movie, The Avengers. The total is all the more impressive because the $200m Marvel Studios film, which stars Robert Downey Jr, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Kingsley, has not yet opened in the US. It is by far the largest opening of any film of 2013 so far, ahead of Oz the Great and Powerful&apos;s $149m in March.

But Malaysia&apos;s prime minister, Najib Razak, who will be heading to the polls this Sunday for the country&apos;s most hotly contested elections to date, may well weather this political storm. His ruling coalition, the Barisan Nasional (BN), is one of the world&apos;s longest-serving governments and has led Malaysia since independence from Britain in 1957. As it is largely credited with having turned this backwater into the strong economy it is today, Najib is riding this wave of fiscal success, as well as a series of recent political reforms, to ask Malaysia&apos;s 29 million population: &quot;Who says change is good for you?&quot;. In rallies he has warned that a defeat for BN would be &quot;a catastrophic ruin for the country&quot;. It is a fear-mongering strategy that has some clout among voters, says Wan Saiful Wan Jan of the Malaysian thinktank Ideas. &quot;A change of government is something really unthinkable for many Malaysians, and that fear is what the BN is riding on,&quot; he says. &quot;They argue that if there is change, there will be chaos.&quot; But not everyone in Malaysia agrees. Nearly one-fifth of the country&apos;s 13.3 million registered voters are under 30, and Malaysia&apos;s youth are not afraid to use their ballots to speak their minds. Rising living costs, endemic corruption and affirmative action policies favouring Malays over ethnic Chinese and Indians are among voters&apos; complaints. Then there is also an ongoing investigation into a citizenship-for-votes scandal in Sabah, the prime minister&apos;s alleged involvement in a shady French submarine deal, and an armed Filipino insurgency on Malaysian territory in March that left 70 dead. A recent Merdeka poll found that voters aged 21 to 30 were those most unhappy with the prime minister&apos;s performance, while another poll showed that 52% of new voters were planning to vote for opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, 65, who has promised a &quot;Malaysian spring&quot; ushering in a merit-based system and a government clean-up. Najib&apos;s government has faced allegations of corruption over a $2bn purchase of French Scorp\u00e8ne submarines in 2002 when Najib was defence minister. But the case \u2013 which is currently being investigated by French justices \u2013 is a complicated and murky one, as it is linked to the mysterious and gruesome murder in 2006 of a Mongolian model and translator who had been hired to help negotiate the Scorp\u00e8ne deal. Although two of Najib&apos;s bodyguards were convicted of her murder and imprisoned, Najib himself has long denied any wrongdoing and alleges instead that the accusations are an attempt to derail him politically. Najib, 59, is facing tension within his own coalition as well. The BN suffered its greatest political setback in 2008 when Anwar&apos;s opposition coalition stole five of Malaysia&apos;s 13 states and one-third of parliament&apos;s seats, an electoral result that ousted Najib&apos;s predecessor from office. Najib now needs to win this election in order to rule Malaysia under his own mandate \u2013 but analysts conjecture that if the BN were to lose any more seats on Sunday, Najib could easily be replaced as leader of the country. That may explain why Najib&apos;s party, Umno, has invested heavily in this election, says Malaysia expert Bridget Welsh at Singapore Management University. According to Welsh&apos;s research, Najib&apos;s administration has spent nearly 60bn ringgit (\u00a313bn) on &quot;election-related incentives&quot; in the past four years, making this the most costly runup to any election in Malaysia&apos;s history. Billboards around the country allude to the incumbent coalition as a produk, or product, that lasts. Voters have been offered food coupons and cash for attending Umno meetings, while Najib himself has handed out thousands of cash bonuses to state-linked corporate employees. &quot;There is a clear orientation to find potential groups of voters, identify their immediate needs, and provide it,&quot; Welsh recently wrote in online news portal Malaysiakini. &quot;The bottom line in the BN&apos;s strategy is that it assumes Malaysians can be bought.&quot; Banquets, dinners and free concerts \u2013 where guests are enticed by prize draws, free gifts and fundraising appearances by stars such as Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh \u2013 are used by parties to woo voters in hotly contested states including Penang, says political scientist Wong Chin Huat of the Coalition for Clean and Fair Elections. &quot;There is no effective law on political contributions or funding, so you can actually throw out money from politicians or parties and not be held accountable at all,&quot; he says. Winning control of Penang \u2013 a Chinese-majority state currently held by the opposition \u2013 is key to both sides, as Malaysian politics is almost entirely divided by race. Critics say the BN has done much to pit Malaysia&apos;s ethnic groups against each other in an effort to maintain power. While Malays comprise the largest ethnicity in Malaysia, they are also said to enjoy preferential treatment in business, education and employment, a legacy of the race riots between ethnic Chinese and ethnic Malays in 1969 that many fear could one day recur. &quot;The government has capitalised on that [fear], saying &apos;Malaysia is multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multilingual, and to avoid bloodshed you should have a strong government,&apos;&quot; says Wong. But it seems that way of thinking may be losing clout \u2013 particularly with Malaysia&apos;s youth, who are more interested in inclusivity and opportunity than division. When Najib introduced Korea&apos;s Gangnam Style pop star Psy on a Penang fundraising stage in February, he may have proved just how far the BN is from understanding that. &quot;Are you ready for Psy?&quot; Najib bellowed into the microphone, to thunderous shouts of &quot;Yes!&quot;. Najib then asked: &quot;Are you ready for BN?&quot; The crowd&apos;s answer? A resounding &quot;No&quot;. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2013. The original said that according to Bridget Welsh&apos;s research, &quot;Najib&apos;s administration has spent nearly 60bn ringgit (\u00a313m) on election-related campaigning in the past four years&quot;. To clarify: the figure of 60bn ringgit (which is actually about \u00a313bn), is not official campaign funding but government expenditure that Welsh regards as being spent for political advantage."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/may/01/professional-development-future-of-teaching", "sentences": ["Other countries such as Korea, Canada, Singapore and Australia are much further along the path of CPD and career reform than we are, but our need for great teachers to reduce educational inequality is even greater given that the gaps in attainment between our most and least disadvantaged pupils are larger."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-01T16:10:00Z", "title": "The future of career progression in teaching", "tags": ["Professional development", "Career advice", "Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching"], "article": "Teaching is one of the great altruistic professions. We join it to help others: to nurture their talents, to overcome the disadvantage of their backgrounds, and to share with them our joyful love of learning. We grow as teachers as we become more successful at helping our students and yet the recognised career pathways in our profession take us, in general, further away from the reason we joined in the first place. Measuring great teaching It is always controversial to try and define &apos;great teaching&apos; because it is equally (if not more) controversial to attempt a definition of a &apos;great education&apos;. Unlike medics with their stark binary measures of life and death, we can only deal with proxies such as exam grades, but it&apos;s important that we keep fighting for clarity around teacher quality if we want to be rewarded for being good at our jobs rather than simply taking on ever-longer lists of responsibilities. Teacher quality is an unclear and often-contradictory area in research. While some studies suggest that good teachers can be spotted from characteristics of leadership, perseverance, sense of mission and prior academic achievement, the evidence is weak. Subject knowledge appears to make little difference in most areas, and there are few practices that every great teacher appears to share. Single-person observations have been shown to be relatively unreliable and even measures of &apos;value-added&apos; in test scores appear to be unstable and poorly correlated with quality of teaching. Nevertheless progress is being made in this area. The multi-million pound research project, Measures of Effective Teaching carried out by the deep-pocketed Gates Foundation showed that when student perceptions are mathematically combined with value-added indicators and two or more observation-ratings from trained observers then we begin to reach a reasonable level of reliability. With ever-improving understanding of how to judge teaching quality we now need to focus on how to help teachers improve. How to foster great teaching Three ways of looking at this problem produce identical conclusions. The first is to consider the growing body of literature on general expertise that suggests that mastery is gained through thousands of hours of deliberate, focused practice combined with clear feedback, expert advice and time for reflection. The second is to look at the literature around how effective practices identified in research become embedded in every frontline practice. In medicine, education, criminal justice and social care the conclusions are consistent: sustained cycles of implementation over long periods, constant interaction between professionals, rigorous and on-going evaluation, feedback, adaptation and refinement. The final approach is to examine the growing research around the types of teacher professional development that result in improved outcomes for students. Once again this shows that these processes are sustained (at least 50 hours in repeated cycles), supported and challenged by experts, targeted at improved learning outcomes (rather than solely on changed teacher behaviours), collaborative and constantly evaluated. These lessons are unambiguous, and yet the vast majority of teacher professional development remains superficial, isolated and one-off, and almost always lacking the sustained challenge and on-going evaluation and feedback that is called for. As a result, teachers rarely make significant improvements in skill and schools barely ever undertake the rigorous analysis that would enable them to notice. Indeed some research suggests that as few as 7% of schools attempt to evaluate the effect of continuing professional development on pupil attainment. A new Royal College of Teaching needs to campaign to improve the quality of professional development for all teachers, with a greater emphasis on use of research evidence as a starting point, more rigorous use of evaluation both before, during and after the CPD process. It needs to ensure that teachers are driving their own improvement rather than waiting to be trained and told what to do. We need to rethink career structures With such a current lack of emphasis on rigorous improvement in teaching quality, it is perhaps little wonder that career progression is centred on the easily quantifiable: how many additional responsibilities, what magnitude, and how many people are being line-managed. Teachers are rewarded for taking on longer lists of tasks instead of being recognised for their teaching prowess. Attempts to introduce recognition for general and specialist expertise (in the form of advanced skills teacher, excellent teacher and chartered teacher statuses) did not catch on in any widespread and systematic way \u2013 even at their peak only 1% of the teaching population were ASTs or ETs. The results of this imbalance are clear. Around 4 in 5 teachers at or beyond their fourth year of teaching have taken on some form of administration or leadership responsibility. Teachers got in to the job to help children learn and grow, so when they are forced to take on ever more managerial tasks to get any sense of growth there is an inevitable tension. Indeed, the main reasons cited for leaving the profession (ignoring issues around personal circumstance) are workload and stress along with wanting change and wanting new challenge. Moving in a better direction We need to ensure that we can nurture and retain the talent in our profession while improving outcomes for pupils. It seems very clear that in order to do that we need to make significant changes to career progression and professional development. Firstly, reform professional development so that it is focused on helping pupils learn and so that it is collaborative, sustained, evaluated, and aimed and achieving teaching mastery. Secondly we need to introduce new models of career progression where administrative and leadership roles are only one of three main strands, the other two being a succession of increasingly senior general teaching practitioner levels and a similar succession for specialist teachers (for example, mathematics, geography, literacy, SEN, assessment, and so on). These levels of skill could be linked to membership of the new proposed Royal College of Teaching. There are some encouraging signs that the system is gradually moving in the right direction. Teaching schools are a welcome addition to the education landscape by ensuring that clusters of schools can develop specialist leaders of education, focus on research and development, carry out collaborative professional development, identify untapped talent and potential and find more opportunities for progression within a large and more flexible alliance. Moves for a Royal College of Teaching suggest that there may be changes to the career structures in the coming years, and the combining of the Teaching Agency and National College for School Leadership hint at a renewed focus on improving professional development by the Department for Education. The sooner these strands come together the better. Other countries such as Korea, Canada, Singapore and Australia are much further along the path of CPD and career reform than we are, but our need for great teachers to reduce educational inequality is even greater given that the gaps in attainment between our most and least disadvantaged pupils are larger. It&apos;s time for organisations across the educational spectrum, whether charities or unions, schools, subject associations or government agencies, to come together and move decisively toward a better and more effective teaching profession.

Each represents a landmark in slashing the Royal Bank of Scotland back to a more manageable size. Cullinan is the bank&apos;s bomb disposal expert. For the past four years the retailer turned private equity expert has been tracking down \u2013 then selling off or winding up \u2013 the unexploded ordnance sitting on the bank&apos;s balance sheet. His targets have included bad loans, troublesome trading positions and overambitious expansion into areas such as planes and pubs \u2013 anything that might have blown another hole in RBS&apos;s fragile capital position. At the outset, the bank&apos;s &quot;non-core&quot; division held about \u00a3258bn of unwanted trading positions, loans and businesses. &quot;The size of Singapore and Hong Kong,&quot; he said, quipping that the scale of the problem was so large, he thought about it in terms of the size of countries. RBS has confirmed that the division was on track to be shut down at the end of the year, leaving a more manageable \u00a340bn of unwanted but less troublesome legacy loans and trading positions. Cullinan calculates his team will have conducted 1,000 transactions by the time the project is complete. So far, of the \u00a3258bn the non-core division was charged with defusing, about \u00a320bn has been written off, \u00a3110bn of trading positions and loans have been run off and \u00a390bn of businesses have been sold in a series of deals under codenames picked by Cullinan and his colleagues to hide the details of their negotiations from outsiders.     RBS disposals so far - click for the full graphic    One is named after one of his daughters (Isobel), while a colleague favoured trees (Chestnut, Birch), and a series is named after moons and planets. Around 16,000 people worked in non-core at the start; it now has 2,600 staff. A close friend and former hunting chum of RBS boss Stephen Hester, Cullinan said: &quot;[RBS] has been called the biggest restructuring in the world.&quot; Cullinan, 53, was hired at 6.30 in the morning one day in December 2008 when RBS was still on the brink of collapse. After a handshake with John Hourican, who quit as the head of the investment bank last month in the wake of the \u00a3390m Libor fine, Cullinan agreed to a return to an organisation he had left four years earlier, when it was still run by Fred Goodwin and chasing the super-fast growth that ultimately led to its near-demise. He had been running the private equity arm of RBS, was involved in a number of deals, including Southern Water and faced criticism that he might have to unwind some of his own deals. As well as dealing with exotic trading positions that became illiquid during the credit crunch, Cullinan has sold off car parks and hotels \u2013 such as the Grosvenor hotel in London \u2013 as well as a string of pubs and film financing deals. The scaling back was in part due to conditions imposed on RBS by Brussels following its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout, such as selling the commodities broker Sempra, which went to US investment bank JP Morgan. The aircraft leasing operation was disposed of for \u00a34.7bn to Sumitomo Mitsui under the code name Tess. The bank recorded an \u00a38m loss on that sale last year. Chestnut, a bundle of project finance assets, was sold for \u00a32.9bn, while Isobel was a property deal with Blackstone worth \u00a31.4.bn. Cullinan&apos;s office contains a jumble of lucites \u2013 transparent ornaments that City types hoard as mementos when deals are done \u2013 including several for complex financial trades and one to mark the signing of the asset protection scheme (APS), codenamed Waterstone, under which taxpayers guaranteed toxic RBS loans and prevented total nationalisation of the bank. Creating the APS dominated Cullinan&apos;s first months at RBS and it eventually insured about40% of his non-core division. RBS was able to withdraw from the insurance scheme last year without needing to draw down the cover, and paid a fee to the taxpayer of \u00a32.5bn for the life-saving protection. Cullinan rejoined RBS from the Russian operation Renaissance after a period at the private equity firm Permira. His working career started as a retailer in Botswana, where his policeman father was posted in 1979, before he joined Citigroup, beginning a career in the financial world that involved moves to Barclays and Pembridge, a Bermuda-based investment vehicle associated with the late Sir James Goldsmith. &quot;I worked for Jimmy Goldsmith who was the original asset stripper. Even my father called me an asset stripper,&quot; said Cullinan. These days he prefers to describe himself as someone who knows &quot;how to create value&quot;. His team will soon be disbanded, something he says they knew when took on their jobs. &quot;To succeed you have to be unemployed, but hopefully not unemployable,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/05/champions-mile-dan-excel-penitent", "sentences": ["The Far Eastern spring circuit moves on in two weeks&apos; time to Singapore, where the clash between the seemingly omni-competent Red Cadeaux and APQEII winner Military Attack promises far more excitement than today&apos;s lacklustre event was able to provide."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-05T10:12:59Z", "title": "Dan Excel wins Champions Mile for trainer John Moore | Paul Haigh", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "There are good Group races in Hong Kong and outstanding ones. But it would be stretching the truth to claim that Sunday&apos;s Champions Mile at Sha Tin is doing much more at present than cling tenaciously to its International G1 status. Its grandiloquent title may suggest otherwise. But shorn of its sponsor, BMW; shorn of the presence of local champion Ambitious Dragon, who has retired for the season after clipping heels in last week&apos;s Audemars Piguet Queen Elizabeth II Stakes; and shorn of almost any sense of occasion by an uncharacteristically low-key presentation by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the Champions Mile promised little, and delivered. This will hardly depress John Moore, who maintained his stupendous record in home G1s by taking the race for the third time in succession and the fifth in all. Nor will there be any complaint from the veteran South African jockey Weichong Marwing, who drove the winner to a neck victory. But it does nothing much for the event&apos;s now surely precarious status that the victor was the consistently frame-making Dan Excel, a son of Shamardal who had previously won just once in 15 Hong Kong outings. On a day when nothing was coming from very far off the pace, the winner chased the frontrunning 70-1 shot Helene Spirit, and it was only in the last half furlong that Dan Excel began to wear down the game outsider. Short-priced favourite Glorious Days made a mid-straight bid before wilting inside the final furlong, and second favourite Packing Whiz kept on only well enough to snatch third. Even in such a moderate field, the British challenger Penitent, a first overseas runner for trainer David O&apos;Meara and ridden by Danny Tudhope, never looked likely to take any hand and finished seventh of the nine runners. He beat home only Pure Champion, who once raced for Ballydoyle as Steinbeck, and 10-times New Zealand G1 winner King Mufhasa, whose performance can be excused as he was found to have blood in his trachea and be lame behind. Say what you like about the 2013 Champions Mile, and no doubt a few will, but do not make the mistake of thinking that it contained any champions, or that it produced one.

The Save the Children mothers&apos; index, now in its 14th year, records not only the likelihood of death in pregnancy or labour but also the difficulties women face when they become mothers. The charity scores countries on maternal health, child mortality, education, women&apos;s income and women&apos;s political status. The top end of the table is dominated by European countries and Australia. The UK manages only 25th place, although it is ranked higher than the US at 30th. &quot;The 10 top-ranked countries, in general, are among the best countries in the world for mothers&apos; and children&apos;s health, educational, economic and political status,&quot; says the report. &quot;The 10 bottom-ranked countries \u2013 all from sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 are a reverse image of the top 10, performing poorly on all indicators. Conditions for mothers and their children in these countries are devastating.&quot; In the bottom 10 countries, which include Nigeria, Gambia and Somalia, one woman in 30 is likely to die of a pregnancy-related cause. In these countries, one child in seven dies under the age of five, compared with one in 345 in Finland. Children get between two and nine years of education at best, whereas in Finland they can expect 17. While the US scores well on the educational and economic status of women \u2013 10th on both in the world \u2013 it is way behind the high-scoring countries on maternal health (46th) and children&apos;s wellbeing (41st) and does badly on the political status of women (89th) \u2013 women hold only 18% of seats in Congress. Only five developed countries in the world \u2013 Albania, Latvia, Moldova, the Russian Federation and Ukraine \u2013 do worse than the US on maternal mortality. Women in the US face a one in 2,400 risk of dying of causes related to pregnancy or childbirth. &quot;A woman in the US is more than 10 times as likely as a woman in Estonia, Greece or Singapore to eventually die from a pregnancy-related cause,&quot; says the report. Mortality among under-fives is 7.5 per 1,000 births in the US. &quot;This is roughly on par with rates in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Qatar and Slovakia. At this rate, children in the US are three times as likely as children in Iceland to die before their 5th birthday,&quot; says the report. Save the Children International&apos;s chief executive, Jasmine Whitbread, said: &quot;By investing in mothers and children, nations are investing in their future prosperity. If women are educated, are represented politically, and have access to good-quality maternal and child care, then they and their children are much more likely to survive and thrive \u2013 and so are the societies they live in. Huge progress has been made across the developing world, but much more can be done to save and improve millions of the poorest mothers&apos; and newborns&apos; lives.&quot; For the first time, the charity has compiled a separate index on newborn deaths. While deaths of children under five around the world have come down substantially in recent years, there has been little progress on newborns. The riskiest day of a child&apos;s life is the day of its birth, says Save the Children: 1 million die on that day every year. The most dangerous place to be born, the index shows, is Somalia, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo; these are also the two most unfavourable countries for mothers. Babies in sub-Saharan Africa are more than seven times as likely to die on the day they are born than babies in industrialised countries; Luxembourg, Iceland and then Cyprus have the best safety records. The US has about 50% more deaths on the day of birth than all other industrialised countries combined, which the report says is partly due to the high numbers of premature births. Save the Children is pressing for interventions that would bring down the death toll in the developing world: injectable antibiotics to treat sepsis and pneumonia in newborns, corticosteroid injections for women in premature labour to help babies&apos; lung function at birth, resuscitation devices, and antiseptic to clean the umbilical cord and prevent fatal infections. It also calls for more skilled birth attendants and more effort to improve women&apos;s status, education and nutrition."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/07/queen-commonweath-summit-charles", "sentences": ["However, she did not attend the inaugural meeting in Singapore in 1971."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-07T11:49:28Z", "title": "Queen's absence from Commonwealth summit heralds new role for Charles", "tags": ["The Queen", "Commonwealth summit", "Prince Charles", "Monarchy", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "The Queen will not attend this year&apos;s Commonwealth heads of government meeting (Chogm) in Sri Lanka, Buckingham Palace has said, in a significant announcement auguring future changes to accommodate her age. The Prince of Wales will represent the 87-year-old monarch, who has not missed the biennial conference since 1973. It will be the first time the future king has stepped into this role. The move will be interpreted as preparing the way for him to become the next head of the Commonwealth, even though he has no automatic entitlement to the position. There had been calls by campaigners for the Queen to avoid the November summit in Colombo because of Sri Lanka&apos;s human rights record. The fact she has decided her eldest son should go in her place indicates this is not a political decision but a practical one. Palace officials are reviewing the amount of long-haul travel undertaken by the monarch and the Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 92 next month. A spokesman said: &quot;It is nothing to do with the political situation in Sri Lanka. The key point here is that the Queen will be represented, although she not there in person, by the Prince of Wales&quot;. The decision will not have been taken lightly. Apart from highlighting the Queen&apos;s age and arousing concern for her health, it will be seen as a symbolic moment in Charles&apos;s preparation for kingship and his assuming more of his mother&apos;s duties. The Queen&apos;s regards her role as head of the 54-nation voluntary association \u2013 she is Queen of 16 Commonwealth realms and their 137 million people \u2013 as one of the most important of her reign, although she has no formal powers. On opening the Commonwealth Institute building in west London in 1962, she said: &quot;I suppose that between us, my husband and I have seen more of the Commonwealth than almost any people alive.&quot; She has visited all but two Commonwealth countries: Cameroon, which joined in 1995, and Rwanda, which joined in 2009. Prince Philip has described her as the &quot;Commonwealth psychotherapist&quot; and she has built up unique relations with its leaders throughout her reign. As a young queen she grew up alongside leaders such as Zambia&apos;s Kenneth Kaunda, Tanzania&apos;s Julius Nyerere and Indira Gandhi of India. Her role means her relationship with the Commonwealth and its leaders is different to that of any British government. Many use Chogm as an opportunity to privately confide in her. She was first present at the 1973 Chogm in Ottawa, and has been at every summit since. However, she did not attend the inaugural meeting in Singapore in 1971. The then prime minister, Edward Heath, effectively prevented her from going because of member states&apos; attitudes to the question of Britain selling arms to South Africa. She is understood to have wanted to go, and regretted not going, but was bound by Heath&apos;s advice. In 2007, unusually, both Charles and the Queen attended Chogm in Uganda. Though he did not attend the opening ceremony, which was attended by the Queen, Charles supported her on the visit and his presence kindled debate on whether he would assume the Commonwealth mantle. It will be up to the countries&apos; heads of government to decide what they want to do with the symbolic post in the future. Opposition has been voiced to Charles inheriting the role. But, in the last few months, the Australian prime minister, Julia Gillard, seemed to support such a move. She said: &quot;For Australia&apos;s part, I am sure the Queen&apos;s successor as monarch will one day serve as head of Commonwealth with the same distinction as Her Majesty has done&quot;. The Commonwealth secretary general, Kamalesh Sharma, has also spoken of how Charles&apos;s support for the Commonwealth has deepened its links to the crown. Campaign groups including Amnesty International are calling for the Chogm meeting not to take place in Colombo before an investigation is carried out into human rights abuses in the final six months of the 26-year Sri Lankan civil war."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/07/david-cameron-times-ad-tory-voter", "sentences": ["He tells him he has failed to get to grips with the banking crisis and says he should try and find out what the banks in Germany, Singapore or Malaysia are &quot;so much more helpful&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-07T16:44:44Z", "title": "David Cameron blasted in full-page Times ad by 'disillusioned' Tory voter", "tags": ["The Times", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Advertising", "Media", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "An anonymous &quot;disillusioned&quot; Tory voter has splashed out an estimated \u00a316,000 for a full-page advert in the Times to beg David Cameron and George Osborne to learn about the &quot;unpleasant realities of the real world&quot;.

Second, it&apos;s the betrayed golden land enslaved by be-medalled generals who enrich themselves through drug deals and gun down unarmed protesters. Third, it is modern Myanmar, a deeply wounded and fractured multi-ethnic society that is working through \u2013 in a phrase favoured by optimistic citizens \u2013 its &quot;democratic transition&quot;. For the past two decades western writers and readers have focused their minds on the brutality and cronyism of the dictatorship.

Now the country&apos;s poets, authors and journalists are writing with unprecedented freedom: touching hearts, steeling courage, showing that life need never go back to the bad, old ways. 1. &apos;A Hanging&apos; by George Orwell No surprise that George Orwell, author of the two defining parables of the 20th century, should be top of the list, especially as his five years in Burma atuned him to the suffering of the oppressed. More moving than &apos;Burmese Days&apos; is his short story &quot;A Hanging&quot;, in which he watches a condemned criminal walk towards the gallows \u2026 and sidestep a puddle. In that fleeting moment, Orwell marks the preciousness of human life and the heartlessness of power. 2. The Burman: His Life and Notions by Sir George Scott Should a Sunday-born man marry a lady born on Wednesday? To bring luck, should a house be built on male, female or neuter foundation posts? George Scott served as frontier officer for three decades at the end of the 19th century, but his enduring legacy is as collector and sympathetic chronicler of the old ways in a country &quot;where people are small and ghosts are big&quot;. 3. The Glass Palace by Amitav Ghosh The finest novel written on the English in Burma. It is set during the British invasion of 1885, when a poor boy is lifted up on the tides of political and social chaos that shaped Burma and India. 4. Golden Earth: Travels in Burma by Norman Lewis Among the 20th century&apos;s finest travel writers, Norman Lewis visited Burma in the early 1950s. Golden Earth is a bittersweet portrait of the then-optimistic, now-lost land \u2013 before communist incursions and tribal insurrection shattered the dream. 5. From the Land of Green Ghosts by Pascal Khoo Thwe &quot;Nearly every night I dream of the Shan State, of Mandalay, of the jungle. The landscapes of my dreams resemble real ones, yet they shift like images on silver screens \u2026&quot; Pascal Khoo Thwe&apos;s mesmerising biography stretches from his grandmother&apos;s creation stories to civil war and a chance conversation about James Joyce that leads to a new life in Britain. A minor masterpiece. 6. Burmese Chronicles by Guy Delisle How can a comic book convey the cruelty, injustice and absurdity of the SLORC years? Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Guy Delisle&apos;s enlightening and insightful graphic travelogue succeeds by disarming the reader, as we learn with him the truth about the struggle for survival under the generals. 7. Freedom from Fear and Other Writings by Aung San Suu Kyi Few women in public life have suffered more for their beliefs than Aung San Suu Kyi, and inspired so many people by their example. &quot;Concepts such as truth, justice, compassion are often the only bulwarks which stand against ruthless power,&quot; she once wrote. Like the country itself, she too is working through a &quot;democratic transition&quot;, from prisoner to parliamentarian, to (probably) president in 2015. In this collection of writings, which includes her Nobel peace prize speech, she shares the vision, hopes, principles and humanity that have sustained and continue to sustain her. 8. The River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burma by Thant Myint-U For 200 years, Thant Myint-U&apos;s forefathers served Burma&apos;s royalty. His grandfather rose to become UN secretary-general. This remarkable family story is woven into Burma&apos;s history in a work that is moving, lyrical, shocking \u2013 and essential for anyone wishing to understand the country emerging today. 9. Zargana Zargana hasn&apos;t written a book \u2013 yet. The most popular comedian and satirist in Myanmar, Zargana (whose name translates as &quot;tweezers&quot;) picked at the junta with his wicked puns for more than 20 years, many of which were spent in prison. His courageous performances bridged the gap between the three Burmas, not least in reviving the popularity of anyeint, the traditional vaudeville-like theatre. 10. Bones Will Crow: 15 Contemporary Burmese Poets, edited by ko ko thett and James Byrne &quot;Poetry is not by the language, not via the language from the language, not\u00a0with the language without the language.

Premier Li Keqiang told the Israeli leader he anticipated exchanging views on regional issues such as the peace process as well as bilateral co-operation, as they met in the Great Hall of the People. Li and Chinese president Xi Jinping met Mahmoud Abbas two days earlier, while Netanyahu was in Shanghai. The unusual overlapping visits prompted speculation about China&apos;s possible role as a mediator, particularly after the Foreign Ministry expressed willingness to arrange a meeting if the two men wished. State media also heralded Chinese president Xi Jinping&apos;s announcement of a four-point peace plan. &quot;It is not the first time China has made efforts on this issue, but it is the first time our leader clearly set out four proposals on this in public,&quot; said Li Guofu, director of the Middle East Studies Centre at the China Institutes of International Studies. But Abbas left Beijing before Netanyahu arrived in the capital. Israeli officials had already briefed that the two men would not meet, and have focused on the commercial aspect of the trip. And the contents of Xi&apos;s plan are familiar from previous Chinese statements. &quot;My impression is that this is a giant exercise in intentional ambiguity by all parties. It&apos;s very well-choreographed and quite vacuous in terms of substantial results,&quot; said Robert Bianchi, visiting research professor at the National University of Singapore and an expert on China and the Middle East. &quot;The story is bigger than the day \u2026 It&apos;s more about China and its larger diplomatic weight, particularly in the Middle East and Islamic world.&quot; Yin Gang, one of the country&apos;s best-known Middle East experts, even suggested the twin visits were a coincidence: the Israelis had called off two previous trips and this is the height of China&apos;s diplomatic season, he noted. &quot;China is not the key mediator. China plays an assisting role,&quot; he added. Beijing&apos;s trade with the Middle East \u2013 and especially its thirst for oil \u2013 has expanded substantially in recent years and increased its desire for stability there. &quot;China has for a long time firmly supported Palestine \u2026 The Palestinian people trust China. [But] China also maintains a friendly relationship with Israel,&quot; said Li Guofu. Its economic links with Israel are burgeoning; bilateral trade has grown to around $8bn annually. China has become a prime customer for Israeli technology, pointed out Bianchi, and Li and Netanyahu signed fresh deals on Wednesday. The bigger picture, Bianchi noted, is that &quot;there&apos;s a lot of horsetrading between Washington and Beijing over Middle East and Asian issues \u2026 As China sees the effectiveness of that it has a greater incentive to be more omnipresent in the Middle East \u2013 especially as the US starts to sniff around China&apos;s sphere of influence in the Western Pacific. China is starting to return the favour.&quot; Its expression of keenness to help resolve the conflict, he added, is also &quot;a very clear refutation of the notion it doesn&apos;t have diplomacy or responsibility and is a free-rider not interested in being a &apos;good world citizen&apos;.&quot; Shi Yinhong, a foreign relations scholar at Renmin University, suggested the dual visits could be the beginning of a &quot;much more prominent role&quot; for China on the issue. He said Beijing might also be looking for positive ways of working with Washington, which has been seeking to revive the peace process, at a time of strained bilateral relations. US secretary of state, John Kerry, said on Wednesday that he would be returning to the Middle East in two weeks time for further talks. Other analysts believe that Beijing will be reluctant to become too deeply embroiled in the conflict. Kerry Brown of the University of Sydney said: &quot;I guess [this week] gives them good political capital with America and it isn&apos;t a big risk for them. It&apos;s a relatively easy good news story for China \u2013 but I can&apos;t see any reason for it to get too involved.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/08/standard-chartered-executives-reelection", "sentences": ["It was not immediately clear which investors had abstained, but last year Singapore investor Temasek, which owns 18% of the Asia-focused bank, abstained from voting to re-elect some directors to register its disapproval at the way the bank organised its board.", "The bank said it was hit by weak performance in Korea, Singapore and rising staff costs."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-08T18:00:22Z", "title": "Standard Chartered shareholders show disapproval of four executives", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Shareholders have issued a rebuke to four Standard Chartered executives on the day the UK-based bank reported a rare drop in profits.

George Osborne, the chancellor, warned the alleged tax evaders, and a further 200 accountants and advisers accused of helping them cheat the taxman: &quot;The message is simple: if you evade tax, we&apos;re coming after you.&quot; HM Revenue &amp; Customs warned those involved, who were named in offshore data first offered to the authorities by a whistleblower in 2009, that they will face &quot;criminal prosecution or significant penalties&quot; if they do not voluntarily disclose their tax irregularities, as the UK steps up its efforts to clamp down on avoidance ahead of the G8 summit in June. The 400-gigabyte cache of data leaked to the authorities is understood to be the same information seen by the Guardian in its Offshore Secrets series in November 2012 and March this year. It reveals complicated financial structures using companies and trusts stretching from Singapore and the British Virgin Islands to the Cayman Islands and the Cook Islands. The Treasury is working in collaboration with American and Australian tax authorities in the biggest ever cross-border tax evasion investigation, and warned that the alleged evaders may be publicly named and shamed if they fail to come clean and explain their tax affairs. Osborne described the data as &quot;another weapon in HMRC&apos;s arsenal&quot; in the fight against global tax evasion. HMRC added it &quot;reveals extensive use of complex offshore structures to conceal assets by wealthy individuals and companies&quot;. The Revenue said it was continuing to analyse the material, the equivalent of more than 200 lorry-loads of printed A4 sheets, but it has already &quot;identified over 100 people who benefit from these structures&quot;. A number of those &quot;had already been identified and are under investigation for offshore tax evasion&quot;. It urged those who use offshore tax structures to urgently review their taxation arrangements to ensure they comply with the law, and encouraged those that don&apos;t to ensure &quot;early disclosure of tax irregularities. Failure to do so may result in a criminal prosecution or significant financial penalties and the possibility of their identities being published,&quot; HMRC warned. It is also investigating more than 200 UK accountants, lawyers and other professional advisers named in the data as advising the wealthy on setting up the elaborate offshore tax arrangements. HMRC declined to name any of the individuals, advisers or companies it is investigating. An HMRC source said it was first offered a &quot;taster&quot; of the cache in 2009, but received the bulk in late 2010. A spokesman declined to state if it paid a reward to the whistleblower. The Guardian, BBC Panorama and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) have been releasing details of UK citizens and companies acting as offshore middlemen. Gerard Ryle, director of the ICIJ, said he expected the collaboration between taxmen in the UK, US and Australia to lead to &quot;the largest tax investigation in history&quot;. He added: &quot;We know from the data we obtained there are names of people from more than 170 countries. Some are prominent citizens \u2013 politicians, celebrities, businessmen, the elite of some societies. &quot;To have three major tax agencies collaborating \u2013 with the possibility of many more doing the same \u2013 is potentially a major blow to the secrecy of offshore jurisdictions.&quot; Among those identified by ICIJ data in the joint investigation was James Turner of York-based company formation agents Turner Little, who told undercover reporters how to set up a foundation in Belize: &quot;It doesn&apos;t link back to you, it doesn&apos;t link back to your family. So it gives you complete confidentiality.&quot; A representative of Atlas Corporate Services, another company run by Britons but operating from Mauritius, explained to reporters how to avoid tax on a hypothetical \u00a36m sitting in a Swiss bank account. He suggested, &quot;off the record&quot;, that they use an offshore entity in Panama. &quot;If there&apos;s a tax issue \u2026 they won&apos;t disclose any information on that foundation under Panamanian law,&quot; he said. Another middleman, Russell Lebe of Readymade Companies Worldwide, advising a reporter posing as an Indian businessman, assured his client that &quot;If we were approached by the Indian tax authority \u2026 and they&apos;re doing tax evasion, we wouldn&apos;t give a monkey&apos;s.&quot; The Guardian, in its investigation, identified 28 individuals with ties to the UK acting as &quot;sham&quot; directors for more than 21,000 companies across the world, keeping the true owners of the companies off official paperwork and thus making them invisible to authorities. However, there is no suggestion that any of the individuals identified in the Guardian/ICIJ investigation are among those being examined by HMRC. Jenny Granger, HMRC&apos;s director general for enforcement and compliance, cautioned that not all the individuals using offshore accounts were seeking to evade tax. &quot;There is nothing illegal about an international structure, especially in a globally integrated economy and these arrangements may be perfectly legitimate and may have already been declared to HMRC,&quot; she said. &quot;However, they may involve tax evasion, avoidance or other serious offences by taxpayers. What has got to stop is using offshore structures to illegally hide assets and income.&quot; David Cameron has pledged to make tackling the &quot;staggering&quot; levels of tax evasion a key priority of the UK&apos;s presidency of the G8 this year. The EU will hold a summit on tax evasion on 22 May. It will be followed by a G8 summit under British chairmanship in June."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/may/10/simon-hoggart-week-melanie-phillips", "sentences": ["She was just back from Australia, and off to Singapore the next day; these top musicians lead relentlessly restless lives."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-10T18:02:52Z", "title": "Simon Hoggart's week: would you buy a poncho from a Guardian columnist?", "tags": ["Melanie Phillips", "Media", "Helen Mirren", "Film", "Stage", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Broadband", "Technology"], "article": "\u2712 When I saw that my old chum Melanie Phillips \u2013 once a Guardian lefty, now a rightwing columnist on the Daily Mail \u2013 was bringing out her own brand of merchandise, I assumed it was a joke. I was wrong. You can now buy tote bags, T-shirts, Kindle and iPhone covers, and baseball caps with Melanie&apos;s company logo. I bet da kidz will buy zillions. What could be cooler than chilling with your homies, decked out in Melanie branded goods? Two thoughts occurred to me. First, we Guardian columnists ought to have a line of collectibles fit for soggy liberals. A poncho to stop us being dripping wet, reversible so we can have it both ways. A cap marked &quot;I\u00a0\u2764\u00a0all forms of diversity&quot;. Gloves, the left embroidered &quot;On the one hand&quot; and the right, &quot;on the other&quot;. The other thing that puzzles me is this. When people move from one extreme set of views to embrace another equally batty picture of the world, they expect us to applaud their choice, as if the fact that they have rejected one form of nuttiness somehow validates the screwball views they hold now. It&apos;s as if a Millwall hooligan were to switch to West Ham and imagine that any of us cared. Still, the Melanie mugs are nice, as they should be at \u00a314.50. \u2712 I finally caught the Pompeii and Herculaneum exhibition at the British Museum this week. It&apos;s brilliantly done. What you get, which you don&apos;t from the dullish displays of single pots, amulets, etc, in the rest of the museum, is a real sense of what life was like if you lived in those places. And the explanations are sometimes quite harsh: people were vulgar, and they wanted their neighbours to know how rich they were. So little changes. &quot;Do we have to go to the Noniuses for lunch? They always serve an entire octopus, &apos;so much cheaper if you buy it whole, and Ofillius the fish-seller is such a darling, he guts it for us.

I can&apos;t wait to see the expression on Livia&apos;s face \u2026&quot; It is a remarkably vivid exhibition, and it&apos;s already hard to get tickets. \u2712 I was sorry to see that Dame Helen Mirren had made it up with the troupe of drummers who were drowning out her performance as the Queen by making an infernal racket outside the theatre. They were demonstrating for gay and transsexual rights. I had hoped she would continue to swear at them, shrieking and raging like a demented witch. Why should people make life insufferable for others, just because they believe their cause is right? Do they imagine that the rest of us will say: &quot;Hmmm, those people must have a pretty good case, or else they wouldn&apos;t be carrying on in this aggressive and boorish manner!&quot; I&apos;d prefer to see them pursued everywhere by our greatest female actors, Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Brenda Blethyn, all shouting the F-word at the top of their voices. \u2712 We went to Malmesbury, Wiltshire, at the weekend for a Music in Country Churches concert. MICC is a charity which helps preserve old churches. Malmesbury Abbey dates from the 7th century and you can&apos;t imagine a more stunning setting. Prince Charles is a patron and he sat on the front row on what looked like a folding chair with padding but wooden screws, as if Ikea made thrones, no doubt christened Oskar or Hampus. The players all seemed to be having a wonderful time. Two of the strings were flirting madly with each other, as were a pair of the woodwinds. They know who they are. The wonderful violin soloist, 25-year-old Chloe Hanslip from Guildford, also seemed to be flirting with all of them. No wonder it&apos;s called the London Chamber Orchestra. At the end of her stint she bowed, very low, several times right in front of the prince, giving the whole event a Regency feel, formal yet risqu\u00e9. Later we chatted to her and she was charming. She was just back from Australia, and off to Singapore the next day; these top musicians lead relentlessly restless lives. The concert was sponsored by Pol Roger champagne, and I got to chat to Patrice Noyelle, the outgoing boss. He collects stories about his wine&apos;s role in historic events. For example, in what was then Salisbury, Rhodesia, the temporary governor was Christopher Soames, Churchill&apos;s son-in-law. He had flown out quantities of good wine to lubricate discussions. But one lot of talks was going badly. &quot;Oh, I know we&apos;ll finish in a couple of days,&quot; he told a well-wisher airily. &quot;You see there are only two bottles of Pol Roger left in my cellar.&quot; And if you are in Malmesbury, look in at the Abbey House gardens which are superlative, and at the moment feature a pulse-stopping display of thousands of tulips, in almost unbelievable colours. \u2712 We may have found the title for our Peter Alliss symposium, to be held later this year. Nick Greenwood reminds me of my all-time favourite quote from Sir Peter. (I have bestowed the knighthood). It concerned the golfer Chris DiMarco, whose mother had died shortly before the tournament. He was playing well, and in that uniquely religiose American way he attributed this to his mother, who was watching from heaven and urging him on. Then he missed a crucial putt. &quot;Ooh,&quot; said Sir Peter, &quot;Mom must have just popped out for a cup of tea.&quot; Sheer genius, and &quot;Just Popped Out&quot; could be the title of our gathering. \u2712 More unhelpful advice: Jonathan Harris&apos;s BT broadband went down so he rang the BT helpline, where he was advised to get more information \u2013 by going online.

Mozambique and Tanzania are emerging as major exporters of natural gas; Guinea and Sierra Leone have iron ore; while in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, cobalt mining is booming. Strong demand will drive another decade of high prices for Africa&apos;s natural resources. Foreign investment is on the rise. But so too are avarice and corruption, on such a scale that instead of enjoying significant investment in healthcare, education and agriculture, Africa is again being plundered. That is the view of the annual Africa Progress Report, published last week, produced by a panel of luminaries led by the former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. Large-scale tax avoidance and evasion, financial transfers, offshore registered companies and secret mining deals cost Africa \u00a325bn a year, twice as much as it receives in aid. &quot;These are global problems that demand multilateral solutions,&quot; Annan said last week. The G7 leaders&apos; meeting in Britain yesterday voiced their determination to combat tax avoidance. David Cameron has made tax and transparency key subjects for next month&apos;s G8 meeting at Lough Erne, Northern Ireland. George Osborne yesterday emphasised how central the issue is to government strategy and, as we report, will pursue his tax-reforming strategy at a meeting of EU finance ministers later this week. This is admirable, but a glimpse at the Africa Progress Report shows how much work there is to do. And not just in tightening up international legislation, but also in effecting a cultural change in the way the leading firms conduct their business. The scale of greed, the absence of conscience and the stupidity of not investing in the creation of stable future markets in Africa are laid bare in the report. Take the example of the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The FTSE 100 mining company is heavily criticised for &quot;opaque concession trading&quot;. Five mining stakes bought by the company in 2010-2012 were state assets allegedly sold at far less than their true value. The cost in lost revenues to the DRC is calculated at $1.3bn \u2013 equivalent to its health and education budgets combined. Multiple offshore vehicles were deployed to conceal the secretive deals, precisely the sort of lack of transparency that the G8 is committed to tackling. The Annan report also highlights how, in the four years to 2009, half-a-million copper mine workers in Zambia paid a higher rate of tax than the major multinational mining firms that were harvesting billions of dollars in profits. How can this be right? And why has such behaviour become acceptable? The examples are everywhere. In 2011, Google paid just \u00a36m in corporation tax on revenues of \u00a32.5bn in the UK. Its chairman rightly said that they &quot;comply with the law&quot;. The problem is that our law has not found a way of adequately taxing companies such as Google. In the meantime, such firms use every conceivable mechanism to avoid paying tax. They then offer a risible justification, such as Schmidt did when he said that Google employs 2,000 people in Britain. Not good enough. Google employs people \u2013 try making money without doing that \u2014 and makes billions in the process, but puts practically nothing back into the country from which it harvests \u00a32.5bn annually. Nothing to help finance the education of the next 2,000 employees from this country. Nothing to help maintain the physical infrastructure of a country where it does business. Nothing to help subsidise the cultural riches that make this country an attractive place to live and work. Nothing to help pay for the judicial, legal and police institutions that make the country a safe and civil place to do business. We as a society \u2013 and that includes business behemoths such as Google \u2013 have responsibilities to deal fairly with communities with whom we trade. The pioneers of benevolent capitalism recognised their obligations to help build a decent society from which they profited. But Google is not alone. Last week, it was announced that more than half of Britain&apos;s wealthiest people were hiding billions of pounds in offshore havens to evade tax, helped by 200 accountants and advisers. Tax evasion is illegal but tax avoidance, finding legitimate loopholes to avoid paying a fair tithe as a citizen, is rampant. Last year, a Tax Justice Network (TJN) report revealed that the global super-rich have hidden \u00a313tn of wealth offshore. Illumination about the true state of the UK&apos;s financial affairs has been helped by the work of the public accounts committee, chaired by Margaret Hodge, an invaluable fiscal watchdog. Last month, it castigated the four large accountancy firms, Deloitte, Ernst and Young, KPMG and PwC, which earned $25bn from advising on tax avoidance. In the 1960s, accountants deemed avoidance an undignified practice, acknowledging that tax is a collective obligation to build a decent society. Now it is a lucrative business \u2013 finding new ways to short-change the chancellor and rip off developing countries. Amazon in the US lobbied effectively for 20 years to avoid paying the sales tax levied on &quot;bricks and mortar&quot; retailers it competes with and increasingly puts out of business. Jacob Weisberg, writing in the Financial Times, pointed out that we have &quot;a political system so compromised and sclerotic that it cannot correct even the most straightforward economic unfairness in a timely fashion&quot;. The average taxpayer can only rage. But what is to be done? Globally, changes are under way. From July, for instance, in Singapore, laundering profits earned from tax evasion will be a crime, while Luxembourg ends its bank secrecy policy in 2105. More is required. The international tax system is a century old and needs radical redesign, not repair. TJN proposes a unitary tax system of transnational corporations, &quot;to tax them according to where their genuine economic activity is, rather than where their tax advisers pretend it is&quot;. The US Dodd-Frank Act that requires full disclosure of payments by resource-extraction companies to foreign governments needs to be built on \u2013 and comparable EU legislation is required. At home, HMRC requires more, not fewer, resources. Serious questions too need to be asked of George Osborne&apos;s decisions at the last budget that appear to make it even easier for companies to shift their profit into tax haven subsidiaries. Tax havens should end. Political will, co-ordinated international action, more public education and tax systems that work for all might give Africa a fresh beginning. We also need to create a new moral consensus that says those companies and individuals who pocket obscene amounts of wealth without paying their civic dues should be denied our custom and treated instead as the freeloading pariahs they are."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/12/bordeaux-wine-vineyards-christies-chinese", "sentences": ["This month, in a symbolic move, the Regional Council of Burgundy moved its only marketing office in Asia from Singapore to Hong Kong, reflecting its desire to target Chinese demand."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-11T23:06:30Z", "title": "Chinese move on from snapping up fine wines, to buying the whole vineyards", "tags": ["Wine", "Life and style", "France", "Wine holidays", "Food & drink", "Food and drink", "Travel", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Bordeaux holidays", "France holidays", "Europe holidays", "Europe"], "article": "As a reflection of shifting economic fortunes, it takes some beating. Christie&apos;s auction house is opening the world&apos;s first estate agency for wealthy Chinese people who don&apos;t merely want to buy the finest vintages by the bottle, they want to own their own vineyards. Vineyards by Christie&apos;s International Real Estate \u2013 the &quot;first global advisory for buyers of vineyard estates&quot; \u2013 is opening in Hong Kong, staffed by fine wine experts and property specialists to offer &quot;a discreet consultative service for clients looking to acquire vineyards in the world&apos;s most sought-after wine regions&quot;. The auction house explained that the move was &quot;conceived to meet demand from clients at Christie&apos;s wine auctions in Hong Kong requesting expert advice in purchasing overseas vineyard properties&quot;. The Chinese have developed a taste for the finest French wines and their extensive buying power has been credited with pushing prices for certain vintages to record levels. Last year, Christie&apos;s sold more than \u00a323m worth of wine at nine sales in Hong Kong. A single jeroboam of 1999 Roman\u00e9e-Conti burgundy sold for more than \u00a347,000 at auction. In March, a Hong Kong auction house sold three double magnums of 1990 P\u00e9trus, a bordeaux, for a record price of \u00a349,500, while a single bottle of 1947 P\u00e9trus set another record at \u00a39,900. China is now the fourth largest export market for burgundy behind Japan, Britain and the US. This month, in a symbolic move, the Regional Council of Burgundy moved its only marketing office in Asia from Singapore to Hong Kong, reflecting its desire to target Chinese demand. Burgundy&apos;s attraction to Chinese investors is also reflected in visitor numbers with the number of Chinese staying at least one night in the province almost doubling from 38,000 in 2010 to more than 70,000 in 2011. Meanwhile, China&apos;s enthusiasm for bordeaux has contributed to what some believe is a bubble in the fine wine&apos;s market. More recently, demand from affluent Chinese investors has extended to buying up vineyards which often come with a chateau attached. Safer, (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d&apos;Am\u00e9nagement Foncier et d&apos;Etablissement Rural), the body that monitors vineyard sales in France, said that of the 35 chateaux with vineyards sold in Bordeaux in 2011, 21 went to Chinese buyers. Of the 37 vineyard-chateaux sold last year, 23 went to the Chinese. &quot;The Chinese are snapping up Bordeaux properties at higher and higher prices,&quot; said Adam Lechmere, news editor at Decanter.com. &quot;It&apos;s a perfectly logical thing for the Chinese to do. They value provenance above everything else. A common scenario sees them buy up the vineyard and take over everything from production to sales.&quot; However, Michael Baynes, a vineyard property specialist who works for Christie&apos;s Bordeaux affiliate, Maxwell-Storrie Baynes, said:&quot;It is essential that buyers work with experts who know the industry, operate in the local market, are well connected with local vineyard owners and are immersed in a region&apos;s wine industry network. &quot;Vineyard markets in sought-after locations are often small and discreet, and without expert guidance, buyers may never even know they are on the market. It is not uncommon for more than half of our vineyards to be privately listed \u2013 never advertised and never placed on websites.&quot; However, some experts believe the rush among Chinese investors to buy into La Belle Vie may be mistimed because there are signs that Chinese demand for French wines may have peaked. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, comprising 10 vintages of leading wines, declined 9.7% last year after a 17% drop in 2011. Much of the decline was attributed to falling demand from Chinese investors who began baulking at prices after realising that they had overpaid in previous years. A bellwether premium cru, Chateau Lafite, was selling at auction for about \u00a314,600 a case in November 2011. Now it is going for \u00a37,300 a case, largely as a result of softening Chinese demand. China&apos;s spending spree has not been without controversy.

Aamer, a British resident, has been held at the controversial detention camp for 11 years, despite never having been tried or charged with any crime. He has been cleared for release on two separate occasions, but remains behind bars as the last Briton at the camp. The issue of his continued incarceration has seemingly become a sore point between the UK and US governments. The British government maintains it is committed to getting Aamer out of Guant\u00e1namo. Over the last two weeks, foreign secretary William Hague and defence secretary Philip Hammond have lobbied their US counterparts \u2013 secretary of state John Kerry and defense secretary Chuck Hagel \u2013 over Aamer, a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. But the official UK line has seemingly been undermined by the Pentagon, with officials reportedly briefing that Britain&apos;s commitment to the detainee&apos;s release is half-hearted. The senior senator from New Mexico, Tom Udall, enquired into the status of Aamer after being lobbied by his supporters. What he was told by an official at the Department of Defense&apos;s legislative affairs division differs substantially from the long-held British line that UK officials are focused on Aamer&apos;s release. An email seen by the Guardian from Udall&apos;s chief of staff, Michael Collins, to advocacy group Code Pink&apos;s founder Medea Benjamin suggests that UK commitment is less than full-throttled. Collins states: &quot;We were told that the UK is not exactly in a rush to get him and Saudi Arabia [the place of Aamer&apos;s birth] \u2026 isn&apos;t interested either.&quot;. Speaking to the Guardian over the weekend, Hammond vehemently denied that interpretation of British efforts. In regards to the &quot;no rush&quot; claim, the minister said: &quot;That is not the position of the UK government. Every time I meet with my US counterpart I always raise the case of Shaker Aamer and I will do so again when I meet him in Singapore [for the Shangri-La Dialogue security conference] and at the upcoming Nato meeting.&quot; Aamer&apos;s lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that claims of a lack of urgency in seeking his client&apos;s release were &quot;very worrying&quot;. On Friday, he wrote to Hague, urging him to issue a &quot;suitably robust response&quot; to the US over the allegation that the British government was not &quot;in a rush&quot; to see the last remaining Briton being held in Guant\u00e1namo Bay released. &quot;We need to be &apos;in a rush to get him&apos;, as Shaker Aamer is being horribly abused even as I write this, after 11 years of prior mistreatment,&quot; Stafford Smith wrote. Aamer, 44, is one of 100 detainees currently on hunger strike at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Last month, the inmate talked of his fears of dying in the camp. At that stage \u2013 some 60 days into his strike, he said he had lost nearly a quarter of his body weight. Aamer wrote: &quot;I barely notice all of my medical ailments any more \u2013 the back pain from the beatings I have taken, the rheumatism from the frigid air conditioning, the asthma exacerbated by the toxic sprays they use to abuse us. There is an endless list. And now, 24/7 (as the Americans say), I have the ache of hunger.&quot; He added: &quot;I hope I do not die in this awful place. I want to hug my children and watch them grow. But if it is God&apos;s will that I should die here, I want to die with dignity. I hope, if the worst comes to the worst, that my children will understand that I care for the rights of those suffering around me almost as much as I care for them.&quot; Of the 100 hunger-striking detainees, 29 are being force fed; five need hospital assistance. In a further worrying development, lawyers reported over the weekend that detainees are now being subjected to humiliating body cavity searches if they want to see their lawyers. &quot;Under the new search policy, a detainee who leaves his camp is subject to a search including his private parts and holding his private parts,&quot; lawyer David Remes told the AFP news agency. He added that the move was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; designed to deter inmates from meeting their legal representatives and &quot;another tool to break the hunger strike&quot;. The latest hunger strike protest is now in its fourth month, with some prisoners having refused food since 6 February. The strike has led to renewed calls for Guantan\u00e1mo Bay to be shut. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama again signalled his intention to close the camp. But a similar pledge delivered just days after he took office in 2009 led nowhere, with Congress blocking the move. Wrangling over Aamer continues.  According to the briefing Senator Udall recieved from the US Department of Defence, there appears little chance of a early release date. Collins&apos; email states &quot;Also according to (the Department of Defense legislative affairs), he&apos;s not on the top of the release list, but is one of 56 detainees approved for transfer &apos;subject to appropriate security assurances&apos; and that there is no plan for immediate transfer.&quot; A possible sticking point could be that the US does not believe the UK will adhere to strict security conditions that would be a condition of release. A Pentagon spokesman, Lt Col Todd Breasseale, told the Guardian: &quot;Certain conditions must be met, and those detainees who may be resettled of repatriated must do so into nations where all necessary security assurances (to include concerns regarding recidivism) may be met.&quot; He added that host nations would be aware of what the stipulated conditions of release were. Hammond acknowledged that what was being demanded by the US over Aamer was &quot;a high test&quot;. But Stafford Smith dismissed any concerns in regards to security assurances, noting that the UK has the best record in respect to the release of Gunat\u00e1namo Bay prisoners. Furthermore, Aamer has agreed to enter any reasonable security arrangement on his release. In his letter to Hague, Stafford Smith wrote: &quot;Shaker Aamer never committed a crime in the first place, so there is no reason to believe that he would do that now; all he wants is to be returned to his wife and children.&quot;     A US military guard stands at Camp Delta detention compound in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, in 2006. Photograph: Brennan Linsley/AP    Aamer was taken to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in 2002. He had been picked up by the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan in late 2001, and handed over to the Americans. According to leaked files, the US believes the British resident met Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and led a unit of fighters against Nato troops. They also allege an association with the shoe bomber Richard Reid and the convicted 9/11 plotter Zacarias Moussaoui. Aamer&apos;s supporters claim he suffered terrible abuse at Bagram air base and that an alleged confession he made to captors was obtained under the pain of torture. It has been suggested that British secret service agents were present while Aamer was tortured by US interrogators, who repeatedly smashed his head against a wall, prior to his transportation to Guant\u00e1namo. It has also been suggested that Aamer&apos;s allegation of British complicity in his torture has led to a the British secret service actively lobbying against his release. Hammond categorically denied that to be the case. &quot;The only place I have heard that is in your newspaper,&quot; he told the Guardian, adding: &quot;I&apos;m not aware of any issue being raised by the secret services.&quot; The Foreign Office, which is leading official lobbying efforts by the UK government said it would continue to press for Aamer&apos;s release, also denying claims that it was in &quot;no rush&quot; to get him back. A spokeswoman told the Guardian: &quot;We have been lobbying for a long-time [over Shaker Aamer]. She added: &quot;We have been speaking to the US at the highest level and will continue to do so.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2013/may/12/media-monkey-bbc4-deborah-turness", "sentences": ["\u2712For Leveson watchers, Turness&apos;s job adds to the lineup of inquiry insiders who&apos;ve been drawn to fly overseas: Lord Justice Leveson himself kept mum in the UK once his report appeared but his tongue was loosened in Australia; inquiry counsel Robert Jay QC did a lap of honour in Singapore; the &quot;Loverson&quot; pair of lawyers preferred Santorini; and now John Toker, spinner to the inquiry and Turness&apos;s husband, is expected to join her in New York."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-12T18:00:00Z", "title": "Media Monkey: BBC4 job to shrink; NBC taps Turness", "tags": ["BBC4", "BBC", "Sky Living", "Sky plc", "NBC", "Television industry", "Daily Mail", "National newspapers", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "article": "\u2712Now Richard Klein has quit BBC4, the word at rodent-plagued New Broadcasting House is that the brainy channel won&apos;t be run in future by another full-blown controller; instead it seems BBC2 boss Janice Hadlow, Klein&apos;s predecessor and now BBC4&apos;s &quot;interim&quot; controller, could oversee it, with a dedicated junior post for a channel editor or channel executive. Radios 1 and 2 already have similar set-ups, for 1Xtra and 6 Music respectively; and if Zai Bennett becomes BBC1 controller in succession to (his predecessor at BBC3) Danny Cohen, as many expect, it will be a natural step for him, like Hadlow, to oversee both his new domain and his former one. \u2712Hadlow&apos;s recently announced filling-in role adds to the number of national institutions now being run by &quot;acting interim&quot; supremos: BBC1, BBC4, Newsnight, the Times, the Sunday Times, Chelsea FC. If you happen to be a broadsheet-reading, soap- or Danish drama-loving, Stamford Bridge season-ticket-holding news junkie, much of your life is currently shaped by these temps. \u2712With Lord Hall&apos;s top team at the BBC now complete, speculation centres on which TV series Tony&apos;s blokes most resemble \u2013 but the divide between generations makes sticking to one show alone impossible. On the one hand, there&apos;s the old 90s crowd (Hall himself, editorial director Roger Mosey, creative director and apparent confidant Alan Yentob, possibly cock o&apos; the north Peter Salmon), already being compared to the retreads in New Tricks; on the other, the young gang (James Purnell, Danny Cohen, Tim Davie, James Harding) with obvious affinities, individually and collectively, with The Inbetweeners. Women are in as short supply in the Hall team as in both shows, and to disguise this in the drama combining them the role of Helen Boaden may need to be split into two, played by Amanda Redman and Laura Haddock. \u2712The appointment of ITN&apos;s Deborah Turness to run NBC&apos;s news division confirms the form (as horseracing fans would say) of the position of advisory chair of the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival, a role in which Turness shone in 2010. That it&apos;s a springboard to great things is shown by her illustrious predecessors, including Mark Thompson, Dawn Airey and Peter Barron \u2013 so put money on future glory for 2012 chair Kenton Allen and 2013&apos;s Karl Warner. Sticklers may pedantically object that the roll of honour also includes George Entwistle; but the job is a predictor of a career on the rise (this was in 2011, before he briefly became BBC director general), without indicating whether someone will actually be any good once GEITF has propelled them upwards. \u2712For Leveson watchers, Turness&apos;s job adds to the lineup of inquiry insiders who&apos;ve been drawn to fly overseas: Lord Justice Leveson himself kept mum in the UK once his report appeared but his tongue was loosened in Australia; inquiry counsel Robert Jay QC did a lap of honour in Singapore; the &quot;Loverson&quot; pair of lawyers preferred Santorini; and now John Toker, spinner to the inquiry and Turness&apos;s husband, is expected to join her in New York. \u2712If one character seems strangely familiar in Sky Living&apos;s episode of Hannibal (a prequel to The Silence of the Lambs) tomorrow, it&apos;s because that&apos;s the idea: Freddy Lounds, a trashy tabloid hack with corkscrew red hair, is meant to resemble Rebekah Brooks, the show&apos;s creator Bryan Fuller has eagerly pointed out. Just how bad a person Freddy is has yet to emerge, but there will be a certain pleasure among toilers at BSkyB as its series pours more vitriol on a barely disguised version of the woman who, until the phone-hacking scandal intervened, ran the other arm of Rupert Murdoch&apos;s UK empire. \u2712The launch of Melanie Phillips Unbound, the Mail columnist&apos;s alarmingly-named publishing venture, was attended on Wednesday by pillars of the right who seemed receptive to her liberating message, though whether the likes of Simon Heffer and the acting editors of the Times and Sunday Times will be wearing the slogan-sporting t-shirts (&quot;THINK the unthinkable. SAY the unsayable. DO the undoable&quot;) in their goody bags must be doubtful. Monkey will, but spent the event puzzling over the teasing revelation at the outset that Coldplay were among Mel P&apos;s inspirations. What could possibly link the hammer of the left to Chris Martin&apos;s pinko combo? Luckily, it later emerged that her policy of offering some content (including the first ebook) free online mimicked Coldplay&apos;s example with their 2009 album LeftRightLeftRightLeft. Readers who can remember her as a Guardian writer may like to come up with a similar alternative name for Melanie Phillips Unbound, tweaked to suit her political progress since then. \u2712Celebrity lifestyles make the curse of the cover star an ever-present possibility for magazine editors, but the launch issue of Miss Vogue (edited by Emily Sheffield, Samantha Cameron&apos;s sister) had especially bad luck in setting a new record for the lead time between the mag coming out and the disgrace of the celeb chosen as icon and, arguably, role model: minus one day. That photo of the monobrowed model Cara Delevingne on her doorstep, vainly trying to put her foot on a packet of white powder before the paps snapped it, first surfaced in the Sun on 5 May, just in time for the first Miss Vogue becoming available to susceptible girls, with &quot;all-star Cara!&quot; on the front \u2013 and the photo starting to be used everywhere else \u2013 the following day. \u2712To mark Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s retirement, the Daily Mail gave its prime op-ed slot to Lord Hattersley, who had some reservations about the mere knight but argued that (as the headline put it) &quot;if you want to be the best, you have to breathe fire&quot;. If any Mail aficionados failed to immediately sense a parallel, they must have grasped it as Hattersley cited aspects of Ferguson&apos;s monomaniacal style: his furious berating of underperforming officials and players, &quot;complete faith in his own judgment&quot;, protracted refusal to do interviews, etc. Yet oddly, though Bismarck, Montgomery, Patton and Thatcher all got a mention, the obvious example closer to hand of anger, obsession, the will to win and longevity at the top (20 years to Ferguson&apos;s 27) was missing as the portly peer coyly left Paul Dacre unnamed. \u2712Either the award-winning team behind the upcoming three-parter The Iraq War have a gigantic scoop on their hands, or something has (perhaps aptly) gone awry in the Beeb&apos;s press release sexing up the series. &quot;Top Iraqis who reveal their side of the tense build-up,&quot; the blurb burbles, &quot;include Saddam&apos;s intelligence chiefs [and] top US, British and French politicians \u2013 Colin Powell, Jack Straw, General Petraeus, CIA bosses, Dominique de Villepin...&quot; Straw and Petraeus Iraqi all along, eh? It looks set to make Homeland seem timidly restrained in its plotting. \u2712Monkey has been sent what seems to be a draft of the job ad for BBC4 controller, although admittedly it&apos;s such a departure from the corporation&apos;s usual style that the possibility that it&apos;s a phished fake (the Syrian Electronic Army will stop at nothing) can&apos;t be ruled out. After the standard boilerplate, it does little to woo applicants: &quot;(1) There is no money: we won&apos;t deny Broadcast&apos;s figure of a \u00a326m annual budget, or \u00a3500,000 a week.

Ministers argue the test will help to dramatically improve literacy standards, but teaching unions warn it could have the opposite effect. Pupils will be required to spell words such as &quot;separate&quot;, &quot;preferred&quot; and &quot;necessary&quot; as part of the 15-minute spelling test. They will be quizzed on the use of colons, apostrophes, ellipses and subordinate clauses in the 45-minute grammar exam. A government review into the national tests sat by 11-year-olds \u2013 known as Sats \u2013 recommended pupils sit a spelling, punctuation, grammar and vocabulary test that was marked by independent examiners. The government said in other parts of the world, such as the US, Canada and Singapore, children take similar tests. But the tests have proved deeply unpopular with teaching unions. The results will be used to judge schools in league tables and the unions warn that this will lead to teachers &quot;teaching to the test&quot;. Children, aware of how important the tests are, will become needlessly anxious about them. At its annual conference in Liverpool, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) passed a motion calling for a boycott of the tests. Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said pupils&apos; grammar, punctuation and spelling were already assessed by teachers on a daily basis. &quot;This will become yet another high-stakes accountability measure which will narrow the curriculum still further, cause needless stress for children and encourage teaching to the test. As such, it may actually prove counterproductive to teachers&apos; efforts to improve writing skills,&quot; she said. &quot;What is needed is an assessment system which supports real learning in real contexts and encourages children to progress through their education with confidence, not made to feel like failures.&quot; The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said a portfolio of a pupil&apos;s work was a better indicator of their spelling and grammar than a new test. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the NAHT, said the test focused on the knowledge of grammar in the abstract. &quot;It tells us nothing about how someone uses that knowledge to communicate. Just because you can circle an adverb in a multiple choice test does not mean you know how to use an adverb appropriately,&quot; he said. &quot;We already have a better test, which is the assessment of the student&apos;s portfolio of work from across year six. Why limit ourselves to whether someone can spot an adverb, when we can examine how they use them? Why limit ourselves to the spellings of 20 words, when we can look at the spellings of thousands? Even the government&apos;s own experts agree that the technical aspects of English are best assessed in the context of a full composition.&quot; Elizabeth Truss, an education minister, said many children struggled with the basics of the English language at primary school and never caught up. &quot;That is why employers bemoan the poor literacy of so many school and college leavers,&quot; she said. &quot;This new test will mean that children are again taught the skills they need to understand our language, and to use it properly, creatively and effectively.&quot; Meanwhile, teachers have spotted an error in Monday&apos;s reading test for 11-year-olds. In the instructions for the test, pupils were told: &quot;Different question need to be answered in different ways&quot;. The Standards and Testing Agency, an executive agency of the Department for Education, is in charge of the development and delivery of the tests.

Each time I try to explain what I research, my mind skims through the intricacies of a definition that is neither precise nor finite in scope. In interviews in Singapore and throughout Taiwan and over the last four months, I have asked social entrepreneurs their definition of social enterprise, and social innovation. Here&apos;s my latest conclusion: it doesn&apos;t really matter. Each foundation, social enterprise, or funding agency I have interviewed has defined social innovation in the positive; no one has decidedly excluded an organisation or group from their view of social innovation. The definition of social entrepreneurship has been more precise, favouring a focus on financial sustainability (&quot;a capitalist mind and a socialist heart&quot; in the words of entrepreneur Priya Chen from Aurora Social Enterprise Co), but most people still give open and growing definitions of a field, sector and way of thinking that is expansive in its ambition to tackle pressing social problems. Amid this lack of clarity on definitional issues, examining whom social innovations serve is perhaps a more important way of analysing social innovation capacity: it shows you who is empowered to solve social problems within a local economy. Does social innovation happen with government, non-profit organisations, or members of the marginalised communities themselves? Here in Taiwan, social innovation and social enterprise seem to concentrate on specific thematic issues, predominantly employment, disability inclusion and matters related to aboriginal communities, rather than taking place in one specific sector. However, it&apos;s hard to tell whether the prevalence of social innovations in these areas is because of truly innovative solutions stemming from those sectors, or is the result of prevalent subsidies. Indeed, the availability of subsidies in those areas could also be considered a kind of social innovation, because they empower those with a vested interest in crafting and delivering a solution. The role of government policy and funding in dictating where social innovation takes place can be significant in the absence of a strong pool of social entrepreneurs. In Singapore, many of the most prominent social enterprises do not focus on issues facing exclusively Singapore. Many organisations, like the World Toilet Organisation, are global in their reach. However, Jack Sim, the dynamic founder of WTO, began his work focused on what he noticed as an issue in Singapore before extending his mandate and forming the WTO. Perhaps, then, what is unique about Singapore is not the nature of its social challenges or marginalised communities, but that its ecosystem and economy are structured to be outward-facing and conducive to growth. It is easier to imagine this sort of structure functioning in a city-state of five million people than a country with greater size and population. The differences in whom social innovations serve in different environments makes the lack of standard definition meaningful: with one definition, it might be easier to unify people working within or across similar subject matter, but more difficult to unify those working under different constraints and in different environments. In South Korea, the Leveraging Social Enterprise Act quantitatively evaluates social enterprises, and businesses cannot use the moniker without being registered. There may be some value in such an approach to limit the novelty of &quot;social enterprise&quot; as a buzzword (if not as a technical understanding of the sector); five years ago, &quot;international&quot; was the buzzword among organisations and government ministries. Now &quot;innovation&quot; has taken the helm \u2013 a desirable word to describe oneself, yet a difficult one to measure against. By repeatedly asking what social innovation is, I&apos;ve seen that the best social innovations and the social entrepreneurs behind them all have laser-sharp focus on their end users and solving their pains, and that they prize financial sustainability so they can keep doing it. Precise definitions and tailored taxation models might be helpful, but they&apos;re not critical to identify effectively and leverage social enterprise opportunities, and are not what will inspire the next generation of change makers. So how do we harness the ambiguity of social innovation? Governments could begin by making it easier for innovation entities \u2013 social enterprises, social purpose businesses, revenue-generating non-profits and innovation entities within larger organizations \u2013 to have the flexibility they need to succeed. Social innovators need to continue drawing outside the lines without being placed in government-approved buckets that do not accurately capture the type of work they do. Practitioners can begin to talk about social innovation in terms of metrics, such as community engagement and sustainability, and the media and academics can spend less time glorifying organisations for merely associating with &quot;innovation&quot; and praise real efforts toward testing new financial model and learning sharing between organisations. So, after all the questioning, it turns out that I don&apos;t care about the definition. Please, join the &quot;social innovation&quot; bandwagon. But there should be standardised metrics, there should be reporting, and we should begin to see social innovation in terms of the communities they serve and not just how its defined.

Working with people from different cultures can pave the way to more advanced projects once back in the UK, and networking internationally is useful for sharing ideas and information. Working abroad is a popular idea. A recent survey by Trendence suggested that 22% of graduates expected to go abroad to find work, although this figure may be more a reflection on UK employment prospects than a fully formed strategy, according to Chris Phillips, information and research director at GTI. But there are barriers for UK graduates when seeking career success abroad. Some are not as globally-focused as those from other countries, who may have already had international placements while at university. This means it can be hard to stand out against strong local competition. Perhaps the biggest obstacle is skills: most international positions require language proficiency as well as technical skills. Increasing numbers of graduates are interested in international experience and, although America and Australia have always been popular locations, career mobility across Europe is now highly desirable for graduates and companies. This means that graduates who can speak a second or third language are in a particularly strong position. Where the opportunities are There are worldwide skills gaps which present opportunities for those who can fill them. Countries such as India and China are hot markets with strong growth in GDP. Mexico and Brazil both have skills shortages, particularly in engineering, life sciences, finance and oil and gas. Singapore and Hong Kong are also attractive, partly because it&apos;s relatively easy to hire from overseas, but also because English is widely spoken. The hardest-to-fill positions across the globe are generally in IT, engineering, sales, production and research and development, although this differs between countries so it&apos;s worth researching if you have a particular location in mind. How to get started Structured graduate schemes with multinationals are one way in to an international career. Phillips says: &quot;Most international companies have a base in the UK and advertise jobs to start in London.&quot; Look for companies where you can relocate after being taken on, rather than holding out for an international position straightaway. If you don&apos;t get on a scheme, or you&apos;re looking for a second or third job, keep your eye on jobs boards. Smaller niche sites are also useful. For example, StartupChile is a Chilean-government initiative designed to attract international entrepreneurs, or Arcticstartup, which advertises roles in Scandinavian countries. You could also consider taking up international work and study placements. Paul Brown from Placement UK points out that a much stronger work placement culture at university level exists in Europe. UK students, however, can take advantage of schemes, such as the Erasmus programme, to study in EU universities for set periods of time. The Association of Graduate Recruiters carried out research with the Council for Industry and Higher Education to explore what businesses need from global graduates. Multilingualism was considered a complementary rather than essential, while the most-prized skills were the ability to work collaboratively with people from diverse backgrounds and countries, and excellent communication skills.

They all appear somewhere in Michael Gove&apos;s pantheon of disapproval. The education secretary&apos;s latest speech about the problems besetting education is classic Gove. It is very engaging, thought provoking and entertaining. His view on raising the bar of aspiration for all young people is absolutely right. Yet his method is so wrong. As principal of an academic school where aspiration is part of our DNA, I really do get Gove&apos;s passion for excellence. However, what mystifies me is his very personal take on what should matter in the pursuit of excellence. Gove referenced George Elliot&apos;s Middlemarch as illustrative of the kind of book a 17 year old should be reading for pleasure. This struck a chord with me. As a 13 year old back in the last century I was so inspired by a BBC mini-series of War and Peace starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Dobie that I read the trilogy. While I cannot claim to have truly appreciated this classic piece of literature, I knew I was reading something very special which helped awaken in me a lifelong love of history. I am sure Gove would approve of such cultural aspiration from a working class daughter of Irish immigrants. Yet I should never have even considered reading such a vast tome without the stimulus of the TV series. And this is the point. Just as the medium of television opened up the world of Tolstoy to me, today television is one of just a multitude of possibilities for engaging the young. Their cultural landscape is hugely varied. What interests them? Well, I think sober study of classic literature and dry narrative history do not register highly. Young people need an approach which connects with them and the values in their world. As such, Gove&apos;s dismissive attitude to cultural references which are decidedly low brow entirely miss the point. Mr Men? Disney? Why not if they contribute to understanding and learning. It is not about denigrating, it is about creating. Why not a rap in Latin? Blind Date in the court of Henry VIII? iPad puppet pals for any number of learning opportunities? All tried and trusted approaches in one academic school in Cambridge. Rather than looking to the familiar, everyone involved in education should be thinking differently about learning. The digital world is a game changer. And we must change with it. If Angry Birds, the staple digital game of many youngsters, inspires a young person to learn coding surely that is a desirable outcome? If the Garage Band app provides a creative platform for an aspiring young musician isn&apos;t this to be applauded? Both activities can be deemed distractions \u2013 but they need not be. We are on the nursery slopes of digital learning. The potential for transformation of the conventional educational paradigm is extraordinary. Yet none of this registers in the world of the secretary of state for education. It strikes me that Gove&apos;s well-meaning attempts to promote excellence for all young people is being enacted in a parallel universe. The Aunt Sallies highlighted in Mr Gove&apos;s recent speech will be as nothing compared to future digital &quot;distractions&quot; \u2013 sorry, learning. Final thought. A delegation of teachers from an academic school in Singapore visited us recently to learn about our experience of iPads. I thought that the principal and her staff would be focused on the use of iPads to improve academic attainment. After all, Singapore is flying high in Gove&apos;s favourite international league table, PISA. I was surprised and encouraged to learn that this particular school was, like us, concerned with the holistic nature of education and how the digital revolution impacted upon young people. We felt a real connection with the educators who worked in a school on the other side of the world. Therefore it is disappointing that the educational policy in this country feels like we are living in a foreign country. Tricia Kelleher is principal of The Stephen Perse Foundation.

The initial public offering (IPO) of F1 is on track to take place in the next 12 months despite its chief executive Bernie Ecclestone being engulfed in a legal battle over payment of an alleged bribe. CVC originally intended to float F1 in June last year but put the brakes on the plan due to the worsening eurozone crisis. Instead, it cut its stake by around half through selling 28.4% of F1 for $2.1bn to money managers BlackRock, Waddell &amp; Reed and Norges, the investment division of Norway&apos;s central bank. The source said that CVC &quot;isn&apos;t planning to sell more stakes before the float. If you look at Discovery Channel and other comparables, the market is up 25% since we tried to IPO last year so just mathematically applying the new pricing for the company, it is worth 25% more. I certainly think you could shoot for $12bn.&quot; As there are no other major quoted sports rights management companies, F1 compares itself to media companies such as Nasdaq-listed business Discovery Communications. It runs the Discovery Channel and over the past year its shares have risen over 50%. &quot;Sport businesses and content businesses are in significant demand and F1 is one of the very best,&quot; said the source adding that &quot;I don&apos;t see why the IPO would not be on track for the next 12 months.&quot; However, the road ahead is not clear. F1 boss Ecclestone is embroiled in multiple law suits relating to a $44m payment made by him and his family trust to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky shortly after CVC bought F1 in 2006. Gribkowsky was chief risk officer of German bank BayernLB which sold its 47.2% stake in F1 to CVC. German prosecutors believe that Ecclestone paid the money to Gribkowsky to steer the sale of F1 to CVC as it had agreed to retain him as the sport&apos;s boss. Ecclestone denies this and says that Gribkowsky threatened to make false allegations about his tax affairs to the Inland Revenue if the money was not paid. In June last year a Munich court found Gribkowsky guilty of receiving a bribe and sentenced him to eight-and-a-half years in prison. Media outlets in Germany recently claimed that Ecclestone has been charged with bribery but he says that the prosecutors haven&apos;t contacted him. &quot;I haven&apos;t heard anything from them,&quot; Ecclestone told the Guardian. &quot;I don&apos;t know what they are doing. At the moment I am a suspect with five other people. If they charge me presumably they will have to charge the other people. I hope they don&apos;t but I think they will. Then we will see what happens. That doesn&apos;t mean to say there will be a trial.&quot; The F1 boss added: &quot;CVC are standing by me 100%.&quot; Under German criminal law, if someone is charged, a court has to decide whether to bring the case to a trial or proceedings could be dropped in exchange for a &apos;non-penal payment.&apos; Ecclestone&apos;s German law firm Thomas Deckers Wehnert Elsner said: &quot;The documents with the charges from the Munich prosecutor&apos;s office have not yet been received by the defence. Therefore, we cannot provide a statement. The defence sticks to its view that Mr. Ecclestone has neither committed bribery nor played any part in committing a fiduciary breach of trust.&quot; Ecclestone is also facing a civil suit in London&apos;s high court from German media company Constantin Medien, which claims that it lost out on a profit-share agreement from the sale because F1 was in fact worth more than CVC paid. &quot;I think we need to clarify Bernie&apos;s situation in Germany and I think once that is clear the market would love an IPO,&quot; said the source. He insisted that CVC has no plans to replace Ecclestone. However, this will have to be considered at some stage in future since he turns 83 this year. F1 only has 313 staff and 10 senior management. There is no deputy or chief operating officer waiting to take over the driving seat. Ecclestone is responsible for all divisions of the company and all geographic areas rather than having separate bosses running them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/may/18/more-reports-emirates-delays", "sentences": ["AD from Birmingham recited a similar tale on a flight to Adalaide, while RP from Worcester wrote: &quot;We have been in dispute with Emirates over an almost identical claim since we returned from Singapore in February and would be very interested in your further comments on this scenario and whether Emirates will take some responsibility for their shoddy customer service in this regard.&quot; After publication last week, Emirates contacted us again, insisting that the original complainant was not entitled to compensation as the second flight from Dubai did not come under the remit of EC 261/2004 rules that cover delayed and cancelled flights."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-18T06:00:33Z", "title": "More reports of Emirates delays", "tags": ["Consumer rights", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Airline industry", "Business", "Flights", "Travel"], "article": "Last week we featured the case of JL, from Sheffield who complained that Emirates airline had failed to compensate her for long delays she suffered on a flight to Australia as a result of changing planes in Dubai.

As the former Tory chancellor Lord Howe warned that the prime minister is losing control of his party over Europe, Mandelson described the Eurosceptics as the &quot;provisional wing&quot; of the Tory party. Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, hit back at Lord Howe. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t think those views actually represent the reality. The substance is that the Conservative party says if we are going to be successful in that global race we need to renegotiate that relationship with Europe and give the British people a say.&quot; But Mandelson echoed Howe&apos;s warning, though he used a more dramatic analogy. He said: &quot;We all know what&apos;s going on inside the Conservative party. The UK Isolation party and their fellow travellers in the Conservatives are sort of operating a Soprano-style protection racket inside the Conservative party. They are saying: &apos;Do what we want, give us what we are demanding, or we are going to burn your home down.&apos;&quot; The former Northern Ireland secretary even appeared to liken the Eurosceptics to the provisional wing of the Irish republican movement. He said: &quot;Just because one wing - the provisional wing - of the Conservative party want to bring down their leader and change their party&apos;s policy and are using this as an issue to do so is not a good reason to hold a referendum.&quot; Mandelson, who was a close adviser to two prime ministers, offered some advice to Cameron. &quot;Now, in my view, the prime minister has got to say: &apos;Enough is enough. You guys have got to clear off. Take your tanks off my lawn. I am going to lead this party and govern this country in the way that serves its true economic national interest and I am going to do so without being bullied around by a bunch of people whose only interest is to be separate from Europe, not to create the prosperity for Britain and the trade and other economic opportunities by staying within Europe and its single market.&apos;&quot; Mandelson endorsed Ed Miliband&apos;s position on an EU referendum. &quot;On this issue they are right. They are saying yes to a referendum if there is some significant change in the relationship. But no, not an in-out referendum just for the sake of having a referendum, which would be a lottery. You couldn&apos;t predict what the outcome would be.&quot; In a sign of how the Conservative party has shifted in a Eurosceptic direction over the last 15 years, the former cabinet minister John Redwood praised Cameron as he confirmed he had offered advice ahead of his EU speech in January. Redwood, who challenged John Major for the Tory leadership in 1995 over Europe, said: &quot;We went to the prime minister privately and helped him with the Bloomberg speech and we are very happy with his new policy. Now we wish to get on with it.&quot; Hunt said: &quot;If you look at the substance of the issue the Conservative party is absolutely united. We look at the EU and we worry about Britain&apos;s ability to compete in the global race. We look at the regulations and the red tape that comes from Europe\u00a0\u2026 and if you go into the boardrooms in New York, or Tokyo or Singapore they think the European economy is frankly a joke.&quot; Their interventions came after Howe lambasted Cameron over Europe. The former chancellor wrote in the Observer: &quot;Sadly, by making it clear in January that he opposes the current terms of UK membership of the EU, the prime minister has opened a Pandora&apos;s box politically and seems to be losing control of his party in the process. &quot;The ratchet-effect of Euroscepticism has now gone so far that the Conservative leadership is in effect running scared of its own backbenchers, let alone Ukip, having allowed deep anti-Europeanism to infect the very soul of the party.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/19/military-attack-singapore-red-cadeaux-kranji", "sentences": ["The Hong Kong-based Australian, son of George Moore, one of his country&apos;s greatest jockeys, finally put the seal on his CV on a dazzling night for what is now the Special Administrative Region of China when sending out the first two home in the \u00a31.5m Singapore Airlines International Cup on Sunday.", "Third place went to Super Easy who has taken over the mantle of Singaporean sprint champion from the frequently sidelined Rocket Man; and fourth, running a superb race on the tight Kranji track under Johnny Murtagh, was Ireland&apos;s Balmont Mast, trained by Edward Lynam."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-19T14:58:42Z", "title": "Military Attack wins Singapore Airlines Cup to make it Hong Kong's night", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "It has for a long time been one of the major anomalies of racing that the multiple champion trainer John Moore, by far the most successful producer of Group-race winners in Hong Kong, had never won a Group One race overseas. The Hong Kong-based Australian, son of George Moore, one of his country&apos;s greatest jockeys, finally put the seal on his CV on a dazzling night for what is now the Special Administrative Region of China when sending out the first two home in the \u00a31.5m Singapore Airlines International Cup on Sunday. Not only did Moore deliver the winner, Military Attack, who raced in Britain as Rave, but also the second Dan Excel, who in Ireland was known as Dunboyne Express. It must have been a source of particular satisfaction to Moore and all concerned with Hong Kong racing that the first and second were following up on their victories on 28 April and 5 May in the Audemars Piguet Queen Elizabeth II Cup and Champions Mile respectively. Suggestions in this space after the Mile that it had been a substandard Group One race were proved emphatically wrong. Humble pie does not taste too bad if you put enough soy sauce on it. From the moment Hong Kong&apos;s jockey of the moment Zac Purton, another Australian, kicked for home early in the straight after taking over from the frontrunning Meandre, the race was over, and the winner came home unchallenged by just over three lengths in a performance that matched for splendour even compatriot Lucky Nine&apos;s in the earlier KrisFlyer International Sprint. Dan Excel held on gamely for second with Australia&apos;s Mawingo a head away in third. Britain&apos;s Red Cadeaux, facing what seemed to many a near impossible task in coming back from his third in the two-mile Spring Tenno Sho in Japan ran a brave race but was caught wide from the seven gate and found the effort too much with his run petering out in the last couple of furlongs as he kept on at his own pace to finish eighth. &quot;He found the ground too fast for him&quot; said his jockey, G\u00e9rald Moss\u00e9. That may have been the final straw for the gallant globetrotter. Britain&apos;s other representative, the Jane Chapple-Hyam-trained Mull Of Killough, winner of his previous three races at Newmarket, was unable to match those efforts round Kranji&apos;s turns but ran on very well for George Baker to take fifth place in a race in which the winner broke two minutes \u2013 the 10 furlongs completed 1min 58sec. All else paled though in comparison with the outstanding performances by the winners of the two international Group Ones. Military Attack and Lucky Nine were special ones at Kranji. This was Hong Kong&apos;s night. KrisFlyer International Lucky Nine routed the opposition in a very high quality running of the \u00a3500,000 Group One KrisFlyer International Sprint at Kranji on Sunday to confirm the power of Hong Kong horses on the global sprinting scene. The six-year-old son of Dubawi, trained by the Englishman Caspar Fownes who was enjoying his second triumph in the race after Green Birdie&apos;s victory in 2010, charged into the lead halfway up the straight and quickly overwhelmed his rivals to win unchallenged by four lengths in a time for the 6 furlongs of 1min 08.71sec. Second was the Australian Bel Sprinter who had romped home in the Group One Galaxy at Rosehill before finishing just over five lengths third to Black Caviar at Randwick in April. But he was no match at all for Lucky Nine, winner of the 2011 Hong Kong Sprint, who was returning to his very best after two relatively modest performances back home at Sha Tin. Third place went to Super Easy who has taken over the mantle of Singaporean sprint champion from the frequently sidelined Rocket Man; and fourth, running a superb race on the tight Kranji track under Johnny Murtagh, was Ireland&apos;s Balmont Mast, trained by Edward Lynam. &quot;I got a little bit squeezed at the gate&quot; said Murtagh, &quot;and was a bit further back than I wanted. But he stayed on really well and in a few more strides could well have finished second.&quot; The brilliant winner would a strong contender for the Diamond Jubilee at Royal Ascot if he makes the trip but Fownes warned afterwards: &quot;We&apos;ll have to wait and see. He&apos;s had his problems with blood in his trachea last time and a bone chip which may have troubled him but has responded to treatment. Australia [for the Patinak Sprint] is another possibility, but we&apos;ll have to see how he comes out of this race.&quot; Demonstrating all the talent for public relations which is characteristic of almost all Hong Kong-based trainers, Fownes, maintaining impressive cool in the equatorial heat, added: &quot;It was a great result this evening and I&apos;m very pleased for all the fans in Hong Kong where they really love their racing.&quot; Prebble&apos;s comment sums the race up. &quot;Lucky Nine&apos;s confidence has come back. He did his job beautifully tonight.

Relations between the government and university-based teacher educators have reached a new low amid claims that a Department for Education agency has been attempting to lure would-be students away from the traditional higher education sector towards a favoured ministerial project. An email sent by the National College for Teaching and Leadership \u2013 which oversees both traditional, university-based provision and the new School Direct school-based route \u2013 sought to persuade prospective postgraduate certificate in education university trainees to consider its rival. It reads: &quot;You may have already applied for a PGCE by now, but have you thought about applying for School Direct?&quot; It continues, under &quot;Why you should apply for School Direct&quot;: &quot;School Direct is different. That&apos;s because you&apos;re part of a school team from day one, where you can train as a teacher with the expectation of a job once you qualify. &quot;It&apos;s free to apply. Simple too.&quot; The Universities&apos; Council for the Education of Teachers (Ucet) has furiously accused the government of trying to &quot;manipulate&quot; the teacher-education market, arguing that its members have tried to play fair by not discouraging would-be students away from School Direct, which is the favoured route of the education secretary, Michael Gove. Just as intriguing, though, is why officials felt the need to make the appeal. Although the DfE published figures this month suggesting applications for School Direct have been very healthy, questions have been raised about the detail behind the numbers, amid persistent rumours that the total actually accepted on to School Direct is still low. Is the DfE getting desperate? Governors throw in towel The highest-profile battle fought by parents this year against moves by the government to enforce an academy &quot;sponsor&quot; on a non-academy school seems to have been lost. Governors at Roke primary in Kenley, Surrey, voted by a 2-1 majority to stop contesting its transfer to the Harris academy chain, bringing to an end four months of furious campaigning by parents. This was triggered after the government responded to a &quot;requires improvement&quot; Ofsted verdict on the previously &quot;outstanding&quot; Roke by insisting that the school was to be sponsored by Harris, rather than another local academy seemingly favoured by governors and parents. The majority of governors are understood to have come to the view that the arrival of Harris in September had become the only way to stabilise the school, which lost its headteacher last month. But parent campaigners are bitterly disappointed, complaining they were not consulted, and that they had raised money for a legal challenge. This would now not work, said a source, without governor support. Ironically, governors have just been sent the results of the consultation carried out by Harris on the plans. Parents are said to have voted by clear majorities both against Harris&apos;s sponsorship and against any move to academy status. So much for local democracy. School secrets A London local authority is facing pressure to release an investigation report on management practice at a school once described as &quot;outstanding&quot; by Ofsted. Newham council has rejected a freedom of information request for the report, which was written about activities at Langdon school in the period from 2004 to 2009, after a probe by education consultant Tim Blanchard. Allegations investigated included claims that free school meals and pupil attendance data were falsified. Newham has relied on a provision within freedom of information legislation that can allow the non-release of reports on the basis that individuals could be identified. Rick Helm, a former teacher at the school who made the request, is challenging the decision through the information commissioner. Newham said: &quot;Newham council&apos;s decision [not to release the report] is currently being reviewed by the information commissioner. It would be inappropriate to comment further.&quot; Langdon was in the spotlight in 2005 when pupils travelled to Singapore to support London&apos;s successful Olympics bid. A letter sent to Langdon staff last year, by a second investigator into the affair, Susan Paul, said that Blanchard&apos;s report had found evidence of a &quot;systematic process involving professional malpractice designed to show the school in the best light educationally and also to benefit financially&quot;. It also said Blanchard had concluded that attendance, exclusions and free school meals data had been falsified and that &quot;inappropriate processes&quot; had been followed with regard to keeping pupils officially &quot;on-roll&quot; and &quot;off-roll&quot;. Paul wrote to staff saying she wanted to &quot;assess and if necessary challenge&quot; Blanchard&apos;s findings. Education Guardian understands Paul&apos;s investigation never concluded. Asked to comment, Newham said: &quot;Following an independent investigation into serious allegations regarding management and administrative matters at the school between 2004 and 2009, six members of staff were suspended. Disciplinary procedures were undertaken \u2026 resulting in a number of these members of staff leaving. There has been no further evidence of management irregularities.&quot; It added that improvements had since been made to teaching and management. Helm said: &quot;I am disappointed that Newham has not released the report, as there needs to be a resolution of these issues.&quot; Last month, the school lost its &quot;outstanding&quot; rating and was placed in special measures."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/21/the-fiver-mourinho-tearful-exit", "sentences": ["RECOMMENDED VIEWING Atl\u00e9tico Madrid v 130 youngsters in a Singapore charity match."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-21T14:54:56Z", "title": "The Fiver | Saying with their arms all the things they could never say with their voices", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "ROMANCING THE STONE Florentino P\u00e9rez walked into the Valdebebas training ground canteen and, though he could not see his face, spotted him immediately. How could he not? Even after all these years he was unmistakeable. In a corner of the empty room there he was, sitting at his Special table, his Special back turned to him, his Special fingers toying absentmindedly at his Special coffee cup. P\u00e9rez felt the sour rush of tears as he noticed the Real Madrid jacket hanging on the back of his chair. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho had made no sign that he had heard his club president walk in, at least, no sign to the casual observer. But P\u00e9rez knew he knew. The tiniest hunch in the shoulder, the subtlest change in the atmosphere. After three years, you pick up on things others don&apos;t. &quot;Jos\u00e9, I \u2026&quot; It was a scene both men had played over in their minds: the meaning-laden gestures, the pregnant pauses, the cadence of each sentence, the weight of every word. Yet these things never quite work out exactly as planned. Dress rehearsals can&apos;t prepare you for the final act. P\u00e9rez took an urgent, awkward step towards the manager. His carefully polished shoe bunted the leg of table, which rocked then toppled, and the slap of its plastic frame on the Linoleum echoed through the empty room. As the clatter died away Mourinho, at last, turned, the makings of a smile playing across his face but the pain all too obvious in those Special eyes. P\u00e9rez would reflect later than he had never seen the man look so tired \u2013 tired to his bones, to his sinews, to the core of his being \u2013 but at the time there was just relief, relief that it was started. The end had its beginning. &quot;You always were so clumsy, Florentino. It&apos;s OK. We both know why we&apos;re here. It was fun while it lasted, but \u2026&quot; The next two words, two bullets that would bury their points into the souls of the two men never to be prized out, caught in his throat. Their enormity, their finality, kept them just out of reach, even now. Even here, at the end of things. A clock ticked. A door creaked in some distant, unseen corridor. Noises from another universe, another reality billions of miles away from the here, the now. It was time. &quot; \u2026 it&apos;s over.&quot; &quot;Yes, Jos\u00e9. It&apos;s over.&quot; They had expected the words to clang into the empty space, throw painful echoes back. They had expected their ears to ring with the fizzing of their psychological shrapnel. Instead there was silence. Silence and, in each of their hearts, a lightening, a lifting of the load. Mourinho stood now to face the president and P\u00e9rez, so shamed by the weakness of his own tears as they had begun to burn their way down his cheeks, saw that the manager too was crying Special tears. Nearly there. It was almost over. P\u00e9rez knew that this time it was he who must speak, he who must say the words, he who must send them spinning over this final hurdle. He owed the manager that much. &quot;Just one more thing Jos\u00e9. I [sob] don&apos;t want [blub] to pay the [sniff] \u00a316.9m contract break clause.&quot; The effort was too much. P\u00e9rez buried his face in his hands and wept, but through the shoulder-juddering spasms the reply rang clearly. &quot;And I [sniff] don&apos;t want to [sob] pay the [blub] \u00a316.9m contract break clause either.&quot; Through the tears it was P\u00e9rez&apos;s turn to smile, an expression that dominoed its way on to the Special face of the man standing now just a yard away. The irony was not lost on either of them \u2013 that here, at their parting, they were as one once more. &quot;Then \u2026 then let none of us pay. Let that be our gift \u2026 our gift to the other.&quot; Mourinho nodded, wiped a sleeve across his face, lifted his chin, opened his arms. One last lingering embrace, and through it each tried to say with their arms all the things they could never say with their voices \u2013 the good times, the trophies, the thank yous, the goodbyes. They came apart. &quot;Go. Go back to them. Go now. Go \u2026 and be happy.&quot; QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;[My wife] wrote a book for children.

He worked as a derivatives trader in a small European country and now trades for a big institution in London after completing a quantitative degree in continental Europe. &quot;It&apos;s funny. I am the current public bogeyman \u2013 not only am I a migrant, but I am a &quot;banker&quot; (deliberate use of inverted commas) too! Ironically, I can buy financial security by undertaking a job dealing with understanding insecurity and uncertainty. That&apos;s a trade I am prepared to make. &quot;Fifteen years ago this job was completely different. Earlier practitioners would be standing up for ten hours in the &quot;pit&quot;, estimating option prices by plugging numbers into a basic calculator (big fat finger error risk!), shouting and waving hand signals. These days you sit in front of many computer screens, clicking and updating code. Lunch would occasionally be my left hand drinking soup and my right hand on the mouse. Trading options is ideal for someone who likes being in front of a screen. &quot;When I was working as a derivatives trader in a small European country my routine went like this: I&apos;d come into the office just before 8am and switch on my seven screens. There are many programs to log into. I sort each data feed to update me preferentially on news in the underlying names I trade and on macro developments. I ensure my connections to all relevant exchanges are functioning. I calculate hedge limits and input them into the order book. I make sure all this is done before 8.45am, as the market opens at 9am. At 9.01am there can be some juicy trades \u2013 you want to be fast. I would leave around 6.30pm. Weekends were free. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter how much of a mathematical genius you are \u2013 when you first come in the challenge is learning how all the systems work. It&apos;s more about systems now than ever before. &quot;I could trade options without knowing the exact proofs of their pricing. The model does that for you. It&apos;s like trading cars. You don&apos;t need to know every last detail of how, say, the piston works. What the firm wants is someone quick, assertive, mathematically competent, prepared to optimise reward/risk ratios. &quot;Some derivatives traders take nearly three hours every day to calculate the value of their positions and their P&amp;L \u2013 I saw it in inflation instruments, but I don&apos;t know exactly how all of them work. There may be &quot;options on options&quot;, &quot;path-dependent options&quot;, &quot;correlation products&quot; and much more. &quot;You&apos;re asking how a risk manager would oversee a dozen traders like that, each in his own field. Well, as an options trader you are your own risk manager \u2013 particularly at a smaller firm. I wasn&apos;t at a company with a big retail division attached to it. If we screw up then we take the hit (as we should!), as do the (wealthy) investors in the firm. No bailouts for us. In general the more complex and opaque the product, the more a trader needs to act as a risk manager. He may be one of the few people who fully understand the risks, though I think larger institutions have been bulking up with sharp risk managers of late, who don&apos;t just hold their tongues. &quot;You don&apos;t see people doing this work their whole lives. Trading can take over your life \u2013 but only if you let it! It can be surprisingly tiring staring at a screen intently for hours, clicking every few seconds. But being a fisherman in Comoros, a paramedic in Eritrea or a lumberjack in Zaire must be way more tiring, surely? &quot;Some people in finance can exaggerate a lot. I want to emphasise that to the readers. It&apos;s not that stressful! I had my evenings free. I could relax. I could play sport. Sure \u2013 I work hard, but so do many billions of people and for far less pay too. I could basically manage my housework myself too, so it couldn&apos;t have been that draining. Most important to me as a migrant worker was that I could save over 50% of my net salary \u2013 this is really lucky coming from a continent where 25% of people in my age group are unemployed and even more have no savings. I am very fortunate. &quot;Things seem very different in London, where finance is more of a lifestyle and a mentality. In northern Europe (possibly excluding Frankfurt) working in finance did not set you apart from society. &quot;In London if you don&apos;t join your mates for a drink after work, it can be seen as a signal of disinterest. There&apos;s a big culture of spending and splashing out. And job security is probably worse. Where I worked in northern Europe, people conceal their wealth. Ostentatious behaviour is socially unacceptable. There isn&apos;t any discrimination towards the back office. Seniors don&apos;t make juniors get food orders. No need for pinstripes. &quot;It was completely natural for the secretary to join us for a drink. And it wasn&apos;t like London where sometimes you can&apos;t take your full annual leave without worrying what signal that may send out. &quot;From a lifestyle perspective I believe you have to be flexible. As migrants we are ideally placed to do that. Big institutions are still prepared to offer us work visa sponsorship. If I stayed in northern Europe for too long I might be pigeonholed. You can live a comfortable life. But at some point in your career you tend to gravitate to one of the &quot;hubs&quot; (London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore). &quot;I just can&apos;t plan my career more than two years ahead. The industry can change quickly anyway \u2013 for example, suppose you were trading in Sweden before the financial transactions tax came in. After it was extended in 1989 to cover a wider range of instruments, 98% of volumes in bond derivatives in Stockholm went elsewhere. Imagine you had been trading such products, but had married a local woman who insisted on staying put. What do you do? Will you get another similar job in a niche market if you aren&apos;t prepared to migrate? Will you even be the first choice to be hired when volumes come back? Now imagine you are a migrant \u2013 probably a single man \u2013 no wife, no kids, no house, just savings. It&apos;s easier for us, isn&apos;t it? &quot;If you&apos;re mid-level and you get laid off, it can be very difficult to get back in. Some financiers in London over-leverage themselves and save virtually nothing, despite their high salaries. &quot;I don&apos;t understand how they can&apos;t apply the same rules of risk management to their personal lives as they do in their professional lives. How could they be so over-confident? I don&apos;t think the state steps in to help that much in the Anglo-Saxon world compared to continental Europe (I&apos;m talking about stepping in to help individuals here rather than banks!) Many migrants are from nations where there is no welfare state, so we plan for redundancy. We price it in. &quot;Let&apos;s dig a little deeper into my job. There is very little information asymmetry anymore. Everyone has the same Bloomberg terminal, same market feed and (nearly) the same variant of the &quot;Black-Scholes&quot; model for pricing options. Making small margins on each trade is critical. &quot;The &quot;algos&quot; or high frequency computers will always trade faster than a human can. Most of your systems are executing the quick, &quot;scalp&quot; trades for you \u2013 your human input is how you programme it to hedge your exposure, and at what level you choose to take on a block trade. &quot;If you are a market-maker you are obliged to continually make live quotes in a pre-specified range of options, over a range of strikes and expirations. In return for providing this liquidity we can receive a rebate from the exchange. &quot;Trading options is a reductionist activity: you condense the underlying instrument&apos;s price, the strike (exercise level), contract duration, prevailing market interest rates, stock borrowing rates, dividend expectations and volatility into two numbers \u2013 your bid price (where you are prepared to buy at) and your offer price (where you are prepared to sell at). The first three inputs I mentioned are all known \u2013 it&apos;s only really the volatility you&apos;re that unsure of. &quot;That&apos;s essentially what we&apos;re trading \u2013 volatility, hence our name \u2013 &quot;vol&quot; traders. You want to get as big a spread as possible on each trade \u2013 but if you quote too wide your prices won&apos;t be competitive and nobody will trade with you. You need to find a balance between getting execution and minimising your adverse selection probability (that&apos;s your chance of being &quot;picked off&quot; when the market moves uni-directionally). &quot;There are lots of parameters you need to monitor, and thus lots of ways you can make (and lose) money. Firstly I look at option &quot;greeks&quot; (first-order derivatives such as &quot;delta&quot;, &quot;vega&quot;, &quot;theta&quot; and &quot;rho&quot; and then second-order derivatives like &quot;gamma&quot;, &quot;vanna&quot; and &quot;charm&quot;). When you&apos;re trading &quot;vol&quot; (the annualised standard deviation of returns of the underlying instrument) you&apos;re hypothesising how much an instrument is going to move. You want to optimise your various ratios (gamma/theta) at different strikes to ensure that you have bought and sold optionality at good levels. &quot;Secondly, I want to make relative value trades between components in the same index or in the same business sector: eg how is volatility priced at the 25% delta put option in this French oil company versus the 25% downside in that Spanish oil company? Does it seem fair? Where has the spread been historically? How divergent are the skews in the volatility smile? How quickly have I noticed this? Can I trade? Have I been fast enough in identifying an anomaly and monetising it? If and when I do, it is back to dynamic hedging, responding to broker requests from our sales traders, coding and repricing in line with new market developments. Depending on how fast your systems are you can implement volatility arbitrage strategies too. It&apos;s like playing Gran Turismo but your gear changes on the controls are manual. Not automatic. &quot;Vanilla&quot; options are contracts giving you the right (but not obligation) to buy (call) or sell (put) an underlying stock, index future, commodity future or bond future at a particular level and at a particular (series of) moment(s). When the duration of an option contract runs out, it &quot;expires&quot;. When that particular &apos;expiration&apos; moment arrives, it&apos;s incredibly tense. One evening every month I&apos;d be like: &quot;Don&apos;t bother me because I&apos;ll just ignore you.&quot; Imagine having to analyse between seven and ten names between 5.30pm and 5.35pm and ensure that you hedge your &quot;delta&quot; exposure on each one. Those five minutes are the auction, where market participants determine the closing price. That affects if an option is &quot;in the money&quot; or &quot;out of the money&quot; \u2013 ie whether it will be exercised or not. &quot;Probably the most turbulent time was over the summer of 2011 when it was believed that Greece might default. For three days I just reserved one of my screens to show televised footage of Greek parliamentary votes \u2013 that was the market barometer at the time. &quot;You only saw buyers on the screens \u2013 people were too afraid to sell. But I am required to quote prices. I have to react fast enough to keep an offer price at a safe enough level. At times like that it&apos;s not about stocks anymore \u2013 what moves markets is macro news. All it takes is for the likes of Ben Bernanke (US Federal Reserve chairman) or Mario Draghi (ECB president) to be a little bit hesitant. &quot;Sometimes there&apos;s a deep sense of powerlessness. Suppose I have a short gamma position (ie I&apos;ve sold volatility) in an airline company. That company issues a profit warning at 8.58am and the options market only opens at 9.01am. I know that a profit warning means the price will dive (in general, the smaller the market capitaliaation, the bigger the drop), but there&apos;s nothing I can do in those three minutes but re-price my options, my term structure and put in some respectable bids so I can buy back option premium. Oh \u2013 and I need to sell some stocks fast to minimise the size of my &quot;long delta&quot; position I get from being short on options.&quot; \u2022 To comment on this interview, please visit the accompanying blogpost"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/23/merkel-forbes-powerful-women", "sentences": ["Apart from Clinton, there are 14 on the 2013 list who appeared on the inaugural list a decade ago: the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde (7), Sonia Gandhi (9), Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo (10), chatshow host Oprah Winfrey (13), UN administrator Helen Clark (21), ABC chief Anne Sweeney (24), Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascall (36), the Queen (40), Fidelity president Abigail Johnson (60), Ho Ching, chief executive of Singapore state investment firm Temasek (64), news anchor Diane Sawyer (73), JK Rowling (93) and Fox news anchor Great Van Susteren (97)."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-23T15:03:00Z", "title": "Forbes' most powerful women: Angela Merkel leads politician-heavy list", "tags": ["Forbes magazine", "Angela Merkel", "The Queen", "JK Rowling", "Hillary Clinton", "Beyonc\u00e9", "Media", "Magazines", "US news", "World news"], "article": "The Queen and JK Rowling are once again the only two British women to feature in the Forbes Most Powerful Women list, which has been led by Angela Merkel for the third year running.

The Queen dropped from 26 to 40 on the 2013 list, while the Harry Potter author JK Rowling slipped from 78 to 93. The list was heavy on top politicians, featuring nine heads of state who run nations with a combined GDP of $11.8tn. Merkel \u2013 who has been placed at the top of the Forbes ranking seven times \u2013 headed the list again, ahead of Rousseff, who came to power in Brazil in 2011. Hillary Clinton, who has featured in every Most Powerful Women list since the inaugural ranking in 2004, is in fifth place. Despite resigning as secretary of state earlier this year, Clinton remains one of the biggest political hitters on the international stage. The only former first lady to become a US senator, she is now hotly tipped to become the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. Clinton was one place behind the woman already in the White House, First Lady Michelle Obama, who climbed three places to reach fourth. Apart from Clinton, there are 14 on the 2013 list who appeared on the inaugural list a decade ago: the head of the IMF, Christine Lagarde (7), Sonia Gandhi (9), Indra Nooyi, the chief executive of PepsiCo (10), chatshow host Oprah Winfrey (13), UN administrator Helen Clark (21), ABC chief Anne Sweeney (24), Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascall (36), the Queen (40), Fidelity president Abigail Johnson (60), Ho Ching, chief executive of Singapore state investment firm Temasek (64), news anchor Diane Sawyer (73), JK Rowling (93) and Fox news anchor Great Van Susteren (97). The list features 24 corporate chief executives in control of $893bn in revenues, 16 of them founders of their own companies, including two of the three new billionaires to the list, Tory Burch and Spanx&apos;s Sara Blakely. The 14 billionaires featured in the list are valued at more than $82bn, according to Forbes. Among the world&apos;s most powerful women are Africa&apos;s first female head of state, Liberia&apos;s Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first woman chief executive of at IBM, Ginni Rometty, and the first president of an Ivy League and of the Rockefeller Foundation, Judith Rodin. Providing both light entertainment and philanthropy, Angelina Jolie (37), Shakira (52), Gisele Bundchen (95) and Beyonc\u00e9 (17) were all recognised for their charity work. There was a strong showing for women in Asia. Park Geun-hye, the South Korean president, comes in at 11, while Burma&apos;s pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was at 29. After showing her mettle in the Australian parliament - where she gave the leader of the opposition a dusting-down and accused him of sexism \u2013 Australian PM Julia Gillard featured just behind in 28th position, with Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra at 31. Asian entrepreneurs Zhang Xin (50), Sun Yafang (77) and Solina Chau (80) all made the list, as did Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, India&apos;s first biotech entrepreneur.

The warning has come from one of the sport&apos;s biggest players, Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren team principal who is also chairman of the Formula One Teams&apos; Association, on the eve of the Monaco Grand Prix. The teams, who are absorbing the terms of the next Concorde Agreement, are already angry that the private equity firm CVC Capital, who hold a controlling stake in F1, take out more than half of the sport&apos;s $1.5bn income. With so much money going out, the teams cannot cope with rising costs and Bob Fernley, Force India&apos;s deputy team principal, claimed that CVC are &quot;the worst thing that had happened to the sport.&quot; The 11 teams pay a fortune to be involved in Formula One. The smallest, Marussia, has an estimated budget of $65m and that goes up to about $250m for Red Bull, who won last year&apos;s constructors&apos; championship. Now they have to come to terms with rocketing costs to cover new engines that will be introduced next year, a hike in entry fees to the FIA, the sport&apos;s governing body, and a new in-season testing initiative that is due to be approved next month. Whitmarsh said the situation &quot;really is a threat to the sport,&quot; and added: &quot;Formula One works best in a crisis but it is a shame that we have to create a crisis to deal with. This sport needs 10 or 11 teams and we should fight to keep the 11 teams we have now. But we are not good at doing these things. We seem to drop the ball. I fear that we will have a crisis and then we will have to get real and sort it out. I cannot see in their shoes [the seven smaller teams] how you can construct a sustainable business model.&quot; These seven teams are already incensed that most of the money goes to the four biggest operations, Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren. CVC are scheduled to increase payments to the teams from 47.5% to 60% of the sport&apos;s income \u2013 but the extra money will go to the big four. Fernley said: &quot;There should be a more equitable distribution. It&apos;s quite right that Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes get recognition. I would like to see Red Bull recognised in 20 years&apos; time but not after five years of pumping money into the sport.&quot; To make matters worse, teams complain that there is a lack of leadership from the FIA while Bernie Ecclestone, the sport&apos;s chief executive and commercial rights holder, faces the possibility of prosecution over allegations that he paid a $44m (\u00a329m) bribe to a German banker. Ecclestone, who will be 83 in October, already faced an uncertain future and CVC are believed to have drawn up a short list of names to succeed him. If he is charged, it could potentially jeopardise the planned $12bn (\u00a37.9bn) flotation on the Singapore stock exchange later this year. But it is the spiralling costs which have focused the teams&apos; attention. Between them, them will have to find $2bn over the seven years of the three-cornered Concorde Agreement, which will tie them to Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone and the international racing authority, the FIA. The biggest bill is for engines, as Formula One moves from the 2.4-litre V8s to 1.6-litre V6 units in 2014. It is understood that each team will have to find an extra $15m per season. Over seven seasons, and multiplied by the 11 teams, that comes to $1.155bn. Whitmarsh said: &quot;What is frightening is that we have adopted important new engine regulations. They are the right thing to do in many regards. They are technologically interesting and relevant to society. But F1 badly mismanaged the cost of the development and supply of those new power plants. We allowed the engineers to be unfettered in dreaming up the regulations, which means teams are now facing big bills. We got costs down to \u00a310m and now we are talking about double that. That is with all the other cost challenges we have.&quot; Those challenges include the FIA&apos;s move to permit in-season testing, which would cost the teams $770m over the new agreement. The FIA are also putting up their team entry and driver super licence fees by $7m a year \u2013 or $49m over seven years. Whitmarsh said: &quot;In addition, under the new agreement, the teams will to pay Pirelli $105m over the seven years.&quot; Fernley added: &quot;Everything we&apos;re doing at the moment is about increasing costs. There is no initiative at all about reducing costs. If we don&apos;t sit down and address it very carefully we&apos;re going to lose teams. &quot;I think all teams are struggling. You would be surprised by how high up they are. We should never underestimate the resolve of Formula One teams. But it will be tougher and tougher. &quot;If we do in-season testing that will be a massive increase. But look at our basic operations. Do we really need to be running wind tunnels 24/7?&quot; He reserved his most scathing remarks for CVC. &quot;I think CVC have done an absolutely awful job. In my view they are the worst thing that has ever happened to Formula One.&quot; Inevitably, the smaller teams are most vulnerable. Graeme Lowdon, the chief executive of Marussia, said: &quot;Sharp fluctuations in revenues and increasing costs is a recipe for serious trouble. If there are no constraints, it becomes an exercise in profligate spending.&quot; CVC refused to comment on Fernley&apos;s claims but a FIA spokesman said of the concerns over costs: &quot;The FIA has supported the resource restriction agreement but that failed because the teams could not agree. The FIA would still like to help teams to cut their costs. However, it cannot intervene in the discussion on the costs of the new engines. That is between the constructors and their customers. On entry fees, any organisation charges a fee that helps pay for the event. Entry fees had not risen in a long time and they have been revised to keep pace.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/may/25/art-hongkong-asia", "sentences": ["Several British dealers said that Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines, which are more familiar with western culture, were their most important markets in Asia."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-25T14:18:29Z", "title": "Art Basel fair woos wealthy Chinese with champagne, logos and singers", "tags": ["Art", "The art market", "Asia Pacific", "Hong Kong", "World news", "China", "Singapore", "Jake and Dinos Chapman"], "article": "The branding hits as soon as you leave Hong Kong International airport and spot two huge billboards heralding the Asian debut of the world&apos;s most prominent art fair, Art Basel. Amid a PR frenzy that drew the likes of supermodel Kate Moss and Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, it seemed that even the torrential rain and 18,000 lightning strikes across the territory hours before the VIP preview on Wednesday were just part of the city-wide spectacle. There is much familiar about Art Basel in Hong Kong, which runs alongside the original fair in its namesake home city in Switzerland and a sister event in Miami Beach \u2013 not least the sponsors. Trolleys of Ruinart champagne stalk the aisles at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. A BMW &quot;art car&quot; brightly painted by Spanish artist C\u00e9sar Manrique is displayed outside one entrance. Absolut ArtBureau, an offshoot of the vodka drink company, has commissioned an &quot;art bar&quot; by Adrian Wong, in which a Cantonese lounge singer performs with an animatronic band of multi-limbed manga-like creatures, evoking a mix of colonial kitsch and Blade Runner.      Art Basel&apos;s purchase of the previous Art HK fair two years ago led some locals to question whether Hong Kong&apos;s art scene was becoming a post-colonial venture for importing western art into Asia. With China now the world&apos;s second-largest art market after the US, and Asia home to more billionaires than North America, the attraction seems obvious. In recent years, several top commercial western galleries have set up outposts amid the Louis Vuitton and Prada stores in the city&apos;s central business district, including American Larry Gagosian, the world&apos;s richest art dealer, in 2008 and London gallerist Jay Jopling&apos;s White Cube in March 2012. At packed-out private views, both galleries brought out their big guns. White Cube showed the Chapman Brothers&apos; macabre new installation, The Sum of All Evil, vitrines packed with thousands of miniature figures in violent torment; and Gagosian presented paintings by the late New York graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. But the wooing of the Chinese collectors and their vast wealth is a long, slow process. Most western galleries have yet to convince the big buyers of mainland China, whose taste for contemporary art remains patriotic, according to market analysts. Graham Steele, director of White Cube Hong Kong, said: &quot;The barriers are coming down, but not as fast as western dealers would like them to. There isn&apos;t the cultural momentum yet. The major Chinese collectors come to Hong Kong for Christie&apos;s or Sotheby&apos;s auctions of Chinese art.&quot; US gallery Pace&apos;s Beijing branch, which explicitly declares itself an Asian gallery and runs a different programme from the US and UK branches, has found success by becoming a major dealer for Chinese contemporary artists. Its stand at the fair included work by Zhang Xiaogang, whose paintings have fetched multimillion-pound prices at auction. Several British dealers said that Singapore, Taiwan and the Philippines, which are more familiar with western culture, were their most important markets in Asia. Australians are also major collectors. Ellie Harrison-Read, sales associate at Lisson Gallery, said: &quot;Big names such as Anish Kapoor and Marina Abramovic, people who are familiar, sell well. Brand is very important here.&quot; This seemed to be apparent in big sales of the fair&apos;s first day. London&apos;s Victoria Miro gallery sold a wall-sized painting by Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama for \u00a31.32m and White Cube sold a Gary Hume sculpture for \u00a366,243, while 15 sculptures by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, depicting a cartoon version of the artist and his dog, sold for \u00a389,428 each. The local art scene, which has long felt overshadowed by the Chinese contemporary art boom, has mixed feelings about the influx of international dealers. Pui Pui To, director of 2P gallery, one of Hong Kong&apos;s few art spaces to represent local artists, said: &quot;Now that the blue chip galleries have arrived, it&apos;s become much tougher for us to survive.&quot; Spiralling rents have pushed younger galleries further from the city centre. Pui Pui To&apos;s gallery, which is showing in Art Basel, is on a backstreet in Sai Ying Pun in the city&apos;s western district. &quot;The only brand names round here are McDonald&apos;s and KFC,&quot; she said. However, she praised Art Basel in Hong Kong&apos;s director, Magnus Renfrew, who founded Art HK for supporting the local art scene through educational programmes and collaboration with non-profit, artist-run projects. Renfrew said that when he first arrived in Hong Kong it was referred to as a &quot;cultural desert&quot; with little audience for contemporary art: &quot;Since the fair opened, the number of visitors has grown from just 19,000 in 2008 to 67,000 last year and the gallery scene is more sophisticated.&quot; He believes that the current imbalance between the art market, which has long had a big presence in the territory with Christie&apos;s and Sotheby&apos;s auction houses, will change with the construction of the West Kowloon cultural district, which will include the M+ museum of visual culture, twice the size of Tate Modern, and 16 performing art museums. An outdoor exhibition of inflatable sculptures on the site, M+ mobile, which includes a giant upturned cockroach, a suckling pig you can walk into and British artist Jeremy Deller&apos;s bouncy castle version of Stonehenge, has drawn 130,000 visitors in just three weeks. Lars Nittve, executive director of M+ and the founding director of Tate Modern, compared the exhibition to the sensation caused by Carl Andre&apos;s bricks when they first were shown at the Tate. &quot;Really for the first time in Hong Kong it has provoked public debate about whether something that looks ugly can be art. Can you jump on art? Can art be fun?&quot; Harriet Onslow of Pearl Lam Galleries, based in Hong Kong and Shanghai, thinks there will be room for a wider range of galleries as the art scene diversifies. &quot;Collectors are not going to decide against buying one of [the smaller galleries&apos;] artists for HK$5,000 just because I&apos;ve sold them something for HK$200,000,&quot; she said. However the work of one of the local artists in the Pearl Lam booth suggests that Pui Pui To is not alone in her ambivalance towards the internationalisation of Hong Kong&apos;s art scene. Tsang Kin-wah offers a tongue-in-cheek critique of the art fair system in a text installation in which scathing comments in vinyl lettering spread across the floor like the tentacles of an octopus: &quot;ANYONECANBEANARTISTTHEREFOREANYA$$HOLECANBEANARTIST ANYONECANBEACOLLECTORTHEREFOREANYA$$HOLECANBEACOLLECTOR CREATE$LUXURYARTCREATE$BIGMONEYCREATE$POWERCREATE$BIGMONEY CREATE$BIGNAMECREATE$FAMECREATE$POWER.&quot; Onslow said: &quot;It&apos;s about how fucking awful art fairs are and how it&apos;s no longer about the art but the fair. The text is etched on glass because that signifies how the art and the artist is disappearing.&quot; Yet in the Deutsche Bank&apos;s exclusive VIP room another work by the artist, best known for painting words in English and Chinese in seemingly floral patterns, offers a more positive if rather cynical take, with the phrase &quot;Making Art, Making Money&quot; discernible in the grey text. It seems unlikely that Tsang Kin-wah at least will be disappearing any time soon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/may/26/british-airways-flights-cancelled", "sentences": ["We booked British Airways flights to Melbourne via Singapore and paid extra for better seats in premium economy.", "BA later informed us that the flights between Singapore and Melbourne had been cancelled and that on the return leg we had been booked on to a different flight departing Melbourne nearly four hours earlier than planned."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-26T06:00:09Z", "title": "Our superior premium flight tickets were brought down  to earth by BA", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Money", "British Airways", "Business"], "article": "We booked British Airways flights to Melbourne via Singapore and paid extra for better seats in premium economy. BA later informed us that the flights between Singapore and Melbourne had been cancelled and that on the return leg we had been booked on to a different flight departing Melbourne nearly four hours earlier than planned.  This was a problem because we were flying into Melbourne from Sydney that morning and our connecting flight would arrive too late for the new departure time. BA therefore transferred us onto a flight leaving the next day and implied that it would pay for our hotel and transportation costs. It turned out there was no premium economy class on the new flights. We wrote to BA&apos;s customer relations asking for our hotel costs, as well as a refund of the price difference between premium economy tickets and the economy seats we had been allocated. Customer relations referred us to customer support, which referred us back to customer relations. The latter told us that we were not entitled to hotel expenses and referred us back to customer support for the refund of the ticket price difference.

PT, London In earth-bound life, maybe, but different rules govern the skies. BA explains that there are many different fare classes across its cabins and some of them overlap. &quot;It is perfectly possible to find a slightly cheaper premium economy ticket compared to normal economy due to all the cheap economy fare classes having been sold, but cheap fare classes in premium being still available,&quot; says a spokesman. Moreover, although your flight number is a BA one, the Melbourne leg is on a Qantas aircraft, which does not have a premium economy class. The fare code you had paid, BA explains, is valid for economy class on Qantas. Even BA realises what nonsense this all sounds, so it has now decided to award you both \u00a3100 in travel or High Life shopping vouchers, probably in the hope of altering your resolve never to fly with it again. As for the hotel costs, EU regulations only entitle passengers to compensation if a flight is cancelled within 14 days of departure (yours was cancelled five months ahead) and, since the flight in question was outside the EU, this protection would not have applied in any case.

The water company will report full-year figures on Thursday and is likely to use the occasion as fuel for its argument that the initial offer \u2013 believed to be just under \u00a320 a share, or \u00a34.7bn in total \u2013 was too low. A meeting with the potential bidders two weeks ago lasted just 30 minutes. The consortium, which comprises the Canadian group Borealis Infrastructure Management, the Kuwait Investment Office and the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme, is expected to return with an increased offer but this is likely to fall short of the \u00a323 a share that some Severn Trent investors are said to be demanding. Emphasising its view that the company&apos;s fair value debt level is around \u00a34.8bn, the consortium is likely to pitch its new bid at about \u00a321 a share. Severn Trent closed on Friday at \u00a320.71, suggesting the market expects a new offer but not at a substantial premium to the previous terms. It is possible the bidders will unveil a new offer before Severn Trent&apos;s figures, but more likely that they will wait until after the results have been announced. The deadline for a decision is 11 June. The bidders may decide to approach the company&apos;s shareholders directly, but are unlikely to make a hostile move if the board rejects any upgraded bid. Tina Cook, an analyst at Charles Stanley, said: &quot;The share price level suggests that investors believe the consortium will return with an enriched offer before the deadline and not be deterred by the next regulatory price review (but this cannot be guaranteed).&quot; While some investors reportedly believe \u00a323 would reflect the scarcity value of the assets on offer \u2013 there are now only three listed UK water companies after a spate of acquisitions \u2013 the consortium points out there may also be a scarcity of buyers prepared to fund a bid of almost \u00a310bn including debt. The regulator Ofwat recently warned of the dangers to the water sector of bidders running up huge borrowings to fund takeovers. Utilities have been in demand for their steady cash flows and stable regulatory environment. But in common with the rest of the water sector, Severn Trent is three years into its latest five-year regulatory period, and the controls on the prices it charges to its 4.2 million household and business customers beyond then are yet to be determined. When the bid was revealed this month, Cook said: &quot;The timing of the potential deal is somewhat surprising in that it comes just ahead of the UK water sector&apos;s next regulatory price review 2015-20, which is currently under way and due to be finalised next year. This inevitably creates some mid-term risk across the sector.&quot; The company is expected to report a 1% rise in full-year profits to around \u00a3279m, with the benefits of regulatory price rises tempered by lower commercial volumes and higher costs. If a deal is agreed it will mark the swansong of the Severn Trent chief executive, Tony Wray, who is due to retire next spring. It would also mark an end to public life for a company formed in 1974 as a regional, publicly owned water authority based in Birmingham and providing services around two of Britain&apos;s largest rivers, the Severn and the Trent. Along with nine other regional businesses, it was privatised in 1989. Since then only Severn, United Utilities and Pennon have remained independent. Separately, reports over the weekend suggested that a 30% stake in Kelda, the owner of Yorkshire Water, could be up for sale for between \u00a31bn and \u00a31.5bn. Kelda is currently owned by a group of investors including Citigroup, HSBC, the Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Infracapital Partners. According to the Sunday Times, a number of international businesses such as the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund and Goldman Sachs are considering offers for the stake."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/27/la-liga-farewells-relegation-battle", "sentences": ["The newly crowned Copa del Rey winners had been partying for a week and flew off to Singapore to play a friendly in the build-up to this game, while the fans in the South Stand were as preoccupied with unfurling banners as they were with what was going on out on the pitch."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-27T14:53:32Z", "title": "La Liga witnesses plenty of farewells but basement battlers refuse to go | Sid Lowe", "tags": ["La Liga", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "It was a weekend of goodbyes but four teams refused to go, clinging on for dear life. Their grip may be slipping, fingers frantically clawing as the rubble slides past their bloodied nails and into the abyss below, but they haven&apos;t let go. Not yet, anyway. On the penultimate weekend only Osasuna scrambled to safety, while Granada were pulled clear by others. The rest are still there, touching the void. Next Saturday the final 10 games of the La Liga season will kick off at 9pm CET*. The champions are decided, second and third too, but we&apos;ve known that pretty much since Christmas. Below them the final Champions League place is still there to be claimed, a final European place too, while below them not one team is relegated yet. No, not one. Four clubs will fight it out for survival on the final day: Mallorca, Zaragoza, Celta and Deportivo. Three will be leaving. Others already have. The penultimate weekend of the season was about them, about farewells and festivities; a final curtain before their fans. Not that things always went as planned. The real business, the final judgment, will be left for week 38 as the Spanish season once again carries on beyond the Fifa cut-off point and into the summer. At Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, Espanyol paid homage to the team that reached the 1988 Uefa Cup final against Bayer Leverkusen and gave the obligatory guard of honour to the league champions, city rivals Barcelona. Espanyol&apos;s fans turned their backs in disgust and hoped they could ruin their rivals&apos; chances of reaching 100 points only for Alexis S\u00e1nchez and Pedro to clinch a 2-0 win that means if Barcelona beat M\u00e1laga next weekend at Camp Nou, they will equal the record set last year by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho&apos;s Madrid: the one the Portuguese coach said no one could take away from him. At the Rosaleda, Isco scored a belter on his last game before the M\u00e1laga fans and Manuel Pellegrini waved goodbye. A huge banner ran round the second tier declaring: &quot;thanks for everything&quot;. &quot;Engineer of our dreams&quot;, read another, and at the end of the game, which M\u00e1laga won 3-1, Pellegrini was presented with a plaque, while players and staff lined up to applaud him from the field. &quot;I could not have wished for a better send off,&quot; he said afterwards. &quot;I&apos;m not going because I want to; I&apos;m going because I have to. I have a number of good options \u2026 and Manchester is one of them.&quot; And up in Bilbao, the most emotional farewell of them all: Athletic played their last ever game at San Mam\u00e9s, a century after their first. Before the game, the captains came out together and laid a bunch of flowers in the centre of the pitch and there was applause for 100 seconds. A unique stadium where the liturgy is unlike anywhere else, the Cathedral bowed out sadly, though. Iker Muniain was sent off and Juanlu scored the ground&apos;s last ever goal in the 90th minute. Which might have been a nice finale but Juanlu plays for Levante and it meant that the 1,739th game there finished with Athletic&apos;s 268th defeat, the team whistled from the field. Then there was the Calder\u00f3n. And there, just like at the Rosaleda, the two worlds collided; the difference was that unlike M\u00e1laga with Depor, Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s party could have become Mallorca&apos;s funeral. For the second week in a row, Mallorca knew they could be mathematically relegated. According to the stats in AS, they had a 96% chance of being relegated. Yet there was hope: they had paid for 400 fans to travel to support the team and if ever there was a good time to play Atl\u00e9tico, this was probably it. The newly crowned Copa del Rey winners had been partying for a week and flew off to Singapore to play a friendly in the build-up to this game, while the fans in the South Stand were as preoccupied with unfurling banners as they were with what was going on out on the pitch. After all, they have waited a long time for the chance to laugh at their city neighbours. One declared the Bernab\u00e9u a bar where Atl\u00e9tico always get free drinks, or &quot;copas&quot;. &quot;We thought that there might be some relaxation and they might open up,&quot; Mallorca&apos;s coach, Gregorio Manzano, said. They could be forgiven for thinking that Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s attention might be elsewhere. &quot;It&apos;s not easy to focus,&quot; Diego Simeone admitted. Before the match 10 players representing 10 different Cup-winning sides came on to the pitch carrying their trophies \u2013 Collar from the 1960 side; Adelardo from 1961; Ufarte from 1965; Calleja from 1972; G\u00e1rate from 1976; Quique Ramos from 1985; Alfredo from 1991; Tom\u00e1s from 1992; and Soloz\u00e1bal from 1996 \u2013 and they were then joined by the current team. As they emerged from the tunnel, Mallorca stood and applauded. Until the last few minutes, it felt like they did much the same; that unique opportunity passed up. All the while the results came in, that sense of drama and interconnectedness destroyed by the league adopting 10 different time slots each weekend restored by making everyone kick off at the same time for the penultimate weekend. Celta, Mallorca, Zaragoza, Depor, Osasuna and Granada all hanging on each others&apos; results. After only 15 seconds, Rub\u00e9n Castro had scored for Betis and after 17 minutes so had Pab\u00f3n to make it 2-0. After 26 minutes, Celta were 1-0 up in Valladolid. After 45 minutes, Deportivo were a goal down in M\u00e1laga and after 49 Osasuna were a goal down against Sevilla. One minute after that, Betis made it 3-0. And six minutes after that Celta made it 2-0, Iago Aspas scoring a penalty. Three minutes later, Granada went 1-0 down to Valencia but it didn&apos;t matter: Zaragoza, on course for a 4-0 defeat, had seen them safe. So had Depor, 2-0 down four minutes later and 3-1 down by the final minute. At around the same time, Patxi Pu\u00f1al scored his first goal in five years to equalise against Sevilla. As the clock ticked up to 80 minutes, there were no teams down and five teams who could go down. But then Alvaro Cejudo scored again for Osasuna, keeping them in the first division for the 14th consecutive year. And all the while, at the Calder\u00f3n not much was happening. Mallorca were walking a knife-edge: concede and they were down. But still they did not react. Perhaps they were paralysed by the fear. &quot;When you know you can go down, that affects you,&quot; Manzano said. Worse, Atl\u00e9tico had started trying to score, finding space and chances. Radamel Falcao had a goal disallowed; clean through, the Colombian clipped a great chance over the bar; Mario Su\u00e1rez hit the post; Costa was pulled back when he was racing away; Adri\u00e1n hesitated when he might have been in. And then, suddenly, in the dying minutes, it nearly happened. Nearly but not quite. Gio dos Santos curled a free-kick just wide, pushed away by Thibaut Courtois, and Alan Hutton&apos;s ball across the face of the goal was agonisingly close. For the second week in a row, Mallorca had avoided relegation, but relegation was not letting go that easily. &quot;We have to believe in miracles,&quot; Manzano said afterwards, sadly failing to add: &quot;where are you from, you sexy thing&quot;. But Mallorca&apos;s players mostly departed the stadium in silence, Hutton amongst those refusing to talk, and Manzano was downbeat. That this was an opportunity lost was underlined by the fact that you could only just hear him above the noise. Thousands of Atl\u00e9tico supporters were still in the stadium almost an hour after the game, singing and chanting, demanding that the team come back out. Falcao obliged, climbing up the barrier at the front of the stand to bid farewell. &quot;Whatever Radamel does is fine by me,&quot; said Simeone, &quot;all I can say to him is: gracias.&quot; Mallorca are bottom on 33 points; Zaragoza have 34, Celta 34 and Deportivo 35. Only one of them will escape and only Depor&apos;s fate is entirely in their own hands. And yet while all four of them play at home, only Depor face someone with something to play for: Champions League-chasing Real Sociedad. Survival remains possible for teams who didn&apos;t expect to last this long. &quot;No one gave us a chance but we&apos;re still fighting,&quot; said Celta de Vigo&apos;s manager, Abel Resino. &quot;There are two Galician teams in trouble and only one will survive. We&apos;ll support Depor in the second division.&quot; As for Mallorca, they must now win and hope not only that Deportivo lose but that Celta and Zaragoza don&apos;t pick up more than a point. They have clung on this far but they know that they need other teams&apos; grips to slip. &quot;Mathematically nothing is lost but we know it is super difficult,&quot; Manzano said. &quot;You have to have hope, even when you have the smallest chance. We&apos;ve survived two weeks now, knowing that we could have been mathematically down. That comes as a relief and gives you a sense of having been resuscitated. We depend on others but first we must do our bit: imagine if we did not and then the other results go our way. We have to win and then wait. Strange things happen and we have survived on the final day before. Why not again?&quot; How the European battle stands going into the final day Real Sociedad, who battered Real Madrid but only drew 3-3, are two points behind Valencia for the last Champions League place, but have a better head-to-head record. They travel to Deportivo while Valencia go to Sevilla to face Unai Emery, the manager who took them to three successive third-place finishes. Betis, in seventh, go to Levante needing a solitary point to 100% guarantee European football. Not that the European situation is remotely clear: the final European place could be taken up by the team as low as ninth, thanks to Atl\u00e9tico winning the Cup and eighth-placed Rayo Vallecano and sixth-placed M\u00e1laga both being denied Uefa licences for next year, pending appeal. That means that Sevilla, Getafe and even Levante may still be in with a chance. Results: Espanyol 0-2 Barcelona, Athletic 0-1 Levante, Osasuna 2-1 Sevilla, Real Sociedad 3-3 Madrid, Getafe 1-2 Rayo, Atl\u00e9tico 0-0 Mallorca, Valladolid 0-2 Celta, M\u00e1laga 3-1 Deportivo, Betis 4-0 Zaragoza, Valencia 1-0 Granada. Next weekend&apos;s key games: Sevilla-Valencia, Depor-Real Sociedad, Celta-Espanyol, Mallorca-Valladolid, Zaragoza-Atl\u00e9tico. * Oh, wait \u2026 Madrid and Barcelona&apos;s games have just been changed to 5pm and 7pm respectively.

But France&apos;s love affair with electronic cigarettes could be about to hit a major stumbling block as the government considers banning them from all public places, including restaurants and bars. The battery-powered devices which let users inhale a vaporized liquid nicotine solution instead of tobacco smoke are the subject of a major medical report commissioned by the French health ministry and delivered on Tuesday. The nation of Gauloises and Gitanes is showing an ever-growing dependence on electronic cigarettes, which were first produced in China in 2004 and allow smokers to get a nicotine fix without exposing themselves or others to the toxins, tar and carbon monoxide in tobacco smoke. Industry statistics show at least 500,000 people smoke e-cigarettes in France but Bertrand Dautzenberg, the professor who led the report suggested there could already be as many as 1 million people using them in France. The market is reportedly worth \u20ac100m (\u00a385m) in France with around 150 specialist shops. The medical experts recommended that e-cigarettes should be subject to the same restrictions as tobacco in France and therefore &quot;banned from all the places where smoking is banned.&quot; France outlawed smoking in the workplace, including bars and restaurants, over the course of 2007 and 2008. Doctors also want the sale of e-cigarettes to under-18s to be banned, warning that the electronic devices could be &quot;a potential gateway to smoking tobacco.&quot; A recent study in Paris found that 64% of teenagers aged between 12 and 14 who had tried an electronic cigarette had not yet smoked a real one. A growing number of UK secondary schools have reportedly begun to ban e-cigarettes over fears they lead to smoking tobacco. Other recommendations in the French report include enforcing the same advertising rules on electronic cigarettes as regular cigarettes, warning against their use by pregnant or breastfeeding women and allowing them only to be sold at approved places. Manufacturers would have to make the case scientifically that the ingredients used are harmless. Although e-cigarettes are considered safer than smoking, doctors continue to debate the possible impact of some of the vapours&apos; ingredients \u2013 including propylene glycol, which irritates airways, and formaldehyde, which is known to raise lung and nasal cancer risk. Doctors argue more research is needed. Countries including Turkey, Brazil, Argentina and Singapore have outlawed e-cigarettes. Last year, France&apos;s state auditor warned that successive efforts to curb smoking, from the 1991 law that bars and restaurants had to have smoke-free areas to the 2007 ban on smoking in the workplace, have not succeeded in making the nation cut down. The number of smokers fell from 34% to 31% between 2000 and 2005 but rose again to more than 33% by 2010. Women, young people and those in financial difficulty showed the highest rise in smoking. About 73,000 tobacco-related deaths are reported in France each year. The state auditor has said that only major price-increases would curb French smoking habits."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/may/28/obama-chinese-president-cyber-attacks", "sentences": ["Cyber security will also be discussed at a meeting in Singapore this weekend of defence ministers and officials, including US defence secretary Chuck Hagel."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-28T18:02:00Z", "title": "Obama to confront Chinese president over spate of cyber-attacks on US", "tags": ["Cybercrime", "Barack Obama", "China", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Technology", "World news", "California", "Xi Jinping"], "article": "Barack Obama will confront Chinese president Xi Jinping next week over a spate of cyber-attacks on the US, including the latest allegation that Chinese hackers gained access to more than two dozen of America&apos;s most advanced weapons systems.

A leaked copy was published by the Washington Post on Tuesday.  Access to the designs would allow China to catch up on years of military development and save it billions of dollars. It would also make it easier for China to develop weapons to counter US systems. The Defence Science Board report comes amid a spate of accusations worldwide claiming Beijing is engaged in a sustained campaign of hacking defence and business secrets. In a separate row, Chinese hackers are alleged to have stolen the blueprints for Australia&apos;s new spy headquarters. Asked on Tuesday about the alleged hacking of secret military projects, White House spokesman Jay Carney said cyber security would be discussed by the two leaders when they meet at the US-China summit on June 7 and 8. He declined to comment directly on the Defence Science Board report but said cyber issues were a key concern for the US. The summit, at a private estate in southern California, is the first between the two since Xi was promoted to president and since Obama&apos;s re-election and comes at a time of friction between the two countries. The White House national security adviser Tom Donilon, who is in Beijing for discussions with Chinese officials about the summit, has warned that cyber-attacks could jeopardise relations between the two countries. Dean Cheng, a China specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington, said the summit &quot;offers an opportunity to make clear to Beijing the serious consequences of its cyber activities. The question is whether the Obama administration will seize it.&quot; A broad warning about cyber-security contained in the Defence Science Report was published in January but the details about military programmes alleged to have been hacked remained classified. Projects named in the report include: the advanced Patriot missile system, the PAC-3;the F/A-18 fighter jet; the Littoral Combat Ship intended for use close to shore, and anti-ballistic missile system, the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence. The Patriot missile system offers the main defence against missile attacks on Europe, Israel, the Persian Gulf and US allies in Asia. The report does not blame the Chinese government, only Chinese hackers. In a CBS interview, Winslow Wheeler, who monitors defence spending at the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington think-tank, described the projects as the US military&apos;s &quot;family jewels&quot;. Cyber security will also be discussed at a meeting in Singapore this weekend of defence ministers and officials, including US defence secretary Chuck Hagel."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/28/australian-companies-forced-disclose-tax", "sentences": ["He said Apple had told his committee that prices were set by the US parent and &quot;Apple overseas&quot;, but the US committee heard Apple&apos;s Australian prices were &quot;determined by Apple Singapore&quot;.", "When they arrived, ASI sold the products to Apple Singapore at a substantial profit.", "Apple Singapore then resold the products, in turn, to Apple retail entities or end customers \u2026 Transferring title in this manner allowed Apple to retain most of its profits in Ireland, where it has negotiated a favourable tax rate and maintains entities claiming to have no tax residence in any country, and limit the income it reported in the non-tax haven countries.&quot; King also told Australia&apos;s house of representatives infrastructure and communications committee on 22 March there were reasons Apple&apos;s prices were sometimes higher here."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-28T21:15:00Z", "title": "Apple may have misled Australians over how it sets prices, says MP", "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics", "Apple"], "article": "Apple may have &quot;deliberately or accidentally&quot; misled Australians about how it sets prices here and should &quot;correct the record or provide further detail&quot;, a Labor backbencher has demanded. Backbencher Ed Husic, who has taken a leading role in an Australian parliamentary committee into IT pricing, said shock revelations from a US Senate committee raised concerns &quot;the Australian inquiry has been misled, either deliberately or accidentally&quot;. &quot;I&apos;d call on Apple Australia to either correct the record or provide further detail as to the way it actually prices its products for Australian consumers,&quot; Husic told the House of Representatives. Husic said people may have &quot;raised an eyebrow&quot; at reports that Apple generated $6bn in revenue in Australia but &quot;paid only $40m in tax \u2013 apparently because it racked up $5.5bn in costs&quot;, but &quot;their eyes would&apos;ve popped out&quot; at the US revelations Apple had set up an offshore subsidiary that earned $30bn income but had apparently paid no tax to any government for five years. And the two committee investigations were related, because Apple&apos;s complicated international structure has an impact on the prices paid for Apple products for Australians. He said Apple had told his committee that prices were set by the US parent and &quot;Apple overseas&quot;, but the US committee heard Apple&apos;s Australian prices were &quot;determined by Apple Singapore&quot;. &quot;The corporate structure detailed in the US Senate report was never offered by Apple Australia and when pressed on its transfer pricing or price setting. I put it to the house that Apple deliberately avoided setting out the detail that became evident in the US report,&quot; Husic told the House of Representatives. The assistant treasurer, David Bradbury, has also reacted angrily to revelations about Apple&apos;s taxation arrangements to the US Senate committee, telling Guardian Australia that Australians had reason to be &quot;doubly infuriated&quot; with Apple because the company set up complicated structures to avoid taxation and also charged Australians higher prices for its popular products. Bradbury said he had been &quot;astonished to learn that a company like Apple could record income on this scale and have no home for tax purposes&quot;. He added: &quot;I had heard of profit shifting to other jurisdictions but this is shifting profits into the ether.&quot; Apple has a 10-year old &quot;advance pricing agreement&quot; with the Australian Taxation Office covering the &quot;the transfer pricing method&quot; it has used. In its 12 April letter to the Australian parliamentary committee, Apple confirmed this agreement was &quot;in the process of renewal&quot;. Asked for a response to Husic&apos;s remarks, a spokeswoman for Apple referred Guardian Australia to the Apple Australia chief executive, Tony King&apos;s recent evidence to the parliamentary committee. King told the committee: &quot;We pay our taxes when they are due \u2013 not only income tax expense but GST, payroll, FBT and any other tax that might be incurred in doing business in Australia.&quot; He explained that Apple&apos;s Australian subsidiary Apple Pty Ltd reported revenue and costs and paid tax on its net profit. But the US Senate committee reported on the procedure used by Apple for products sold in Asia, including to Australia. According to the report from the US permanent subcommittee on investigations, an Irish-affiliate company, Apple Sales International, &quot;took title to the manufactured products while they were being shipped to Apple&apos;s Asian distribution centres. When they arrived, ASI sold the products to Apple Singapore at a substantial profit. Apple Singapore then resold the products, in turn, to Apple retail entities or end customers \u2026 Transferring title in this manner allowed Apple to retain most of its profits in Ireland, where it has negotiated a favourable tax rate and maintains entities claiming to have no tax residence in any country, and limit the income it reported in the non-tax haven countries.&quot; King also told Australia&apos;s house of representatives infrastructure and communications committee on 22 March there were reasons Apple&apos;s prices were sometimes higher here. He said: &quot;When comparing prices it is important to remember that the US retail prices do not include sales tax. Here in Australia, of course, a price includes a 10% GST. That fact alone is responsible for a great deal of confusion and has resulted in some inaccurate conclusions regarding our pricing.&quot; He said Apple also had to &quot;consider differences between countries in product costs, freight charges, local sales taxes, levies, import duties, channel economics, competition and local laws regarding advertised prices&quot; and pointed out Apple was also unable to adjust its prices every time currency exchange rates fluctuated. The angry response to revelations about Apple&apos;s tax structure comes as a bill to force Australia&apos;s 2,000 biggest companies to publicly disclose how much tax they pay is introduced into federal parliament on Wednesday. It also follows a new report, Secrecy Jurisdictions, the ASX and Public Transparency, which showed that as of April 2011, 61 of Australia&apos;s top 100 companies held subsidiaries in &apos;&apos;secrecy jurisdictions&apos;&apos; that had been targeted by tax authorities \u2013 at least some of them with little evidence of actual commercial activity. Many companies covered by the proposed new law \u2013 those with total income over $100m \u2013 do report their tax, but, according to the government, many others do not, or report it in a way that does not clearly disclose what they actually pay. Mark Zimsak, of the Uniting Church&apos;s Justice and International Mission unit, which released the &quot;Secrecy Jurisdictions&quot; report, said the new law would &quot;at least help us know what tax companies pay in Australia&quot;. But he said it &quot;did not differentiate which companies were profit shifting and which were claiming legitimate deductions&quot;. In a submission to the Treasury about the proposed law, the Corporate Tax Association said it would not &quot;enable the community to draw informed conclusions about whether or not any particular company is paying its &apos;fair share&apos; of tax, whatever that means&quot; and would require data to be provided in a way that could be misinterpreted."}, {"webUrl":

Amazon continues to face questions about its company structures after it was revealed that it pays meagre amounts of tax in the UK on sales of up to \u00a34.2bn. The OECD secretary general, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, said that rewriting international tax rules had become one of the great challenges for finance ministers as many of the old frameworks had become irrelevant. &quot;The [international tax] rules which we have built since the 1920s were meant to avoid double taxation \u2026 the problem is we&apos;ve moved from double taxation to double non-taxation. &quot;Now we don&apos;t tax anybody because we&apos;ve built a set of codes and regulations and law \u2026 and culture \u2026 where we facilitate the fact that co-operations, through transfer pricing practises, put their profits in low-tax jurisdictions and therefore do not pay what would be considered to be their fair share.&quot; He said that taxing IT companies such as Google and Amazon had become especially difficult as they were based in the &quot;ether&quot;. &quot;You can move anywhere and it doesn&apos;t matter where you originate the information or where you register the company, basically the consistency is that they [the companies] want to pay less tax.&quot; Gurr\u00eda, who works closely with finance minsters in dozens of countries, spoke frankly about how the financial crises had precipitated a new era of tax co-operation.

The China Iron &amp; Steel Association and one of its largest members, Jiangsu Shagang, believe benchmark numbers may be unreliable because they are based on a small number of transactions. &quot;We are sceptical because we don&apos;t know the size of the deal samples and how they work out the indexed prices,&quot; Wang Liqun, deputy general secretary of the China Iron &amp; Steel Association, said in a phone interview with Bloomberg news agency. &quot;If the daily price is based only on one deal a day, can you trust it?&quot; Platts has recently been raided alongside BP and Shell by the European Commission as part of an investigation into alleged manipulation of the oil markets. The Financial Conduct Authority in London is also reviewing similar concerns raised about the gas sector amid wider fears about the methodology used by PRAs to assess prices. &quot;We found the indexes often dropped slower when the (iron ore) spot market falls, while it always rises quicker when the spot rates move up,&quot; Shen Wenming, vice president of Jiangsu Shagang Group, said in another interview with Bloomberg. &quot;Indexed pricing dominates the market. Steelmakers don&apos;t have a say but to follow.&quot; The price of iron ore was for decades set through annual negotiations behind-closed-doors between the large iron ore producers, such as BHP Billiton, Vale and Rio Tinto, plus the large Japanese and Chinese steel makers. But the mining companies have since 2010 been increasingly successful pushing for big contracts to be linked to spot market rates set via benchmarks provided by Platts, an arm of US-based publisher, McGraw Hill, or rivals such as British-based Metal Bulletin. New Asian price reporting agencies have also been established including one run by China Beijing International Mining Exchange and Singapore&apos;s GlobalORE. One mining company said Platts and others had brought a lot more transparency to the iron ore market although it recognised that the prices would have stronger credibility if they were based on a wider number of transactions. Some buyers and sellers currently do not cooperate with the PRAs and choose to keep their deals confidential. A spokeswoman for Platts said: &quot;The quality of the information we obtain is key and we have emphasised transactions, bids and offers that are verifiable, transparent and firm.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/may/30/media-briefing-thursday-30-may", "sentences": ["P36 i News website licensing in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-30T08:22:13Z", "title": "Today's media stories from the papers", "tags": ["Media"], "article": "Top eight stories on MediaGuardian     Shaun the Sheep Photograph: BBC/Aardman Animations    Netflix boss: BBC holding back UK kids&apos; shows Ted Sarandos says corporation restricts UK licensing for up to five years, forcing streaming service to buy US shows instead Eric Holder accused over leaks investigation Embattled attorney general seized on by Republican critics as fresh information emerges about attempts to obtain emails Anjem Choudary row sparks censorship debate Anti-terror law reviewer David Anderson QC says broadcasters should decide whether to show radicals on their channels Netflix shares fall after mixed Arrested Development reviews Internet streaming company spent $200m on the high-profile original series but it&apos;s too early to tell if gamble will pay off Murdoch signals fresh start with News Corp logo \u2013 but his hand is all over it Mark Sinclair: The new branding for the mogul&apos;s publishing arm is a stab at being more informal, but in reality it sticks to the same old script Facebook backs campaign against hate speech Company agrees to update policies in response to protest by more than 100 advocacy groups Thomson Reuters hires Economist Group chief Andrew Rashbass to leave publisher after 15 years, having led digital transformation from print to digital business Bad subtitles: share your photos Is the media watchdog right to crack down on TV subtitling?

In a boost for the latter&apos;s troubled Dreamliner programme, Singapore has placed an order to secure the first 30 of the next generation Boeing 787s, the 787-10X. The deal is dependent on Boeing itself deciding to proceed with manufacturing the plane, a slightly larger version of the current model with more seats and cargo space. Meanwhile, the airline has placed firm orders for 30 A350-900s from Airbus, to be delivered in 2016-17, with options for 20 more planes \u2013 potentially upgrading these to the larger A350-1000 model. Some will be used to replace the existing craft but the order represents some likely fleet expansion. The order is seen as reaffirming Singapore&apos;s commitment to the premium medium- and long-haul market, where it has faced increasing competition from the Gulf carriers, after it launched a low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, in 2011. The Singapore Airlines chief executive, Goh Choon Phong, said: &quot;Today&apos;s aircraft orders are among the biggest in Singapore Airlines&apos; history, helping to ensure that we retain our industry-leading position.

However, the project has been on ice as Boeing struggled to return its pioneering plane to the sky after recurring battery fires saw the entire worldwide fleet grounded earlier this year. Singapore has a record as an early adopter, having been the first airline to fly the Airbus A380, the world&apos;s largest passenger aircraft.

The aviation consultant John Strickland said: &quot;Singapore has had a significant part of its fleet made up of more expensive, four-engine aircraft which are too big for some routes. These orders will reduce average capacity while putting it back in the leading edge of new-generation long-range twin jets which will offer superb operating economics without excess numbers of seats. This, combined with its legendary service reputation, should allow it to recover profitability and market share.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/31/vodafone-burma-withdrawal", "sentences": ["France Telecom, Qatar Telecom, Singapore&apos;s Singtel and Norway&apos;s Telenor Group remain in the running, as does a consortium which brings together Soros, Digicel and Burmese property and financial services magnate Serge Pun."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T17:24:04Z", "title": "Vodafone drops out of Burma bidding race", "tags": ["Vodafone", "Telecommunications industry", "Business", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Myanmar"], "article": "Vodafone has withdrawn from the race to become the first foreign mobile phone network in Burma, citing commercial reasons. The exit of Vodafone and its partner China Mobile in advance of Monday&apos;s deadline for final bid submissions leaves the field clear to 11 others, including the currency speculator George Soros, who has teamed up with Irish telecoms entrepreneur Denis O&apos;Brien. Campaign groups have warned companies against doing business in newly liberalised Burma before the country relaxes its controls on access to information and freedom of expression. Under laws enacted by the former military government, anyone in Burma owning a fax machine or modem or setting up a computer network requires a licence. The government can penalise citizens who &quot;spread false news&quot; or publish anything on the internet compromising national security. Vodafone said it had withdrawn after seeing the final licence conditions, which were published on 20 May, because &quot;the opportunity does not meet the strict internal investment criteria to which both Vodafone and China Mobile adhere&quot;. A spokeswoman for Vodafone added that among the British company&apos;s concerns were that a promised telecommunications bill overhauling regulation of the sector is now not due to be enacted before Burma finalises its choice of foreign mobile operator on 27 June. In 2011, Vodafone suffered a backlash after being ordered to comply with the shut down of Egypt&apos;s communications network during the revolution that led to the overthrow of president Hosni Mubarak. Burma took similar measures in 2007, closing down internet connections during a popular uprising. Human Rights Watch has been lobbying telecoms companies to boycott Burma until legislation is improved. It has warned that far from improving freedom of expression, a draft of the telecommunications bill seen by its officers in March could make matters worse by co-opting foreign companies into censorship and surveillance. &quot;Right now there are no protections for privacy or safeguards against the kind of internet shutdown that happened in 2007,&quot; said Cynthia Wong of Human Rights Watch. &quot;Telecom operators entering Burma simply don&apos;t know whether they will be required to help the government censor or illegally monitor users.&quot; Burma, renamed Myanmar by the military government, is tendering contracts to build and operate two nationwide networks. As a nation of 64 million people, fewer than 10% of whom have a mobile phone, Burma represents the world&apos;s largest untapped telecoms market. France Telecom, Qatar Telecom, Singapore&apos;s Singtel and Norway&apos;s Telenor Group remain in the running, as does a consortium which brings together Soros, Digicel and Burmese property and financial services magnate Serge Pun. Via his charity, the Open Society Foundation, Soros donates $2m (\u00a31.31m) a year to Burma, mostly for education projects. Digicel, whose operations are currently confined to the Caribbean and some Pacific Islands, has already made a splash in Burma, sponsoring the national football federation, signing up partners for retail outlets and negotiating land deals for thousands of mast sites. If it wins, Digicel will be ready to roll out a network within months. &quot;Vodafone and China Mobile will continue to watch Myanmar&apos;s progress with interest and will give due consideration to any future opportunities that would meet the companies&apos; investment criteria,&quot; the firms stated."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/01/chuck-hagel-rebuke-chinese-general", "sentences": ["In a speech at a high-profile security conference in Singapore, Hagel said the US administration has concerns about &quot;the growing threat of cyberintrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-01T17:00:30Z", "title": "Chuck Hagel rebuked by Chinese general over US buildup in Asia", "tags": ["US foreign policy", "Chuck Hagel", "US military", "US news", "Singapore", "China", "Hacking", "Barack Obama", "Xi Jinping"], "article": "US defence secretary Chuck Hagel was challenged by a Chinese general Saturday to better explain the US military&apos;s Asia pivot, just moments after the Pentagon chief warned Beijing over cyberwarfare.

She said the Obama administration&apos;s new focus on the Pacific has been widely interpreted as an &quot;attempt to counter China&apos;s rising influence and to offset the increasing military capabilities of the Chinese PLA. However, China is not convinced.&quot; In pointed remarks, she asked Hagel how he can assure China that the increased US deployments to the region are part of an effort to build a more positive relationship with Beijing. &quot;That&apos;s really the whole point behind closer military-to-military relationships,&quot; Hagel responded. &quot;We don&apos;t want miscalculations and misunderstandings and misinterpretations. And the only way you do that is you talk to each other.&quot; The Pentagon chief said the US welcomed a strong and emerging China that takes on responsibilities for security in the region, adding that the two countries have to be inclusive and direct with each other. &quot;I think we&apos;ve made continued progress,&quot; he said. &quot;And we&apos;ll make more progress.&quot; The comments come ahead of a meeting next week in California between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping. It will be their first meeting since Obama&apos;s re-election and Xi&apos;s promotion to Communist Party chief.

The meetings, which will begin in July, are the first formal attempt to break the growing threat to cybersecurity posed by military-backed hacking operations. In recent weeks the US government has complained in increasingly shrill terms about breaches into some of the country&apos;s most sensitive infrastructure \u2013 including core military systems and new product development by many leading US businesses \u2013 by hackers thought to be based in Beijing and Shanghai. Cyberespionage is likely to be a prominent item on the agenda when President Obama hosts the new Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for a special summit in Rancho Mirage, California on Friday. The meeting, which is being billed as a getting-to-know-you exercise for the two presidents, is a reflection on the part of US officials that they see in Xi a politician who might have greater success than predecessors in reining in hackers attached to the Chinese military. Cries of foul-play have been dramatically stepped up in recent weeks by the US administration. Last week the Washington Post obtained confidential portions of a report for the Pentagon by the Defense Science Board that warned that Chinese hackers had cracked into the programs for many of the US military&apos;s most sensitive advanced weapons systems. Compromised designs included the advanced Patriot missile system, an Army system for intercepting ballistic missiles and the Navy Aegis ballistic-missile defence system. In addition, the security firm Mandiant has identified a unit of the People&apos;s Liberation based outside Shanghai as the source of more than 140 attacks on many of America&apos;s top institutions, including newspapers such as the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, political think tanks and major firms. China has repeatedly denied the allegations and countered that it sees US military build up in the Asia region \u2013 presented by the US as its &quot;new pivot to the Pacific&quot; \u2013 as a direct threat to its interests. Chinese commentators have also frequently pointed to Stuxnet, the computer worm that attacked Iran&apos;s nuclear programme in 2010 and is believed to have originated with the US working in tandem with Israel, as evidence that the US government is also capable of cyber aggression. Though Obama is expected to raise the issue directly with Xi on Friday at the 200-acre Sunnylands estate, the discussion is likely to tiptoe around the subject. Officials have told the New York Times that the most highly charged aspect of the allegations \u2013 that US military secrets are being stolen on a huge scale \u2013 will not be broached as military espionage is considered too hot to handle at this stage by both sides.

The countries &quot;appear determined to retain their nuclear arsenals indefinitely&quot;, says the latest yearbook published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). At the start of 2013, eight states \u2013 the US, Russia, UK, France, China, India, Pakistan and Israel \u2013 possessed approximately 4,400 operational nuclear weapons. Nearly 2,000 of these are kept in a state of high operational alert. If all nuclear warheads are counted, these states together possess a total of approximately 17,265 nuclear weapons, says the Sipri report. Signatories of the non-proliferation treaty, including the UK, pledge to work towards nuclear disarmament. &quot;Once again there was little to inspire hope that the nuclear-weapon-possessing states are genuinely willing to give up their nuclear arsenals. The long-term modernisation programmes under way in these states suggest that nuclear weapons are still a marker of international status and power,&quot; said the Sipri senior researcher Shannon Kile. Of the five &quot;official&quot; nuclear states, China appears to be expanding its nuclear arsenal while India and Pakistan are expanding both their nuclear weapon stockpiles and their missile delivery capabilities, Sipri says. Pakistan is also expanding its main plutonium-production complex at Khushab, Punjab. Sipri estimates that Israel has approximately 80 intact nuclear weapons, 50 for its Jericho II medium-range ballistic missiles and 30 for gravity bombs carried by aircraft. Israel may also have produced non-strategic nuclear weapons, including artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions, says the yearbook. It estimates world military expenditure in 2012 to have been $1.756tn (\u00a31.157tn), representing 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP) \u2013 or $249 for each person in the world. Though a little lower than the previous two years, the total is higher than in any year between the end of the second world war and 2010. The distribution of global spending in 2012 shows a shift from the west to other parts of the world, including the Middle East and north Africa, eastern Europe and the developing world. The international arms trade in major conventional weapons grew by 17% between 2003 and 2012.

So what parents and pupils make of it is anyone&apos;s guess. The latest idea is for I-levels to replace GCSEs in some courses starting from 2015. This comes a year after the education secretary, Michael Gove, first suggested a radical change to exams at 16, with GCSEs to be replaced by traditional, harder, O-level-style exams and, most controversially, a qualification for supposedly &quot;less intelligent&quot; pupils similar to the old CSE. Gove \u2013 who is attempting to reform the entire curriculum and qualifications framework for five- to 18-year-olds during a single five-year term \u2013 sees a GCSE overhaul as central to that, citing England&apos;s largely static performance in a major international testing study as evidence of the need for change. The CSE proposal was dropped last September, seemingly under pressure from the Liberal Democrats, but Gove pressed on with proposals for a new English baccalaureate certificate exam to replace GCSEs. Alongside it, the current system of several competing exam boards for each subject would be replaced in favour of a &quot;franchising&quot; model in which the boards would compete for a contract to run each subject&apos;s exams. Gove also wanted to remove the tiering system by which pupils took either harder or easier papers in most GCSE subjects, saying it &quot;capped ambition&quot; for lower-achievers. But in February, he retreated on both the name of the new qualification \u2013 saying that GCSEs would remain, but be &quot;reformed&quot; \u2013 and on the franchising idea, after both the exams regulator Ofqual and the Commons education select committee expressed reservations. He persisted with aiming to scrap tiering, but this was another idea vetoed, at least for maths and science, in the latest development: a paper reportedly to be put forward by Ofqual, with the regulator suggesting renaming the GCSE &quot;I-level&quot;, for &quot;intermediate&quot;. GCSEs might need renaming for two reasons: first, to act as a signal to the outside world that these new exams will be different \u2013 harder \u2013 than current GCSEs. And second, to distinguish them from the Welsh and Northern Irish versions of the GCSE, whose ministers are not keen to follow England&apos;s reform plans. Gove believes England&apos;s exams must be toughened up to make them more stretching, spurring pupils to compete with countries such as Singapore and Japan, which do better on international tests. The situation is complicated, however, by the way policy-making works. Although Gove is supposed to set the overall direction of travel for exam developments, Ofqual looks at the detail. It has been acting increasingly independently in the past six months. Gove, who criticised GCSEs last year during a furore over the marking of English exams in the subject, has been attacked for undermining confidence in the system for pupils going through it. It seems fair to assume many will be bemused to learn, during exams season, of yet another possible change. With legal changes meaning all pupils must be in some form of education or training to the age of 18 to be introduced by 2015, some \u2013 including the CBI leader John Cridland \u2013 are questioning why we continue to need conventional exams at 16 at all. Last month, Gove told the select committee that his policy-making style was to put out a suggestion, listen to arguments against it and then accept the &quot;strong parts&quot; of that criticism. He would present the many changes of course, then, as evidence of his having listened. But, for those potentially on the end of these reforms, it must present a very confusing picture. \u2022 Warwick Mansell is author of Education by Numbers: the Tyranny of Testing"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/05/vq-day-upskill-britain", "sentences": ["In the 21st century, we cannot compete on a low-skill, low-wage model with places like China and Singapore, where workers are paid a fraction of what they are in the UK."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-05T08:18:33Z", "title": "Happy VQ day.

In the 21st century, we cannot compete on a low-skill, low-wage model with places like China and Singapore, where workers are paid a fraction of what they are in the UK. We need to drive growth from the high end of the value chain. Today is VQ Day, a celebration of vocational qualifications. These are critical to building a new economy and ensuring our competitiveness. But too often young people don&apos;t progress, getting stuck in a revolving door of low-level qualifications. A new settlement is required that gives young people a gold standard to aim for, increases the skills of the workforce and supports employers to use and develop those skills. Labour began to tackle this challenge during our time in office. In 1994, 22% of the workforce had no qualifications. By 2005 this had fallen to 13%. Today feels very different. Almost one million young people in the UK are unemployed. Investment in skills has been slashed, subjects such as engineering undermined, work experience opportunities cut and independent careers advice ended. While David Cameron talks about a global skills race, he is pursuing a race to the bottom. By contrast, we have announced our plans to drive up the standard of vocational qualifications. This includes a new Tech Bacc at 18, with rigorous courses accredited by employers, high-quality work experience and all students doing English and maths to 18. Addressing our skills deficit, on both the supply and demand sides, is critical to rebalancing our economy. Labour would ensure that far more young people get the chance to do a high quality apprenticeship, by using government contracts to create more opportunities. We also need to improve the standards in our further education colleges, which aren&apos;t good enough. In 2012, Ofsted did not judge a single college to be outstanding for teaching and learning. Eighty per cent of young people who leave school without five good GCSEs, including in English and maths, do not reach that benchmark after two years in college. Currently further education teachers don&apos;t need to have a good (A*-C) GCSE in English and maths to teach in a college. That&apos;s why one of the first recommendations from Labour&apos;s Skills Taskforce is to ensure they do. How else can we expect them to teach these subjects? Second, industries are changing rapidly, but 30% of teachers and trainers never or hardly ever update their experience. We support the idea from EEF, the manufacturing organisation, that further education teachers should spend time each year within a business to gain first-hand experience of the workplace. I want to look at how we can create new centres of excellence for vocational learning \u2013 the equivalent of Oxbridge for technical education. These would be world-class colleges, aimed at attracting the brightest and best students, like the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich or the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. In February, I visited Switzerland. Nothing sums up their attitude more than the phrase they use for vocational education: zweiter k\u00f6nigsweg meaning &quot;a second king&apos;s path&quot; that runs alongside higher education. The vocational route is just as prestigious as the academic one and chosen by two-fifths of the highest achievers. Two-thirds of Swiss students are enrolled in vocational programmes from the age of 15, more than twice the level in the UK. This isn&apos;t just for construction or engineering firms; high-profile financial services firms such as UBS and Credit Suisse have impressive apprenticeship programmes that our own City institutions could learn from. It&apos;s no wonder that Switzerland has the lowest rate of young people out of work in the OECD \u2013 around 7%, compared with 20% in the UK. We could learn from Switzerland how to get more young people into employment and training. Part of the solution is getting more young people to see vocational education as an attractive and worthwhile option. To effectively rebalance our economy, we need a skills system which meets the needs of our economy and leaves no one behind."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/dematerialising-future-technology-consumers", "sentences": ["While the idea may initially sound crazy, the first vertical farms are already operational in Singapore, South Korea and Chicago."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-05T14:28:00Z", "title": "Dematerialising the future: what role can technology and consumers play?", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Behaviour"], "article": "According to the United Nations environment panel, by 2010 industrial civilisation was eating its way through 50bn tonnes of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass every year. If we do not change our collective ways, then by 2050 this figure is expected to rise to 140bn. You do not need to be a resource scientist to understand that we cannot go on taking from the Earth to this extent. As a matter of some urgency, we need to develop radical dematerialisation strategies. Dematerialisation means lessening our reliance on physical resources. Send an email rather than post a letter and you dematerialise your activity. Similarly, if you download music or video it, that will reduce your consumption of physical resources in comparison with the purchase of CDs or DVDs. Unfortunately, while a transition from atom-based to bit-based media will help, there is a limit to how far it can actually take us. In fact, far more significant than absolute digital dematerialisation will be relative dematerialisation measures that reduce the resources invested in product creation and delivery. Using materials efficientlyFor example, 3D printing may soon help to partially dematerialise manufacturing. 3D printers build up objects in layers and add material only where it is actually needed. This means that 3D printing can allow products to be made from fewer raw materials. Already in the aviation industry, 3D-printed metal parts have been created by EADS, while Rolls Royce is leading an EU project called Merlin that is working toward the use of 3D printing in the manufacture of civil aircraft engines. Many manufacturing processes start with a block of metal, which is then cut down by machines to produce a final component. As a result, a 1-tonne aircraft engine may be manufactured from about 6.5 tonnes of metal. The opportunities to dematerialise using 3D printing are therefore considerable, as material usage could be cut by more than 80%. Localising manufacturing3D printing may also reduce physical inventory, as well as the resources consumed in transportation. Today, many items that are manufactured never actually get sold, while in sales terms, one dollar in seven is spent moving things around the planet. The materials wastage this creates could be greatly reduced if products were transported digitally over the internet and only 3D printed when required, and as close as possible to their final customer. Localisation will prove critical in the decades ahead. The planetary cancer of globalisation is not sustainable, and is based on the dangerous economic myth of an endless supply of raw materials and (relatively) cheap energy. Within a decade or two at most, the transportation of basic goods will have to be significantly curtailed. This means that we will need to dematerialise many things, not least our food supply. One way to produce and deliver food in a less resource-intensive manner may involve the development of vertical farms. Here, crops are grown hydroponically in multi-storey buildings within cities, so reducing the need for produce to be transported over long distances. While the idea may initially sound crazy, the first vertical farms are already operational in Singapore, South Korea and Chicago. . While 3D printing, localisation and urban agriculture have a major role to play, sooner or later mass consumerism will also need to come to an end. Over the past 50 years, marketeers have somehow taken hold of consumers common sense and convinced them that the constant mass disposal of perfectly good things is a sustainable proposition. In reality, building things that spend most of their days in landfill is madness and little short of species suicide. In the past, most people&apos;s possessions were owned for long periods, and repaired rather than replaced when they first failed. Mass dematerialisation does not have to mean that we will all own less stuff, but it probably does imply that, like our grandparents and great-grandparents, we will once again need to invest in long-term possessions, with maintenance becoming a matter of pride. Fortunately, the rise of the Maker Movement suggests that a world in which we repair rather than replace is on the near horizon. In 2011, even Apple applied for a patent for portable electronic devices that would be easier to repair. Suggesting that we need to dematerialise and actually making it happen are, of course, two very different propositions. That said, many older people harbour practical experience of an age in which we consumed less and valued more. At the other end of the spectrum, today&apos;s youth already spend a considerable proportion of their lives sharing digitally online. As our need to save resources becomes more acute, both the young and the old may have useful knowledge to impart to those in the middle age bracket who probably need to dematerialise the most.

A little more than 17 years ago, on a postage stamp in Singapore, the Sri Lankan thunderbat Sanath Jayasuriya had plundered Pakistan for a half-century from 17 balls, a figure which has stood the test of time. But as Tim Southee ran up from the Pavilion end to deliver that final ball of the innings Buttler, with 45 to his name and on an adrenaline roll of ferocity and impishness, had faced 15 balls only. One more six added to the three he had already struck would do the trick. The ball was just back of a length, off-stumpish and Buttler, abandoning any semblance of style, flayed it with cross bat high in the air and back over the bowler&apos;s head. Had this been Edgbaston this coming Saturday, or Cardiff later in the week, with their short boundaries straight, it would have been six. This time it dropped tantalisingly a few yards short. Buttler&apos;s unbeaten 47, with half a dozen fours to go with his sixes, was still a remarkable effort, helping, with the aid of Eoin Morgan, to accelerate England in the final overs from a situation of relative mediocrity to one of match-winning strength that led to their eventual 34-run win. Morgan, tentative at first, made 49 from 40 balls, with three sixes and two fours, before he was brilliantly run out by Martin Guptill going for the quick single that would have given him his half-century. Together the pair had added 77, the last 76 coming in the final four overs of the innings raising the total to 287 for six. Earlier the innings had been underpinned by a timely and elegant 82 from Ian Bell, although infuriatingly he got himself out, the futility of which he recognised by falling to one knee and bowing his head as if about to be dubbed a knight. Having played so tidily and with considerable panache it was a real shame. New Zealand&apos;s response to the challenge instantly set England back. Guptill has required no second bidding this past six days but Luke Ronchi has been less successful as a pinch-hitting opening partner. Given width, though, Ronchi so leathered Steven Finn and Stuart Broad, both recovered from respective niggles and returned to the side, that when he was out mistiming Broad to mid-on, they had made 39 from six overs. By the time Guptill was finally dismissed, for 38, with the penultimate delivery of the first power-play, they had 79 against England&apos;s 31. In the Headingley Test, though, Guptill had twice fallen cheaply to Graeme Swann, once bowled classically through the gate, and here, in the off-spinner&apos;s absence (he was rested for the game along with Jimmy Anderson) it was James Tredwell who repeated the dose. Once more Guptill had threatened carnage, his runs coming from 36 balls, but he can console himself with 328 runs in the series and a run of 357 runs in four innings between dismissals in ODIs, leaving him only 49 runs short of exceeding the record of 405 held by Mohammad Yousuf of Pakistan made in 2002. As man of this series there was no other candidate. Following his dismissal, as the cloud finally lifted and evening sun flooded the ground, England began to seize control, with Root pinning Kane Williamson lbw (if that is still the technical term for getting hit in the box in front of middle stump), Colin Munro going first ball to Broad, Brendon McCullum, not quite the force in England that he was in his home country this year, caught behind off Tredwell and James Franklin caught in the gully. The game was not safe for England while Ross Taylor was there and the former captain made 71 before he was caught on the midwicket boundary while embarking on a last-ditch six-hitting charge at Tredwell. The assault by Buttler and Morgan baled England out of a quagmire of their own making. Ashley Giles may still be feeling his way in his role as ODI coach but England&apos;s fundamental lack of impetus during the power-plays has been an issue for longer than that and has never been addressed satisfactorily. Cook&apos;s early dismissal to clever bowling by Mitchell McClenaghan \u2013 set up with away swing then the sucker-punch lbw inducker \u2013 set them back and needlessly deprived them of their single review but six runs from as many overs is unacceptable, as is a total of 51 from 15 overs of power-plays in all. Against that New Zealand made 70 for two from their first 10 overs. Thus in terms of runs at least they had knocked the top from the run chase, almost negating England&apos;s late blitzkrieg in the process. Once they had got used to the pace of the pitch, however, and recognised that the overcast conditions did not automatically cause the ball to perform acrobatics, Bell, in particularly, found his timing and began to play pleasantly. Jonathan Trott, meanwhile, was showing more urgency than of late, responding maybe to the pre-match barb of McClenaghan, who suggested it was Kiwi policy to keep him at the crease. Perhaps McClenaghan got the desired result, however, goading Trott into attempting to prove a point by attempting something more extravagant than usual and falling lbw. Joe Root and Bell then added 80 for the third wicket easily enough until in quick succession the former was run out by a superb combination of Guptill, at mid-on, and the keeper Ronchi, while Bell, when a century was there for the taking, drilled a catch straight to mid-off."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jun/06/ann-widdecombe-david-cameron-listen-people", "sentences": ["The early chapters in her autobiography paint a nostalgic picture of a colonial upbringing \u2013 her father was in the Admiralty and part of her childhood was spent in Singapore \u2013 and an Enid Blytonish Catholic boarding school in Bath."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-06T06:00:00Z", "title": "Ann Widdecombe: 'I wish David Cameron would listen to people'", "tags": ["Ann Widdecombe", "Conservatives", "Politics"], "article": "The taxi driver knows exactly where to go, even though Ann Widdecombe lives 10 miles from Newton Abbot, the nearest railway station, at the top of a hill on the edge of Dartmoor. They ferry her back and forth a lot, and like her. &quot;No airs and graces,&quot; they say. &quot;Very down to earth.&quot; When I arrive, a few minutes late, having accepted the taxi driver&apos;s suggestion that we take the scenic route, she is waiting outside her large, functional house, which she has called Widdecombe&apos;s Rest. She walks a little creakily, and I wonder how she copes living in such a spot. Her hair is grey and windswept. The blond phase and the Strictly Come Dancing curls have gone. Truly, no airs and graces. She bought the house in 2008 and spent three years renovating it, so it was ready to move into when she retired as an MP in 2010 at the age of 62. She has had a large pond built at the front and a swimming pool installed at the back, more for her great-nephews&apos; benefit than her own. &quot;I used the Strictly money to pay for it,&quot; she says. The large, newly built conservatory is very Homes &amp; Gardens, but the furniture in the sitting room looks like it has followed her round every house she has ever owned. The ancient coffee table is so heavy we can hardly move it. On the top sit two DVDs \u2013 Dr Finlay&apos;s Casebook and The Virgin Queen, a 1955 film starring Bette Davis as Elizabeth I. I suspect 1920s Scotland and late 16th-century England might both appeal more to her than 21st-century Britain. Widdecombe&apos;s autobiography, Strictly Ann, is published this week, an account of her combative life in politics and curious afterlife in showbiz, hosting Have I Got News for You, acting as quizmaster on a short-lived Sky programme called Cleverdicks, twice starring with Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood in panto, even appearing on stage at the Royal Opera House playing the Duchesse de Krakentorp in Donizetti&apos;s La Fille du R\u00e9giment, to the horror of opera purists. The book is breezily written, as befits the author of four novels, and characteristically honest, though the halfhearted attacks on excessive bureaucracy and national fecklessness are rather wearing, as if her editor is constantly reminding her to conform to strident, rightwing type. I had been hoping she would be bossy with me, too, perhaps berating me for my lateness, since it&apos;s always easier to print the legend. But I&apos;m disappointed. She makes me a cup of tea and promises me some homemade Victoria sponge later \u2013 made not by her but by a neighbour who acts as a part-time housekeeper. Her love of animals, especially cats (her website lists every cat she has ever owned), and vigorous opposition to foxhunting belie her tough-as-nails image, and the Victoria sponge may be the icing on the revisionist cake. It&apos;s tempting to portray her life in her moorland eyrie as a lonely one, but she insists she enjoys living alone and that the odd mix of activities that now make up her life is satisfying. Her column in the Daily Express means she still has a political soapbox, and the TV and panto appearances have provided a release. Doing Strictly, she felt free for the first time in 40 years. &quot;I loved the fact there was no responsibility,&quot; she says. &quot;For years, everything I&apos;d done was going to affect people. With Strictly, apart from Anton [du Beke&apos;s] shins, it couldn&apos;t affect anything. If I fell down in a heap on the floor, nobody suffered. People said: &apos;Is this dignified?&apos; I said: &apos;No, why must it be? Get it into your heads, folks, I&apos;m not an MP.&apos; I know that; nobody else seems to.&quot; She has, she insists, left the Commons far behind. &quot;I got the point of exit right. If I&apos;d gone earlier I would have missed it, and if I&apos;d gone later I would have been jaded. When I left government [in 1997], I lost the habits of government very quickly, and I understood the difference between government and opposition, which a lot of my colleagues didn&apos;t for a while, and similarly when I ceased to be an MP, I lost the habits of an MP. I didn&apos;t think I&apos;m an MP in retirement; I thought I&apos;m not an MP. Gone. When I go back now, it&apos;s as if I was never there. I don&apos;t go in and think &apos;home&apos;.&quot; Given her 23 years as MP for Maidstone, her time as prisons minister and stints as shadow health secretary and shadow home secretary, she could have expected to be elevated to the House of Lords, but the call from David Cameron never came. &quot;I was very disappointed,&quot; she admits, &quot;but no one has a prescriptive right to go there. It&apos;s entirely within the gift of the prime minister. I don&apos;t think about it any more.&quot; Some have suggested her opposition to hunting was the reason she was ignored, but it may have been more personal than that. &quot;I don&apos;t meet his [Cameron&apos;s] modernisation agenda,&quot; she says. &quot;He probably put the flags out when I left parliament.&quot; In the book, she calls Cameron &quot;big-headed&quot; and &quot;pig-headed&quot;. &quot;I wish he would acknowledge the concerns there are, and listen to people,&quot; she tells me. &quot;All through gay marriage the story I got back was not that the prime minister disagreed with people, but that he wouldn&apos;t give them a hearing. You&apos;ve got to listen, or at least pretend to be listening.&quot; Etonian arrogance? &quot;That&apos;s the caricature,&quot; she says, &quot;but I&apos;m not worried about Eton. Douglas Hurd went to Eton, Harold Macmillan went to Eton. It&apos;s a question of understanding the role. He got it far too soon. He would have brought greater maturity and kindness to the job if he&apos;d been a bit older and a bit more blooded by the world.&quot; While welcoming Iain Duncan Smith&apos;s attack on welfare dependency and Michael Gove&apos;s education shakeup, Widdecombe is pleased to have escaped this parliament. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t have enjoyed coalition. I certainly would not have been at one with him [Cameron] over gay marriage, and I don&apos;t like this thing of image, image, image.&quot; She is not a fan of fast-tracking women and ethnic minority parliamentary candidates, and has some fun in the book at Louise Mensch&apos;s expense. &quot;A lot of the A-listers didn&apos;t realise what it was about,&quot; she says, contrasting favoured candidates being parachuted into the Commons with her own experience of standing in two unfavourable seats before landing a safe one. &quot;I understood what a committee room was; I&apos;d done the jumble sales; I knew how to relate to the volunteers.&quot; Ah, yes, the swivel-eyed loons allegedly castigated by one of Cameron&apos;s aides. &quot;What a thing to say,&quot; she exclaims in her slightly strangulated voice. &quot;Even if it was a joke, it was a stupid thing to say, because it reinforces the view that Downing Street doesn&apos;t care tuppence for the people who put them there.&quot; Widdecombe was always the darling of local Conservative associations and still speaks at meetings, but these days they want her more for her celebrity than her trenchant views on capital punishment and immigration. &quot;All they want to hear about now is Strictly,&quot; she says. &quot;When I start talking about the economy and universal benefits, they&apos;re not as interested as once they were.&quot; I quote Enoch Powell&apos;s old saw \u2013 that all political careers end in failure. The Tory defeat in 1997 and the party&apos;s long period in opposition meant she never served in the cabinet, and her planned leadership bid after William Hague&apos;s resignation in 2001 quickly collapsed. Was she satisfied with what she achieved? &quot;If you&apos;d said to me when I was 21, &apos;You&apos;re going to get into parliament, be a senior minister of state, shadow health secretary, shadow home secretary, a privy councillor, be endorsed by the Times as a candidate for Speaker, have four novels published, and then have great fun after you retire,&apos; I&apos;d have said, &apos;That sounds like a good life.&apos; I&apos;ve never understood this business of &apos;I could always have had something more.&apos; If what you had was good, then thanks be to God.&quot; God. He has never been far away in Widdecombe&apos;s life. He is certainly here at Widdecombe&apos;s Rest, where she is converting a small room into a chapel. Her parents were practising Anglicans; her late brother was a C of E vicar, as is her nephew. She converted to Catholicism in 1993 because she objected to the ordination of women, and in the book describes her meeting with Pope John Paul II in 1996 as the most memorable day of her life. Her faith colours everything: her views on gay marriage and abortion; her sense that life should be governed by duty; her belief that society has lost its moral bearings. She balks at my description of her as a social authoritarian. &quot;Let&apos;s take the issue of gay marriage,&quot; she says. &quot;I do not care tuppence what consenting adults do. It&apos;s not my business. The state does not belong in bedrooms. So I&apos;m not authoritarian. I don&apos;t say: &apos;You shouldn&apos;t do this, you must do that.&apos; What I do say is that the state must have a preferred model, and the model that has served us throughout the millennia is marriage \u2013 a man and a woman in a union that is generally open to procreation. Marriage isn&apos;t about two people; it is the basis for the family. That&apos;s why it&apos;s unique, and therefore I think society can say we&apos;re keeping marriage for a man and a woman.&quot; I ask her what she thinks when she looks at the society around her. &quot;I try not to look,&quot; she says. &quot;If you drive through any city centre on a Friday or a Saturday night, you will be treated to the sight of young women wearing virtually nothing, drunk as owls, falling off pavements and thinking this is a normal way to spend a happy evening, with all the moral danger that entails. I worry about the culture of excess; I worry about the culture of celebrity; I also worry about the breakdown of the family. I hate young women having four or five children by different fathers, Dad playing virtually no role in their life and going off and having four or five children by other women; the utter breakdown of neighbourliness and the extended family.&quot; She contrasts the anomie of society now with the world in which she grew up. The early chapters in her autobiography paint a nostalgic picture of a colonial upbringing \u2013 her father was in the Admiralty and part of her childhood was spent in Singapore \u2013 and an Enid Blytonish Catholic boarding school in Bath. When her mother became frail in her 90s, she went to live with Widdecombe. Family bonds are very powerful for her, and her long-lived parents were central to her life. There was a long-term boyfriend called Colin Maltby when she was a student at Oxford \u2013 in the book there is a photograph of them in a punt \u2013 but they broke up (&quot;my overwhelming sensation was one of relief&quot;, she says of the moment when Colin bailed out) and she never had another relationship. Whether she has ever had sex is one of the great unanswered questions in British politics. &quot;It&apos;s nobody else&apos;s business,&quot; she told Woman&apos;s Hour presenter Jenni Murray when the latter bravely raised the issue. I ask her whether her closeness to her family was one reason she never married. &quot;Not at all,&quot; she says. &quot;My family wanted me to marry and have children, and they always rejoiced in my brother&apos;s family. It just didn&apos;t happen. I never set my face against it. I never said: &apos;I&apos;ve got a political career, I can&apos;t get married.&apos; When I broke up with Colin, I rather assumed somebody else would come along. But it was never a sufficient priority to go out looking. If someone had barged his way into my life, I would probably have been quite receptive, but he never did and I never went looking. There might have been the odd man I looked at and thought, &apos;You&apos;re rather nice&apos;, but there were no other relationships.&quot; Just a lifelong love affair with the Tory party and, of course, with God."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/07/conviction-egyptian-asylum-seeker", "sentences": ["After boarding the plane in Jakarta, we were again arrested in Singapore and sent back to Indonesia on 3 June 2010."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-07T02:32:00Z", "title": "Doubts about convictions of Egyptian asylum seeker at heart of political storm", "tags": ["Australia news", "Tony Abbott", "Australian politics", "Egypt", "World news", "Australian immigration and asylum"], "article": "Serious doubts have arisen over claims that an asylum seeker at the centre of a political furore over immigration security was convicted of murder and the possession of explosives, Guardian Australia has learned. Sayed Abdellatif, an Egyptian asylum seeker who arrived in Australia in May 2012, has been labelled a &quot;convicted jihadist terrorist&quot; by the opposition leader, Tony Abbott, and in numerous media reports. Last Thursday Australian federal police deputy commissioner Peter Drennan told a Senate estimates committee that Abdellatif had been convicted of premeditated murder and possession of explosives. The allegations and the fact that Abdellatif had been placed under a severe &quot;red notice&quot; warning by Interpol since 2001, prompted Julia Gillard on Wednesday to call for an immediate review by the inspector general of intelligence and security of the way security services deal with &quot;high-risk&quot; asylum seekers. The furore over the case has plagued the prime minister over the past week in Canberra, with opposition politicians scathing about the fact that the immigration minister, Brendan O&apos;Connor, was not told that Abdellatif had been housed in low-security detention up until August, when he was transferred to Villawood, a higher security detention centre in Sydney. On Wednesday, Abbott said in question time: &quot;Given that a convicted jihadist terrorist was held at a family facility in the Adelaide hills for almost a year through what officials call a clerical error, will the prime minister now concede that Labor&apos;s policies have made Australia less safe than it was under the former government?&quot; He reiterated his criticism in parliament on Thursday. But court documents seen by Guardian Australia, which appear to detail the convictions used to issue Interpol&apos;s red notice, make no record of a murder case or of any possession of explosives. The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights (EOHR), an independent human rights body in Cairo, has verified the documents. Abdellatif&apos;s actual convictions, of being party to a criminal agreement and being a member of an illegal extremist group \u2013 under the rule of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt \u2013 were part of the &quot;returnees from Albania&quot; trial in Cairo in 1999, heavily criticised by Amnesty International at the time for using evidence allegedly obtained under torture. Speaking to Guardian Australia, Abdellatif&apos;s Cairo lawyer, Muntassir al-Zayyat, said that his client was not accused or convicted of murder or bomb charges at the 1999 trial. Asked if Abdellatif had ever been accused or convicted of these offences Zayyat, who was speaking from Kuwait, said: &quot;Not at all. The accusations were only joining a secret organisation and being party to a criminal agreement to topple the regime [of Mubarak, who was later overthrown in the 2011 Egyptian uprising]. There was no killing mentioned at all.&quot; Zayyat&apos;s office were unaware of any other charges against Abdellatif. A second lawyer, Majdi Salem, who also worked on the case, said that the 1999 charges against Abdellatif had been misreported. He told Guardian Australia: &quot;There were no bomb-making charges. This detail emerged because at the time of the case, the local media often took their information from the Egyptian security services, and the sources were intentionally orienting the details to suit their own interests.&quot; The developments follow comments from the foreign minister, Bob Carr, that the judicial system under Mubarak should be treated with &quot;suspicion&quot;. He added that he would be &quot;interested in further information that throws light on the nature of the prosecution&quot;. &quot;Certainly the judicial system that President Morsi&apos;s government has inherited from the Mubarak regime has got to be treated with a great deal of caution, even suspicion,&quot; he said. The court documents, translated independently for Guardian Australia, show that Abdellatif was charged in May 1999 for &quot;joining a group that was established against the rules of law [and] held leadership in it&quot;, and &quot;participating in a criminal agreement&quot;. Further documents appear to show that Abdellatif successfully overturned the charges of &quot;criminal agreement&quot; years later. Abdellatif is understood to be challenging his conviction for being a member of an extremist group, and Guardian Australia has also seen correspondence from Abdellatif to the EOHR, which details an application for amnesty made to the current Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, three months ago. Zayyat claimed that Abdellatif&apos;s 1999 trial, in which he was convicted in absentia while exiled in the UK, was a farce. Mubarak jailed thousands of Islamists in the 30 years of his presidency. &quot;This case was a set-up,&quot; Zayyat said. &quot;During the Mubarak era, the Egyptian authorities wanted to charge all of the exiled Islamist opposition so they can justify requests to have them handed back to Egypt. The charges are vague, like joining an organisation that was formed illegally, or criminal agreement to topple the regime. Therefore, Mubarak had the case transferred to a military court to guarantee verdicts against them. My client Mr Sayed Abdullatif is innocent.&quot; The &quot;returnees from Albania&quot; trial, which saw 107 people, including the current head of al-Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri (in absentia), stand accused of a variety of offences in Egypt in 1999, relied heavily on evidence supplied by Ahmed Ibrahim Sayed el-Naggar, who was allegedly rendered to Egypt after being arrested for involvement in a Tirana-based network of militants. This evidence is alleged to have been obtained through torture. Abdellatif was convicted as a member of &quot;Jihad Tanzim&quot; or Egyptian Islamic Jihad, an Egyptian terror group. On Friday Fairfax media revealed Abdellatif had worked as an accountant for the Kuwait-based Society of the Revival of Islamic Heritage, an organisation that was blacklisted in 2002 by the US for its links to al-Qaida. Ian Rintoul, an advocate working for Abdellatif in Sydney told Fairfax that Abdellatif had been working for the group years before it was deemed a threat. Abdellatif came to Australia by boat from Indonesia on 11 May 2012. He was accompanied by his wife and six children. In an interview with IRIN, a humanitarian news website funded by the United Nations, conducted in February 2012, as Abdellatif arrived in Australia, he is quoted as saying: &quot;Since leaving Egypt, I have taken my family from Albania to the UK and then onward to Iran. For years I languished in an Iraqi refugee camp there \u2013 pretending to be Palestinian lest I be found out and returned to Egypt. Later we travelled to Malaysia via India on fake passports and onward to Indonesia, again illegally. Throughout this journey, I faced repeated arrest and detention, as have members of my family. &quot;I arrived in Malaysia from Iran in 2010 before making my way to Indonesia in the hope of taking my family to the UK. After boarding the plane in Jakarta, we were again arrested in Singapore and sent back to Indonesia on 3 June 2010. I applied for refugee status on 30 August 2010, but almost two years on have no idea what is happening with my case. &quot;As a result, I have no choice but to make my way to Australia on my own.&quot; Guardian Australia also understands that the Australian Human Rights Commission had already intervened in Abdellatif&apos;s asylum case, concerned about allegations that the continued detention of him and his family in Australia was arbitrary, and therefore in breach of article nine of the international covenant on civil and political rights. Amnesty International Australia&apos;s refugee spokesperson, Graeme McGregor, said in a statement: &quot;We welcome the federal government&apos;s announcement of an independent review into the legitimacy of terror charges against a man identified as Sayed Abdellatif. &quot;However, it is vital that the review take into account the serious flaws in Mr Abdellatif&apos;s original trial by an Egyptian military court in 1999, on which the charges are apparently based. &quot;The trial violated some of the most fundamental requirements of international law, including the right to be tried before independent and competent judges. What&apos;s more, Amnesty representatives attended several of the mass trials of civilians before military courts, where they heard defence lawyers complain consistently that they were denied enough time to prepare their cases. &quot;It is vital that the case against Sayed be resolved as soon as possible so that the accusations can be addressed and so that he is not separated from his wife and children for any longer than necessary.&quot; Red notices are issued by Interpol following a request from a member country that is passed to the Interpol secretariat for assessment and approval. They are not binding arrest warrants but are the most severe warning Interpol can issue. Guardian Australia has contacted Interpol for clarity on the circumstances of the red notice served on Abdellatif and is awaiting a response. A public search of the Interpol wanted persons list showed no results for Abdellatif. Under Interpol&apos;s rules the country issuing the red notice is allowed to keep its listing private. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young told Guardian Australia she was &quot;dismayed at how this matter has been handled, with the Oppostion so desperate to whip fear and hysteria in the community. That approach has made it near impossible to have all the facts of the case calmly and reasonably considered.&quot; &quot;The Opposition are exploiting the government&apos;s failures in this case to continue their fear mongering campaign.&quot; A spokesperson from the Australian federal police said they stood by the evidence delivered at Senate estimates last Thursday. A spokesman for the minister of home affairs declined to comment. A spokesman for Tony Abbott&apos;s office said: &quot;I refer you to the statements from the Australian federal police.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jun/07/david-walliams-snapshot-in-time", "sentences": ["Matthew White lives in Singapore \u2026 Jesus, what is it about this school, everyone who doesn&apos;t end up in showbiz moves to the former colonies?"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-07T06:00:05Z", "title": "David Walliams \u2013 Snapshot in Time: TV review", "tags": ["David Walliams", "Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "&apos;Our photographs capture the stories of our lives, of who we were, and who we become,&quot; says Jack Davenport, doing the cheesier than cheese narration of David Walliams \u2013 Snapshot in Time (ITV). &quot;Most of us have a favourite photograph, a shot that captures a special memory. For David Walliams, this is that photograph.&quot; It is a good one \u2013 taken in 1983, of the Reigate grammar school production of All The King&apos;s Men. One figure stands out, a tall boy in a white dress, fanning himself \u2013 herself \u2013 queenily; he&apos;s playing the Queen. It is unmistakably David Walliams, then David Williams (who is the other acting David Williams, the reason this one had to change his name?) This was his first stage experience. It was such an incredible high, hearing the laughter and the applause; he thought, yeah, that&apos;s what he wanted to do, it was the moment it all began. Interestingly, he was second choice for the part. Who turned it down, I wonder, and if he hadn&apos;t, would David Williams have remained David Williams and be working in ... I don&apos;t know, IT? Anyway, David is now &quot;one of Britain&apos;s best-loved entertainers. He&apos;s a national icon, an award-winning comedy actor, a multi-million pound charity fundraiser \u2026&quot; Yes, all right, Jack, everyone knows who he is (and is he really a national icon?), turn down the bloody hagiograph, will you? Jack then turns private school apologist: &quot;For middle-class parents, giving their children a head start in life at an independent school like Reigate made the fees a price worth paying \u2026&quot; Not Jack&apos;s fault, I know, he&apos;s just reading it, but it&apos;s best just to ignore the voiceover. Anyway, David&apos;s going to try to track down the other people, the Queen&apos;s ladies-in-waiting, in the photo and restage it, 30 years on. Nice idea. First up then: Nicholas Trimbee, the angel-voiced soloist in 1983, and now \u2026 an IT worker, it turns out, in Seattle! David calls him. Would he come over to Reigate to restage the photo? No, says Nicholas, too busy. Oh \u2013 OK, well, that&apos;s a shame, says David. He could have at least tried to persuade him. Right, what about the others in the photo. Well, that&apos;s Douglas Proctor, David thinks. And the others he can&apos;t really remember the names of \u2026 And that&apos;s kind of the problem. It is a lovely idea, recreating this pivotal point in his life. But you&apos;d hope that it would be a big Friends Reunited moment, old memories and secrets flooding back, as well as a lot of looking around to see who has aged best, got the most hair, been most/least successful, all that. And lives \u2013 the highs and lows \u2013 compared, movingly, a Seven\u00a0Up element to it. There&apos;s very little of that though, and they weren&apos;t actually friends. Casual Acquaintances Reunited then. Plus, it&apos;s really just about David. And he&apos;s obviously done best, of course. The others in the photo, who David doesn&apos;t really remember, haven&apos;t done badly though. Douglas Proctor works for the University of Melbourne. Karl Hackett also lives in Australia and works for a mining corporation. Matthew White lives in Singapore \u2026 Jesus, what is it about this school, everyone who doesn&apos;t end up in showbiz moves to the former colonies? If you&apos;ve got a bit of money and you want to give your sons \u2013 and now daughters \u2013 a head start in life, and then don&apos;t want to see much of them at all, send them to Reigate grammar school. The former schoolboys and ladies-in-waiting fly in from their far-flung corners, except for Nicholas Trimbee, who&apos;s too busy with his IT in Seattle, remember; he sends a lifesize photo. They meet up in the old school hall. It&apos;s a bit awkward \u2013 they clearly don&apos;t recognise each other. And they&apos;re all jet-lagged of course, apart from David who&apos;s been driven from London in the back of a limo. Even he seems slightly underwhelmed by the whole thing. Mr\u00a0Shipton and Mr Marsh, the two teachers who put the play on back in 1983, are there too, which is nice. They&apos;re the most significant people here, the people who unlocked David and changed the course of his life, even if he wasn&apos;t their first choice for Queen. On go their dresses, similar to the ones they wore 30 years ago, and the mood lightens. Everything&apos;s always better after you put on a dress and a bit of lippy. The new photo is taken. It&apos;s a good one, again; it captures the story of David&apos;s life, of who he was, and who he&apos;s become \u2026 shush.

The trio of investment funds upped their bid by 75p to \u00a322 a share after Severn rejected a \u00a34.96bn approach on Monday. Its board convened a meeting to discuss the offer, which the suitors described as a &quot;full and fair&quot; bid for a firm that provides water and sewerage services to 4.2m homes and businesses in the Midlands and mid-Wales. One of the members of the LongRiver consortium urged the board to back the new offer. &quot;LongRiver&apos;s proposal of \u00a322 a share in cash represents certain and compelling value for Severn Trent shareholders,&quot; said Michael Rolland, chief executive of consortium member Borealis, a Canadian infrastructure fund. &quot;We look forward to engaging with the Severn Trent board to enable us to make our formal offer to Severn Trent shareholders. Without engagement there can be no offer from the consortium.&quot; LongRiver said its improved bid represented a premium of 21% to the price at which shares in Severn Trent were trading before news of takeover interest emerged last month. The other consortium members are Kuwait Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund, and Britain&apos;s University Superannuation Scheme (USS). The offer price has been made conditional on the consortium receiving greater access to Severn Trent books and winning the backing of its chairman, Andrew Duff, and his board. Headway must be made on reaching such an agreement before 5pm on Tuesday \u2013 the Takeover Panel&apos;s deadline for an offer. If no progress is made, LongRiver will be barred from returning with fresh terms for six months under the panel&apos;s &quot;put up or shut up&quot; rules. Duff said the previous LongRiver offer this week was dismissed as it did not take into account Severn&apos;s unique attributes. &quot;[It] fails to value the attractions to Severn Trent&apos;s shareholders of [our] increasingly rare combination of yield, inflation-linked business model and potential,&quot; he said. Severn is the latest British utility to attract takeover interest and is one of only three British water utilities that remain listed. The other seven are now in private hands. Kelda Group, the FTSE 100 waterworks firm formerly known as Yorkshire Water, was taken private in 2008 by a consortium including Citigroup Alternative Investments, HSBC, the Prudential and GIC, a Singapore sovereign fund. In 2006 Thames Water was acquired by a consortium led by Australian infrastructure specialists Macquarie Group. Northumbrian Water was acquired almost two years ago by Chinese infrastructure investor Cheung Kong, which has investments in China, Australia, Canada and the Philippines as well as the UK. A spokesman for Severn Trent could not be reached for comment on LongRiver&apos;s new proposal. The firm has previously stressed its achievements and prospects as justification for spurning previous proposals. Severn points to a 72% total shareholder return since April 2010. Since the business was privatised in 1990, it added, the group&apos;s regulatory capital value has expanded from \u00a3865m to \u00a37.36bn. Shares in Severn Trent last night closed up 50p, or 2.48%, at \u00a320.70 \u2013 some way short of LongRiver&apos;s new offer, even after accounting for the 45.41p proposed dividend which is included in the consortium&apos;s provisional price. But the shares had risen as high as \u00a322 during the day as investors banked on an even higher bid but then settled some way below the offer price, indicating that some shareholders believe a deal may be in the offing. One top 20 investor, speaking to Reuters, said: &quot;A bid at \u00a322 seems a very fair out-turn.&quot; The government has been trying to encourage pension schemes to invest in infrastructure projects in recent years and has looked at a number of ways of incentivising such deals. Water utilities are seen as an attractive investment because they are closely regulated, which helps give certainty on the steady returns that investors receive from such businesses. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS has been growing its so-called alternative investments, expanding into areas such as forest land, hedge funds, private equity and infrastructure projects. Severn Trent bidders need to offer more The bidders for Severn Trent can huff and puff all they like about the wonderful takeover price they are offering, but the hope here is that the board tells them to jump into the nearest reservoir. There are two reasons why. First, their third offer of \u00a35.3bn, or \u00a322 a share, is still not a knockout. OK, a 21% premium to the pre-approach price looks pretty if instant gratification is your taste. But who owns a water company for quick thrills? The game is about the steady accumulation of inflation-proof dividends. That&apos;s what Severn Trent offers if management does its job well and the regulatory regime is roughly stable. At \u00a323, the board is probably obliged to surrender. But \u00a322, or \u00a321.55 after the payment of the final dividend, should be rejected. Second, the LongRiver consortium \u2013 comprising a Canadian pension fund, the Kuwait Investment Office and the UK universities pension scheme \u2013 still hasn&apos;t said a word about how customers will be treated. It should have set out its thinking on day one.

As an officer in the Royal Army Medical Corps, arriving in Singapore five days after the Japanese surrender in 1945, he was faced with the task of restoring starving and emaciated prisoners of war to normality. Just as the doctors who entered the German concentration camps had found, little was known about how to overcome this problem \u2013 though it was clear that returning to a normal diet straightaway might be lethal. With a colleague, John developed a semi-liquid diet (condensed milk, beaten-up eggs, sugar, multivitamins and antimalarials) that achieved dramatic results. Depressed patients became cheerful and gained more than 2kg in a week (having lost 15-17kg in captivity). John&apos;s second major contribution was recognising the special health needs of children in a multicultural society, writing a series of articles about these in the British Medical Journal. The needs of children from established immigrant families, for example, might differ from those of newly arrived ones, while illnesses in African-Caribbean children might differ from those in Indian ones. John was educated at Haileybury, Hertfordshire; Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge; and University College hospital, London. Several doctors encouraged him to enter paediatrics, which he did at Great Ormond Street hospital after demobilisation in 1947. He did research with the distinguished Guido Fanconi in Zurich (documenting a new syndrome) before returning to Great Ormond Street and taking a consultant job at Glasgow, a senior lectureship at Great Ormond Street and a consultant post in Sheffield. A hatred of pomposity, spurred by his army experiences in Raj India, underlay John&apos;s awareness of the needs of the less advantaged. In 1981 he arrived in Libya to help in medical teaching since the Italian doctors who had maintained the traditional links between the two countries had fled after Colonel Muammar Gaddafi took over. During its war with Ethiopia, in 1983 he was smuggled into Eritrea, where he advised on developing a children&apos;s ward, which had to be built in a cave. John&apos;s priorities were his wife, Dorothy, whom he married in 1953, and their four children, Rosemary, Gabrielle, Patrick and Emma. His interests were wide: archaeology, wild flowers, butterflies, gardening, photography, literature, India, cats and railways. In retirement he took to local and medical history with a passion, with his wife researching a surprising epidemic of plague that occurred in Essex and Suffolk just before the first world war. He loved travelling and visited Antarctica when he was 90. On a trip to a Burmese hospital he had known during the war, he was delighted to find the same broken wheelchair in the casualty department that had been there 50 years earlier. He is survived by Dorothy, his children and four grandchildren."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/09/terrorism-do-deradicalisation-camps-work", "sentences": ["After the 9/11 attacks, Yemen and Singapore led the way.", "The Singapore scheme, well resourced and with serious political intent behind it, seemed to indicate the way forward, and a predictably well-financed Saudi scheme was set up in 2004 when the kingdom was hit by a wave of extremist violence involving both hardened veterans of the militant training camps in Afghanistan and locally recruited men.", "Equally, success in many places, such as Singapore, may be as much to do with 24/7 surveillance of the released militants as anything else, experts say."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-09T18:00:00Z", "title": "Fighting terrorism: Do 'deradicalisation' camps really work?", "tags": ["Pakistan", "Afghanistan", "World news", "Al-Qaida"], "article": "Shabhaz Ahmed has a story to tell. It is an old story, one told by many men at many different times. It is about going to war, training, fighting in a foreign land, watching friends die and finally returning home, disillusioned by defeat. In the case of Ahmed, however, home is a village in the eastern Pakistani province of Punjab, the foreign land is Afghanistan, the training was provided by the Taliban, the enemy was the US and their local auxiliaries, and the hardships involved a lengthy period of imprisonment in appalling conditions. Ahmed is one of several hundred Islamic militants living in the Punjab who have been enrolled in a new &quot;deradicalisation programme&quot; by local police. The scheme aims to ensure they do not return to extremism. The Pakistani army runs another centre, in the Swat valley near the country&apos;s western frontier, where former militants from insurgent groups spend weeks on a scheme that also tries to reverse what military and police officials call the process of &quot;brainwashing&quot;. Such programmes were once extremely popular. In the 10 years following the 9/11 attacks of 2001, similar schemes were set up in almost every country where extremism became a problem, from the Far East to Europe. Some were lavishly funded, others poorly resourced. Based on classic criminal rehabilitation programmes, most involve a mix of vocational training and counselling, with a religious component designed to challenge the &quot;single narrative&quot; of Islamic extremism. They have been lauded by policymakers, counterterrorist experts and pundits as a critical part of the campaign to defend state and societies against militancy. The problem, however, is that nobody knows if they actually work. The Punjab police programme, though perhaps among the least well-funded, is typical of many. Ahmed, now 31, was one of thousands of young Pakistanis who went to fight US troops in Afghanistan in the autumn of 2001 and found themselves trapped by the rapid collapse of the Taliban regime. He had no previous involvement with extremism, he says, but volunteered with a group of friends from Karachi shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Inducted into a Pakistani militant group, he found himself deployed in the north of Afghanistan when US bombers, guided by CIA teams, dumped huge amounts of explosives on Taliban frontlines. Interviewed in a police safe house in Lahore, he is vague about whether he actually fired a shot in anger. He does however remember how, shortly after being captured by US auxiliaries near the northern city of Kunduz, he saw friends packed into steel shipping containers. Only a quarter of them survived the trip to the makeshift prison where he was held for more than two years. More died there. Eventually, Ahmed was transferred to a prison near Kabul and then back to Pakistan, where he spent another 15 months incarcerated in appalling conditions. He was finally freed after his parents and a local cleric vouched for his good behaviour. Ahmed got married, had children and set up a small shop: &quot;It&apos;s not much, but I get by,&quot; he says.     Learning a trade ... former militants study electronics at the Swat valley centre. Photograph: Mian Kursheed/Reuters    For obvious reasons, most of the deradicalisation programmes work with currently or recently detained militants. These, according to Professor Hamed El-Said, an expert in deradicalisation at the Manchester Metropolitan University, are a useful source of information, but not necessarily central to any ongoing threat. On the whole, no attempt is made to deradicalise the most committed extremists, particularly those with links to al-Qaida or who were involved in serious plots, successful or otherwise. Why then, do Punjab police still consider men like Ahmed dangerous? The answer, police officials explain, lies in the nature of the extremism they are fighting. There have been hundreds of terrorist attacks in the province in recent years, including some of the most spectacular ever in Pakistan. Militants attacked the Sri Lankan cricket team on the way to a match in Lahore in 2009. Police facilities have been besieged. Though there have been fewer major strikes in or around the city recently, danger remains, with &quot;hundreds&quot; of militants poised to move. &quot;We are not sure why it is quiet. They seem to be waiting for something,&quot; said one senior Punjabi police officer in December. &quot;There are lots of plans being foiled here. And lots of intelligence reports of planned operations that are called off because the militants know we are aware of them. But the capacity remains.&quot; That capacity depends in part on people such as Ahmed, argues Mushtaq Sukhera, head of the Punjab counterterrorist police and the man behind the deradicalisation programme: &quot;He&apos;s an ex-militant. The organisations turn to people like him for help with reconnaissance, with storing equipment, for safe houses, for transport. Without that kind of help they can&apos;t operate. It&apos;s a pattern we see again and again: people provide help on the basis of old relationships. That&apos;s why he is potentially dangerous.&quot; In the Punjab almost all veterans \u2013 particularly those who fought in Afghanistan \u2013 are known to local security services. The scheme there began early last year with a batch of 300 former militants, most with similar profiles to Ahmed. It has since been rolled out across the province, from Lahore and surrounding districts where law and order is strongest, to the rougher regions in the south, where militant groups with strong links to the military-dominated security establishment are well entrenched. Sukhera&apos;s staff, based at the new headquarters of the Punjab&apos;s counterterrorist police, approached some 5,000 possible candidates, mainly aged 18 to 40 and unemployed, semi-employed or unskilled. Those who accepted received three months of paid tuition in a craft such as plumbing, carpentry or electrics, followed by an interest-free loan to set up a small business. The aim was to counter any financial offers the extremists might make in coming years.     Former al-Qaida members play volleyball at a camp in Riyadh. Photograph: AFP    The &quot;students&quot; also had lengthy sessions with religious scholars in the Deobandi tradition, the conservative strand of Islam followed by the Afghan Taliban and some Pakistani militants. The discussions covered misconceptions about Islam, attitudes to non-believers and less rigorous Muslims, the concept of &quot;holy war&quot; and attitudes to the Pakistani state: &quot;It is a comprehensive approach,&quot; says Sukhera. One of the first regimes to look at deradicalisation was the Egyptian government of Hosni Mubarak. After initial reluctance, Mubarak&apos;s intelligence services moved to exploit divisions between hardliners and relative moderates in the Gamaa Islamiya group, which had waged a decades-long campaign of violence to establish an Islamic state. The intelligence aim was &quot;collective deradicalisation&quot;, by which an entire group is prised away from militancy, and provided a model for later efforts. After the 9/11 attacks, Yemen and Singapore led the way. The Yemeni scheme took the form of ad hoc outreach through interlocutors including tribal chiefs and Islamic judges. Poorly resourced and poorly thought out, it was as much aimed at deflecting US pressure from the government of President Saleh as fighting militancy. &quot;There was no follow-up and al-Qaida were offering $300 a month as a salary. A lot of these guys had families to support, so they just went back,&apos;&quot; says El-Said. Indonesia, also under pressure from Washington but unwilling to take harsher measures, launched a programme around the same time. The Singapore scheme, well resourced and with serious political intent behind it, seemed to indicate the way forward, and a predictably well-financed Saudi scheme was set up in 2004 when the kingdom was hit by a wave of extremist violence involving both hardened veterans of the militant training camps in Afghanistan and locally recruited men. The scheme was then expanded to deal with young men who set out to fight in Iraq and returnees from the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison camp. Eager to show their will to fight violent extremism, Saudi authorities went to some lengths to publicise their deradicalisation efforts, hosting conferences attended by intelligence services from around the world and leaders such as Gordon Brown who controversially shook the hands of a pair of &quot;reformed militants&quot; while in Riyadh. American forces imported techniques from Saudi Arabia into Iraq when they started working with the vast population of detainees in 2007\u201308; tactics learned there were imported to US-run detention centres in Afghanistan. By the end of the last decade, as the numbers of incarcerated militants grew and as understanding deepened in Europe, the UK and the US of such populations&apos; vulnerability to extremism, further schemes were set up. A major EU-funded conference was held on deradicalisation in Denmark last year. Overall, there are now thousands of militants around the world in schemes with funding running into probably billions of pounds.     An attendee has counselling at the Swat valley deradicalisation centre. Photograph: Farooq Naeem/AFP/Getty Images    More recently, however, some people are starting to ask tough questions about quite how effective such schemes are, and whether they could be providing governments with an excuse to avoid actually dealing with the causes underlying the militancy. &quot;Around 2009 to 2010, this was very fashionable. It really looked like the answer. Now it is looking like a bit of a fad,&quot; says Professor Peter Neumann of the international centre for the study of radicalisation (ICSR) at King&apos;s College, London. He oversaw a team that in 2010 produced a comprehensive study of 15 prison-based &quot;deradicalisation&quot; schemes. Those running the schemes inevitably laud their achievements. Ministry of Interior officials in Riyadh say recidivism rates for their scheme are 10% to 20%, considerably lower than those for &quot;normal crimes&quot;. The Indonesians claim that, of around 200 militants deradicalised, only about 10% have gone back to extremist activities. The US sees the effort with Iraqi detainees as a success, though it is clear the Afghan scheme has been a major disappointment. Sukhera says none of those involved with his scheme in the Punjab have reoffended and hopes to get funding for more than 1,300 militants to participate in the programme. Recent research questions such claims, however. Both the King&apos;s College report and a comprehensive study by the Rand Corporation published in 2010 point out that recidivism rates are neither the best metrics to judge success nor particularly reliable. The Saudi scheme, despite its apparent overall efficacy, has seen several high-profile failures. (Two key members of al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula underwent the programme on release from Guant\u00e1namo, but then returned to militancy.) Of several hundred militants detained in Indonesia since the October 2002 Bali bombing, only 20 could be considered reformed and are actively working with police. At least 20 recidivists were involved in the terrorist network uncovered in Aceh in north-western Indonesia in March 2010, including some who had previously been arrested for ordinary crimes, such as drugs and, in one case, murder, the Rand report notes. Equally, success in many places, such as Singapore, may be as much to do with 24/7 surveillance of the released militants as anything else, experts say. In the Punjab, the former militants are all known to police and intelligence services and are often have to check in regularly with the authorities. Another worry is the nature of the supposed deradicalisation. In Saudi Arabia, clerics told veterans returning from fighting US troops in Iraq in the last decade that it was not their desire to fight the unbelievers that was the problem, but their departure for war without the consent of their sovereign. This crucial theological distinction was often lost on visiting western politicians. In Indonesia, the argument from local clerics was similar: &quot;local jihad&quot; was unjustifiable, whereas global jihad against &quot;the far enemy&quot;, ie the west, was legitimate, given certain conditions. &quot;The cultural context is very important,&quot; says Philip Mudd, who spent 25 years at the CIA working on South Asia and terrorism. &quot;The bunch of kids who want to fight in, say, Iraq have substantial sympathy.&quot; This is the key issue. Deradicalisation does not take place in a vacuum. One of the reasons for the disappointment of the ongoing US-led detainee deradicalisation programme in Afghanistan is that, when released, its subjects return directly to villages in areas where support for the Taliban insurgents is strong. &quot;Even if you are convinced by what you have heard during the programme, you have to be a very brave man to go back to your community and start saying that everyone else is wrong,&quot; says Neumann. Critically, Neumann&apos;s team found that deradicalisation could only work when an insurgency or an extremist movement was losing. He cites the programmes in Saudi Arabia, now almost entirely free of extremist violence, and Iraq \u2013 where Sunni militant detainees had effectively recognised they had been defeated in their multiple conflicts with the US occuppying forces and the Shia population \u2013 as examples. &quot;Deradicalisation, done well, can be extremely effective given certain conditions. But where there is an ongoing civil war, such as in Afghanistan, it is much more difficult, even impossible.&quot; In Pakistan, where there is massive ongoing civil conflict too there is an additional complication. Many of the ex-militants on the Punjab programme belong to groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba or sectarian outfits that have received support from the Pakistani security establishment for decades because paramilitary groups are seen as a weapon that will offset India&apos;s evident demographic and conventional military superiority. Surveys reveal that, though those who target the Pakistani state are increasingly reviled, groups suposedly dedicated to a more international agenda or who are involved in broader social activism have retained a positive image among many Pakistanis despite the increasing violence associated with extremism, and remain deeply embedded in some communities. &quot;We picked up a man from one village who gave us the name of literally hundreds of men in the district where he lived who were involved one way or another,&quot; one senior officer remembers. Sukhera, however, is a believer. Last year he spoke at length with Malik Ishaq, leader of the anti-Shia terrorist group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and one of the most violent extremists in Pakistan. The 53-year-old militant was in Kot Lakhpat prison in Lahore with 44 cases of terrorism and murder involving at least 70 deaths registered against him. &quot;We had many sessions with him and spoke to him about his narrative. We defeated his logic, his rationality. We told him that this country had been created in the name of Islam and if you keep fighting, the poor of this country are the ultimate sufferers,&quot; Sukhera says. &quot;Eventually he agreed.&quot; The winning argument, the policeman says, was that even in Saudi Arabia the Shia are living in peace. &quot;There is no fatwa against them from the Saudi clerics, so why are you killing them here, I said. We had long arguments. Ishaq is now on the right path.&quot; Ishaq may have been less convinced than he looked. Last July he was released; there was no evidence to hold him any longer, a court decided. The number of attacks on Shia rose dramatically and in February, five days after a bombing in Pakistan killed almost 100 Shias and amid national outrage, Ishaq was jailed again. And though Shabhaz Ahmed now says he is happily married and committed to making a success of his new electronics shop, he still turns his experiences in Afghanistan over in his mind. &quot;I had never seen poverty like I saw in Afghanistan and I suppose it&apos;s true that with the US there and everything, there are more jobs for the Afghans,&quot; he admits. &quot;And I never really thought that the US was against Muslims.&quot; But many things still trouble him. He thinks, sometimes, about the problems in his own country \u2013 though he insists any effort to overcome them has to be peaceful. He remembers the men who travelled with him and the container trucks full of corpses he saw in northern Afghanistan. He, like so many Pakistanis, subscribes to conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks. &quot;What then is the reason that the [US] came so far from home, all this way to fight? Even now I don&apos;t believe the attack on the World Trade Centre was the work of the mujahideen. It&apos;s not possible. So who did it? I don&apos;t know. I remember what I was told, how a good Muslim believes that if you kill one innocent person you kill the whole of humanity. I am sure that is right. But also that one should strive to do good and protect the weak from tyrants. I am sure that is right too. So in the end all I can say is, I don&apos;t know.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2013.

And if you want to try balut \u2013 incubated duck eggs complete with embryo \u2013 it&apos;s the streets where you&apos;ll get lucky. If &quot;lucky&quot; is the word \u2026 That&apos;s why Bourdain was invited to speak at last week&apos;s World Street Food Congress in Singapore. There&apos;s just one problem \u2013 Singapore doesn&apos;t have street food. Singapore took street food off its streets 20 years ago. Because of health and safety concerns, the traders (or hawkers) were moved to warehouses with electricity and running water. And now, if you want wee nam kee \u2013 poached chicken on top of rice glistening with chicken fat \u2013 you&apos;ll have to visit one of the country&apos;s 107 &quot;hawker centres&quot;. Odd, then, for Singapore to host a congress of world street food, and to invite a man who is all about life off the beaten track to make the keynote address. Bourdain took the opportunity to bemoan the state of fine dining in London, New York or Paris, where he said the food was unlikely to have a sense of place. &quot;But on the streets of Mexico,&quot; he said, &quot;you know where you are.&quot; He raved about pho on the streets of Vietnam, and how it tasted better on a low plastic stool amid the durian and diesel fumes. But he didn&apos;t rubbish the hawker centres. Even a food hedonist like Bourdain can see that they have a lot to recommend them. The 107 centres \u2013 with 10 more planned in the next five years \u2013 are similar to western food courts, lined with avenues of uniform little boxes serving food. In the middle are plastic tables and wipe-clean seating. Each stall is given a government cleanliness rating, which is displayed at eye level \u2013 the difference between an A and a B can be a month&apos;s salary. All of the food is good. Some of it is great. But something is missing \u2013 the individuality that we prize so highly in British street food. To see the lunchtime queues at Maxwell Road, a hawker centre in Singapore&apos;s central business district, you wonder if that really matters. Business types queue for their chilli crab or fish-head curry next to schoolchildren and taxi drivers \u2013 street food in Singapore seems democratic in a way that British traders can only dream of. It&apos;s not just for the cool kids. Is this the way forward for Britain? Should we copy the model that has being adopted in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong? The Nationwide Caterers Association \u2013 the trade association for street food catering in Britain \u2013 is ambivalent. &quot;Traders in this country find it so hard to get permission to trade anywhere, I&apos;m sure many would jump at the chance to trade from a subsidised food court,&quot; says Mark Laurie, the director of NCASS. &quot;But they would miss the opportunity to express themselves on the streets. Street food is about quality, affordable food, and choice \u2013 our traders just want the chance to offer that.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/10/cameron-uk-success-globalisation-g8", "sentences": ["Giving a foretaste, he said: &quot;We spent two years analysing what they teach in the world&apos;s best school systems, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Massachusetts in the US, so we can import the best of their curricula into our own."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T13:51:55Z", "title": "UK success not in blindly embracing globalisation nor in going it alone \u2013 PM", "tags": ["G8", "David Cameron", "Politics", "Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Business", "United Nations", "World news", "European Union", "Europe"], "article": "Britain will be on the path to national renewal, with a big global footprint, so long as it becomes more competitive at home, engages with the fastest growing countries in the world and projects its values abroad in the EU, the G8 and the UN, David Cameron has said. In a set-piece speech on Britain&apos;s role in the world before next week&apos;s G8 summit, Cameron on Monday tried to offer a vision in which the country rejects an unthinking embrace of globalisation, exemplified by New Labour, or the timid alternative of go-it-alone Little Englandism. He also tried to present his domestic reforms to welfare and education in the context of the global race for jobs and competitiveness, adding that Britain, so long as it did not lapse into denial, could still make the choices that would determine its own fate. He claimed: &quot;This is the generation that hasn&apos;t passed the buck. Where there has been a fork in the road between doing what is easy and doing what is right, we have chosen what is right.&quot; Cameron chose the dramatic setting of the London Gateway, near Tilbury, the largest private sector infrastructure investment in the UK, being overseen by the Dubai-based DP World. The speech itself was months in preparation and is seen as the most important statement of his vision for Britain outside the party conference season. He said the need for domestic reform was being driven by the pace of global competition. &quot;Those who defend the case for an ever bigger state and ever bigger spending, or those who say we don&apos;t need to radically reform welfare or education, they&apos;re fundamentally saying we can ignore these leaner, fitter countries who are breathing down our neck. &quot;And then there are those who say we should turn our backs on the world and on our wider obligations, that we should cut ourselves off from influential organisations in the belief that we can go it alone.&quot; He said both arguments were appealing but amounted to denial \u2013 &quot;denial of a world where our young people are competing for jobs with graduates from California to Tokyo, where a revolution thousands of miles away can affect the guy filling up his van at a service station. Denial that we are a premier trading nation whose prosperity depends upon the maintenance of global peace and security \u2013 in which we play such an important role.&quot; But he also rejected those who &quot;embrace globalisation so enthusiastically that they lose sight of the national interest \u2013 &apos;Open your borders. National sovereignty is obsolete. Multilateral relationships are the only ones that matter, bilateral ones are so 20th century&apos;.&quot; Cameron said both approaches represented a form of national timidity \u2013 too wary of engaging with the modern world or too afraid to stand up for national interests. He said his plan for national renewal had already identified &quot;our key areas of potential national weakness compared to the rest of the world. One, our debt-fuelled, unbalanced economy. Two, our bloated welfare system. Three, our underperforming education system.&quot; He said Britain had been &quot;a 20th-century economy wheezing and limping into the 21st century&quot;. The UK was already in the top 10 countries in the world to do business, he said, and he predicted that the reforms he had introduced, from corporation tax to infrastructure, would make Britain rise in the next three years to being &quot;in the top five places in the world to do business and as the number one country to do business in Europe&quot;. He also tried to make his plea for reform in the EU in the context of the global race for competitiveness. He pointed out: &quot;Europe today accounts for just over 7% of the world&apos;s population, produces around 25% of global GDP and has to finance 50% of global social spending. To the vast majority of the emerging economies, the idea of a welfare system that incentivised people not to take a job would be regarded as national stupidity.&quot; He also attacked the British education system, saying it had been &quot;increasingly comfortable with failure while grade inflation robbed our qualifications of rigour and respect&quot;. He said the education secretary, Michael Gove, would set out his plans for reform to the GCSE exams on Tuesday. Giving a foretaste, he said: &quot;We spent two years analysing what they teach in the world&apos;s best school systems, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Massachusetts in the US, so we can import the best of their curricula into our own. &quot;We&apos;re proposing more arithmetic and algebra in maths, more detail in science, more clarity on punctuation and spelling in English, more emphasis on modern methods of computing like coding.&quot; But he rejected an entirely insular approach. He said: &quot;When your prosperity is won in far-flung places, when your fortunes are disproportionately affected by what happens beyond your borders, then your national interest is not just about standing up for yourself \u2013 but standing up for what&apos;s right, and standing for something more.&quot; He said: &quot;Over the past three years, we have been steadily transforming the entire outward-facing effort of the United Kingdom into a coherent plan to make sure Britain succeeds in a more competitive world. A big part of that plan is connecting up with the fastest-growing parts of our planet, re-forging friendships where they were forgotten. &quot;This policy of engagement, of connecting with the fastest-growing parts of the world \u2013 it is paying off. Over the past three years our exported goods to Brazil have gone up by half; to India by more than half; to China, almost doubled; to Russia, up by 133%. This is how British foreign policy is making the world work for us.&quot; Cameron defended Britain&apos;s involvement in large international bodies, saying: &quot;When a country like ours is affected profoundly by those rules, I want us to have a say on them. That doesn&apos;t mean supinely going with the flow of multilateral opinion \u2013 the lowest common denominator approach to democracy, as we&apos;ve seen in the past.&quot; He also promised the same ambition \u2013 and practical results \u2013 for his G8 summit next week \u2013 &quot;not for us some turgid communiques with little purpose&quot;. He said his key ambitions were: \u2022 The free trade agreement between the US and EU \u2013 which could add as much as \u00a310bn to the UK economy. \u2022 Getting behind African efforts to tear down the bureaucracy and red tape that prevents people from trading freely with one another. \u2022 An international agreement on tax evasion \u2013 &quot;because we can&apos;t just clamp down on this in the UK, the cash would simply move elsewhere&quot;. \u2022 Transparency in mining, oil and gas so that people in developing countries can see how their mineral wealth is being used. He concluded: &quot;This is how our country thrives \u2013 when we lead, when we strive to be more than the sum of our parts, the small island with the big footprint in the world \u2013 and that&apos;s the way it must stay.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/07/jumper-boy-manila", "sentences": ["It enables them to see different situations and realise that there are ways to break that poverty cycle.&quot;  Of the founding five members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\u2014Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines\u2014the Philippines in particular has struggled to break the poverty cycle."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T14:19:52Z", "title": "Jumper boy", "tags": ["International Development Journalism competition"], "article": "Manila temperatures hover around 36C (96.8F) in May and schools are closed for the summer break, but 10-year-old John Dale Medalle rises at 7am for work. Small for his age and sinewy, John Dale has the bearing of a football prodigy, but here in Payatas he is a &apos;jumper boy.&apos; Payatas in Quezon City is home to the Philippines&apos; largest open dumpsite, and its surrounding slums house up to half a million people. According to the Payatas Poverty Alleviation Foundation nearly half of residents earn less than 4,000 Philippine pesos ($100) a month. Every day some 500 trucks slop fresh garbage onto the pile, and every day thousands of scavengers scale the mountain to sift through it. As a jumper boy, John Dale&apos;s job is to leap onto the back of trucks headed for the dumpsite, climb inside, and retrieve sellable refuse. He gives the plastic he collects to his grandmother, who washes it and then sells it at a local junk shop. Sometimes the trucks yield treasure. John Dale has found pencils and pens and once a toy from a popular cartoon. &quot;It is a watch that&apos;s sort of a weapon that shoots lasers,&quot; John Dale said through a translator.  But the work is dangerous and accidents are common. John Dale recently cut his foot on glass and he says he has fallen from the trucks seven times. &quot;One time while I was trying to get on, I got dragged by the truck while it was moving. I was only hanging on to a rubber rope,&quot; he said. Like scores of habited dumpsites across the world - Beirut&apos;s Karantina, Khartoum&apos;s Hillat Kusha, Calcutta&apos;s Dhapa - Payatas might have remained obscure. However, in 2000 a tragedy thrust it into the spotlight: two typhoons hit Payatas and torrential rains destabilized the dump, then around 40 meters high. When the pile finally collapsed, some 300 people were buried under the deluge.  Recent coverage has highlighted the Philippine government&apos;s ambitious program to improve safety at Payatas. The garbage pile was recanted from 70-degrees to 40-degrees and cut with terraced steps to prevent landslides, grass was planted to limit erosion, a system to redirect toxic leachate away from residences and a pioneering generator that used methane emissions from the decaying garbage to power street lamps were installed. Local authorities also enforced an ID system, which prohibited children under 14 from working on the dump. However, UNICEF estimates that 1.7 million Manila children live in slum areas such as Payatas and with few economic alternatives kids banned from the dumpsite soon found work skirting its periphery. Some washed plastic, others became jumper boys. In 2011 Roy Moore and Naomi Tomlinson set up the Fairplay for All Foundation to help children like John Dale. The foundation began with the establishment of Payatas FC, a football club for slum dwellers. Some 80 kids showed up for the first training session on the local basketball court. Most played barefoot. According to Moore, local children had become accustomed to foreigners occasionally visiting Payatas to hand out food; establishing a regular program was critical to building meaningful relationships. &quot;They stop seeing you as a typical foreigner and they start to trust you a lot more,&quot; said Moore. For families who cannot afford to send their kids to school, Fairplay For All provides educational sponsorships to offset some of the money the child would make working; for orphaned children, or in cases of abuse or neglect, the foundation works with sister charity ASCF, which has a children&apos;s home.  The Fairplay for All Foundation now runs a drop-in centre which provides basic nutrition, education, and a safe space to play. This year the charity is starting an urban farming project, a micro-finance program, and canvassing for an area to build its own futsal court, classrooms, and a larger urban farm for the future. Payatas FC players have enjoyed success on and off the pitch. In April, 12-year-old Angelica Sagum was selected to train with the U14 women&apos;s National Team and in May, John Dale became one of 35 Payatas children to benefit from an educational sponsorship. When the summer break finishes in June, he will continue to work as a jumper boy on weekends but attend classes during the week. &quot;[The sponsorship] is going to help in many ways. We used the first [payment] to buy flip-flops and food,&quot; said John Dale. One of the most significant opportunities afforded to Payatas FC players is the opportunity to see a world beyond the dumpsite. &quot;Often in situations of poverty people lose the ability to dream. Over time, being in the same place, they get used to the same routine; they get used to the same system,&quot; said Moore. &quot;Being able to go outside of Payatas enables the kids to see the different ways that people live in the Philippines. It enables them to see different situations and realise that there are ways to break that poverty cycle.&quot;  Of the founding five members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\u2014Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines\u2014the Philippines in particular has struggled to break the poverty cycle. In 2012, Philippine GDP grew by 6.6 percent according to the IMF, the strongest of the group, however growth per capita has lagged considerably. Malaysia and Thailand, with comparable GDP growth rates over the past decade but lower population growth rates, have been far more successful in alleviating poverty.  In slum areas like Payatas, which operates mostly as an informal economy, macroeconomic growth trickles down even less and for many children opportunities are limited. When John Dale finishes sixth grade he expects to resume full time work; his grandparents might not be around for long and his younger brothers need to attend school.  In the face of overwhelming poverty, Fairplay For All has helped instil a sense of hope and pride among Payatas&apos; children. In a promotional video shot by FIFA Futbol Mundial, 15-year-old Payatas FC midfielder Ronalyn Lagata says that opponents sometimes ridicule her team. &quot;We can prove to them that just because we are from Payatas it doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re not strong,&quot; Ronalyn says. &quot;We talk about it amongst ourselves, that we need to beat them, but of course sometimes we can&apos;t. They beat us. But I think it&apos;s okay, because our attitude is still good.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/10/insibility-cloak-animals", "sentences": ["Scientists led by Baile Zhang at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore created the cloaks from thin panels of glass that make objects invisible by bending light around them."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T16:24:03Z", "title": "Animal invisibility cloak makes cat and fish vanish", "tags": ["Science", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Research and development", "Technology", "Surveillance", "Materials science"], "article": "     Scientists have shown off their latest &quot;invisibility cloak&quot; by making a pet goldfish and a small cat vanish from plain sight. The device is crude and unlikely to pass muster with the pupils of Hogwarts, but researchers said it marked a significant step forward in the science of the unseen. In video footage of the device in action, a goldfish suddenly appears as it swims out of a cloak submerged in its tank. In another clip, the lower half of a cat disappears as it steps inside a cloak placed on a table. Scientists led by Baile Zhang at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore created the cloaks from thin panels of glass that make objects invisible by bending light around them. Though rudimentary - the devices only hide objects from certain angles, and in both cases the cloaks themselves were partially visible \u2013 they are better than earlier versions that worked only with polarised light, or with microwaves instead of the visible wavelengths that humans see in. In a report on the work, the scientists say operators could adjust the cloaks to make objects invisible from any line of sight. They add that the devices could have &quot;important security, entertainment, and surveillance applications.&quot; The first cloak the scientists tested was a clear hexagonal device that was placed in a tank of water containing a goldfish. The fish swam into the cloak, and appeared to need some encouragement to re-emerge. &quot;When swimming inside the cloak, the goldfish becomes invisible and does not block the scene of green plants behind the cloak,&quot; the scientists write. The hexagonal cloak could hide objects from six different directions. The second cloak was designed to hide objects from a person stood directly in front or behind. This time the researchers projected an outdoor scene of plants and flowers onto a screen and put the cloaking device in front. When an obliging cat wandered along and sat in the cloak, its lower body vanished. In one clip, a yellow butterfly that is flitting between flowers on the screen can still be seen through the body of the cat. The cloaks are based on technology first developed by Sir John Pendry at Imperial College London. In 2006, he described how transformation optics could allow scientists to steer light around objects, and so make them disappear from view. Early designs of cloaks used finely-structured sheets of materials that behave differently to glass, for example, by bending light the wrong way. Later, in 2011, Pendry teamed up with scientists at Birmingham University to show that invisibility cloaks could also be made from natural calcite crystals. In one demonstration, they showed how small objects, such as paperclips and pins, could be made invisible beneath a cloak built from two calcite prisms joined together to make a pyramid. The latest cloak from Dr Zhang uses normal glass to demonstrate how simple designs can still be effective. Pendry, who has seen the latest study, said the work was &quot;a genuine step forward&quot;, but added that there was more to cloaking devices than hiding domestic animals. &quot;Behind the fun is the serious idea that people want to control light,&quot; he said. Using the same technology, for example, scientists are developing miniature satellite communications devices, he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/truth-richard-branson-virgin-rail-profits", "sentences": ["That was the story of Virgin Rail (now 49% owned by Stagecoach); of Virgin Atlantic (where the same role is played by Singapore Airlines) and it certainly fits Virgin&apos;s takeover last year of Northern Rock, where Branson was really the frontman for the serious money from America and Abu Dhabi."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T19:00:00Z", "title": "The truth about Richard Branson's Virgin Rail profits | Aditya Chakrabortty", "tags": ["Richard Branson", "Virgin Trains", "Rail fares", "Economics", "Business", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "Transport", "UK news", "Transport policy", "Consumer affairs", "Money"], "article": "Just over 18 months ago on this page, I called Richard Branson a carpetbagger. Surveying his greatest business hits, from trains to planes to cable, my piece noted a common method: the Virgin boss liked to move into industries sheltered from too much competition, pull subsidies out of taxpayers and then cash out. That was the story of Virgin Rail (now 49% owned by Stagecoach); of Virgin Atlantic (where the same role is played by Singapore Airlines) and it certainly fits Virgin&apos;s takeover last year of Northern Rock, where Branson was really the frontman for the serious money from America and Abu Dhabi. Sir Richard was not best pleased. Faster than you could say &quot;stroppy tycoon on the phone&quot;, a response in his name appeared in the Guardian, accusing me of a &quot;vicious&quot; attack full of &quot;vitriol&quot;. But admirable hand-waving aside, he did not rebut my argument: that for all of his talk of enterprise and getting employees &quot;really motivated and steamed up&quot;, Branson has built his business empire with millions from you, me and other taxpayers. Well, last Friday a report was published that, I&apos;m sorry to say, proves me wrong. He&apos;s an even bigger subsidy junkie than I thought. Produced by academics at Manchester University&apos;s Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (Cresc), and published by the TUC, the study looks at how Britain&apos;s railways have fared over two decades of privatisation. It&apos;s a hefty publication \u2013 more than eight months in the making, running to 166 pages and with more detail on the rail network than any commuter will ever need. But it boils down to one key finding: the only way Branson and the vast majority of train barons make their profits is through handouts from the taxpayer. And while you may know about the direct payments taken by Virgin and others, the Cresc team has also analysed another, indirect transfer from the public purse to private hands. By now, it&apos;s worth \u00a330bn \u2013 yet it is barely acknowledged either by Network Rail or\u00a0Westminster. Let&apos;s deal with the open-air subsidies first. If you tot up all the direct subsidies Branson&apos;s west coast mainline service received between 1997 and 2012, and convert them to today&apos;s prices, you get a sum of \u00a32.79bn handed over by us \u2013 before a single ticket has been sold. And it is certainly before you factor in the service&apos;s upgrade (worth around \u00a39bn, and paid for by the public), and the fleet of Pendolino trains (again, largely subsidised by the government). By 2012, Virgin Trains enjoyed spanking new rolling stock, a more frequent service and a superfast line that whisked passengers from London to Manchester in just two hours. With all that going for it, plus a booming economy up till 2007 and rising fuel prices, the company couldn&apos;t help but pull in the customers. Most of the improvements were subbed by taxpayers, with Virgin paying the state an agreed amount in the last two years of the franchise. Yet Branson and his shareholders could declare a cumulative net profit of \u00a3538m and trouser \u00a3499m in total dividends. No wonder some canny infants like to play with train sets. These sums are what got Virgin interested in rail in the first place. In his biography of Branson, Tom Bower records a phrase used by the billionaire&apos;s lieutenants while weighing up the west coast deal: &quot;It&apos;s a licence to print money. Can&apos;t go wrong.&quot; But there is another undisclosed source of cash enjoyed by Virgin and the rest of the industry. Network Rail has been cutting the track access charges levied on the train companies. Under its predecessor Railtrack, the fees were worth around \u00a33bn a year; they&apos;re now nearly half that, at just over \u00a31.5bn a year. This is an indirect subsidy given by the public to the train operators, and Virgin is the third-biggest recipient. So important is the handout that, were it taken away, Cresc estimates the company would have made a loss of up to \u00a3257m last year alone. Just so there&apos;s no doubt on the numbers, the Cresc report was shown to the Association of Train Operating Companies weeks before it was published. The trade body had time to dismantle the maths; but while it evidently doesn&apos;t like the conclusions, it hasn&apos;t repudiated the figures. Years of indirect subsidies have left Network Rail \u00a330bn in the red. This is debt guaranteed by the public, although very few people know about it. What all this resembles is a looking-glass version of capitalism. The public are handing money to private businesses for them to take a clip and pay us back the rest. Just in case that wasn&apos;t ludicrous enough, remember that Virgin&apos;s parent company is listed in British Virgin Islands, a sunny tax haven that is a stop pretty far from Wigan. And as we&apos;ve seen repeatedly with the east coast line, the ones who don&apos;t make a profit can simply walk away, dumping their service back in public hands. Heads they win, tails you lose. Branson is not the sole offender here; he&apos;s simply the most flamboyant representative of a completely rotten system for siphoning money from the public into private hands. The entire industry, as Treasury adviser Shriti Vadera put it in 2001, is peopled by &quot;thinly capitalised \u2026 profiteers of the worst kind&quot;. And as a former investment banker, she&apos;d know what those looked like. But the Virgin boss also loves to shout about the virtues of private ownership of public good. At the moment, he&apos;s lobbying hard to take control of the east coast mainline. If successful, he&apos;ll doubtless try to replicate his previous sweet deal, state-subsidised Pendolinos and all. And just like now, it will be us paying for it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jun/11/gcse-pupils-compete-asia-gove", "sentences": ["DfE officials likened the new examination structure to the O-level format, which was replaced by GCSEs in the late 1980s but a version of which is still used in Singapore, and which had a heavier emphasis on essay-based exam questions.", "&quot;In maths and science, questions and content will be more demanding, so that state school students can compete with their contemporaries in Singapore and Shanghai, acquiring the skills that the rich pay handsomely to pass on to their children and that are the guarantee of future opportunity,&quot; Gove wrote."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-11T10:00:17Z", "title": "GCSEs will allow pupils to compete with contemporaries in Asia, says Gove", "tags": ["GCSEs", "Exams", "Education", "Michael Gove", "Education policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Michael Gove&apos;s shakeup of GCSEs will mix 19th-century traditionalism and a modern concern to match Britain&apos;s economic rivals, with an end to modular coursework, an emphasis on final exams and a new grading system.

The content of the proposals has been published by the DfE in a series of subject consultation papers, with input from experts and a call for public response, while Ofqual is to publish a separate consultation paper outlining major changes to the structure of GCSEs, many of which have already been made public. The 600,000 pupils a year who take GCSEs in England will from 2015 face what the DfE describes as more challenging course content, with the first of the revised exams being sat in 2017. The department highlights changes to mathematics that will involve a greater amount of advanced algebra and statistics. The DfE&apos;s consultation paper on the content of GCSE history says a minimum 40% of content will be British history, and include at least one study &quot;from the medieval (500-1500), early modern (1450-1750) or modern (1700-present day) periods&quot;, and a minimum of 25% will be on world history. DfE officials likened the new examination structure to the O-level format, which was replaced by GCSEs in the late 1980s but a version of which is still used in Singapore, and which had a heavier emphasis on essay-based exam questions. The revised English literature GCSE will require study of at least one Shakespeare play, a selection of Romantic poetry, a 19th-century novel, a selection of poetry since 1850, and British fiction and drama written since the first world war. &quot;GCSEs will again be exams at the end of two years instead of being broken up into low-quality modules. Coursework, corrupted by cheating, will be limited,&quot; a Whitehall source said. &quot;Exams will test higher-level skills, such as more essay writing, problem solving and mathematical modelling, that universities and businesses desperately need.&quot; One climbdown by the DfE at the urging of Ofqual has been the retention of so-called tiered papers in maths and science, after earlier reports that they would be abolished in all subjects. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and College Leaders, said the changes were &quot;harking back to a bygone era&quot; of O-levels. &quot;Creating one untiered examination for all students, from those with learning difficulties to potential Oxbridge candidates, is an immense challenge with no guarantee of success,&quot; he said. &quot;Simply making exams harder does not guarantee higher standards nor mean that students will be prepared for a job.&quot; The reforms will first be applied to the eight core subjects of English language and literature, maths, combined science, physics, chemistry, biology, geography and history. Other subjects will be added in subsequent years. The biggest change is the end of modular course structures and an end to the use of classroom assessment in pupils&apos; final grades. Of the first batch of subjects only science will retain a coursework element, but it is possible that other subjects such as foreign languages will retain some assessed component. In an opinion piece published in the Times, Gove said that under the new regime pupils would have to study complete Shakespeare plays as well as &quot;display a command of proper spelling, punctuation and grammar&quot; to aid their future employers. &quot;In maths and science, questions and content will be more demanding, so that state school students can compete with their contemporaries in Singapore and Shanghai, acquiring the skills that the rich pay handsomely to pass on to their children and that are the guarantee of future opportunity,&quot; Gove wrote.

No doubt it was a foul on the right side as the full-back broke free but instead of blowing for a free-kick, Abdul Bashir, resplendent in a purple shirt, let play go. A number of the visitors stopped, expecting play to follow suit, thus committing football&apos;s cardinal sin \u2013 not playing to the whistle \u2013 that let Robbie Kruse in. The wideman may or may not have said &apos;thank you very much&apos; under his breath as he advanced into acres of space but Mark Bresciano certainly should have. All the midfielder had to do from the edge of the six-yard box was sidefoot the ball home for the game&apos;s opening goal \u2013 cool and classy as you like, as was the whole passage of play from the home team. It was a decent move by the referee from Singapore too. 2) Jordan couldn&apos;t control Kruse You can see why Bayer Leverkusen thought the Kruse would be a valuable addition as they prepare for the Champions League next season. If his former club Fortuna Dusseldorf had waited a little longer, they may have received more than \u20ac1.5m.  Kruse worked hard in Saitama a week ago and was a valuable outlet for the Socceroos under pressure from a confident Japan. Against Jordan however, he was the go-to guy for much of Australia&apos;s attacking play down the right side, in contrast to the erratic Tommy Oar on the opposite flank. Kruse had plenty of possession and while he was wasteful on occasion, when he used it well, he used it very well indeed. There are assists and there are assists that deserve an asterisk. He put the first on a plate for Bresciano and the second on the pate of Cahill with an inswinging cross delivered on the move. If he had stopped there, he would still have been deserving of the man of the match award but then he got in on the act himself by scoring a third that really did lay Jordan low. His turn in the box was sublime.  Kruse asked questions that the Jordan defence had no answer for and also posed one that would perhaps stump the smiling Holger Osieck: why hasn&apos;t he been selected more often? 3) Australia have lulled Asia into a false sense of security Whether you call it football or soccer, it really was the beautiful game at times in Melbourne \u2013 the counter-attack for the all important second was textbook, with the ball going through half the Australia team on its way from deep inside the home half to Cahill&apos;s head. The Socceroos are supposed to plump for pumping long balls, opt for the hoof and hope and play the percentages. Not in this heady month of June, they&apos;re not. For the second game in the space of a week, the Socceroos were less direct than a Hugh Grant character asking out a female lead in a 90s romcom, and much easier to like. The passing was crisp, the movement intelligent and the finishing ruthless. Australia used the width of the pitch not to create the angle for a direct diagonal to the box from the halfway line but to play their way to the byline.  4) Lucas Neill can score These days when England lose to Germany, they can at least amuse themselves by chanting &quot;5-1, even Heskey scored,&quot; in reference to that famous 2002 World Cup qualifier in Munich. And perhaps for all eternity, Jordan fans will suffer a similar fate when they take on Australia. So dominant were the Socceroos that their captain, Lucas Neill, scored his first ever goal in the green and gold in his 91st appearance, 17 years after making his debut. The defender has had his knockers after turning down Liverpool for West Ham, playing in the Middle East and then playing for the Socceroos without a club, but there can be little doubt that he has been an excellent servant for his country. He was missed against Oman in March, mighty in Japan and even Jordan fans would not have begrudged his delighted celebration at the Etihad Stadium. Perhaps the only regret was that the Sydneysider couldn&apos;t have waited a week longer and broken his duck in his hometown. 5) Jordan paid the price for lack of ambition The visitors did little to show that their record of three defeats from three previous away games in the group was unwarranted. It was a disappointing performance from a team that really had nothing to lose by attacking against an opponent under considerable pressure as the Desert Fox Adnan Hamad drew his lines in the sand too deep. The Aussies were concerned that the swift-on-the-counter visitors would be able to get behind the plodding backline but it rarely happened and Mark Schwarzer barely had a save to make. It was unfortunate for Jordan that just when they started to get hold of the ball and cause problems for the Socceroos early in the second half, Cahill, helped by the inspired subbing on of Archie Thompson, intervened to make it 2-0. Iraq are an unpredictable team but it is safe to say that they will ask more questions of the Australia defence in Sydney next week."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/business-support-sustainable-finance-smallholders", "sentences": ["Last year, the Singapore-based firm invested $118.6m in short-term finance for producers."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-14T13:19:00Z", "title": "How can business support sustainable financing for smallholder farmers?", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business"], "article": "When it comes to access to finance, especially in the developing world, small producers are typically left staring into a void. Without significant collateral, mainstream banks are reluctant to lend. Informal lenders, meanwhile, typically charge crippling interest rates. That leaves them with the possibility of governmental assistance or charitable aid, both of which are limited. Ethical players such as Union Hand Roasted Coffee are trying to fill the financing gap with their own initiatives. The UK-based specialty coffee company has strong developmental goals, and believes that negotiating directly with small farmers is the best way to deliver on that mission. Short-term lending Working capital to cover running costs is an even bigger concern for smallholders than money for capital investments, Steven Macatonia, Union&apos;s co-founder, points out. Crops such as coffee can often arrive with the buyer months after harvest, which results in a payment lag and leads to cash flow problems. So, Union provides many of its established suppliers with pre-finance worth 30% to 60% of the final crop&apos;s value at 0% interest. &quot;It&apos;s the best terms they can possibly have,&quot; Macatonia explains, although he concedes the model has significant limitations. &quot;Basically, we&apos;re a tiny company and we have very limited cash available for those kind of schemes unfortunately.&quot; Bigger brands have more money to hand. And some are directing a small portion of that to smallholders. Coffee retailer Starbucks, for instance, has contributed to the Fairtrade Access Fund which launched in 2012. The fund, which was set up by Incofin Investment Management, provides long-term loans to farmers&apos; co-operatives to invest in capital improvements, among other expenditures. These improvements should increase yields as well as helping farmers to meet the Coffee and Farming Equity practices (C.A.F.E), Starbucks&apos; in-house sustainability standard that it developed with environment group Conservation International. Commodity trader Olam is active in this space too. Last year, the Singapore-based firm invested $118.6m in short-term finance for producers. (Starbucks, in comparison, has spent around $70m over 40 years). As with Union, Olam offers 0% interest. In addition, it issues longer-term loans to some larger, well-structured producer groups with which it has a trusted commercial relationship. Even a huge multinational agribusiness such as Olam, which posted net profits of $87.3m in the first three months of this year, lacks the financial resources necessary. Its pre-finance scheme extends to the 313,000 farmers involved in its flagship Livelihood Charter initiative. That&apos;s a laudable figure, for sure, but way short of the 3.5 million farmers worldwide who supply the company. &quot;If a farmer needs finance, we will do our best to assist them in the pre-finance\u2026 this is real short-term, small scale financing,&quot; clarifies Chris Brett, global head of corporate responsibility and sustainability at Olam. &quot;But I&apos;m sure you can appreciate that a company like Olam can&apos;t finance everything so we have to work out how we&apos;re going to help to sort financing out within the [agricultural] supply chain.&quot; Social finance So what&apos;s the answer? All eyes \u2013 Olam&apos;s included \u2013 are turning to the nascent boom in so-called &quot;social finance providers&quot;. Financial institutions such as Root Capital, MicroVest, Alterfin, responsibility, Grassroots Capital Management and Sarona are among those at the forefront of this movement, which is geared towards investment opportunities that promise social as well as economic returns. &quot;Social finance lenders don&apos;t have an infinite supply of money either, but many are actually quite well funded. Importantly, as well, they have an interest in increasing or diversifying their portfolios&quot;, says Michelle Buckles, director of sustainable finance at the Rainforest Alliance, a US conservation group and sustainability certifier. Social finance is certainly much better than no finance, but it isn&apos;t perfect. Not yet, at any rate. From a producer&apos;s point of view, such finance comes at a cost. Interest rates typically range between 6%-12% \u2013 not loanshark rates for sure, but not insignificant levels either. From the lender&apos;s perspective, the transaction costs are very high, especially given the relatively small loans in question. Likewise, the risks involved in social finance tend to be disproportionate too. The most fundamental problem facing both parties \u2013 smallholder and lender alike \u2013 is often just the basic fact of finding one another. Rainforest Alliance is experimenting with a new brokerage service to address some of social finance&apos;s early imperfections. It&apos;s starting with the last problem first. With certification programmes in 40 different crop types in over 100 countries, it boasts a ready network of producer groups. For lenders, that represents an &quot;attractive pipeline&quot;, notes Buckles. The fact that most of these producers have met Rainforest Alliance&apos;s farm management standards means they should in theory lower the risk of lending to them too. Rainforest Alliance isn&apos;t lending any money itself, Buckles clarifies: &quot;We are acting as an intermediary. Essentially, we&apos;re looking to link producers groups to providers of finance. We collect information on the producer groups; find out what their needs are, what they need the finance for, and so on.&quot; It falls to the social finance institutions to undertake full due diligence, but this way most of the preparatory work is already done. It remains early days. The conservation charity is piloting the approach in Central America at present, before looking to expand it into South America and East Africa in the near future. Plans are afoot to launch similar schemes in West Africa and Indonesia later in the year. &quot;This is a natural compliment to what Rainforest Alliance has been doing for the last 25 years. We&apos;ve done a lot of work in the areas of sustainability technical assistance and market access. Helping provide access to finance is in many ways the third leg to the development stool,&quot; says Buckles. The social finance sector as a whole remains fairly nascent too, admits Lo\u00efc De Canni\u00e8re, chief executive of Incofin Investment Management. &quot;We want to see this industry evolve to be able to attract financing from a wider range of players since we believe that lack of access to finance is a barrier that denies opportunity to smallholders,&quot; he notes. Ultimately, he&apos;d like to see local commercial banks step into the smallholder credit market too. That is beginning to happen in some countries. The agricultural sector comprises over 10% of all bank loans in Brazil, Mali and Burkina Faso, for instance. Often lying behind such success stories tends to be an aggressive incentive scheme by national governments. Where uptake by commercial banks is slow, Buckles sees social finance providers as a &quot;key stepping stone&quot; towards loosening their purse strings.

On Friday night ratings agency Moody&apos;s said it could downgrade the bank&apos;s intrinsic or standalone financial strength rating because of the &quot;heightened uncertainty regarding the future direction of the bank&quot;. &quot;It cannot be discounted that the CEO&apos;s departure could also trigger further departures of senior staff, which would add further uncertainty and be potentially disruptive for the business,&quot; Moody&apos;s said. But it affirmed the bank&apos;s crucial long-term ratings because it expects the UK government to step in if there are problems in the future. Hester is being forced out to clear the way for the privatisation of the 81%-taxpayer owned bank next year. The warning over the possible downgrade came as RBS was caught up in an action by authorities in Singapore. Its financial regulators found that 133 traders in 20 banks attempted to manipulate interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks. RBS is among the banks identified for the toughest punishment. In a new development in the Libor-rigging scandal, which first erupted a year ago when Barclays was fined \u00a3290m for rigging the interest-rate benchmark, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said the banks had taken action against the traders involved, who had left, been demoted or denied bonuses. Their attempts to manipulate interest rates would be mentioned in job references, MAS said. The traders were not found to have successfully manipulated interest rate benchmarks known as Sibor and Sor, or foreign exchange benchmarks, but were deemed to lack &quot;professional ethics&quot;. &quot;Although the number of traders involved represents a small proportion of the trading community in Singapore, MAS takes a serious view of the need to uphold high standards of integrity in the industry and expects banks to foster a culture of ethical conduct among all their employees,&quot; the central bank said. MAS forced banks to hold more capital on reserve in Singapore for a year, with RBS, Swiss bank UBS and Dutch bank ING required to hold more than the others \u2013 up to S$1.2bn (\u00a3610m). RBS and UBS have already been fined by authorities in the UK and US a total of \u00a3390m and \u00a3930m respectively for Libor rigging. All the banks were also censured for deficiencies in governance, risk management and surveillance systems, and required to appoint an external assessor to ensure they change their systems. Some of the cases had been referred for criminal investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department and the attorney-general&apos;s chambers, MAS said, but the information available did not appear to show criminality had taken place. About 100 of the traders had either resigned or been asked to quit while those who remained had been disciplined. Disciplinary measures included &quot;reassignment to other jobs, demotions, and forfeiture of bonuses&quot;, MAS said. &quot;The industry will put in place measures to facilitate reference checks, so that an institution would be made aware if a potential hire had been implicated in attempts to inappropriately influence benchmarks,&quot; it added. Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation are each required to hold an extra S$800m while another group of banks, including Barclays and Standard Chartered, must retain up to an extra S$600m. Germany&apos;s Commerzbank was on the list but not required to hold extra capital while another group, including Citibank and JP Morgan, was required to hold up to S$300m. The action in Singapore comes in a week when the integrity of the hundreds of benchmarks used in financial markets was again called in to question when the City launched an investigation into potential manipulative traders in the currency markets. The action by the Financial Conduct Authority, the new regulator for the City, became known after Bloomberg reported allegations that traders were putting in client orders ahead of a 60-second window when the benchmarks are set. The FCA is continuing its investigation into Libor, with four other financial firms facing fines or other action while the parliamentary commission on banking standards, set up in the wake of the Barclays fine, is poised to publish its recommendations for reforming the City. The parliamentary commission is expected to clamp down on City pay, with a 10-year deferral period for bonuses and measures to make bankers more accountable. The FCA is also investigating manipulation of gas prices, while the European commission has raided the offices of BP, Shell and other oil companies to investigate allegations that oil prices had been rigged for more than a decade."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/14/brief-history-package-holidays", "sentences": ["1841 Thomas Cook arranges his first &quot;tour&quot;, a bespoke train trip for temperance supporters between Leicester and Loughborough 1855 Cook accompanies two parties abroad, exploring Belgium, Germany and France 1863 Miss Jemima joins Cook&apos;s first tour to Switzerland 1872 Cook embarks on a 222-day tour to Egypt \u2013 via the USA, Japan, China, Singapore and India."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-14T20:00:00Z", "title": "A brief history of the package holiday", "tags": ["Group trips", "Travel", "Thomas Cook"], "article": "1841 Thomas Cook arranges his first &quot;tour&quot;, a bespoke train trip for temperance supporters between Leicester and Loughborough 1855 Cook accompanies two parties abroad, exploring Belgium, Germany and France 1863 Miss Jemima joins Cook&apos;s first tour to Switzerland 1872 Cook embarks on a 222-day tour to Egypt \u2013 via the USA, Japan, China, Singapore and India.

One such moment is at the luggage information desk at Dubai&apos;s colossal, soul-sucking airport where, after the third overnight flight, the inevitable has happened and our bags have finally gone astray. Atherton has just done a full cooking shift at 22 Ships, his inspired tapas bar in the heart of Hong Kong&apos;s old red light district, while simultaneously checking in with staff about the lunch service at his Michelin-starred London home, Pollen Street Social, and fielding emails about his new ventures in Sydney and Shanghai. He&apos;s due at a meeting with a developer working with the InterContinental hotel group in Dubai at 9am to sign off on a deal to open a new waterfront property worth several million dollars. He is in the jeans and T-shirt he has tried to sleep in on the plane, and unshowered. At 7am the glum manager of the luggage information desk, at which we are the sole customers, is showing little interest in our missing bags. After extensive walkie-talkie conversations and a languid, fruitless search for a pen with which to take our details, a long hour or so has passed before he relays the information that &quot;I think your bags are somewhere in the system&quot;. At which point you might imagine Gordon or Marco, testosterone pumping, jetlag jagging, would have taken some selfish relief in reducing the manager, his system and the entire luggage information operation at Dubai International to a lightly astringent jus. Atherton, who worked for Ramsay for 10 years, creating the highly successful Maze, and who has, as I have witnessed in various time zones, an obsessive interest in the efficiencies of service, remains courteous. &quot;I tell you what,&quot; he says, &quot;I wanted to have a look at the fish market this morning before the meeting, so we&apos;ll head out there, and perhaps if our bags turn up we can pay for them to be sent on to the hotel?&quot;     Jason Atherton at Deira Fish Market in Dubai. Photograph: Richard Saker    We head to the fish market, a dockside hangar in which an extraordinary variety of sea creatures have been dredged from the Gulf to be vigorously descaled, chopped and then examined by some of the desert city&apos;s army of chefs. Atherton is in his element, enthused by the idea that &quot;there are probably 30 species here I&apos;ve never cooked&quot; and therefore further excited by the prospect of his Dubai kitchen, which might be open by the autumn, if he makes his InterContinental meeting. We head to the hotel to find the bags have been delivered, testament to Atherton&apos;s patience and local knowledge (&quot;I worked here for Gordon for four years and I know if you start shouting the odds to locals you are screwed&quot;). The chef makes his meeting, signs his deal, does a walking tour of the first-floor shell of a skyscraper fronting the marina in which his restaurant will take shape, and is still smiling at lunchtime when he sits down at the waterside opposite the building site, and celebrates the contract with a carrot juice. &quot;The thing is,&quot; he says of our morning, &quot;if I start to get annoyed about a lost bag or whatever, I just make sure I immediately give myself a kick up the butt. You know, I&apos;ve had more difficult days than these\u2026&quot; Atherton&apos;s journey to this particular waterfront began at a seaside about as far from the glass-fronted fantasy of Dubai&apos;s marina as you can imagine. Born in Sheffield, he moved with his mother to Skegness after his parents separated when he was three. He lived with his mum and his sister in a caravan, &quot;quite cosy but frigging cold in the winter&quot;, and got his first taste of kitchens and hotels at a guesthouse, the Maryland, that his mother set up on Skegness&apos;s North Sea coast. &quot;Even in the holidays we always had to work,&quot; Atherton, now 41, recalls. &quot;I would get up early to help do the breakfasts, then go out and be a donkey boy, doing rides for kids on the beach all day, then come back, help with the evening meal. My stepdad Dave was a joiner. He would be out first thing on building sites, then come back and put a dickie bow and a white shirt on and work the bar until midnight. On a Friday, the treat for my sister and me was to watch the telly, plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car, with pop and crisps, for an hour before the battery ran down.&quot;     Jason Atherton's quote which is on the wall of his 22 Ships restaurant in Hong Kong. Photograph: Richard Saker    This work ethic has clearly never left Atherton. After &quot;24 years busting my nuts in other people&apos;s kitchens&quot;, he invested every last penny of his savings into Pollen Street Social in Mayfair only two years ago; with the help of partners he now has eight restaurants and counting across the world (two others opened earlier this year in London, Little Social, over the road from the original, and the Social Eating House, in Soho). All have quickly won praise and awards and, more to the point, customers. &quot;We have two kinds of restaurants, extremely successful ones and successful ones, but they all make money,&quot; he says and shows me the daily incoming texts of takings to prove it. Esquina, for example, has paid back its investment in just 10 months. Atherton, who is married to Ihra, a Filipina who worked with him in Dubai, and has two daughters, aged seven and two, is about to start filming a TV series for Sky, My Kitchen Rules, in which couples compete to create pop-up restaurants in their front rooms; he has three cookbooks in the works. It is, you might say, his moment; but having seen casualties of previous such moments up close, he is anxious, desperate, not to let it go to his head. One of the fascinations of Atherton&apos;s rise \u2013 White singled him out recently as one of only three or four &quot;proper&quot; British cooks \u2013 is that he is very much a second-generation figure; he has learned from the excesses of the celebrity fathers. He won&apos;t say a bad word about Ramsay but they don&apos;t see each other now \u2013 &quot;his choice not mine&quot;; the Scot was characteristically annoyed that his protege eventually left Maze, but still Atherton has learned, he says, from his old boss, &quot;both what to do and what not to do&quot;. Much of this is detail. In his autobiography, Ramsay reveals that when he started out he was in the habit of chucking any complaints from customers in the bin. The chef was always right. In the course of our travels, Atherton has any complaints made in any of his outposts immediately texted over to him. In Hong Kong he discovers that a lunch party in Singapore had to wait 20 minutes for dessert, while one of 100 diners in Soho at lunchtime thought his steak a little fatty. Atherton immediately responds with questions to sous chefs and maitre d&apos;s, and apologies to customers. He talks in passing, &quot;don&apos;t quote me&quot;, of memorably truculent guests over the years but prides himself on never losing his rag. &quot;I&apos;ve never chucked anyone out,&quot; he says, &quot;and I don&apos;t imagine I ever will. I have had people in Pollen Street say &apos;there is not a single thing on this menu I like&apos;. But I kill them with kindness. I go out and say, tell me what you want and I will happily cook it for you. I&apos;m not interested in &apos;chef knows best&apos; bullshit.&quot; When Atherton worked for Nico Ladenis in London in the early 90s they weren&apos;t allowed to put salt and pepper on the table. &quot;If people asked for pepper, Nico would likely ask them to leave. To me, if someone likes a lot of pepper, it&apos;s not a problem. He has paid for it, he can do what he likes.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to think that some of this spirit is a legacy from Skegness. He agrees that there was probably no tougher crowd to please. &quot;We had busloads every week from Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham, Nottingham,&quot; Atherton recalls. &quot;We would have Leicester week, in which the only question you ever heard was &apos;Ow much is it, duck?&apos; I&apos;d have to check with my mum but I think to start with it was about \u00a33.50 for the weekend, bed and board, so it wasn&apos;t bad value.&quot; Atherton brought a good deal of that can-do possibility down to London with him. At 16, he wrote to the top 20 chefs in the country, from Raymond Blanc down, and asked if they might find a space for him. He received a positive reply from one, Boyd Gilmour, who had left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to set up Boyd&apos;s in Covent Garden. Atherton came down with his knives and his whites, said he could start tomorrow and that was that. He lived in the youth hostel in Earl&apos;s Court for two years with about a tenner a week to spend and &quot;loved every second of it&quot;. He didn&apos;t travel abroad until he was 22, working a season at the three-star Auberge de L&apos;Ill in Alsace. Five years after that he became the first non-Spanish speaker to work with Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli having turned up with a backpack and refused to leave until he got a trial in the world&apos;s best kitchen. In between times he cooked with White in his heyday at Harvey&apos;s and then at the Hyde Park hotel. His time in Spain perhaps gives most clues to the kind of cooking Ahterton aspires to now \u2013 smart, witty plates, with intense flavours, made with sharing in mind. &quot;You stepped into that kitchen and it was like you were in a different world,&quot; he says of El Bulli. From White, the original el bully, he learned something about man management. &quot;You&apos;d try not to catch Marco&apos;s eye at midnight when he was off hunting with his mates, otherwise you would be up making bacon sandwiches for them when they got back at five in the morning and then straight on to prepping,&quot; he says. He put up with that, and even, he hesitates to suggest, the occasional physical confrontation, because &quot;Marco was the best chef working in Britain. He was so fast and so perfect, all out of this complete chaos.&quot;     Jason Atherton and staff outside his Pollen restaurant at Gardens by the Bay in downtown Singapore. Photograph: Richard Saker    As I witness a few times, watching him at work, at the futuristic Pollen in Singapore, which is housed in a glass-domed botanical gardens on the bay, or at Esquina, his tapas bar in that heart of that city, Atherton is hardly reticent when imposing his standards on his chefs. He is only here for a day or two, so each observation has to count. &quot;When I do give someone a hard time it&apos;s usually if they disrespect ingredients, or if the veg is not packed away properly in the morning. I know it sounds OCD but my organic carrots, I don&apos;t want them tossed in a scruffy container: they are laid down nicely all facing the right way and treated with respect. I get angry if stuff like that is not done, but not madman angry.&quot; A running theme of our travels is the fact that Atherton only ever gets asked two questions by journalists: &quot;How did you survive working with Gordon?&quot; and &quot;Aren&apos;t you in danger of spreading yourself too thin?&quot; In a sense one of the questions answers the other. Atherton eventually left Maze not because of Ramsay, &quot;but because I couldn&apos;t work with his father-in-law [Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay&apos;s then business partner]. I tried for years. But it was time to move on.&quot; Atherton has so far been luckier with his own business partners. His principal backer is Mrs Mavis Oei, owner of the Goodwood Park group of hotels and daughter of the late Khoo Teck Puat, once Singapore&apos;s richest man. Oei was seduced by Atherton&apos;s food \u2013 he cooked for her first at Maze and then at her homes in Bray and in the Far East. Having invited him over to discuss a business proposition in 2011, she refused to let him return to the UK until he had signed a deal by which she offered an initial \u00a33m as finance for a 25% stake in what became Pollen Street Social. The rest of the opportunities have flowed from there.     In a meeting with business partner Peng Loh.  Photograph: Richard Saker    In Singapore, Atherton has breakfast with Peng Loh, a former lawyer who has hotel and restaurant interests throughout the world, including London&apos;s Viajante and One Leicester Street. Their plans for the former Foster&apos;s brewery building in Sydney are laid out on the table. &quot;What do the Australians eat for breakfast?&quot; Peng wonders. &quot;Well, I do this great kind of mini-English breakfast on a proper pizza,&quot; Atherton suggests, which sounds about right. In Hong Kong he meets Yenn Wong, perhaps the most immaculately groomed woman I have ever encountered, with whom he is renovating PMQ, the former colonial police barracks in the middle of town, with a casual &quot;bread oven-type place&quot; downstairs and a &quot;farm-to-table eating&quot; restaurant upstairs. There is talk of tracking down &quot;the only properly organic farmer in China&quot; for the veg. Yenn takes a precise note. She helped to design 22 Ships and they have plans for a speakeasy across the street. All of which begs an answer to the second of the two questions Atherton is perennially asked: is he in danger of spreading himself too thin? Inevitably, I guess, but the trick is to find chefs who instinctively know what he wants, for each of his satellites, and to keep them happy. He has a scheme for Andy Walsh, a young Irish chef doing precise wonders at Esquina, which gives him a 10% profit share. His chefs in Hong Kong and London are on the same incentive once the restaurants have earned back their investment. &quot;I feel like the bloke who did Dolly the Sheep,&quot; he says at one point. &quot;We clone them and we put them in a box and we ship them out. It&apos;s like Madagascar 3, crates of chefs marked fragile.&quot;            Atherton will have to find a few more crates yet. Three other London properties are planned for this year or next. A collaboration with the ultimate concept man Ian Schrager in the now defunct Berners Hotel; a City Social satellite of his deconstructed Pollen Street concept in Tower 42; and perhaps something in the old Bow Street Magistrates building in Covent Garden. Only a few places are beyond the pale. He was recently approached to do something in Moscow. (&quot;I have no desire even to visit.&quot;) Likewise Tokyo: too many great restaurants already. Otherwise, the world still seems a newly shucked oyster. Looking at that world through the eyes of a chef like Atherton is a curious thing. Cities become not so much multi-faceted metropolises as the home to places you can buy food. &quot;When we are not working in restaurants we are eating in restaurants,&quot; Atherton says, and in my time with him this seems literally true. In Singapore he takes his chefs for spicy crab at the beach on their Sunday lunch off; in Hong Kong we visit the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world, the dim sum canteen Tim Ho Wan. In Dubai he checks out, and loves, La Petite Maison, and puts his head round the door of the outpost of Wheelers, to which Marco Pierre White has given his name, which is all but empty. And all the time he seems to be thinking, sniffing, tasting opportunities. In his efforts to coolly colonise the world, one site-sensitive neighbourhood tapas bar at a time \u2013 &quot;we are not into concepts, we are not fucking TGI Friday&apos;s&quot; \u2013 it seems he is not alone. One night, on our way between Esquina in Singapore and his bar over the road (which requires a password to enter, and in which a Buddhist cocktail impresario serves drinks in miniature wooden dhows), Atherton meets Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, another graduate of El Bulli. Andr\u00e9s is puffing on a big cigar, and also covertly looking for new opportunities. Outside 22 Ships in Hong Kong, Atherton runs into Alvin Leung, the so-called Demon Chef, who has just exported his &quot;extreme fusion&quot; cooking to London. They talk of cities not yet on the international restaurant radar, Rangoon, Bangkok, Manila. There is, Atherton suggests later as we wait for a plane, hardly a departure lounge in which he does not meet one Michelin star or another, all scenting possibilities in the global foodie air. A few days after we return, I look in on Atherton in Pollen Street Social. After the spin of the previous week he seems relieved to be grounded. Before an impeccable lunch he shows me around with pride and joy. The kitchen in which all the carrots, and everything else, are facing the right way, the dessert bar, and the Buccleuch beef ageing behind glass. Downstairs is his office, in a corner of the prepping kitchen, no bigger than a Skegness caravan bedroom. He doesn&apos;t have a PA, so he runs his mini-empire from here by email. What you&apos;ve got to remember, he says, not for the first time, is that, &quot;we are just a bunch of guys cooking food and having fun&quot;; and the thing is, he still just about believes it.

Less than two weeks after the explosive revelations by former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden on the creation of a privatised, American surveillance apparatus, a TIME poll finds a majority of Americans support the leak, and\u00a0Snowden receives a higher approval rating than US citizens view Congress.\u00a0History has also been kind to one of the great leakers in history, the Pentagon Paper\u2019s Daniel Ellsberg (who backs Snowden, too).\u00a0Never under-estimate the public\u2019s desire to discover what the state\u00a0is doing in its name. In Australia, however, the story has barely caused a ripple. Attorney general Mark Dreyfus refuses to acknowledge that Canberra receives information from the Prism system, instead saying that Australians should rest easy and feel protected by the warm glow of intelligence sharing with Washington. In reality, evidence has emerged that the Labor government is building a massive data storage facility to manage massive amounts of information from the US. Unsurprisingly, the US claims its monitoring is proportionate and legal,\u00a0despite some members of Congress having no idea of the scope of the secret programs. This is spying by any other name \u2013 and Snowden makes clear that everybody is doing it, despite protestations from Australia\u00a0and America\u00a0that only China is unleashing constant cyber attacks (Foreign Policy recently revealed that the NSA hacks into Chinese systems). Dreyfus tried to appease whatever public anger exists \u2013 and thus far it\u2019s been muted \u2013 by calling an inquiry into protection of information in the digital age. The Federal Greens rightly want far greater transparency on government surveillance, knowing that both Labor and the likely incoming Liberal government have spent decades colluding on ever-expanding powers of security services to monitor and track citizens with little accountability. Don\u2019t expect support from the privacy commissioner, either, who shrugged his shoulders and implied in a statement that national security should trump privacy. Nothing to see here, move along now. It\u2019s shocking that so few Australians even know about the existence of the intimate intelligence sharing known as \u201cfive eyes\u201d between Britain, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trust the system, we\u2019re told by The Australian\u2019s editorial last week; it isn&apos;t just \u201cextreme libertarians\u201d\u00a0who question the prevalence of the surveillance state. Australia&apos;s role as a US ally should never be to blindly accept dictates from Washington though if history is any guide Canberra sits too comfortably under America\u2019s hypnotic war machine. If this current assault on our communications isn\u2019t bad enough, the growth of internet censorship and the private companies that back it is a growing issue across the world, including Australia and Asia-Pacific. Although Labor\u2019s plans for web filtering were squashed, it\u2019s inevitable that such calls will grow in the coming years, as is already happening across the globe. Besides, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia\u00a0and Singapore\u00a0are just some of our neighbours that proudly restrict access for their citizens. Democracies are increasingly being pushed into a pincer move of censorship and surveillance that would be impossible without the co-operation of private firms making billions in profits. The US hires corporations to monitor social media; Israeli-linked companies have been essential in assisting the NSA spying program as well as, in one case,\u00a0selling Big Brother monitors to Egypt\u2019s Mubarak and Libya\u2019s Qaddafi. Snowden\u2019s NSA revelations only touched the surface of the deep collaboration between government and outsourcers. US journalist Tim Shorrock estimates that about 70% of America\u2019s intelligence budget is spent on private industry since 9/11. The extent of the NSA\u2019s cyber army is enough, according to a feature in Wired, to \u201claunch devastating cyber attacks\u201d. Whistle-blowers are an essential part of any democracy, despite the bleating of officials in Canberra, London and Washington. Governments are only outraged when embarassing leaks are finally unveiled; they continually give details to the press that makes them look strong.\u00a0 The largely supine response of the Australian parliament to the Prism revelations \u2013 with opposition spokesman Malcolm Turnbull being a notable exception\u00a0\u2013\u00a0proves how far this country is from proudly displaying an independent streak. Global surveillance, along with internet censorship, is a threat to both our personal freedom and ability to communicate openly. The post 9/11 world has taught us that states exaggerate threats to scare citizens into acquiescence. Multinationals have picked a side and it\u2019s the bottom line. Shining a light on the NSA and its global couriers is a public service that is only opposed by those with a vested interest in keeping the public in the dark."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/20/prime-central-london-property-bubble", "sentences": ["Photograph: ITV/Rex Features    In 2012, of 7,000 new-build homes sold in PCL, more than 5,000 went to overseas buyers, and the estate agency Knight Frank says buyers from just two countries, China and Singapore, bought 40% of them."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-20T06:00:02Z", "title": "Prime central London property prices inflate bubble fears", "tags": ["House prices", "Property", "Money", "Housing market", "Real estate", "Business", "London", "UK news"], "article": "The average asking price of a property in London has increased by more than \u00a330,000 since the start of 2013, according to figures from property website Rightmove, and is now comfortably through the half-a-million pound mark, at \u00a3515,243. It sounds a lot, but in some parts of the capital it is small change. Land Registry figures show the most expensive areas of the country - and those that have seen some of the biggest increases in prices - are the neighbourhoods that estate agents like to call &quot;prime central London&quot;. The property boom in these places \u2013 primarily Mayfair, Knightsbridge, the West End, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, and Holland Park \u2013 has been extraordinary. The average price of a PCL home is now \u00a31.53m, with the dearest deal done so far in 2013 believed to have been for a flat at One Hyde Park, sold for \u00a329.35m. It may seem that the only way is up, but politicians, retailers and even estate agents are warning that expensive homes are creating soaring rents, an exodus of small shops and a ghost town atmosphere, and that the market could turn out to be a bubble. Silent streets One big concern about the PCL boom is that it is leading to streets where nobody actually lives. &quot;More and more stats and anecdotes indicate that &apos;Fortress Central London&apos; is emptying of residents,&quot; says Ed Mead of Douglas &amp; Gordon, an estate agency with 11 branches across the capital. He says many overseas buyers own multiple homes around the world and rarely spend time in any one, however much it cost. As a result, parts of PCL fail the neighbourhood test of having milk and newspapers on sale within a short walk of where people live. &quot;Why should owners care? They&apos;re never here to need them,&quot; Mead says.     Chef Aldo Zilli moved his restaurants out of Soho in 2012. Photograph: ITV/Rex Features    In 2012, of 7,000 new-build homes sold in PCL, more than 5,000 went to overseas buyers, and the estate agency Knight Frank says buyers from just two countries, China and Singapore, bought 40% of them. Savills, another agency, says fewer than half of PCL buyers treat their purchase as their main home, the rest are just investments. &quot;Some of the richest people in the world are buying property as an investment. They live here for a fortnight in the summer but the rest of the year they are contributing nothing to the local economy,&quot; says Paul Dimoldenberg, leader of Westminster council Labour group. One of the reasons so many homes lie empty is that house prices have been rising rapidly, meaning capital appreciation is so high there is little incentive for some investors to let their property. &quot;Take a flat worth about \u00a3850,000 a year ago. That&apos;s worth \u00a3950,000 now,&quot; Mead says. &quot;The capital growth alone is equivalent to almost \u00a32,000 a week and there&apos;s no wear and tear.&quot; He believes some investors purchase new-build apartments only to &quot;bubble wrap and sell in pristine condition at some point in the future&quot;. This may account for why Knight Frank, which had expected no growth in PCL rents in 2013 on the back of City of London job losses, has now reported spring increases in rents in St John&apos;s Wood, Kensington, Marylebone, Belgravia and Knightsbridge. Not only have residential prices and rents rocketed, excluding many London buyers and tenants, but commercial rents have soared as chains have outbid long-standing local shops in a bid to attract wealthier homeowners. Aldo Zilli shut his two Soho restaurants in 2012 claiming &quot;Soho&apos;s not the same as 35 years ago when I moved in&quot;, and that the influx of chains that could pay high rents meant the area was &quot;becoming like Dubai&quot;. Roe &amp; Moore&apos;s art shop next to the British Museum has closed, citing soaring rents as a main problem. Meanwhile, the Heygate, a former council estate in Southwark \u2013 an area on the edge of PCL but identified as a growth area by estate agents \u2013 is being demolished, but only 79 of the 2,535 projected homes on the site will be offered to renters as social housing. Closed market Another issue raised by commentators is the shortage of homes for sale in PCL. Many existing overseas owners are not reselling on the open market; instead they sell or pass them on to members of their families, or advertise them through agents in their own countries. &quot;As a result there is less stock available and prices rise still further, narrowing the type of buyer who can afford to purchase,&quot; says David Adams of John Taylor, a high-end estate agency. &quot;British buyers traditionally used to trade up, even in central London. They would buy a flat, do it up, move to a terrace, then move out of the centre when a family came. That buyer doesn&apos;t exist in central London anymore, so turnover is much reduced.&quot; Hamptons International, another high-end agency, says there is now &quot;an acute shortage&quot; of stock. The firm&apos;s head of sales, Marc Goldberg, says PCL stock is &quot;45% lower compared with the bottom of the market in 2008 and 17% below 2012.&quot; Even if they are sold, many PCL homes are put on a private grey market where &quot;property is traded out of sight of the internet and done by email and telephone instruction,&quot; according to Henry Pryor, a buying agent locating homes for wealthy clients. When central London apartments and houses wanted by these buyers become available, details are sent electronically to agents who then inform their exclusive clients. Typically there will be no hard-copy brochures in order to ensure confidentiality for the seller and deter would-be buyers who are not cash-rich and able to buy without a mortgage. Currency concerns A big problem for PCL is its vulnerability to currency exchange rates, international financial crises and fiscal volatility. Knight Frank says buyers using US dollars will find PCL properties 7% cheaper than in 2008 thanks to sterling&apos;s slide, while buyers using pounds pay 17% more. By contrast, a collapse of the dollar or of Asian currencies which have shown similar strength against sterling could badly damage demand for London homes. On top of this, Adams warns that trigger events \u2013 a second international banking collapse or the introduction of higher UK property tax \u2013 &quot;could expose PCL as being nothing more than a bubble.&quot; &quot;It is easy to see a failed bank or a heavy duty mansion tax completely changing the perception among international buyers,&quot; Adams says. &quot;You could see 20% wiped off prices overnight. It would be the end of PCL as we know it.&quot; Although that prospect may not bring tears to most people&apos;s eyes, it is worth remembering that just as booming prices have had a knock-on effect on other areas, so would a crash. The ripples of a substantial fall in prices could be felt throughout London, while a return to negative numbers in house price reports could damage sentiment beyond the capital. While PCL&apos;s relentless rise has its problems, so too would a fall. \u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/20/china-credit-squeeze-manufacturing", "sentences": ["&quot;Nobody is entirely clear why the People&apos;s Bank of China is not coming in with liquidity,&quot; said Fraser Howie, the Singapore-based managing director of CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-20T20:18:30Z", "title": "China worsens credit squeeze as manufacturing output declines", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Business"], "article": "The cost of insuring against a default on Chinese sovereign debt soared on Thursday as China&apos;s central bank worsened a credit squeeze by refusing to inject cash into the financial system. Credit default swaps (CDS) on five-year bonds rose by 33 basis points to 133bps, according to financial data firm Markit, as Chinese officials signalled a determination to rein in risky lending practices. The People&apos;s Bank of China increased the pressure on lenders this week by removing Rmb2bn (\u00a3211m) from the market amid mounting concerns over the sustainability of a credit boom driven by the Chinese shadow banking system. The announcement had an immediate impact: short-term interest rates spiked and the sale of 10-year government bonds hit its lowest level since last year. Interbank borrowing costs hit their highest level in six years, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong and the Shanghai SE Composite Index both dropped by nearly 3%. Markit&apos;s director of credit research, Gavan Nolan, said the CDS widening was a &quot;huge move&quot;. He said: &quot;Only at the peak of the financial crisis have we seen moves of this size.&quot; The CDS jump means that the cost of insuring against a default on $10m of Chinese sovereign debt has climbed overnight from $100,000 to $133,000. The news came amid further bleak economic indicators for the world&apos;s second largest economy. The country&apos;s manufacturing activity hit a nine-month low in June, down from 49.2 to 48.3, according to HSBC&apos;s flash purchasing managers&apos; index, with a reading below 50 indicating contraction. Last year, China&apos;s economy slowed to its lowest rate in 13 years, mainly due to a drop in demand for exports from the US and Europe. Analysts say that China may narrowly miss its projected GDP growth target of 7.5% this year, as the country continues its transition from an export-led economy to one based on consumption. &quot;Nobody is entirely clear why the People&apos;s Bank of China is not coming in with liquidity,&quot; said Fraser Howie, the Singapore-based managing director of CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. &quot;I see that it&apos;s a warning to the banks and the financial sector as a whole that they&apos;re trying to clamp down on misuse of capital.&quot; On Wednesday, China&apos;s central government urged banks to contain financial risks and do more to support economic reforms. Analysts say that the message, delivered after a meeting led by premier Li Keqiang, imply that the country&apos;s credit shortage may last for at least another month. &quot;After Li&apos;s statement yesterday, the market now sees the crunch lasting longer. Until after mid-July, liquidity won&apos;t get better significantly,&quot; Zhou Hao, a Shanghai-based economist at Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group, told Bloomberg. Zhang Zhiwei, economist at Nomura International in Hong Kong, told AFP: &quot;We believe the government is committed to tolerating short-term pain to achieve its policy objectives - containing financial risks and secure sustainable growth in the long term.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/21/peter-forbes-rereading-albert-einstein", "sentences": ["The journey also took in brief visits to\u00a0Barcelona, Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong, ending in Palestine."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-21T09:00:00Z", "title": "Peter Forbes: rereading Einstein's collected papers", "tags": ["History", "Books", "Culture", "Autobiography and memoir", "Science and nature"], "article": "Japan and gyroscopes, refrigerators and impressionistic travel writing \u2013 these are not topics one would associate with Albert Einstein.

Add to that the wonderful countryside, sailing \u2013 enviable.&quot; This\u00a0was a\u00a0response to the offer by Einstein&apos;s friend, the inventor and businessman Hermann Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe, of work\u00a0and a home in Kiel, away from pressures that plagued him in Berlin after the first world war. The joy of the Collected Papers, which has now reached the 13th volume and the year 1922, is that it reveals these lesser known facets of this extraordinary man, allowing us to go beyond the famous mask. &quot;Mild, intoxicating air. Steel-colored sea. Italian suggestion of solid ground diffusely cloudy. Japanese woman crawling about with children. They look rosy and bedazzled, almost as if (schematic) stylised. Black-eyed, black-haired, large-headed, pattering.&quot; This is from the lengthy travel diary of 1922/3, and presents an unfamiliar figure, to say the least: an Einstein who sounds more like a painter taking notes for a composition. As Kevin Jackson has pointed out in\u00a0Constellation of Genius, 1922 was Modernism Year One; both The Waste Land and Ulysses were published that year. Scientific and artistic modernism were more or less contemporaneous, although on the Jackson principle, Modernist Science Year One would have to be 1905, Einstein&apos;s annus mirabilis when, in the space of three and a half months, he wrote three epochal papers, one of which won him the Nobel prize, one confirmed beyond all doubt the existence and size of atoms, and the other introduced the mind, space and time-bending concept of special relativity. The label Modernism Year One sits uneasily on Germany in 1922, where the reaction against all things modern, Jewish and left-wing was beginning to\u00a0congeal into the horror that would emerge as Nazism. Einstein, the man who, just as much as Picasso or Stravinsky, ushered in modernism, knew this only too well. The German republic, formed after Germany&apos;s defeat and the Kaiser&apos;s abdication in 1918, faced enormous economic and political problems, as the war&apos;s victors sought unfeasibly large reparations. Hitler had already been installed as leader of the Nazi party in Munich in the summer of 1921. On 24 June 1922, in a portent of what was to come, the foreign minister Walter Rathenau was assassinated by\u00a0right-wing extremists. Rathenau was Jewish and had just signed the Rapallo\u00a0treaty with communist Russia. Einstein was friendly with Rathenau and was deeply affected by the killing. As a lifelong pacifist and self-proclaimed &quot;international person&quot;, he had been horrified at the extreme nationalistic mania engendered by the war even among scientific colleagues. In October 1914, 93 leading German intellectuals, including some of Einstein&apos;s closest colleagues such as\u00a0Max Planck, signed a declaration, &quot;Call\u00a0to the Civilised World&quot;, popularly known as the &quot;Manifesto of the 93&quot;, which denied all allegations of German atrocities in the invasion of Belgium in\u00a01914. Einstein was involved in a counter manifesto, approaching various Prussian Academy luminaries for support, and was completely unsuccessful, lamenting: &quot;Only men of\u00a0extraordinary independence of character seem able to resist the pressure of prevailing opinion. There does not seem one single man of that calibre in the Academy.&quot; After the experimental vindication of Relativity in 1919, science itself had become a battleground, with some German physicists, led by Philipp Lenard, rejecting Relativity in favour of &quot;sound German spirit&quot;. In 1921 Lenard had written a book, Ether and Unether, expressing these views, and Hitler had written an article stating: &quot;Science, once our greatest pride, is\u00a0today being taught by Hebrews, for\u00a0whom \u2026 science is only a means towards a deliberate, systematic poisoning of our nation&apos;s soul.&quot; Lenard was to become Hitler&apos;s &quot;Chief of Aryan\u00a0Science&quot;. For a supposed ivory-tower scientist, Einstein had an impressive record of social and political engagement. Later, in 1933, soon after arriving in America as an exile from Nazism, he instigated the foundation of the International Rescue Committee, still flourishing and soon to be headed by David Miliband. He also worked hard to help establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In\u00a01921 he toured America with Chaim Weizmann (later to be Israel&apos;s first president), drumming up support for such Zionist causes. But he had reservations, writing to his great friend the Dutch physicist Paul Ehrenfest: &quot;The Zionists are shameless and importunate; I have a hard time adopting the appropriate position in each instance, considering that I am, of\u00a0course, well-disposed to the cause.&quot; Einstein could not escape being regarded as a figurehead for world Jewry, but he did reject the post of President of Israel when it was offered in 1952. In 1922, Einstein&apos;s peace activism took the form of joining the League of\u00a0Nations committee on intellectual cooperation, but he knew he did not possess the negotiation skills essential to political life, and all his attempts at such intervention led to frustration. He resigned from the committee in July, only to rejoin and then leave for good in March 1923. Of this first resignation he wrote to Marie Curie: &quot;I perceived that very strong anti-Semitism prevails among those I to some extent have to represent at the League of Nations; and\u00a0generally there is a mentality that makes me unsuited to be the representing and intermediary person.&quot; When he was warned, following Rathenau&apos;s murder, that his own life might be in danger, he decided that, whatever his long-term plans, he would spend some time away from Germany. From October 1922 to March 1923 he toured, principally in Japan at\u00a0the invitation of his Japanese publisher. Japan might seem an unlikely home-from-home for a German Jew, but Einstein was entranced by the delicacy of Japanese art and architecture, the grace of the people, the social cohesion. He believed in a\u00a0culture of aesthetic and moral harmony that clearly did not exist in Germany. He found Japanese music somewhat wanting, because the element of harmony that coursed through and gave impetus to western music was missing, but the people, the architecture and the social climate he found enchanting, declaring: &quot;For the first time I have seen a healthy human society whose members are absorbed in it.&quot; All of this would, within a decade, curdle, and a brutalised Japan would become an ally of Nazi Germany. But this does not invalidate Einstein&apos;s verdict on the culture he observed. The journey also took in brief visits to\u00a0Barcelona, Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong, ending in Palestine. He found the voyage, during which he was free of\u00a0the many pressures of Germany, stimulating for his science, and the procession of scenes from so many un-Germanic places brought out the aesthete in him. So absorbing was the experience that the award of the Nobel prize, the ceremony for which he missed because of the trip, went unmentioned in his diary. Einstein was a man of broad culture: music was always vital to him, and even in the hurly-burly of his early fame, when, as he said, &quot;the great crowd seized possession of me&quot;, he managed to arrange to play his violin in\u00a0string quartets with musical friends. Fame meant that he could try to advance causes he believed in, such as international scholarly and scientific collaboration. But left to himself, he valued above all his circle of friends, mostly from his days in Switzerland. He was a theorist, who did his greatest work while a patent clerk with no access to a laboratory. He is famous for his thought experiments, not hard, bench-top, real-time experiments. So\u00a0he has become the epitome of the unpractical thinker. His pacifism and physical appearance reinforced the image of an idealist dreamer. But Einstein was deeply interested in machines. In the 1950s he wrote: &quot;I\u00a0\u2026\u00a0never ceased to concern myself with technical matters. This was of benefit also to my scientific research.&quot; Einstein worked with Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe on improved designs for ships&apos; gyrocompasses as a co-patentee. He also took out other patents, notably for a design of refrigerator (co-patentee Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, later to be the key founder of the Manhattan project to produce the atom bomb). The invention of fluorocarbons in 1928 meant that the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd fridge never caught on, but it is curious to contemplate that the theorist of relativity might well also have had an appliance in every kitchen. In the 1922 papers we see the practical Einstein at work with Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe in a patent dispute with the American Elmer Sperry concerning the gyroscope; Einstein gives expert witness in the patent hearings. Given his background in patents this is not so surprising, but it gives a frisson to hear him switch from debating space-time to urging Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe to &quot;plate the aluminium sphere with a more precious metal&quot; or to find a means of &quot;applying a layer of graphite&quot;. This is trial-and-error work, as far removed as possible from contemplating whether or not &quot;God plays dice&quot;. Ansch\u00fctz-Kaempfe wrote to Einstein&apos;s colleague Arnold Sommerfeld, stating that &quot;weary of Berlin and everything connected with it&quot;, Einstein &quot;wants to\u00a0go into technology&quot;. One technology he never went into,\u00a0although popular myth suggests otherwise, is nuclear fission. The equation E=mc2 proposes the enormous energetic potential of matter, but only in the most general way. Einstein&apos;s scientific biographer wrote that &quot;to say that this made possible the construction of nuclear weapons is like saying that the invention of the alphabet caused the Bible to be written&quot;. What Einstein did\u00a0do was use his influence to alert President Roosevelt to the danger that Germany would acquire an atom bomb. Einstein&apos;s genius didn&apos;t lie in one over-developed faculty \u2013 as the crass researchers who stole his brain for analysis believed \u2013 but in a broader-than-usual range of competencies. He\u00a0was mathematician, physicist, engineer, philosopher, musician and social and political activist, and he had\u00a0a highly developed visual artistic sense. He attributed his findings to his\u00a0intense &quot;curiosity, obsession, and\u00a0sheer perseverance&quot;, claiming: &quot;I\u00a0myself have no special talents&quot;. And\u00a0he attributed his elucidation of relativity to his slow development, asking questions as an adult that children might toy with only to abandon as they grow up (he was 16 when he had the first intuition of the\u00a0relativity paradoxes). Einstein is the classic example of a man who &quot;hears\u00a0a\u00a0different drummer&quot;. And he remained true to this: he stepped to\u00a0the music he\u00a0heard &quot;however measured or far away&quot;. And far away for him included the deepest recesses of space-time, a place no one before even knew existed. \u2022 Nanoscience: Giants of the Infinitesimal by Peter Forbes and Tom Grimsey will be published in October. \u2022 This article was amended on 24 June 2013.

For Boeing, this is a further opportunity to restore the reputation and fortunes of a carbon fibre miracle that briefly took on the air of an industrial disaster when burning batteries grounded the fleet in early 2013. Its gestation has been public and painful: after endless delays in production, the hype over its maiden voyages gave way to safety concerns that grew until aviation regulators took the fleet out of service. The 787 did not return to the skies, with modified batteries, until late April. But airlines haven&apos;t lost their lust for a wide-bodied plane with the fuel efficiency and range of a much larger model \u2013 and one that also promises more peace for passengers and bystanders. As British airports push to expand, noise levels may prove particularly relevant and backers of Heathrow&apos;s expansion will welcome a quieter presence over west London. Boeing&apos;s arch-rival, Airbus, has not revelled in its competitor&apos;s discomfort. Before the Dreamliner saga, the Franco-German business was in the headlines for persistent delays in producing its A380 superjumbo, which then endured high-profile mishaps once it entered service. The discovery of cracks in the wings of the A380 fleet \u2013 in the wake of an engine blowout on a passenger flight in 2010 \u2013 undermined the allure of a plane that represented the cutting edge of commercial aviation before the Dreamliner came along. With perfect timing, Airbus has unveiled its response to the Dreamliner&apos;s return \u2013 the A350. The first of these slightly smaller jets took off from Toulouse on 14 June, in time for a swoop over the Paris Airshow last week. The Airbus plane is less revolutionary than the 787. It has similarly efficient engines and enough carbon-fibre to bring down the weight and the fuel bill, but not the battery-driven auxiliary systems that have plagued Boeing. For an airline industry wary of taking chances as profits tumble, it is a conservative compromise. At Paris Airbus sold 69 more A350s, mainly to established customers such as Singapore Airlines, along with a good batch for Air France, naturellement. But Boeing secured &quot;commitments&quot; for 102 Dreamliners at Paris as it finally revealed plans for the 787-10 \u2013 a stretched model with around 330 seats that will match the capacity of the smaller A350s, entering service in 2018. Randy Tinseth, Boeing&apos;s vice-president of marketing, says the battery problems had delayed the go-ahead despite interest from customers. But he adds: &quot;There is a little bit of magic in that aircraft because of the experience it gives passengers ... The more the airplane is out there in the air, the better it will do in the market because people just love it.&quot; The crucial people who &quot;love it&quot; are airlines who see a way into new long-haul markets on a lighter, fuel-efficient plane. Airports, meanwhile, think it can change the way planners view the economics of certain routes. In Britain this adds to the debate on whether, and where, to expand London&apos;s crowded airports. Gatwick trumpeted the merits of the &quot;hub-busting&quot; Dreamliner that Thomson Airways will operate from the airport, claiming its arrival meant that the decades ahead would shift airlines away from the &quot;hub and spokes&quot; model \u2013 where passengers fly in on short-haul planes then transfer to a long-haul flight. That is the business plan for the UK&apos;s biggest airport, Heathrow. But the Dreamliner gives the likes of Gatwick a chance to offer economically competitive long-haul services with just one runway. For Heathrow, even more significant is the arrival of BA&apos;s first A380 on 4\u00a0July. A hole has already been carved in the entrance to the BA hangar, to allow the tailfin of the giant plane to squeeze through. This is the plane of Heathrow&apos;s future \u2013 doubly so if expansion plans are thwarted. With passengers connecting at the hub, it can load ever greater numbers on a single take-off. Where demand is high, such as on transatlantic routes, the numbers can make sense for airline and airport alike \u2013 and potentially for Londoners under the flight path, with the A380 promising to be far quieter than the Boeing 747. With Boeing&apos;s own superjumbo heading for extinction because of the advent of the A380, it&apos;s perhaps unsurprising that Tinseth is sniffy about the A380 and its prospects for solving airport capacity issues. &quot;I could take every passenger on a wide-body today, put them on an A380, and that&apos;s not going to address the issue,&quot; he says. &quot;The way we see the market still headed is more fragmentation ... more flights to more places, rather than bigger and bigger airplanes. That really provides benefit to the passenger because it dramatically reduces their flight times.&quot; Airbus, and plenty of aviation analysts, remain confident about the future of the A380, but it is heavily reliant on one customer. Emirates has ordered 90 A380s and transformed its Dubai airport home to accommodate a plane whose economics match the strategy of the airline and its host hub airport. Only 20 A380s were sold at Paris, to a leasing company, Doric. While the battle lines are being drawn, many airlines are happy to pitch their tents in the middle. BA and Singapore Airlines have announced carefully balanced orders from both manufacturers in recent months. Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley, says that when planning future fleets, &quot;you&apos;re never quite sure what would suit you best&quot;. The bottom line is the cost and revenue generated per seat per kilometre. &quot;Those might sound like quite simple questions but they&apos;re not: the number of people on the plane influences the weight, then the fuel ... Frequency and speed might mean you can raise fares. So airlines are reluctant to commit \u2013 they&apos;re hedging their bets. It also lets you drive a hard bargain.&quot; This negotiating tactic was claimed by easyJet to bring in its own Paris deal although low-cost carriers generally prefer to run as few aircraft types as possible to minimise crew training and maintenance costs. McNeill says that, to make the sums add up, Boeing would have had to go some distance to undercut Airbus, whose planes are the only ones easyJet now flies. With such deals potentially valued at tens of billions of dollars, the finely balanced corporate battle has a wider impact: prime minister David Cameron was quick to tweet congratulations to Airbus for the A350 take-off &quot;securing 6,200 UK jobs&quot; \u2013 reflecting the fact that all Airbus wings are made in the UK. Meanwhile, as befits two heavyweights, there was, before Paris, an edge detectable in Tinseth&apos;s voice as he talked of the &quot;strong rivalry&quot; and accused Airbus of holding back orders for the show. By the time of the show he had upped the rhetoric to claim that Boeing was outmanoeuvring Airbus: &quot;We&apos;ve got them boxed and bracketed.&quot; John Leahy, chief operating officer for Airbus, retorted: &quot;Our A350 XWB has been outselling the 787 by better than two to one over the past five years. In addition our [short- haul] A320neo family retains a 60% market share lead. That&apos;s a corner I want to stay boxed into.&quot; And the final score in this Paris match? Airbus pipped Boeing with deals worth $68.7bn, for 466 passenger jets. Boeing notched $66.4bn for 442 planes. The running total for 2013, meanwhile, has Airbus ahead by 734 planes to 692.

But the thickest haze recorded by the city state in over 30 years is expected to return periodically until steady rains come in September, said meteorologists. As Indonesia deployed planes and a fourth helicopter to help douse the fires in Riau province, Sumatra, much of southern Malaysia was shrouded in thick smog. The pollution index in the capital Kuala Lumpur rose close to the officially &quot;very unhealthy&quot; 200 level for the first time, but registered up to 746 elsewhere, well above 300, the level considered &quot;hazardous&quot;. Independent analysis of Nasa fire maps suggest that there are still over 800 fires burning, many in former peat forests near Pekanbaru. Many of the hotspots identified by satellite are in what appears to be the concession areas of some of the world&apos;s largest palm oil and pulp and paper companies, some of which are owned by Singaporean and Malaysian families. But interpretations have differed of who is responsible for setting the fires. According to the World Resources Institute in Washington, which has overlaid government maps of Indonesian oil palm, logging and timber concessions onto publicly-available US Active Fire Data satellite maps to pinpoint the location of fires, relatively few have occurred in protected areas and selective logging concessions.     A thick haze makes Kuala Lumpur's skyline barely visible. Malaysia has declared emergency in southern parts after Indonesia's forest fires led to record level of pollution.  Photograph: Lai Seng Sin/AP    &quot;Half of the fires are burning on timber and oil palm plantations. Although it is illegal for companies in Indonesia to start forest or land fires, several companies have used fires for land clearing in the past. It will be important to gather more detailed information about the exact location of the fires and their causes, which could have important implications for the companies and government agencies involved,&quot; said Nigel Sizer of WRI. &quot;According to available official data, companies that are part of the Sinar Mas and Raja Garuda Mas (RGM) groups own the concessions licenses where the largest numbers of fire alerts are found. Together, these two groups account for more than 50 % of the fires across all concessions,&quot; said WRI. But Greenpeace in Jakarta overlaid the same US satellite data with other government concession maps and concluded that the fires were mostly in palm oil plantations rather than in the concessions of pulp and paper companies. &quot;The lack of government transparency makes it very hard for independent monitoring: concession maps are incomplete, data is lacking and we clearly have weak enforcement of laws,&quot; said Greenpeace southeast Asia forest campaigner, Yuyun Indradi. Indonesian ministers on 22 June officially blamed eight companies owned by Malaysian investors working in Riau but used only their initials. However, 24 hours before that a senior Indonesian presidential aide named Sinar Mas and Asia Pacific Resources International (April), one of the world&apos;s largest pulp and paper companies, in connection with the fires. However, April was not among those eight named by ministers [see footnote]. Both companies responded at the weekend saying that fires on their land had been started outside their zones but had now been contained. Other international companies with plantation interests in Indonesia include Wilmar International and Sime Darby. Both have denied setting fires in their concession areas. In a statement, April said: &quot;We have now completed a review of the satellite imagery and have verified by direct field inspection that there are currently three fires in our concessions covering approximately 20 hectares. These fires have been contained and our fire fighters are working to extinguish them. All fires ... originally started outside of their concession areas and had spread into concessions.

Photograph: Beawiharta/Reuters    But Greenpeace rejected their statements andf called on the companies to stop the drainage and development on peatlands and ensure palm oil in their supply chains is free from forest destruction. &quot;Palm oil giants such as Sime Darby and Wilmar International can&apos;t just wash their hands of responsibility for these crimes and hide behind their zero burning policies. These types of companies created the conditions for this disaster by draining and clearing peatland,&quot; said Bustar Maitar, head of the Indonesia Forest Campaign at Greenpeace International. Indonesia has launched an investigation into the fires which is due to report within a week, but the country&apos;s national disaster management agency has said it thinks oil palm plantation companies are at least partly responsible. &quot;Since the fires are happening mostly on plantation lands, we believe there are plantation companies involved,&quot; said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency. Malaysia today called on Indonesia to stop &quot;finger-pointing&quot; after the Indonesian government blamed Malaysian companies working in Riau. &quot;They are saying Malaysian companies are involved but Indonesian companies are also involved,&quot; said Malaysia&apos;s natural resources and environment minister G Palanivel. Malaysia&apos;s foreign minister Anifah Aman added that whoever was responsible should be brought to book regardless of nationality. He said both large companies and smallholders have long used fire to clear forest and other land ahead of cultivation. Over 10m hectare of land has been cleared in the past 20 years but the Indonesian government renewed its two year moratorium on clear felling of rainforest in May, which should have reduced the use of fire considerably. Many companies have been able to get around the law because the moratorium only applies to new concessions. This years&apos; fires are thought to be particularly bad because of tinder-dry conditions. The last time that southeast Asia experienced anything similar was in 1997 when fires, mostly in Borneo, plagued much of the region for several months, caused numerous shipping and aviation accidents and left thousands suffering respiratory and heart problems. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 June 2013 to correct errors. Anifah Aman is a man and is foreign minister for Malaysia not Indonesia. It was a senior Indonesian presidential aide, not ministers, who named Sinar Mas and Asia Pacific Resources International (April) in connection with the fires. A spokeswoman for April has subsequently contacted the Guardian to deny that April bears any responsibility for the fires. A further amendment was made on 28 June 2013 to make clear that April&apos;s name was not among the eight companies named by ministers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jun/24/delta-completes-purchase-virgin-atlantic-stake", "sentences": ["The sale marks the end of Singapore Airlines&apos; financially disastrous investment in 49% of Virgin Atlantic, which it purchased for \u00a3600m in 1999, and has now sold for $360m (\u00a3224m) to Delta.", "Bastian said he was sure that the Atlanta-based Delta would not lose out in the same way as Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T17:04:13Z", "title": "Delta cleared to complete purchase of 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Business", "Virgin Atlantic", "Travel & leisure", "US news", "UK news"], "article": "Virgin and Delta have vowed to become a &quot;formidable competitor&quot; on UK-US routes after the American airline was cleared to complete its purchase of a 49% stake of Sir Richard Branson&apos;s Atlantic carrier. The two companies announced a codesharing agreement on more than 100 routes as the start of a proposed joint venture that will, with competition clearance from US authorities, be fully realised in early 2014 and allow them to coordinate timetables to maximise profits. The deal will see Delta gain the greater access it has long sought to London&apos;s Heathrow, while Virgin Atlantic will be able to funnel passengers directly on to Delta&apos;s vast US network. The tie-up and extra traffic on lucrative routes will bolster Virgin&apos;s finances after two years of heavy losses. Delta&apos;s president, Ed Bastian, said the deal was a game-changer when it came to competing on transatlantic routes. &quot;Heathrow is a hugely important market and one where Delta has long wanted greater access. Our options were limited, so when the opportunity came along for a deal with Virgin we moved quickly. &quot;As we unite two leading global airline brands in an innovative partnership that focuses on delivering enhanced benefits and services for our customers, we also become a more formidable competitor across the Atlantic.&quot; He claimed that the partnership would &quot;drive great value, and not just for shareholders&quot;, adding that employees and customers would also benefit. The sale marks the end of Singapore Airlines&apos; financially disastrous investment in 49% of Virgin Atlantic, which it purchased for \u00a3600m in 1999, and has now sold for $360m (\u00a3224m) to Delta. Bastian said he was sure that the Atlanta-based Delta would not lose out in the same way as Singapore. &quot;It&apos;s really simple, from a commercial standpoint. There&apos;s 20 times the volume across the Atlantic.&quot; Craig Kreeger, chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, promised that despite the predictions of rival IAG boss Willie Walsh, Delta would not subsume Branson&apos;s airline. He said: &quot;Some people questioned our brand identity. I am here today to wholeheartedly reiterate that the Virgin Atlantic brand will continue true to its roots.&quot; The agreement, he said, allowed Virgin &quot;to stretch our wings even further, and continue innovating. We know that we will be bigger and better together.&quot; Bastian said: &quot;The reason we&apos;re investing is that we think it&apos;s a wonderful brand. We&apos;re not interested in doing anything that will change that.&quot; The codeshare will come into force from 3 July and will give each airline&apos;s customers access to the other&apos;s loyalty schemes and lounges. Combined, they will offer 23 weekday flights to North America from Heathrow \u2013 nine to New York, and direct daily services to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, with Seattle likely to follow. The European commission and the US\u00a0justice department gave clearance last\u00a0week. Approval from the US transport department is expected by the end of this year, allowing a full joint venture in early 2014. This would, said Kreeger, allow the two to &quot;develop a collective schedule&quot; rather than a competitive one, spacing flights throughout the day rather than clashing at peak times. Virgin and Delta announced the plans to enter into a joint venture in December, targeting the market dominance on transatlantic flights of British Airways and American Airlines, who have been operating in a similar way since early 2011."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/25/the-fiver-carlo-ancelotti-real-psg", "sentences": ["&quot;Five days ago I was talking to Rio Ferdinand in Singapore and he told me that Alex Ferguson is a big admirer of Lolo [ie Blanc] and that he [Ferdinand] was surprised that he [Blanc] was not approached to replace him [Ferguson],&quot; revealed David Ginola [him] in an interview with Le Parisien [newspaper]."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-25T15:16:05Z", "title": "The Fiver | Stock falling faster than Felix Baumgartner | Paul Doyle", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "GROSSE POINTE BLANC It is hardly the most romantic story ever to come out of Paris. After Carlo Ancelotti bailed to take charge of Real Madrid, the eyes of PSG and Laurent Blanc met across a crowded room \u2026 then the club quickly turned away and began ogling everyone else. But Fabio Capello and Guus Hiddink rejected their advances and Roberto Mancini, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas and Michael Laudrup all ducked for cover. These were galling snubs for a blinged-up club that fancies itself as one of the most desirable in Europe. Hell, Shecond-Shoish Schteve didn&apos;t even make an enquiry and Tony Adams didn&apos;t so much as demand a spacious office with an ergonomic armchair and a box of snazzy highlighter pens. So the eyes of the chastened club alighted once again on pretty much the only remaining person in the room. And lo, Blanc pulled. &quot;Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to announce the appointment of Laurent Blanc as coach for the next two years,&quot; insisted the club in a statement today. &quot;He will take charge of the squad on 1 July 2013 for the start of pre-season training.&quot; The deal provides for a review at the end of the first campaign, allowing the club to jilt Blanc if he doesn&apos;t rise to the challenge, which is &quot;to build on last season and continue the club&apos;s ascendency towards the summits of the European game&quot;. Two years ago Blanc would have been considered the ideal man to do just that, as his reputation glowed like radioactive fish after he led a stylish Bordeaux side to the 2009 French title and then took over France in the wake of their 2010 World Cup fiasco and quickly revitalised them, going 23 matches unbeaten up to Euro 2012. But his reign at Les Bleus ended badly, as he fell out with egotistical players and lapsed into a timid brand of play, both of which sent his stock falling faster than Felix Baumgartner, leading to a year of unemployment. How he will deal with the stars at PSG \u2013 and the regular input of Leonardo, the ubiquitous director of football \u2013 remains to be seen. Clearly some folks are convinced he is smart enough to learn from mistakes while retaining the qualities that once led many to tip him for managerial greatness. &quot;Five days ago I was talking to Rio Ferdinand in Singapore and he told me that Alex Ferguson is a big admirer of Lolo [ie Blanc] and that he [Ferdinand] was surprised that he [Blanc] was not approached to replace him [Ferguson],&quot; revealed David Ginola [him] in an interview with Le Parisien [newspaper]. Obviously he [Ferguson] thought that he [David Moyes] was better. Checking the soundness of that judgement will be one of the intriguing features of next season.

But Standard Chartered has added 35p to \u00a314.45 after the Asia-focused bank issued a positive trading update. It said business had accelerated in the second quarter, meaning its first half income was expected to grow at around 5% - or at a mid single digit rate, as the bank puts it. Hong Kong, Africa and India are growing strongly, it said, offset by some weakness in Korea and Singapore. But impairment charges and a 75% rise in the UK bank levy over the period would see operating profits grow by a low single digit rate. Chief executive Peter Sands said:  This is a good performance against a backdrop of ongoing turbulence in the global economy, with the group&apos;s second quarter showing an acceleration over the first quarter of 2013.   In a buy note Ian Gordon at Investec said:  After some disappointment at the first quarter interim management statement just 7 weeks ago, despite turmoil in Asian markets in the intervening period and notwithstanding further foreign exchange headwinds, today&apos;s trading update offers fresh encouragement. Management is comfortable with 2013 consensus pretax profit ($8.02bn) which, yet again, illustrates the substantial cost flexibility to offset known margin/foreign exchange pressures on revenues. Impairments (ex-Korea) are benign. Despite challenges, Standard Chartered remains on course for an 11th straight year of record revenues/profits.

But gold and silver continued to fall back on the prospect of an end to American&apos;s quantitative easing programme, as hinted at by US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke last week. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said:  Since the crisis of 2008, gold prices were driven higher by QE as excessive money printing by the Fed diluted the value of the US dollar.  That&apos;s all changing now with Fed tapering on the cards, a resurging US economy which has bumped up the US dollar. Market participants are dumping the yellow metal in favour for other assets that offer attractive long-term value, such as US equities exposed to the domestic recovery.

Among the mid-caps transport group Stagecoach has accelerated 13.9p to 313.4p after it reported an 8% rise in full year profit to \u00a3218.9m, helped by strong performances from its UK and US buses. Losses rose at its rail business although Virgin Rail, a joint venture with Richard Branson&apos;s group, made a profit, albeit lower than last year. Lower down the market Real Good Foods jumped nearly 4.5% to 43.75p. The company, which owns sugar distributor Napier Brown, Haydens Bakery and ingredient companies Renshaw and R&amp;W Scott, said full year profits climbed from \u00a34.9m to \u00a36.7m. All divisions recorded positive earnings, with improved performances from Haydens and Scott in particular. It has invested in a new site at Stallingborough for its sugar business, while it has also been developing its baking brands which include Whitworths.

Analysts at the company&apos;s broker Shore Capital said:  Real Good Food Company has reported solid progress in its preliminary results for the year, in our view. Looking ahead, it has strong partner in Omnicane to support its cost effective supply of sugar in the medium-term. We also believe it now has a robust operational infrastructure to help drive the business forward in the coming years with divisional management teams in place.

Someone says the word &apos;bastard&apos; so straightaway the game has gone to a 12 certificate in my mind. Then at eight minutes and 28 seconds, Lara gets eaten by a wolf\u2026&quot; I&apos;m sitting with Jack Davies a games examiner at the Video Standards Council. Jack Davies is not his real name: apparently, if I use that, he&apos;ll be inundated with questions and complaints about previous Pegi ratings \u2013 and with only three dedicated game examiners here, that&apos;s the last thing he needs. He&apos;s picked Tomb Raider to show me the process the organisation goes through to rate games. Lara Croft&apos;s gruesome demise at the mouth of a lupine aggressor has just earned the game a Pegi 16 certificate. But there is more controversial fare to come.  Video game certification has always been a hot topic . From the very first BBFC rated title \u2013 the 1986 adventure Dracula \u2013 to the temporary banning of violent racer Carmageddon to the GTA: San Andreas &apos;Hot Coffee&apos; scandal, gaming content has troubled censors, politicians and free speech campaigners the world over. Earlier this week, the Australian Classification Board announced that it had refused to grant the violent gangster romp Saint&apos;s Row IV a release license, effectively banning it in the country. The product was censored for its celebration of illicit drug use as well as &quot;visual depictions of implied sexual violence which are not justified by context&quot;. Could something similar happen to this or any other controversial game in Britain?  Housed within an unremarkable modern office block, at the edge of a small business park in Borehamwood, the VSC was set up in 1989 to ensure that the film industry was abiding by the 1984 video recordings act. In 1993, however, it approached the UK games trade body ELSPA to suggest a voluntary ratings system for entertainment software in Britain. Then in 2001, a meeting of ratings boards throughout Europe led to the introduction of Pegi, the system that now controls the age rating of retail games in 31 countries around the continent. The VSC is one of two administrators, alongside NICAM in Holland, charged with carrying out the ratings process. Although the BBFC originally also examined games in the UK, the dual system was considered too confusing, and the Digital Recordings Act of 2010, enlisted Pegi as the sole arbiter of games classification. Throughout Europe, Pegi is recognised as the standard rating for games, and in certain countries (including the UK and Netherlands) all titles are legally required to display a rating on their packaging. To submit their games for certification, publishers must become a member of the organisation. The first part of the process is an online questionnaire, which seeks to establish the product&apos;s content. Developers begin by answering questions relating to 18-rated content: does it contain graphic violence, violence toward innocent bystanders, or violence against vulnerable or defenseless characters? Is there sexual activity which shows genitalia? Is there rape? Is there glamorisation of illegal drugs? If all the responses are negative, the studio moves to the 16-rated questions, where less explicit forms of violence, sexual content or drug use are covered. And so on, down to Pegi 3, effectively the video game equivalent of a U certificate.  If the game warrants a &apos;yes&apos; to any of the age rating questions, the process stops. The developer has to confirm that they have accurately represented all the content in the game and that they are aware of everything the player will see on the disk. The product is then put on to Pegi&apos;s online ratings system and the process of analysis and confirmation begins. If Pegi 18, 16 or 12 sections of the online form have been marked with a &apos;yes&apos;, the product comes to the VSC; the rest go to NICAM.  Hands-on evaluation From here, developers have to send in a working copy of the game (a few bugs doesn&apos;t matter, but it has to feature all the content of the final release), as well as representational video footage. The latter must include all the cinematics and cut-scenes as well as what Davies calls, &quot; a decent chunk of gameplay&quot;. &quot;If it&apos;s something like a port of Street Fighter where the play is identical throughout, you only need 20-30 minutes of video,&quot; he says. &quot;But with something like Tomb Raider or Bioshock Infinite, we&apos;ll need two or three hours of gameplay footage on top of all the cut-scenes. This will be used in 70-80% of the examination process.&quot; The video is vital due to the time restraints of the process. Alongside the three full-time examiners, there are several staff who are trained up and can pitch in at busy periods, but even then there&apos;s a lot to get through. Out of the 1,813 titles rated by Pegi in 2012, 812 were handled here, so the team can&apos;t possibly play through dozens of 20-hour action adventures in their entirety. The video content can also be uploaded onto the Pegi system for all the country representatives to see and to provide lasting reference material. &quot;On the system, we note all the sections of a game that would cause a particular age rating,&quot; says Davies. &quot;That way, before we even play it we have a good idea of what it contains. Also we ask for video evidence of all the &apos;yes&apos; answers from the questionnaire \u2013 that&apos;s useful so we can tell if the developer has misinterpreted any of the questions.&quot; This is a key point. If a developer fails to declare adult content and is awarded a lower age rating, they&apos;ve effectively broken the code of conduct and face a stiff fine \u2013 up to \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3212,000) for a first offence. &quot;Along with that you have an illegal product on sale, so you&apos;re going to have withdraw all those boxes from the shelves,&quot; says Davies.  Although Pegi provides corporate training and e-learning to help developers with certification, there are often misunderstandings with some of the terms. Let&apos;s take the phrase &apos;realistic looking violence toward humans&apos; for example. &quot;The way we judge violence isn&apos;t really based around the quality of the graphics,&quot; explains Davies. &quot;When we say we&apos;re looking for realistic-looking violence, it is about the reaction \u2013 the character has to react like they would in real-life. Also, it doesn&apos;t matter where the game is set \u2013 it could be space or medieval times \u2013 we don&apos;t take context into account. If a character gets punched and they respond by falling backwards, there doesn&apos;t necessarily have to be blood for a 16 certificate, they just need to respond realistically.&quot; Games v movie ratings Here, there&apos;s a crucial differentiation between game and movie rating. Films certification takes context into account \u2013 swearing is acceptable in a PG-13 release if it&apos;s used sparingly, for example, while extreme depictions of sex and violence may be justified in a 15 or 18 release if they&apos;re part of a strong narrative. In games, however, a single scripted swear word could be heard dozens of times by a player if they attempt the same section repeatedly, while story usually plays a more subordinate role to interactive action and therefore its contextual relevance is diminished. Everything that happens in a game is considered in isolation.  Another mistake developers often make when submitting gameplay footage is not considering elements of the content that sit outside the narrative action \u2013 the sorts of animations and interactions that examiners often only discover in a hands-on test with the code.  &quot;The developer will often play through the game just to complete a level,&quot; says Davies. &quot;They won&apos;t stop and see what every single weapon will do to a body. But I try all of them \u2013 sometimes explosive weapons will have different effects. I&apos;ve tested games that have aimed for a 16 rating, but then I throw a grenade and sure enough there are arms and legs flying everywhere. I have to go back to them and say &apos;you didn&apos;t show me that.&quot;  While playing Tomb Raider, he shows me how he purposely exposes the lead character to fire, to test her reaction \u2013 if it&apos;s pain and distress, that affects the rating. &quot;Obviously you&apos;re taking damage, but her skin isn&apos;t melting off \u2013 that&apos;s what I&apos;m looking for,&quot; says Davies. He also checks for the ability to inflict post-mortem damage on bodies \u2013 smashing in a skull with a baseball bat, maybe. This could put it into &apos;gross violence&apos; category. There&apos;s not much of this going on in the game we&apos;re playing. So why was Tomb Raider an 18? Before the game&apos;s release last year, there was controversy over a single sequence, referred to in an interview with the game&apos;s executive producer, where Lara is tied up and sexually threatened by a male captor. It turns out, however, that by Pegi rating standards, the moment was so fleeting it didn&apos;t register. &quot;I don&apos;t even think I marked it 16 for sexual violence,&quot; says Davies. &quot;It just didn&apos;t go far enough&quot;. No, Tomb Raider received an 18 certificate thanks to a mere handful of gory death animations. &quot;Most of the violence is 16-rated,&quot; continues Davies. &quot;But there&apos;s a particular part where Lara goes down a zip wire and, if you fail to jump off in time, she is impaled through the abdomen and jaw by spikes. That counts as gross violence. It&apos;s basically anything that makes you go, &apos;eugh&apos;&quot;.  According to Davies, developers are told which sequences of their game have earned a higher rating, and they are given the option to edit and resubmit. If they disagree with the judgement, there is an appeals process that may eventually end up with the Pegi complaints board, a pool of independent experts including child psychologists, media experts and legal advisers who&apos;ll decide on the case. This board responds to appeals from both developers and members of the public, but only two or three cases a year ever get to them. Often, it&apos;s publishers querying whether their game depicts the sort of &apos;gross violence&apos; that earns an 18 rating. In 2011, Activision Blizzard successfully complained about the rating of Diablo III, contesting that although there is gore, it involves fantasy creatures and non-realistic reactions. The game was subsequently reduced from an 18 to a 16 rating. Banning games? So, back to Saint&apos;s Row IV. Could the game be banned in Europe under the Pegi system? The answer, for Britain at least, is effectively no. Pegi is a ratings system not a censorship board and has no remit to ban retail releases. However, in situations where a European member country has legislation that may be contravened in the product, Pegi will advise publishers that they may well be breaking laws.  &quot;The Pegi system doesn&apos;t usurp national legislation,&quot; explains VSC communications officer, Gianni Zamo. &quot;If a country has a particular piece of legislation that effects video games, then they may take action. The Italians were upset about Rule of Rose a few years ago, they felt it had child abuse elements, and were twitchy about that. But the Pegi system is not legally enforceable in that sense. Games can do anything as long as it&apos;s within the confines of the law.&quot; In the UK, video game content is governed by the 1984 Video Recordings Act and its subsequent updates, which Pegi has to take into account when rating games. &quot;We&apos;d be talking about paedophilia, or any form of discrimination likely to incite hatred,&quot; says operations director, Peter Darby. &quot;We&apos;ve got a chair and vice-chair who are designated by the secretary of state to make a decision on whether a game should be given a certificate for release in the UK or not. Obviously that doesn&apos;t effect the rest of Europe, that&apos;s just for the UK. But that&apos;s the process we would use to effectively ban a game in the UK. There&apos;s quite a long process leading up to that, though. We have an expert panel that will look at it and advise on whether it breaches the law or could be deemed harmful. We have Tanya Byron and Geoffrey Robertson QC and the psychologist Dr Guy Cumberbatch \u2013 they wouldn&apos;t make a decision, but they&apos;d look at the game and advise us on the sorts of things we need to take into account. Pegi is not a system that in itself bans games. But we will warn publishers to be careful where they release a title, because it could contravene laws.&quot; So what happens in the event of a controversy? Does the government start trying to question the process? &quot;The DCMS will never get involved in us coming to a rating decision,&quot; says director general Laurie Hall, a veteran of the home video business in the early 80s, when the video nasty controversy erupted. &quot;If Keith Vaz raises a question in parliament or whatever, they may ring us to ask what we have to say about it; we&apos;ll say our piece and that may be their reply to Vaz in parliament. But they&apos;re at arm&apos;s length.&quot; Online issues But Pegi is facing new challenges all the time. While it has jurisdiction over all games sold via high street retailers and online giants like Amazon, emerging digital market places such as iTunes and Steam do not require developers to sign up to the Pegi code of conduct. We&apos;re well into a new era in which games are distributed across the internet to a global user-base. The VSC has noticed that the number of examinations in the Pegi 3, 7 and 12 categories have dropped in recent years as casual and family titles migrate to smartphone and tablet platforms. How can a ratings system keep up with that?  Right now, the body is developing &apos;Pegi For Apps&apos; a streamlined voluntary version of the ratings procedure designed for smartphone developers who want to exhibit Pegi ratings with their digital products. There&apos;s currently no legal compulsion to do it, but Pegi&apos;s contention is it&apos;s better that publishers show they are being responsible, both to concerned parents and to governments who may well step in with mandatory classification systems if the digital gaming industry can&apos;t regulate itself.  Importantly, Pegi For Apps, doesn&apos;t just provide an age rating, it also introduces four new &apos;feature descriptors&apos; \u2013 the icons that come with a Pegi rating that show the sorts of content a game includes: In-App Purchases, Social Interaction, Location Data Sharing and Personal Data Sharing. These could well be invaluable to parents who are becoming more concerned about the risks of giving kids free rein over handheld devices. &quot;These descriptors won&apos;t affect the age rating, but we thought it was important to alert parents to these functions,&quot; explains communications manager, Dirk Bosmans. &quot;It&apos;s a first step to more information. These descriptors could later be implemented with parental controls so a parent could ensure that if a game has in-app purchase functionality, the child cannot buy it.&quot;  More ambitiously, Pegi is also working on an international aggregation system for content classification, named IARC. It&apos;s an online questionnaire for developers that&apos;ll spit out ratings for a whole range of countries. Pegi is working with North America&apos;s Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) as well as ratings boards in Brazil, Australia, Singapore, Japan and Korea. &quot;One global rating system is not possible, the standards are way too different \u2013 it would take us a century,&quot; concedes Brosmans. &quot;But this is a fairly easy solution. We&apos;ve been working on it for two years and we have a functioning model \u2013 there&apos;s a clear goal to implement it soon.&quot; It&apos;s unlikely there will ever be a completely inclusive global aggregation body, however. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll get the Iranian system,&quot; says Davies. &quot;It includes an age rating that goes up to &apos;25 and married&apos; \u2013 so there are certain games you can&apos;t play if you&apos;re 27 and unmarried. The country&apos;s trade body was at the Gamescom game conference last year \u2013 they had a big booth and they were giving out folders with all their content descriptors. They had one for &apos;hopelessness&apos; \u2026&quot; Darby continues, &quot;Russia is difficult to bring into IARC too because its ratings are culturally based. Will the game interfere with traditional family values? That&apos;s a problem we&apos;re facing with certain ratings bodies around the world.&quot; But away from publishers failing to disclose adult elements, and the trials of introducing age ratings into the digital marketplace, there&apos;s one over-riding difficulty that Pegi faces. &quot;Our biggest problem is getting parents to understand that these age ratings actually mean something,&quot; says Darby. &quot;When we give a rating it is genuine, but parents see the word &apos;game&apos; and to a lot of people that means it&apos;s for children. But it&apos;s not, many games are for adults. Personally, I think the problem is short-lived \u2013 there will come a stage where parents have grown up with games and will realise that some are unsuitable for young children.&quot; It is extremely unlikely then that Saint&apos;s Row IV will be banned in Europe. Germany has its own supplementary body, the USK, which tends to be stricter than most other countries, but certainly in Britain, Pegi doesn&apos;t seek to censor in this way and will only raise the alarm if content actually breaks the law. The statement provided by the Australian Classification Board reads: &quot;In the board&apos;s opinion, Saints Row IV, includes interactive, visual depictions of implied sexual violence which are not justified by context.&quot; However, as we have seen, context is irrelevant in the Pegi system. No doubt the examiners will have an interesting few days working their way through the game&apos;s crass and ridiculous litany of sexualised weapons and morally questionable cut-scenes. But the outcome is likely to be an 18 rating, and with a pile of other titles to get through, the focus will move swiftly on.  You can find out more about video game ratings at the Video Standards Council&apos;s dedicated website or at the Pegi home page. Britain&apos;s trade body UKIE also has a helpful site named Ask About Games, which is aimed at parents wanting to know more about age ratings, parental controls and safe family gaming."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/jun/26/ftse-100-two-day-rise-quantitative-easing-hopes", "sentences": ["Hong Kong, Africa and India are growing strongly, it said, offset by some weakness in Korea and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-26T16:24:18Z", "title": "FTSE 100 records best two day run since April on QE hopes but miners remain under pressure", "tags": ["Business", "Fresnillo", "Randgold Resources", "Anglo American", "Antofagasta", "Aberdeen Asset Management", "Lloyds Banking Group", "AstraZeneca", "Standard Chartered", "Tate and Lyle", "Next", "Icap", "Stagecoach", "TalkTalk", "Balfour Beatty"], "article": "Leading shares recorded their best two day rise since the end of April as investors continued to take heart from signs that central banks were not about to turn off the money taps. The FTSE 100 finished 63.57 points higher at 6165.48 having risen 72 points on Tuesday. After Monday&apos;s rout on worries about a possible credit crunch in China, the country&apos;s central bank calmed nerves by appearing to indicate it was prepared to act if necessary, and proved the point on Wednesday by injecting funds into a number of lenders to improve their liquidity. The Bank of England and the European Central Bank have both played down the idea of an early end to measures to stimulate the global economy in recent days. On Wednesday a revision to US GDP showed slower growth than expected, easing fears of the Fed ending its bond buying actions. But with precious metal prices continuing to fall as the dollar strengthened - gold is on track for its worst quarterly loss on record - and base metals coming under pressure on Chinese growth worries, mining shares were unwanted. Mexican silver miner Fresnillo fell 32p to 866.5p, the biggest loser in the leading index, while Randgold Resources dropped 125p to \u00a339.72. Anglo American lost 43p to \u00a312.56 and copper miner Antofagasta fell 17.5p to 801.5p. But Aberdeen Asset Management added 17.2p to 378.3p, making it the biggest riser in the FTSE 100, after a positive note from HSBC. The bank raised its rating from neutral to overweight, pointing out that Aberdeen&apos;s shares had fallen 28% since May. It came under pressure as markets were hit by uncertainty about the US Federal Reserve&apos;s quantitative easing programme and worries about China, hitting sentiment about its emerging market business. But HSBC said:  Aberdeen has a value-based investment approach and therefore in periods when markets are very strong, its funds tend to underperform the benchmarks and when markets are going backwards, its funds tend to outperform the benchmarks. With markets pulling back, investment performance for Aberdeen Equity funds improved significantly in May. Investment performance for Asia Pacific excluding Japan and Global Asia Pacific funds improved in May and probably also in June. Flows are likely to slow, however market expectations of outflows seem overdone. We believe the sell-off is overdone with the shares now trading at one-year forward PE of 11.4 times.   Lloyds Banking Group rose 1.24p to 62.48p following a report that Royal Bank of Canada was leading the race for its asset management business Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. But RBC&apos;s bid was likely to be below Lloyds&apos; target price of \u00a3400m to \u00a3500, said Financial News. France&apos;s Natixis and Australia&apos;s Macquarie had also been interested in the Lloyds business, said the report. AstraZeneca ended 50.5p higher at \u00a331.15 after it linked up with rival Roche in an effort to improve their drug development programmes, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The two have agreed to share data on early-stage drug programmes to try and speed up the development of effective medicines. They will both give information to UK business MedChemica, which specialises in pinpointing chemical structures which could lead to safety or efficacy problems. Standard Chartered rose 20.5p to 1430.5p after the Asia-focused bank issued a positive trading update. It said business had accelerated in the second quarter, meaning its first half income was expected to grow at around 5% - or at a mid single digit rate, as the bank puts it. Hong Kong, Africa and India are growing strongly, it said, offset by some weakness in Korea and Singapore. But impairment charges and a 75% rise in the UK bank levy over the period would see operating profits grow by a low single digit rate. A handful of companies went ex-dividend, including Tate and Lyle, down 12p at 801.5p, and Next, 28p lower at \u00a344.95. Among the mid-cap Icap shares were also quoted without the right to the shareholder payout but the interdealer broker was also hit by a downgrade from Societe Generale. It fell 33.2p to 353.6p as the bank moved its recommendation from buy to hold. Stagecoach accelerated 10.5p to 310p after it reported an 8% rise in full year profit to \u00a3218.9m, helped by strong performances from its UK and US buses. Losses rose at its rail business although Virgin Rail, a joint venture with Richard Branson&apos;s group, made a profit, albeit lower than last year. TalkTalk Telecom added 12.5p to 231.9p after a positive note from Morgan Stanley:  We think TalkTalk&apos;s free cash flow to equity can rebound 60% in 2015 from cost cutting and some upselling [eg moving Essentials customers to TalkTalk Plus TV]. Applying an 8% free cash flow to equity yield to our base case forecasts implies 280p. We upgrade to overweight from equal weight, with 25% upside to our new price target.  Balfour Beatty, which has been tipped as a possible takeover target, edged up 1.3p to 235.5p as the infrastructure group sold its stake in Exeter Airport, written down to zero in its books, to joint venture partner Rigby. Analyst Joe Brent at Liberum Capital called the move a further tidying up of Balfour&apos;s portfolio. He said:  [The deal will have] no material impact on profits. Yesterday Balfour announced the Hong Kong road contracts, worth 50% of \u00a3720m, spread mostly over the three years to 2017. The trade press reports today that Balfour is shortlisted on the \u00a3311m West of Duddon Sands transmission Link. This is all mildly positive. However, the company are as surprised as us by yesterday&apos;s 6% share price increase. There is some speculation about a bid for the company, which is certainly possible, given the strong positions, but not very likely. Whilst the business is relatively strong financially and diversified, we expect a weak first half, negative earnings momentum and a possible dividend cut.   Afren added 8.9p to 130.6p after the exploration group announced a better than expected oil discovery off Nigeria. Afren owns 22.86% of the block while Lekoil, which surged nearly 10% to 38.375p, has a 17% stake. Lower down the market Real Good Foods jumped 3% to 43.25p. The company, which owns sugar distributor Napier Brown, Haydens Bakery and ingredient companies Renshaw and R&amp;W Scott, said full year profits climbed from \u00a34.9m to \u00a36.7m. All divisions recorded positive earnings, with improved performances from Haydens and Scott in particular. It has invested in a new site at Stallingborough for its sugar business, while it has also been developing its baking brands which include Whitworths. Finally fashion brand Ted Baker fell 2.7% to \u00a316.80 as founder and chief executive Ray Kelvin raised \u00a320.4m by selling 1.2m shares - 2.82% - at \u00a317 each.

The multi-award winning band, who have chalked up millions of worldwide sales, are ranked number 14 in the celebrity 100, three places above the next highest ranked Brit, X Factor supremo Simon Cowell. Topping the list for the fifth time in total \u2013 but after two years at number two \u2013 is Oprah Winfrey, despite an $88m (\u00a357.4m) earnings drop since last year to $77m. Women make up six out of the top 10 (and 35 out of the top 100) but British singer Adele dropped out of the celebrity 100 after debuting at 24 last year. Forbes magazine said: &quot;Adele didn&apos;t have a tour in our time frame. For better or worse, tours are now the main source of income for musicians. Adele earned an Oscar for Skyfall, her first James Bond theme song, but with only an estimated $30m in earnings, it wasn&apos;t enough to land her on this year&apos;s Celebrity 100.&quot; The biggest factor affecting rankings is earnings over the last 12 months, but also how often each celebrity is mentioned in print and on TV, the strength of their internet presence and how they&apos;re viewed by US consumers. A new category of marketability was also introduced this year. Unsurprisingly, Justin Bieber, with almost 41 million Twitter followers, is adjudged to have the most social networking power by Forbes. Coldplay, criticised in the past by Johnny Rotten and Liam Gallagher among others for being boring, did not make the list last year and last featured at 35 in 2010. But the band&apos;s earnings were $64m over the past 12 months, thanks to a world tour that pulled in more than $3m per city. Forbes said the band&apos;s position \u2013 topped by only one other group, Bon Jovi, at number seven \u2013 was also boosted by the fact that Martin and his wife, Gwyneth Paltrow (number 71 in her own right), boast influential friends, including another power couple, Beyonc\u00e9 (number four) and Jay-Z (32). Forbes uses Starcount, a Singapore-based company that measures impact across social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google to give a sense of how popular each celebrity is on the internet. A marketability rank (1 to 100) is also assigned to each person by California-based market research firm E-Poll, based on opinion polling about 46 different attributes for 6,600 different celebrities. Another Briton, Fifty Shades Of Grey author EL James, is at number 42, with earnings put at $95m, after her books sold 70 million copies worldwide. Winfrey supplanted Jennifer Lopez, who fell to number 12, at the top of the list, with Lady Gaga in the runner-up position, up three from last year and film producer and director Steven Spielberg in third. After a two-year absence , Madonna re-entered at number five with earnings of $125m, the highest in the celebrity 100, thanks to a hugely successful world tour.

Malaysia wants to raise GDP per capita to $12,476 (about \u00a38,000) by 2020, in line with the World Bank&apos;s high-income status. But with GDP of $9,977 in 2011, there is still a way to go. While the goal may not seem outlandish, the struggle lies in overcoming the &quot;middle-income trap&quot;. As countries move up the economic ladder, they lose their comparative advantage of cheap, labour-intensive manufacture. At the same time, they lack the skill levels and infrastructure to compete with higher-level countries. The Malaysian government&apos;s answer is an economic transformation programme, covering 12 areas ranging from agriculture to tourism, reforms in areas from human capital development to inequality reduction, and a government transformation programme, partly aimed at lowering crime and improving public transport. Hi-tech is a priority in Malaysia&apos;s economic transformation, explains Datuk Ghazali, chief executive of the government&apos;s Multimedia Development Corporation, who was in London this month to meet potential investors. Set up in 1996, the corporation oversees Malaysia&apos;s information, communications and technology (ICT) development initiative. &quot;We can&apos;t compete with China and we don&apos;t want to compete with India on call centres,&quot; said Ghazali. &quot;We are more interested in high-end engineering research and development. DHL, for example, has set up R&amp;D facilities here and in Prague.&quot; ICT constitutes 10.5% of GDP in Malaysia, and the goal is to boost it to 17% by 2020. The focus on technology starts at school. Primary and secondary schools are being equipped with wireless and netbook devices; the government wants a ratio of one device for every five students by next year. In higher education, the government is strengthening ties with international universities, with new overseas campuses being built by Southampton and Nottingham universities. Much of Malaysia&apos;s development strategy depends on attracting foreign investors. But it faces stiff competition from its neighbours. Ghazali, however, compares the neighbourhood to Savile Row, home to some of London&apos;s most prestigious tailors. &quot;The market is big enough for several, serving different clienteles,&quot; he said, pointing out that what seems on the surface to be competition is complementary, with Singapore and Malaysia focusing on different technology niches. Malaysia, he claims, is already building a distinct identity following the arrival and expansion of multinational companies such as Shell, DHL and HSBC. A main attraction for taking a hi-tech route is that the sector \u2013 which created 9,500 jobs last year \u2013 pays well. As Ghazali points out, salaries in technology industries are 90% higher than the average. This offers a chance to retain Malaysians who might otherwise leave for higher-paid jobs in neighbouring countries. In recent years, about 5% of the population has migrated as part of the country&apos;s brain drain. To ensure that growth is inclusive, Malaysia wants to improve the livelihoods of the &quot;bottom 40%&quot;, which take home only 15% of total household income. In 2009, this group had an average household income of 1,440 ringgits (about \u00a3290) a month or less. The government plans to build thousands of kilometres of roads in Sabah and Sarawak \u2013 among Malaysia&apos;s poorest regions \u2013 as well as extend electricity coverage, increase the number of mobile clinics, and build more affordable housing for families with incomes lower than 2,500 ringgits. The vast majority of the bottom 40% are Bumis (ethnic Malays and indigenous groups) and they are the intended beneficiaries of an affirmative action programme called the Bumiputera \u2013 sons of the soil. Under the policy, Bumis get preferential access to economic opportunities including jobs, education, business ownership, real estate, procurement contracts and finance. Some analysts say the policy, introduced after race riots in 1969, made sense at the time and helped reduce inequality, but less so now. &quot;Not only does it undermine prime minister Najib [Razak]&apos;s &quot;1Malaysia&quot; policy \u2013 which emphasises national unity and ethnic harmony \u2013 it also contributes to increased inequality in Malaysia, which is now more severe within ethnic groups (including among Bumis) than between them,&quot; Vikram Nehru, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace thinktank, wrote in a recent blog. &quot;Najib has tried hard to reform the Bumiputera policy, but he has had to compromise in the face of intense pressure from within his own party as well as from powerful ethnic Malay interest groups. The Malay elite have reaped enormous benefits thanks to the policy, and they are unlikely to relinquish their privileges easily.&quot; Analysts say Malaysia&apos;s goal of reaching high-income status is not far-fetched. &quot;Malaysia will definitely reach the target,&quot; says Lawrence S\u00e1ez of the School of Oriental and African Studies, &quot;but it is not likely to move above and beyond its competitors for a long time once it has reached this stage. I wouldn&apos;t sell the Malaysian dream but I would say the targets are credible. Education is the greatest problem facing Malaysia&apos;s development.

The report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) detailed how faulty manufacturing processes had led to one of Rolls-Royce&apos;s Trent 900 engines exploding at 2,100 metres (7,000ft) over Indonesia on a flight from Singapore to Sydney in November 2010. According to the ATSB report, Rolls-Royce knew at least three years before the accident that components manufactured at its Hucknall plant in Nottingham failed to conform to design standards. An initial investigation by the company in 2007 failed to understand the consequences of using parts that did not match the design specification. In 2009, a Rolls-Royce engineer identified the potential risk of these defective parts, but the company failed to carry out an investigation into what this would mean for its fleet of Trent 900 engines. Rolls-Royce missed &quot;a number of opportunities \u2026 generally because of ambiguities within the manufacturer&apos;s procedures and the non-adherence by a number of the manufacturing staff to those procedures&quot;, the ATSB report concluded. The safety agency also highlighted cultural flaws at the Hucknall plant, where it was acceptable not to report so-called minor deviations in parts. This was the first major safety scare for the Airbus A380 jet and resulted in Qantas temporarily grounding its entire fleet \u2013 although Airbus subsequently said the aircraft&apos;s resilience was proven by its ability to land despite severe damage to its left wing. The A380 superjumbo was just minutes into its flight after takeoff from Changi airport Singapore when members of the crew heard two loud bangs. A faulty feed pipe had cracked causing oil to spray into one of the plane&apos;s four engines, which burst into flames. Several passengers saw fuel escaping from the under the affected wing. The pilot, praised for his competence by the ATSB, returned to Singapore and brought the stricken plane down just 150 metres from the end of the runway. None of the 440 passengers and 24 cabin crew were injured, although several homes beneath the flight path were badly damaged when fragments from the engine turbine smashed into walls. Since the accident, Rolls-Royce has introduced software that would shut down a Trent 900 engine to prevent a repeat occurrence. The ATSB, which issued a safety recommendation to Rolls-Royce in December 2010, said it was satisfied with the steps taken regarding Trent 900 engines in A380 planes, adding that quality control at Hucknall had improved. Rolls-Royce said it accepted the conclusions of the ATSB report. &quot;On this occasion we clearly fell short,&quot; said Colin Smith, director of engineering and technology at Rolls-Royce. &quot;We support the ATSB&apos;s conclusions and, as the report notes, have already applied the lessons learned throughout our engineering, manufacturing and quality assurance procedures to prevent this type of accident from happening again.&quot; The engine manufacturer agreed to pay Qantas A$95m (\u00a362m) in a 2011 settlement."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/27/kensington-palace-refit", "sentences": ["Royal travel costs     William and Kate visited the Kranji Memorial Cemetery in Singapore on September 13, 2012.", "Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images    The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge&apos;s colourful Singapore and south Pacific tour set the taxpayer back \u00a3370,590 in travel costs, including the price of a reconnaissance trip by royal staff."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-27T16:30:35Z", "title": "William and Kate's Kensington Palace refit costs \u00a31m", "tags": ["Prince William", "The Duchess of Cambridge", "Monarchy", "UK news"], "article": "The public cost of refurbishing the Kensington Palace apartment that will be the new home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their baby is \u00a31m, the Queen&apos;s accounts reveal.

The huge increase in the number of property millionaires \u2013 with 1,500 new members joining the exclusive housing club every week \u2013 is revealed in a survey released on Friday by the property website Zoopla. It also shows that the number of &quot;million-pound streets&quot; in Britain, where the average property value is more than \u00a31m, has jumped by nearly a quarter over the past year. There are now 8,230 such streets \u2013 including nearly 3,000 in London and another 930 in the capital&apos;s wealthiest satellite towns, such as Kingston upon Thames, Richmond and Harpenden. The number of homes valued at more than \u00a31m has risen to 323,684 \u2013 a 32% increase in the past 12 months. The space taken up by a doormat in Kensington is now worth more than \u00a33,500. Separate figures from Lloyds TSB show that just four sales of million-pound homes took place in Wales during 2012, and nine in the north-east of England. The huge concentration of million-pound houses in London and the south-east will fuel concern about what has been dubbed &quot;the Manhattanisation of London&quot; and the widening north-south divide. In London&apos;s W8 district, which takes in much of Kensington and is home to many celebrities, the average house is now valued at \u00a32.3m. At that price, a standard doormat of 0.24 sq metres (2.58 sq ft) would require a space worth just over \u00a33,500. The comparison with Britain&apos;s poorest streets is stark. In Stoke-on-Trent and Liverpool, the city councils have recently been inundated with applications after launching projects allowing people to buy derelict homes for just \u00a31, while in Ebbw Vale and Tredegar in south Wales, property websites list page after page of homes for sale at under \u00a350,000. Henry Pryor, an independent property expert, said: &quot;What the survey reminds us is that the property market is split in two \u2013 &apos;them and us&apos; as well as north and south, and, far from being &apos;all in it together&apos;, the rich have prospered \u2013 and the rich in London have prospered the most.&quot; He added: &quot;Over 3m people are now on social housing waiting lists, and according to Shelter 14 years is required to save a first-time-buyer deposit. Meanwhile, house prices north of Luton are struggling to float on the choppy waters of the UK housing market. &quot;While the homes of the rich and famous are increasing by more than \u00a3100,000 a year, the majority of the nation&apos;s housing stock is stuck where it was a decade or more ago, and nearly 800,000 of those with a mortgage are in negative equity.&quot; Overseas buyers are behind much of the boom in what upmarket estate agents are now referring to as a new mini city-state, PCL \u2013 prime central London. In 2012, of 7,000 new-build homes sold in prime central London, more than 5,000 went to overseas buyers, and the estate agency Knight Frank said buyers from just two countries, China and Singapore, bought 40% of them. But buyers rarely occupy the properties, leaving parts of prime central London empty of residents and any remaining local shops bereft of customers popping out to buy a paper or pint of milk. The main beneficiary has been the Treasury, which in March last year imposed a 7% stamp duty on home sales above \u00a32m. The new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who has his first day in office on Monday, may find that his \u00a3250,000 housing allowance fails to stretch far in London&apos;s superheated property market. Rents in prime central London have soared alongside house prices, so that Carney&apos;s annual allowance is only enough to cover five weeks&apos; rent for a five-bedroom flat in Knightsbridge currently being marketed by Savills. The huge rise in property prices has left many young families despairing of ever affording a home. On Thursday, data company Experian said owner-occupation levels in some parts of the south-east were falling dramatically, citing Slough, Brent and Bournemouth as some of the &quot;generation rent&quot; hotspots where younger people were struggling to buy a property. In Slough, owner-occupation levels have fallen by 14% over the past decade. The government&apos;s controversial Help to Buy scheme is aimed at helping first-time buyers to afford a property, but critics have warned that it will simply spark another price boom. This month Halifax said average house prices in Britain were rising at their fastest pace for two and a half years.

The coal entrepreneur is now free of potential insolvent trading claims and a possible freeze on his Australian assets. But he\u2019s not out of the woods yet. From his base in Singapore, Tinkler controls a much-diminished empire and remains in debt to his main lender, hedge fund Farallon Capital, which last Wednesday stripped him of his biggest asset, a 19% stake in listed miner WhitehavenCoal. Tinkler shot to fame after he and his partner scraped together $1m to put his foot on the unloved Middlemount coal deposit in Queensland in 2006. Borrowing the rest of the $30m purchase price, Tinkler sold Middlemount on to Macarthur Coal barely a year later, taking shares he quickly traded for a cool $442m in cash. Amazingly, Tinkler pulled off the same trick in 2009, borrowing heavily to buy the Maules Creek deposit in New South Wales from Rio Tinto for $480m and selling it on for $1.2bn in 2010. In one of the greatest spending sprees of all time, Tinkler splurged hundreds of millions of dollars on his horse stud Patinack Farm, the Newcastle Knights rugby league team, the Newcastle Jets football team, private jets and a helicopter, a fleet of exotic supercars and lavish mansions in Newcastle, Brisbane, Coffs Harbour and Hawaii. But Tinkler\u2019s strategy of borrowing to buy, prove up and flip undeveloped coal projects, which worked so well in a booming market, left him over-geared when coal prices slumped last year. Now almost everything he owns \u2013 at least that we know about \u2013 is draining cash, heavily mortgaged and on the market. For critics of the industry, Tinkler&apos;s plight is a parable for Australia, doubling and tripling up on coal. It was always too easy, raking in cash during the China-fuelled commodities boom, and now it\u2019s over. It is also a tale of how Australia celebrates \u2013 then turns upon \u2013 ballsy entrepreneurs like Nathan Tinkler or Alan Bond, who come from nothing and gamble their way to the top. Last week\u2019s disclosures finally confirmed the true extent of Tinkler\u2019s debt to the hedge fund and its clients, including palm oil kings the Kuok family and Martua Sitorus: a one-year, US$634m loan signed last April, after Tinkler pulled off his third big deal, the three-way merger of Whitehaven Coal, Aston Resources and one of his private companies. The loan was mainly secured against Tinkler\u2019s resulting stake in Whitehaven, then worth as much as $1.1bn. But coal markets were softening and as soon as the deal was done Whitehaven shares started falling and never recovered. Under increasing financial pressure, Tinkler tried and failed to reprivatise Whitehaven at a hefty premium to the market. In July the inveterate coal bull also committed to pay $28m for a one-third stake in listed resources company the Blackwood Corporation, majority-owned by Singapore commodities trader the Noble Group \u2013 Tinkler\u2019s early backers in the Middlemount deal. Tinkler created Mulsanne Resources to take up the Blackwood stake but the deadline for payment came and went. After months of stalling and negotiation, Blackwood finally lost patience and liquidated Mulsanne, a $2 shelf company. At first the dispute looked like a mere nuisance for Tinkler, by now battling on many fronts as the tax office moved against a string of his companies, including the prized footy clubs, and receivers claimed his aircraft. Tinkler would gradually settle his tax issues but Mulsanne was turning into a disaster: he faced possible claims of insolvent trading and breach of director\u2019s duties, and in March suffered the indignity of a public grilling in liquidators\u2019 examinations in the NSW supreme court. Meanwhile Whitehaven shares had halved and there was widespread speculation Tinkler was in breach of his loan to Farallon, with accumulated principal and interest of $700m. Tinkler was crunched between his two biggest backers, commodities trader Noble and hedge fund Farallon, both after blood. He put his stud farm up for sale. Tinkler was hoping to get $150m on a walk-in, walk-out basis but there were no bidders at anything like the price he wanted. Agents were appointed to sell his Brisbane mansions. Blackwood rushed to court to freeze Tinkler\u2019s assets. Something had to give. Finally, last Wednesday, it did, when the Farallon-led loan syndicate took control of Tinkler\u2019s Whitehaven shares. Technically a \u201csale\u201d at $2.96 a share, the transaction was more like a lender foreclosing on a borrower in default. Farallon and its clients converted Tinkler\u2019s debts to equity but at the agreed price per share they would only recover a maximum of $565m \u2013 not enough to repay the principal, let alone accumulated, interest. Farallon are hoping Whitehaven will bounce back now the uncertainty over Tinkler&apos;s stake is resolved. By attributing a notional value of $2.96 per share to Tinkler\u2019s stake they are trying to talk the stock up. If Whitehaven&apos;s shares go even higher in the next nine months, Farallon and co have agreed to count the increase against Tinkler&apos;s outstanding loan balance. Whitehaven is generally considered undervalued but the shares rallied just 4% on Tinkler&apos;s exit, to $2.20. It is far from clear whether they will ever recover enough to pay off his loan to Farallon. Worse, there was analyst speculation last year \u2013 denied by Tinkler \u2013 that any \u201csale\u201d of his Whitehaven stake could crystallise a large capital gains tax bill, given the small amount of equity he contributed to buy the asset. By agreeing to the Whitehaven deal, Tinkler appears to have freed up enough cash \u2013 paying $12m to Blackwood on Thursday \u2013 to get them to drop the proceedings against Mulsanne. Where does all this leave him? In the March liquidators\u2019 examinations Tinkler told a packed courtroom his wealth was \u201cnot really\u201d tied to his stake in Whitehaven and that the Tinkler Group Family Trust, controlled by his wife, had assets worth up to $1.4bn. The sky-high asset figure had most observers scratching their heads. All Tinkler\u2019s best-known real estate assets are mortgaged \u2013 to Farallon, Westpac and even US investment bank Jefferies. Tinkler\u2019s unlisted exploration company, Aston Metals, also in debt to Farallon, has rights to the low-grade copper/lead/zinc deposit at Walford Creek, in remote north-west Queensland \u2013 a challenging project which faces opposition from the local Indigenous community. At one stage Tinkler hoped to value the project at $75m but well-placed industry sources are sceptical. Tinkler Group\u2019s development arm, Buildev, has struggled to complete projects and has stranded assets like land on the former BHP steelworks site at Newcastle, where a proposed coal loader \u2013 rejected by the NSW government \u2013 was to be built. Hunter Rail and Hunter Ports \u2013 whose logo is still worn by both the Knights and the Jets, who are without a major sponsor \u2013 are remnants of Tinkler\u2019s grand vision for a vertically-integrated Australian coal company. The Hunter Sports Group, owner of both clubs, is a cash drain. It is a motley collection of assets, all encumbered. Possibly there are less readily identifiable assets associated with Tinkler \u2013 offshore, for example, or belonging to the Tinkler group family trust. What we do know is that Tinkler is restructuring his empire, moving to deregister a string of his private Australian companies and setting up new entities in Singapore. After such a stellar rise, nobody is writing Nathan Tinkler off completely. But from his rented pad in Singapore, it will be an enormous challenge to start again. \u2022 Paddy Manning is writing an unauthorised biography of Nathan Tinkler"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/jun/29/bike-fashion-rise-of-cycle-style", "sentences": ["There are now offices in London, the US, Japan, Australia, Germany and Singapore, and permanent shops (called Cycle Clubs) in London and San Francisco."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-29T16:00:02Z", "title": "Pedalling fashion: the rise of cycle style", "tags": ["Fashion", "Cycling", "Fitness", "Life and style"], "article": "When Simon Mottram, chief executive of the stylish cycling brand Rapha, started the company over a\u00a0decade ago, no one wanted to invest. Between 2001 and 2003, he held over 200 meetings trying to raise enough capital to start the business. &quot;Cycling&apos;s image problem and its lack of cultural relevance in Britain was a huge issue,&quot; says Mottram. &quot;Cycling was completely under the radar. Added to that, we were proposing to start an e-commerce business selling clothes directly to British men \u2013 almost unheard of at the time. It was very, very difficult raising the money.&quot; A decade on, there must be a few money men ruing the decision not to invest. In 2012, Rapha sold \u00a318m worth of clothing, luggage, books and accessories to an affluent and burgeoning clientele of style-conscious cyclists around the world. There have been creative collaborations with the likes of Paul Smith, a keen cyclist himself, and Timothy Everest. In 2010 the company was included in the Sunday Times Fast Track 100 list. There are now offices in London, the US, Japan, Australia, Germany and Singapore, and permanent shops (called Cycle Clubs) in London and San Francisco. Pop-up shops have appeared in New York, Mallorca and Tokyo. In 2012 Rapha became the provider of Team Sky&apos;s clothing. Not every cyclist is a devotee of Rapha, though. In fact, like Marmite, the company splits opinion within the cycling fraternity. There is an amusing spoof website (&quot;Happy is the new misery: suffering was so 2012,&quot; one page announces). Some think the brand is pretentious, and when you&apos;re selling \u00a3300 cycling shoes made with perforated Yak skin uppers, it&apos;s difficult to duck the accusations of exclusivity. Whatever you think of Rapha, the company&apos;s role in putting a cut of dash back into road cycling is undeniable.     Rapha bicycle clothing company founder Simon Mottram. Photograph: Rex Features    &quot;The reason I started the company was that cycling clothes looked horrible,&quot; Mottram says. &quot;In the 90s, most cycling jerseys looked like an explosion in a paint shop. We had a vision to bring new standards of design to cycling clothing. Riding a bicycle is simple. The aesthetic of the clothes we make reflects that.&quot; The success of Rapha has done much to cement one of the more unlikely stories in the annals of British fashion \u2013 the rise of London as the centre of global cycling style. What began with the &quot;heroin-chic&quot; cycle messenger sub-culture in the late 80s has been crowned by the Mamil (Middle-Aged Man in Lycra), often seen wearing full Rapha. It is a wonder how these men \u2013 and I rank among them \u2013 have collectively overcome the traditional male British fear of shopping and turned cycling into a slavishly stylish pursuit. Stopping at a set of traffic lights on a popular cycling route out of London on a sunny Sunday morning can now feel like being in a\u00a0Ralph Lauren fashion shoot \u2013 hulking, panting, bronzed men dressed in several hundred pounds&apos; worth of mainly black apparel with the odd dash of white and a few pink details, ready to be unleashed on the road. I&apos;ve ridden a bicycle most days of my adult life. I ride to get to work, sometimes for work, to keep fit, to bathe in air and sunshine, to go shopping, to travel, to stay sane, to skip bath time with my kids, for fun, for a moment of grace and to hear my boy laugh. In my late 20s, I abandoned my career and pedalled round the world. Throughout most of my lifelong obsession with bicycles, I was never fastidious about what I wore out riding. From the 1970s, when I used to get my bell-bottom jeans wrapped round the chain rings of my Raleigh Hustler, through the garish DayGlo cycling shirts of my teens to the luminous yellow mountain-biking shorts I wore during the 90s, I never aspired to be the model of cycle chic. Cycling itself was deeply unfashionable. I never cared about what I wore &quot;on the Bummel&quot;. That changed when I rode a bike in Italy for the first time a decade ago. Every cyclist I passed in the Dolomites was meticulously turned out in a co-ordinated outfit. What you wear on the bike is such an important part of cycling culture in Italy, there is even an expression to embody it \u2013 bella in sella, which literally means &quot;beautiful in the saddle&quot;. It struck a chord with me that is still resonating. I&apos;ve since become a complete sucker for cycling fashion. By paying attention to what I\u00a0wear when I&apos;m riding, I feel I&apos;m expressing my respect for the bicycle both as a\u00a0machine \u2013 it&apos;s the most efficient form of human-powered transportation yet devised \u2013 and as an object of simple beauty. It is a machine that blurs the line between sport and art. Getting dressed for a long ride, I now earnestly try to synchronise shorts, shirt, rain jacket, gloves, water bottles, shoes, sunglasses and my helmet with the colour scheme of the bike I plan to ride. It is hopelessly vain. To the consternation of my wife, I&apos;ll lay out four outfits before packing my bike bag. Historically, cycling and style have seldom been bedfellows in Britain. During the 20th century, cycling in Britain was heavily cloaked in pragmatism and pastoralism rather than metropolitan chic. The road- racing scene was hugely undeveloped compared with that on the continent, which helps explain why there were so few British cyclists in the Tour de France until recently. The bicycle was for getting to work during the week and for going youth hostelling in britches with a flask of dandelion and burdock at the weekend. The sport of bicycle racing in Britain was strangled by the convention of Victorian rule makers. It largely consisted of time trials, codified in the 1890s by Frederick Thomas Bidlake, a man with a\u00a0peculiar passion for timekeeping. Competitors set off at intervals to ride alone against the clock, up and down a wind-slapped A-road. It&apos;s duller than crown-green bowling. In Europe massed-start racing (the lore of which Rapha plumbs unashamedly and extensively for marketing purposes) was much more popular. Races entailed breakaways and sprint finishes, chases and crashes, suffering and solidarity, tactics and alliances, co-operation and competition, vanity, honour and style. Massed-start road racing is underpinned by the unwritten etiquette of the peloton, something so complex that not even a Victorian Englishman could codify it into a\u00a0booklet of rules. As the French say of cycle racing: Courir c&apos;est mourir un peu \u2013 to race is to die a little.     Rob Penn wears Vulpine. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    Any hint of cycle style in Britain was imported from the continent. After the Second World War, the glittering, lightweight and innovative componentry, the stylish attire and the cyclists with film-star good looks that came out of Italy were like rays of dazzling light in Britain. Even the colours the Italians painted their bicycles \u2013 pearlescent white, yellow, pink, the &quot;heavenly blue&quot; of Bianchi, said to be the colour of the queen of Italy&apos;s eyes \u2013 filled the minds of English yeomen with wonder. Desperate to compete in continental style massed-start road races such as the Tour de France (there were none in Britain at the time), a group of cyclists broke away from the autocratic governing body, the National Cyclists&apos; Union, in the 1950s. The splinter organisation was named the British League of Racing Cyclists, and its rebellious adherents, known as &quot;Leaguers&quot;, distinguished themselves by their modishness, their postwar working-class confidence and their attire. They listened to modern jazz, drank coffee, rode hard and, crucially, looked sharp on the bike. Tim Hilton, in his loving memoir of the mid-20th-century cycling scene, One More Kilometre and We&apos;re in the Showers, wrote: &quot;There was certainly a smart and disobedient look. In the 1950s you could identify a Leaguer by his roadman&apos;s position on the bike, his continental equipment, his preference for derailleur gears, Campag if possible, a\u00a0flashy Italian road jersey and dark glasses.&quot; In some ways the London Mamil is a\u00a0middle-class reincarnation of the long-deceased Leaguer, with a modern twist. For Mottram the recent emergence of the style-conscious British cyclist has coincided with the rise of &quot;metrosexual man&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s a bit of a revolution going on among men,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;re more body conscious, fitter, better toned, able to talk about skincare and more thoughtful about what we wear and how we present ourselves than ever before.&quot;     Rob Penn wears Levi's cycling clothing. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    Nick Hussey, the founder of Vulpine, believes the development of British cycle style is also related to the marriage of high-end performance fabrics with the long tradition of excellence in British tailoring. &quot;The essence of British styling is classical with a twist, using good fabrics and good stitching. It&apos;s about creating beautiful, practical clothes that people feel comfortable in. It was inevitable that those qualities would eventually be applied to cycling clothing.&quot; Vulpine started selling technical, casual cycling apparel in 2012, and is already making waves. James Greig, also a designer, previously worked at Chanel while Jools Walker, in charge of sales, is a well-known cycle-style blogger. The Vulpine range has multiplied to more than 30 products and has established itself as the brand of choice for creative professionals who commute across cities by bike.\u00a0&quot;I knew I\u00a0had to make clothes I completely believed in. They had to be authentic and high quality, in the British tradition,&quot; says Hussey. &quot;It&apos;s also helpful to a young company like us that cycling culture is undeveloped. It would be harder to make a noise in, say, Holland, Belgium or France. There is a blank canvas to write on here, and that is attractive to young designers.&quot; Young companies such as Rapha, Vulpine, Quoc Pham, Ana Nichoola and Velobici may be setting the pace of British cycling style, but several older brands such as Brooks, Carradice and Howies are lending their weight, too. Their success has encouraged retail giants such as Levi&apos;s and H&amp;M to manufacture their own ranges of casual cycling clothes for men \u2013 unthinkable a decade ago. &quot;Success in the Tour de France and the Olympics, more commuters, better infrastructure \u2013 the cycling landscape in Britain is changing fast,&quot; says Hussey. &quot;Importantly, once you start riding a bike, you generally stay riding a\u00a0bike. The market is only going to increase.&quot; Mottram adds: &quot;At Rapha, we feel like we&apos;re just in front of a wave. We&apos;re gradually building a reputation as a cycling nation, and London is now the centre of global cycling culture. It is an extraordinary turnaround in 10 years. There are more bicycle-related concepts and retail ideas being born here than in any other city, and a huge number of flowering, small businesses \u2013 amazing when you think it remains one of the worst cities in the world to ride in.&quot; It&apos;s All About the Bike: the Pursuit of Happiness on Two Wheels by Rob Penn (Penguin, \u00a38.99).

Mitter argues convincingly that the importance of the Sino-Japanese conflict in the second world war is now all too often forgotten. His book will strengthen resistance to the insular tendency to study national histories in isolation from one another. He shows that relations with the wider world were vital to China even when it stood alone against Japan, and that the east Asian conflict shaped both the outcomes of the second world war and the development of the postwar world. The establishment of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949 can be partially attributed to the war which fatally weakened Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s nationalists and allowed the communists to build up both military power and popular support. Understandably, western Europeans consider that the second world war started in 1939 and tend to scoff at Russians, who date it from the Nazi invasion of their country in June 1941, or the Americans for whom it began in December 1941, with the attack on Pearl Harbor. However, as Mitter reminds us, for China the war started even earlier. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s de facto acceptance of the Japanese occupation of north-east China in 1931 allowed some postponement of hostilities. But within a few years Japanese pressure had become too great. Full-scale war broke out in July 1937. By the end of that month Beijing and Tianjin had fallen, and by the end of the year the Japanese had taken both Shanghai and Nanjing, then the national capital. Having lost many of his best troops, Chiang withdrew to west China where he set up a wartime capital in Chongqing. Meanwhile, his former rival in the nationalist party, Wang Jingwei, established a puppet government in Nanjing. The coastal regions and most of the major cities of China were then held by the Japanese until 1945. The communist party controlled small base areas in mountainous north-west China. From 1937 it worked in a rather uneasy alliance with the nationalist party against the Japanese, always maintaining its own independent military power. Mitter&apos;s admirably researched account covers the complexities of China&apos;s domestic politics and international relations from 1937 to 1945. He discusses better-known horrors such as the Nanjing massacre and the terror bombing of Chongqing, but also conveys the vast scale of Chinese suffering \u2013 between 14 million and 20 million Chinese perished in the eight years of war, and 80-100\u00a0million became refugees. China&apos;s small modern sector, including railways, roads and industrial sites, was largely destroyed. There were food shortages and a terrible famine. Nor did this suffering take place only at the hands of the Japanese. Half a million Chinese peasants died in flooding in 1938, caused by Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s attempt to impede the Japanese advance by breaching the Yellow River dykes. Poorly paid and ill-disciplined conscripts in the Chinese army sometimes behaved badly towards the civilian population, as did Chinese puppet troops under Japanese\u00a0direction. But this is also a story of heroic and determined resistance. Factories, universities, schools, newspapers and refugees moved to the interior to build up &quot;Free China&quot; in conditions of extreme austerity. The dismantling of industrial plants in the Shanghai area before the Japanese advance and their evacuation nearly 1,500km up the Yangtze to Chongqing was a triumph of human endeavour. For four years before the US entered the war, with very little international assistance, Chinese armies stood alone against the might of the Japanese empire. Later, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought about the internationalisation of the conflict, Japanese troops defeated colonial armies in Singapore, Malaya, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Yet Chinese resistance did not collapse and the Chinese theatre of war played an important role by tying down large numbers of Japanese troops. In Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Free China and in the areas controlled by the communist party, people had to endure bombing, terrible food shortages and low standards of living, yet they rallied to the national cause. In the occupied areas there was an active underground resistance despite brutal Japanese attempts to suppress it. Mitter&apos;s book is enlivened by extracts from the writing of Chinese people who endured the war and also from many interesting foreigners who reported from wartime China. He uses a wide range of sources with meticulous accuracy. As a New Zealander, however, I have one niggle. James Bertram, one of the first foreigners to interview Mao Zedong, was not an American journalist. Chinese sources describe him as a British correspondent, a confusion that probably arose because New Zealanders at that time travelled on British passports. Bertram was in fact a distinguished New Zealander, born and brought up in Auckland, who ended his career as professor of English in Wellington.

Many of the biggest names in biscuits including Marks &amp; Spencer, Sainsbury&apos;s and United Biscuits \u2013 which makes some of the UK&apos;s most popular biscuits including McVitie&apos;s Digestive and Penguin \u2013 have pledged to reduce the amount of palm oil in their products. The Rainforest Foundation UK (RFUK) and Ethical Consumer magazine together surveyed over 50 of the UK&apos;s biggest biscuit manufacturers about their use of palm oil or its derivatives. The top scoring companies were the Co-op, M&amp;S, Sainsbury&apos;s, Waitrose and United Biscuits. Those at the bottom of the ranking were mostly American-based companies including Asda/Walmart, PepsiCo and Kraft, makers of Ritz and Oreo biscuits. The project was carried out in response to the increasing threat that palm oil production is posing to the world&apos;s rainforest and to the people that rely on these forests for their livelihoods. Palm oil is a core ingredient in many food products but companies are not required by EU law to label products containing it until December 2014. Having destroyed vast areas of forest in countries including Indonesia, which is home to orangutans, the RFUK says palm oil companies are now planning to expand into the rainforests of the Congo basin in Africa, home to lowland gorillas and other threatened primates. Palm oil companies are also partly responsible for the recent devastating forest fires in Sumatra, which caused pollution episodes in Malaysia and Singapore. Simon Counsell, executive director of The Rainforest Foundation, UK said: &quot;UK biscuit manufacturers and retailers are showing that it is possible to outright reduce the use of palm oil, which is going to have to occur globally if large areas of Africa&apos;s rainforests are to be saved from conversion to palm plantations.&quot; Leonie Nimmo, researcher at Ethical Consumer, added: &quot;This survey clearly shows that environmental campaigning is having a positive impact on the palm oil policies of many companies which is something we wholeheartedly support.

As a child I would spend hours listening to Peer Gynt, the William Tell overture and Scheherazade. But only Peter and the Wolf had words. I wanted to know the other stories. The record sleeves gave only perfunctory information, and so I read books and plays, myths and legends, and began to fill in the gaps. And I began to draw. I&apos;ve been drawing or painting to music ever since, although only fairly recently with an orchestra and an audience. Combining storytelling, live art, and music gives children a way into the composers&apos; myriad of notes; it illustrates what the music is about. It leaves them with a picture in their imagination, a story in their memories. When they hear the music again, it will mean something to them, and, as time and distance increase, that will become a deeper, emotional response too. Falling in love with music opens the door to a world of possibilities. This year I&apos;m Guest Director for Family Events at the Cheltenham Music Festival. It&apos;s the third year I&apos;ve been lucky enough to be part of this wonderful festival; Ella Bella Ballerina and a string quartet introduced Tchaikovsky to children in 2011, and last year I joined the Orchestra of the Music Makers from Singapore, painting along to their performance of Rimsky-Korsakov&apos;s Scheherazade. I am incredibly proud to be an ambassador for children&apos;s events at the festival. The strong strand of concerts for young audiences is something festival director Meurig Bowen feels equally passionate about. With the terrifyingly patchy provision of music education in schools \u2013 let alone a focus on the great canon of classical music \u2013 other ways of reaching and inspiring young people have to be found. This year I&apos;ll be joining a pianist from Moscow for a painted performance of Stravinsky&apos;s exquisite piano version of his Firebird ballet. I&apos;ll also be celebrating Britten&apos;s centenary, with a new illustrated-live version of his Young Person&apos;s Guide to the Orchestra, and also by designing his children&apos;s opera, Noye&apos;s Fludde. The latter will be performed in Tewkesbury Abbey, which seems to float upon the landscape like a great ark. Indeed the terrible floods of 2007 stopped at the door, like a Biblical miracle of old. Inside the abbey, carvings and decorations of winged animals and leafy patterns hide. Look up and you will see them, upon the boat-like curve of the ceiling. They have led me to medieval bestiaries and heraldry, a rich source of inspiration. What better venue could there be for the Cheltenham Music Festival to perform this &quot;church opera&quot;? I fell in love with opera in my teens. Here at last was music, story and image all combined. I always dreamed of creating designs for one, although it is very different process to illustrating a book - these are pictures that don&apos;t keep still. A living, breathing tapestry. The process has been a collaborative one. The production is being brought together by many skilled and dedicated people, not least director Edward Derbyshire, who&apos;s encouraged me to work in wholly new and unexpected ways. The challenges of the chosen setting have become an exciting creative journey. Because of the vastness of the Abbey, I have attempted to create height and movement in the design, fluid like water. Principle characters are echoed with giant avatars weaving in and out of the story: the ill-fated gossips are like gaudy gargoyles, while the noble Noah is a Green Man in every sense, the well known image in Tewkesbury Abbey yielding an idea.     Photograph: James Mayhew/Cheltenham festival    The animals come in many forms, some worn by the children, some carried aloft, like medieval church banners, but still two by two (with a few exceptions). Their carriers, in green, are a symbol of optimism and the triumph of nature over man&apos;s selfishness. And the omnipresent face of a powerful God looks down upon all of it. The ark itself has been through many, many designs and plans and dreams. I&apos;ve learned the need to let go of ideas, to not be precious, and the need for compromise. In any case, sometimes it is the simplest ideas that work the best - very much Britten&apos;s ethos with this piece. There is a curious inevitability about my involvement with this particular project. I grew up just outside Britten&apos;s birthplace, Lowestoft, and attended the Benjamin Britten High School. My grandfather&apos;s family had lived next door to him. She sometimes spoke of how, as a child, he wrote music for his sister&apos;s story &quot;Through the Open Window&quot; in which my grandmother played the leading role \u2013 that of a convalescing girl, by a window, who literally watches the world go by in a pageant of colour and song. She liked to say that she was Britten&apos;s first leading lady. She also remembered his curly hair and the fact he would never come out to play, preferring to sit by himself and play the piano. I fear she teased him mercilessly.     Photograph: James Mayhew/Cheltenham festival    In church the hymn I loved the most and sang the loudest was Eternal Father Strong To Save. I liked the words &quot;For those in peril on the sea&quot;. What a thrill it was, upon first hearing Noye&apos;s Fludde, to discover that very hymn woven into the stormy climax of his opera. The sea was an ongoing presence; even in Blundeston, the village where I lived, one could sit in the bright sunshine and hear foghorns. Minutes later a wall of sea-mist would move inexorably towards where you sat, and flood the day with cold damp air. The sea was a big influence on Britten&apos;s music of course; most famously in Peter Grimes, but it&apos;s there in Noye&apos;s Fludde too, composed just a few years after the terrible East Anglian sea-floods of 1953. The music is full of inventive sounds, from tuned tea-cups, to groups of children on recorders. It has a naivety and charm that captures the story as through a child&apos;s eyes, but still has the emotional depth to move and inspire. Not every child will be a musician. But every one can be part of an audience. What a gift to give a child, then, that first step on the road to a lifetime of enjoying great music. * Noye&apos;s Fludde is at Tewkesbury Abbey on 3 and 4 July.

Yet, from the late 1980s onwards, the number of students studying science and maths subjects at A-level dropped, leading to fears that Britain would be unable to compete in these areas internationally. Five years ago, the trend began to reverse and there has\u00a0been a steady increase in student numbers since then. The rise is, in part, attributable to initiatives in science education. These include: the introduction of the Stem Ambassadors programme, in which successful scientists and engineers work directly with schools;\u00a0the opening of the Science Learning Centres; and the introduction of Enthuse awards, which fund continuing professional development (CPD) for science teachers at the National Science Learning Centre (NSLC).  A recent Guardian roundtable brought together experts from the fields of science, education and industry to discuss how the rise in numbers could be maintained. While an earlier roundtable had discussed some of the issues with Stem education, this second roundtable focussed on suggestions for accelerating improvements.  The event, sponsored by Myscience, the organisation that operates the National Science Learning Centre and National Stem Centre, was conducted under the Chatham House rule, by which comments are not attributed to speakers, to encourage open debate. The roundtable began by hearing how more needs to be done to attract high-calibre Stem graduates with the right skills and knowledge into teaching. Science subjects are often taught by non-specialists who may lack the appropriate knowledge in the subject area, which can result in a lack of confidence. Communicating the excitement of science can be a particular problem: one contributor said that including communication skills as an integral part of a science degree or initial teacher training could help to provide excellent Stem graduates with the necessary communication skills to pass on their knowledge in an interesting and inspiring way \u2013 a useful skill, whether or not they go on to become teachers. It was also noted that scholarships for physics students with firsts and upper-seconds to enter teacher training have gone a long way towards addressing the historic issues with recruiting the best graduates into teaching. Professional recognitionA graduate entering teaching today may stay in the profession for more than 40 years. During that time, science will move on considerably, but many science teachers may not have the opportunity to refresh their knowledge of the subject. Some headteachers don&apos;t allow teachers to participate in subject-based CPD, the roundtable heard. One solution put forward at the roundtable was to introduce a planned career structure and programme of professional recognition, with a requirement to keep up with developments in the field. &quot;Doctors and accountants are expected to have CPD, and it is accredited. If you want to be a chartered engineer, you have to keep going back to your CPD to keep up your knowledge of the subject,&quot; one participant suggested.  Teaching also suffers in comparison with other professions by not having a clearly defined career path. A combination of good quality CPD and a clear pathway could encourage top-quality science teachers to stay in the classroom, the roundtable heard.  The relentless drive by government to control what and how teachers teach came in for criticism from many participants, with one pointing out that the minister for health doesn&apos;t\u00a0dictate how operations are performed in hospitals. A greater level of autonomy for teachers would encourage more to stay in the profession and improve the quality of teaching, inspiring more students to\u00a0continue studying the subject at degree\u00a0level. Improving science education is only partly about recruiting the best people into the profession and giving them the opportunity to refresh their knowledge and skills during their career, delegates heard. An equally significant part of the equation relates to what is taught and how it is taught. Science education should meet the needs of all children, said one participant: &quot;One of the challenges is to create a curriculum that provides the citizen of the future with the skills they need, but is also able to stretch the most able and inspire them to study in university.&quot;  This proved hard to achieve in practice. Many participants expressed frustration that the national curriculum in science relies too heavily on making students memorise facts rather than understand scientific principles. While universities were looking for the ability to &quot;join the dots&quot;, students were instead learning &quot;bite-size&quot; chunks of information. The best way to teach science is to inspire curiosity in students, said one participant, but the volume of change was so overwhelming that there wasn&apos;t time to do this.  This prioritisation of facts over understanding is further entrenched, some argued, in the new science national curriculum recently put out for consultation. &quot;There&apos;s a worrying push towards saying, &apos;the curriculum is going to teach this, this\u00a0and this&apos;, and it&apos;s not about problem-solving, it&apos;s about learning a specific thing,&quot; said one. Another participant was critical of the &quot;incoherence&quot; of the proposed changes to the national curriculum, with each stage \u2013 A-levels, GCSEs and key stage 3 (ages 11-14) \u2013 being reformed in turn, instead of as a continuous whole. Frustration among participants at the constant pace of change led to the radical suggestion that education policy should be removed from the control of secretaries of state and put in the hands of a panel of experts from academia, the teaching profession and industry.  There was widespread concern about the unintended impacts of assessment on how science is taught \u2013 for example, the removal of the requirement to sit a science SAT at the end of key stage 2 (7-11) means some primary schools teach the entire science curriculum in a single &quot;science week&quot; rather than throughout the year. One paradox to emerge was a feeling that, in the past 30 years, increased scrutiny of the profession had improved the quality of teaching, while some of the skills of school-leavers seemed to have declined, particularly compared to those in countries such as Singapore and Germany. Some argued that competition for business among the examination boards had led to simplified approaches to assessment and the curriculum. &quot;Assessment is a particular bugbear. If you teach just to get through the assessment, then it doesn&apos;t teach knowledge or apply that knowledge, it just teaches people to answer facts,&quot; said one. Many participants agreed that the model of a single examination board, which works well in Scotland, would be a significant improvement. Often the quality of advice in schools about careers in science is poor, participants suggested. Girls, for example, are still discouraged in many schools from taking physics: while the proportion of girls studying other Stem subjects had increased, few girls study physics beyond 16, the debate was told. An Institute of Physics intervention, the Stimulating Physics Network \u2013 which focused on improving intellectual engagement and helping teachers to consider gender issues in their teaching \u2013 had resulted in doubling the participation of girls in those schools compared to the national average.  Yet students are still not being told about the wide range of science careers available and are often given the impression that there are only a handful of options available for physics and chemistry graduates. &quot;Most of the people giving advice and guidance to young people, especially at key stage 3, are not experts \u2013 they have no idea how a\u00a0particular science career might develop,&quot; said one contributor. One participant spoke of a student, who wanted to study chemistry at university, being discouraged from taking A-level physics because the school feared a poor result would adversely affect its league-table standing. When the student came to apply for a university place to study chemistry, he found that most insisted on an A-level in physics.  Enabling teachers to experience other careers would put them in a better position to advise others, another participant argued: &quot;How can you expect teachers to offer advice when they&apos;ve come straight through the education system and not done very much else? Shouldn&apos;t we have part-time models where teachers come in and do one thing part of the time and another thing the rest of the time?&quot; Although good practice exists, the consensus was that, too often, policymakers have failed to understand the true purpose of science education as a way of equipping students with vital skills. As one contributor put it: &quot;We need to confirm that the purpose of science education is for understanding science so you can apply your knowledge, so that science is something you do, not something you remember.&quot; Roundtable report commissioned by Seven Plus and controlled by the Guardian.

Both emphasised the extent to which, despite the airless cocoon in which international sporting bodies operate, the world beyond has changed since Lord Coe&apos;s bold pitch won the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005. Only Istanbul&apos;s case for the 2020 Olympic Games, from a bid on the back foot as a result of the violent protests and police brutality beamed around the world from Taksim Square over recent months, vowed to &quot;step beyond sport to make history&quot;. As the choreographed dance to the IOC&apos;s tune enters its final phase, three very different bids are jockeying for position. The lobbyists are out in force, drawn like bees to honey. It has become a bidding cliche, but the veteran IOC member Dick Pound said it was genuinely the closest race he could remember \u2013 partly because all the bids had obvious strengths and weaknesses \u2013 and still very much a three-horse race. Until six weeks ago, Istanbul&apos;s bold pitch to unite east and west and invest in an eye-catching Games that would bring the world to the banks of the Bosphorus was considered a narrow favourite. Events in Taksim Square, not to mention a technical report by an inspection team led by the British IOC member Sir Craig Reedie that highlighted the extent of the logistical challenges, have potentially changed all that. They were glad of the chance to look members in the eye and try to claw back some ground. &quot;Today we went a long way to giving the IOC members the reassurance that they sought,&quot; said one bid insider. Madrid, meanwhile, was rarely mentioned in dispatches in the early stages of the race, with the assumption being that its tattered economy would count against it. But there is historically a lot of goodwill for its bid in IOC circles and Madrid has worked hard to turn a negative into a positive by stressing that most of its venues are built already and its ability to deliver a low-cost, compact vision. Many are now speculating that it will make it through the first round of voting and, if it does, all bets will be off. Madrid&apos;s team were generally agreed to have given the most impressive presentation, with the contribution of the former Olympic sailor crown prince Felipe \u2013 who carried the flag for Spain at the Barcelona Games \u2013 garnering particular praise. As for the safe pair of hands promised by Tokyo, considered the narrow favourite ahead of this round of presentations at the home of the Olympic movement, its biggest challenge is to guard against the impression that its bid lacks a compelling back-story and is, to put it bluntly, a bit dull. To counter that notion they engaged the broadcaster Christel Takigawa as a &quot;cool ambassador&quot;, made an effort to speak in French and English and have promised to inject their final presentation in September with some stardust. The lobbies of Lausanne&apos;s finer hotels hum to the polite, sometimes inane, chatter that characterises this final phase of a long race. IOC members talk in riddles and refuse to show their hands, while the race to succeed Jacques Rogge as the next president (all six candidates will present their cases to the membership on Thursday) could also be a factor. A new introduction to the process four years ago, this final chance to present to the majority of the IOC membership (18 excused themselves, including Sepp Blatter and Princess Anne) behind closed doors is seen as crucial. This was the first and last opportunity for the bidders to engage the entire electorate before the final vote in Buenos Aires on 7 September. It was at this stage in 2009 that Rio seized the initiative from Chicago with its bid to bring the Games to South America for the first time, gaining a momentum that saw them over the line in Copenhagen two months later despite the late intervention of a then newly elected President Obama. The fact the next Games are in Rio, recently targeted by its own protesters and a logistical challenge to deliver, could also play in favour of the &quot;safety-first candidates&quot;. But by the same token it is impossible to underestimate the extent to which IOC members like to feel as though they are breaking new ground and making history, even in troubled economic times. They also like to feel themselves to be above the short-term vicissitudes of today&apos;s news bulletins. &quot;We all live in a Chicken Little age where the sky is always falling in. It&apos;s seven years away and they will deal with the situation,&quot; insisted Pound. A relaxed looking Coe \u2013 in town to front Glasgow&apos;s own bid for the 2018 Youth Olympic Games \u2013 could afford to smile at the sight of the harassed, dog-tired bid executives in their matching suits as he recalled the final weeks of London&apos;s bid in 2005. &quot;I saw them a couple of weeks ago and they look a lot more tired than [we did] then,&quot; said Coe. &quot;The real challenge is just to keep going now, to keep focused and to keep believing and not listening to the gossip. I feel their pain. &quot;It&apos;s not an exact science and never has been.

Darrel Webber is remarkably upbeat given the circumstances. As secretary general of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, he presides over the world&apos;s flagship certification body for the palm oil industry. Many blame the fires \u2013 five of which are reportedly burning on roundtable-certified plantations \u2013 on slash-and-burn approaches to forest clearance. That gives Webber some explaining to do. The energetic former environmentalist is quick to defend his member companies. Citing research from the World Resource Institute, he claims that about half (47%) of the fires are raging outside timber and palm oil plantations. The roundtable has given the palm oil companies embroiled in the controversy 48 hours to respond with detailed maps of the affected areas. &quot;If the fires are outside (the companies&apos; plantations), then great; if they are inside, then we have to understand why it is happening.&quot; If those firms turn out to be negligent, then they could face expulsion from the high-profile certification group, he warns. Slow pace of change This is tough talk. Set up nearly 10 years ago, the rondtable has become the poster boy for the multi-stakeholder approach to sustainability. Around the table sit environmental NGOs, social organisations and banks, as well as the various businesses involved in the palm oil trade: growers, processors, traders and retailers. It now counts just shy of 1,300 members, far outstripping similar roundtables on commodities such as soya, sugar, cotton, seafood and beef. The downside of the multi-stakeholder model is the pace of change. Having to pass everything via consensus generally means setting the bar low to keep everyone on board. Webber says this inclusive response meets companies where they are at and pushes them towards &quot;continuous improvement&quot;. Companies that gain certification for part of their operations, for example, must achieve compliance across the board within three years. That said, only two companies have been thrown out of the roundtable to date for non-compliance. Even Webber can accept that things are moving slowly. Deforestation and other environmental damage caused by palm oil continues \u2013 although he&apos;d argue that it&apos;s not primarily being driven byroundtable members. As well as the heartlands of Malaysia and Indonesia, new areas of tropical Africa and Latin America are opening up to the cash crop. Uptake by consumers of certified palm oil is more sluggish than Webber would like, too. &quot;Sustainable palm oil is still not a commodity; it&apos;s a niche. We only have 15% of the [total palm oil] market&quot;, he admits. To make matters worse, nearly half (48.3%) of the 8.59m tonnes of certified palm oil produced over the last 12 months has failed to find a buyer. Instead, it was sold as conventional palm oil without a price premium. That hardly inspires producers to certify. Laggard buyers Amid this lacklustre picture, a few bright spots stand out. Countries such as The Netherlands, Belgium and the UK have all pledged to import 100% certified palm oil by 2015. Consumption rates in these countries run at around 30%-40%. The European Union is set to introduce compulsory labelling for all products that contain palm oil in late 2014, as well. Webber hopes this will raise consumer awareness of the issues related to palm oil production and increase pressure on the industry to certify. While he accepts there is &quot;headroom&quot; for growth in Europe, his chief concern is winning uptake in huge consumer markets, such as the US, India and China. Certified palm oil has yet to make a dent on non-European consumers \u2013 something Webber hopes that would turn around were Europe to act as a &quot;guiding light for other regions&quot;. He blames global buyers for being lukewarm towards certification. Unlike consumers, the world&apos;s big purchasers of palm oil \u2013 food manufacturers, personal care brands, pharmaceuticals and so on \u2013 have full visibility of the supply chain. &quot;Companies have that power of analysis. They also have the scale to bring it [certified palm oil] to the market. I think it&apos;s those companies that need to work much harder&quot;, he states. Difficulties in accessing available supply shouldn&apos;t detract them, he insists. When roundtable growers cannot sell their produce on the premium market, they can issue virtual credits instead. Consumer goods companies and brands can then buy these so-called Green Palm certificates as a means of offsetting their purchase of non-sustainable palm oil. It&apos;s not perfect, but it&apos;s a step in the right direction, he says. &quot;There is nothing to stop companies offsetting their [unsustainable] purchases today with certificates. You can get certificates tomorrow if you want \u2026 Once the level [of certified supply] is high, then it&apos;ll be easy for you to get the physical supply. You can just pick up the phone,&quot; Webber explains. Consumer pressure As the market for sustainable palm oil struggles to find its feet, environmentalists and consumer groups are growing understandably frustrated. Webber is not deaf to the calls in some quarters to abandon the use of palm oil altogether, especially in foodstuffs and biofuel. That would be the &quot;worst thing&quot; consumers could do, he argues. Why? Because palms require much less land to produce the same volume of oil as the best agricultural alternatives. Soya is about 10 times less productive per unit of cultivation, for instance, while rapeseed is around five times less. &quot;Saying no to palm oil means somewhere else you are going to have to produce one tonne more of another vegetable oil \u2026 So if you&apos;re saving one hectare of rainforest today from palm oil, you&apos;re removing four hectares of the Cerrado from Brazil tomorrow&quot;, he states. Put that way, there doesn&apos;t seem to be much choice. Opt out of palm oil, and we&apos;ll either lose some of our favourite products or see yet more land given over to vegetable oil production. Stick with it, and we have to watch as sustainable certification schemes limp along. Governments can certainly help to speed things up. In Indonesia, for example, lawmakers recently obliged all palm oil producers to meet a watered down version of the roundtable certification criteria. The fires there suggest such an approach has its limitations. Webber is the first to admit the fickleness of lawmakers. &quot;The only thing that is stopping further deforestation is legislation,&quot; he notes, in reference to measures such as moratoriums on felling and restrictions on new plantations. &quot;And legislation can change.&quot; The big push that the roundtable needs must ultimately come from consumers. A clear message from the tills will force buyers to act and thus oblige traders and producers to respond. But what will make consumers sit up and start shouting? Strange as it may sound, an immediate answer might just be lurking in the smog outside Webber&apos;s office window in downtown Kuala Lumpur. &quot;If you dig deeper, you&apos;ll find that RSPO plantations do come out much better,&quot; he maintains, referring to the supposed eradication of slash-and-burn techniques and better fire-risk management. The results of RSPO&apos;s internal investigation will be out &quot;within a fortnight&quot;. If Webber&apos;s claims prove right, it could well bolster his case for consumers to start demanding more certified palm oil. If he&apos;s wrong, well, we may need to find an alternative to the roundtable or to palm oil production, or both \u2013 and fast. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Medell\u00edn, the Colombian city that was once considered one of the most dangerous in the world when it was in the grip of Pablo Escobar&apos;s drug cartel but has been transformed in recent years, also lost out, even though the country&apos;s president flew in to front its presentation. Despite a presentation that included an impressive address from 15-year-old Elizabeth Pollard, who was in tears afterwards, and a closing speech from Coe, the general consensus was that Glasgow&apos;s bid was too close to the London Games and that the UK has had its share of major sporting events. &quot;We presented well, but it seems to be that it was too soon after London,&quot; said Sir Craig Reedie, the British International Olympic Committee executive board member who had hoped to bring the fledgling event to his home town. &quot;We tackled that head on and dealt with it but it seems we couldn&apos;t get over it.&quot; Hoy, winner of six Olympic gold medals and a bid ambassador, said: &quot;It was a fantastic presentation. You can never tell. The reason everyone was nervous going in is that you don&apos;t know how the vote is going to go or what they&apos;re going to make of the presentation.&quot; Glasgow was eliminated in the first round of voting with just 13 votes of the 85 cast. In the final round of voting Buenos Aires prevailed by 49 votes to 39, leaving the Medell\u00edn delegation devastated. Medell\u00edn had delivered the most passionate presentation, with President Santos urging the IOC to take the event, which features 3,600 athletes between 14 and 18 and is supposed to help the Olympic movement capture the attention of a new generation, to Colombia. &quot;Colombia is now a new Colombia,&quot; he said. &quot;A nation that dreams and smiles, a nation that likes to think big. I humbly ask you to give us this chance and we will not let you down.&quot; But the IOC members plumped instead for the Argentinian capital, where they will gather in September to elect a new president and decide on the hosts of the 2020 Olympics. The Kuwaiti IOC member, Sheikh Ahmad al-Sabah, is thought to have played a key role in lobbying delegates to vote for Buenos Aires. The sheikh, president of the Association of National Olympic Committees, is increasingly seen as a key power broker in world sport having helped Salman al-Khalifa secure the presidency of the Asian Football Confederation and Marius Vizer to the SportAccord leadership. Buenos Aires ranked third in the evaluation report prepared for the IOC members and was generally considered to have given the least compelling presentation. But Glasgow&apos;s proximity to London 2012 and the relative uncertainty of taking the event to Medell\u00edn appeared to work in its favour. The sports minister, Hugh Robertson, said that the Glasgow bid, which had cost the Scottish government and Glasgow city council \u00a31m each, was &quot;a step too far&quot; given the UK&apos;s recent success in winning major events. &quot;I thought we put together a very good bid,&quot; said Robertson. &quot;A number of IOC members said we delivered the best presentation but that it was too close to London. I don&apos;t think it was wrong to be ambitious about it but the reality is that we&apos;ve just had a fantastically successful Olympics and Paralympics and this was one step too far.&quot; Coe, the chairman of the British Olympic Association, said: &quot;I feel sorriest for the people of Glasgow \u2013 it was a very strong bid with good feedback \u2013 and for Craig Reedie. Craig had lived with this for two years and it was his baby and he&apos;s a Glaswegian. He will feel as disappointed as anybody. &quot;The guys in Glasgow put the proposition together and it was a really sensible approach. But timing is everything and there is no doubt there were a few members who are clearly thinking about the proximity of London.&quot; The Youth Olympic Games are a pet project of the outgoing IOC president, Jacques Rogge, who will be succeeded by one of six candidates at the IOC session in Buenos Aires in September. The YOG first took place in Singapore in 2010 and will next be held in Nanjing, China, in 2014."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/jul/08/australia-economy-glenn-stevens-five", "sentences": ["Stevens also noted that other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malaysia which have done OK in recent years have experienced a similar drop."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-08T04:29:00Z", "title": "Australia's economy: five pointers from Glenn Stevens", "tags": ["Business", "Australia news"], "article": "The Reserve Bank governor, Glenn Stevens, gave a speech in Brisbane last week to the Economic Society of Australia. Here\u2019s what you need to know. 1. Glenn Stevens needs to work on his stand-up routine Here\u2019s a central banker joke: A Reserve Bank governor walks into a business luncheon and says: \u201cAs you may know, the Reserve Bank board in fact held its meeting here in Brisbane yesterday at which we deliberated for a very long time and then elected to sit with the cash rate unchanged.\u201d OK. Maybe you needed to be there. The punchline is \u201cwe deliberated for a very long time\u201d. That line isn\u2019t in the draft of the speech provided on the RBA\u2019s website. Stevens just indulged in a bit of deadpan humour \u2013 the joke being that they deliberated for a long time to do nothing. The problem is those who trade foreign exchange see more meaning in every single utterance of central bankers than Dan Brown does in a Renaissance painting. And so, after he said this, the Australian dollar dropped half a cent in the space of a couple minutes, all because traders thought this made it more likely the RBA will cut rates next month. Despite deputy governor Philip Lowe confirming the day after that it was indeed a &quot;light-hearted remark&quot;, the dollar has stayed down. This is actually something Stevens wants to happen, so perhaps the joke is on those who think he was joking. 2. It really is time to realise the world\u2019s economy has changed since the GFC Call this the latest episode of comedian Glenn Stevens\u2019s ongoing sitcom, Only Fools and Horses ... Still Think the Pre-GFC Period Was Normal (yes the title needs work). Stevens noted that Australia\u2019s average growth before the GFC was 3.5%. But then the world did an economic impersonation of Del Boy falling through the bar. Since then growth has averaged about 2.5%. Stevens also noted that other countries such as Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand and Malaysia which have done OK in recent years have experienced a similar drop. He concluded that &quot;Australia seems to be part of a broader pattern here\u201d. A pretty obvious pattern at that \u2013 high growth prior to the GFC, lower growth since.     Average annual GDP growth Photograph: /IMF world economic outlook report    So the next time someone says that comparing Australia\u2019s economy now with 2007 is a good way to judge which party is better at running the economy, suggest to them they leave the comedy to the professionals \u2013 the entire world was doing better in 2007. 3. Getting through the GFC required more luck than having a lot of mining Stevens noted that we were lucky to have mining to help us through the GFC, but we were also lucky it hit when it did. In 2007, Australia\u2019s level of sub-prime mortgages (high-risk loans made to people with few assets and poor credit history) was low but rising fast. So when the sub-prime collapse happened in America in 2008 it meant that the issue here was still just \u201ca small problem ... [that] stayed small\u201d. Had it occurred a year or so later, Australia\u2019s finance sector would have been much more vulnerable. He also noted that it was lucky we had changed our behaviour when we did. Our switch to \u201cslower borrowing, more saving\u201d actually occurred prior to the GFC. By the end of 2006 we had already decided enough mad spending was enough.     Household saving ratio Photograph: ABS    That switch helped us when the GFC hit, and has also helped keep inflation down during the last few years of the mining investment boom. So well done Australia, we made our own luck. 4. Stevens wants us to build houses The switch to saving means in Stevens\u2019s view that \u201chouseholds have accumulated a good deal of cash\u201d. He would like to see it spent on building houses, saying: \u201cIf anything, we will need to build more dwellings than we have been over recent years.\u201d But while in the Q&amp;A session afterwards he noted higher house prices was a driver of housing construction, he thought it would be a bad result if lower interest rates just led to \u201chigher prices and not more houses\u201d.     Monthly construction of private sector homes Photograph: /ABS    Private housing construction has increased a bit of late, and given the RBA last year also noted the importance of supply-side issues with housing such as land release, zoning, and housing design approvals, I\u2019m not sure Stevens is too interested in lowering interest rates further just to keep fuelling demand. 5. The future is unknown (but don\u2019t worry) In the past 21 years since our last recession, Australia\u2019s GDP has grown by around 100%. If back in 1991 you had said only 3% of that growth would be due to manufacturing, a smart response would have been to ask: \u201cWhere is the growth coming from?\u201d Stevens posed this same question last week and answered that \u201cmost of the time the answer ... is that only part of it will come from the old traditional areas, and a fair bit of it will come from new things, often things of which we are only dimly aware\u201d. This sounds unnerving \u2013 and it is \u2013 but Stevens suggests we\u2019re as well placed to achieve this transition to a different economy as ever before. In the past 50 years whenever our exports boomed, high inflation followed; this time it didn\u2019t. Twenty years ago when our economy changed, it came off the back off a deep recession; this time it hasn\u2019t. That doesn\u2019t mean though that the change will be \u201csimple and easy\u201d. He noted that both sides need to continue their current aim for a surplus in the near term, and businesses need to continue to improve productivity \u201cat the enterprise level\u201d. He also referred to the Productivity Commission\u2019s \u201cto-do list\u201d which contains some politically tough measures (for example, dropping support for failing industries such as the automotive sector and tightening requirements for drought support). Stevens stressed the need for confidence and said that at present it is a bit \u201csubdued\u201d. But he concluded, albeit in his usual understated way, with an upbeat message. Our current solid economic position, together with prudent policies, should mean Australians \u201creasons for confidence about the future\u201d. And that is no joke."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/sichem-hawk-asylum-seeker-timeline", "sentences": ["Tuesday 2 July 7.17am: Maltese-flagged oil and chemical tanker Sichem Hawk, heading north en route to Singapore, gives assistance.", "Thursday 4 July Asylum seekers arrive at Christmas Island and Sichem Hawk sails for Singapore.Monday 8 July Immigration department says it cannot verify the country of origin of the asylum seekers because they are still undergoing &quot;initial interviews&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-08T05:39:00Z", "title": "Sichem Hawk steams into a fresh crisis - timeline", "tags": ["Australian immigration and asylum", "Australia news", "World news", "Refugees"], "article": "Monday 1 July 8.37pm: Australian Maritime Safety Authority gets first request for assistance from asylum vessel in international waters between Java and Christmas Island. 10.31pm: Indonesia&apos;s search and rescue agency Basarnas accepts responsibility for co-ordinating response.

Former Standard Chartered boss Mervyn Davies was said to be heading up one consortium, while Singapore fund Temasek was also reported to have expressed preliminary interest. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:  Please form an orderly queue. The weekend media carried a number of articles which suggested that an initial part sale of the government&apos;s 39% stake in Lloyds (worth around \u00a318bn at the current share price) could come as soon as August of this year. It was also indicated that a sale to such investors would not just need to exceed the price at which the shares are held in the government&apos;s accounts (understood to be 61p per share), but would also need to be carried out at a premium to the prevailing share price, albeit perhaps still below the original government in-price (just under 74p per share) in order to satisfy value for money rules.  A sale to a small number of investors at a premium to the prevailing share price could help overcome investor concerns around value dilution for existing share holders and suggestions that it may be better to wait to pick up the shares cheaper in the placing. It could also leave bench-marked funds that currently have an underweight position even more exposed to a further rise in the share price, in our view.  The fact that such heavyweight investors are queueing up for a piece of the action, suggests to us that they remain confident of future capital appreciation and income generation from the shares.  It is possible that an announcement of a sale could coincide with the release of the company&apos;s interim results on 1 August, which we think will include an upbeat outlook statement given the banks recently strengthened capital position and the apparently improving outlook for the UK economy, housing market and consumer (as judged by recent surveys and data releases), to which the company&apos;s financial prospects are closely tied.  The reports also helped the other state-owned bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, which has risen 8.1p to 284.8p. Meanwhile HSBC is 7.8p higher at 720.1p after Friday&apos;s news it was exiting its South Korean business. Shore Capital again:  While the withdrawal from such a large and important Asian economy may raise some eyebrows, we note that HSBC had already indicated that South Korea is not on its list of priority growth markets. This planned exit does not...have any impact on our investment opinion, which remains a positive one given the ongoing self help story that is being rolled out in the company and the attractive valuation, notably a 2014 dividend yield of 5.2%.  Talk of the UK government accepting the Tyrie report on banking reforms has done little for the sector. Overall the FTSE 100 is up 65.14 points at 6440.66, as Greece reaches a deal with its Troika lenders and the Eurogroup gathers for its latest meeting. Defensive stocks, in demand on a risk-free day, are heading lower as investors regain their nerve.

Among the other risers, Arm added 19p to 860p after a buy note from Jefferies, which was optimistic about the chip designer&apos;s prospects in the server market. Arm has lost a chunk of its value in recent weeks on two main concerns: firstly that it would lose market share in its key smartphone and tablet market; and secondly, its move into the server market to take on Intel was unlikely to make up the difference. Elsewhere ITV rose 3.3p to 152.8p following reports it might bid up to \u00a390m for Scandinavian production business Nice Entertainment, which makes dramas and reality shows.

Among the mid-caps, Hikma Pharmaceuticals jumped nearly 6% after lifting its full year revenue forecast for the second time in just a couple of months.

Its shares added 56p to \u00a310.50, helped by vague talk of possible merger activity in the sector. More evidence of a revival in the UK housing market - boosted by government schemes - has come from Bovis Homes. After positive updates from the likes of Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey last week, Bovis said it had seen a 40% increase in net reservations in the first six months of the year. Its sales growth accelerated in the second quarter after the launch of the government&apos;s Help to Buy scheme. Bovis shares climbed 55p to 830p while other builders also continue to rise, with Taylor Wimpey up 3.5p at 106.3p and Persimmon 11p better at \u00a312.67. But Betfair fell 39.5p to 840p.

Parveen doesn&apos;t like to talk much. She might not do the interview at all. And yet, 19 minutes of conversation later, it&apos;s obvious that the greatest female Sufi singer in history is almost disappointingly blissed out. &quot;My culture \u2013 our culture \u2013 is rich in spirituality and love,&quot; she says, in a densely poetic Urdu. &quot;Sufism is not a switch, the music isn&apos;t a show \u2013 it&apos;s all of life, it is religion. If I want to be recognised for anything, if we should be recognised for anything, it&apos;s the journey of the voice. And that voice is God&apos;s.&quot; Smoothing herself elegantly on to the sofa of a hotel suite in Manchester, Parveen gives a beatific smile. It would be eerie if it wasn&apos;t so soothing; anyone who has watched her on stage knows that this magnificent projection of calm often ends up a wild, sweaty, ecstatic mess. She has admitted to hallucinating while deep in performance and she regularly sends her audiences in Pakistan and India into swaying raptures, swooning and fainting being quite standard reactions. Her first US tour was in 1993 and she has since travelled across the world to perform at sold-out venues. Bj\u00f6rk counts Parveen as one of her greatest musical influences; composer John Tavener \u2013 who she performed with last Sunday night at Manchester international festival \u2013 said he had a gut-wobbling, primordial experience watching her in rehearsals for their one-off show together. Her own concert last Saturday, where she sang classic qawwalis, ghazals and kafis \u2013 all variations on Pakistani folk and classical \u2013 was met with yelps and dancing in the aisles of Bridgewater Hall. She credits her father (and God, naturally) for the success. &quot;I was very attached to my father. Classical Sufi music, for him, came from the soul \u2013 I was pulled in by it. We spent hours at the dargahs [Sufi shrines, often built over the graves of saints], singing and reciting at festivals. It was normal in the culture I grew up in.&quot; Parveen, now 59, says she was three years old when she first sang. She was born into a long line of Sufi mystics and singers; her father, Ghulam Haider, founded a devotional music school in Larkana, the Sindhi city in which she was born and, famously, where the Bhutto political dynasty \u2013 and its Pakistan People&apos;s party \u2013 was established. Parveen&apos;s talent, decided Haider, outweighed tradition. He trained her throughout childhood, rather than his two sons, to pursue music \u2013 &quot;because it was my calling&quot;. She laughs when I ask her about the sexism she might have faced earlier in her Sufi singing career, in such a male-dominated environment: &quot;The concept of being a man or a woman doesn&apos;t cross my mind. I&apos;m neither on stage, I&apos;m a vehicle on stage for passion.&quot; She is dressed androgynously today as she always is: beige, buttoned-up collar kameez (long tunic) and shalwar (trousers), with a traditional Sindhi print shawl draped over her chest. &quot;I&apos;ve never felt the need to challenge anyone else \u2013 I should be concentrating my energies on challenging myself.&quot; To an extent it&apos;s true: Parveen&apos;s talent transcends any gender expectations back home; she is adored, just as much as her peers Mehdi Hassan and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan have been. Parveen&apos;s late husband, Sheikh Ghulam Hussain, retired from his job as a producer on Radio Pakistan to mentor and manage her career in the 80s. After he died of a heart attack on an international flight in the early 00s, her daughter Maryam took up the role. There is a sense that Parveen&apos;s career has taken a more commercial route as a result. She has performed on Coke Studio, Pakistan&apos;s biggest music show, sponsored by the cola company. She joined the judging panel, with Asha Bhosle, of the hugely popular TV talent show Sur Kshetra, which was filmed in Dubai and pitted Indian and Pakistani performers against one another. She even licensed her spiritual ghazals to Bollywood, since her &quot;spiritual brother&quot;, Khan, recorded songs for Bollywood films in the 90s. It&apos;s a long way since Parveen&apos;s early days, when she would reportedly leave jewellery dropped at her feet on stage, as she didn&apos;t want to be remembered for how much she had, rather than what she did. After all, business and Sufism, arguably the purest devotional form of Islam, can hardly make for natural bedfellows? &quot;The business side. Yes, that has to be for others because this journey, money doesn&apos;t come into it. I don&apos;t let it enter my mind because it&apos;s a pollutant. They tell me to do a show, I do it. Record a CD, I do it. I want this to be peace and love, I go to India so much because of this reason \u2013 we used to be one country. I go to Mauritius, Singapore, America, it&apos;s my job \u2013 I am an ambassador for the heart and will of our Pakistan. This is my destiny.&quot; Unsurprisingly, Parveen laughs and declines to comment on who she voted for in recent elections. She declines to comment, too, on whether Sufism and its music is being used by successive Pakistani governments as a political tool to improve the country&apos;s image abroad, rather than there being a genuine state-level interest in preserving and supporting this part of the nation&apos;s heritage. After all, the Pakistani Taliban are still bombing and violently attacking Sufi sites and shrines, which are left unprotected and ignored by political leaders. Isn&apos;t there a disconnect? &quot;Pakistan seems disconnected from the outside. But it is built and running on prayers of our Sufi kings, our pirs. Poor people, rich people \u2013 we are all God&apos;s servants \u2026 I&apos;m lucky. My audience is my God.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jul/08/curriculum-hype-teaching-matters-most", "sentences": ["We will at last be able to look Hong Kong, Massachusetts, Singapore and Finland in the eye with overdue self-respect, we were told by the prime minister and his exuberant education secretary, Michael Gove."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-08T19:34:18Z", "title": "Don't believe the curriculum hype \u2013 teaching matters most", "tags": ["Curriculums", "Teaching", "Secondary schools", "Schools", "Education", "Education policy", "Politics", "Michael Gove", "UK news"], "article": "On Monday, amid a veritable hailstorm of cliches about rigour and aspiration, we were promised a bold new beginning \u2013 a national curriculum ready to &quot;match the world&apos;s best&quot;.

They will recite times tables to a level barely conceived of and then tug a forelock of dutiful thanks.

That saddens me because I believe strongly in the principles of a national curriculum \u2013 that is, a curriculum that is actually and non-negotiably national, just as Lord Baker intended in 1988. Thus a child might move from one school to another and, irrespective of background or the whims of their teacher, be taught &quot;the best that has been thought and said&quot;. It&apos;s what I thought Michael Gove was promising. Politicians delude themselves about how much the curriculum matters and believe it is their right to define what children should be taught, rubbishing an earlier curriculum as too soft or lacking in rigour. What matters most is teaching. Boyle&apos;s law, after all, is Boyle&apos;s law. In the hands of teacher A it might be a topic of breathtaking wonder while with the duffer in the classroom next door life drains away in boredom. The fast-paced reform of a zealous education secretary may actually slow down the real work most of us are doing in our schools to make teaching better.

But after the discovery that some of the assertions he made to justify his &quot;knowledge-based&quot; core curriculum had only the flimsiest of evidence, the need for a radical overhaul is more questionable than ever. The timetable for introduction at the start of the 2014 school year remains eye-wateringly tight, resources are scarce and major exam reforms will not all be ready. Teachers are still anxious about how prescriptive the curriculum remains. And at the heart of the debate is the unresolved question of whether facts or method take priority. Like many politicians, Mr Gove prefers the disaster narrative. He sees results from England&apos;s 15-year-olds sliding down international performance tables. If that were certain, it might justify radical reform. It isn&apos;t. According to a study done by the educational publishers Pearson in January, which correlated the OECD &quot;Pisa&quot; student attainment statistics with other measures of success such as adult literacy and graduation levels, Britain (as a whole) was ranked sixth, behind only Finland and countries such as Singapore and Japan that traditionally dominate the league. The study found no single strategy that united the countries at the top: not even small class sizes are guarantors of success. When even the OECD admits its Pisa results are merely indicative of approximate groupings, it seems a slender basis for a curriculum revolution. But Mr Gove is a man with a mission that sometimes floats free of the evidence. He can also seem to soar above the complexity of teaching and learning. He tends to regard talk of, say the sheer variability of a class of six-year-olds, as cover for a lack of ambition. That doesn&apos;t mean his ideas are all wrong \u2013 understanding number, from fractions to computer programming, is unarguably an indispensable life skill for today&apos;s school students \u2013 but his politics can undermine his case.

In the new proposals, climate change is prominent in geography, and the rest of the world in history, while design and technology have been overhauled to reflect widespread industry criticism. The harder question to answer is why, if it is necessary for the good of the country to decide in Whitehall what state primary and secondary schools in England teach, he is exempting academies and free schools. Either it is good for schools and teachers to be free to make their own judgments, and parents to choose between them on that basis, or it isn&apos;t. If, as he insists, his national curriculum is merely a minimum standard for schools, he should not be imposing it on some of them only.

Yet explanations flit from bus-fare rises in Brazilian cities to a public park loss in Istanbul to a general distrust of politicians. The underlying common cause remains hidden from view. Consider Brazil. The mass resistance to billions of dollars of public money spent on a football spectacle is a positive development because it leads the world in spurring constructive government response \u2013 massive new public investments in public transport and education. On the other side of the globe, clashes between police and protestors over a public park in Istanbul are endlessly reported, but not the neo-liberal programme of the state under whose rule inequality has multiplied and average wages have fallen by a fifth. The underlying global issues and policy choices, however, remain blinkered out. Instead, the claim of the world&apos;s largest PR corporation that the driver of all the protests is &quot;distrust of government&quot; is featured, although this claim itself is another symptom of deeper disorder. Governments are distrusted because they have become creatures of private corporate powers funding the politicians, demonising opposition forces and systematically looting public purses and natural resources across continents.

I would agree that Germany&apos;s Mittelstand (medium-sized companies) are a special thing and I have worked in companies here where the eyes of the employees (from the youngest through to the oldest) still sparkle with pride as they watch the finished product roll out of the workshops. But I have many friends who feel that the realignment of Germany&apos;s employment market is turning what used to be a secure, fulfilling environment into a seriously unsettling and at times underpaid &quot;hire-and-fire&quot; culture which is taking its toll both on psychological wellbeing and the general quality of life. But, more than all this, we need to note Angela Merkel&apos;s resistance to EU emissions laws, with it becoming clear that Germany will block strict limits on CO2 emissions in order to protect its prestige car industry. It makes me wonder why Germany is building all those wind-turbines and implementing various other environmental measures? German car manufacturers build some of the most oversized and overpowered vehicles on the market, and Merkel&apos;s move to protect the production of these obscene status-symbols simply negates all the supposedly green policies which Germany purports to champion. But I shouldn&apos;t be surprised because commercial interest and &quot;green-washing&quot; are the order of the day, aren&apos;t they?Alan MitchamCologne, Germany False modification I have just read a piece on a scientific study of pigs fed a diet of genetically modified corn and soy and the negative impacts on the pigs stomach, uterus and general health. Your leader comment (Modify the argument, 28 June) states those pushing genetic modification of food plants ignore the substantive difference between hybridisation and introducing alien genes. They sure do, and have been making this false claim of similarity for decades. My reading of the literature points to a growing problem, not any kind of food revolution.I StreweSydney, NSW, Australia \u2022 I have always felt that the response in Britain to the introduction of GM food had more to do with BSE than GM. Many people learned from the BSE scandal that we cannot rely on the food industry to make human health and wellbeing its priority, and we cannot rely on our government to make sure they do so. Profit trumps all. In responsible hands, GM foods could probably be of great benefit to humankind, and risks could be eliminated. But where are the responsible hands? If we ever get a better organised and more sane society, the whole concept might get a better reaction, and then we might recognise the value. I&apos;m waiting.Kate BegleyNorth Shields, UK Applause for clapping Charles Nevin&apos;s column on clapping (4 July) deserves a round of applause for covering a subject we take for granted and rarely consider. It made me think of the phenomenon Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn relates in The Gulag Archipelago of the hagiographical mass meetings held in Stalinist times. Everyone was encouraged to clap ceaselessly for minutes at a time, with nobody wishing to be the first to stop lest a lack of zeal be noted. Sure enough, in one instance the director of a paper factory became the first to stop and was duly sentenced to 10 years in the gulag. Gives the idea of being clapped in jail a whole different meaning.Barrie SargeantOtaki Beach, New Zealand Rice and randomness I would like to suggest a friendly correction to Michael Blastland and David Spiegelhalter&apos;s piece, How to place a bet on the statistics (21 June). They assert that, when throwing many grains of rice out onto a calendar laid on the floor, &quot;one thing we can predict for sure is that the rice grains will not space themselves evenly&quot;. Actually, the grains might space themselves evenly (although that is a low probability event). As I discuss with my undergraduate statistics students, random does not necessarily mean uneven. This is another aspect of statistics and probability that people are often confused about. Numbers do &quot;go up and down&quot;, as the authors state, but sometimes they stay the same.Catherine OrtnerKamloops, British Columbia, Canada Briefly \u2022 A quick note to commend Gary Younge on his article Meet a New Generation of Patriotic Americans (21 June).

But there is a basic piece of the financial picture that is not yet on the books \u2013 cause and effect. Every financial transaction affects the environment, and the environment is embedded in every financial transaction. Every transaction. Our financial and environmental crises are inextricably connected \u2013 both in the causes and solutions. Much too often, one corporation&apos;s actions and assets become liabilities for other parties \u2013 taxpayers, businesses, families and natural ecosystems. I call this &quot;environmental debt&quot;, and it is as risky for financial security as subprime mortgages wrapped in credit default swaps. These are the connections we do not yet account for properly. For example, in 2011, floods in Thailand effectively shut down the country. These intense storms became catastrophic because of massive deforestation, much of which occurred in the 20th century. Without enough trees, the ground was unable to soak up the floodwater. Local Thai factories that produced car parts were closed for months. These closures caused shortages for Toyota and Honda, and both companies were forced to suspend manufacturing in Kentucky, Singapore and the Philippines. Toyota alone lost production of 260,000 vehicles (3.4% of its previous annual output) and tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs in several countries. Logging in 20th century Thailand caused financial havoc around the world in 2011 \u2013 a good 20 years after much of it occurred. The people of Thailand, several governments, numerous companies and shareholders from around the world all paid the logging&apos;s environmental debt. The financial industry is beginning to debate climate change risk management and disclosure. The Investor Network on Climate Risk is a network of more than 100 institutional investors with collective assets totalling about $11tn. Its parent organisation, Ceres, just released a blueprint for investors which states: &quot;Institutional investors and their investment managers must integrate the financial risks from climate change, resource scarcity, supply chain failures and tighter water supplies into their investment practices if they are to be successful in the 21st\u00a0century.&quot; And several leaders in the insurance industry, at serious risk from extreme weather, are suggesting the same. It&apos;s a smart start. Let us hope Ceres and its members have the clout to move this aspiration blueprint to actionable changes in global investment. Even though this connection between our environmental practices and financial wellbeing is witnessed regularly across the globe, political and business leaders most often still urge each other and the public to ignore environmental constraints in order to solve immediate economic woes. Sometimes, the folly of prioritising short-term profit over long-term value is very evident. China became a world economic power in one generation, and in April 2013, it announced that environmental degradation costs 3.5% of its annual GDP. All money is not created equal. Paying for environmental degradation is not a constructive or desirable piece of any nation&apos;s GDP. Other countries have not made similar pronouncements to China&apos;s, but certainly, environmental consequences account for a not-inconsequential piece of global GDP. Extreme weather&apos;s heavy touch on public and private budgets ranges from firefighting and crop insurance in drought-stricken areas, rescue services in flood zones, higher prices for commodities for companies and consumers, and the huge expense of rebuilding infrastructure following natural disasters. These are all big-ticket items, and their intensity and frequency are all exacerbated by climate change. Despite initiatives by private banks such as the Equator Principles and the World Bank&apos;s Natural Capital Project, project and investment finance have not changed much. No company or investor is yet paying for its pollution, and until these costs are embedded into basic operating accounts, the best intentions do not hold sway. But these initiatives have the potential to become the cornerstones for the new business model needed. In November 2011, Puma became the first multinational corporation to create an integrated report that converted environmental information and data into monetary terms. Its 2010 environmental profit and loss account, produced by PricewaterhouseCoopers and TruCost, demonstrated that 72% of Puma&apos;s profits would have disappeared if the company had paid for its environmental impacts. The report was hugely imperfect (as all accounting systems are) and an improved version is under way now. PPR, Puma&apos;s parent company, has also promised to create environmental profit and loss accounts for its entire group of luxury brands (Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, etc.) Other multinationals are also following suit. The businesses are ahead of the investors in sticking their necks out. Current accounting rules and the financial industry&apos;s obsession with quarterly reports fail all of us by limiting the best instincts of the best businesses. PepsiCo recently built a state-of-the-art factory in Arizona, and its innovations included net-zero energy and waste and a 75% reduction in water usage compared to plants of similar size. But the company is only deploying some of these brilliant engineering improvements in its factories around the world because these new technology changes are expensive. If water, energy and waste cost their true prices, Pepsi would be at an advantage for its innovation, as opposed to having to defend its decision to spend money on smart engineering and protocols. Changing accounting and reporting rules so that the biggest polluter no longer makes the biggest profit would create a more resilient economic system as well as ecosystem. The two are completely symbiotic. I propose a new framework to guide 21st century commerce. Pollution can no longer be free nor subsidised and the long view should guide all decision making and accounting. The government needs to play a vital role in catalysing clean technology and growth while preventing environmental destruction.

But savvy and talented designer Kirrily Johnston last week put her fashion label into voluntary administration, citing rocketing rents, the problems of online retail and some costly manufacturing problems \u2013 further evidence of the tough environment facing the Australian fashion industry. It was only last month that Lisa Ho decided to shut her empire due to escalating debts. And as a creative industry worth more than $10bn \u2013 as a comparison, that&apos;s almost a third of its UK equivalent (\u00a321m) \u2013 some are beginning to wonder what more could be done to encourage investment in Australian fashion. It&apos;s an argument that has been gaining ground even before Johnston and Ho shut up shop. Australia does not have a shortage of talent \u2013 but on the global stage, its fashion presence has been muted at best, diaphanous at worst. The problem then becomes entrenched: without an international reputation, it is unsurprising that so few Australian brands have successfully expanded into other territories, or Australian designers been handed the reins of a major, international fashion house. For Alison Veness-McGourty, former editor of Harper\u2019s Bazaar and current editor of 10 magazine, the problem is clear-cut: a lack of support and much-needed funds. \u201cThe government needs to put more money into the fashion industry, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d she says. For designers to really be able to reach out internationally, she believes Australia needs to inaugurate a central governing body, such as the British Fashion Council (BFC) or the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA). \u201cThe British Fashion Council is brilliant, they put so much money into getting people going. They have a great program with TopShop and other partners, that puts real commercial funding and mentorship into fashion,\u201d says Veness-McGourty. Both CFDA and BFC function as hubs for designers and the wider fashion business community \u2013 and each aims to promote its designers, foster new talent and move the whole industry forward. The Australian Fashion Council (AFC), however, seems more focused on matters such as raising professional standards than international development stage. Michel Abeysekera, president of the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia (TFIA), of which the AFC is a division, says the Council is implementing changes that will challenge criticisms that fashion designers are lost in the body\u2019s broad coverage of textiles, footwear, clothing manufacturing. \u201c[The TFIA] is not purely focused on fashion alone; however there [are] moves afoot to reinvigorate the Australian Fashion Council and elevate the fashion element to a higher level,\u201d he says. Key to the success of a reinvigorated AFC will be a commitment from industry and government to work more collaboratively on matters such as educating and motivating businesses through tough times argues AFC chairwoman and RMIT&apos;s deputy head of fashion and textiles, Karen Webster. \u201cAs more designer labels struggle, they do not have an infrastructure and resources to deal with higher overheads such as increased rentals,\u201d says Webster. \u201cIt only needs one thing to go wrong it can destroy a business.\u201d     Dion Lee: 'I think the consumer is more globally conscious' Photograph: Dion Lee    Funding will also prove crucial. The CFDA, for instance, is highly effective at raising funds through a variety of sources and offers a wide range of scholarships, initiatives with programme partners, and incubator funds. And while Australia also has commercially driven fashion awards, they don&apos;t really compare. While the CFDA/ Vogue Fashion Fund awards one emerging designer a $US 300,000 cash injection, the Qantas Spirit of Youth Awards, has a combined cash and flights package of just $AU 10,000. Of course it doesn&apos;t just come down to prize funds. High fashion labels struggle to expand (and indeed survive) without financial assistance from investors, backers or financial philanthropists. In the US the money often comes from Wall St or dot.com types with nothing more than cash and a keen eye for fashion. In Australia, it\u2019s usually an investment from a fashion conglomerate \u2013 and the problem with the model of \u201cbig fashion buying little fashion\u201d is that if retail struggles, it affects all parties. Last month it was revealed one of our brightest fashion stars, Dion Lee, had sold a percentage of his business to the Cue Clothing Co. In April, luxury goods powerhouse, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, in the form of its Singapore subsidiary equity group, L Capital, purchased just over half of iconic Australian outfitter, RM Williams. In 2011, Myer purchased 65% of Sass and Bide for a reported $42.5 million.\u00a0The same year, Kit Willow sold her fashion and lingerie label Willow to the Apparel Group, owner of Saba and Sportscraft. In 2010, Ksubi fought off liquidators with a restructure that involved an investor, the founders and major shareholders Bleach Pty Ltd, a surf apparel group. So the investors are there; it\u2019s just that they\u2019re all in the same business.     Tome: made a strategic decision to launch and base their label in New York Photograph: Tome    Another hurdle for Australian labels has been the sensitivity attached to global perceptions of our culture and style. Ryan Lobo, one half of the New York-based label Tome, who both studied fashion at the University of Technology, Sydney, believes the emergence of online shopping has helped challenge peoples\u2019 prejudices about Australian fashion. Slowly, the representation of Australian brands on global e-stores is growing. (There are currently 13 local labels out of 304 fashion brands on Net-a-Porter.) \u201cA lot of Australian designers rub shoulders with the big international names and in some respects are leaders in their fields,\u201d says Lobo. \u201cIt&apos;s no longer just about swimwear.\u201d The designer and his business partner, Ramon Martin, made a strategic decision to launch and base their label in New York citing the appeal of a fashion industry \u201cthat is very welcoming of new names and offers a diverse variety of support for designers.\u201d For Dion Lee, a designer who knows first hand the challenges of positioning a brand internationally, changing attitudes towards Australian style are happening as a flow-on from the market evolving locally. \u201cI think the consumer is more globally conscious, allowing designers to push the product further.\u00a0The world has become so much smaller and the media now allows you to communicate your brand more easily than ever before.\u201d In four quick years, Lee has quietly channelled the local momentum behind his label into an overseas strategy with a growing profile in New York and London. Now on the cusp of real international success, it will be a matter of how far (and quickly) the financial backing from Cue will allow him to grow globally. Despite the brand closures and dangerous competition from international fast-fashion stores, such as Top Shop and Zara, there is light at the end of the runway. Retail is up almost 2% according to the latest ABS trade figures. Rumours abound that LVMH\u2019s L Capital Group is still hungry, surely good news for local brands in need of a cash injection. And, there\u2019s a new crop of local designers who are capturing the world\u2019s attention with their edge and talent. The geography may make it tough, but at least we\u2019re on the map. The New Crop \u2013 four to watch.     Dion Lee: Has carried the mantle of next big thing with grace and conviction. Photograph: Wendell Levi Teodoro/Dion Lee    Dion Lee No surprises here.

Photograph: /Ellery    Ellery A previous career as a fashion stylist becomes apparent when you see the experimentation in Kym Ellery\u2019s designs. Drawing on inspirations from popular culture to the avant-garde, Ellery carefully deconstructs the very elements of design. Precision and conjecture; light and shade; weight and resistance. With a recent lawsuit with Myer now behind her \u2013 she breached an exclusive supply contract \u2013 Ellery continues to prove her talents as both a designer and businesswoman.

Greenpeace has released maps which it says show fire hotspots in the Riau province of Sumatra on plantation land owned by subsidiaries of member companies of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The companies include Jatim Jaya Perkasa \u2013 an alleged past offender which missed two deadlines to provide information to the RSPO, and palm oil giant the Sime Darby group \u2013 which the RSPO had cleared of wrongdoing earlier this week. The RSPO &quot;has failed to tackle its members&apos; role in creating the conditions that led to such a disaster, nor has it held companies accountable for the impact of their operations,&quot; said Bustar Maitar, head of Greenpeace&apos;s Indonesia forest campaign. The fire hotspots are among over 9,000 detected in the Indonesian forestry and peat lands which contributed to the worst annual haze in the region since 1997. The smoke caused by the latest slash-and-burn land clearing drifted to neighbouring countries and caused respiratory health problems, shut schools and businesses, disrupted flights and sparked diplomatic tensions. The crisis has reportedly cost $9bn in economic productivity losses for Singapore and Malaysia. After initially blaming foreign-owned plantation companies, the Indonesian president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, offered a formal apology to Malaysia and Singapore, and took the Riau administration to task for its slow response. Indonesian authorities have since arrested at least 23 people for deliberately lighting fires in Sumatra, the Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, said. Greenpeace said its information showed nearly 100 hotspots on Jatim Jaya Perkasa land, and more than 20 on plantation land owned by Bumireksa Nusasejati, part of the Malaysia-based Sime Darby group. However Sime Darby said the fires found were on areas not planted by staff but local farmers, and the company intended to increase awareness programs among the local community. Jatim Jaya Perkasa was asked to provide information to the RSPO for investigation but missed two deadlines, prompting the RSPO to say it would initiate complaint proceedings. It then submitted the maps but in an unusable format. The company was also found in 2003 by the World Wildlife Fund to have engaged in slash and burn land clearing. Guardian Australia tried contacting the company several times but no available contact details were current. Greenpeace also named agriculture giant Wilmar International \u2013 the parent company of Australian sugar and biofuel producer Sucrogen \u2013 as a company with hotspots on its land, but did not provide further data. Wilmar has previously said it would cut ties with any suppliers found to be engaging in illegal land clearing. Wilmar&apos;s head of corporate social responsibility and sustainability, Jeremy Goon, confirmed &quot;categorically&quot; to Guardian Australia that the company had a strict policy on no burning, and would cut ties with suppliers who did it. &quot;We also have had daily fire monitoring on all of our locations and areas for the last six years and again can categorically state we have no fires on our plantations,&quot; Goon said. &quot;When I received the fire report yesterday there was again nothing of note.&quot; Greenpeace has since been contacted for further comment and clarification on the allegations. Greenpeace said its investigation pointed to a wider problem among the industry which is being ignored by the RSPO, which only investigated member companies who had been named in the media, not all member companies in the Sumatran region. &quot;Rather than claiming the innocence of members who&apos;ve been reported in the media, the RSPO needs to address the real problem \u2013 years of peatland drainage and destruction which is labelled &apos;sustainable&apos; under RSPO rules and has laid the foundation for these disastrous fires,&quot; said Maitar. The RSPO announced this week that it had investigated and cleared four of its five member companies who were reportedly implicated in the Indonesian forest fires, however it added that, &quot;the analysis has been carried out solely on the concessions that the RSPO has specifically requested&quot;. It had earlier said that the first three companies to be cleared had had no hot spots identified within their plantations. &quot;There were, however, a few hot spots present in a minority of the areas,&quot; it said. &quot;These hotspots were correctly managed by the respective companies and were extinguished within 24 hours from their appearance.&quot; The RSPO described these plantations as apparent &quot;safe havens&quot; when compared with &quot;rampant hot spots&quot; in areas nearby.  It added that the maps of concession areas publicly available from Indonesia&apos;s forestry ministry and other agencies differed to the current maps supplied by the five members. &quot;Further clarification is therefore needed from these agencies about the precise concession boundaries,&quot; it said. The illegal slashing-and-burning conducted by farmers and plantation companies in the Sumatran forests and peatlands is a cheap way to clear land for agricultural use. WWF claimed nearly 40% of the more than 9,000 detected hotspots mapped by Nasa satellites overlapped with large-scale pulpwood concessions or oil palm plantations. The production of palm oil \u2013 which is in at least 50% of products on supermarket shelves \u2013 is a contentious and high-profile environmental and consumer issue. Activists lay the blame for the near-extinction of the Sumatran orangutan on destruction of their habitat, much of it for palm oil plantations, and recent research suggested it may be also a big contributor to climate change."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-eco-houses-around-world", "sentences": ["Photograph: Vo Trong Nghia Architects    Vietnam: Stacking Green, in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, earned architecture practice Vo Trong Nghia the coveted best house award at the World Architecture Festival in Singapore in October 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-12T12:03:00Z", "title": "Eco houses around the world", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Technology", "Scaling up", "Sustainability"], "article": "   The eco-friendly timber cottage can be expanded at low cost by adding modules.

With its Suboxone tablets out of patent, Reckitt has been trying to encourage the use of its film version instead, which is still protected from generic competition. But a US healthcare provider, CVS CareMark, has just announced it is dropping the film version of Suboxone from the list of medicines available under its insurance cover, prompting new fears about the treatment&apos;s future growth. The news sent Reckitt down 252p or 5% to \u00a346.77, making it the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 yesterday. Credit Suisse analyst Charlie Mills put a neutral rating on the company but cut his price target from \u00a349 to \u00a346.50. He said:  CVSC clearly appears to have decided that film and tablet are effectively the same product and so is steering its customers to the cheaper [generic] version...It is hard to see others won&apos;t follow suit (though we have no evidence this has happened yet). This opens the prospect of Reckitt losing not only the cash payers for Suboxone, but also a decent proportion of those on insurance plans as well. We estimate 15% of Suboxone users pay cash, 10% Medicaid, 70% third party insurance, 5% others.  How to model this is far from an exact science, but we will assume 50% of the insured patients are lost in 2014, along with all the cash buyers. This is materially worse than we had before, with a 5% cut to 2014 earnings, and 10% in 2015 (when all insured patients are lost, leaving just Medicaid/others). We cut our valuation for Suboxone to \u00a31.1bn (was \u00a32.9bn). The [remainder of Reckitt] we believe is in better shape and trading well, but if Suboxone is only worth \u00a31.1bn then the implied PE on the rest is 20.5 times (2014), and is beginning to look rather fully valued.  Overall, with further comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke playing down fears of an early end to its bond buying programme, markets recorded another positive week. There was a touch of caution yesterday as Chinese officials hinted at lower than expected economic growth, while in the eurozone Portugal&apos;s continuing political crisis sent its bond yields sharply higher. Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said:  It would appear that comments from the Chinese finance minister that the world&apos;s second biggest economy could well miss its growth target for this year have taken some of the edge off the exuberance of the last two days though core European equity markets continue to remain underpinned on the prospects for continued central bank support from the Federal Reserve.  Southern Europe has been another story entirely with Portuguese markets getting hit on political uncertainty there, and the Spanish IBEX being hit by talk of a new energy bill which will raise prices to consumers as a part of electricity sector reform with the government slashing subsidies on renewables.  So the FTSE 100 finished at 6544.94, up just 1.53 points on the day but almost 170 points ahead over the week. Banks were in the spotlight, with growing talk that a sale of shares in Lloyds Banking Group could happen sooner rather than later. At the start of the week Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek and a consortium of institutional investors were both said to have approached the UK government about buying part of its stake in Lloyds. Then came reports that up to 5% of Lloyds&apos; shares - worth up to \u00a35bn - could be sold to institutions in September, a few weeks after its interim results. This would be following by a sale of another chunk of the government&apos;s stake to retail investors. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:  [Selling shares to the public] may be politically astute but could be difficult to execute, in our view. However, whatever the ultimate outcome is, we think the government will be careful to ensure that an initial share sale is structured to avoid any potential overhang, thus damaging the prospect for future sales.  We believe news of a planned share sale could coincide with or come soon after the company announces its interim results on 1 August. We expect these results to have an upbeat tone given the recently strengthened capital position of Lloyds (following a series of asset disposals) and given the improving outlook for the UK economy and housing market. We also expect firmer guidance on plans to resume dividend payments to ordinary shareholders, with our forecasts now assuming a 1.5p final dividend will be proposed this year.  Lloyds closed 1.48p higher at 67.73p while the other taxpayer controlled bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, rose 0.4p to 304.4p. Insurer Resolution climbed 10.5p to 318.5p after Nomura raised its rating from reduce to neutral and its target price from 250p to 311p, while ITV added 3.9p to 157.9p as Exane BNP Paribas put an outperform rating on the broadcaster with a 170p target. But with talk of a Chinese slowdown, the week&apos;s revival in commodity companies went into reverse yesterday. Mexican silver miner Fresnillo fell 37p to 981p while Anglo American dropped 42.5p to 1294.5p. Experian dipped 16p to \u00a311.83 on profit taking after the credit data specialist said it was on track to meet its growth targets for the year. British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco failed to benefit from yesterday&apos;s news that the government had postponed plans to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. Instead investors noted reports the companies could be interested in a possible bid for cigar and snuff specialist Swedish Match, as they seek expansion to make up for a declining market for traditional cigarettes. Another competitive threat comes from electronic cigarettes, which vaporise nicotine to give users their fix without smoke or carcinogenic risks. Earlier in the week Canaccord Genuity said e-cigarettes would be the most significant development in the history of the tobacco industry:  We estimate the e-cigarette market will grow from $2bn in 2012 to $3bn in 2013 (tobacco is approximately $700bn). In the longer term, the total combined market will shrink at a more rapid rate than most investors envisage as e-cigarettes wean smokers off tobacco, but do not attract new users into the overall category.   It tipped BAT, down 19p at \u00a334.76, as being better prepared for e-cigarettes than Imperial, 23p lower at \u00a322.50. Meanwhile Swedish Match added nearly 6%, valuing the business at around \u00a35bn. Invensys led the FTSE 250 risers following overnight news of a possible \u00a33.3bn or 505p a share offer from France&apos;s Schneider Electric, adding 67.9p to 508p. Finally, Oxford Instruments closed 120p higher at \u00a313.70 after a positive update from the technology group, which showed improving orders, sales and profits in the third month of the first quarter after a slow start to the year. Analyst Scott Cagehin at Numis Securities said:  We believe that the shares should start to trade higher after recent weakness and retain our positive stance as we believe that Oxford is a high quality business that possesses defensive characteristics. Structural demand for Oxford&apos;s product portfolio is apparent and we believe that these factors, along with new products, technology upgrades and market share gains, position Oxford strongly to grow in excess of general global GDP growth.  Demand for Oxford&apos;s products is being driven by the shift to smaller applications and the ability to analyse and manipulate matter at the atomic level. As a consequence, nanotechnology research is growing strongly with funding levels expected to increase between 10%-20% per annum, creating a good platform for growth. Additionally, industrial facing hand-held applications are set to enjoy good demand, with increasing requirements from industry to analyse on the ground, increase productivity and comply with tighter regulatory testing requirements.

The Australian Maritime Search and Rescue Authority (Amsa) made the decision to end the aerial and water-based search for the missing eight people on Saturday night, after 88 survivors and the body of a child less than one-year-old had been plucked from the water. A standard review by customs and border protection will go ahead, as well as a state coronial investigation into the death of the young boy, the coroner&apos;s court of Western Australia confirmed to Guardian Australia. &quot;The most recent asylum seeker boat capsized out of the jurisdiction of the coroner so the missing persons will not be investigated unless the bodies are recovered and brought to Christmas Island,&quot; a spokeswoman said. However, asylum seeker advocates and critics of Australia&apos;s border protection expressed concerns that the length of time it took rescuers to reach this and other vessels in distress had cost lives. &quot;We are concerned at the increasing number of people drowning at sea,&quot; Pamela Curr, campaign co-ordinator from the asylum seeker resource centre (ASRC), told Guardian Australia. &quot;It is within the context of an increased number of boats but you would also think that with that increasing number of boats that the level of response would also increase.&quot; Curr said the ASRC was concerned that the politics entrenched in the issue of asylum seeker boat arrivals was encroaching on search and rescue policy. &quot;Our concern is that we know people are notifying Amsa and it seems that [Amsa] may be directed to spend more time than is necessary in verifying the calls before responding,&quot; she said. &quot;In no way are we questioning the courage or the efficiency of the rescuers. I want to make that clear. &quot; The Australian maritime search and rescue manual dictates that &quot;in general a [search and rescue] incident is considered imminent or actual when it is apparent that persons are, or may be, in distress or when a request for assistance has been received&quot;. Former Australian ambassador Tony Kevin, a strong critic of Australia&apos;s border protection system, told Guardian Australia a response of initial disbelief had developed within the search and rescue &quot;bureaucracies&quot; when it came to asylum seeker boats, and a &quot;shirking of responsibility&quot; to Indonesia. Kevin said there was almost an assumption that asylum seekers had &quot;to prove they&apos;re in distress, I think, before anything can be done to help them&quot;. &quot;When one analyses the history of these events, one does see a pattern of delayed response, of trying \u2013 in some cases \u2013 to bump the responsibilities to the Indonesians,&quot; he said, &quot;although our search and rescue agency knows that [the Indonesians] are not able for various reasons to handle it effectively. &quot;Everybody holds themselves in readiness but no one actually does anything, and people die. &quot;It&apos;s a question of when do the maritime rescue and border protection authorities choose to rescue a boat and when do they choose unaccountably to just wait and see what happens?&quot; Amsa strongly rejected Kevin&apos;s accusations. &quot;The Australian Maritime Safety Authority takes all calls for assistance seriously,&quot; a spokeswoman told Guardian Australia. &quot;We have a team of dedicated search and rescue professionals working around the clock to receive calls, to assess the assistance required and then to organise the appropriate assistance as quickly as can practically be done.&quot; Border protection command (BPC) also reacted strongly to Kevin&apos;s statements over the weekend that the rescue effort in this latest incident reflected a &quot;disdain&quot; for asylum seekers, and said his claims &quot;are without foundation, offensive and reflect a profound misunderstanding of maritime operations in this area. Any suggestion BPC applies a different operational approach to asylum seeker vessels, as opposed to any other vessel requesting assistance, is completely false,&quot; said a statement. The head of customs and border protection Michael Pezzullo said on Monday morning that distress calls from asylum seeker boats were &quot;the equivalent of receiving multiple triple-0 calls&quot; for authorities. &quot;Amsa has to make some very fine line decisions about how to task very scarce resources, some of which might be merchant ships in the area, some might be our vessels,&quot; Pezzullo told Radio National. The issue in the latest case is the number of hours it took for authorities to direct search and rescue to the vessel after the AFP received a call from a Melbourne man at 11.15am on Friday, reporting that he had been called by a passenger on the boat who said they were in distress. Almost four hours passed before authorities believed they had located the boat and broadcast a call to nearby shipping to assist \u2013 which a Singapore tanker answered \u2013 and another 90 minutes before a customs vessel, the ACV Triton, was readied. After the AFP received further distress calls around 4.30pm, the Triton was told to head north to the stricken vessel, reaching it at approximately 10pm, around the same time as the tanker. Half an hour later a wave swamped the boat, capsizing it. Customs personnel in two tenders and a life raft from the Triton, reportedly with the assistance of the merchant tanker, began rescuing people from the water. HMAS Albany and HMAS Bathurst were called for extra assistance. By 2.20am on Saturday, 88 people had been rescued from the water and the body of the boy recovered. The Albany arrived at 4am. A search for eight people still missing began, involving two navy patrol boats, the merchant vessel and three aircraft, but was called off at around 10pm Saturday night &quot;based on the high probability that anyone alive would have been found during the day and on medical advice on survivability&quot;, Amsa said. The 88 survivors of the tragedy are currently in the Christmas Island detention centre undergoing security and identity checks. They are from Iran, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka and are believed to have joined the boat in Indonesia. A Department of Immigration spokesman told Guardian Australia on Sunday it was providing psychological care and counselling to the survivors and would &quot;continue to provide whatever care they do require&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/new-centres-excellence-water-technology-innovation", "sentences": ["There is competition all around the world, including major clusters in the US, such as Ohio, Massachusetts, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and California; Ontario and British Columbia in Canada; and Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands.", "Five came from Canada, five from Israel, four from Australia and three from Singapore.", "Singapore, for instance, despite claiming just three top 50 companies, is home to a cluster of more than 100, as well as 25 research centres.", "&quot;Supportive local utilities such as Mekorot in Israel and PUB in Singapore can make the difference by providing testing and validation opportunities within the context of a working utility."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-15T13:41:00Z", "title": "The countries vying to be the centres of excellence for water technology", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability"], "article": "The technocrats of Masdar could hardly be accused of a lack of ambition. The five-year-old Masdar City in Abu Dhabi, which aims to be the world&apos;s first zero-carbon city, aspires also to be a global centre of excellence for innovative clean-tech water companies. &quot;Masdar can be the Silicon Valley of water,&quot; says Mohammed El Ramahi, Masdar&apos;s head of utilities and asset management. He is certain that this part of the Middle East can be to water what California is to the microchip. With predictions that the water tech industry \u2013 covering desalination, purification, recycling, rainwater collection and hydro-electricity \u2013 will be worth $1tn by 2020, it is perhaps no surprise that Abu Dhabi wants in on the action. Revolutionary technology Finding an affordable desalination technology to transform the planet&apos;s vast supplies of unusable, salty water for consumption and re-use by people and industry is the modern alchemist&apos;s dream. But El Ramahi is confident that Masdar could be the birthplace for such a revolutionary technology. &quot;It will create desalination solutions which are completely viable and capable to be utilised in less fortunate communities,&quot; he says. Masdar is not alone, however. There is competition all around the world, including major clusters in the US, such as Ohio, Massachusetts, Milwaukee, Wisconsin and California; Ontario and British Columbia in Canada; and Singapore, Denmark and the Netherlands. &quot;The prize is an enormous economic engine that [will] create jobs \u2013 expensive jobs,&quot; says Laura Shenkar, principal of Artemis Water Strategy, a consultancy based in San Francisco. Shenkar organises The Artemis Project Top 50, an annual ranking of the most promising water tech companies. The United States claimed top spot in 2012, being home to 29 of the top 50. Five came from Canada, five from Israel, four from Australia and three from Singapore. It would be wrong, however, to write off the other territories. Singapore, for instance, despite claiming just three top 50 companies, is home to a cluster of more than 100, as well as 25 research centres. With the right ingredients, Shenkar says \u2013 venture capital, academic institutions and fierce competition \u2013 a jurisdiction will attract emerging tech companies and lay an &quot;egg for economic growth&quot;. Long-term investment According to Ian Elkins, editor of Global Water Intelligence, a news and information service, the biggest challenge facing any new water technology, no matter how brilliant it may be on paper, is the time it takes to get a technology to market. Finding a jurisdiction where the local water utility company is open-minded about providing a test bed for new technologies is therefore incredibly important for emerging companies. &quot;Unlike the telecommunications or IT sectors, where take-up of new technologies is virtually instantaneous, it generally takes at least seven years for any new water technology to gain serious traction. During that time it will need sustained funding to keep it going through to commercialisation,&quot; Elkins says. &quot;Supportive local utilities such as Mekorot in Israel and PUB in Singapore can make the difference by providing testing and validation opportunities within the context of a working utility. The resulting performance data can then be used to support the commercialisation of the technology,&quot; he adds. Innovation by necessity North America may have topped out in the Artemis Top 50, but John Carr, general manager of water and mining at Clean TeQ, an Artemis Top 50 firm based in Melbourne, Australia, specialising in ion exchange and membrane processes, contends that those jurisdictions facing serious water scarcity issues may, in the long term, have the edge. &quot;Necessity is the mother of invention, so areas where water availability is low tends to lead to the highest level of innovation,&quot; Carr says. For such reasons, Australia should be watched closely, he suggests. &quot;Australia ticks all the boxes for an innovation hub for water technology. It has an advanced R&amp;D base with its universities and institutions, strong government support, several large industries with high water demand and water availability which ranges from scarce to drought,&quot; he adds. In the same vein, the rain-starved Middle East could well become home to several powerful water tech industries. Israel is one country in the region playing host to a successful cluster. The state recycles around 85% of waste water and its 300 or so water companies, specialising in desalination, waste water and irrigation technologies, earn it more than $2bn annually in exports. &quot;Slowly, large parts of the world [are] understanding what Israel had to understand 60 years ago,&quot; says Gilad Peled, director of agro-technology, water and environment at the Israeli Export Institute, adding that revenue has &quot;increased by 300% in the last five years&quot;. &quot;To understand what makes Israel a centre for excellence for water technologies you have to go back in history and understand the geography of the country \u2013 Israel is a small country with small resources of sweet water and a fast growing population,&quot; he says. &quot;It is not only the technologies that attracts global interests but the different way of thinking.&quot; Water ambition Peled and his team are gearing up for WATEC 2013 in Tel Aviv in October, a conference designed to showcase its expertise in the water tech sector. The last event in 2011 attracted 20,000 participants, including 5,000 from overseas. Peled hopes Israel will one day be seen as &quot;the Silicon Valley of water&quot;. &quot;We at the Israeli Export Institute will continue to do everything to reach this dream.&quot; Meanwhile, Masdar is similarly ambitious. Where will the nascent city&apos;s water tech industry be in 10 years&apos; time? &quot;On the moon \u2013 if not higher,&quot; replies a supremely confident El Ramahi. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 July 2013 to reflect that Masdar City is five years old and not seven as originally written.

After Basel and Miami, the leading western art show has invested in the former British colony. Art dealers, collectors and the merely curious enjoyed an artistic &quot;fusion&quot; in late May that mixed bankable western artists with Asian stars. But the east-west paradigm is not the only one at play in the contemporary art market; a pan-Asian shift is under way and local identities are being asserted. The art market, as usually understood by the players in the art world, has moved to Hong Kong to meet Asia, and is being transformed in the process. Unnoticed by the west, the Asia-Pacific region has developed several artistic centres and is now determined to assert its own tastes and preferences, with no regard for what some would call western diktats. This awakening of contemporary art in Asia is backed by abundant regional cash. According to a 2012 study by consultants Capgemini, there are more millionaires in Asia than in the United States. To lure them to the cause of art, quality art fairs have burgeoned since 2007 in Dubai, New Delhi, Hong Kong and Singapore, with the next one, the Sydney Contemporary, due in September. They share a common characteristic, which is that the Asian component dominates. The stars here are not British (Damien Hirst) or American (Jeff Koons and Richard Prince), but Chinese (Liu Wei), Iranian (Farhad Moshiri) and Indonesian (Eko Nugroho). Every country begins its artistic initiation with its own artists. People start out liking what they know \u2013 in other words what they recognise. In Asia, collectors are paying big money to acquire works by artists perceived as national heroes, and consequently propelling artists with only a local reputation and the occasional mention in public catalogues, to stardom. Few people outside Indonesia have heard of Nyoman Masriadi, but in 2008 he sold a painting for $1m at Sotheby&apos;s. For years, countries remained focused on their own artistic scenes, but today mentalities are changing. Collectors are no longer satisfied with pushing up the value of their national treasures but are broadening their spectrum to include the whole of Asia. That is where the novelty lies. Previously, after getting a national collection together, Asian art lovers would eye the west but ignore their immediate neighbours. &quot;Today if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in Indonesia or South Korea, then you&apos;re not going to understand what&apos;s happening in Belgium,&quot; said Hallam Chow, a Hong Kong-based art collector who buys works by Indonesian artists as well as Chinese ones. Some dealers such as Jean-Marc Decrop, who specialises in Chinese contemporary art, expect the Middle East and Far East to draw closer artistically. &quot;Most Indonesian collectors I know are Muslim and do the Hajj pilgrimage. I know at least five who would like to collect art from the Arab world,&quot; he said. He has just opened the first gallery in Hong Kong to bring together contemporary Arab, Iranian and Turkish artists along with young artists from South-East Asia, Tibet and Central Asia. Asian institutions are following suit. In 2012, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo held an exhibition called Arab Express. One consequence of this interregional dialogue is that the west is no longer the sole reference point for Asian artists who are now equally happy to be exhibiting in Asia. &quot;What&apos;s happening in London or New York remains important of course, but so is what&apos;s happening in Mumbai, Jogjakarta or Tokyo,&quot; observed Philip Tinari, director of the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art  in Beijing, which hosted the Indian Highway exhibition in 2012. This all takes time. The mainland Chinese did not develop a sudden passion for Indian art after the Indian Highway exhibition, but the seeds were sown. The market will require structuring for them to grow. A well-organised art market is based on a foundation of collectors, experts and art critics as well as museums, galleries and auction houses (in other words a first and second market), in addition to framers, insurers, transporters and even specialised bankers. Only Japan and two of the four &quot;Asian Dragons&quot;, Taiwan and South Korea, currently have all the components of this artistic ecosystem. In South Korea powerful galleries have been forming the tastes of rich buyers for the past 30 years, while in Taiwan collectors are mainly descended from the Japan-influenced elite that emerged during the Japanese occupation (1895-1945) and the Chinese bourgeoisie that fled from the mainland with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. Elsewhere the situation varies considerably from one country to another, with a massive contrast between the millionaire Chinese artists and the &quot;peasant&quot; artists in countries that are still essentially rural, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. But the curiosity is there. Not all Asian countries have achieved the same degree of maturity but they are all preparing to meet their cultural ambitions by opening museums. Some countries such as Singapore have a policy of supporting art and culture, and even the Chinese government has understood that imperialism can be cultural too. According to the British monthly, The Art Newspaper, the number of museums in China rose from 21 in 1949 to 348 in 1978 and 3,400 today, 175 of which are dedicated to visual art. Many however, are still empty shells. In India things are moving slowly but surely. Contemporary art is still only for a tiny elite and New Delhi&apos;s National Museum of Modern Art has a low visitor rate of 18,000 per year (the Louvre, in contrast, has 10 million). Despite that, Kolkata is planning to open the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art in 2015, a 23,000 sq metre building designed by Herzog &amp; De Meuron that will mainly serve Asian art. That is also the ambition of the M+ Museum of Visual Culture, which is due to open in Hong Kong by the end of 2017 and will be twice as large as London&apos;s Tate Modern. The director, Lars Nittve, intends to devote 70% of his acquisitions budget of $218m spread over five years to Asian artists. The curators of the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, also due to open in 2017, will devote 50% of their collection to Asia, in the broadest geographical sense of the word. Asia&apos;s emergence on the artistic scene is therefore more that a mere geographic shift. Western sellers are getting in touch with Asian buyers and this is triggering a radical overhaul reminiscent of the migration of the art markets from the European capitals to New York in the early 20th century and the dominance of the American schools that followed. Asia is as diverse as it is vast and we may soon expect a multitude of Asian schools, art fairs and new collectors endeavouring to show their supremacy to the rest of the world.

The bribery allegations have been hanging over Ecclestone&apos;s head since the jailing, for eight and a half years last year, of Gerhard Gribkowsky, the BayernLB bank executive who was found guilty of taking $44m (\u00a329m) in bribes and failing to pay tax on the money. Gribkowsky said he received the money from Ecclestone in 2006 and 2007 in relation to the sale of F1 rights to CVC. Ecclestone, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, said he paid the money because Gribkowsky had threatened to blackmail him. Ecclestone has said that he could be removed from his position in charge of F1 if found guilty. But, in a sense, his guilt or otherwise is not the problem for F1 right now. It is the prospect of Ecclestone being dragged through long months of court proceedings, a major distraction as the sport plans a flotation in Singapore. CVC are already believed to have drawn up a shortlist of possible successors to replace Ecclestone. That was more to do with his age than anything else.

Steve Nechelput, who has served as GSK&apos;s finance chief in China for a year, tried to fly out of the country three weeks ago but was told he had been banned from leaving. GSK said Nechelput, who has worked for the company for 23 years with stints in Mexico, Singapore and the US, has not been questioned, arrested or detained by the police and is free to continue working and travelling within China. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said diplomats were aware of an incident involving Nechelput and are providing consular assistance. Nechelput, from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, lives in Shanghai with his wife and two small children. News of the travel ban comes after Chinese police raised concerns that Mark Reilly, the head of GSK&apos;s Chinese operations, left the country shortly after the bribery investigation was announced on 27 June and has not returned. Asked about Reilly&apos;s decision to leave the country, Gao Feng, the head of China&apos;s fraud unit, said: &quot;You had better ask him yourself why he has left China and is not willing to return so far.&quot; A GSK spokesman said Reilly returned to the UK for long-scheduled meetings. He declined to state if or when Reilly would return to China. Chinese police have detained four senior GSK executives, all Chinese nationals, as part of the investigation that stretches back to 2007 and involves deals worth 3bn yuan (\u00a3320m). GSK is alleged to have played a &quot;godfather&quot; role at the centre of a network of more than 700 intermediaries and travel agencies used to bribe doctors and lawyers with cash and sexual\u00a0favours. Gao claimed the Chinese authorities had evidence that &quot;bribery is a core part&quot; of GSK&apos;s business. &quot;In order to win the favour of GSK, some travel agencies don&apos;t just offer money to their executives but also sexual bribes,&quot; he added.

The money we spent running the business accounted for about 20-30% of the drug price. To have contact with some government departments you need money that you cannot normally expense to the company.&quot; The Chinese Food and Drug Administration indicated that the probe into GSK&apos;s activities would be extended to other drug companies. &quot;We must resolutely punish illegal acts, resolutely close illegal enterprises and firmly recall problematic products,&quot; Wu Zhen, a deputy director of the agency, said.

Ecclestone, who will be 83 in October, announced on Wednesday that he had been indicted by German prosecutors following his payment of $44m (\u00a329m) to Gerhard Gribkowsky of Bayern Landesbank to smooth the sale of a 47% stake in the sport to its current owners, the private equity company CVC Capital Partners, in 2006. Last year Gribkowsky was jailed for eight and a half years for not paying tax on the payments, breach of trust towards his former employers and being in receipt of corrupt payments from Ecclestone. Ecclestone, who has always insisted that he was not guilty of any wrongdoing, admits making the payment to Gribkowsky. He said he had been &quot;shaken down&quot; by Gribkowsky, who had threatened to go to HM Revenue and Customs with &quot;false evidence&quot;, claiming that he was more involved in the running of his family trust, Bambini Holdings, than he should have been. Ecclestone, the former used car salesman who is worth an estimated \u00a34bn, confirmed the news of his indictment on Wednesday when he said: &quot;I have just spoken to my lawyers and they have received an indictment. It&apos;s being translated into English.&quot; His D\u00fcsseldorf lawyer Sven Thomas, said: &quot;The clear viewpoint of the defence remains, that Mr Ecclestone is guilty neither of bribery or of participation in embezzlement&quot;. The news broke as Ecclestone&apos;s representatives attended a court hearing in London to fight claims by Constantin Medien, the media company, who says it lost out by $171m because F1 was undersold. Ecclestone added: &quot;We are defending it properly. It will be an interesting case. It&apos;s a pity it&apos;s happened.&quot; He described the serving of the indictment as &quot;inevitable,&quot; adding: &quot;If someone wants to sue you, they can do it and you have to defend it.&quot; He said in May: &quot;The problem is that when you pay someone, it&apos;s always there. I&apos;d never been in a position where someone could cause so much damage. I had to keep him close to keep him quiet. Or else cut his tongue out.&quot; If found guilty, Ecclestone could be jailed for 10 years. He said in May: &quot;The board [of CVC] agrees I should stay unless I&apos;m convicted.&quot; Earlier, he said: &quot;[CVC] will probably be forced to get rid of me if the Germans come after me. It&apos;s pretty obvious, if I&apos;m locked up.&quot; But even without a conviction, Ecclestone has enormous problems. The prospect of a lengthy court battle \u2013 which is unlikely to take place before the end of the year \u2013 would be a damaging distraction for a sport which boasts an annual income of \u00a31.5bn. Only football has a bigger global TV audience. The $12bn (\u00a38bn) flotation of F1, already postponed once and now planned for Singapore this autumn, could be put off again. There is much speculation in Germany that based on similar financial crime cases and due to Ecclestone&apos;s advanced age, it is possible that he will be offered the chance to reach an out-of-court settlement. Ecclestone also faces civil actions in Germany and America, and could be handed an enormous bill if investigations into his tax affairs go against him. Ecclestone once said: &quot;In Formula One, everyone cheats. The trick is not to get caught.&quot; In December the Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo said: &quot;If Bernie is charged I think he will be the first to step back in the interests of Formula One. This could be bad for F1.&quot; Some team bosses \u2013 and most of them have been loaned money by Ecclestone when in trouble \u2013 remain fiercely loyal to him, at least in public. Others point out that the man who once described women as &quot;domestic appliances&quot; and praised Hitler for being &quot;able to get things done&quot; is an anachronism in the 21st century. They also claim that largely because of Ecclestone the sport has done little to embrace new technology. Then there is the argument that most of the profits made by Ecclestone for his employers, CVC, are not seen by the teams and what money there is unfairly distributed. All but a handful of the 11 F1 outfits \u2013 Ferrari, Red Bull, Mercedes and McLaren \u2013 are in some form of financial difficulty. Among those suggested as possible replacements for Ecclestone are Justin King, the Sainsbury&apos;s boss, and Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League. The most likely replacement, though, would be Christian Horner, the man who has led Red Bull to a hat-trick of drivers&apos; and constructors&apos; world championships. Horner is the team principal closest to Ecclestone and has also been the most successful in recent seasons. But everyone in the F1 paddock agrees that there is no like-for-like replacement for Bernie Ecclestone."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/18/el-raco-de-can-fabes-barcelona-restaurant", "sentences": ["It acquired its first Michelin star in 1988, the second in 1991 and maintained the coveted three stars from 1994 until shortly after Santamaria died of a heart attack in Singapore in 2011."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-18T17:59:43Z", "title": "Spanish restaurant El Rac\u00f3 de Can Fabes to close after 32 years", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Spain", "Europe", "World news", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Business"], "article": "El Rac\u00f3 de Can Fabes, one of the first Spanish restaurants to be awarded a Michelin star, is to close at the end of next month after 32 years.

The gap in cognitive development between children from advantaged and disadvantaged homes is observable long before they reach primary as anyone working in the nursery (pre-five) sector will testifyschool. Tests are no substitute for the in-depth knowledge nursery staff have of children in their charge. Parents know this and so when Michael Forsyth tried to introduce national testing in Scotland in the early 1990s, it was a revolt by parents, advantaged and disadvantaged alike, that caused him to revise his plans So let&apos;s invest, heavily, in early years education. Let&apos;s use it to identify children already falling behind their peers and let&apos;s intervene with programmes that emphasise play, reading for pleasure, socialisation and empathy.Brian BoydEmeritus professor of education, University of Strathclyde \u2022 It is impossible to see what contribution comparing pupils will make to raising standards. Standards only have meaning in relation to what children actually achieve. What children can do, understand and know is assessed in terms of criteria. Ideally, these would be criteria that are intrinsic to the material being learned. When children achieve these criteria it might be feasible to say they have reached a particular standard. But to know that a child has achieved more or less than the next person gives no such information at all. Sue CoxSchool of Education and Lifelong Learning, University of East Anglia \u2022 We are concerned about plans to place all pupils in a league table ranked according to ability. Rather than a philosophy of &quot;every child matters&quot;, this would be a world where only the person at the top counts. Any child struggling to pass tests due to a special educational need would be automatically labelled a failure. Last month a conference brought together teachers, parents, governors and teacher educators to launch the primary charter and produce a &quot;manifesto&quot; for primary schools, outlining a model for how pupils learn best. This includes trusting the judgment of teachers, allowing children to learn at their own pace and through play, while taking account of their own experiences. It involves giving pupils an opportunity to develop a love of learning and nurturing their ability to interact with others. We have already seen the damage done to children in this country through over-testing. Research has shown that our children are more worried about tests than in any other developed country. Crucially, there is no evidence to show that testing and ranking children improves their learning, but plenty that demonstrates the effect being labelled a failure has on self-esteem. We prefer to look to the model of education in Finland, where there are no inspections, no punitive lesson observations and minimal testing, yet we see consistently high standards, huge levels of teacher satisfaction, minimal social selection and an education sector that is lauded throughout the world. Instead,\u00a0this government wants to test children earlier and force a more formal education, where learning by rote and parroting facts will be driven right down into the early years. We suspect this is part of a move to hand publicly owned education over to the private sector though an increase in the number of schools forced to become academies.

The Singapore system takes place in a sort of Chinese 1984 where the meanings of words are changed, if not on a daily basis, then at least seasonally. Peter Wilby (Primary school tests follow the Piccadilly Circus rule, 18 July) mentions the use of cliches, such as wanting schools to be &quot;world-class&quot;. &quot;Excellence&quot; is one of Singapore&apos;s favourites. Yet many of the truly excellent Singaporean educators are frightened of a lack of creativity in their schools to the extent that that government has listened and tried to do something about this. But my intention is not to criticise their system, but rather to point out the catastrophic effects the current UK government&apos;s tragic misconception of education will have and is having. Education by audit is contrary to the natural gift which is education. Once you try to audit a developmental process you kill what you wish to encourage. As in Singapore, the terminology with which we used to be able to discuss the true pedagogical issues has been dismantled by those in power with the result that proper educational discourse is well-nigh impossible. But of course, this is exactly what the government wants.Professor John MatthewsLondon \u2022 Of course, Tory backbenchers will be &quot;salivating at the prospect&quot;, as Peter Wilby is absolutely correct to suggest, that this consultation document will see the return of the 11-plus, selection and grammar schools. The irony is that the document was issued by Nick Clegg, the very man who objected to Michael Gove&apos;s attempts to bring back O-levels because they would lead to a two-tier system of education.

A vast, rambling farmhouse, the building appears to have been extended, over and over again, by someone whose enthusiasm for the task isn&apos;t entirely matched by their aptitude. The farm is home to both a horse sanctuary and an open-sided Dutch barn, entirely filled with the rusting skeletons of Citro\u00ebn 2CVs. The exterior walls of the main building are decorated with hand-painted murals of biblical scenes. HELP US GET THE KIDS OFF THE STREETS SUFFER LITTLE CHILDREN offers one. JESUS THE ORIGINAL TOUGH GUY HERO suggests another. Nor would you pick South Perton Farm&apos;s proprietor, Billy Wilson, as the progenitor of a\u00a0global phenomenon. A former Grenadier Guard, hairdresser, nightclub owner and marathon organiser who won&apos;t reveal his age, he sports an Edwardian moustache and, in public, usually affects a Windsor Davies-ish sergeant major persona going by the name of Mr Mouse. If\u00a0anything, Mr Mouse seems marginally less eccentric than the man behind the character. Over the course of a day with him, Wilson will tell me that &quot;in the not-too-distant future&quot; scientists are going to prove that telepathy exists; claim that he has unearthed magical powers while digging a\u00a0lake in the farmhouse grounds; and, at one diverting juncture, announce that he can attach a\u00a0rope to his penis and pull a car tyre along with it. Wilson is the father of what one US magazine, Outside, has called &quot;America&apos;s fastest-growing sport&quot;: endurance obstacle racing. He started the Tough Guy race here in 1986, after he tired of organising the Wolverhampton Marathon. Initially, it was just a cross-country run with 108 competitors; but every year, Wilson added more obstacles. At first they were just hay bales, and &quot;a couple of boards leaning together to make a jump&quot;. Then, Wilson says, his imagination went into overdrive: he started building huge permanent structures, obstacles that involved scrambling under and over barbed wire, running through fire or wires that deliver electric shocks. &quot;That became the challenge to the competitors: I&apos;m going to beat you,&quot; he says. &quot;You&apos;ve come this year and you&apos;ve conquered the Tough Guy, but next year I&apos;m going to build an obstacle and it&apos;s going to defeat you. They loved it.&quot; The race slowly grew, becoming biannual: Tough Guy takes place in January, Nettle Warrior at the end of July. Local news crews started turning up, as local news crews are wont to do when grown men start paying good money to fling themselves into barbed wire and run through fire. Their interest was further piqued following the deaths of two participants, one in 2007, the other in 2000 \u2013 the same year Wilson decided to introduce the concept of &quot;Jesus Warriors&quot; (elite competitors who run the course carrying 40kg wooden crucifixes).     Jesus Warriors, elite competitors who run the course carrying 40kg wooden crucifixes. Photograph: Espen Rasmussen/Panos Pictures    Then, about three years ago, something strange happened: companies such as Tough Mudder and Warrior Dash began aggressively marketing endurance obstacle racing across Europe and America. It caught on with a speed that seems to have startled even them: &quot;This is 100 times bigger than we ever thought,&quot; Tough Mudder&apos;s CEO Will Dean said last year. In 2012, 1.5 million people competed in endurance obstacle races in the US alone; the combined revenue of the three biggest race organisers was estimated at $150m. The sport is also taking off in Australia, South Africa, South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Singapore. People around the globe \u2013 well, men, mostly \u2013 developed an insatiable desire to wade through mud pits and fling themselves into ice-cold water, and chivvied along by the kind of relentlessly macho goading you find on the race organisers&apos; website. (Sample encouragement: &quot;Road running will give you about as much upper body strength as Keira Knightley&quot;; &quot;It ain&apos;t about how hard you hit but how hard you can get hit.&quot;) There are those who would argue that there is something faintly embarrassing about the whole business. Are we looking at a physical demonstration of masculinity in crisis, a terrible sporting equivalent of a Chuck Norris DVD marathon \u2013 or, else, not really a sport at all? &quot;I think\u00a0what I class as running purists would probably be a little sniffy about it,&quot; says Andy Dixon, the editor of Runner&apos;s World, a magazine that covers Tough Guy nonetheless. &quot;They would probably think these are like adult school sports day-style events, for people who want to go &apos;Raarh!&apos; and feel like they&apos;re Rambo.&quot; But in April, a 28-year-old man drowned during a\u00a0Tough Mudder event in West Virginia, just over a\u00a0month after another man collapsed and died while competing in an Extreme Rampage race in Kentucky. In 2011, two men died after running in a\u00a0Warrior Dash event in Kansas City. Even those who master the races tend not to emerge unscathed. &quot;The first time I won Tough Guy, I was hypothermic by the end,&quot; says James Appleton, a\u00a0photographer from Cambridge, who has now won the race three times. &quot;I was out of action for three hours afterwards,&quot; he says of that first win, &quot;in the first-aid station being warmed up, completely useless. I had no strength, no energy, I was barely able to get myself warm with the help\u00a0of paramedics. I&apos;ve felt my leg bone nearly\u00a0break, I&apos;ve had things dislocated, been shredded by the ice and the barbed wire. You get to the end broken.&quot; In January, there was another near-fatality during Tough Guy: a competitor was knocked out and nearly drowned before stewards rescued him. &quot;The Lord was with me, the Lord was with us,&quot; Wilson tells me, driving us out on to the course to see where it happened: an underground obstacle filled with mud called the Vietcong Torture Chamber Tunnels. Even so, Wilson is bullish on the subject of safety. &quot;I have perfected it inasmuch as, if somebody is going to get seriously injured or killed, they&apos;ve got to be suicidal \u2013 they&apos;re going to have to use our obstacles for suicide. It&apos;s impossible.&quot; The deaths in America, he says angrily, are down to &quot;neglect and greed&quot; on the part of organisers: &quot;Greed causes serious accidents and serious deaths.&quot; Wilson is not as delighted about the surge in popularity of his idea as you might expect. Two years ago he and Tough Mudder&apos;s Will Dean reached a settlement after years of legal wrangling. This is a long and depressing saga that takes in much mutual public mud-slinging, but at its root is the accusation that Dean ripped off Wilson&apos;s idea, his obstacles and his slogans after visiting South Perton Farm in 2008; Tough Mudder&apos;s launch website featured photographs and video taken at a Tough Guy event. The legal settlement was confidential but, according to court documents, Tough Mudder paid out $725,000. Wilson says he has no plans to create Tough Guy franchises outside the UK, although he has other expansion plans. He talks about setting up a\u00a0Tough Guy competition for children, and about involving disabled contestants. He wants to attract more women, who currently make up only 10% of the entrants, &quot;because women are much more capable than men. They smile all the way. The men pull their faces, they scream, they shout, they&apos;re cowards, they&apos;re self-pitying. Women just enjoy it.&quot; He also wants more over-70s: he claims to have developed a series of what he describes as &quot;magnificent exercises&quot; for pensioners, which among their manifold benefits include an effect on wrinkles he compares to Botox. &quot;They could look like me,&quot; he enthuses. &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t look like someone&apos;s been chopping wood on my face, do I?&quot;     The Tough Guy obstacle race at South Perton Farm, Staffordshire. Photograph: Espen Rasmussen/Panos Pictures    The question of why endurance obstacle racing has developed such a huge appeal is an intriguing one. One theory is that it appeals to those who are no longer satisfied by road running or marathons, but winner James Appleton isn&apos;t sure. Only about 20% of the 5,000 entrants, he estimates, have even seriously trained. It&apos;s mostly &quot;guys who might occasionally play five-a-side football with their mates. They&apos;re just there for an experience. You see a group of them dressed up like cavemen, carrying clubs, or wearing suits. They&apos;ve got this &apos;Let&apos;s have a fun day out&apos; attitude to them.&quot; He agrees with another competitor, who told him that he thought the races&apos; popularity had something to do with &quot;the Facebook generation&quot;. &quot;These days, people have a real desire to express themselves over the internet. They create a\u00a0character for themselves online, almost like a PR campaign: they do things, stick the photos online, they&apos;re saying, &apos;This is who I am.&apos; The photos from Tough Guy are visually exciting: people covered in mud, running through fire, spitting mud out of their mouths. They can put them online and go, &apos;Look at me doing this, aren&apos;t I a sportsman?&apos; People are always thinking about how they appear, and this is a very good way of making themselves look like hardcore soldier-type athletes, when at the end of the day, with a couple of weeks&apos; running just to break their legs in, anyone could do it.&quot; There are other theories. Robert Twigger, author of Being A Man (In The Lousy Modern World), talks about men who are desperate to prove they&apos;re men in &quot;a culture that constantly tells us the differences between men and women are less important than the similarities&quot;. &quot;You might feel you have to define your difference and go out and do something hyper-masculine, a bit ridiculously masculine, really,&quot; he says. Twigger thinks the apparent wildness of the race is another part of the appeal. &quot;Even if you do something like rugby, which is perceived to be a tough sport, there are all these rules and regulations. And we&apos;ve got enough of those in our lives. We&apos;ve created a culture where we think everything is rule-bound, where you don&apos;t do things because you imagine all the red tape involved. Here&apos;s a chance to do something that appears to be without all those rules.&quot; &quot;At the very basic biological level, races like\u00a0this\u00a0do release neurotransmitters and hormones that give a natural high,&quot; says George Karseras, a chartered occupational and sports therapist at consultancy the Leap Partnership. &quot;It&apos;s about feeling alive. You don&apos;t get the sense of feeling alive so much as when you confront something life-threatening. You&apos;re out of your thought processes, you&apos;re out of your mind. It&apos;s a switch-off mechanism, an extreme one. People doing these races aren&apos;t thinking, &apos;Oh, how&apos;s my job\u00a0going?&apos; These days, because of mobile phones\u00a0and the internet, we&apos;re never really away from work. We need something extreme to overcome this extreme stimulation we&apos;re used to.&quot; The latter is a theory with which Billy Wilson would agree, albeit in his own inimitable style. &quot;We take you to the very edge of your endurance, we strip you of all your energy, you go into delirium,&quot; he says. &quot;And when you go into delirium, you reach that space between life and death. And in that space, your whole life passes before you in seconds, and the future comes to you. A\u00a0million thoughts hit you \u2013 you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening. You&apos;re in such a state, so terrible that you don&apos;t ever want to come to Tough Guy again. Then, a week or two later, everybody comes back with the same words. &apos;It was a life-changing experience. I&apos;m now a new person. I&apos;m now looking at life in a different way. I&apos;m now going to start doing something for everyone else instead of being so selfish. I&apos;m now going to be better at my job. I&apos;m now going to be not so snappy and nasty to the secretary or my wife or whatever.&apos; They want to come back and do it again, because they&apos;ve had such a fantastic experience!&quot; Enthused, he starts telling me about another of his plans. He wants the government to set up 100 Tough Guy-style &quot;forest gyms&quot; within inner-city boundaries, as a way both of commemorating the centenary of the first world war and &quot;resolving the obesity crisis&quot;. He fixes me with a stare and lowers his voice. &quot;Now you understand,&quot; he says, &quot;why I believe I can change the world.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jul/19/indonesia-forest-fires-smog-crisis", "sentences": ["Three weeks ago, a noxious haze engulfed Singapore and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, breaking air pollution records.", "Malaysia closed schools, Singapore advised residents to stay indoors and distributed free face masks to the poor, and Indonesia evacuated some villages in the worst affected areas.", "Singapore tabled a proposal calling on the other governments to publicly disclose company land leases, supporting accountability when monitoring future fires.", "Day-to-day monitoring of the smog levels and fire locations, published on websites with large local audiences in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and reinforced in daily media coverage, has significantly shifted the tone of government discourse.", "Betraying their tradition of non-intervention in their neighbours&apos; affairs, Singapore and Malaysia have loudly and repeatedly pressed Indonesia to act, while also offering assistance.", "In a truly precedent-setting move, Singapore has also threatened to prosecute any companies linked with illegal burning that have corporate connections to Singapore.", "This is highly significant since some of the large holding companies that control the Indonesian industry, including the world&apos;s largest palm oil trading company, Wilmar, and pulp and paper giant RGE, are headquartered in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-19T16:25:46Z", "title": "How the eyes in the sky are keeping a check on forest fires", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "Trees and forests", "Wildfires", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "World news", "Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "Singapore", "Malaysia", "Nasa", "Satellites"], "article": "Three weeks ago, a noxious haze engulfed Singapore and parts of Malaysia and Indonesia, breaking air pollution records. Malaysia closed schools, Singapore advised residents to stay indoors and distributed free face masks to the poor, and Indonesia evacuated some villages in the worst affected areas. The suffocating smog emanated from forest fires on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. This week, environment ministers from across southeast Asia gathered for a summit in Malaysia under intense public pressure to take action and prevent a repeat of the smog. Singapore tabled a proposal calling on the other governments to publicly disclose company land leases, supporting accountability when monitoring future fires. The governments announced that they would share the company lease data among themselves, but stopped short of making it publicly available. This is mixed news at best. New technology has given us an unprecedented ability to understand and solve the problem of haze and fires, but further efforts are needed to ensure this vital data on company land leases is accurate and made public. Media coverage and the public outcry over the fires have been strengthened by the ability to monitor exactly where fires were burning in real time. Various groups used freely availably satellite data from Nasa and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), to map and share information about the fires each day. The World Resources Institute (WRI) used this information to quickly publish maps showing where the fires were burning, and which companies were potentially responsible based on concession data from the Indonesian government. Other groups confirmed the analysis, turning the media spotlight and the eyes of government investigators onto the companies and their possible responsibility for the fires. WRI&apos;s analysis of the Nasa fire data showed that half of the fires were likely burning on land managed by companies, including some that supply the palm oil that ends up in a bewildering array of supermarket products from shampoo to cosmetics, and from ice cream to soap. In recent years, retail behemoths like Walmart, Tesco, and Marks &amp; Spencer, and their suppliers \u2013 global consumer goods giants including Unilever and Nestl\u00e9 \u2013 have made significant efforts to encourage palm oil producers to behave responsibly. This incident was the major test of these new policies and reaction was swift. As soon as data was published showing which palm oil growers were implicated in the Sumatra fires, several global consumer brands contacted suppliers for clarifications, with the implicit threat that purchases could be suspended. The speed and public nature of these actions signal a dramatic new way of doing business. In the past, it might have taken months or even years of campaigns by well-organised pressure groups like Greenpeace to bring about such changes. Now, with real-time information, media coverage and a well-informed citizenry, together with the new sustainable sourcing policies of the big firms, action is being taken within hours of bad practice being detected. Governments are also under growing pressure to take action. For over a decade, Indonesia has refused to ratify a key regional agreement on trans-boundary haze pollution and has not taken steps to address the root causes of fires, which include entrenched conflicts of land between companies and communities. Indonesia is the only country in the region that has not ratified the agreement, and also the country with the greatest incidence of haze and smog-producing blazes. Indonesian environment officials this week vowed to push for ratification, though this is a decision that can be made only by the Indonesian parliament, which has repeatedly rejected such a move. Day-to-day monitoring of the smog levels and fire locations, published on websites with large local audiences in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and reinforced in daily media coverage, has significantly shifted the tone of government discourse. Betraying their tradition of non-intervention in their neighbours&apos; affairs, Singapore and Malaysia have loudly and repeatedly pressed Indonesia to act, while also offering assistance. In a truly precedent-setting move, Singapore has also threatened to prosecute any companies linked with illegal burning that have corporate connections to Singapore. This is highly significant since some of the large holding companies that control the Indonesian industry, including the world&apos;s largest palm oil trading company, Wilmar, and pulp and paper giant RGE, are headquartered in Singapore. More significantly, top reformers in the Indonesian government have been demanding that companies publicly release information about land holdings. They are also seeking greater transparency in the structure of the various conglomerates, holding companies and hundreds of subsidiaries that control the palm oil, logging, and pulp and paper industries. The contradictory move by other Indonesian officials attending the haze summit this week to share company land lease maps, but only with other governments, is a serious obstacle to progress. Unless the governments elect to make company land lease data public, companies committed to sustainable sourcing of palm oil and other products cannot reinforce the efforts of governments and others with market pressure. Without the maps, the media and concerned citizens cannot easily monitor government efforts and help ensure those responsible for illegal fires are held accountable. New technology and the transparency and public disclosure opportunities it creates are not going to solve the southeast Asian fires problem, or many other environmental and humanitarian issues alone. But they might enable more public awareness, outrage and demands for action to tip the balance and force more companies and governments to act. It&apos;s not surprising that some government officials are seeking to maintain secrecy, but it seems only a matter of time before real-time monitoring by citizens, journalists, markets and enforcement agencies becomes the norm. \u2022 Dr Nigel Sizer leads the forests team at the World Resources Institute, an environment and development research institution.

But their rooms lack mini-bars. That&apos;s because Landgut Borsig is (almost) a zero-carbon hotel. &quot;We produce our energy ourselves,&quot; owner and manager Michael Stober explains. &quot;We actually produce more energy than we need. We&apos;ve bought the forest surrounding the hotel as well, and it absorbs nearly all our emissions. We&apos;re adding more trees now to make us completely CO2-neutral.&quot; Sound more flower power than business? Think again. &quot;Zero-carbon hotels have become a big trend in the past 10 years,&quot; reports Willy Legrand, who teaches hotel management at the International University of Applied Sciences, Bad Honnef-Bonn. &quot;Now there are even plus-carbon hotels, which sell their surplus to others.&quot; According to Legrand, co-author of Sustainability in the Hospitality Industry, the main reason is skyrocketing energy costs: in many countries, energy is now hotels&apos; largest expense, second only to staff. In a survey conducted by Legrand, 74% of hotels reported investing in energy savings to reduce costs. &quot;When I started, I had no idea whether this would take off&quot;, admits Michaela Reitterer, owner and manager of Vienna&apos;s Hotel Stadthalle, the world&apos;s first CO2-neutral city hotel when it opened in 2008. &quot;But I&apos;m convinced CO2 neutrality is good business. This is a way of differentiating yourself, and it&apos;s good PR. If I just ran an ordinary three-star hotel, you&apos;d never have called me.&quot; Hotel chains discovered sustainability as a selling point long ago. Many display signs in their bathrooms inviting guests to help preserve the environment by keeping their towels for more than one day. &quot;But the big chains are not serious about sustainability&quot;, claims Frank Naumann, whose company, Dibella, supplies hotels with organic bed linen and towels, made from organic cotton and manufactured by adult workers who are paid proper wages. &quot;Keeping your towels a day longer is not going to make a big difference, but the big chains are not willing to pay more for organic textiles.&quot; Instead it&apos;s boutique hotels like the Stadthalle that are driving the new zero-carbon, super-sustainability trend. Among the standard offerings: organic bedsheets and towels, toilets that only use rain water, and food items with labels that trace ingredients back to a specific field. Some, like Landgut Borsig, even feature mattresses made from natural ingredients such as cocoa fibre, natural rubber and horsehair. &quot;We supply and purify our own water, we use solar panels, solar cells and thermal heat, and serve smaller portions so as to reduce food waste&quot;, reports Anders T\u00f6rnroth, sales director at Sweden&apos;s zero-carbon S\u00e5nga-S\u00e4by hotel and conference centre. &quot;And we offset our guests&apos; and employees&apos; CO2 emissions getting here.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s no doubt that current best practices are in small hotels,&quot; explains Legrand, who also teaches at universities in Singapore and the Middle East. &quot;That&apos;s because boutique hotels are often operated by their owners and reflect their owners&apos; personality. Of course, they don&apos;t have the global impact that similar practices in large chains would have.&quot; Though they don&apos;t go as far as zero carbon, several chains, including InterContinental, Ritz-Carlton and Hyatt, do have serious sustainability programs. &quot;My wife and I run the hotel because it&apos;s our passion and yes, it&apos;s more expensive,&quot; explains Stober, who opened his hotel last year. &quot;But we get guests who are willing to pay more, and are on track to becoming profitable by next year. Just the other day, the largest companies on the German stock exchange hosted a sustainability conference here.&quot; S\u00e5nga-S\u00e4by, says T\u00f6rnroth, breaks even thanks to corporate guests &quot;who choose us to ease their environmental conscience&quot;. At the 80-room Hotel Stadthalle, Michaela Reitterer reports an average occupancy rate of 83%. &quot;It&apos;s not just about being CO2-neutral,&quot; she explains. &quot;It&apos;s about the whole concept, and as owner you have to be willing to pay a bit more for some things. And the guests appreciate that. Sure, there are some people who don&apos;t come back because we don&apos;t have minibars or air conditioning, but most people are fine with that.&quot; Besides, Reitterer points out, the EU&apos;s 20-20-20 binding climate change policy leaves EU businesses no choice but to cut carbon emissions. Because traditional banks are often reluctant to give loans to businesses seen as more granola than profit machines, &quot;sustainability banks&quot; have entered the market. Netherlands-based Triodos Bank is now a leader in lending to super-sustainable hotels. The zero-carbon Hotel Saunders Group on the US east coast, for its part, reports saving millions on energy and other initiatives such as waterless urinals. Last year S\u00e5nga-S\u00e4by saw a 1.6% revenue increase; during the same time, the Swedish hotel industry shrank. &quot;There&apos;s so much environmental consciousness nowadays,&quot; notes T\u00f6rnroth. &quot;We even get international guests who come here specifically because of our profile. Everything is pointing in the direction of serious sustainability.&quot; Still, Legrand points out, there&apos;s no such thing as a 100% sustainable hotel. &quot;But judging from my students, this trend will keep taking off,&quot; he predicts. &quot;They take sustainability for granted. You don&apos;t even have to explain to them how a photovoltaic panel works.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Recent breakthroughs have been credited with forcing down the cost of desalinated water from $1 per cubic metre to between $0.80 and $0.50 over five years. New ceramic membranes are helping to make treatment more affordable. &quot;Membrane technology is increasingly important because system integrity, longevity and costs have improved,&quot; explains Paul Street, business development director for engineering firm Black &amp; Veatch. Seawater desalination: Although holding much promise for the future, seawater desalination is still extremely expensive, with reverse osmosis technology consuming a vast amount of energy: around 4 kilowatt hours of energy for every cubic metre of water. One solution being explored in Singapore, which opened its first seawater desalination plant in 2005, is biomimicry - mimicking the biological processes by which mangrove plants and euryhaline fish (fish that can live in fresh briny or salt water) extract seawater using minimal energy. Another new approach is to use biomimetic membranes enhanced with aquaporin: proteins embedded in cell membranes that selectively shuttle water in and out of cells while blocking out salts. Harry Seah, chief technology officer for PUB, Singapore&apos;s national water agency, says: &quot;If science can find a way of effectively mimicking these biological processes, innovative engineering solutions can potentially be derived for seawater desalination. Seawater desalination can then be transformed beyond our wildest imagination.&quot; Smart monitoring: In developing countries alone, it is estimated that 45m cubic metres are lost every day in distribution networks. Leaks are not only costly for companies, but increase pressure on stretched water resources and raise the likelihood of pollutants infiltrating supplies. &quot;It does not make commercial sense to invest billions in additional reservoirs and water catchment, treatment plants [and] pumping stations, when as much as 60% of water produced is unaccounted for,&quot; says Dale Hartley, director of business development at SebaKMT, a water leak detection specialist. New monitoring technologies help companies to ensure the integrity of their vast water supply networks. Electronic instruments, such as pressure and acoustic sensors, connected wirelessly in real time to centralised and cloud-based monitoring systems will allow companies to detect and pinpoint leaks much quicker.

Applying a more intelligent approach to water management by deploying precision irrigation systems and computer algorithms and modelling is already beginning to bring benefits to farmers in developed countries. However, while this approach embraces new instrumentation and analytical technologies, innovation comes from a change in mindset that emphasises the importance of measuring and forecasting. &quot;In the old days there was not so much stress on measuring because we thought we had plenty of water,&quot; says Carey Hidaka, smarter water management expert at IBM. &quot;It&apos;s a bit of a paradigm switch for the water industry, which like others is used to throwing new engineering developments at problems.&quot; Wastewater processing: Engineering still has its place, however. Many people living in urban areas, even in advanced economies, still do not have their sewage adequately treated and wastewater is often discharged, untreated, into rivers and estuaries or used as irrigation water. New technologies are promising to transform wastewater into a resource for energy generation and a source of drinking water. Modular hybrid activated sludge digesters, for instance, are now removing nutrients to be used as fertilisers and are, in turn, driving down the energy required for treatment by up to half. &quot;There is an urgent need for wastewater systems that are more compact, so that new plants can be built in urban areas where land is scarce and for upgrading and expanding extant facilities,&quot; says Dr David Lloyd Owen, an advisor to the board of Bluewater Bio, a specialist in wastewater treatment.

Photograph: Bluewater Bio    Mobile recycling facilities: An unexpected by product from the explosion of the global hydraulic fracturing industry has been demand for highly mobile water treatment facilities. Investment is being channelled into reverse osmosis units that will allow companies to treat high volumes of water to extract gas and injected into the subsurface. &quot;There will be knock-on benefits as products [will be developed] with new applications where the price tolerance is much lower,&quot; says Peter Adriaens, professor of environmental engineering and entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan. Adriaens adds: &quot;As these technologies develop and learn to treat high volumes of water, we will see cheaper, more potable treatment systems and we will start to move away from massive centralised treatment systems.&quot; Where will we see other technological innovations?

No religion \u2013 Islam, Christianity or any other \u2013 can be the basis for democratic government. Religions are based on faith; government has to be based on reason. Islam and Christianity are authoritarian and sectarian; they divide, they do not unite. This does not mean individual Muslims or Christians cannot group together through political parties with common aims to form democratic governments but they will only work within constitutions that provide for human rights as contained in the secular Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Islamist attempts to impose sharia law and Christian fundamentalist attempts to impose their dogma must be resisted; there has to be freedom from religion as well as freedom of religion. Democratic government has to come from a consensus of all a nation&apos;s citizens, men and women of all faiths and of no faith. This does not mean &apos;majoritarianism&apos;, the rule of the majority over the rest; minority and individual rights have to be protected and respected for all a nation&apos;s citizens. A truly democratic nation requires a balance between individual rights and societal needs, with freedom of speech an essential factor, including the right to denigrate, to shock and to offend any ideas, political or religious, so long as they do not preach hatred or violence. If democracy is to work in Egypt, the Islamist-drafted constitution must be revised to include the foregoing tenets.Cy ChadleyEscondido, California, US \u2022 I was shocked by your front-page headline and for that matter I thought Jonathan Freedland&apos;s accompanying article fell below the standard of analysis I have learnt to expect from him. It has taken hundreds of years for Britain to evolve from the feudal system to a form of constitutional monarchy. During this time we have ceased burning witches, having public executions or having the death penalty. We are developing justice \u2013 in which democracy is mixed with hierarchy \u2013 still more readily accessible to the rich than the poor. Rather gradually we have attained education for all. We have a National Health Service. Over the centuries we have fought for universal suffrage \u2013 but we could still learn from Turkey when it comes to the equality of women. There have been wars, massacres; passionate debate to rid ourselves of slavery. Just as Freedland tells us that the US provides the Egyptian military with $1.3bn, we have a government that, proud of its work this year in generating an arms trade treaty, now boasts of a glamorous September arms fair in London to which all are invited to buy weapons. Would we do anything for money? People in Northern lreland still enjoy killing each other. There is a long way to go, it will take decades; we are still striving.Alec GainesEdinburgh, UK \u2022 I am not clear what you mean by &quot;political&quot; and &quot;Islam&quot;. Any system of government is politics and in most Islamic countries, from Indonesia to Saudi Arabia, it works. I suspect Freedland means democratic politics. This is held up as bring the zenith of political evolution. If the US is its greatest example then God help us. In almost every way, America is a disaster. And yes democratic Islam does work in a number of states including Indonesia and Malaysia. Many Islamic states are autocracies but so were many European states a century ago. What does that prove?George MalyniczChelmsford, UK \u2022 The problem with religious democracies, be they Christian, Islamist, capitalist or communist, is that there is a prior idea \u2013 God, money or class- which trumps human rights. A functional democracy is secular and requires an inviolate constitution, one you cannot go behind, to protect the rights of the minority. Otherwise, there will be repression and corruption on the one hand and revolt on the other. This was the gift to the world of those who drafted the constitution of the United States in the 1780s.Robert ThalerNew Hamburg, Ontario, Canada \u2022 Considering political Christianity didn&apos;t exactly promote universal contentment back in the good old medieval days, I am not holding my breath.Robin HornbyCalgary, Alberta, Canada \u2022 &quot;Can political Islam ever work?&quot; brought to mind Jesus&apos;s Sermon on the Mount, concerning hypocrites, eyes, motes and beams. I look forward to the GW headline &quot;Can capitalist democracy ever work?&quot;Colin RoyleOutremont, Quebec, Canada Sympathy for Snowden I take Peter Beaumont&apos;s point that it is not ideal for transparency advocates like Edward Snowden to praise the record of countries like Russia and leaders like Putin (Snowden wrong to embrace Putin, 19 July). But to be consistent, he surely must also condemn those ransom hostages who convert to Islam and criticise the west in order to escape. Also in the same situation were the US servicemen captured by North Koreans and Chinese back in the day, who consented to being filmed condemning US imperialism in order to escape. Snowden is doing the same. He will be looking around his corridor in the airport, wondering whether his life might be all downhill from here. Although his is not being tortured (yet), nevertheless I forgive him and wish him all the best.S W DaveyTorrens, ACT, Australia Remember the Monroe Doctrine? The Monroe Doctrine of 1823 repudiated interference in the Americas by outside &quot;imperialists&quot; (When will they ever learn?, 12 July). Unfortunately, the US has overlooked the possibility that this principle might apply to the other Americas. One example will suffice to illustrate this, namely, the US&apos;s undermining of the democratically elected government of Chile in 1973. US citizens should ask themselves why they fought their war of independence, and if the answer might also apply to the other Americas.Derek WilliamsDonvale, Victoria, Australia Portugal&apos;s people problem The fall in the birthrate in European countries, which may lead to the populations of some falling, is often described as though it is a disaster, and this is what Anthony Faiola&apos;s article on Portugal does (Portugal suffers as birthrate plummets, 5\u00a0July). The problem is that there will be a growing percentage of elderly people to be supported by a young working population, according to this line of reasoning. Portugal has an unemployment rate of 18%. Most other European countries suffer from high unemployment rates, particularly among young people. As long as this continues, not only will the young unemployed be in no position to support the elderly financially, but they will need support themselves. Trying to encourage people to have more children will only make things worse. A fall in population should be grasped as an opportunity: it is a chance to counter urban sprawl, cut the production of greenhouse gases by reducing demand for road vehicles and consumer goods whose production pollutes air and land, ease the problem of responding to the threat of rising sea levels, ensure adequate water supplies, and protect the natural environment. If a labour shortage eventually results, it may also allow workers to press for improved wages and secure a redistribution of wealth, in a system in which the few prosper at the expense of the many when there is a plentiful supply of labour. In short, many of the ills of the modern world might be countered more effectively with a falling population than one that is growing and putting an ever-increasing strain on the environment.John GeeSingapore Briefly \u2022 Over half of the &quot;37 thoughts on turning 37&quot; (12 July) that Sophie Heawood listed were summed up by Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore 100 years ago when he turned 50: &quot;Youth is a horse and maturity a charioteer.&quot; Indeed, Heawood herself uses a similar metaphor when she advises us to &quot;stop blaming&quot; our parents and says, &quot;You&apos;re a planet now, not a satellite.&quot;Richard OrlandoMontreal, Canada \u2022 Surely it&apos;s no surprise that the wine &quot;experts&quot; cannot tell good wine from bad (July 5).

Among the 13 galas and 52 special presentations revealed is The Fifth Estate, the drama based partly on the book about WikiLeaks by Guardian journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding, which will open this year&apos;s festival. The drama, directed by Bill Condon, stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange with Daniel Br\u00fchl, David Thewlis, Stanley Tucci, Laura Linney and Dan Stevens in supporting roles. Peter Capaldi plays the Guardian&apos;s editor, Alan Rusbridger.            The film is one of three world premieres starring Cumberbatch at the festival, which runs from 5 - 15 September. The others are both Weinstein Company productions. Firstly, August: Osage County, an adaptation of Tracy (Killer Joe) Letts&apos; Pulitzer prize-winning play, co-starring Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts and Ewan McGregor. And secondly, 12 Years a Slave, Steve McQueen&apos;s followup to Shame, with Chiwetel Ejiofor as a real-life free man kidnapped in 1841 and sold into slavery in Louisiana. Cumberbatch is the plantation owner who buys him; Michael Fassbender and Brad Pitt co-star. Ejiofor also takes the lead in Half of a Yellow Sun, based on the Nigeria-set novel by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.      Idris Elba as Nelson Mandela in Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom    Other key contenders getting their first airing in Canada include the Weinsteins&apos; Nelson Mandela biopic, A Long Walk to Freedom, starring Idris Elba and Crash director Paul Haggis&apos;s Third Person, an ensemble love story with Liam Neeson, Maria Bello, James Franco and Mila Kunis.  Kate Winslet makes a return to the spotlight with Labor Day, an adaptation by Jason Reitman of the Joyce Maynard bestseller about a depressed single mother who takes in a convict (played by Josh Brolin). James Van Der Beek and Tobey Maguire co-star.  Keira Knightley also takes on her first lead since last autumn with Can A Song Save Your Life? a drama from Once&apos;s John Carney about the romance between a dejected music executive (Mark Ruffalo) and a young singer-songwriter (Knightley) in New York. Catherine Keener, Yasiin Bey (aka Mos Def), Adam Levine, CeeLo Green and James Corden have supporting roles.  Cordon takes the lead in One Chance, about the rise of Britain&apos;s Got Talent star Paul Potts, which was presented as part of the Weinstein&apos;s showreel at Cannes, and is also being spoken of as an awards contender. Julie Walters plays his mum. Yasiin Bey, meanwhile, can also be seen in the closing night film, Life of Crime, an Elmore Leonard adaptation co-staring Isla Fisher and Jennifer Aniston.      Jesse Eisenberg in a still from Richard Ayoade's The Double    Toronto has traditionally been a popular premiere destination for British directors; Richard Ayoade&apos;s Submarine premiered at the festival three years ago, and his new film, The Double, looks set to be one of the most eagerly-anticipated titles. A loose adaptation of the Dostoyevsky novel of the same name, it stars Jesse Eisenberg, Mia Wasikowska and Submarine&apos;s Noah Taylor, and concerns a man driven to insanity by his doppelganger. The Invisible Woman, Ralph Fiennes&apos; take on the Claire Tomalin biography of Charles Dickens&apos;s lover, Nelly Ternan, also opens in Toronto. Fiennes directs and stars, Felicity Jones is Nelly, Kristin Scott Thomas her mother and Tom Hollander plays Wilkie Collins.  Roger Michell showed Hyde Park on Hudson at the festival last year, this year he&apos;s back with Le Weekend, about a married couple (Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan) who attempt to rekindle their marriage in Paris. David Mackenzie&apos;s Starred Up is about a violent teen (Jack O&apos;Connell) transferred to prison where he meets his father. Toronto also sees the return of Amma Asante, the British director behind the Bafta-winning Way of Life. Belle is about Dido Elizabeth Belle, the daughter of a British admiral and a slave; Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson are the couple who raise her. Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars as Belle herself. Then there&apos;s All Is By My Side, the long-awaited Jimi Hendrix biopic that stars Outkast musician Andre &quot;3000&quot; Benjamin as the legendary guitarist. It&apos;s written and directed by John Ridley, the writer of David O Russell&apos;s Three Kings. Tom Dunlea and Oliver Bennett play the other two-thirds of The Jimi Hendrix Experience - drummer Mitch Mitchell and bass player Noel Redding. Skeletons star Andrew Buckley is their manager, Chas Chandler, while Hayley Atwell will play Hendrix&apos;s long-term girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham.  Other titles confirmed today include Dallas Buyers Club, the true-life tale of an HIV-sufferer&apos;s battles with the medical establishment in 1980s Texas. The shoot was the cause of Matthew McConaughey&apos;s dramatic weight loss last year; he takes the lead with Jennifer Garner as his doctor. Tiff-favourite Atom Egoyan&apos;s dramatisation of the case of the West Memphis Three, Devil&apos;s Knot, stars Reese Witherspoon as the mother of one of the murdered boys and Colin Firth as a private investigator      Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman at The Railway Man photocall in Edinburgh Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA    Firth also stars in The Railway Man, based on the autobiography of Eric Lomax, a British officer sent to a prisoner of war camp in Singapore where he worked on the Thai-Burma railway. Stellan Skarsgard plays his best friend, Nicole Kidman his wife; Jeremy Irvine the young Lomax.  One of James Gandolfini&apos;s final films also has its world premiere. Enough Said, from director Nicole Holofcener, pairs Gandolfini with newly-divorced Julia-Louis Dreyfus. Holofcener regular Catherine Keener co-stars as Gandolfini&apos;s ex-wife.  The Toronto film festival has increasingly been seen as the launchpad of choice for Academy award hopefuls, and its one major award \u2013\u00a0voted for by audiences \u2013\u00a0has been seen as a prize to bag en route to Oscar success. Last year, David O Russell&apos;s Silver Linings Playbook took top honours (with Ben Affleck&apos;s Argo as runner-up); previous recipients have included Slumdog Millionaire and The King&apos;s Speech.  Toronto kicks off just as the Venice film festival \u2013\u00a0which starts at the end of August \u2013\u00a0begins to wind up. Many of Venice&apos;s big premieres travel to Toronto having debuted in Italy, and though few Venice titles have so far been announced, those Toronto titles billed as North American premieres look likely to have first screened in Europe a few days before.  Last year, such films included The Master, To the Wonder and Spring Breakers; this year Lido launches look likely for Jonathan Glazer&apos;s Under the Skin, an adaptation of the acclaimed Michel Faber novel with Scarlett Johansson as an alien in human form gobbling her way around the Highlands; Man of Tai Chi, the directorial debut of Keanu Reeves; a new biopic of Mary Queen of Scots with Saoirse Ronan, and Night Moves, the latest film from Kelly (Meek&apos;s Cutoff) Reichardt.  Gravity, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n&apos;s space thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, has already been named opening night film at Venice; it then travels to Toronto. Odds are on that Stephen Frears&apos;s Philomena, with Judi Dench and Steve Coogan, will follow suit, likewise David Gordon Green&apos;s Joe, Rush, Ron Howard&apos;s motor-racing drama and Parkland, a drama set around the assassination of JFK with Paul Giamatti and Zac Efron.           Choice titles from Cannes such as Blue is the Warmest Colour, The Past, The Great Beauty are also set for North American premieres at Toronto. And a smattering of other festival favourites such as Gloria (from Berlin) and Kill Your Darlings (Sundance) will be screened. Bad Words, the directorial debut of Jason Bateman \u2013\u00a0about a spelling bee loser who attempts to win as an adult \u2013\u00a0also has its world premiere, likewise Supermensch, a documentary about talent agent Shep Gordon directed by first-timer Mike Myers.  Other comedies at the festival include Hateship Loveship about a teenage girl (Hailee Steinfeld) who orchestrates a romance between her nanny (Kristen Wiig) and her recovering addict father (Guy Pearce) and The Love Punch, with Pierce Brosnan and Emma Thompson as a divorced couple looking to recoup stolen retirement funds. One of the key men behind Mad Men, Matthew Weiner, presents You Are Here about a road trip to bag inheritance money, co-starring Owen Wilson and Zach Galifianakis.     Oprah Winfrey in The Butler    Key Academy awards contenders not accounted for include Martin Scorsese&apos;s The Wolf of Wall Street, Lee Daniels&apos; The Butler, Bennett Miller&apos;s Foxcatcher, Nicole Kidman-starrer Grace of Monaco, David O Russell&apos;s American Hustle, George Clooney&apos;s The Monuments Men and Susanne Bier&apos;s Serena. Two Tom Hanks hopefuls \u2013\u00a0Captain Phillips and Saving Mr Banks \u2013\u00a0are hot favourites for late announcements, likewise Ridley Scott&apos;s star-studded Cormac McCarthy adaptation The Counselor.

The scientific body cited diseases similar to Sars which has killed 45 out of 82 infected people since it emerged in the Middle East in September 2012. Meanwhile, China is the staging ground for a new strain of &quot;highly pathogenic&quot; bird flu, known as H7N9. It&apos;s unknown how the virus, which has spread from chickens to humans undetected, is transmitted. Dr Gary Fitt, director of CSIRO Biosecurity Flagship, told Guardian Australia that new threats were emerging due to population and trade movement. &quot;When you consider that Sars killed 800 people and spread around the world like lightning, there is a real risk in our increasingly inter-connected world,&quot; he said. &quot;We can better respond to diseases than we used to, but we are all so connected that people should be concerned about the pandemic. There is greater potential for pathways of viruses and pests into Australia as more people move about.&quot; Fitt said the CSIRO was working on new technology and surveillance to ensure these threats did not penetrate Australia. But he warned that large-scale development, such as the mooted plan to turn northern Australia into a &quot;food bowl&quot;, would pose fresh challenges. &quot;We certainly can&apos;t afford to drop our guard,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of people have an interest in developing northern Australia, which is all great, but it will open up biosecurity challenges. We need to think about the consequences of development and avoid problems before they happen, rather than wait to see what happens.&quot; The CSIRO is also working on new ways to eradicate the European carp, an invasive pest in the Murray Darling basin, and prevent any invasion of the Asian tiger mosquito, which is blamed for spreading diseases such as dengue fever. &quot;We are trying to find long-term solutions to reduce the risk of this mosquito getting into Australia,&quot; he said. &quot;It has already been found and stopped at ports here. It&apos;s not just the dengue fever risk \u2013 it&apos;s an incredibly aggressive biter. We really don&apos;t want it here.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/25/reprieve-death-penalty-volunteer-program", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s all well and good if you&apos;re a foreign national but if you&apos;re just another poor bloke from south-east Asia who&apos;s caught up in Singapore or Indonesia then you don&apos;t have QCs from Melbourne or Sydney going over to represent you.", "That same year, 25-year-old Melbourne man, Van Nguyen, was executed in Singapore for drug trafficking."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-25T04:23:10Z", "title": "Reprieve expands death-penalty case volunteer program into south-east Asia", "tags": ["Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Law"], "article": "An Australian anti-death penalty organisation has expanded its volunteer program into south- east Asia, hoping to make a dent in the huge number of cases where people \u2013 including Australians \u2013 are condemned to die by harsh and occasionally flawed legal systems. Reprieve Australia has been sending volunteers \u2013 including lawyers, law students, teachers, even firefighters and pilots \u2013 to the southern states of the US for over 10 years to assist on death penalty cases. The self-funded volunteers have been involved in the exoneration of several prisoners. Volunteers give their time, experience and support to assist local lawyers and families who don&apos;t have access to the money needed in a fight against the death penalty. Duties include investigation, welfare work with families, administration and research, even driving visitors to see the prisoner. In 2012 alone, 679 death sentences were handed down and 38 executions carried out in the Asia-Pacific region, according to Amnesty International. These numbers are nowhere near the official figure, since China executes more of its citizens than the rest of the world put together, but keeps details secret, as do several other nations. Despite noting &quot;positive developments&quot; in the region, Amnesty&apos;s 2012 report found &quot;some individuals were sentenced to death on the basis of evidence extracted through torture and other ill-treatment&quot;. It is because of these injustices that Melbourne-based Reprieve decided to move into the region. The organisation currently has volunteers in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. &quot;It seemed obligatory to us to pursue that work in our region,&quot; Reprieve&apos;s president, Matthew Goldberg, told Guardian Australia. &quot;The US program will still continue because there&apos;s been success there and we want to see the teams that we support continue to be supported \u2013 but there had been that nagging sense of obligation to understand whether there was the same opportunity in our region,&quot; Goldberg said. Melbourne criminal lawyer Sara Da Motta is currently in Thailand, working with a civil liberties organisation on behalf of Reprieve Australia on death penalties handed down to four southern Thai nationals convicted of terrorist attacks related to the country&apos;s intensified insurgency. &quot;[The work] is about publicising some of the issues that have led to that and telling a story that people can relate to with these four people who are now sentenced to death,&quot; Da Motta said. &quot;There&apos;s legislation in place which allows the people to be detained without charge and that also means that a lot of people that are detained under those laws are actually subject to torture and forced conditions.&quot; Da Motta said she has discovered stark differences between the Thai legal system and Australia&apos;s. In Thailand there is no duty of disclosure, which is something we &quot;take for granted. They will not find out about which witnesses the prosecution will call until the day of the trial, for example. The right to know the case against you, that doesn&apos;t really exist here, and it certainly significantly impacts on the sort of preparation they can do before the day.&quot; Inadequate legal representation is common in death penalty cases across the world. Richard Bourke, director of the Louisiana Capital Assistance Centre, which hosts Reprieve volunteers, said people facing the death penalty in the US and also south east Asia were frequently very poor, and a defence was expensive to investigate and mount. &quot;That money has not been available, even with volunteer lawyers for instance agreeing to assist some folks, like foreign nationals,&quot; Bourke said. &quot;It&apos;s all well and good if you&apos;re a foreign national but if you&apos;re just another poor bloke from south-east Asia who&apos;s caught up in Singapore or Indonesia then you don&apos;t have QCs from Melbourne or Sydney going over to represent you. But their lives are as worthy or worthwhile as any British or Australian citizen.&quot; This is where the volunteers like Reprieve members come in. &quot;When you don&apos;t have access to money, what people can give is their commitment, their time and their legal help,&quot; Bourke said. Two Australians remain on death row in south-east Asia. Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are two of the so-called Bali Nine \u2013 the Australians jailed in Indonesia for attempting to smuggle 8.9kg of heroin out of the country in 2005. That same year, 25-year-old Melbourne man, Van Nguyen, was executed in Singapore for drug trafficking. Chan and Sukumaran are currently on death row in Kerobokan prison in Bali. They are among the estimated 130 people who were on death row in Indonesia at the end of 2012. Their case for clemency has a lot of traction, not least because of the Mercy campaign started by members of Reprieve and supported by the two Australians&apos; families and friends. &quot;We&apos;ve been working with Amnesty International Australia to ensure that the Australian government does all that it can to support their application for clemency,&quot; Goldberg said. But most people on death row can&apos;t even hope to rely on international assistance and publicity. Reprieve is aware that the work they undertake is about trying to help people \u2013 not just Australians \u2013 who are on death row, said Australian barrister Julian McMahon, who has worked and continues to work on a number of death penalty cases, including those of Chan and Sukumaran. &quot;Reprieve understands a critical aspect of this which is that this new step they&apos;re taking must have nothing to do with the citizenship of the people they&apos;re trying to help,&quot; he told Guardian Australia. The role of Reprieve, said McMahon, is to work with the locals and to open doors to research, support and ideas, and to empower local lawyers and advocates to argue for the hundreds of people on death row in Asia. He said: &quot;For many years young lawyers on their way to America have often chatted to me about the death penalty and the kind of step that they&apos;re taking and I&apos;ve regularly said to them \u2013 apart from supporting what they do \u2013 &apos;we need people like you working in Asia&apos;, just as much as America needs people working on its own death penalty cases.&quot; Da Motta leaves Thailand at the end of this week. She said her time working on behalf of Reprieve had been &quot;eye-opening&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s been fascinating. I&apos;ve loved the people I&apos;ve been working with \u2013 all really passionate human rights defenders \u2013 and being exposed to the differences in the legal systems, I suppose it really makes you realise how lucky we are in Australia.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/australia-culture-blog/2013/jul/25/better-man-sbs-review", "sentences": ["As the opening titles of SBS&apos;s first original drama in three years flicked onto screen, I considered what I knew about Van Tuong Nguyen, the 25-year-old Australian caught carrying heroin through Singapore, convicted of drug trafficking and executed.", "In 2006 I didn&apos;t live in Australia, so didn&apos;t follow the legal challenges to or media coverage of the Singaporean authorities&apos;s decisions in the same way as many Australians; I had formed no view on his culpability."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-25T22:49:05Z", "title": "Better Man - TV review", "tags": ["Culture", "Television", "Australia news"], "article": "As the opening titles of SBS&apos;s first original drama in three years flicked onto screen, I considered what I knew about Van Tuong Nguyen, the 25-year-old Australian caught carrying heroin through Singapore, convicted of drug trafficking and executed. In 2006 I didn&apos;t live in Australia, so didn&apos;t follow the legal challenges to or media coverage of the Singaporean authorities&apos;s decisions in the same way as many Australians; I had formed no view on his culpability. That won&apos;t have been the case for many viewers. For those less than entirely sympathetic to Nguyen&apos;s plight, Khoa Da&apos;s story of a reluctant drug mule caught in a perfect storm of honour, loyalty and torn emotions could perhaps prove testing. But as a piece of drama, and indeed polemic against the death penalty, Better Man is affecting and unsettling television. That is largely down to Remy Hii&apos;s remarkable performance as Van. Carrying essentially the whole narrative \u2013 other characters only flitting in to push the story forward \u2013 Hii shows enormous versatility and raw emotional heft: convincing as teen charmer, tourist in his own land, stressed-out kid barely keeping it together, and broken prisoner. It&apos;s the kind of part that actors yearn for, and then get tripped up by. Not in this case. It&apos;s a role made all the more difficult by its real-life dimension \u2013 an issue the script never quite manages to overcome, becoming somewhat boxed-in by the linear events of this one-person story. I was entirely won over by the first half of this episode, with its incredibly spare script and beautiful, saturated visuals; Van&apos;s trip to Vietnam an almost dreamlike interlude as he sloughs off the terrors of Cambodia and all its frightening consequences. Uncluttered by dialogue, Hii seemingly sweats the storyline straight onto screen as Van, alone and terrified, struggling to keep a lid on his panic. Despite \u2013 or maybe because of \u2013 the journey&apos;s inevitable conclusion, that anxiety manages to seep off screen and into the viewer. But from Nguyen&apos;s arrest onwards, Better Man becomes a more conventional and less engaging drama. Da has to pay for an opening that is largely free from explanation, with a second half that is almost more flashback than action. I am rarely convinced by this method of storytelling: nobody looks the age they should, the sepia-ish filter is irritating, and it feels like a last resort. There must surely have been a more elegant way of telling this story than going back in time as a response to police questioning \u2013 an unsophisticated approach which detracts from both Van&apos;s story and the tension of the interview. As the action becomes largely expositional, so too does the dialogue: the menacing, hissed threats of the opening scenes giving way to clangers: \u201cSo that means the kid could be all alone talking himself into a death sentence?\u201d It starts to feel like we&apos;re racing through plot points, rather than seeing a story cleverly revealed. But perhaps that&apos;s inevitable when dealing with a story that&apos;s so entirely helpless \u2013 we know what happens to Van, that the reluctant policeman won&apos;t help him, the high commissioner can&apos;t save him, that he won&apos;t wake up from this nightmare. When he whimpers \u201cCan I go home now?\u201d we know the answer. Such reservations are, in any case arguably less important than both the profound questions this drama prompts about the death penalty, and the fruits of the director/actor relationship between Da and Hii. For 90 minutes Hii owns the screen, whether flashing easy smiles at the girls or scrabbling in terror: a young man in way over his head, and unable to find his way back out. Regardless of the dramatic licence Da takes \u2013 and I understand he sometimes does \u2013 this is an astonishing performance. The second, and concluding part of the story next week sees Van&apos;s legal team descend in the shape of David Wenham, Claudia Karvan and Bryan Brown. That will certainly make the storytelling a great deal easier, allowing for more interaction and conversation and less reliance on hopping back in time (I hope). But for all of the incoming cast&apos;s star power, I doubt anyone will outshine Hii."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/26/prince-charles-mineral-water-middle-east", "sentences": ["Luxury Duchy Originals hampers, including bottles of lemon and ginger drinks, are also on sale at the SuperNature grocery 10,000 miles away by sea in Singapore, while bottles of Duchy-branded organic ale made with barley from the prince&apos;s Home Farm at Highgrove are being offered by drinks retailers in Australia and New Zealand.", "The vast majority of products we export are sea-freighted, with less than 1% of our Duchy Originals from Waitrose exports air-freighted, which makes sense from an environmental and a commercial perspective.&quot; Waitrose said it did not directly supply Duchy Originals hampers to Singapore or Duchy beer to the Middle East."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-26T16:47:10Z", "title": "Prince Charles mineral water shipped 6,000 miles to Middle East", "tags": ["Prince Charles", "Food", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Food & drink industry", "Climate change", "Environment", "Monarchy", "UK news", "Business"], "article": "Prince Charles is funding his charities with profits from shipping royal-branded mineral water 6,000 miles to the Middle East in an arrangement that has been described by Friends of the Earth as &quot;completely insane&quot;.

But he has used the proceeds from the export of bottles of Duchy Originals water from a Scottish estate close to Balmoral to luxury supermarkets in the Gulf to fund his favoured charities. It is part of a sales drive for the prince&apos;s groceries brand in conjunction with Waitrose which has delivered \u00a310m in profits over the past three years. Luxury Duchy Originals hampers, including bottles of lemon and ginger drinks, are also on sale at the SuperNature grocery 10,000 miles away by sea in Singapore, while bottles of Duchy-branded organic ale made with barley from the prince&apos;s Home Farm at Highgrove are being offered by drinks retailers in Australia and New Zealand. Environmentalists have called for the prince to bring the trade to an immediate halt. &quot;Shipping bottles of water around the world is completely insane,&quot; said Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth. &quot;It is absolutely ludicrous when there is perfectly good drinking water in the Middle East. It is very hard to dress up shipping water thousands of miles as helping the environment.&quot; The story has emerged 52 months after Charles made an apocalyptic speech in Rio de Janeiro warning that the world had &quot;less than 100 months to alter our behaviour before we risk catastrophic climate change&quot;. The Royal Deeside water is shipped from Aberdeenshire to branches of Spinneys in Dubai, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Waitrose declined to say how much goes to the Gulf because of &quot;commercial sensitivity&quot; but said it was &quot;very small&quot;. One thousand cases sent via the Suez canal would produce an estimated 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Jeanette Longfield, co-ordinator of Sustain, a campaign for sustainable food policies, said shipping water was &quot;lunacy&quot;. &quot;Once this is drawn to Prince Charles&apos;s attention I would hope he will decide this is not a good idea,&quot; she said. Prince Charles has cast himself as a protector of the environment. Duchy Originals, set up by the prince in 1990 &quot;to promote organic food and farming and to help protect and sustain the countryside and wildlife&quot;, began exporting in earnest after signing the Waitrose deal. It publishes a charter that explains: &quot;We aim for the smallest environmental footprint.&quot; The Prince of Wales&apos;s Charitable Foundation last year gave \u00a3200,000 to the Soil Association, which campaigns to &quot;minimise the local and global ecological footprint&quot; of food. A spokesman for the prince said: &quot;The Prince of Wales is aware that Waitrose is committed to reducing its environmental impact wherever possible. Duchy Originals from Waitrose has so far donated around \u00a33m a year to the Prince&apos;s Charitable Foundation, a grant-giving charity, and to the Prince&apos;s Countryside Fund, which supports Britain&apos;s hard pressed rural communities.&quot; The majority of royalties are generated from the sale of Duchy products in UK supermarkets but profits of around \u00a345,000 came from exports, including some that are air-freighted. A spokeswoman for Waitrose said: &quot;We are committed to reducing our environmental impact. The vast majority of products we export are sea-freighted, with less than 1% of our Duchy Originals from Waitrose exports air-freighted, which makes sense from an environmental and a commercial perspective.&quot; Waitrose said it did not directly supply Duchy Originals hampers to Singapore or Duchy beer to the Middle East. It is not the first time Charles has been accused over his carbon footprint.

I was with British Airways (BA) for 11 years finishing as area manager in Singapore but I became disillusioned about what I was doing. I felt I wasn&apos;t following my calling. So I made a radical move and took 18 months off to shadow people in different industries to discover what I should do. A friend of mine suggested shadowing a headteacher who had turned around a failing school. It was a lightbulb moment, I realised this was it, this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. So, how did you do it? I did a PGCE and then taught business studies and economics for three years. I made a conscious decision to teach in challenging schools. I joined the Future Leaders programme which catapulted me into leadership and I became associate deputy head at Hornsey School for Girls, this really helped me understand leadership from an educational perspective. What are the biggest differences in leadership in business and in schools? There aren&apos;t as many as you&apos;d think in terms of actual leadership. The real difference is learning to understand the idiosyncrasies of education. I felt well-versed in understanding leadership from my time at BA but I didn&apos;t understand how to blend it into the industry of education. After Hornsey I became vice principal at Pimlico school until I became head of Brightstowe. What&apos;s the hardest lesson you had to learn? Understanding the limitations there are in education that happen quite naturally because it&apos;s a state-run institution. At BA it&apos;s very clear because it&apos;s all about business, but in education there are many other things coming into play because we are responsible to the people. What attracted you to becoming the head at Brightstowe? I saw so much potential. Brightstowe Oasis Academy only opened in 2008. It used to be called Portway school, which was a failing school that had had a ridiculous number of heads in its last 11 years and a falling roll. The school became an Oasis Academy then I became head a year later. There were so many things I wanted to do and put in place, particularly in terms of structure and systems, the things some people might see as slightly less glamorous side of leadership. Would you describe yourself as a systems man? Yes. I firmly believe that&apos;s what leadership is all about. I&apos;ve brought that with me from my business background. I believe it is essential to build a school that is capable of carrying on even if I&apos;m not here. Otherwise I&apos;ve only built something that lasts as long as I&apos;m around. I&apos;ve got 100 fantastic staff here and my job is as a facilitator to enable my team to deliver, nothing else. I think we suffer a bit in education from the cult of personality. I&apos;ve nothing against heroes but I&apos;m not one of those people. I&apos;ve got friends I would classify as heroes, I&apos;m talking about guys who are six foot seven and can capture a room with just a wink but I&apos;m a normal guy and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s critical to be a hero to be a good leader. What&apos;s the problem with hero leaders? The danger is that when they walk out of the room you are left without a clue. When I leave the room I don&apos;t think anyone really notices. I&apos;m not being self deprecating here. How I see if is that it&apos;s not me that&apos;s grabbed this school by the scruff of its neck, there are a hundreds people who have done that. My job is to help them. Your school has improved its percentage of A-C GCSEs. Can you share some of the secrets? Yes in 2012 63% of our students achieved grades A*-C in their English and maths GCSEs which was a 33% increase on 2011 and across all subjects 96% of students achieved five GCSEs grade A*-C \u2013 making us the most improved school in the country. The first year I was head we didn&apos;t achieve such an impact. We spent a lot of time putting systems in place but they didn&apos;t equate to better results so we spent the next year focusing on what happens in the classroom to get results. I see a lot of great teaching in the schools I visit but sometimes outcomes aren&apos;t so good.  Our students can struggle with exams because they lack confidence and perseverance. I remember in my first year seeing a student I knew was capable of doing well with his head on his exam paper 30 minutes into the exam. He&apos;d met a question he couldn&apos;t answer and had given up. So our job is to help students not to fall at the first hurdle. It&apos;s not enough to give them great lessons, we have to spend as much time understanding how important those final two hours are. So we put a lot of lessons into practice in that second year and we saw a huge improvement in results. How difficult is it to change the reputation of a school? In an area like ours in Bristol, it&apos;s tough. We don&apos;t have a transient community, we have parents and grandparents who went to the old Portway and have very strong views about it. It takes a long time. I compare it to Skodas. It takes long enough for people to even take on board that they might be decent cars. Then they&apos;ll speak up about Skodas and say the are good cars, but when you ask them what car they&apos;re buying they&apos;ll say: &quot;I&apos;m going for a Volvo, they&apos;re reliable&quot;. Our polarised society is a real problem. People think that your stars are set from the background you are born into and that&apos;s something I refuse to believe. That&apos;s why I became a headteacher. Brightstowe is one of 26 Oasis academies. How actively do you work together and how similar are your schools? I describe it as a family of best practice. We limit prescription, every Oasis school is completely different. We have the same ethos and values based around inclusion, equality and hope but each school has its own vision and interpretation in our local environment. We share how we manage some things and moderate attendance and there are some great ideas that we all do the same. Why wouldn&apos;t I do something that has proved to be outstanding? What&apos;s the most useful lesson you&apos;ve learned? That a leader needs help. I&apos;ve got a leadership coach called Jerry Gilpin. It can be lonely as a head, you have to make life changing decisions all the time. You can&apos;t offload to your staff, it&apos;s not fair. I can&apos;t offload to my wife, we&apos;ve got two young children. I can&apos;t offload to my mates or they won&apos;t want to hang out with me. So I pay someone who I get on with very well to be my coach. My coach also works with my team, particularly the middle leaders. They say it&apos;s the most amazing thing they&apos;ve ever done in education. He uses the Myers Briggs personality leadership tool so help people understand what kind of leader they are. Other heads and teachers might say I&apos;m a real wuss for this, but why do we feel we in education have to prove we can take so much? People in industry know this and the toughest businesses out there have this support. Matt Butler is principal of Oasis Academy Brightstowe. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Note the 'New York' in that newspaper logo. Photograph: The Ronald Grant Archive    We are in the run-up to the transformation of the International Herald Tribune into the International New York Times. The grey lady is to become la dame grise. Romantics, which means those who saw Jean Seberg selling the paper in the 1960 movie \u00c0 Bout de Souffle, may regret this change of title. Then again, those romantics, as so often with nostalgia, forget what it actually said on her T-shirt: New York, not International, Herald Tribune. In fact, as the paper&apos;s current publisher, Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, is given to pointing out, &quot;New York&quot; rather than &quot;International&quot; has been part of the paper&apos;s title for 80 years of its 126-year existence. The change, due to take place on 15 October, is the logical consequence of the paper being wholly owned by the New York Times and the company&apos;s strategy in these digital days to broaden the international appeal of the core title. What this development indicates is the determination of the New York Times to build a world-wide audience through both print and online platforms. Naturally enough, a single brand - or &quot;global mono-brand&quot; to quote Dunbar-Johnson - aids that process. He consistently stresses the importance of extending the NYT&apos;s digital audience during my conference call to Paris with him and Dick Stevenson, who is to edit the International New York Times, thus becoming the paper&apos;s de facto Europe editor. Though both men are clearly happy with the paper&apos;s remarkably stable print sales, which stood at 224,771 at the last audit last year, their online focus is obvious. In accord with the New York Times company&apos;s chief executive, Mark Thompson, they are acutely aware of the challenge from other media outlets that are in the process of winning audiences across the globe. They include CNN, the BBC, Huffington Post, The Guardian, the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, where Dunbar-Johnson worked before joining the International Herald Tribune (IHT) in 1998 as its advertising director.  The NYT, which runs a metered paywall, has 708,000 digital subscribers, but only 10% of those come from outside the United States. &quot;The potential to grow internationally is therefore obvious,&quot; says Dunbar-Johnson. &quot;Our eye is on that potential.&quot; The emphasis is on persuading people to pay. &quot;That&apos;s increasingly important,&quot; he says. But is there a risk in alienating the current Tribune readership? After 15 years with the paper Dunbar-Johnson doesn&apos;t believe the new title will upset the &quot;special sensibilities&quot; of the IHT&apos;s loyal audience.  They are already widespread, with strong followings in France - the paper&apos;s home base since its foundation as the Paris Herald in 1887 - Italy, Germany and Switzerland. Some 50% are located in Asia, in Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Traditionally, there have been relatively few buyers in Britain, not least because of the vibrancy of the London-based national newspaper market.  Will the International New York Times be able to retain its identity? Stevenson says his job is to ensure that the editorial content retains the title&apos;s core characteristics.  One of these is undoubtedly the writing of Suzy Menkes. She joined the IHT in 1988 and, as of May this year, was given the title of &quot;international fashion editor&quot; of the International New York Times. &quot;Suzy is the gold standard,&quot; says Dunbar-Johnson. &quot;Her work already appears in the New York Times. This will continue.&quot; Stevenson, who will be based in Paris along with 120 editorial staff, will be in charge of 25 news bureaux and ensure that content is packaged to attract, and retain, readers in territories not properly exploited by the New York Times in the past. He will also seek to promote regionally tailored news, and views, through tablets and smartphones. He said: &quot;It&apos;s the first time the paper has delegated someone (me) with the authority to oversee New York Times correspondents in this part of the world.&quot; In directing coverage of European news, his major focus will be to ensure that it is published effectively online. The name-change initiative makes no sense unless it improves the digital readership. Similarly, it is hoped that the anticipated improved volume of online traffic can be parlayed into improving advertising take as companies increasingly mount global advertising campaigns.  In addition, the New York Times is eager to expand its conference and events business outside the US.

His plans are probably not unconnected with his break-up with the singer Nicole Scherzinger but it is also true that his 22nd race win, one of his best, has given him fresh impetus and he has chosen to train through the mid-season lay-off. At one point last year his father, Anthony, said his son had to win 10 races to win the championship and, while Hamilton did not feel capable of doing that in the McLaren, his victory in Hungary has instilled belief in his Mercedes. &quot;Last year I didn&apos;t feel like I had the car to win 10 races,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;This year I feel I have a car that can win 10 races. The tyres are going to play a massive part of that but I truly believe in this car. It feels awesome. &quot;It feels it&apos;s there with the Red Bulls and the Lotuses. I think our pace was very similar. If we can continue with that qualifying pace, get ourselves up front and have the tyres working as they did [on Sunday] we can fight with them.&quot; Hamilton said he found inspiration for his win when he saw his former team-mate Jenson Button holding up the world champion and leader Sebastian Vettel for 12 laps. The Mercedes driver made short work of Button when he emerged from the first of his three pit stops. &quot;Every lap, when I saw Jenson still ahead, I thought Jesus, I&apos;ve got to really make the gap now. And I think I did. The first few laps I wasn&apos;t making a gap because I was looking after my tyres, and then I thought I&apos;ve got to utilise this moment because as soon as he [Vettel] gets past he&apos;s probably going to hunt me down.&quot; He said he owed Button a beer. Hamilton&apos;s first win for Mercedes was his fourth at the Budapest track, equalling the record of Michael Schumacher. With nine races to go the 28-year-old, having gained 10 points on Vettel at the Hungaroring, is 48 points behind in the championship standings. It must encourage the British driver that he has previously won six of the nine races to come \u2013 Spa, Italy, Singapore, Japan, Abu Dhabi and America. &quot;The tracks coming up should suit me,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;I am really looking forward to the second half of the season; it&apos;s normally my favourite part. We have still got improvements to make but this is a good step in Hungary.&quot; The championship, he said, was &quot;definitely in the back of my mind. The win definitely picks you up for the next few days and keeps you on a high. It&apos;s like a natural high. A bit of a Band Aid which will cover me for some time.&quot; Hamilton continued: &quot;Going into the break there&apos;s no better feeling than to win and I&apos;ve been lucky enough to do it for many years with McLaren. It was always a really good boost for them knowing they could go into that period of time and relax with a win. I feel the same for Mercedes now. &quot;It&apos;s the first time they&apos;ve had that feeling. And it&apos;s a big boost. I&apos;ve just had a picture sent to me of the guys back at the factory celebrating. It&apos;s a big boost for us and maybe now we have a better chance moving forward for the next few races.&quot; Mercedes have dominated recent qualifying sessions but on race days they have struggled with their tyres. They also had to battle with an overheating engine in Hungary. Hamilton had thought he was an outside bet to take the chequered flag on Sunday. After all the controversy about the illegal tyre test in Barcelona Mercedes felt they were at a disadvantage in the race because they had not been allowed to test the new tyres, which were being used there for the first time. But, it seems, they suit the Mercedes fine. Hamilton said: &quot;I didn&apos;t really feel like I had a chance. Because when we did the practice we were half a second, eighttenths behind the Red Bulls on certain runs. And from past experience that&apos;s always been a disaster. &quot;And we didn&apos;t know anything about these tyres. I was shocked [at the start of the race]. I started going round and I was thinking the car&apos;s feeling pretty good, the tyres are feeling good, they&apos;re not catching me. &quot;And then when I came out of the pits ahead of Vettel it felt like I came out ever further ahead of him. He was only just coming out of the pits and I was already going into turn one and I thought, shoot, this is looking really good. &quot;It felt awesome when I was in the moment. I knew when I was going into the corners what I was going to do. When I was finishing the race I was thinking I know this track like the back of my hand. I know everywhere. And maybe the others don&apos;t know it as well.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/jul/30/showcase-home-based-innovation-little-pasta-organics", "sentences": ["Spotting a gap in the market for a range of pasta sauces for toddlers and kids that had no added salt or sugar, and were gluten free and contained super foods, we launched in 2011 and to date are supplying key retailers such as Ocado and as well as clients in Singapore and the UAE."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-30T14:22:27Z", "title": "Home Business Innovation: Little Pasta Organics", "tags": ["Small Business Showcase"], "article": "Name: Little Pasta OrganicsCity: LondonWebsite: www.littlepastaorganics.com  Little Pasta Organics&apos; mission is to introduce your little foodies to the flavours and delights of Italy through our range of organic pasta sauces for toddlers and kids.

Then he went on to criticise the gay &quot;lobby&quot; and said he wasn&apos;t going to break with the catechism that said &quot;homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered&quot;. Still, for a brief moment it looked like a minor breakthrough. Then you weigh it against a raft of anti-homosexuality legislation that is coming into force in countries across the world. In Russia, gay teenagers are being tortured and forcibly outed on the internet against a backdrop of laws that look completely out of step with the rest of Europe. In what is being described as rolling the &quot;status of LGBT [lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender] people back to the Stalin era&quot;, President Putin has passed a number of anti-gay laws, including legislation that punishes people and groups that distribute information considered &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations&quot;. The country also now has powers to arrest and detain foreign citizens believe to be gay, or &quot;pro-gay&quot;. It has led to the boycott of Russian vodka brands by gay bars and clubs in solidarity, started by writer and activist Dan Savage and taken up by bars in London. In many African countries where homosexuality is already illegal, more draconian anti-gay laws are being passed and violence against LGBT people is increasing. Is there a link between growing rights in some countries and worsening or removal of rights in others? &quot;There are really complicated links between the two. If you look at the history of the advancement of LGBT rights in the UK, every advance is accompanied by a backlash,&quot; says Alistair Stewart, assistant director of the Kaleidoscope Trust, a UK-based organisation that supports international LGBT rights. &quot;To a certain extent that&apos;s happening on a global scale now \u2013 the advances that are being made in some parts of the world encourage a backlash in other parts of the world. The struggle for even basic human rights for LGBT people \u2013 freedom of association, freedom from violence \u2013 becomes harder to achieve when the opponents can point to something like gay marriage, which isn&apos;t even on the books for most of the countries we&apos;re talking about and make the argument that &apos;if we give these people even the most basic of human rights, next they&apos;ll be asking to get married in our churches&apos;.&quot; Jonathan Cooper, chief executive of the Human Dignity Trust, is less sure they are related: &quot;The further persecution is already happening.&quot; The Human Dignity Trust challenges laws to end the persecution of LGBT people around the world. &quot;Most countries sign up to international human rights treaties. If you take Belize as an example, it has ratified all the key UN human rights treaties and in their constitution they have a right to a private life, to equality, to dignity. And so basically to criminalise homosexuality is a violation. To bring a legal challenge against that takes a very brave individual.&quot; It has been supporting Caleb Orozco, the gay rights campaigner who launched a legal challenge to overturn Belize&apos;s criminalisation laws. &quot;We&apos;re still waiting for the judgment. They said it would be out by the end of July but obviously it&apos;s not coming now.&quot; Orozco&apos;s case has prompted a backlash in Belize against him, and Unibam (the United Belize Advocacy Movement). A report last week from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the US civil rights organisation, highlighted the influence US hardline religious groups had in Belize and other countries. &quot;Many of these American religious-right groups know they have lost the battle against LGBT rights in the US, and they&apos;re now aiding and abetting anti-LGBT forces in countries where anti-gay violence is prevalent,&quot; said Heidi Beirich, author of the report. &quot;These groups are pouring fuel on an exceedingly volatile fire.&quot; It&apos;s the classic missionary model, says Stewart, &quot;where money and resources and organisation are set up in the countries that they are targeting&quot;. It&apos;s also worth remembering which country is responsible for the legacy of persecution faced by millions of LGBT people today. There are more than 75 countries where homosexuality is still criminalised: &quot;Forty-two of them are former British colonies so we can see where the legacy comes from,&quot; says Cooper. To see which countries are getting worse in terms of gay rights makes grim reading, but Stewart is cheered by the support he sees. &quot;One of the reassuring things that has come out of the response to the Russian laws in particular is there is a growing international apprehension. One of the last great undone pieces of the civil rights movement is to address the rights of LGBT people, and there does seem to be a growing international support for change.&quot; Where are LGBT rights improving?  Parts of Latin America remain the standard for equality for LGBT rights. Argentina&apos;s Gender Identity Law 2012 allowed the change of gender on birth certificates for transgender people. It also legalised same-sex marriage in 2010, giving same-sex couples the same rights as opposite-sex couples, including the right to adopt children. Uruguay and Mexico City also allow equal marriage and adoption, and last week Colombia recognised its first legal same-sex civil union (not &quot;marriage&quot;). In Asia, LGBT groups are making progess, if slowly. Last year, Vietnam saw its first gay pride rally and this year&apos;s event will launch a campaign for equality in employment. On Tuesday, it was reported that the country&apos;s ministry of justice has backed plans to legalise gay marriage, after the ministry of health came out for marriage equality in April. In Singapore the Pink Dot pride rally attracted 21,000 people at the end of June \u2013 its biggest number since it started four years ago. &quot;It&apos;s a strong signal that Singapore is not as conservative as some think,&quot; Paerin Choa, a rally spokesman, told Reuters. Just hours before attending the rally, Vincent Wijeysingha became Singapore&apos;s first openly gay politician when he officially came out. The country bans gay sex, though this is rarely enforced, but in April a gay couple, Gary Lim and Kenneth Chee, attempted to get the law removed. Their case was dismissed, but they are appealing with the help of Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney general.  The Human Dignity Trust filed a suit at the European court of human rights against Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus, the only place in Europe where homosexuality is still illegal, and looks likely to win. In a letter sent to the Kaleidoscope Trust, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago expressed her wish to repeal the laws that ban homosexuality. The prime minister of Jamaica, Portia Simpson Miller, has voiced similar wishes. In June, Javed Jaghai was the lastest activist to launch legal proceedings to challenge the anti-sodomy laws (however, violence against gay people is increasing, and 17-year-old Dwayne Jones was stabbed to death last week at a party according to local media reports). In Malawi, the president Joyce Banda announced in 2012 that laws criminalising homosexuality would be repealed \u2013 she has since distanced herself from that, although there has been a moratorium and there have been no prosecutions. &quot;So it&apos;s not just the global north where things are moving forward. In some parts of the world where you&apos;d least expect them, things are getting better,&quot; says Stewart. The number of countries legalising same-sex marriage continues to grow, with Denmark, Brazil, France and New Zealand just some that joined more progressive countries that had legalised it earlier. Last month in the US, where Barack Obama publicly supports equal marriage and it is legal in several states, the supreme court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act (which prevented the federal government from recognising marriages between gay couples) as unconstitutional. And of course England and Wales now has the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. Where are LGBT rights worsening? In Iran, a place where homosexuality is punishable by death and you thought LGBT rights couldn&apos;t really get worse, this year the country&apos;s official who works on human rights described homosexuality as &quot;an illness that should be cured&quot;. Of course, gay rights are no better in many other Middle Eastern countries. The ILGA (International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association) provides a comprehensive look at state-sponsored homophobia in a 2013 report.     Gay-rights activist Yury Gavrikov is detained by riot police at a rally in Moscow in May. Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images    Two weeks ago, Eric Ohena Lembembe, was found at home in Yaound\u00e9, the capital of Cameroon. He had been tortured \u2013 his neck and feet broken, his body burned with an iron \u2013 and murdered. As the executive director of Camfaids, Lembembe was one of Cameroon&apos;s most prominent and outspoken LGBT rights activists and openly gay \u2013 an astonishing act of bravery in a country where homosexuality is punishable with prison and violence against LGBT people is common and almost never investigated. Amnesty International&apos;s 2013 report on global human rights stated even people who supported LGBT rights were being harrassed, particularly equality lawyers Alice Nkom and Michel Togue who had both received calls and text messages threatening to kill them and their children if they did not stop defending gay people who had been arrested. In June this year, Togue&apos;s office was broken into and files and computers stolen. In\u00a0March 2012, a workshop held to educate young people about LGBT issues was shut down. Last week, two men were given prison sentences under the country&apos;s anti-gay laws; in 2011, another man, Jean-Claude Roger Mb\u00e9d\u00e9, was sentenced to three years in prison for sending a text message to another man. Men who are perceived to be gay are arrested, somtimes only on the basis of someone&apos;s suspicions, and some are forced to undergo rectal examinations and tortured into confessing. &quot;They have such an active prosecution system,&quot; says Cooper. &quot;Although prosecutions do occur in other jurisdictions, you don&apos;t have that kind of active prosecution policy that you have in Cameroon.&quot; After the death of Lembembe, gay-rights groups said they couldn&apos;t continue their work unless they are given protection by international donors who fund the fight against HIV/Aids. &quot;We have all decided to stop our work in the field because our security is at risk,&quot; said Yves Yomb, executive director of Alternatives-Cameroun. &quot;We have no protection from the police and we feel that our lives are at risk.&quot; Sharing a border with Cameroon, Nigeria&apos;s anti-gay laws are becoming ever more draconian. It recently passed a bill outlawing same-sex marriage, punishable with a 14-year prison term. &quot;Nobody in the country is seriously asking for gay marriage,&quot; says Stewart from the Kaleidoscope Trust. &quot;There is no reason to legislate against it, when homosexual sex is already illegal. It also has more concerning provisions that ban the formation of groups that support LGBT rights and a series of provisions that if you know a homosexual but don&apos;t turn them in, you are aiding and abetting. That isn&apos;t on the statute books yet but it seems likely that it will pass in some form.&quot; Politicians in Uganda are attempting to pass a similar bill, at one point seeking to punish homosexual relationships with the death penalty; people found guilty of being gay will now face life imprisonment, and anybody \u2013 parents, teachers, doctors \u2013 who suspects someone in their care is gay will be punished if they do not report them. Last week, President Mugabe told a rally of Zanu PF supporters that Zimbabwe would never accept homosexuality, and that gay people were &quot;worse than pigs, goats and birds&quot;. There are 38 African countries where homosexuality is illegal. In Russia, gay rights are moving further away from other European countries. In an extreme version of Britain&apos;s section 28, a new law will punish anybody disseminating &quot;propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors expressed in distribution of information \u2026 aimed at the formation \u2026 of \u2026 misperceptions of the social equivalence of traditional and non-traditional sexual relations&quot;. It has also failed to comply with the 2010 judgment at the European court of human rights that requires it to allow gay pride events. Violence against LGBT people is rising. In May, there was a brutal murder of a man who had revealed to &quot;friends&quot; he was gay. Official numbers of homophobic attacks are low, but LGBT activists say this is because attacks are not often reported, and when they are police rarely label them as such, but one poll last year of nearly 900 people by the Russian LGBT Network found more than 15% had experienced physical violence between November 2011 and August 2012. Last week, the Pink News reported neo-Nazi groups in Russia has been luring gay teenagers to meetings, where they are forced to come out in videos that are then posted on social media sites. It reported that one victim, 19-year-old Alex Bulygin, killed himself after his sexuality was revealed. Russia&apos;s renewed attacks on homosexuality may be spreading beyond its borders \u2013 there are moves in Ukraine to adopt its own ban on &quot;gay propaganda&quot; and in May the parliament dropped a bill that would have outlawed discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation after a protest by anti-gay activists. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 July 2013.

The rebranded Airbus group will be split into three divisions, the company announced on Wednesday: commercial planes; defence and space; and military and civilian helicopters. It is the most significant corporate shakeup for the business since the German government blocked a \u20ac35bn (\u00a330.6bn) merger between EADS and British defence group BAE Systems last year. &quot;The renaming simply gathers the entire company under the best brand we have, one that stands for internationalisation, innovation and integration \u2013 and also for some two-thirds of our revenues,&quot; said the chief executive, Tom Enders. &quot;It reinforces the message that &apos;we make things fly&apos;.&quot; The change in branding underscores the importance of the commercial planes business and its rapidly growing order book. In the first six months of 2013, Airbus Commercial netted 722 orders for aircraft, up sharply on 230 for the same period last year. At the Paris Air Show alone, Airbus took orders for 241 planes, including 65 orders for the A350 from Air France, Singapore Airlines and United Airlines. Airbus has been battling it out with Boeing for supremacy in the \u00a366bn-a-year passenger jet market, after its US rival took the top spot last year in both orders and deliveries. Revenues for the military arm of the Airbus business were also up, even though orders for military aircraft fell to eight aircraft from 21. Eurocopter, which makes civilian and military helicopters, reported a 7% fall in revenues as the company delivered fewer helicopters. But overall, the better-than-expected performance helped lift EADS&apos;s revenues for the first half of the year by 6% to \u20ac26.3bn (\u00a322bn). The re-organisation is due to be complete by the end of 2014 and Enders said it was the logical next step for the company. &quot;We affirm the predominance of commercial aeronautics in our group and we restructure and focus our defence and space activities to take costs out, increase profitability and improve our market position.&quot; The markets cheered the news with EADS shares rising 2.16% on the Paris stock exchange to \u20ac45.22."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/31/the-fiver-club-website-statements", "sentences": ["The key point: &quot;I&apos;m not angry with Liverpool \u2013 quite the opposite.&quot; And Manchester United have named PepsiCo as Official Drinks Partner in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos and Brunei, joining a family of partners including Official Manchester United Noodles Partner Mamee."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-31T14:53:34Z", "title": "The Fiver | TVs have exited the window and met the pavement | Ian McCourt", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "STATEMENTS OF INTENT Dammit man!

I remember the bells ringing out in his home parish of St Ignatius, Richmond, 25 times \u2013 one for each year of his life \u2013 and people wearing yellow ribbons gathered, some crying in the pews, and the news crews outside Changi prison late at night and into the dawn. It was reported that he accepted his death with dignity and grace. Arguments about the death penalty\u00a0raged.\u00a0 Maybe I remember these things so clearly because for me, Nguyen\u2019s hanging represented some sort of turning.\u00a0It was a disbelief that the state could do that \u2013 that the death penalty was still in the legal system\u2019s tool kit. I\u2019d been a young lawyer in a deprived rural area and had seen the wheels turn. There were options \u2013 both in sentencing, and for the accused. The prospect of rehabilitation is explicit in our legal system, no-one can be entirely written off. The capacity for change runs deep in our nature. As for my own beliefs, I\u2019m the product of a certain brand of Catholicism typical in Australia. It\u2019s lapsed and it\u2019s lazy, its masses in primary school and a basic knowledge of the Bible. But there is, at the core, an assumption of certain principles: redemption, mercy, forgiveness. And a recoiling at a human or state hand playing any part in deciding when and how someone should die. The story of Nguyen\u00a0in prison (one represented, not without controversy in the TV series\u00a0Better Man\u00a0currently shown on SBS) is this: sorrow, atonement, a request for forgiveness and finally, at the end, grace. The story of his death is the one of the state playing God. The death penalty is like taking something barbaric and raw, and folding it into the mechanics of the state \u2013 a grim procession of appeals and denials, of applications and refusals, of meeting between ministers, of official letters, committees and protocol. In a letter to his mother, the state fixed the time and place of his death: 6am on 2 December 2005. It seems primally unnatural to set a time for someone\u2019s death. Of course, there is the argument that trafficking drugs leads to the death of countless others who use your drugs, and that death is a just punishment. I like Auberon Waugh\u2019s response:  Judicial execution can never cancel or remove the atrocity it seeks to punish; it can only add a second atrocity to the original one \u2026 So long as one sees killing as wrong there is no need to waste time with the deterrent argument, since it would be nonsense to try to prevent a theoretical evil in the future by perpetrating an actual one in the present  Each generation seems to have its death penalty cases whose aftershocks are felt long after the execution. When\u00a0George Orwell witnessed a hanging in colonial Burma, he wrote:  It is curious, but till that moment I had never realised what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we are alive.  Likewise, the hanging of Ronald Ryan in Victoria politicised many. For Labor party elder Barry Jones, campaigning against the death penalty led to his resignation from the state education department in 1967. Steve Price wrote recently in the Herald Sun about the hanging of Barlow and Chambers, years ago now, but the memory still fresh for him:  Anyone involved with their case could never forget it and in July 1986 the afternoon Melbourne Herald newspaper tried to ram home just how final death at the end of a rope for drug trafficking could be.\u00a0I can still see the banner headline: IT&apos;S DONE, above a photograph of the bodies of the two young men covered by a sheet. One corpse had an identity tag hanging from the dead man&apos;s big toe.  To get near the death penalty even as reporter is to feel tainted in its aftermath, often for years later. One of Australia\u2019s most fearless photographers, Kate Geraghty \u2013 who\u2019s been the world\u2019s worst war zones \u2013 wrote to me last week about Van Nguyen: \u201cI photographed Nguyen\u00a0when I spent two weeks with his lawyers and two friends in Singapore. It was one assignment that shook me to my core.\u201d It\u2019s not just the media or the lawyers. There are those of us who watched the reports of Nguyen\u2019s hanging on breakfast television. Who stopped what they were doing that morning, listened and felt the very strange experience of experiencing in real time the death of someone. It was not a good feeling. I now sit on the executive committee for Reprieve and was a co-founder of the Mercy Campaign which is campaigning for clemency for members of the Bali 9 on death row \u2013 Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.\u00a0My involvement is as a result of feeling angry, sad and powerless the day Nguyenn was executed. Many of the Mercy Campaign\u2019s volunteers were moved by Nguyen\u2019s story seven years ago, and didn\u2019t want the same thing repeated in Bali. The execution jolted them. They didn\u2019t know Nguyen, they had no stake in the matter \u2013 but the fact that people are still being executed was such a shock to some core sense of humanity that it politicised them. They are among the more than a hundred young Australians who have worked for free on death row cases in the US southern death penalty states; they are Australians who are working (also for free) in Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia with local lawyers on death penalty cases involving not Australians anyone on death row who needs assistance. None of us want a life in full tide cut off without a fight."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/01/open-court-royal-theatre-new-writing", "sentences": ["Its plays have been produced all around the world, 10 getting major American premieres and others reaching Germany, Australia, Singapore and the prestigious Avignon festival."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-01T07:35:00Z", "title": "Open Court: did it change the face of new writing?", "tags": ["Royal Court theatre", "Fringe theatre", "Theatre", "Stage", "Culture"], "article": "It was either going to be a perfect marriage or a Valentine&apos;s Day massacre. On 14 February this year, 80 leading playwrights gathered at the Royal Court at the invitation of incoming artistic director Vicky Featherstone. Martin Crimp, Caryl Churchill, Nick Payne and Lucy Kirkwood were just a few of those present. &quot;Put it this way,&quot; says David Eldridge, another Royal Court regular in attendance. &quot;You didn&apos;t want a gas explosion in Sloane Square.&quot; The date was fitting. Playwrights love the Royal Court like no other theatre, and the feeling&apos;s mutual. It has always insisted on the writer&apos;s centrality, that \u2013 as Anthony Neilson puts it \u2013 &quot;without a writer of some sort, nothing else happens&quot;. Featherstone&apos;s first move was to make them more central than ever, asking them to collectively programme her first season. The result was Open Court, a kaleidoscopic festival of new writing in all shapes and sizes that finished last week. It included debut plays, experimental collaborations and formal innovation. Dramatists, storytellers, verbatim playwrights and poets presented monologues, lectures, readings and audio plays. Writers ranged from eight to 88; there was a Royal Court debut almost every day. Even those pieces that could readily be described as &quot;plays&quot; were fantastically varied. New writing felt up for grabs in a way it hasn&apos;t for years. Most of all, perhaps, Open Court forced us to reconsider our understanding of a playwright as someone who write plays. Mark Ravenhill penned a lecture drawn from verbatim interviews with other writers, part of a &quot;surprise&quot; stand that invited audiences to buy a ticket without knowing what the show would be. Rachel De-lahay and Bola Agbaje, leading a writing team, created a staged soap opera set and performed in Peckham, south London. Others used devising techniques and curating events. Of course much have this has been happening for a while. Writers such as Tim Crouch and Chris Goode have never quite fitted the mould, and playwrights such as Lucy Kirkwood and Elinor Cook have written for more experiential forms including site-specific work and audiotours. Last year another new-writing specialist, London&apos;s Bush theatre, changed its literary policy to admit a wider range of work. However, for this attitude to emerge at the Royal Court \u2013 the home of writers such as John Osborne, Arnold Wesker and Churchill and for long regarded as the UK&apos;s flagship new-writing venue \u2013 still seems like a surprise. On the face of it, new writing is having a golden age. Since 2000, according to critic Aleks Sierz&apos;s 2011 book Rewriting the Nation, the number of new plays has doubled, box office reached almost 70% and more than 350 playwrights have had their first play staged. The Royal Court has been at the forefront of these trends. In the last five years, it&apos;s had six West End transfers and two Broadway runs. Its plays have been produced all around the world, 10 getting major American premieres and others reaching Germany, Australia, Singapore and the prestigious Avignon festival. The theatre&apos;s development schemes involve 150 emerging writers a year and many have gone on to establish themselves at the very highest level; most recently Nick Payne, Lucy Kirkwood and James Graham. But writer Roy Williams, for one, argues that all this itself isn&apos;t enough. &quot;I&apos;m waiting for another Shopping and Fucking or another Saved,&quot; he says. &quot;Something that&apos;s going to make a noise; someone to make their mark. I don&apos;t want this theatre to be seen as a conveyor belt to the West End. That&apos;s not what the Royal Court&apos;s about: it&apos;s about taking risks and telling stories about now.&quot; Williams&apos; concern is by no means unusual. Most of the playwrights I spoke to during Open Court concurred. Eldridge warned against &quot;a grey blob of homogeneity&quot;. London Road writer Alecky Blythe hopes &quot;the changing of the guard will shake things up&quot;. Neilson spoke about &quot;a culture of timidity&quot;, whereby &quot;new plays by younger writers are becoming successes \u2013 they&apos;re good pieces \u2013 but they&apos;re fitting some established form&quot;. Even emerging playwrights such as Alistair McDowall, 25, express frustrations. &quot;I&apos;d like to see less well-crafted, well-acted plays and more theatrical defiance,&quot; he says. &quot;Plays that might be an absolute mess, but aren&apos;t boring for a second.&quot; Consensus puts these concerns down to an inflexible approach to development across the theatre industry that feeds every new play through the same process of readings and redraftings. Inevitably, the tendency is towards conformity: plays that adhere to the same principles, techniques and formal structures. &quot;I see a lot of plays that get the life rewritten out of them,&quot; says Neilson. &quot;We&apos;ve fallen into a pattern where the writer&apos;s relationship to a play has become very mediated \u2026 As long as that system exists, you&apos;ve got to question how cosmetic the notion of a writer being at the heart of something is.&quot; Simultaneously, a surge in the number of playwrights has increased competition for productions. &quot;The idea is that it&apos;s a race that not everyone will finish,&quot; explains Penelope Skinner, whose hugely successful Royal Court debut The Village Bike will get its US premiere this autumn. &quot;There&apos;s a sense that you get culled as you go along, and whether or not you get culled depends on those first couple of productions.&quot; That means the temptation is to play it safe and stay in the race. However, Eldridge reckons that risk aversion goes against most writers&apos; natural instincts. &quot;There&apos;s this idea that&apos;s persisted for a long time that writers are formally conservative. That&apos;s always been bollocks in my view. The writers I know are interested in making work in different ways, in moving their own work forwards and in moving theatre forwards. &quot;It&apos;s a mistake to assume that playwrights only see and enjoy new plays that are quite like the one&apos;s they&apos;ve written themselves. We&apos;ve all been to the Young Vic. We&apos;ve all seen work by Shunt, Chris Goode and others,&quot; he says. &quot;Theatres are beginning to appreciate that if you can open up the process for a writer in all sorts of different ways, there&apos;s the potential to make really interesting work.&quot; Neilson believes that the standard development model has allowed writers to forget that they&apos;re writing first and foremost for a live event. &quot;There&apos;s this idea of polish and honing something, which sounds wonderful, but it&apos;s not really the point. It&apos;s a bit like going to see a band that play perfect reproductions of their album. Theatre&apos;s a live art and it should be repositioned as such, rather than as a branch of literature.&quot; Neilson himself employs a particular process that involves writing in between workshops with his cast. His scripts emerge out of and evolve over a six-week rehearsal process. He spent part of the Open Court season introducing a number of young playwrights to the technique. &quot;It&apos;s an alternative model of play development and it should be on the menu,&quot; he argues. Eldridge has been in the rehearsal room too: writing a play that caters to a particular leading actor. It means he now starts with a week of exploratory, free-form workshops, getting to know the actor&apos;s range and style. As Williams points out, such methods won&apos;t work for every writer: having a range of options is the thing. &quot;The worry of any system is when it becomes fixed, rather than engaging on a one-to-one basis to find out what an individual writer needs. If they need a reading, give them a reading. If they need a production, give them a production.&quot; That&apos;s exactly what happened, Williams explains, to his first play, The No Boys Cricket Club. Having submitted the script to Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1996, &quot;three months later, they programmed it. You don&apos;t hear of that any more. If a theatre reads a script and they&apos;re blown away by it, they need to take a chance.&quot; But therein lies the issue: risk. Squeeze funding, and new writing is especially vulnerable. &quot;Theatres have to survive to do anything,&quot; Neilson points out, &quot;so if you cut funding, the first thing that suffers is the unknown: the new writer. Faced with doing three productions instead of four, there&apos;s no theatre on earth that&apos;s going to give those slots to new writing.&quot; Open Court has demonstrated an alternative model; one that ensures new writing makes it to the stage, albeit in a more ad hoc fashion than usual. Inevitably shows lacked the polish and nuance of a fully fledged production \u2013 which might do some types of play a disservice \u2013 but more often than not, they gained a sense of presence and the electricity of uncertainty. These plays became events, not literature in three dimensions. Ensuring the flexibility of the development process, allowing writers extra resources and seeking out new voices all require investment. As Fin Kennedy&apos;s In Battalions report, published back in February, has already shown, cuts to arts funding are impacting on new writing, with productions, commissions and development models being scaled back across the country. The danger is clear: just as British new writing looks set to reinvent itself, it could find the rug pulled out from underneath its feet."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/01/clearing-advice-study-abroad", "sentences": ["The University of Sheffield offers the chance to study in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore or the USA as part of a three-year undergraduate degree."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-01T08:30:00Z", "title": "Clearing 2013: think about studying abroad", "tags": ["Clearing", "Advice for students", "A-levels", "Applying to university", "Studying abroad", "Sixth form"], "article": "Packing up your possessions, moving out of home and embarking on a degree with a group of strangers sounds overwhelming enough without throwing in a foreign country, new language and different time zone. But if you&apos;ve never thought about studying abroad, maybe now is the time to consider it. Broadly speaking, there are two options \u2013 studying a full degree at a university in another country or enrolling at a British university with the option of spending a single year or semester abroad, either at a sister institution or through a programme such as Erasmus. Students who do a full three- or four-year degree abroad pay the tuition fees that apply to international students in that country, and these can vary hugely. Three years at a top university in the US could cost $60,000 (\u00a339,300) in tuition fees alone, whereas studying in Scandinavia is usually free. If you do a year or semester abroad\u00a0organised through a UK institution, you pay no fees to the foreign university and a fraction (usually up to half) of the normal fees to your home institution. The University of Sheffield offers the chance to study in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore or the USA as part of a three-year undergraduate degree. Elsewhere, studying abroad often means taking a four-year degree. The USA and Australia are popular options for UK students because there is no language barrier, but don&apos;t discount other parts of the world. Many universities, especially in Europe and the Far East, now offer degree programmes in English and some home institutions have affiliated campuses around the world. The University of Nottingham, for example, has a campus in Malaysia. But if the challenge of another language appeals, the Erasmus programme should be your first call. For 26 years, it has been offering students the chance to study in one of 32 European countries for a year or semester as part of their degree. Participating students receive a non-repayable grant (the amount depends on the country of study) in addition to their regular student loan. The benefits of studying abroad can be huge. Immersing yourself in a different culture, experiencing new social and political structures, and picking up a language are all CV gold, not to mention the chance to study at world-class institutions. But, if you&apos;re interested, you need to act quickly. Applications for full international study must be made early to allow time for visa approval, while home universities with options of a year abroad usually require applications to be made by December of your first year. Jess Linn, who spent a year in New Jersey as part of her art, film and theatre degree at Reading University, says she gained more than expected from studying abroad, and that it was the best part of her time at university. &quot;The chance to experience a different culture and learn about yourself is invaluable. I\u00a0would wholeheartedly recommend it.&quot; Resources \u2022 The Top Universities website has resources to help students to research their study abroad options, including a great guide to applying for a student visa. \u2022 The UK Council for International Student Affairs has advice and information for home students studying abroad. \u2022 Prospects has a collection of case\u00a0studies from students who have studied abroad, plus profiles of countries and universities. \u2022 ESL Language Travel has details of language and education programmes in 40 countries. \u2022 The Study Options website can tell you everything you need to know about studying in Australia and New Zealand. \u2022 The National Union of Students has excellent guides to studying abroad, including ones on applications and studying in the EU. \u2022 Erasmus the educational exchange programme has details about its year- and semester-long placements in Europe. \u2022 The Complete University Guide has articles about studying overseas and info about funding.

In an interview in 2000 with the magazine for alumni of New Zealand&apos;s Massey University, which he attended in the 1970s, McEwan also admitted that passing his accountancy level 2 did not feel like a priority at the time. Sport and having fun mattered more. He conceded, though, that given his career of choice \u2013 in the financial world \u2013 he wished he had &quot;put more time into it&quot;. It did not hold him back. He became one of the youngest chief executives in New Zealand, running the local operations of the French insurance company Axa not long after he turned 40. He rose to the top after starting out in personnel-type jobs at Unilever, Dunlop and then National Mutual (which became Axa). He also spent 1985 travelling to the US, UK and Europe.

Tea Party candidates on the right have been able to generate excitement among GOP base voters with their calls to end the National Security Agency&apos;s domestic spying program. Senator Rand Paul appears to have staked his entire potential presidential campaign on a brash defense of personal privacy (except when it comes to abortion). Libertarian-leaning Republicans in the House have been unapologetic in their criticism of the program, their own energy magnified by near-unanimous support from conservative talk radio and bloggers. Those advocates of civil liberties (some of them quite new to the cause) have a convenient explanation for why Democrats have been less vocal and slower to criticize the collection of metadata from everyday American citizens: slavish devotion to President Obama, whatever policies he might champion.  This is an easy argument to make \u2013 and it goes both ways. Polling among Democratic and Republican voters shows a mirror-image of approval for Obama&apos;s use of the tactic to Bush&apos;s use of it. Since 2002, the number of Democrats who approved monitoring online activities has increased 12 points; among Republicans it has decreased 13 points. Since 2006, the number of Republicans who say the government should prioritize privacy over hunting terrorists has risen 22 points; Democrats who say the government should prioritize preventing terrorism over privacy has gone up 18 points. The neatness of these changes in position is almost disturbing. It suggests that advocacy for civil liberties is a zero-sum game: there&apos;s only so much libertarianism to be had at any given historical moment, there&apos;s a ceiling on Americans&apos; ability to believe that the right to privacy is paramount. Indeed, as you might suspect from the numbers above, polling among all Americans on the balance of national security to privacy has neatly flipped as well. The percentage of voters that worry that the US will go &quot;too far&quot; in violating privacy rights in pursuit of terrorists versus &quot;not going far enough&quot; is now 56% percent versus 36%. In 2001, after the 9/11 attacks, it was 31% versus 55%. It&apos;s these numbers, rather than the occupant of the White House, that explains Democrats&apos; reluctance to move very aggressively in championing personal privacy \u2013 or, at least, it explains the difficulty in creating a lasting coalition around it. If at best, you will only get half the country to agree with you \u2013 and what&apos;s more, different phrasing of the question or current events context shows inherent wobbliness on the issue \u2013 what politician will stick out his (or her) neck over it? Already, the roster of 2016 presidential candidates illustrates the ambivalence of those who would like retain &quot;electable&quot; and &quot;moderate&quot; as part of their bio. While the skirmish between Chris Christie and Paul over terrorism and its prevention via surveillance got a lot of media attention this week, it&apos;s more helpful to look at the general trend among potential candidates. There, with candidates in both parties, the message on warrantless wiretaps and email surveillance is instructively equivocal \u2013 or, rather, clearly unclear\u2026 and the view gets more hazy, the greater the likelihood of the candidate. Hillary Clinton, for instance, has done an elegant disappearing act with her views. She has gone from a vocal critic to silent beneficiary of the same programs. Once loud-mouthed Joe Biden has been just as mum. On the right, Marco Rubio refuses to condemn the process, only saying:   It&apos;s a struggle to balance our deeply held convictions of privacy and freedoms and liberties with our need to provide for national security.   Governor Bobby Jindal does the same kind of hand-wringing, saying only that the balance between promoting a smaller government and national security issues is a debate worth having.  Senator John Thune and former House member, now senator, Rob Portman speak with the same precise restraint. Former GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan straddles the divide more obviously; he told reporters that the NSA practices were &quot;creepy&quot; but voted to continue funding them.  On the left, even Senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 generally presumed about as far left as a mainstream candidate can go \u2013 has called simply, safely for &quot;an informed discussion&quot;. Most of the governors in the running (and most of the named prospective candidates are governors) have been spared having to comment on the controversy at all. I have a lot faith in Americans&apos; inherent distaste for government intrusion into their lives. My theory of American civil rights has always been that we move forward, and sometime backward, to the exact degree that a majority of Americans can be convinced that the issue is fundamentally about being left alone to live one&apos;s life with minimum snooping or control from anyone. It&apos;s true for marriage equality, reproductive rights, providing a path to citizenship for illegal aliens, the tenacity of Second Amendment beliefs, and an argument can be made that the protection of voting rights can be manipulated to either side&apos;s advantage along these lines as well: we just don&apos;t like to see our fellow citizens hassled. (Conservatives show footage of Black Panthers at the polls, progressives harken back \u2013 not very far \u2013 the obstacles white legislators put in front of black voters.) The problem with applying this theory to the right to private communication, virtual assembly, and expression is that we don&apos;t see the oppression very much. You cannot hold up a picture of someone being electronically spied on; even worse, you cannot illustrate the psychic damage and cowed sensibilities that come with the fear of being spied on. Undermining the cause further is that to champion civil liberties is, in a way, to champion inaction. Politicians cannot say, &quot;I did this thing for you,&quot; they have to say, &quot;I did not do this thing.&quot; Yes, to a certain slice of voters that is the exact message that propels them to the polls; a large majority of Americans what to see things happen. Yes, advocates can hold up examples of the police power run amok. I think this even works, a little. More Americans see Edward Snowden as a &quot;whistleblower&quot; than a criminal, for instance. But it takes an act of muscular imagination to transfer his experience to one&apos;s own.  Compare this to the visceral reaction one has to images of a terrorist attack. The immediate sense that &quot;it could have been me&quot;. And as for how terrorist attacks engender the desire for protection \u2013 a very particular kind of action by authorities. And the heroics stances that politicians can make when they say that they have saved you! It is cynical but true that one reason 2016 candidates have refrained from speaking too loudly on domestic spying is their understanding of this very dynamic. One bomb, one devastating video, one instance when our agencies can prove a near-miss and a denouncement of surveillance becomes a millstone and not a platform.  An attack could produce the desperate acceptance of a security state in an instant. But it is difficult to imagine the incidents that would spur momentum towards a broader movement for and understanding of the right to privacy. And if you can imagine America coming to that \u2013 whether it looks like 1984 or Singapore \u2013 well, by then it will be too late."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/03/government-adviser-spot-checks-illegal-migrants", "sentences": ["The dispute over the Home Office&apos;s controversial spot-check searches for illegal immigrants has escalated, as one of the government&apos;s own migration advisers warned that Britain should not adopt the draconian tactics of countries such as Singapore in dealing with the issue.", "He said: &quot;In liberal democracies generally we don&apos;t want to do the kinds of things that are commonplace in Singapore or maybe the Middle East."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-03T19:30:00Z", "title": "Government adviser's warning over spot checks for illegal immigrants", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "UK news", "Politics", "Conservatives", "Liberal Democrats", "Theresa May", "Race issues"], "article": "The dispute over the Home Office&apos;s controversial spot-check searches for illegal immigrants has escalated, as one of the government&apos;s own migration advisers warned that Britain should not adopt the draconian tactics of countries such as Singapore in dealing with the issue. Last week Home Office officials, accompanied by police officers wearing stab vests, conducted a series of checks, mainly at railway stations, as they sought to find immigrants illegally living in the country. It followed the rollout of a number of vans displaying signs encouraging illegal immigrants to &quot;go home&quot; in a pilot that has been widely criticised as heavy-handed. Mark Harper, minister for immigration, defended the government against claims that its spot checks were random by pointing to the number of arrests of suspected illegal immigrants. Yet, speaking to the Observer about last week&apos;s crackdown at railway stations, Dr Martin Ruhs, a longstanding member of the government&apos;s migration advisory committee, said that he believed the issue was being oversimplified by policymakers. He said: &quot;In liberal democracies generally we don&apos;t want to do the kinds of things that are commonplace in Singapore or maybe the Middle East. &quot;You have to draw the line somewhere. Different people will draw the line in different places over what is acceptable in how you treat people. Obviously the government has to do something about irregular immigration, but the issue is more complex than many policymakers believe. Some policies have an element of a spectacle \u2013 you want to send a signal, and those policies aren&apos;t necessarily the most effective.&quot; Ruhs spoke out as evidence also emerged of growing tensions within the government, with one senior Liberal Democrat source insisting that there had been no agreement within the coalition to target areas containing a large proportion of ethnic minorities with spot checks, and expressed concern over the direction of travel of Theresa May, the home secretary, and her fellow Tory ministers. The source said: &quot;We would have strong concerns about any suggestion of blanket racial profiling in high ethnic-minority areas. We have not agreed to any such policy as it would be a disproportionate, distasteful and ineffective way to tackle illegal immigration.&quot; The home secretary, who is widely believed to have ambitions for the leadership of the Conservative party, is particularly keen to be seen to have got to grips with immigration and is expected to announce further controversial policies this month. The Observer has learned that special advisers working for May have had a series of meals with representatives of the controversial thinktank Migration Watch, which recently predicted that 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians will come each year for the next five years from 2014 when people there are allowed to work in the UK. Three of May&apos;s advisers last had a lunch with representatives of Migration Watch in March, the third such meeting in two years. In another development, the Observer has learned that May has also launched a strongly worded attack on a high court judge in legal documents recently filed in regard to her policy of setting earnings thresholds for people wishing to sponsor the UK visas of spouses coming from abroad. Last month Mr Justice Blake said the policy was a disproportionate interference in people&apos;s lives and suggested the income threshold should be lowered from around \u00a318,000 to \u00a313,000. Legal documents submitted by May in appeal, and obtained by the Observer, hit out at the courts by claiming Blake had committed &quot;the error of usurping the role of the democratically accountable decision maker in the formulation of policy&quot;. On Saturday night, the shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: &quot;The government&apos;s policy on illegal immigration seems to be based on headline-grabbing, deliberate controversy and causing offence rather than sensible evidence of what works.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/04/heathrow-retail-outlets-designer-brands", "sentences": ["The new Terminal 2, due to open next June and servicing, among others, the 27 Star Alliance airlines, including US Airways, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, will have a two-level departure lounge lined with shops."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-03T23:05:26Z", "title": "Wait in lounge: how Heathrow cashes in on wealthy time-poor travellers", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Heathrow", "Airline industry", "Burberry", "Business", "Dolce & Gabbana", "Gucci", "Mulberry"], "article": "We nearly all do it: no sooner have we got through airport security than we are into the shops, splashing out on everything from Gucci loafers to headphones, Havaianas and headache pills. At Heathrow alone, 70 million passengers a year with an hour or so to kill add up to serious spending power. So popular are the airport&apos;s shops that last year sales per square foot at its retail outlets hit a staggering \u00a32,782 \u2013 making it one of the most productive shopping destinations in the country. By comparison, Oxford Street&apos;s Selfridges took around \u00a31,500 per square foot in the same period, and Harrods in Knightsbridge a relatively paltry \u00a31,000. Some retailers have known about the power of airports for years \u2013 WH\u00a0Smith&apos;s once near basket-case high street business was helped back to financial health by its airside stores. Dixons&apos; four Heathrow stores are among the five best-performing stores in the company&apos;s portfolio. Average spend per shopper at Heathrow now stands at \u00a338.86, up from \u00a324.68 in 2002, an increase of 57%, while retail sales through the airport have increased 47% in the past decade, to \u00a31.7bn last year. The new Terminal 2, due to open next June and servicing, among others, the 27 Star Alliance airlines, including US Airways, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines, will have a two-level departure lounge lined with shops. Its retail space has proved so popular that there have been five businesses vying for each of the available 69 sites \u2013 52 shops and 17 bars or restaurants. Heathrow management says it has &quot;defined a fresh retail vision&quot; for the shops, which includes concepts like &quot;SoLoMo&quot; \u2013 dedicated &quot;social location mobile&quot; apps to help customers find their way around the stores . Department store group John Lewis will open its first airport store here, selling mainly John Lewis own-brand products and its own designer ranges. Sean Allam, the group&apos;s director of commercial operations, hopes the new outlet will raise the profile of the brand abroad: &quot;We expect the venture to build awareness of the John Lewis brand to target customers in a number of overseas territories, supporting both our online and wholesale business.&quot; Fashion brands such as Mulberry, Dior, Gucci, and many more are finding airport outlets lucrative, thanks to the spending power of wealthy passengers with time on their hands. Muriel Zingraff-Shariff, retail director at Heathrow, explains: &quot;A lot of women business passengers, who come in and out every week, tell us it&apos;s great because while they&apos;re here \u2013 having to be here early \u2013 they can do some shopping, which they never have time to do in town because they&apos;re too busy.&quot; Over in Terminal 5, Nandita Mahtani, a fashion designer heading to Mumbai, is a case in point. She has just left the Tiffany&apos;s store clutching a small bag. She says: &quot;I&apos;ve bought some gifts for friends back home. I knew I would buy something in the airport because I didn&apos;t have time when I was in London.&quot; Around 70% of Heathrow&apos;s passengers are from outside the European Union and it is the airport of choice for international businessmen and women travelling via the UK. Last year spending by tourists from the Bric countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), with their fast-growing, high-spending middle classes, increased by 18%. A walk through Terminal 5 is like a stroll down Paris&apos;s Rue St Honor\u00e9 or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, with Burberry, Bulgari, Smythson and Prada all there. And unlike on the high street, the doors are open, and there are no buzzers or burly security men. Zingraff-Shariff jokes: &quot;If anyone tries to steal anything, they&apos;re not going to get very far in an airport.&quot; Dolce &amp; Gabbana moved in last year, opening its first non-Italian airport store. It replaced a Nokia shop, in a clear sign that the airport and its rich passengers wants more fashion brands. A Mulberry spokesman said the brand&apos;s airport stores were among its best performers. Four of Burberry&apos;s 11 UK stores are in airports, targeting what chief executive Angela Ahrendts calls the travelling luxury consumer. &quot;When Chinese consumers travel,&quot; she said recently, &quot;they spend six times more than when they stay at home \u2026 Saying &apos;I bought this in London&apos; adds cachet.&quot; Heathrow charges retailers a nominal rent but takes a cut of their turnover. Last year, Heathrow made \u00a3542m from retail, according to its annual report, compared with \u00a3329m in 2008. Over at Gatwick, a new shopping area in the South Terminal cost \u00a321m. Here, around 70% of passengers are British holidaymakers rather than businesspeople, and the stores reflect that difference. Instead of the Burberrys or Mulberrys, there are popular high-street brands including Zara, SuperDry and Ted Baker. Spencer Sheen, head of retail at Gatwick, says: &quot;There was underinvestment in the past, and there was pent-up demand from passengers who wanted to start enjoying themselves once they got through security.&quot; Ray Kelvin, chief executive of Ted Baker, says that its airport stores \u2013 in Glasgow and Stansted as well as Gatwick \u2013 had served the business well: &quot;It has helped us to export our brand internationally, as well as servicing the British traveller on last-minute purchases before going on a vacation.&quot; Julian Dunkerton, chief executive of SuperDry, agrees: &quot;We&apos;ve just opened at Gatwick North and it&apos;s going really well. We&apos;re a perfect match for airport crowds with people wanting last minute items before they get away.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/04/nirbhaya-india-women-rape-play", "sentences": ["The female victim \u2013 as yet unnamed \u2013 was hurried by air ambulance to Singapore; on 29 December, she died."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-04T11:00:00Z", "title": "Nirbhaya: the Edinburgh play telling the truth about abuse", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Edinburgh festival 2013", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "India", "Society", "Edinburgh festival", "Culture", "Women", "Life and style"], "article": "On 17 December last year, the playwright and director Yael Farber was at home, opening her laptop, when a news story popped up on her screen. A 23-year-old Indian student and her male friend had been attacked the night before on a bus in Delhi. She had been savagely gang-raped; he was beaten to a pulp. Both were in hospital. In the hours that followed the incident, details rushed in: at least four men were involved, maybe more, among them the bus driver. The couple had been stripped, robbed, left for dead, tossed onto the roadside like rubbish. The woman had been penetrated with a metal rod, which had been removed with such force that it had taken nearly all of her intestines with it. Farber posted a message on Facebook in response. &quot;Normally I find it cheesy when people do that,&quot; she half-smiles. &quot;But I was so moved by it. It just said something like: this could have been my sister, my mother, my daughter, myself.&quot; The next day, the case was headline news, and Indian politicians were scrambling to contain public fury. By midweek, there were tens of thousands of protestors on the streets, calling for an end to a culture of sexual violence and harassment. The female victim \u2013 as yet unnamed \u2013 was hurried by air ambulance to Singapore; on 29 December, she died. Mourners across India wore black. Some pasted black fabric across their mouths. Farber&apos;s message was spotted by a well-known Bollywood actor, Poorna Jagannathan. The pair started talking online about the attack, the protests, what all of it meant. &quot;We were just chatting,&quot; says Farber. &quot;She said \u2013 you know, women are ready to speak about what&apos;s happening right now. You&apos;ve got to come here.&quot; Jagannathan bought Farber and her five-year-old daughter a plane ticket. By early February, they were in a rehearsal room in Mumbai. The piece has just had its fifth public performance at Riverside Studios in west London, before opening at the Edinburgh fringe. It&apos;s called Nirbhaya: Hindi for &quot;fearless&quot;, one nickname the Indian press gave the woman who was attacked, Jyoti Singh Pandey, but also now a symbol of the struggle worldwide against sexual violence. &quot;As soon as the rape happened,&quot; Jagannathan tells me, &quot;there was a huge feeling of complicitness. OK, I may not be perpetuating the violence, but I&apos;m perpetuating the silence. It was about ending that.&quot; &quot;What was it about this case, about her?&quot; Farber asks. &quot;I think it just broke through the endemic numbness that we all develop. Her story was a tipping point, not only for people in India but outside, too. Sometimes a story just cuts through like a scalpel and says: I need to be heard.&quot; Farber, who was born and grew up in Johannesburg, began her career making drama that responds to real events: before her hot-blooded South African adaptation of Strindberg&apos;s Miss Julie, which dominated last year&apos;s festival and is currently on a world tour, one of her best-known pieces was 2001&apos;s Amajuba, a searing play about life under apartheid assembled from the testimony of five survivors. But rarely had she worked with such furious energy. After she put out a Facebook call for women to contribute their own experiences, the cast rapidly fell into place. By day, they talked and rehearsed; by night, Farber honed the material into something that could stand up on stage. &quot;I had to cook it hot and fast,&quot; she says. What became obvious was that the play, in order to do justice to Pandey, would need to contain more than just her story. Hideous though the attack was, it was anything but rare. Delhi is regularly called the &quot;rape capital&quot; of the world; India has been ranked the worst G20 country in which to be a woman; every Indian newspaper carries lurid reports of &quot;Eve-teasing&quot; \u2013 as harassment is dismissively called \u2013 and attacks on women, believed to be increasing. But the problem goes deeper: according to the Indian government&apos;s own stark figures, 53% of Indian children experience sexual abuse. &quot;Nothing happens in isolation,&quot; says Jagannathan. Farber agrees: &quot;When we came together to talk, it was clear that all the women could speak about what they would call typical experiences \u2013 being groped on a train platform, far worse things.&quot; The piece that emerged is as much a series of harrowing personal meditations as a straightforward narrative. One woman describes being abused as a nine-year-old by an Indian Air Force officer. &quot;I learn to leave my body behind,&quot; she says, describing what it&apos;s like to push along a bus, being grabbed at every turn. Another woman is beaten by her father, then suffers marital rape. What makes Nirbhaya exceptional, and at times almost unbearable to watch, is that only two of the seven cast members (Japjit Kaur, who plays Jyoti Singh Pandey, and Ankur Vikal, who plays one of the male attackers) are acting in any straightforward sense. The five other female performers, among them Jagannathan, enact scenes from their own lives \u2013 testimony that&apos;s written with painful obviousness on the features of Sneha Jawale, a &quot;dowry bride&quot; who was doused with kerosene and set alight by her husband, leaving her with severe burns. There&apos;s no doubting the courage of Jawale&apos;s performance: on the night I saw it, I began to wonder whether she&apos;d be able to keep going. Farber is acutely aware of the toll it takes on her cast, and the sensitivity of the issues; she has no desire to co-opt the Nirbhaya case, currently creeping its way through the Indian courts, nor imply that this is an India-only problem (according to the World Health Organisation, although south-east Asia has the highest rate of sexual violence, around one in three women globally experience physical or sexual abuse). &quot;I&apos;m a theatremaker,&quot; she says. &quot;I want to trigger things. I want people having fierce conversations in the bar afterwards, understanding something better or seeing things differently. Opening up, waking up.&quot; But Farber is ardent that their play contains hope as well as fear: optimism about protest, about ending a culture of silence and shame. Seismic changes, she argues, can come from speaking out \u2013 simply from saying, as tens of thousands of men and women did on the streets of India: enough is enough. &quot;The whole idea,&quot; she says, &quot;is that urge to speak. Let it not be a defeat that she died. Let it be this that carries us forward.&quot; Nirbhaya is at Assembly Hall, Edinburgh, until 26 August"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/05/two-thirds-tenants-trapped-inability-buy", "sentences": ["A study by estate agent Knight Frank found nearly three-quarters of new home purchases in inner London were by foreign buyers, mainly from China, Malaysia and Singapore, who expect to let their properties."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-04T23:01:00Z", "title": "Almost two-thirds of tenants 'trapped' by inability to buy home \u2013 survey", "tags": ["Renting property", "First-time buyers", "Housing market", "Rightmove", "Property", "Money", "Business", "UK news", "Mark Carney", "Bank of England", "Interest rates", "Mortgages", "Mortgage rates"], "article": "Almost two-thirds of renters feel trapped because they want to buy a home but cannot afford to do so, according to a survey by the property website Rightmove. The research underlines the frustrations faced by millions locked out of home ownership, dubbed generation rent, as the spiralling cost of letting and a revived property market curb these aspirations. On Wednesday, the Bank of England&apos;s governor, Mark Carney, is expected to outline his plans to keep interest rates low for what could be several years in an effort to build a sustainable recovery. He is also expected to maintain initiatives to keep mortgage costs low, especially the funding for lending scheme credited with boosting demand among first-time buyers. Critics of the policy have claimed that without a surge in housebuilding, low interest rates will push up house prices further, making it harder for renters to save for a deposit on a home. A study by estate agent Knight Frank found nearly three-quarters of new home purchases in inner London were by foreign buyers, mainly from China, Malaysia and Singapore, who expect to let their properties. While the influence of foreign buyers is largely restricted to the capital, the level of new home building is at an 80-year low, restricting the number of homes for sale and rent at a time of rising demand. In the Rightmove survey of 3,000 tenants, 60% say they are unable to get a toehold on the ladder \u2013 an 8% rise since 2011 when the annual survey began. Of these trapped renters, a third had owned a property but decided to sell and return to the rental sector, and now find themselves priced out of the market. The survey also found that one in six of those expecting to buy for the first time this year will be age 40 or over. Despite difficulties, Britons&apos; desire to own a home has not diminished, with 96% of renters surveyed aspiring to this, and seven in 10 saying they would not give up on that dream. Record high rents have made it hard for would-be buyers to build up a big enough deposit to afford a home, despite signs that banks and building societies are becoming more willing to provide higher loan-to-value mortgages. Figures from Nationwide, the UK&apos;s biggest building society, showed house prices rose 3.9% in the year to July, the highest rate since August 2010. The average house price in the UK is now \u00a3170,825, it said. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, said: &quot;Even though some agents are reporting an increase in those buying and escaping the rental trap, the growing number of new households and former homeowners returned to the rental sector keeps producing new tenants. &quot;In spite of buying looking increasingly attractive as the costs of renting continue to rise, saving a deposit continues to get harder. For many of those trapped in rented accommodation and dreaming of escape, it&apos;s a nightmare scenario.&quot; This month the National Housing Federation said house prices in England will soar by 42% by 2020 and rents will rise by even more, warning of the &quot;colossal strain&quot; facing the generation born in the 1990s."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/aug/05/social-value-hybrids-rare-leadership", "sentences": ["Work by civil service colleges in the UK and Singapore is lighting the way here."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-05T07:00:03Z", "title": "The rise of social value hybrids requires a rare blend of leadership", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Public service reform", "Professional development", "Leadership and management", "Policy", "Central government", "Local government", "Public sector careers", "Society Professionals"], "article": "Things used to be so much simpler for public leaders. Governments provided public services, businesses made money, charities addressed the unmet needs that fell through the cracks. Today, things are rather more complicated. In the UK, a whole array of organisations that appear to combine the best of government, business and the social sector have appeared on the public service landscape. From mutuals and community trusts to co-operatives, social enterprises, industrial and provident societies and benefit corporations, new entities that used to be seen as competing imperatives are spinning out of the public sector.. Greenwich Leisure Limited (GLL) is a case in point. Carved out of Greenwich council 20 years ago amid budget cuts, it&apos;s grown to become a sizeable provider of leisure services managing 115 facilities across London and beyond. Rather than being an unhelpful combination, both private and social sector elements have been critical to GLL&apos;s growth. We give GLL and organisations like it the collective term of social value hybrids (SVHs) and explore how they present a strategic option worthy of consideration by public leaders seeking to reconcile fiscal rigour with citizens&apos; expectations and economic growth. Implementing a social value hybrid strategy relies heavily on individuals who possess a rare blend of skills. &quot;You need to find people who have the right mix of managerial skills and entrepreneurial appetite,&quot; says Marg Elliot, founder of leading hybrid Sunderland Home Care Associates. &quot;Getting things done is often more important than process. There aren&apos;t many managers who fit that bill.&quot; It&apos;s not just the organisation that needs to combine social mission with hard-nosed business acumen \u2013 individuals must, too. But in government departments where the policy adviser and the administrator have reigned supreme, how can we develop this new blend of leadership? We have three suggestions: Rethink secondments &quot;Social sabbaticals&quot; play an important part for many multinationals. At Shell, for example, future leaders spend time working in a social enterprise in another part of the world. The skills needed to thrive within a hybrid are best learnt on the job and out of Whitehall \u2013 even if it&apos;s just down the road. They are also most valuable in government&apos;s highest performers. Increasing the competitive tension around winning secondment places would confer greater status and greater potential for career acceleration, getting us beyond older notions of a sabbatical. Rethink training Too many in-service courses are single-sector. The solution? Change the default setting to create cross-sector environments that incubate familiarity, knowledge, networks, skills and ideas. Businesses are facing the equivalent problem, so there should be no shortage of custom. Work by civil service colleges in the UK and Singapore is lighting the way here. More programmes need to follow \u2013 from government and business \u2013 adding breadth and scale. Rethink mentoring It&apos;s time to twin government departments and agencies with existing hybrids. Informal links at all levels \u2013 not just among senior leaders \u2013 could develop into a culture of mutual organisational mentoring. As with town twinning, there need not be much in common at the outset. Of course, there are other ways to help public leaders \u2013 tell us what you think in the comments thread below this article. What seems clear to us is that delivering public services for the future will require a very different skill set from public managers. New practices and entities that combine the best of the public, private and social sectors stand a good chance of becoming the norm. Public leaders need to be ready to be the organisational architects, implementers and social value hybrid chief executives of the future.

It&apos;s difficult to predict the future as libraries exist in a fast changing environment, but one thing seems clear \u2013 the availability and convenient access to a huge volume and variety of digital scholarly content will continue, most of which may lie increasingly outside library walls. Shift in focus In the past, the main role of academic libraries was to provide access to content. Now, however, users are able to access quality content from a variety of other sources. While continuing our role as provider of scholarly content, we need to shift our focus to developing services that incorporate this broader information universe. Limits of open access Like others, our library is likely to continue with costly subscriptions to ejournals and databases to enable our students and faculty to do their work successfully. The current journal subscription model is too entrenched in the scholarly communication process to disappear overnight, even with the rapid growth of open access. Furthermore, not all content can be open access. Digital media such as ebooks have price tags. Libraries continue to play an important role in pooling together a common fund to enable users to access a wide and deep range of publications that no single individual can afford on their own. Open access materials will most likely increase in quantity and play an important role in making publicly-funded research freely available to all. However, it will be a very long time before they can completely satisfy the needs of all disciplines due to incompleteness and cost problems inherent in the both the &apos;green&apos; and &apos;gold&apos; open access routes. What&apos;s more, libraries are still essential for the availability of most open access materials. Green open access depends on libraries continuing their subscriptions so that self-archived publications can be deposited in institutional repositories and made open access. In anticipation of many changes ahead, we formed our scholarly communication group two years ago to keep track of developments and to support academic staff in their engagement in scholarly communication. The group also manages our repository called DR-NTU and a university-wide open access mandate exists. Movements in social media Outside traditional publishing, there is increased use of social media to create useful scholarly content and discourse. Academics who are impatient with the slow peer review process to share and get acknowledgement of their work can take to academic blogging to increase their reach and build their reputations as they wait for citations to their published work to accumulate and their h-indexes to rise. Social media content and the rising interest in altmetrics for measuring impact of scholarship in new media is an area we need to keep close watch on. In preparation for these developments, we set up a group to explore trends in social media and to develop new services. As a start, we initiated the campus-wide blogs@ntu service which helps staff in creating course blogs, research blogs, and marketing blogs. We expect our library staff to be competent in the use of social media to assist our users in this popular information space. There are many new types of scholarly content accumulating in the common digital space including data-sets, videos, audio, maps, and text embedded in tools and applications. Finding information is less of a problem today than selecting appropriate information to use. More choice means that the burden is now on users to be able to discern and select useful information. Librarians guide and teach students in making sense of this complex information environment. They are agents that act on behalf of, and in collaboration with, their users in getting optimal value from the information world, both within and beyond the library. The role of university libraries is not just about providing access to content, but enabling users to learn, make discoveries and develop insights of their own. For this, our concern is with the entire information universe, not just library managed and subscribed content. In the future, this broad approach by libraries will provide more value to our users.

So we have heard a lot about him recently, including the BBC Two series Bill Bailey&apos;s Jungle Hero, an episode of BBC Radio 4&apos;s In Our Time, two episodes of The Infinite Monkey Cage and scores of articles, talks and exhibitions. Wallace deserves more attention but much of what you will have heard about him in the last few months is factually incorrect \u2013 and amounts to a misguided campaign to reinstate the reputation of a genius who (according to his fans) has been wronged by history and robbed of his rightful fame. Since the 1970s, the story of Wallace has become something like this: While Charles Darwin sat on his revolutionary theory for 20 years, terrified of his conservative contemporaries, Wallace boldly set out to solve the great problem of the origin of species. Not afraid to announce unorthodox views, Wallace published a radically innovative theory of evolution (minus only natural selection) in an 1855 paper. Then, while on the island of Gilolo and prompted by thoughts about the local races, Wallace hit on the idea of the struggle for existence and natural selection. He immediately wrote up his theory and posted it to Darwin on the next mail steamer. Darwin, however, withheld the paper for perhaps two weeks before he let it become known. During this time, according to some, Darwin stole some ideas to use in his own otherwise identical theory. Rather than having Wallace&apos;s paper published immediately on its own, which was normal practice at the time, Darwin&apos;s friends cooked up a scheme to rob the working-class Wallace of his priority and instead put their friend Darwin first. Papers by both men were read at a scientific meeting in 1858, but Darwin is remembered as the discoverer of the theory because his contribution was placed first. Swept under the carpet of history The new shelf of sympathetically written books about Wallace tells a pretty consistent story. He is now &quot;forgotten&quot; because he has been unfairly swept under the carpet of history. Why? Because the wealthy and privileged Darwin basks in all the glory of revolutionising our understanding of life on Earth. (Not to mention the back of the \u00a310 note, although Jane Austen is about to boot him off that pedestal). Darwin&apos;s life and works have been meticulously studied by many scholars for over a century. But while some very able scholars have studied Wallace, he by contrast has remained mostly the preserve of amateurs and enthusiasts. There has not been enough progress with our understanding of Wallace because some of the important research projects that have unveiled a treasure trove of new findings about Darwin had never been done for Wallace: his complete works had not been assembled on one scholarly website, his Malay archipelago expedition correspondence had not been collected and edited and his notebooks and journals had not been edited and their contents made intelligible. All of these have recently been done, the latter two not yet published. These new sources have shown us that every substantive claim in the popular narrative about Wallace turns out to be incorrect. \u2022 Wallace was not working class but the son of a gentleman and attended a public school. \u2022 He thought of natural selection on the island of Ternate, not Gilolo. Hence the races there did not inspire his theory. \u2022 He did not send his essay to Darwin on the next steamer, but replied on the following monthly steamer. So Darwin received Wallace&apos;s essay exactly when he said he did. \u2022 Darwin and his friends were not obliged to publish Wallace&apos;s paper, as he had not requested this, but it was acceptable practice at the time for Wallace&apos;s essay to be published without seeking his explicit permission first. \u2022 Darwin did not borrow any idea on evolutionary divergence from Wallace - who in fact had no such theory of his own. And in any case, at the time scientific priority was not settled only by publication, but also by sharing one&apos;s views with colleagues privately. \u2022 Darwin did not keep his belief in evolution secret and he did not postpone publishing because of any fears. But ironically Wallace was afraid to reveal his evolutionary beliefs and carefully concealed them in his published papers. His famous 1855 paper never mentions evolution. What inspired Wallace&apos;s eureka moment? Wallace&apos;s notebooks reveal the gradual development of most of his evolutionary ideas. Far from the story that he set out to discover a mechanism for evolution, Wallace showed no interest in the causes of adaptations. On the contrary, he privately ridiculed traditional ideas of adaptation as evidence of divine design. All this makes his essay proposing natural selection all the more mysterious. For Darwin we have a detailed paper trail revealing the development of his conception of natural selection. For Wallace we only have his published essay. What inspired Wallace&apos;s famous eureka moment in the midst of a malarial fever? There is only one contemporary clue. In a letter written about two weeks later, Wallace mentioned that over the past four years he had found differently coloured tiger beetles on different islands which exactly matched the colour of the sand or mud where they lived. &quot;Such facts as these puzzled me for a long time, but I have lately worked out a theory which accounts for them naturally.&quot; Wallace already believed that new varieties of animals appeared randomly and frequently, the offspring of their parent species. If lots of varieties of various shades are constantly appearing, how does one come to perfectly match the colour of the environment? He remembered the idea of the struggle for existence. The varieties best suited to survive would be those that happened to be the right colour. If the environment slowly changed colour, the parent species might go extinct. One of its daughter varieties could then be well adapted and replace it as the species. It could never revert back to the colour of its parent as that was now inferior. Thus through a struggle for existence, randomly generated variants would be sifted to form new species. It was a brilliant breakthrough. But the real story of Wallace&apos;s contribution is far from the myth of the wronged working class hero. The differences between the Wallace of his modern admirers and the historical Wallace are in fact like the differences between the Jesus of pious Christians and the historical Jesus. Darwin gained nothing from having his paper printed ahead of Wallace&apos;s. Darwin&apos;s fame and reputation, and Wallace&apos;s comparative obscurity, stem from the impact of Darwin&apos;s Origin of Species. As Wallace himself wrote: &quot;this vast, this totally unprecedented change in public opinion has been the result of the work of one man, and was brought about in the short space of twenty years!&quot; Dr John van Wyhe is a historian of science at the National University of Singapore and director of Darwin Online and Wallace Online. His book Dispelling the Darkness: Voyage in the Malay Archipelago and the Discovery of Evolution by Wallace and Darwin is published this month"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/10/chinese-people-smugglers-arrested-spain-france", "sentences": ["In addition to the arrests, police said they had found dozens of fake passports, for countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-10T22:14:10Z", "title": "Chinese people-smugglers arrested in joint Spanish and French raids", "tags": ["Spain", "Crime", "Human trafficking", "Immigration and asylum", "World news", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Law", "UK news", "Europe", "France"], "article": "Joint raids in France and Spain have broken up a sophisticated people-smuggling network being operated throughout Europe that had been transporting Chinese illegal migrants mainly to the UK and US.

According to Spanish police sources the same network, which had been under investigation since 2011, was also implicated in sex trafficking. The gang allegedly used Barcelona as a stopping-off point for illegal migrants while false documents were prepared. In addition to the arrests, police said they had found dozens of fake passports, for countries including Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Singapore. Investigators depicted a complex hierarchical network, consisting of largely independent cells, whose ultimate bosses were based in China. Gang members based in China recruited would-be migrants, and accompanied them throughout the voyage, disguising them as tourists to cross international borders.

It is beloved of homebuilders and furniture stores around the Asia-Pacific region, but, thanks to decades of merciless logging, today only New Guinea holds enough to be harvested in commercial quantities. Verifying that merbau, which fetches about $2,500 a cubic metre on the open market, is genuinely sourced from sustainably forested areas, either in Papua New Guinea or West Papua in Indonesia, gives the conscientious buyer an almighty headache. But it is also proving a boon for wily technology companies. Tracking timber In 2007, Simmonds Lumber, a wholesaler based in Sydney, became the first company in the world to trial a new technology involving DNA sampling and testing. Developed by DoubleHelix, based in Singapore, and certification body Certisource, the technology involves checking wood fibres against the genetic code of trees known to exist in sustainably managed areas. As a business that imports more than 50 containers a month of merbau into the country, mainly from Indonesia, it was essential to ensure that the wood was coming from where its suppliers claimed, explains John Simon, chief executive at Simmonds Lumber. &quot;The trickiest thing about importing from Indonesia is ensuring that the paperwork is correct and not, as we say in Australia, bodged up.&quot; And, at least according to Simon, the Double Helix DNA tracking system provides a higher standard of proof than that offered by either the Forest Stewardship Council or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification, both of which he says focus on auditing company processes, not authenticating individual shipments. However, DNA testing is not the only tracking technology being employed by suppliers and customers keen to ensure that they are not felled by fraud perpetrated by sawmills, factories or traders. Companies such as Track Record and SGS have popped up in recent years to offer software, digital barcoding, radio frequency identification tags and even satellite tracking to corroborate timber batches.     Tracking wood through bar code tags Photograph: Helveta    &quot;Technology can play a real part in proving traceability,&quot; insists Karim Peer, chief executive of Helveta, a firm based in Oxford, which offers a &quot;digital passport&quot; for buyers and sellers. Helveta&apos;s verification system, used in countries such as Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, claims to track a product back to the forest where it began life as a sapling using barcode tags, which are then fixed to the product. The introduction of tough new legislation aimed at combatting the trade in illegally sourced timber \u2013 such as the 2008 amendments to the US Lacey Act, 2012 Illegal Logging Prohibition Act in Australia, and 2010 EU Timber Regulation \u2013 has helped increase the appeal of authentication technologies, Peer says. &quot;The impetus for organisations in Europe and the US is that under the legislation, there are penalties that will be imposed if they don&apos;t comply,&quot; explains Peer. These penalties include criminal convictions, fines and even prison sentences \u2013 a sobering thought for a wholesaler or retailer who might have otherwise drawn comfort from their wilful ignorance of the supply chain. Tackling the fraudsters While new technologies may offer promise, neither the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) nor PEFC currently mandate that their members adopt them. According to Jonathan Geach, executive director of Double Helix, this leaves their chain-of-custody systems open to abuse, which he says act more like an &quot;honour system&quot; based on trust. The access to markets and suppliers that FSC or PEFC certification offers creates a &quot;perverse incentive&quot; for fraudsters to cheat the system, adds Geach. &quot;FSC is very good at making sure that forests are well run, but, once a product gets out of a forest, you have myriad middle men and traders,&quot; Geach says. &quot;Factories that sell certified products also sell uncertified products alongside. Now it doesn&apos;t take much imagination to see that they may be mixing and through that laundering.&quot; However, to accuse the FSC or PEFC of being blind to the opportunities presented by technology would be unfair. Phil Guillery, systems integrity director for FSC International, explains that his organisation is already embarking on a project with Historic Futures, another British IT firm, to develop an online claims platform to verify the certification status of FSC suppliers. &quot;As the FSC has grown to cover almost every product from maple syrup to wood furniture \u2013 from the B&amp;Qs and Ikeas of this world to small operations \u2013 [we have found that] the paper-based system we created needs to be modernised,&quot; Guillery says. DNA technology is under consideration, Guillery acknowledges, but he expresses reservations about its limitations. &quot;At this point, the cost effectiveness and the science aren&apos;t quite there,&quot; he says. &quot;You can&apos;t do testing on paper or lots of composite wood products because the DNA is generally removed. For some tropical species, there are many closely related relatives, which also makes it difficult.&quot; For all this focus on technology, there is a danger that companies may not see the wood for the trees, so to speak, at least when it comes to other important issues related to sustainable forest management. &quot;I don&apos;t see how a DNA test will guarantee that workers in Malaysia or China or anywhere have their freedom of association or bargain rights honoured. I don&apos;t see how barcoding will guarantee that forest workers come home at night with the body parts that they left with in the morning,&quot; says Bill Street, chairman of PEFC&apos;s board of directors. &quot;The goal, at least for PEFC, is that we put an end to deforestation and that requires focusing on a much larger picture than just technology.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

She was brought back to shake some life into the brand, which was the first clothing range to be sold by a supermarket, and has since aligned George with Graduate Fashion Week. &quot;It was scary,&quot; Lambert admits. &quot;I was brought back to have an opinion and to make a difference, and I had very strong views about what we could do with the brand. It was the first chance I&apos;ve had in my career to really put my head above the parapet \u2013 a situation where you&apos;re either going to sink or swim based on your success.&quot; Fortunately, her plan worked, and Asda has since opened stand-alone George stores in Singapore and Malta, with plans to expand further later this year. The brand&apos;s sponsorship of Graduate Fashion Week, which began in 2011, has seen collaborations with young designers across the range, and has helped to give the supermarket collection a catwalk edge. It&apos;s clear that helping the next generation of fashion graduates to explore different career paths is something Lambert has a passion for. &quot;I did my degree in fashion, but I didn&apos;t really know what the options were when I came out. I just knew I loved fashion,&quot; she says. &quot;One of the things we want to do is talk to students a lot younger \u2013 at 15 and 16 \u2013 because I was naive about the career choices that were available to me. We need to speak to people about the digital side or systems development \u2013 skills that people think are more traditionally male. We need to talk to students earlier so there&apos;s not such a stereotypical view of certain businesses.&quot; Fashion is a notoriously competitive field, so does it have a problem with stereotyping? Lambert isn&apos;t convinced. &quot;I&apos;ve never experienced sexism myself,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to say that&apos;s down to the industry I work in, but we&apos;ve got a predominantly female customer base, and you have got to really know your customers because that makes you good at your job. Is that a more male or female trait? I don&apos;t know.&quot; She hesitates when the subject of quotas comes up, explaining that she hopes good business practice will eliminate the need for them altogether. She adds that helping staff to make better decisions through mentoring schemes is a good place to start, and something Asda does well. Lambert has had mentors throughout her own career, but she says it is vital to understand who you need at each stage. &quot;I worked with a lovely lady called Frances Mossman at Next, who was a great support to me at the beginning of my career. When I went from design into buying, she mentored me through the right choices for me. More recently, I had an external coach. To have someone who&apos;s available, who can give you advice from an experienced viewpoint does really help.&quot; So has she had some career wobbles? Moments where she thought about packing it all in? &quot;I didn&apos;t have any moments where I thought I couldn&apos;t do it, but taking this job was one of those things where you say this is just down to me and the reality is you can use your mentors and talk stuff through. Ultimately, though, you&apos;re making the decision. I didn&apos;t have any doubts I was doing the right thing,&quot; she adds, &quot;but I remember giving myself a bit of a talking-to saying, &apos;You want this and you&apos;re going to have to make the decision because this is what you wanted.&apos;&quot; Her favourite maxim, she says, is that you can&apos;t lead from a crowd. &quot;You have to believe in yourself. That&apos;s the advice I would give to people, to believe in yourself because during that little wobble, that moment of self-doubt, you need to have the courage of your convictions to just get on with it.&quot; Sign up to become a member of the Women in Leadership community here for more comment, analysis and best practice direct to your inbox."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/17/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-formula-one", "sentences": ["That is followed by Singapore, where again Hamilton was in dominant form last season before his McLaren betrayed him."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-17T15:47:01Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes look to pick up where they left off", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One 2013", "Mercedes GP", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;We&apos;ve gone on holiday by mistake,&quot; says Richard E Grant&apos;s Withnail in that wonderful black comedy Withnail and\u00a0I, and one senses that Ross Brawn, the Mercedes team principal, feels rather the same way. While the summer sabbatical feels like a lifesaver for many in the hectically scheduled, vroom and bust world of Formula One, its timing was less than ideal for a Mercedes team that appeared to be gathering a menacing momentum in the weeks leading up to the break. Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg are the strongest drivers&apos; pairing in the paddock. And now that they have the quickest car too, at least over one lap, they look the most likely to threaten Red Bull&apos;s hegemony in the second half of the season. With three wins and four pole positions in the past five races, the Mercedes WO4 is second to Red Bull in the constructors&apos; championship. And if Hamilton can reproduce the intensity of his weekend at the Hungaroring at the end of July at the very different Spa circuit next Sunday, when F1 racing returns, he will emerge as the most credible challenger for Sebastian Vettel&apos;s individual crown. In fourth place, 48 points behind Vettel with nine races to go, he may look like an outsider but at his best, and when given the right equipment, Hamilton is too much of a handful for anyone, including the current world champion. His difficulty will be in matching Vettel&apos;s staggering level of consistency, but the next three tracks glitter with promise for him. The fast Spa-Francorchamps circuit, with some of the best corner sections in the sport, is a drivers&apos; track, and no one drives quite like Hamilton, who won here in 2010. Two weeks later comes Monza, the quickest of them all, and Hamilton won here, heroically, last year. That is followed by Singapore, where again Hamilton was in dominant form last season before his McLaren betrayed him. &quot;I&apos;m really looking forward to the second half; that is usually my favourite part,&quot; he says. &quot;I can honestly say I feel just so invigorated, it&apos;s so refreshing to be somewhere new. I hope there&apos;s a world championship somewhere ahead. That&apos;s what I&apos;m working for every year, that&apos;s why I keep that discipline, that&apos;s why I train so much over the winter, that&apos;s why I wake up every day and train. &quot;That&apos;s why I put so much effort into travelling and that&apos;s why you sacrifice so many small things, certain things in your life, and so I hope at some stage I get that second world championship.&quot; Brawn, too, is optimistic about the races ahead. &quot;We&apos;ll have a much more respectable second half,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ve scored more points already than we did last year, and we&apos;re just over halfway through. We&apos;ve got a strong enough organisation to ensure we won&apos;t let it slip. We&apos;re on a journey here with Lewis and we don&apos;t know where the limits are.&quot; Everyone, including Mercedes, will be taking a long hard look at the tyres at Spa. The new Pirelli tyre, a combination of the 2012 construction and the 2013 compound, uses Kevlar composite instead of steel in its construction. It added up to some cool running in Hungary. But the Hungaroring circuit is not dissimilar to Monaco in some respects. It is certainly not a representative track. After Spa, where the tyres will be tested by higher lateral forces, we will all have a much better idea where these wheels are taking us. Red Bull, with Vettel enjoying a 38-point lead over second-placed Kimi Raikkonen, are still the team to beat, and they are unlikely to implode under pressure. Ferrari are expected to bring meaningful improvements to Spa, and they need to because they have been going backwards in recent races. The fourth biggest team this year has been Lotus. Everyone says they have not got the money to keep up with the leading three teams, but Raikkonen&apos;s consistency has been remarkable. The next few weeks will shape not only the two world championships but also the driver line-ups for next year, with Mark Webber&apos;s approaching retirement opening up a number of possibilities. The Red Bull seat is still likely to go to Daniel Ricciardo or Raikkonen, despite links with Fernando Alonso. But Alonso&apos;s team-mate, Felipe Massa, is under familiar pressure. There will be no changes at Mercedes or McLaren, though Sergio P\u00e9rez&apos;s recent description of his McLaren car as &quot;complicated, difficult and inconsistent&quot; is not exactly what the team wanted to hear on their 50th anniversary."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/19/edwards-group-swedish-british-atlas-copco", "sentences": ["It has offices all over the world, including China, Singapore, Argentina and the US."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-19T19:01:48Z", "title": "Swedish firm Atlas Copco buys British with Edwards Group acquisition", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Business", "Sweden", "Europe", "Jaguar Land Rover", "Automotive industry", "World news"], "article": "Edwards Group has become the latest British manufacturing business to be acquired by a foreign rival after Sweden&apos;s Atlas Copco bought the company in a $1.6bn (\u00a31bn) deal. The takeover comes less than a month after Invensys, one of the last survivors from the era of British industrial conglomerates, agreed to a \u00a33.4bn takeover by France&apos;s Schneider Electric. Edwards, the market leader in vacuum pumps for the chemical and semiconductor industries, is an international success, with a third of its income generated from the US and more than half from Asia. Atlas Copco&apos;s chief executive, Ronnie Leten, said: &quot;It&apos;s a $6bn market, and it is still growing. This project is a real growth project. Of course, there are cost synergies, but the main driving factor for us is to create synergies within sales and services from compressors and vacuums.&quot; Atlas Copco is one of Sweden&apos;s biggest industrial companies, but it has suffered recently owing to its exposure to the mining sector. Analysts said acquiring Edwards, which based in Crawley, West Sussex, would reduce Atlas Copco&apos;s share of earnings from mining and rock excavation products. Edwards is co-controlled by two private equity groups, CCMP and Unitas Capital. Like Invensys, Edwards has a long history and has been in business for nearly 100 years. However, as its strong links to the US and Asian markets show, the company has now taken on an international dimension. It has offices all over the world, including China, Singapore, Argentina and the US. It floated on the Nasdaq exchange in New York in 2012. Invensys, which develops computer systems for refineries and chemical and nuclear plants, was created by the merger of two industrial conglomerates, BTR and Siebe. However, as the Schneider and Atlas Copco deals show, a corporate trend appears to be re-emerging for UK businesses to become part of larger industrial groups. Analysts touted the Edwards deal as a diversification of Atlas Copco, adding another unit to the Scandinavian group. &quot;It is something which is quite clear that Atlas has intended to do: expand its business in surrounding disciplines,&quot; said Peter Frolen, an analyst at Handelsbanken. &quot;This is going to generate revenue and cost synergies.&quot; Atlas Copco said it would pay up to $10.50 a share for Edwards, including net debt, representing a 24% premium to Friday&apos;s closing price of $8.45. Edwards, whose competitors include Japan&apos;s Ebara and Gardner Denver in the US, employs more than 3,200 people in 20 countries and had revenues of \u00a3595m pounds in 2012, or about 7% of Atlas&apos;s sales. The most high-profile non-UK ownership of British industrial businesses is in car manufacturing, with Mini, Bentley and Jaguar Land Rover all in foreign hands."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/20/gary-bolton-jailed-seven-years-fake-bomb-detectors", "sentences": ["Gary Bolton, 47, hawked the bogus kit to military and police clients in countries including Mexico, Thailand, Pakistan, China, India, the Philippines, Singapore, Egypt and Tunisia despite it being based on a novelty golf ball finder."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-20T10:14:00Z", "title": "Kent businessman jailed for seven years over fake bomb detectors", "tags": ["Crime", "UK news"], "article": "A Kent businessman who made up to \u00a33m a year from the sale of fake bomb detectors around the world has been jailed for seven years by a judge at the Old Bailey. Gary Bolton, 47, hawked the bogus kit to military and police clients in countries including Mexico, Thailand, Pakistan, China, India, the Philippines, Singapore, Egypt and Tunisia despite it being based on a novelty golf ball finder. The devices cost as little as \u00a31.82 to make and were sold for as much as \u00a315,000. They remain in use in Thailand, where human rights campaigners claim they have cost lives, and were only abandoned by Mexican agencies in 2011. Sentencing him on two counts of making and selling an article for use in fraud over a period of five years, Mr Justice Hone said: &quot;The culpability and harm of what you were doing is at the highest level because when used for the detection of explosives, in my judgment the use of the GT200, albeit in conjunction with other detectors, did materially increase the risk of personal injury and death.&quot; Human rights campaigners in Thailand, where the devices were widely used by the army and police, have identified two fatal bombings that killed four people and injured more after the device was used to check suspicious vehicles.     Devices sold by Gary Bolton.  Photograph: PA    Bolton&apos;s sentence follows that of his former business partner Jim McCormick, who was jailed for 10 years in May for selling around \u00a350m worth of similar devices, many to postwar Iraq where their use is thought to have cost lives. Speaking in mitigation, Jonathan Higgs QC said Bolton had three children, including a eight-month-old baby, and had been diagnosed with depression. The court heard that branches of the UK government had offered some support to Bolton&apos;s enterprise, called Global Technical. They include UKTI, Whitehall&apos;s export sales arm, and the British embassy in Mexico, which from 2005 to 2009 offered support though introductions to potential clients and allowed Bolton&apos;s firm to use its premises for demonstrations. &quot;You have damaged the reputation of British trade abroad, having duped UKTI and other agencies dedicated to supporting the export of quality British goods as opposed to the dross that you manufactured,&quot; said the judge. The jury heard that Bolton&apos;s devices were &quot;nothing more than a box with a handle and antennae attached to it and pieces of plastic inside it&quot;. The charges related to a period from 2007 to 2012, but Bolton began marketing the device in 2000 demonstrating it in Malta, Egypt, Uganda and South Africa. In 1999 the Royal Engineers exports support team tested a version of the invention, at Bolton&apos;s request, but the army unit found it to be accurate only around 30% of the time, the court heard. Bolton went on to doctor the reports to make them appear a clear vindication of the science he claimed was behind the device. A version of the report, seen by the Guardian, claims the detector &quot;looks for the atomic structure of the substance and once located locks on giving its location&quot;. It &quot;operates by the generation of static electricity within the body, which sets up a field around the searcher, activating the unit and making it attract to the substance&quot;. Bolton claimed that his detectors worked with a range of 766 yards at ground level and from as far as 2.5 miles in the air and said they were effective through lead-lined and metal walls, water, containers and earth. Bolton&apos;s sales pitch boasted of detecting explosives, narcotics, ivory, tobacco and even money. The prosecutor Richard Whittam QC told the jury when arrested in July 2012 Bolton &quot;said he had no background in science, research, training or specifically security&quot;. During the trial Bolton called in his defence an expert in dowsing, a method of &quot;divining&quot; for water using sticks. It has taken more than 16 years for the law to catch up with Bolton. Tests in 2001 proved the detectors performed no better than random in searches for explosives. \u2022 This article was amended on Tuesday 20 August 2013 to remove a reference to Global Technology Limited.

Ashok Vaswani, who has a key role in a new management team charged with altering the culture at the scandal-hit bank, says: &quot;If you are not humble you cannot learn. It is a core value that drives me a lot.&quot; Sitting in a meeting room above a busy branch on Borough high street, London, the 52-year-old is keen to get across the message that he wants to put customers at the heart of everything done by himself and his 30,000 branch staff across the UK. He describes the data recording complaints against the bank as horrendous. There were 381,740 complaints in the first six months of this year. He insists, though, he is cutting out problems such as requirements for customers to send faxes and inform the bank of their travel plans to be able to use a credit card abroad. In the last six months of 2012 Barclays was the most complained about bank in Britain \u2013 by some measures with more than 400,000 complaints. &quot;I want to put the company out there to say we are totally committed to driving these complaints down,&quot; Vaswani said. Referring to Barclays&apos; slogan promoting itself as the &quot;go to&quot; bank \u2013 a line devised by his boss, Antony Jenkins, after he was promoted to chief executive in the wake of the Libor scandal, \u2013 Vaswani said: &quot;What is &apos;go to&apos;? Antony would say it was an emotional connectiveness to the brand. You can&apos;t build emotional connectiveness with a brand if you&apos;ve got so many complaints.&quot; Vaswani joined Barclays in 2010. He knew Jenkins from their work at the vast US banking empire of Citigroup. His arrival in London three years ago came through a globe trotting career with Citi that began when he left India for Dubai in 1987. He arrived in the Middle East with just $14 in his pocket and met the India-born daughter of a client whom he later married. Their daughter was born in Dubai. From there he went to Turkey, Brussels, New York and Singapore, then back to New York. No sooner had he arrived in London than he was running Barclays&apos; African operations. He gained his current role, that of running 1,577 UK branches, and 797 branches elsewhere in Europe, by stepping into Jenkins&apos; shoes when he moved up from retail chief to the top job. He got a Singaporean passport after falling in love with the island city state while running Citi&apos;s Asian operations, a career route that left him returning to New York 15 times a year to visit his wife and daughter who preferred to stay in the US. During the banking crisis, when Citi incurred heavy losses, he was working in private equity with former colleagues from Citi before returning to banking again with Barclays. He says he now intends to publish Barclays&apos; complaints data every three months, twice as often as required by the Financial Conduct Authority, and to outline the key causes of complaints. Payment protection insurance has been a leading cause of customer anger, and has cost Barclays \u00a34bn. The bank had 381,740 complaints in the first six months of the year. Vaswani would rather focus on the numbers without PPI, where complaints were down 46% to 91,215 in the first six months of the year. Vaswani is keen on digital banking, technology and social media. He has ruled out job cuts. As a member of the executive committee he finds his pay does not need to be disclosed. It seems likely he receives about \u00a32m a year. He admits that, as &quot;for any normal person, money is important&quot; but what motivates him, he says, is his desire to improve the banking culture. In a lecture this year to the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies he defined culture as being about &quot;how you behave when no one else is looking&quot;. It a definition that was used by Bob Diamond, the former Barclays CEO ousted during the Libor scandal, and Vaswani admitted that culture could be hard to instil across a large workforce. &quot;This is about looking at the end of the assignment, looking at myself in the mirror and saying I was a trustee for a great company and a great franchise and I did everything humanly possible to make it a better franchise [for the successor],&quot; he says. An only child, his mother, an Indian government official, was his main motivator after his father, a businessman, died when he was six. If his father had lived longer his career path could have been different, he suggests. But it was his mother, he says, who encouraged humility, and it was the opening of his mind to learning that &quot;was the huge thing&quot; she gave him."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/21/compulsory-voting-good", "sentences": ["Australia is one of only 10 countries in the world that enforce compulsory voting, and one of only two majority-English-speaking countries to do so, alongside our neighbour Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-21T02:55:18Z", "title": "Of course compulsory voting is a good thing | Van Badham", "tags": ["Australia news", "US news", "Politics", "Coalition", "Tony Abbott"], "article": "Australia is one of only 10 countries in the world that enforce compulsory voting, and one of only two majority-English-speaking countries to do so, alongside our neighbour Singapore. It&apos;s a policy that activates loud bleating of complaint from the neo-libertarian crowd. Their opposition to compulsory voting is usually expressed in the identical vocabulary of waaaaaaaaaaah as their resistance to wearing seatbelts, educating their children with other people&apos;s children, not plastering stores&apos; shelves with titty-porn, and being told they really shouldn&apos;t smoke in front of a baby. Compulsory voting is also opposed by politicians keen to attack it for partisan advantage. As recently as the last Liberal government in 2004, the infernal former Liberal senator Nick Minchin had to be stopped from within his own party from removing a provision that has been our nation&apos;s democratic backbone for 89 years. We can all be grateful that, at least in this instance, everyone&apos;s favourite Liberal-of-last-resort, Petro Georgiou, found a flaming sword of sufficient brightness to banish Satan back to his cave. Liberals of Minchin&apos;s ilk have realpolitik reasons to campaign against compulsory voting. In the vast majority of countries where voting is optional \u2013 especially the liberal democratic states of the West most demographically similar to our own \u2013 it&apos;s a long established fact that voting turnout is massively concentrated amongst those communities with higher levels of education, urbanity, wealth, health, control of their own time and the other privileges of inherited social capital. The voters\u00a0who tend to vanish are, of course, poor, isolated, minimally educated, sick, low-paid, casualised or vulnerable. In other words, those with the least to gain from a party like Minchin&apos;s, which has an electoral appeal focused on the connected rich and those believing they may yet will be so. Compulsory voting was not the initiative of city-slicking socialists, but a Nationalist Party MP in a Coalition government \u2013 Herbert Payne, a backbench senator from Tasmania. His private members&apos; bill posted on 16 July 1924 was in response to low voter turnout in the 1922 election, in which only slightly less than 60% of eligible Australians cast a vote. It was voted up unanimously by all members in both houses in less than an hour, and made into law within a fortnight. Australia has maintained a 90%+ voter turnout and arguably the most enfranchised Washminster democracy in the world ever since. What made the early parliament of this country unanimous in its support of compulsory voting wasn&apos;t that it lacked a right-wing libertarian fraction devoted to the cause of dressing like the sidekicks on Jackass, pig shooting in national parks and whinging to Twitter &quot;because freedom&quot; if they can&apos;t buy MILF mags at a petrol station. It was the understanding that compulsory voting isn&apos;t so much about the state making the people vote, but the people making the state accountable for enabling universal access to the vote. While voting remains compulsory, that the whole nation is obliged to go to the polls, so must the polls go \u2013 physically and practically \u2013 to the whole nation. This is why, unlike other countries, we have simple electoral enrolment procedures, voting on weekends, easily-organised postal-voting, ballot boxes in nursing homes and hospitals, an independent electoral commission, and a system that must consistently identify and remove obstacles to voting. In countries where voting is optional, even a democratic state has no such obligation to enfranchise its citizenry. That &quot;not having enough time&quot; to vote is the single biggest reason citizens of other Western democracies don&apos;t make it to the polls is exactly why voting is held on working days in some countries, with districts potentially hostile to a ruling party&apos;s electoral fortunes subject to extraordinary suppression efforts. In the year 2000, for example, thousands of citizens living in a democracy \u2013 most of them belonging to a racial minority \u2013 were wrongly added to a &quot;scrub list&quot; and\u00a0were never added to voting rolls.\u00a0This wasn&apos;t Croatia with its recent 20.74%\u00a0turnout, but the US state of Florida during the Bush v Gore election. The controversy is rumbling on: Florida&apos;s current Republican governor has recently asked\u00a0to resume a fiercely contested &quot;voter purge&quot; \u2013 a move which has been described as a partisan attack on Hispanic and Democratic voters. In the same vein, this week the US state of North Carolina passed &quot;the mother of all voter suppression bills&quot;. Amongst myriad active disenfranchisements to voting, ID checks have become stricter, the early voting used by up to 70% of African-American voters in 2012 has been cut off a week early, local election boards have lost their power to keep polls open to deal with crowds, and any voter who by accident votes in the wrong precinct will have their whole vote discounted. Compulsory voting is the Australian guarantee of voter freedom, not its opposite. The law is only that you have to place a collected piece of paper into an envelope or box. You are not obliged to vote for a political party or candidate \u2013 one wag whose vote I scrutineered in an election once wrote &quot;all the candidates are dickheads&quot; with a big tick and walked away, fine-free. That you have the right to this is yearned for even in other democracies where mere access to a polling place is not ensured. Dinner party psephologists who bang on about how they shouldn&apos;t be obliged to turn up to the polls may do well to consider what it must be like to have fought slavery and Jim Crow laws for the right to vote, and then be denied through legal voter suppression the opportunity to exercise it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/aug/23/lets-move-to-old-felixstowe-suffolk", "sentences": ["And, from its surviving bone structure, it was (and is, more or less) rather an elegant place: an infinite column of beach huts, those municipal rockery gardens you find at the better seasides, and boulevards of Edwardian semis, all verandas and Singapore slings."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-23T15:30:01Z", "title": "Let's move to Old Felixstowe, Suffolk", "tags": ["Property", "Homes", "Money", "Life and style"], "article": "What&apos;s going for it?

The pace of reduction in asset purchases from the current rate of $85bn-a-month will be gradual. It will depend on economic conditions. Nothing is predetermined. Yet the yield on 10-year Treasuries has surged from 1.7% at the start of May to 2.8%, helping to stoke a storm in developing economies that is starting to look very dangerous. Hot money is flowing out of Asia and Latin America, pushing up effective interest rates in economies where rates of growth had started to slow anyway. The Indonesian rupiah has fallen 11% against the US dollar in the past three months. The Indian rupee is off 13% in the same period. Brazil, which two years ago was grumbling about global &quot;currency wars&quot; and the difficulties presented by an appreciating real, is now confronting the opposite problem: the real has fallen 16% against the dollar in three months. Much more of this, and we&apos;re looking at a proper crisis. There are two main ways the tale could develop from here. A cheery plot line would see some of the currency interventions, such as Brazil&apos;s, succeed in providing a brake. Investors might reflect that a gentle adjustment would deliver some long-term global benefits. As Singapore&apos;s finance minister argued, it&apos;s in nobody&apos;s interests that ultra low interest rates continue indefinitely if they just reinforce financial imbalances. It&apos;s the rate of adjustment that matters and \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 most Asian countries are better equipped than in 1997 and 1998 to fight back. Back then, their foreign reserves were tiny. By and large, the reverse is true this time. The Fed could also lend a hand by emphasising \u2013 again \u2013 its flexibility. As Nick Parsons, strategist at National Australia Bank, puts it, the Fed may be withdrawing the punch bowl but it will be serving mojitos: it is conceivable that US interest rates will stay at 0.25% for several years yet. The alternative \u2013 and gloomy \u2013 script would involve the crisis starting to feed on itself. A pile of foreign reserves is a handy weapon in a currency crisis but it&apos;s a weapon that, once deployed, has to be seen to work. India is top of the worry list. Capital controls and market interventions have had little effect so far. They have merely encouraged alarm among foreign investors who are required to fund the yawning budget deficit. Meanwhile the worry \u2013 not just in India \u2013 is that big companies have borrowed too heavily in dollars, a recipe for pain. And what would follow a serious crisis in India, such as a call for assistance from the IMF? In the 1997-98 crisis there was a domino effect as Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and Indonesia were sucked in. What we know about today&apos;s global economy is that it&apos;s even more interconnected. Which way will the tale go? A muddling through is probably still the safer bet on the grounds that the economies of the US and parts of Europe appear to be recovering. That&apos;s the fundamentally bullish reason why a US exit from QE is in prospect. But a confident forecast? No. QE was a grand monetary experiment. We just don&apos;t know how withdrawal will play out. BHP was right to cut bonuses     Andrew Mackenzie. Photograph: David Gray/Reuters    Dear remuneration committee, I know you&apos;ve docked my share bonus award by \u00a33m but I don&apos;t think you&apos;ve gone far enough. I&apos;m topping it up to \u00a34m. I am, after all, a chief executive who stands for discipline on costs. Andrew Mackenzie, the new boss at BHP Billiton, will not, of course, go hungry. His 2008 share scheme, a combination of a regular award plus a buyout of his package from former employer Rio Tinto, will still pay out \u00a34.6m, which is not a bad return given what has happened to BHP&apos;s share price over the five years since 2008. Shareholders are 9.4% worse off in dollar terms, even when dividends are added back. That performance, remarkably, was still good enough (or not bad enough) to place BHP at the top of the tree among mining brethren. The rest of the bunch clocked up a total shareholder return of minus 44% on average from 2008. Thus BHP stumbled towards its target of outperforming the opposition by 5.5% a year. Its returns went backwards \u2013 but not at the rate experienced by the main rivals, such as Rio, Xstrata and Anglo American, who variously blew up their performance statistics with rights issues and dividend cuts in 2009. In the circumstances BHP&apos;s pay committee was right to slice 35% off awards to all executives; it would have been too embarrassing to pay out full jackpots. Mackenzie&apos;s voluntary top-up is also sensible. What the saga really demonstrates, not for the first time, is how the mining industry paid its executives as if they were geniuses in the go-go years, rather than the fortunate beneficiaries of a huge bull market in commodities. A &quot;downwards rebasing&quot; of remuneration is under way at BHP \u2013 a good thing, too. As for the \u00a3170m retention award that Xstrata thought its top 70 executives deserved to share after the merger with Glencore, it looks more shameless than ever. Who&apos;s best for RBS?     Andrew Higginson. Photograph: Mark Pinder    Who should we be cheering in the grand RBS branch sale? None of the would-be bidders currently trotting around the parade ring has managed to generate a buzz. The three consortiums tend to sound roughly like each other. If somebody has a distinctive trading strategy for the 315 branches to be rebadged as Williams &amp; Glyn&apos;s, it&apos;s hard to spot. There have been vague pledges to be a community-based bank and so forth, but that&apos;s about it. Never mind, we can only pick from the available field. This column&apos;s provisional vote goes to W&amp;G Investments, the vehicle led by former Tesco finance director Andrew Higginson, for two reasons. First, it&apos;s backed by a decent collection of investors who tend to stay for the long-haul \u2013 such as Schroders (with a 16% stake), Threadneedle (15%) and hedge fund Lansdowne (10%). Second, the structure of its proposal looks the most straightforward. The Corsair/Centerbridge and Anacap/Blackstone consortiums are really offering to provide RBS with some cornerstone capital ahead of a later flotation. W&amp;G, by contrast, wants a quick and clean purchase at book value, estimated to be \u00a31.5bn. That looks the easiest way to give a (very mild) boost to competition, which after all is what the sale process is meant to be about.     Steve Ballmer. Photograph: Rex Features    Microsoft goodbyes and share rise hellos Goodbye Steve Ballmer, hello to a rising share price. That was the market&apos;s snap reaction to the departure of the unloved (at least by Wall Street) Microsoft chief executive. The initial jump was 8%, which is going some for a company that big. Is the implied damning judgment on Ballmer&apos;s 13-year reign fair? It&apos;s certainly true that the PC company has been comprehensively outsmarted by Apple and Google in most of its adventures into consumer markets. On the other hand, profits have more than doubled on his watch and Windows and Office are still huge cash generators. The real question is whether a change at the top implies better days. Two factors might make the market rethink its easy confidence. First, Ballmer could still be in post for up to a year as there&apos;s no obvious successor. Second, the timing of his departure, soon after a strategic relaunch, may suggest the board of Microsoft is not agreed on where the business should be concentrating its resources. There could be a lot of muddle before clarity emerges."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/aug/25/eleanor-wake-obituary", "sentences": ["As a child Ele lived in Hong Kong and Singapore, where her father was pilot in the RAF."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-25T13:08:46Z", "title": "Eleanor Wake obituary", "tags": ["Mexico", "Christianity", "History", "Spain"], "article": "My friend and colleague Eleanor Wake, who has died of cancer aged 64, was one of the world&apos;s leading scholars of early colonial Mexico. Ele was 40 when she embarked on a PhD on this topic, which formed the basis of her book Framing the Sacred: The Indian Churches of Early Colonial Mexico in 2010. The idea that the many imposing stone churches built by the Christianised Indians of 16th-century Mexico incorporated aspects of Aztec imagery was not new, but Ele demonstrated, with boundless energy and passion, that this is to approach the subject from the wrong direction: rather than manifestations of Christianised Mexico, these churches represent how Christianity was Mexicanised. At one level it is true that the new churches reflected the expectations of the missionary friars but, much more significantly, they also conformed to entirely Indian religious beliefs, each deliberately embedded within the traditional sacred geography of its locality. Ele proved this with scrupulous field and archival work. She travelled extensively in central and southern Mexico, studying around 300 early colonial churches, photographing them and calculating their orientation. She found that they were often precisely aligned with significant features in the landscape, and that their richly carved and painted surfaces included innumerable examples of previously overlooked glyphs and motifs referring to Aztec religion \u2013 maize, rabbits, the sun, moon and stars, flowers associated with ritual singing, ritual foods \u2013 and to hallucinogenic substances. Her earlier life does not easily explain this passion for colonial Mexico. As a child Ele lived in Hong Kong and Singapore, where her father was pilot in the RAF. She did well at school but turned down a place at university in favour of a bilingual English/Spanish secretarial course. In the early 1970s, she lived in Madrid (there are unconfirmed rumours that she was involved in a pop group) after which she worked in the purser&apos;s office on the QE2, where her main responsibility seems to have been to organise flights home for passengers who found a round-the-world cruise too tedious. In the 1980s she changed tack, moving to Rome to work in the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, where she specialised in development projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. And then to the University of Essex, where after a degree in Latin American studies and an MA in Latin American government and politics, she moved over to art history for her PhD (which I supervised). With hindsight, there is perhaps some logic here: her enjoyment of travel, her fluency in Spanish and her impatience with disciplinary or cultural boundaries of any kind laid the groundwork for her all-too-brief career as a researcher and academic."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/25/sebastian-vettel-wins-f1-belgian-grand-prix", "sentences": ["After a little consideration of his efforts on the fast and stunning Spa-Francorchamps circuit, he gathered himself to point out that Mercedes would be more competitive in Singapore next month."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-25T16:22:00Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel wins F1's Belgian Grand Prix to strengthen title hold", "tags": ["Formula One 2013", "Sebastian Vettel", "Red Bull", "Lewis Hamilton", "Fernando Alonso", "Jenson Button", "Mark Webber", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "The Greenpeace activists who attempted to disrupt the Belgian Grand Prix might have been protesting against Red Bull spoiling the Formula One season as a meaningful contest. Whatever the post-race protestations from team principal Christian Horner that there were still eight races and a long way to go, Sebastian Vettel knew better. He did not say so, of course but after the German&apos;s cantering victory had extended his lead in the championship to 46 points, he swigged thirstily from his podium champagne bottle, like a toper who has heard the pub&apos;s closing bell That was unusual, for him, and reflected, simultaneously, his feelings of relief and latent celebration; a fourth title beckons and an extension to his astonishing, almost Schumacher-like hegemony. Meanwhile, one of his two most likely challengers, Lewis Hamilton, who was third, wore a forlorn, the game&apos;s up face immediately after the race, while his slouching frame did not need any body language expert for interpretation. He is now 58 points behind Vettel after losing the 10 points he had gained on the world champion in Hungary a month ago. After a little consideration of his efforts on the fast and stunning Spa-Francorchamps circuit, he gathered himself to point out that Mercedes would be more competitive in Singapore next month. But before that comes Monza and another opportunity for Red Bull to extend their already considerable advantage on the quickest track of them all. Vettel is beginning to dominate as he did in 2011 (his 2010 and 2012 wins were much closer affairs). This championship could be over before we get to the US and Brazil at the end of the season. &quot;For sure, that&apos;s a positive message but I&apos;m more happy to win the race,&quot; Vettel said. &quot;It&apos;s a fantastic track. When the car works well you don&apos;t want the race to stop. I didn&apos;t think about the championship or points. I know the higher up you finish, the better it is \u2026 &quot; And then he remembered the mantra: &quot;There is still a long way to go.&quot;     Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, right, embraces Ferrari's Fernando Alonso after the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa. Photograph: Imago / Barcroft Media    Hamilton was in one of his shrugging moods. &quot;It&apos;s difficult when people pull away from you and there is nothing that you can do about it,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel happy that we have extended our lead over Ferrari in the constructors&apos; championship. We are trying to understand where have missed out. The Ferraris were ridiculously fast in the straights. &quot;It is a big, big gap to Seb, so it is going to be very tough to close but I am going to keep pushing. It is going to be very, very tough to beat Sebastian [if he finishes every race]. &quot;He has had a phenomenal car for a long time and he does the job but we have had some strong races in the past and have beaten them, so it doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t do that in the next races. But it&apos;s getting closer to the point where we need to finish ahead of him every single time to close that gap.&quot; Hamilton made a fine start from pole but was easily overtaken by Vettel, going round the outside on the fifth corner of the opening lap. By the second lap Vettel&apos;s lead was up to one and a half seconds and by the halfway stage it was a staggering eight seconds; it was eventually 16.8sec. There was another strong race from Fernando Alonso. He made a great start, moving up from ninth \u2013 his joint worst start of the season \u2013 to fifth by the end of the first lap. By the sixth lap the Spaniard had passed Nico Rosberg to take third as he proved, once again, that his race form is a lot better than his qualifying. The high number of British race fans can only have come away disappointed. Apart from Hamilton&apos;s failure to cut into Vettel&apos;s advantage, his former team-mate Jenson Button could not improve on his starting position of sixth. Spa-Francorchamps, he had said, represented McLaren&apos;s best chance of a podium finish this season. Paul di Resta, starting from fifth, retired after a clash with the Williams of Pastor Maldonado and Max Chilton was last. Meanwhile, the retiring Red Bull driver Mark Webber gave a strong clue that his compatriot Daniel Ricciardo from Toro Rosso would replace him in the team for next season. &quot;The decision&apos;s made,&quot; Webber told Australia&apos;s Channel 10 television at the Belgian Grand Prix. &quot;We all know who it is.

In the developing world, such expertise is in short supply. In an attempt to bridge this knowledge gap, the US food giant is connecting its in-house specialists with small food processing firms in West Africa. Instead of flying its staff out on a Peace Corps-style expedition, its volunteers hook up with local entrepreneurs via Skype, phone and email for an hour or so per week. The model ensures a longer-term engagement and fuller support services, from quality enhancement to marketing. &quot;We now live in a world where a PhD nutritionist sitting in Minneapolis can share that knowledge in almost in real time with a company at the end of the road somewhere in Zambia or Kenya&quot;, said Jeff Dykstra, executive director at Partners in Food Solutions, a business-backed non-profit that was set up to expand General Mills&apos; programme. The social benefits of promoting entrepreneurship in developing markets are indisputable. Partners in Food Solutions has so far supported 50 local food processors in five African countries. The success of these businesses has given rise to a secure market for around 100,000 small producers. Couple that with the increased food security that comes from getting higher quality products onto local shop shelves, and it looks like good news. The business benefits for the project&apos;s corporate sponsors (which now include commodity trader Cargill, among others) are less obvious. None of the corporate participants operate directly in the markets concerned. Nor do any currently have equity stakes or supply relationships with the enterprises that they are assisting. According to Dykstra, the initiative was always designed as a &quot;tweak&quot; on traditional corporate philanthropy. The business outputs that have emerged, which include reputational enhancement and improved employee retention, are incidental &quot;bi-products&quot;, he said. Supporting start-ups: aid or trade? Management theorists increasingly argue that corporate sustainability programmes need to have a business rationale for the sponsor if they are to become, well, sustainable. So can supporting entrepreneurs in the developing world generate mutual benefits? Chris Brett, head of corporate responsibility and sustainability at agricultural and food commodity firm Olam, says yes. It all comes down to supply chain resilience. Olam has around 3.5 million smallholder farmers in its supply chain, he noted: &quot;Enabling farmers to move out of subsistence farming to becoming serious commercial partners is fundamental to our business model.&quot; He cites Olam&apos;s work with rice farmers in Nigeria. The Singapore-listed commodity trader is providing &quot;entrepreneurial smallholder rice farmers&quot; with training, credit and technical inputs to increase their yields and grow operations. The farmers (who commit to selling to Olam) gain from have a stable buyer at a reasonable price, while Nigeria can gradually reduce expensive rice imports (which currently stand at around 1.5m metric tonnes per year). For Olam&apos;s part, it lands itself a long-term supply of good quality crops. The model carries with it two question marks. Firstly, if the entrepreneur is bound entirely within the corporate sponsor&apos;s value chain, the danger of a local monopoly arises. &quot;This structure provides Olam with a great deal of control over prices of inputs, outputs, and, ultimately, over farmers&apos; profits&quot;, a recent report by the Rockefeller Foundation concludes. Secondly and more seriously, it&apos;s debatable whether helping subsistence farmers become better at what they already do strictly counts as promoting entrepreneurialism. Who exactly qualifies as an entrepreneur is highly contested. At its most basic, the term supposes an individual who exploits a new market opportunity to create social or economic value. The emphasis is on the word new. A rice grower is still growing rice, albeit more efficiently. A clearer example perhaps is that of Iri-iani, a co-operative of fairtrade tea producers in Kenya. With funding from UK retailer M&amp;S and several donor agencies, Iri-iani has established its own processing and packaging facilities, enabling it sell branded products rather than raw tea leafs that command a far lower price. M&amp;S still sources Iri-iani&apos;s Pure Origin Mount Kenya Teabags, benefitting from having a higher quality producer in its supply chain, but the cooperative is generating revenues through sales in its domestic market too. &quot;We wanted to help our Kenyan tea farmers understand how to add value to the tea they were growing\u2026 and grow their business beyond just supplying to us&quot;, explained Louise Nicholls, head of responsible sourcing at M&amp;S. Market making Aside from supply security, market creation can represent another powerful motivator for investing in entrepreneurs. Gib Bulloch, executive director at Accenture Development Partnerships said, think of a telecoms company like Vodafone in Africa. Five years ago, its business model was focused almost exclusively on selling airtime and internet bandwidth. Now, it&apos;s moving into mobile-enabled services in sectors such as health, agriculture and banking. Supporting entrepreneurs in these new value chains therefore makes sense for telecom firms, argued Bulloch. The same could feasibly happen in Africa&apos;s agriculture sector, said Simon Winter, senior vice president for TechnoServe, a non-profit working in collaboration with Partners for Food Solutions. He points to Cargill by way of example. The US commodity giant&apos;s primary business model revolves around the production and primary processing of agricultural crops. &quot;They are going to want to make sure there are viable local and regional processors that are then creating demand for those products&quot;, he explained. For large corporations, the logical next step from market creation is market entry. The best small companies eventually become big companies. If and when that happens, who better to step in and acquire these upcoming entrepreneurial firms than the corporations that helped them grow in the first place? Of course, they may prefer to go it alone. The prospect of today&apos;s developing world entrepreneurs becoming tomorrow&apos;s competitors lies a long way off, but it&apos;s not inconceivable, Dykstra admits. &quot;Just like General Mills doesn&apos;t help Iowa companies, at some point this won&apos;t make sense in Africa either&quot;, he added. \u2022 This article was corrected on 27 August 2013 to reflect that Olam is a Singapore listed company and not a US company.

It was ideal for a time when a paternalistic approach to disease was deemed as the right way to go. But in a world of Web 2.0, with an ageing demographic and where multiple conditions are becoming the norm, it is no longer appropriate to suggest that &quot;doctor knows best&quot;. In the report, A promise to learn \u2013 a commitment to act, Don Berwick, the legendary patient safety guru, set out four guiding principles. One of these is to engage, empower and hear patients and carers throughout the entire system and at all times. The point made was that engaging and hearing patients will lead us to understand how current experience suggests poor co-ordination between healthcare and community support. It also hints that poor engagement results in individuals not admitting when and with what they need help \u2013 and this cannot be good for patients or the professionals trying to help them. Yet, the solution must lie in the system and not within the walls of an institution. Integration is a term much bandied about in healthcare and could become a weasel word in the healthcare lexicon if the many pilots we have at present are not effectively implemented; if they don&apos;t begin to provide more care at home and in the community, and if they don&apos;t ensure a more seamless experience. It&apos;s against this background that KPMG recently conducted a survey of 1000 patients, asking them about the future of the NHS. It revealed \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 that only 36% were comfortable with the idea of using technology, with 54% also arguing that taxes should rise to pay for healthcare. So the public are ready to have a much more mature and sophisticated dialogue \u2013 but we need to support their informed choice so that the hospital and the A&amp;E department are not seen as the inevitable solution. While news of an additional \u00a3500m to A&amp;E departments may defer some of the pain of demand over the winter, the sticking plaster approach is not going to yield the sustainable change required. The best integrated systems in the world have sustained leadership, an effective clinical leadership and engagement and have usually invested considerable sums in their IT infrastructure. Two examples speak volumes. To begin with, take Virginia Mason in Seattle \u2013 where Gary Kaplan, the medically qualified CEO, has been in post for 15 years and where Toyota and Six Sigma approaches to clinical practice are a way of life. He says that &quot;you don&apos;t have to be a champion, but you can&apos;t be a burier&quot;. There&apos;s also Kaiser Permanente, where almost 50% of the 9 million population can access their healthcare records online. Yet despite these great examples of care being made fit for the 21st century, KPMG&apos;s latest report, called An Uncertain Age: re-imagining long-term care in the 21st century, suggests that few, if any societies, are facing up to the long-term care problem. Commissioned by the Lien Foundation \u2013 a Singapore philanthropic foundation \u2013 it makes the point that an ageing population coupled with changing demographics, where people move away from their home base, means the threat of less family support is becoming a reality. Add to this the growing cost of healthcare and the dwindling available funding and we need to redraw the way we provide care and the way we engage the population in that change. As our report suggests, person-centred care is a must, institutional boundaries must be redrawn or erased and technology must play a part. Perhaps this is Berwick&apos;s most important guiding principle as, without that engagement, empowerment and listening we will not be able to make the seismic shift required to a holistic view of the system. In other words, we will not be able to move beyond the walls of the hospital, where patients and the public expect increased autonomy in return for greater responsibility for their health.

Engineers were putting the finishing touches to the first of 375 P1 supercars, with the first batch scheduled for delivery in days. First seen at last year&apos;s Paris motor show, the vehicle is a plug-in hybrid that can achieve 0-62mph in less than three seconds and comes with a suitably racy price tag of \u00a3866,000. Over in McLaren Applied Technologies (MAT), managing director of the &quot;start-up&quot; Geoff McGrath and his colleagues were working out how it might be possible for surgeons to operate on patients remotely through simulation. Little wonder the firm has been held up by the government as a poster child for UK industry, innovation, hi-tech manufacturing, engineering and generally everything policymakers would like to see in a more balanced economy that is less reliant on debt-fuelled consumer spending. As McLaren prepares to celebrate its 50th birthday on Monday, it is clear it has become much more than a Formula One team, but its reason for existence is still to win races. The team has won 182 grand prix races since Bruce McLaren&apos;s debut at Monaco in 1966. In that time more than 100 other teams have failed. Whitmarsh&apos;s passion for Formula One is clear. He remains team principal \u2013 only the fourth in McLaren&apos;s history \u2013 and prefers to spend his time in the racing wing of the technology centre. &quot;I came into the sport as a non-racing person but Formula One is quite a contagious environment, which again is probably why I still have an office down there. It&apos;s difficult to get it out of your blood.&quot; He is irked by suggestions that Formula One is an indulgence and McLaren was only taken truly seriously when it began to diversify \u2013 despite the motorsport industry being worth \u00a37bn to Britain. &quot;Racing has been a fantastic British success story but for some reason it&apos;s still treated as a fairly frivolous activity and has not been taken seriously. So in a sense, for McLaren now to be taken seriously it had to be doing something other than all the great things we were doing in motor sport,&quot; Whitmarsh said. Ministers now come regularly through the door at Woking. The chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander and the business secretary, Vince Cable, have been recent visitors. The 50th anniversary coincides with the global premiere of Rush, a film depicting the battle for the 1976 title between arch rivals McLaren&apos;s James Hunt and Ferrari&apos;s Niki Lauda. Button will arrive at the premier in an M23, the car driven by Hunt that season. The glory days may feel a distant memory, with McLaren getting off to a disappointing start in the 2013 season, and Whitmarsh is accustomed to the media onslaught that can accompany a poor performance. &quot;You have to accept it, it&apos;s part of it. Once I&apos;ve reassured my mother that things are OK, life goes on,&quot; he said. For Whitmarsh, the highs have included championship wins with Mika H\u00e4kkinen and Lewis Hamilton, counted by the lows when a driver gets injured or worse, killed. &quot;The death of Ayrton Senna. He wasn&apos;t in our car, but I&apos;d worked with him for the previous four years when he was in our car. So when a driver gets hurt it&apos;s a pretty serious moment for you,&quot; he said. Given the tough backdrop of Formula One and so many failed teams, diversification has been the lifeblood of McLaren, and Whitmarsh makes no apology for it despite some criticism. &quot;People jump on us when we&apos;re not succeeding, saying &apos;They&apos;ve taken their eye off the ball, they&apos;re doing this, they&apos;re not doing that, they&apos;re building this new technology centre, they&apos;re building an automotive business.&apos; And to some extent it&apos;s valid but in any business the management has to marshall its resource and attention between the here and now, and investing in the longer-term health and wellbeing of it. &quot;We are rightly, I hope, respected and feared in motor sport, because we&apos;ve got the industrial, commercial, fiscal strength which is a consequence of that diversification and that distraction. There are probably four Formula One teams that have got clear and sustainable business models, the others have got a real challenge in front of them.&quot; Away from the racing circuit and the usual talk of driver moves, much is happening in the automotive business, which is on target to break even and where it is about to complete its 3,000th car in two years. About 80% of the cars made in Woking are exported, and McLaren now has 50 dealerships around the world, with the first four in China to be opened in the coming weeks. MAT is in its third profitable year, operating in sport, health, energy, and automotive industries. It has ambitions to open two new centres \u2013 in Silicon Valley in the US and Singapore \u2013 within two years. But motor sport will remain central to McLaren&apos;s business in future, said Whitmarsh, even with all the opportunities diversification presents. &quot;There will be some form of motor racing, whether it&apos;s solar powered, hydrogen cell or whatever, and I think in 50 years time we want to be the pre-eminent brand and team and culture in whatever is the pinnacle of motor racing as it then will be. &quot;I think man&apos;s fascination with the best driving experience, the best road cars in the world, it&apos;s clear at the moment that the brand has been Ferrari and \u2026 if we are not aspiring to displace that and replace it with our own then we&apos;re not being ambitious enough.&quot; Britain&apos;s valley of speed Formula One is a global sport, but the engineering brains behind the cars are nearly all based in Britain and invest more than \u00a31bn a year in research and development. Out of the 11 teams competing in this year&apos;s F1 Grand Prix World Championship only three \u2013 Ferrari and Toro Rosso in Italy, and Sauber in Switzerland \u2013 are not based in the UK. The rest, including Mercedes, Williams and Red Bull, all operate out of the so-called Motorsport Valley, which stretches from Northampton to Surrey. The town of Brackley, near Silverstone, in Northamptonshire is home to both Mercedes and Force India and has benefited from almost \u00a31bn of F1 investment over the years. The valley is the biggest motorsport cluster in the world, generating global sales of \u00a37bn, of which \u00a34bn is exported, according to the Motorsport Industry Association (MIA). Chris Aylett, the MIA&apos;s chief executive, said Britain began to dominate F1 engineering in the 1950s and 1960s when British aerospace engineers developed lightweight cars on the dozens of former second world war airfields across the south of England. &quot;Slowly but surely, Motorsport Valley was formed,&quot; he said. &quot;Now 73% of the teams are based here and 73% of the engines are built here.&quot; The valley now acts as a beacon for the best and brightest engineering minds in the world, according to Aylett, with more than 40,000 people employed in F1-related roles in the UK, including 25,000 engineers. &quot;You&apos;ll hear every language in the world if you drive around the valley,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s an international community that just happens to be based here.&quot; Tim Urquhart, analyst at IHS Automotive, said the engineers working in motorsport were &quot;highly skilled and on very high pay&quot;, so benefit the nation both in skills transfer and the tax take. Urquhart said Britain &quot;might not have been great at retaining ownership of automotive businesses, but the engineering talent behind their continued success is British&quot;. Motorsport firms typically spend 30% of turnover on research and development, compared with 4% in engineering, 6% in automotive and 15% in pharmaceuticals.

The scientists, from the UK, Singapore, and US, found that certain fruits, including blueberries, grapes (and raisins), apples and pears were particularly protective. In their studies, the overall risk of the people monitored and developing type 2 diabetes was 6.5%. Three helpings of particular fruits weekly cut the chances of those people developing the disease by 7%. Excepting strawberries and cantaloupe melon, the substitution of whole fruit for juice gave greater protection (also creating a 7% lowered risk). The authors of the study, which is published in the British Medical Journal, said eating more fruit would prevent many chronic diseases. The researchers, led by Qi Sun, of Brigham and Women&apos;s hospital, Harvard Medical School, and Harvard School of Public Health, looked at three large studies in the three countries, which recruited health professionals. Nearly 200,000 people took part. Every four years they completed a food frequency questionnaire. Just over 12,000 of the participants got diabetes. Those who ate whole fruits regularly had a reduced risk and those who drank juice instead had a greater risk. The authors said the speed with which certain fruits and juices pass through to the intestine could partly be why some fruits protect while others, as well as fruit juice, do not. Fruit juice has a relatively high glycaemnic load; the load values per serving are 6.2 for raw oranges and 13.4 for orange juice, with 3.1g and 0.5g of fibre respectively. This &quot;may explain the positive associations between fruit juice consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/aug/30/viber-founder-talmon-marco-privacy", "sentences": ["Speaking from Singapore, Marco is busy preparing the next two important milestones."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-30T14:25:12Z", "title": "Viber founder: 'People should be concerned about privacy'", "tags": ["Telecoms", "Technology", "Skype", "Internet", "Business", "Telecommunications industry", "World news", "Viber"], "article": "From strict privacy policies to its origins in Israel, there are a few things that distinguish Viber, the upstart free calls and messaging application, from its more established rival Skype. But the feature its 200 million international followers seem to appreciate most is the stickers. A selection of images that can be texted as an alternative to written messages, the stickers available include love hearts, a red rose, the obligatory LOL, and the controversial middle finger hand gesture. There have been outraged calls for its removal. Viber founder Talmon Marco is listening. &quot;It will not be available by default with the next release of Viber,&quot; he says. Having begun life three years ago in the Israeli iPhone app store, before going international and onto other mobile platforms including Android, Blackberry and Windows, Viber took the fight to Skype&apos;s home turf by launching a desktop version in May. Downloads onto personal computers are already in the millions. Speaking from Singapore, Marco is busy preparing the next two important milestones. The first is a sticker store. While this may not sound momentous, it represents the company&apos;s first foray into money making. The app and all its current services, including calls between Viber users, will remain free. But in order to transform itself into a real business, Viber must search for revenues. &quot;We announced earlier this year that we will start monetising. The first thing we are going to announce is a sticker store, but we will be introducing additional paid services as early as this year.&quot; The second development, which is already being tested in Saudi Arabia, is technology that can stop Viber being blocked. During its rapid expansion, Viber has occasionally met resistance from both mobile networks and some of the more authoritarian states. For some time, many Vodafone customers have been unable to use Viber without disruption, particularly those on pay-as-you-go tariffs, says Marco. Mobile operators have previously voiced concerns about free calls and messaging apps as a threat to their own revenues. And there has been government opposition. Iran, Syria and Lebanon have all lifted previous blocks on Viber, but the service was recently barred by the Saudi Arabian authorities. Marco says the ban was introduced after Saudi officials indicated to Skype, Viber and the popular messaging service Whatsapp that they would be blocked if they did not agree to be monitored. Social networks have allowed unprecedented freedom to communicate in Saudi Arabia, propelling a steep adoption curve. They are also relied on by the nation&apos;s many foreign workers as a cheap way to keep in touch with families abroad. &quot;A few days ago we launched a test of Viber with enhanced connectivity,&quot; says Marco. &quot;This version allows users to connect in places where Viber is blocked. At present we have several thousand users in Saudi Arabia that can access Viber despite the local ban. Once the technology is rolled out, we will likely roll it out to Vodafone UK users as well.&quot; Marco says he is serious about the right to communicate, and the ability to do so in privacy. Viber&apos;s policy is that if it receives a proper subpoena, it will provide records of who made and received calls, and when, but that no content from those conversations will be shared. He says Viber does not &quot;have the capability to listen to conversations&quot;. Messages are stored, for two weeks or until they are opened by the recipient, whichever is shorter. Around 80% are deleted in less than a second. The messages are encrypted, and Marco says he has never handed the encryption key to any government. &quot;We have been asked if we would co-operate. We never provided anybody with anything that will let them listen to conversations or messages on Viber. I do believe people should take notice of the fact that the Saudi government has threatened three companies with shutdown of service \u2013 us, Skype and Whatsapp. Only one company was shut down. Users should ask themselves why the other companies were not shut down.&quot; In fact, Marco has himself been accused by at least one blogger of being an agent of the Israeli state. The rather sketchy claims are based on his military career. He spent four years in the Israel Defence Forces, rising to chief information officer of the central command. But Viber was funded entirely by what Marco refers to as &quot;friends and family&quot;. &quot;We never took a single dollar from the state of Israel, we are not even incorporated in Israel. We maintain a research and development centre in Israel and that&apos;s it.&quot; For now, Viber is growing quickly. With just 120 staff, based in Cyprus and Belarus as well as Marco&apos;s homeland, the app is being downloaded by more than 500,000 people a day and reached 200m downloads in May. Last time Viber released information on usage, in February, it was carrying 3bn minutes of calls and 12bn text messages every month. It has some way to go to catch up with Skype \u2013 which in April announced 2bn calls a day. But on the mobile phone, if the iPhone app store reviews are to be believed, Viber is better liked. Skype&apos;s transition to mobile has been rocky, with users complaining the service crashes. Most give Skype a one-star rating on iPhone, while Viber receives the maximum of five stars from most of its reviewers. Time will tell whether revelations by the Guardian and other media about the extent of Skype&apos;s cooperation with intelligence agencies will harm its business. But Marco believes individuals should care. &quot;Personally, I would be concerned being on a service knowing that everybody can listen to my conversations,&quot; he says. &quot;People should be concerned about their privacy.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/aug/30/uk-education-system-lags-behind-all-rounders", "sentences": ["Nearly one in eight students from Singapore gain high scores in maths, science and reading, and one in 10 from New Zealand.", "But the UK produces fewer than 5% of these all-rounders, while jurisdictions like Shanghai and Singapore have more than double that.&quot; Among its European peers, the UK performed similarly to Germany and France, but all three were outperformed by the Dutch, Belgians and Swiss."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-30T17:30:07Z", "title": "UK education system lagging behind in producing 'all-rounders'", "tags": ["Secondary schools", "Schools", "Education", "Mathematics", "Science", "UK news"], "article": "  The UK&apos;s education system is lagging behind many of its competitors in producing all-rounders \u2013 students who achieve top results in maths, reading and science exams, analysis from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows.

Yet still they come. Perhaps not in such great numbers as when the global economy was soaring to new heights, but they come all the same: the world&apos;s great cities and their leaders, lining up in a beauty pageant to secure the event that has become all things to all people \u2013 a panacea that can distract from a country&apos;s woes or underline their ambition on a global scale. At the International Olympic Committee&apos;s session in Buenos Aires next weekend, protests and turmoil will seem a world away amid the polite protocol and arcane traditions of the body that will bestow the gift of the 2020 Olympics on Madrid, Istanbul or Tokyo. The first is still in the grip of economic meltdown, the second made global headlines as the centre of political revolt in Taksim Square and the third has convinced many of the 104 voting IOC members that it can host the Games, but has much work to do persuading them why. The six candidates to replace Jacques Rogge as the IOC president and arguably the most important person in world sport, in a vote that will also be decided in Buenos Aires, have lined up to argue that the costs of bidding for and staging the Olympic Games must come down. Yet there appears no sign of the bidding circus and the media frenzy that surrounds it being reduced in scale. The swisher hotels of the Argentinian capital will this week hum to the sound of fevered speculation and last-minute lobbying as the three cities hone their final presentations before Saturday&apos;s vote. The IOC instigated stringent rules in the wake of the Salt Lake City scandal, which tend to place greater importance on the inspection reports compiled by a team led by the British IOC executive board member Sir Craig Reedie. Yet those same reports leave plenty of room for interpretation and, in 2005 and 2009, it was a late drive by a bid that did not begin as favourite but was able to time a last-ditch lobbying push to make a compelling emotional as well as logistical case that came through to win. In 2005 in Singapore Lord Coe and Tony Blair helped London to victory with their stirring legacy pledges. Four years later in Copenhagen Rio swayed the IOC members with promises of beach volleyball on Copacabana and the bald fact that the Games had never been held in South America. The shortlist may not be as long as in previous years \u2013 ambitious but flawed bids from Doha and Baku were chopped at an earlier stage and Rome bowed out as Italy&apos;s economic woes deepened \u2013 but the competition is as keen as ever. The success of the 2012 London Games was a huge relief for the IOC, as the lavish tributes paid by the various presidential candidates have made clear. Dr CK Wu, the sometimes controversial president of the Association of International Boxing Associations, said London was &quot;probably the most successful Olympic Games in history&quot;, adding: &quot;The public support for the sport was so impressive. You have left a legacy in so many ways.&quot; Sergey Bubka, the International Association of Athletics Federations vice-president who is also standing, said it was &quot;unforgettable&quot;. The Singaporean IOC vice-president Ng Ser Miang called the 2012 edition a &quot;huge success&quot;. The legacy rhetoric has allowed the government and the organisers, on the back of sometimes fairly flimsy figures, to declare that the Olympics were not only a success on their own terms but delivered long-lasting reputational and economic benefits. In some ways London 2012 rebooted the Olympic movement after the money-no-object spectacle of Beijing, making governments around the world gaze longingly at the feelgood fillip it provided to a country suffering economically and the extent to which it effectively rebranded London and the UK. The arguments about whether the \u00a38.7bn in public money spent on the Games represented value for money, and indeed whether the true number was in fact far higher, will go on and on. But in the eyes of those who made the bid promises, it was an unalloyed success. Paradoxically, the idea of hosting major sporting events is in some ways more attractive to governments in difficult times \u2013 providing they can convince an often sceptical public that the outlay on infrastructure is worthwhile \u2013 because they deal in the rare and precious commodities of hope and optimism. &quot;There are many reasons why people want to organise the Games. But there is one common denominator,&quot; says Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, the son of the former IOC president and an IOC member who is a pivotal figure in the Madrid delegation. &quot;It is the utmost party of youth, it is the best phenomenon in the world nowadays that delivers inspiration for the youth. It means good news, it means healthy competition, the youth of the world coming together.&quot; Samaranch&apos;s Madrid bid started as an outsider but has gathered momentum and support in recent months and is now a contender. &quot;All of that represents much more than money, much more than investment, new stadia or new airports. It is a dream. It is such good news in a world that has so little good news to offer.&quot; Madrid offers what it calls &quot;a new vision&quot; for the Olympic movement. By promising to hold the Games largely in existing venues and with clever use of temporary ones, it insists the Spanish capital can deliver them at a fraction of the cost. &quot;That&apos;s the feeling we have, momentum wise,&quot; Samaranch added. &quot;It feels everything is clicking together. We&apos;ve put together a very solid bid and we are very happy. We are proud and confident. When you are bidding, you need many things. But there are two key things: you have to prove what differential you can offer to the Olympic movement and why it is important to you.&quot;. &quot;On the first, we believe that in the world today we can&apos;t afford the vast expense of previous Olympic Games. I don&apos;t think there is anyone now who thinks the Games are about big investment programmes.&quot; Istanbul, by contrast, is more in the Rio mould: an expansive, ambitious vision that promises to unite east and west on the banks of the Bosphorus. It was making real headway until the wall-to-wall live coverage of the Taksim Square protests stopped it in its tracks. Tokyo, meanwhile, stands somewhere between the two. The bookmakers&apos; favourite, it ticks all the boxes in terms of infrastructure and facilities but must convince IOC members it can pack an emotional punch and improve its reputation for dour presentations \u2013 explain the &quot;why&quot; as well as the &quot;how&quot;. There does seem to be a genuine push within the IOC hierarchy to find ways of reducing the costs of the summer Games, even as they search for new events and responsibilities elsewhere to expand their remit. It has become a key debating point in a presidential race that began with the German Thomas Bach as favourite but in which he faces a tough challenge from the 64-year old Singaporean Ng, who has the advantage of representing the view that the IOC should look beyond Europe for its leader for the first time. Wu said: &quot;To reduce the costs is very important. With the economy as it is, who can guarantee that in future cities will be able to afford to hold a Games like this. My proposal is to make 50% of the venues temporary. After the Games, they can be dismantled and shipped to the next Olympic Games to be used.&quot; And yet even while the candidates pursue their austerity manifestos to match the times, the three 2020 bidders will leave no stone unturned and no expense spared in their efforts to secure the self-styled greatest sporting show on earth."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/01/lagos-businesses-superpastor-joshua", "sentences": ["&quot;He can cook food from Singapore, because we were having a lot of guests from there who struggle with Nigerian food,&quot; says the manager, Ruky, at a reception desk framed by pictures of Joshua."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-01T14:32:45Z", "title": "Lagos businesses cash in on lure of super-pastor TB Joshua", "tags": ["Nigeria", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "  In Africa&apos;s largest metropolis, the district of Ikotun Egbe has turned into a boom town. The draw? Temitope Balogun Joshua, one of Nigeria&apos;s richest &quot;super-pastors&quot;, whose church attracts 50,000 worshippers weekly \u2013 more than the combined number of visitors to Buckingham Palace and the Tower of London. Seeking promises of prosperity and life-changing spiritual experiences, visitors flock from around the globe. Enterprising Lagos residents \u2013 those not turfed out by landlords turning their properties into hotels \u2013 have transformed the rundown area into a hotbed of business. On a Saturday afternoon, traffic swirls around the four-storey, giant-columned Synagogue Church of All Nations. Delegates are pouring in for the following day&apos;s service. &quot;They should really build a branch in South Africa \u2013 it&apos;s a long way to come and the hotels here are so-so,&quot; says Mark, a sunburnt businessman from Johannesburg, accompanied by two friends from Botswana. As the church&apos;s palm tree-lined entrance gives way to a maze of skinny, unpaved roads, knots of touts materialise. &quot;In one year I made enough money to buy my first car,&quot; says Chris, using a tattered hotel brochure to mop his brow. He is paid 100 naira (about 40p) for each client he brings in. Sparkling new hotels rise incongruously among the shacks. At one, with a logo suspiciously similar to the Sheraton&apos;s, a new chef has recently been employed. &quot;He can cook food from Singapore, because we were having a lot of guests from there who struggle with Nigerian food,&quot; says the manager, Ruky, at a reception desk framed by pictures of Joshua. Tony Makinwa says most of his laundromat profits come from tourists. &quot;God has favoured my business. People come here and fall in love with the place and overstay their visits,&quot; he says. Also doing a roaring trade are the international calling centres with foreign visitor discounts, clothes shops offering outfits to celebrate miracles, and the plastic chair rentals that cater for church overspill. The area&apos;s dirt streets are punctured by unfinished, barnlike buildings as dozens of other churches offer all-day worship services. Almost as many mosques dot the area. Islam and Christianity are growing at blistering paces across Africa, with Nigeria home to the continent&apos;s most populous mix of both faiths. Money-changer Sidi Bah has travelled thousands of miles from Mali to continue his trade here. &quot;I came because I heard many people from many countries visit. In one day I can change six or seven different types of currency,&quot; he says. &quot;There are more mosques here than in my village in [Muslim] Mali.&quot; Miracle-promising Pentecostal churches took root across the continent in the 1980s, as African economies were battered by falling world commodity prices. Migrants poured into slums in search of jobs and dreams. Ruky has converted her cramped home into a 20-bed lodging where mainly rural workers stay for 800 naira a night. Mattresses are half price. &quot;If you are sick like me, you have no job, so you are used to sleeping on the floor anyhow,&quot; says Andrew Olagbele, whose spine was crushed by a car accident, lying on a mattress in a crammed room. &quot;I pray the Lord will touch me tomorrow so I can walk again.&quot; As dusk sets in, cars continue streaming in. A man hanging from the open door of a car thundering gospel songs waves copies of homemade CDs for sale. Denis Kokou and his wife, a baby on her hip, look on with weary smiles. &quot;This is our first time coming from [regional neighbour] Togo.

By including private borrowing from overseas by firms and consumers, as well as government debts, the Jubilee Debt Campaign says its data reveals the true scale of the burden on struggling countries around the world. The Seychelles, which received an IMF bailout at the height of the world financial crisis in late 2008, tops the list with net debts worth more than a year and a half&apos;s GDP. It is followed by four victims of the eurozone crisis: Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain. The UK is the 98th most indebted country, according to the study. But when gross private debts are taken into account \u2013 without offsetting foreign liabilities \u2013 the UK shoots up the list. Foreign debts owed by Britain&apos;s private sector, mainly by banks, amount to 364% of GDP, Jubilee says, making Britain the fourth most indebted country on those terms. Ireland tops this private sector league with debts worth 900% of GDP. Jubilee helped to fight for large-scale cancellation of developing countries&apos; debts from 2000 onwards, and some beneficiaries such as Liberia and Burundi still have among the lowest government debt payments as a proportion of GDP in the world. But Tim Jones, who compiled the data, said the scale of the criss-crossing IOUs between many of the world&apos;s major countries showed how vulnerable the international economy remained. &quot;These figures show the huge imbalances which continue to plague the global economy. Large debts in some countries are matched by huge lending from the likes of German, British and Swiss banks. This creates a global boom-bust cycle which has been repeated for the last 30 years, from Africa and Latin America, to east Asia and Europe, and now India once again,&quot; he said. The Indian government has had to step in to try to halt a breakneck slide in the rupee in recent weeks, as foreign investors pull out their capital due to fears that the US Federal Reserve is about to halt its $85bn-a-month quantitative easing programme. As well as totting up debts, Jubilee has also revealed the countries most responsible for pouring capital into other economies in the form of loans, often the proceeds of a large trade surplus. Singapore, Switzerland and Saudi Arabia emerge as the largest net creditors to the rest of the world. Singapore has net loans to the rest of the world worth almost three years&apos; GDP. Karel Williams, of the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change at Manchester University, said these creditor countries should be held equally culpable for periodic global debt crises, along with the debtors who often take much of the blame. &quot;It&apos;s like blaming prostitution on the poor girl who&apos;s prostituting herself: there&apos;s a punter involved here,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s a problem about trade imbalances which drives countries to recycle them.&quot; Unless the proceeds are reinvested abroad \u2013 as Norway does with much of its oil fund, for example \u2013 a large trade surplus can drive up a country&apos;s currency. In a separate analysis, Jubilee Debt Campaign also lists the countries where repaying government debts swallows up the largest proportion of revenues. Lebanon tops this list, with more than 55% of the money that comes into the treasury going straight back out to creditors. Jamaica, Greece and Ireland all spend more than 25% of revenues on servicing their national debt. Jan Toporowski, professor of economics and finance at University of London&apos;s school of Oriental and African studies, said: &quot;This is the untold story behind developments in international banking and finance, a story which shows that these are not just everyday transactions helpfully carried out by international banks as a benefit to the world in general. The data shows the legacy of debt that is the consequence of international transactions carried out without a proper system of debt management. They highlight the most urgent issue in international finance.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/most-blatant-election-themed-ads", "sentences": ["Featuring a line-drawn Little Kev and standard fare &quot;prices slashed&quot; cheesiness, the ad is still cleverly simple and endearingly lo-fi (the solitary ropey YouTube clip I could find may indicate that only one other person shares my view):             Air carrier Scoot, the low-price offshoot of Singapore Airlines, goes down a more groan-inducing route, extending the wordplay to Rudd&apos;s opponent and coming up with: &quot;It&apos;s Abbott time you got a Ruddy good fare.&quot; You geddit, right?"], "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T00:33:00Z", "title": "Election-themed ads: the most blatant political tie-ins", "tags": ["Australian politics", "Australia news", "World news", "Advertising"], "article": "If you just can&apos;t get enough of election advertising \u2013 and let&apos;s face it, who can? \u2013 it seems Adland is doing its best to fill any gaps that may be left in your attention span during these dying days of the campaign.

The news indicates that the smartphone business has created a new category lying between the standard smartphone and the tablet, first mapped out by Dell with its Streak phone in June 2010, but subsequently capitalised on by Samsung with its Galaxy Note and successors. A total of 25.2m &quot;phablets&quot; shipped in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), compared to 12.6m tablets (over 7in) and 12.7m portable PCs, IDC said. Phablet shipments have grown dramatically - doubling between the first and second quarter, and rising sixfold compared to the same time last year. However Samsung&apos;s principal rival in the smartphone space, Apple, is unlikely to be able to capitalise on the popularity of phablets this year. Its new iPhones, expected to be unveiled this month, will be using the same 4in screen seen in last year&apos;s iPhone 5, according to leaks from the supply chain over the past few months. That suggests that it would not be able to introduce a &quot;phablet&quot;-style device before 2014 - even if it wants to. Analysts had foreseen the potential for 2013 to be &quot;the year of the phablet&quot; in January, after noting the rapid rise of the large-screened phones in 2012. That month saw China&apos;s Huawei and ZTE both launch their own versions at the Consumer Electronics Show. Taiwan&apos;s HTC has also followed with its own &quot;Butterfly&quot; model. Samsung more recently staked out the top end of the phablet space with its 6.3in Galaxy Mega, unveiled in April. &quot;Users have realised that a nearly 5-inch screen isn&apos;t such a cumbersome device,&quot; said Joshua Flood of ABI Research in January, and forecast then that countries such as Japan and South Korea, and then India, China and Malaysia, would be major markets for the larger devices. Neil Mawston of Strategy Analytics was more straightforward: &quot;We expect 2013 to be the year of the phablet,&quot; he said in January. Flood&apos;s forecast has been borne out, with phablets accounting for 30% of all smartphone sales in India. The key beneficiary is Samsung, whose Galaxy Note range - due to be enhanced this week with the Note 3 on Wednesday - had nearly 50% of the market. But it has had to fight off rivals which have jumped onto the bandwagon. At its launch at the end of 2011, the Note had 90% of the much smaller phablet space.  Their popularity points to a regional preference for larger screens which can be used to carry out work on the go, rather than separate functions to a smaller smartphone and larger tablet. The Asia/Pacific region, and especially China, are seen as a key battleground for the smartphone business as western markets such as North America and Europe move past the early burst of adoption, and sales growth there slows down. By contrast countries such as China, India and others are seeing rapid uptake. &quot;Phablets first started as a trend driven by mature markets like South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore \u2013 and these markets continue to rise,&quot; said Melissa Chau, senior research manager for IDC&apos;s Asia/Pacific client device team. &quot;What&apos;s changed now is the added pick up of phablets in emerging markets like China and India, not just the plethora of big-name vendors competing head-to-head with Samsung, but instead the low-cost local players who have swooped in to offer big screens for less money \u2013 averaging a retail price of US$220 versus Samsung&apos;s US$557.&quot;  Dell lost out by being too early to the market with the Streak, introducing it at a time when most users had smaller phones with screens under 4in diagonally. But the rise in smartphone penetration, and the shift to more data-centric uses such as maps, has made big screens popular - particularly in countries where the device needs to serve multiple computing needs. ."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/02/campaign-diary-stairway-to-kevin", "sentences": ["In the 2010 election, approximately 15,000 Australians voted in London, with more than 7,500 in Hong Kong and 3,200 in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T09:03:48Z", "title": "Campaign diary: stairway to Kevin", "tags": ["Australian election 2013", "Australian politics", "Labor party", "Liberal party", "Nick Xenophon", "Sarah Hanson-Young"], "article": "Quotes of the day Tony Abbott on Sunday:  We&apos;ve got a civil war going on in that benighted country between two pretty unsavoury sides.

Kwan delves into the world of the Singaporean &quot;overseas&quot; Chinese \u2013 an elite breed sporting Huntsman blazers and matching Queen&apos;s English accents, who shoot off to island getaways in their private jets.

The reader almost needs an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of who thinks what of whom, and why. Crazy Rich even offers a playful riff on the trope of all Asians being good at math, when Chuppies at a bachelorette spa weekend run the numbers before convincing one of their own to dump her &quot;poor&quot; boyfriend. After projected income taxes, mortgage and property taxes, school fees, Swedish au pairs, Sri Lankan maids, dresses, shoes, facials, manis, pedis and Pilates, the girls have (in their heads, anyway) &quot;already spent $470,000 of Simon&apos;s salary&quot;. It&apos;s the sort of lighting-quick computations I haven&apos;t seen since the SATs. The book has been the blockbuster beach read of the summer, so clearly these stereotypes are resonating with the masses. Hunger Games producer Nina Jacobson has optioned the film rights. Vogue, Vanity Fair, Wall Street Journal \u2013 media outlets as prestigious as the designer name-brands flaunted throughout the novel \u2013 have all touted their praise.  The great irony \u2013 and pleasure \u2013 of Crazy Rich Asians is that those being stereotyped stereotype right back. Call it a reversal of the collective gaze. Yet for all the stereotypes it exposes then skewers, there are others peddled so earnestly that the reader can&apos;t help but wonder at Kwan&apos;s agenda. Take, for example, Rachel, the least glamorous character in the book. A 29-year-old tenure-track professor of economics at NYU, she eschews the &quot;crazy rich&quot; world, yet still boasts an elite academic pedigree. A pedigree Kwan goes out of his way to tell us, in a manner devoid of all wry commentary: &quot;She went to school at two of the nation&apos;s top universities \u2013 Stanford and Northwestern.&quot; This coming from an author who name-drops Elie Saab, Patek Philippe and Anderson &amp; Sheppard without a whit of explanation. Add to that her (naturally) pretty face, kind heart and &quot;sexiest legs on the planet&quot;, and Rachel makes the perfect stereotype of the bride-to-be. The main character Nick, an Oxbridge-educated New York University history professor with boy band good looks, a massive fortune and do-the-right-thing attitude, is so vanilla he barely comes alive off the page. The novel also places a disturbing emphasis on eugenics. The noble-hearted are descended from the noble-hearted. The old-money characters are tall, chiseled and handsome; yet their counterparts are not \u2013 like Wye Mun Goh, a day laboring mainlander turned millionaire, whose entire bloodline has unluckily inherited his dark, squat, &quot;pixieish&quot; features. Crazy Rich Asians is as steeped in the stereotypes it seems to rail against.  But ultimately, novels like Kwan&apos;s can be taken as (small) signs of progress \u2013 they expand our portfolio of how Asians are perceived in the media. There&apos;s also something refreshing about this appropriation of self-representation. It almost makes me envy this new generation of Asians, who at least get an upgrade on the stereotypes they&apos;ll now face. And there&apos;s one more thing Crazy Rich Asians achieves that has yet to be addressed. A male author \u2013 an Asian one at that \u2013 has pushed past the velvet ropes of race, culture and gender, to tap that exclusive genre: chick lit. A move arguably more ambitious than breaking into Singapore&apos;s moneyed elite."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/03/filipino-art-manila-vice-ocampo", "sentences": ["They have held exhibitions in Manila as well as in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei and San Francisco."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-03T13:00:54Z", "title": "Art from the Philippines showcases global influences anchored in Manila", "tags": ["Art and design", "Art", "Culture", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "France", "World news", "Europe"], "article": "In the catalogue to his show, Romeo Lee, born in 1956, describes himself as &quot;the first Filipino punk&quot;. The blurb states that &quot;he persists in defining himself as &apos;underground&apos;&quot;, even though he is well known in his country and the Pacific region in general. He has yet to make a name in France, but the Manila Vice exhibition currently in S\u00e8te in southern France, will certainly help. Here Lee occupies an entire wall of the vast international museum of lowbrow art (Mus\u00e9e International des Arts Modestes, or MIAM) established in 2000 by Herv\u00e9 Di Rosa and Pascal Saumade. The wall is black and Lee has covered it with white drooling dragons, giant snails, laughing vampires and owls on dead trees. The drawings are highly skilled yet simplistic, doubtless a reference to some of the sources of this nightmare bestiary: cartoons, horror film posters, graffiti and tattoos. Above this vast mural, Lee has hung a dozen or so paintings that date between 2005 and 2012.They are so high up that you have to twist your neck to see them or climb a metal staircase in this strange museum to get a better view. There it becomes clear that Lee does not have one specific painting style but varies effects and techniques, alternating between powerful representational and expressionistic extremes. Most of these paintings are remarkable, and one or two are quite outstanding. Some would not be out of place next to a Basquiat; others would stand up easily in the company of a Kirchner or a Dix. The first Filipino punk is the most visible revelation in the Manila Vice exhibition, but not the only one. This is the first time we have had an opportunity to explore Filipino art in France, and of the 23 Filipino artists whose works are on display, Lee is the oldest while the youngest were born in the 80s. They have studied in the Philippines but some also in the US: for instance, Armando Flores and Gerardo Tan. They have held exhibitions in Manila as well as in Hong Kong, Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei and San Francisco. In other words, these artists are familiar with the international contemporary art scene, but rather than work in New York or Berlin, most of these artists prefer to stay in and around their hometown of Manila. The life of that megalopolis \u2013 its cultures and iconographic traditions, the blend of religions, and the social and economic situation, where ostentatious wealth is juxtaposed with extreme poverty \u2013 is omnipresent in these works. The way the works are hung triggers many allusions to pre- and post-colonial Philippines, with display cases of figurines of Christ and Christian saints, toys inspired by Hollywood movies and their spinoffs, and primitive statuettes of rice deities. In addition to utilitarian objects made using the same aesthetic principles, here are also lifesize statues, realistic down to the details of the clothing. They resemble those by Maurizio Cattelan but are created by artisans from the Baguio region, who carve them with chainsaws before sculpting the details, painting them in a range of bright colours and varnishing them. There is no transition between the various works. Scenes with a Christian inspiration are placed side-by-side with paintings of monsters and zombies, and the Lamentation of Christ may be reinterpreted in the style of a rather less Catholic Night of the Living Dead. That is how things are in the Philippines, a country of hybrid culture, which has assimilated its indigenous roots, the Spanish, and later the American colonists, in addition to the influence of its relations with Asia. The unity of the exhibition lies in the artists&apos; total lack of hierarchy or prohibitions concerning their country&apos;s stock of references. Dina Gadia and Katwo Puertollano have made use of low-grade and Disney films, while Maria Jeona Zoleta consumes vast quantities of TV series and tabloids. Jayson Oliveria&apos;s smoking-and-pissing King Kong is fairly explicit, and Pow Martinez does not go in for nuance in his bloody neo-primitive genre.     Manuel Ocampo \u2026 'His paintings fill the entire vast exhibition space, each one swarming with monsters and demons'    The works echo each other from one wall to the next, clashing and finally mutually explaining each other since they all lead to the same pictorial chaos of names and myths. Most of the invited artists are painters and flow effortlessly, and perhaps mockingly, between references to the history of art and art markets. Jayson Oliveria happily shifts from his pissing King Kong to a richly coloured Richer-type abstract, demonstrating that he is quite as much at ease with one style as the other. The predominance of paintings may be due to the show&apos;s curator, Manuel Ocampo, who is a painter himself, born in the Philippines in 1965. He trained in Los Angeles and now lives in Seville. Ocampo&apos;s reputation has been established for more than a decade, spanning the Venice Biennale, the Lyon Contemporary Art Biennale and Documenta IX in Kassel, Germany. A number of scandals certainly contributed to his fame, but he has kept in the background for the Manila Vice exhibition, with only a mural drawing at the entrance (but a fairly shocking one), and a small painting of a narcissistic fish. However, in an exhibition of his works in Montpellier&apos;s Carr\u00e9 Sainte-Anne, a former church, Ocampo is far less restrained. Baroque might best describe it. His paintings fill the entire vast exhibition space, each one swarming with monsters and demons, religious or cabalistic signs, symbols and historic quotations. His still-lifes abound with axes, empty bottles and branches. He often writes on his canvases (in French or English) and assembles such a large variety of pictorial pastiches that it is impossible to keep track of them. One might tire of this verbosity and overabundance if Ocampo&apos;s principal aim were to demonstrate that he is a virtuoso of such hybrid forms. But there is far more to his works than that. They convey a deep, genuine anguish and a rage against religion and globalisation. The two exhibitions, in S\u00e8te and in Montpellier, are inseparable because Ocampo has played a key role in the formation and recognition of Filipino art through his own work and, as in these exhibitions, by his actions.

But after school I ran only on a hockey pitch. Then in 2010, at the age of 41, I decided to do two things: first, to go to sea on a container ship for five weeks; second, to learn to run properly. This plan was somewhat flawed. Picture this container ship for a minute: it is a working vessel, the length of three football fields and 10 storeys high. Its decks are covered with stacks of coloured metal containers \u2013 &quot;boxes&quot; in industry language. There is no pretty promenade deck, no shuffleboard. There is only metal and water, neither of which are conducive to running. But I was lucky enough to go to sea on a good ship. Maersk Kendal, operated by the Danish company Maersk (revenues the size of Microsoft, with none of the fame) took its seafarers&apos; welfare seriously enough to provide them with a basketball court on the poop deck (an odd choice, when balls must surely have bounced merrily over the rail into the ocean), a swimming pool (though I never saw it filled), and a gym on B-deck, with several machines, weights, a TV, and in the corner, my salvation. A treadmill. The gym was in the accommodation house, a block where the Kendal&apos;s crew \u2013 who number 19, though they had 7,000 boxes to look after \u2013 live, rest and work. I learned my bearings in a couple of days: my quarters were on D deck, the bridge was two decks up, food was two below and the gym was one deck further down. I&apos;d loaded Get Running, a couch-to-5K app onto my iPhone before I left \u2013 there was no chance of downloading it at sea \u2013 and off I went. There was no risk that I would skip a session: I had a lot of downtime, and a lot to run off, such as a stepfather sectioned with violent Alzheimer&apos;s, a recent diagnosis of severe endometriosis and a book to write that was going nowhere. Ship-running also taught me a rare stability, as the monsoon waves of the Indian Ocean sent the gym swaying by about 20 degrees each way. I could always get my sessions in, because the gym wasn&apos;t popular. The captain liked to use the rowing machine, but only in the evening when other crew members were not likely to be there. The first officer did some desultory exercises and gladly accepted my yoga DVD because his brother swore yoga had cured his migraines. But there were only three regulars: Julius Jefferson, a muscled able seaman, and the quieter of the two cadets on board, who was training to run a marathon with his dad. I knew when he had been in because the clock was covered with a towel. He wanted to run with his dad, but really he just wanted to be with his dad. As the five weeks passed his quietness magnified, along with his homesickness. The crew often joked that their job was like being in prison with a salary, although researchers have found that UK prisons provide better facilities than many working ships. So why weren&apos;t they in the gym? Because they were too knackered. Modern container ships require a punishing amount of work. A ship needs constant care. Even one carrying as many boxes as Kendal can be in and out of port in only 24 hours. Seafarers barely have time to get ashore for a paper, let alone a long run. When a fitness trainer embarked at Rotterdam for four days, there was a flurry of gym attendance, but once the trainer departed, so did the enthusiasm. So Julius, the quiet cadet and I carried on, and I completed week five of couch to 5K. I disembarked at Singapore, having gone through pirate waters, monsoon weather and 9,288 nautical miles of ocean. Did I go running immediately around a Singaporean park? No, because I was too sad at leaving the ship, and because I&apos;d got mentally stuck on the treadmill. It took me another year to discover outdoor running, collect a daft number of running shoes and learn to love mud. I picture the cadet, though, still somewhere running on a swaying ship, a towel-covered clock on the wall, dreaming of home, and of grass. \u2022 Deep Sea and Foreign Going: Inside Shipping, the Invisible Industry that brings You 90% of Everything, by Portobello Books, is published on 12 September."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/sep/04/showcase-home-business-innovation-gd-inspires", "sentences": ["Within a month I had clients from three cities in three countries \u2013 Singapore, San Francisco and London, all through referrals."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-04T16:05:34Z", "title": "Home Business Innovation: GD Inspires", "tags": ["Small Business Showcase"], "article": "Name: GD InspiresCity: LondonWebsite: www.gdinspires.com  GD Inspires is a brand strategy consultancy operating globally from my home office in west London.

The industrial designer made the comments as the company he founded under his own name announced a 19% increase in annual profits to \u00a3364m and announced plans to recruit 650 new engineers, 250 of whom would be found in Britain. Determined to push for even more innovation, Dyson said he was increasing the company&apos;s spending on research and development (R&amp;D) by 25% this year. The company already spends \u00a31.5m a week. &quot;We hear a lot about Silicon Roundabout, but companies such as Facebook employ 4,000 people whereas Caterpillar [the tractor and digger manufacturer] has 150,000. Companies like mine, or Jaguar Land Rover, are booming. I am recruiting 650 highly trained engineers and scientists now but I could take on 2,000 if I could find them,&quot; he said. Dyson said that 50% of his company&apos;s \u00a31.2bn sales in 2012 came from recently invented technologies, such as those employed in digital motors and cordless vacuum cleaners. The growth and success of the business was constrained only by a lack of skilled staff, he said. &quot;The government has done everything we asked for in our Ingenious Britain [policy blueprint] in the way of R&amp;D tax incentives and the rest. But we can&apos;t get enough engineers \u2013 88% of postgraduate students in Britain are from outside the EU and they are taking their technology skills back home with them. We need [ministers] to talk up the opportunities in engineering at every opportunity.&quot; Dyson will be paying its new postgraduate British recruits \u00a333,000 a year plus a \u00a33,000 &quot;golden handshake&quot; to work at the firm&apos;s head office and R&amp;D base in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. The firm switched its manufacturing to Singapore and Malaysia in 2002 but said the advantage was not the cost of wages or equipment but the huge local supply chains that made it easy to source parts. Dyson has just spent \u00a3150m on a new high-tech motor plant in Singapore. The entrepreneur insisted he had moved assembly functions overseas because he had been refused planning permission to increase the size of the Malmesbury plant, although trade unionists said he was looking at the time for cheaper labour. Dyson said the company remained British and although the washing machines, vacuum cleaners and hand dryers were assembled in Asia, the exports were all billed through the UK. In 2012 the company paid \u00a365m in domestic corporation tax although it now sells all over the world, with Japan one of its fastest growing markets. The firm&apos;s upright vacuum cleaner was becoming a brand leader in the US, Dyson said. He added that there was nothing stopping British engineering firms being world leaders but the key was to spend heavily and carefully both on new designs and products. When Dyson was manufacturing in Wiltshire, the company was making 800,000 machines a year but that number has now reached up to 9m. Dyson said he was also worried that new thinking was absent from the energy debate in Britain. He said he remained highly sceptical about the value of windfarms and believed the government should invest in new forms of nuclear power."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2013/sep/05/protecting-green-belt-promise-kept", "sentences": ["To protect the green belt completely you would need to develop enormous skyscraper residential buildings, as seen in places such as Vancouver and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-05T07:00:00Z", "title": "Protecting the green belt is a promise that cannot be kept", "tags": ["Housing Network", "Development", "Community building", "London", "Society Professionals"], "article": "The coalition agreement is toothless on the green belt. It says &quot;we will maintain the green belt \u2026 and other environmental protections.&quot; But as no one is suggesting the abolition of the green belt, this is a promise easily kept. It is much weaker than Eric Pickles&apos;s 2011 promise that the green belt was &quot;solid and absolutely inviolate&quot;. Hannah Fearn last week argued this was a promise that should never have been made; instead, it&apos;s a promise that could never have been kept. Housing development on green belt land doubled over the past year \u2013 and could easily double again over the next two. Protecting areas of natural beauty has never been the aim of the green belt, rather it is a policy of urban containment, a policy which was only sustainable so long as there were other places for development to go. A change of plan Part of the government&apos;s introduction of localism was the abolition of regional planning, which saw key planning decisions devolved to local authorities. Regional planning was seen by the coalition to impose policies on local planners and antagonise communities. But without regional planning, we can no longer have new towns and we no longer have urban regeneration. David Cameron praised the post-war regional plan of Patrick Abercrombie that saw London&apos;s green belt established and a string of new towns created, yet oversaw the abolition of regional planning, which meant 300,000 fewer new houses planned. The real issue is whether or not there are realistic alternatives to the loss of the green belt. The only way you could now get the kind of strategy that Abercrombie pioneered is by local authorities&apos; co-operating under the government&apos;s duty to co-operate. Yet there is now little co-operation without the guiding hand of government to force deals. Is there a better way? The alternatives are building more within urban centres or a new generation of garden cities. Developing on brownfield land in urban areas will not be enough. There just isn&apos;t enough land in the right places. To protect the green belt completely you would need to develop enormous skyscraper residential buildings, as seen in places such as Vancouver and Singapore. But building extremely high-density housing is impossible without new rapid transit systems, otherwise there will be huge congestion. This would require an urban investment plan of the kind being developed by many emerging economies. The second alternative is garden cities \u2013 the development of new satellite towns built around existing economic centres. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and planning minister Nick Boles both endorsed a new generation of garden cities last year, but the government seem to have gone quiet on the idea now. Failures in planning policy are increasing the amount of development on the green belt \u2013 and no alternative is possible without greater guidance from government. The green belt will continue to shrink until this is addressed. Andrew Lainton is an independent planning and regeneration consultant Want to have your say on the subject?

And someone will invariably respond, &quot;But you&apos;re smart, what do you really want to do?&quot; As backhanded compliments go, that one really rankles. What I find most irksome isn&apos;t even the implication that my colleagues and I are typically mundane or that my work of the last decade has been a waste of my time. The most frustrating thing about hearing that I&apos;m &quot;too smart&quot; for teaching is the counter-productive mentality about my profession that such a comment underscores. In the early half of the 20th century, a bright woman&apos;s best career option was to be a teacher. Now, thankfully, most every path is open to women, the only downside of which is the inevitable matriculation of top female graduates away from the field of teaching due to a plethora of other choices. This trend is compounded by the fact that teaching is now seen as a B-list job: Most top graduates of my college went into law, medicine, business, or academia. Those who did go into teaching, myself included, constantly encountered the assumption that this would be a short-term gig, the ubiquitous two-year foray (through Teach for America or the like) that would ultimately pad graduate school applications. For many, it was. Teaching wasn&apos;t, and \u2013 10 years later \u2013 still isn&apos;t, seen as a &quot;prestigious&quot; career, even by liberal university graduates who would all agree that strong public education is an inviolable social good.  The irony is that the same people who feel very comfortable with the idea that teaching isn&apos;t a job for smart people, who cavalierly advise top graduates to pursue more lofty aspirations, will then decry teachers for not doing their jobs well enough, or myopically assert that under-qualified, ill-prepared teachers are responsible for the problems in education today.  In the current culture of education reform, the emphasis on &quot;accountability&quot; means teachers are the ones called to the carpet when students lag in math, language arts, and science. Think about the recent US reform programs \u2013 No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, Common Core \u2013 each of these assigns teachers the sometimes Herculean task of raising students to a certain point (as determined by test scores or grade-level standards), while failing to ask certain crucial questions: How are we recruiting and preparing the people who educate our children? How can we attract the best possible cadre of well-educated, intelligent professionals, who are up to a task of this magnitude? And how can we make them feel valued enough to stay? According to a 2010 McKinsey study, the world&apos;s top-performing education systems \u2013 South Korea, Finland, Singapore \u2013 have this in common: 100% of teachers come from the top third of the college graduates, which (along with good working conditions, ample training and professional development, and higher salaries) promotes a culture wherein the teaching profession is viewed as selective and prestigious.  In America, 23% of teachers come from the top third of their academic cohorts, and a mere 14% of those go on to work in high-needs schools, where arguably there is the direst need for talent. In the same study&apos;s survey of top graduates&apos; attitudes towards teaching, only 66% of respondents agreed with the statement, &quot;I would be proud to tell people I had this job&quot;, and only 37% agreed that &quot;people who have this job are considered successful&quot;. Note that I am NOT saying that the myriad problems of American education are due to low-quality teachers, or that smarter teachers would automatically yield higher student test scores. Endemic child poverty, low school budgets, the lack of alternatives to a traditional college-prep track, and a dwindling valuation of education in our culture \u2013 these are all equally important reasons why American schools are falling behind their global counterparts. What I am saying is this: the business of educating children cannot be over-valued in importance, and one part of a multi-pronged solution to the American education crisis must be a large-scale effort to recruit and keep high-quality teachers to the classroom.  How can we do this? We can make entrance to education schools more competitive, require strong content-area credentials for prospective teachers, provide meaningful training and professional development, and raise teacher salaries. But above all, the prevailing mentality about teaching must be overhauled. American education is in crisis, and student outcomes across the nation are in dire need of improvement; it is counter-productive to denigrate the occupation of the very people tasked with bringing about these changes, and to discourage our top graduates from entering a profession where their talents are sorely needed. Discussions of teacher accountability can only proceed meaningfully once the profession itself gets some respect."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/05/fernando-alonso-italian-gp-vettel", "sentences": ["He said: &quot;We need to change this situation and we will be happy finishing in front of [Seb] here in Monza and in Singapore.", "Sept: 7 Italy (Monza), 21 Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-05T21:16:00Z", "title": "Fernando Alonso targets 'must-win' Italian GP to halt Sebastian Vettel", "tags": ["Fernando Alonso", "Formula One 2013", "Ferrari", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Fernando Alonso has targeted the Italian Grand Prix as a must-win race if Red Bull&apos;s Sebastian Vettel is to be stopped from winning his fourth straight Formula One world championship.

Last year&apos;s inaugural race in Austin was considered to be one of the great successes of the season but a great deal of that success was down to the high number of Mexicans at the Austin circuit. Repeatedly, F1 has made inroads into the vast American market \u2013 Watkins Glen, Indianapolis, Phoenix, for example \u2013 before failing to build on its success, and Austin could be another example. Mexico City has been included in a provisional 21-race calendar for 2014, a schedule which also includes new events in Austria and Russia, although as expected there is no New Jersey on the draft. Teams are known to be against anything more than 20 races, so one of the those listed will probably drop out; Korea, Russia and Mexico all await confirmation. The last Formula One race held in Mexico was in 1992 and it was won by Britain&apos;s Nigel Mansell, his world championship year. A return to Mexico would delight the McLaren driver Sergio P\u00e9rez, who is from Guadalajara and visited his homeland recently. He said: &quot;I hope to see a grand prix here soon. It would be a great opportunity for the country. There&apos;s a lot of enthusiasm for F1 in Mexico.

But at Simon Langton Grammar in Kent, teachers now have every reason to be persuading their pupils to pound down the halls. &quot;The more footsteps the better as far as we&apos;re concerned,&quot; says designer Laurence Kemball-Cook, who this week installed a series of floor tiles in the school corridors that generate power from the students&apos; footfall. &quot;The more they walk, the more the school saves on its energy bills \u2013 although of course I don&apos;t condone running in the corridor.&quot; Made from a slender sandwich of rubber, taken from recycled lorry tyres, which conceals an integrated pressure pad, the Pavegen tiles convert the kinetic energy of each footstep into about four watts of power. It might not sound like much, but the 24 tiles now installed in the school are expected to generate enough energy to power LED lighting along the corridor as well as a series of mobile phone chargers, producing 100 watts at peak times. Pavegen, the company Kemball-Cook founded on graduating as an industrial design engineer from Loughborough University in 2009, estimates that the energy generated over one year would be enough to fully charge over 850 mobile phones or power an electric car to drive seven miles.            &quot;I first had the idea when watching the sheer number of people walking through Victoria station at rush hour,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought there must be a way to harvest all this potential energy going to waste.&quot; He had been working for a renewable energy company on street lighting powered by solar-panels and wind-turbines, but became increasingly sceptical about the usefulness of the technology for such applications. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of shade in cities,&quot; he says, &quot;and you don&apos;t get much useful wind until you&apos;re about 25 metres up in the air. That&apos;s a tall street light.&quot; After winning a Royal Society of Arts prize, he spent his final year at Loughborough developing what became the Pavegen tile, first exhibited at his graduation. &quot;It totally blew up,&quot; he says. &quot;There was so much interest from industry that I decided to set up my own company \u2013 I was approached by Westfield Stratford City and the Olympic Delivery Authority, so I got the chance to test the idea on big crowds.&quot; He installed 12 trial tiles at the entrance to West Ham station during the games, which generated enough energy during the day to power the station lighting by night. Attracting interest for temporary events, he then installed his invention on a dance floor at Bestival, which was able to charge 1,000 mobile phones as people krumped and twerked their way across the tiles. For a concert in Singapore, the tiles powered a cinema display, which projected tweets from the crowd. &quot;The idea is about much more than just energy creation,&quot; says the designer, explaining that each tile is fitted with a wifi transmitter, to beam information about its energy generation and location back to a central computer. &quot;I can see exactly what each part of the floor is doing at any one time, all from my phone,&quot; he says. &quot;And that data is gold.&quot;      Kemball-Cook clearly has his eyes on more than saving a school&apos;s energy bills. &quot;It could have really powerful applications in retail,&quot; he says. &quot;You could know exactly where the hotspots were on your shop floor, where people were shopping at what time of day. How people behave and move is the heartbeat of the high street.&quot; He says it could also be useful in entertainment spaces \u2013 monitoring how people move around casinos \u2013 as well as for fire safety, tracking where people are in a building, in real time. &quot;Way-finding, security lighting, controlling temperatures in buildings \u2013 in each case, monitoring from the floor tiles means you can measure with pin-point accuracy.&quot; As our cities are becoming increasingly smart, does such sentient flooring represent an entirely welcome step? In places like Masdar in Abu Dhabi and Songdo in South Korea, every urban function \u2013 from heating and lighting, to refuse collection, security and even driving \u2013 is now monitored and controlled by a central city brain. When everything is predicted and predictable, data-crunched and optimised, what place is there for the spontaneity and freedom of urban life \u2013 when even the surfaces we walk on are a tool for increasing our consumption? &quot;It&apos;s not just a commercial tool,&quot; says Kemball-Cook. &quot;Our ambition is to make this technology available to all communities around the world. We want every favela and slum, every new city and old building to be fitted with it.&quot; But just watch where you tread.

Barry Popkin and George Bray pointed the finger at high fructose corn syrup in soft drinks in 2004, causing a huge headache for the big manufacturers, including Coca-Cola and Pepsi. &quot;Smoothies and fruit juice are the new danger,&quot; said Popkin, a distinguished professor at the department of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, in an interview with the Guardian. He added: &quot;It&apos;s kind of the next step in the evolution of the battle. And it&apos;s a really big part of it because in every country they&apos;ve been replacing soft drinks with fruit juice and smoothies as the new healthy beverage. So you will find that Coke and Pepsi have bought dozens [of fruit juice companies] around the globe.&quot; In the UK, Coca-Cola owns Innocent smoothies while PepsiCo has Tropicana. Launching Tropicana smoothies in 2008, Pepsi&apos;s sales pitch was that the drink would help the nation to reach its five a day fruit and vegetable target. &quot;Smoothies are one of the easiest ways to boost daily fruit intake as each 250ml portion contains the equivalent of 2 fruit portions,&quot; it said at the time. However, Popkin says the five a day advice needs to change. Drink vegetable juice, he says, but not fruit juice. &quot;Think of eating one orange or two and getting filled,&quot; he said. &quot;Now think of drinking a smoothie with six oranges and two hours later it does not affect how much you eat. The entire literature shows that we feel full from drinking beverages like smoothies but it does not affect our overall food intake, whereas eating an orange does. So pulped-up smoothies do nothing good for us but do give us the same amount of sugar as four to six oranges or a large coke. It is deceiving.&quot; Nine years ago the two scientists had identified sugar-sweetened soft drinks, full of calories and consumed between meals, as a major cause of soaring obesity in developed countries. But they argue that as people change their drinking habits to avoid carbonated soft drinks, the potential damage from naturally occurring fructose in fruit juices and smoothies is being overlooked. All sugars are equal in their bad effects, says Popkin \u2013 even those described on cereal snack bars sold in health food shops as containing &quot;completely natural&quot; sweeteners. &quot;The most important issue about added sugar is that everybody thinks it&apos;s cane sugar or maybe beet sugar or HFC syrup or all the other syrups but globally the cheapest thing on the market almost is fruit juice concentrate coming out of China. It has created an overwhelming supply of apple juice concentrate. It is being used everywhere and it also gets around the sugar quotas that lots of countries have.&quot; In a survey of sweeteners in US food products between 2005 and 2009 for a paper published in 2012, Popkin and colleagues found that fruit juice concentrate was the fifth most common sugar overall and the second most common, after corn syrup, in soft drinks and in babies&apos; formula milk. More studies need to be done before governments and health bodies around the world will take notice. There are only two really good long-term trials \u2013 one in Singapore and one by Harvard, he says. &quot;But all the long term studies on fruit juice in anything show the same kind of effect whether it&apos;s a smoothie or natural [juice] and whether it&apos;s a diabetes or weight gain effect,&quot; Popkin added. Further evidence supporting the theory came last week from a study published by the British Medical Association. Researchers from the UK, USA and Singapore found that, in large-scale studies involving nurses, people who ate whole fruit, especially blueberries, grapes and apples, were less likely to get type 2 diabetes, which is obesity-related, but those who drank fruit juice were at increased risk. People who swapped their fruit juice for whole fruits three times a week cut their risk by 7%. Most of the attention from those concerned about growing obesity levels among children is still on soft drinks with added sugar, such as colas and lemonade, which are consumed in enormous quantities. In 2012 we drank nearly 227 litres of liquid each in the UK, according to the industry, which says 61% of those had no added sugar. Excluding water brings the &quot;no added sugar&quot; total to 54%. Fruit juices and smoothies are also included in the total. We each drank 17.6 litres of those. British health campaigners are calling for a soft drinks tax in the UK. In January Sustain published its Children&apos;s Future Fund report, saying that \u00a31bn a year could be raised from a tax of 20p a litre and invested in children&apos;s health programmes. It has been backed by more than 60 organisations and the first children&apos;s commissioner, Al Aynsley-Green, gave his support. In February the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges also called for the tax in its obesity report. The British Soft Drinks Association says that consumption of soft drinks containing added sugar has fallen by 9% over the last 10 years, while the incidence of obesity has risen by 15%. &quot;Obesity is a serious and complex problem requiring concerted action by a wide range of organisations as well as by people themselves. Soft drinks companies recognise the role they have to play,&quot; it said. Companies were reducing the calorie content of their drinks. PepsiCo, it said, had only advertised the no added sugar variants of its soft drinks since 2005. Innocent Smoothies claims that people who drink juice have better diets and lower rates of obesity than others, although the studies it cited had funding from the juice industry. &quot;Smoothies are made entirely from fruit and therefore contain the same amount of sugars that you would find in an equivalent amount of whole fruit,&quot; it said in a statement. Meanwhile, efforts by the soft drinks companies to grow the market continue. Coca-Cola in the UK this year declared its ambition to increase the market by \u00a32.1bn by 2017, identifying six &quot;moments&quot; in the day when we could be persuaded to buy more soft drinks, including fruit juice and smoothies for breakfast and soft drinks for children when they come home from school. Sales of sweetened Coca-Cola, containing nine teaspoons of sugar in a standard can, still outstrip those of Diet Coke and Zero Coke combined. &quot;Unless Coca-Cola drastically reduces its marketing for sugary drinks, its strategy to reach more people more often will mean that it pumps record levels of sugar into our diets,&quot; said Charlie Powell, campaigns director of Sustain. &quot;This is a business model that is unhealthy and unsustainable, perfectly highlighting the &apos;profit versus public health&apos; conflict of interest endemic in the sugary drinks industry.&quot; Coca-Cola argues that taxes do not change behaviour and that sugar should not be vilified. In a statement, it said: &quot;We believe that rather than single out any ingredient, it is more helpful for people to look at their total energy balance. This is because obesity and weight gain are caused by an imbalance in calories consumed and burnt off. Our products should be enjoyed as part of a sensible, balanced diet and healthy lifestyle that includes regular physical activity. &quot;For those that are watching their calorie intake, we offer a wide range of low or no calorie options, which represent more than one third of our sales.&quot; In an article this year in the journal Pediatric Obesity, Bray and Popkin review the issue 10 years on from their famous paper. &quot;The concern with HFCS in our diet has led to a reduced proportion of HFCS in beverages compared to other sugars,&quot; they say, but add &quot;this is a misplaced shift \u2026 fructose remains a major component of our global diet. To date, to the best of our knowledge every added amount of fructose \u2013 be it from fruit juice, sugar-sweetened beverages or any other beverage or even from foods with high sugar content \u2013 adds equally to our health concerns linked with this food component.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/07/tokyo-host-2020-olympic-games", "sentences": ["All three bidding cities replicated to a greater or lesser extent the model minted by London in Singapore in 2005, combining photogenic sports stars, a delegation of young people and glossy films designed to underscore ambition and certainty."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-07T21:12:29Z", "title": "Tokyo wins race to host 2020 Olympic Games", "tags": ["Shinzo Abe", "Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Olympic Games", "Sport", "Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "     Tokyo has won the race to host the 2020 Olympic Games after the Japanese prime minister flew in to personally reassure voters that radioactive leaks from the Fukushima power plant would not create a health risk. The intervention from Shinzo Abe helped the Japanese capital defeat Madrid and Istanbul in the race to host the Games after a campaign in which each of the three faced major economic or political challenges. A princess who rarely leaves Japan and a promise to combine fiscal responsibility with a passionate welcome also helped Tokyo win after two previous consecutive bid failures. There was drama when Madrid and Istanbul tied in the first round of voting, forcing a tie break among the 94 voters that ended with a narrow victory for the Turkish city. That left Tokyo&apos;s &quot;safe pair of hands&quot; up against Istanbul&apos;s expansive vision to unite east and west on the banks of the Bosphorus in the final round of voting, with the Japanese bid winning comprehensively by 60 votes to 36. IOC president Jacques Rogge, who will stand down on Tuesday after 12 years, congratulated Tokyo on its &quot;excellent bid&quot; and &quot;comprehensive&quot; victory. The Japanese capital, which last hosted the Games in 1964, had been the favourite to win during a turbulent bidding race in which the chances of the three candidates waxed and waned at various points. &quot;Here in Buenos Aires, we have received many voices of support and felt the passion from people in Japan. I am overjoyed to learn that our dream has come true,&quot; said Tokyo governor and bid chairman Naoki Inose. Abe declared himself happier than when he was elected. &quot;The moment of truth is coming and we&apos;d like to do our best to live up to your expectations,&quot; he said. The eruption of joy and tears from the Tokyo team in Buenos Aires, and the hundreds of Japanese media, was in stark contrast to the despair felt on the streets of Madrid and among the Istanbul delegation. Some supporters of the Spanish bid were furious. Tennis player Feliciano Lopez said it was a &quot;disgraceful decision&quot; that showed the IOC had &quot;no regard for fair play and values all other interests above sport&quot;. A combination of its promise to provide a safe harbour in turbulent economic times was considered a vote winner for Tokyo, but it was also able to demonstrate that its Games would be a passionate and fun-filled affair in an emotional final presentation. Previous Tokyo bids had been lauded for their practicality but lacked the warmth that propelled London&apos;s legacy-centric pitch to victory in 2005 and Rio to success in 2009. On both occasions, Tokyo also bid. Going into the last week, Tokyo was the strong favourite but its chances were undermined by ill-timed reports of new leaks at the power plant in Fukushima that was hit by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. On the back foot, the delegation was considered slow to respond, while Madrid seized the momentum through the charm of Crown Prince Felipe and its pitch to hold a low-cost Games in austere times. But Abe dealt with the issue head on and insisted &quot;emphatically and unequivocally&quot; that the radiation leaks had been contained and would pose no health risk. &quot;I ask you read through the headlines and appraise the true situation,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been no health-related problems, nor will there be in the future. I shall take responsibility.&quot; Abe charmed the IOC members with his memories of the opening ceremony of the 1964 Games, seen as a key moment in Japan&apos;s postwar history, and assurances the bid was economically sound. He said afterwards that staging the Games would allow Japan to repay the world for the assistance it gave the country in the wake of the natural disaster. Tokyo&apos;s presentation began with a surprise \u2013 the appearance of Princess Takamado, a Cambridge-educated member of the royal family who rarely leaves the country for reasons of protocol. She was followed by Paralympic long jumper Mami Sato, whose home town was hit by the tsunami, and powerfully described the power of sport to inspire. Sato, who lost her right leg to cancer at 19, described how 200 athletes visited areas affected by the tsunami to visit thousands of children. &quot;What we have seen is the impact of the Olympic values as never before in Japan. And what the country has witnessed is that those precious values \u2013 excellence, friendship and respect \u2013 can be so much more than just words,&quot; she said. Madrid attempted to trump Tokyo&apos;s royal card with one of its own but was narrowly defeated in a shock first round result. Prince Felipe, who competed as a sailor at the 1992 Barcelona Games, repeated the mantra that Madrid&apos;s bid &quot;made sense&quot; because 80% of the venues were already built. All three bidding cities replicated to a greater or lesser extent the model minted by London in Singapore in 2005, combining photogenic sports stars, a delegation of young people and glossy films designed to underscore ambition and certainty. But all faced major issues. Tokyo had to reassure voters in the face of alarming headlines about radioactive leaks, Madrid had to convince that its broken economy would not hobble its plans and Istanbul faced a string of problems including the reaction to the Taksim Square protests and a spate of doping scandals. The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, attempted to convince the IOC members that they should bring the event to &quot;the land of youth in the city of tolerance and peace&quot; for a Games that would &quot;truly embody the human spirit&quot;, but to no avail."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/08/sebastian-vettel-italian-grand-prix-f1", "sentences": ["Next up is the high downforce track at Singapore; Vettel won there last year and is expected to repeat his success on the street circuit in two weeks&apos; time."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-08T14:16:00Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel wins Italian Grand Prix to increase championship lead", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2013", "Motor sport", "Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "There are times when even hindsight is not 20-20 and Lewis Hamilton&apos;s immediate response to his failure at the Italian Grand Prix was far more accurate than his considered appraisal. Straight after Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull had all but confirmed that they would win this year&apos;s drivers&apos; and constructors&apos; Formula One world championships, Hamilton threw in the towel. His two points for ninth place, which left him 81 points behind Vettel with seven races to go, led him to conclude: &quot;It&apos;s been a disaster of a weekend. That&apos;s it for the championship.&quot; A little over an hour later, in a secluded corner of the Mercedes motorhome, and comforting his pet bulldog Roscoe, Hamilton had changed his mind. &quot;When I got out of the car I was angry and definitely thought that could be it,&quot; he said. &quot;But I&apos;ve been back with my engineers and I&apos;m not going to give up. I&apos;ve got to win every race basically. It is the tallest order but I&apos;m going to try.&quot; Hamilton clearly talks a lot more sense when he is angry than when he is in quiet repose. Either that or his engineers have been turning his head with fanciful notions. The Briton&apos;s chances of winning his second world championship are about as good as Roscoe&apos;s. They were first undermined by his poor qualifying performance on Saturday, when he failed to make Q3&apos;s top-10 shootout for the first time in 67 races. He started the race in 12th place and was hindered by first losing radio communication and then developing a slow puncture. After that, his considerable race pace, which included setting the quickest lap, was mostly meaningless. He said: &quot;I came here this morning energised, and drove harder than ever. I felt like I had nothing left in my heart at the end. I was angry, because it sucks when you do all that work, and everyone in the factory and the garage does all that work, and you only get two points after only making up three places. But that&apos;s the way it goes.&quot; When asked what he had to do to win the title, he blew out his cheeks and screwed up his eyes. &quot;I&apos;ve got to win every race but if [Vettel] finishes second in every race it will be impossible. It will be like climbing Mount Everest, without oxygen, running up it in swimming trunks. That&apos;s how tough it is. I don&apos;t know why I am in that frame of mind but there are still seven races to go. &quot;Whatever the case we have had an amazing year. It has blown me away, the fact that I have moved to a team and we have been so competitive. I hope we can take that positive energy into next year. I came to this team to win championships and I truly believe we can.&quot; Hamilton&apos;s positivity is shared by many. If Mercedes can match Red Bull&apos;s car under the 2014 regulations the strong possibility is that he will blow Vettel and everyone else away but that will not happen this year. Here in Italy, as was the case with the previous race at Spa, Red Bull have won races at venues where their car did not have a great record of success. Next up is the high downforce track at Singapore; Vettel won there last year and is expected to repeat his success on the street circuit in two weeks&apos; time. This was the German&apos;s third victory at Monza, his sixth of the season and the 32nd of his career. It was achieved on the world&apos;s fastest track, where he won for the first time five years ago. Even the booing he received on the podium for beating Ferrari&apos;s Fernando Alonso into second place could not wipe the smile from his champagne-splashed features; Hamilton received similar treatment when he won last year. Vettel said of the jeering: &quot;It is in their genes. Fernando was there and the tifosi support for Ferrari was natural. I said to the guys on the in-lap that the more booing we get the better we have done. That proved how strong we were. &quot;Maybe the people don&apos;t like to see the same driver, the same team, on the podium. I enjoy it as a team. There are a lot of Red Bulls fans. They are difficult to spot here, but if you look closely you can see blue caps.&quot; Vettel&apos;s win extended his lead over Alonso to 53 points and with Mark Webber achieving his first podium at this circuit, on his farewell to F1 in Europe it was a memorable weekend for the team principal Christian Horner, who will be 40 later this year and is also preparing to become a father. &quot;That is something I am looking forward to and is a bit of a game-changer,&quot; he said. &quot;In terms of the team&apos;s performance, we were very strong all weekend. We managed to make a fantastic double stop and then controlled the race. The only problem was the loss of pressure in Mark&apos;s gearbox. There are still 175 points available and things do change very quickly, so we will be pushing all the way to Brazil.&quot; Vettel made a good start from pole and was 6.6sec ahead by lap 18. It was a classic parade. Behind Webber, in fourth place, came Felipe Massa but there is some speculation that the performance may not be enough to save his job. Some say he had lost the support of Ferrari some days ago, when his advisers pushed the team for a new contract; Kimi Raikkonen and Nico H\u00fclkenberg are the alternatives. The team are thought to favour Raikkonen against the wishes of the president Luca Di Montezemola. It was a disappointing day for British supporters, with Jenson Button 10th and Paul Di Resta retiring on the first lap. Pirelli have been given a fresh contract, estimated to be worth \u00a350m, to provide tyres for Formula One for the next five years. This will end speculation that Michelin \u2013 the personal preference of Jean Todt, the president of the governing FIA \u2013 was ready to step in after too many exploding tyres this season, particularly during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in June."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/09/lewis-hamilton-red-bull-f1", "sentences": ["One race the other takes points off you and the next race you swap it and change it right to the end, like it was with Felipe [Massa] and myself in 2008.&quot; Hamilton has also said he believed that his fortunes might change with a return to the higher downforce tracks, starting with Singapore on 22 September, where he was impressive last year.", "&quot;Singapore is cool,&quot; he said.", "I&apos;m hoping for a positive race.&quot; The fact is that the next four races are in Singapore, South Korea, Japan and India, and Sebastian Vettel won the lot last year."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-09T21:30:00Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton sees no end soon to Red Bull's dominance of F1", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Red Bull", "Formula One 2013", "Mercedes GP", "Sebastian Vettel", "Ferrari", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Red Bull will continue to be a dominant force in Formula One for the foreseeable future, according to Lewis Hamilton, one of the many drivers who have had to live in the team&apos;s tall shadow for the past four seasons.

When Hamilton, who saw his remote championship chances disappear with a ninth place at Monza, was asked whether he thought it was only a matter of time before Red Bull would &quot;fall off their perch&quot; he said: &quot;No, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s going to happen. &quot;For the next four years coming, unless Renault do a poor engine, I think they&apos;ll be quick. [Designer] Adrian Newey does a really good job. Even though the car&apos;s a lot different next year, I believe you can take some of the things from this car into that car. So their car is still going to be pretty impressive next year. &quot;I just hope that, whatever the case, we all come out next year with a car we can battle each other with. And fight. One race the other takes points off you and the next race you swap it and change it right to the end, like it was with Felipe [Massa] and myself in 2008.&quot; Hamilton has also said he believed that his fortunes might change with a return to the higher downforce tracks, starting with Singapore on 22 September, where he was impressive last year. &quot;Singapore is cool,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve had some good races there. I hope when we go there I&apos;ll be stronger. I was leading there last time. I&apos;m hoping for a positive race.&quot; The fact is that the next four races are in Singapore, South Korea, Japan and India, and Sebastian Vettel won the lot last year. Red Bull tend to finish strongly and Vettel, who is 53 points ahead of his nearest challenger, Fernando Alonso, merely has to keep picking up points to nail his fourth straight title. Having won half the 12 races so far he does not need to win again. The good news for Mercedes and Ferrari is that they can join McLaren in moving their emphasis to their 2014 car. They all have to lift their game. Ferrari are expected to announce their drivers for 2014 within the next few days, with Kimi Raikkonen the favourite to replace Massa.

They are simultaneously criticised and lauded. And while few can agree on which methodology is the most robust, there is consensus that global university rankings are here to stay, that no ranking is all encompassing and that their influence is growing. Students, universities and governments are taking note and action. The first international rankings, the Academic Ranking of World Universities or Shanghai Rankings, were published in 2003 by Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China. These were initially used to establish the standing of Chinese universities internationally following the launch of a government initiative to create world-class universities. But in today&apos;s more internationalised sector, governments across the world are using rankings to measure their global competitiveness. The Shanghai Rankings were soon followed by the QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education World University Rankings. With students and academics facing greater options and opportunities, the existence of three ready-made lists of the world&apos;s best universities have heightened competition the world over and governments are now paying closer attention, even utilising rankings to make policy decisions.

The Brazilian government&apos;s national scholarship programme, Science Without Borders, aims to send 100,000 students and researchers in primarily STEM subject areas to some of the world&apos;s best institutions. These partner universities were selected based on their position in the QS and Times rankings. In an effort to ensure quality, India&apos;s University Grants Commission also requires any foreign university wanting to partner with Indian universities to be ranked among the top 500 in the world. University rankings are also impacting immigration policy. With the number of internationally mobile students projected to grow due to changing demographics and rising incomes in developing countries, overseas students are big business. They contributed over \u00a310bn to the UK economy in 2011-2012 alone. As a result the UK government is looking to attract 90,000 more overseas students by 2018. However, the current debate surrounding UK immigration policy has led to an increasingly negative perception among overseas students, making them feel &apos;unwelcome&apos;. This has led to a sharp decline in the number of Indian and Pakistani students studying in the UK. Immigration policy is also impacting the recruitment of top academics and researchers. France has capitalised on this and opened its borders to Indian students by easing visa restrictions. Other countries looking to improve their standings in the rankings have also opened their borders. Countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands have changed their immigration laws to favour those who have graduated from top global universities. In points based systems, graduates from the highest ranked universities in the QS, Times and Shanghai Rankings are awarded more points. In a bid to make itself more attractive to international academics and expatriates, Russian authorities recently instituted a new legislation that will recognise degrees from foreign universities that are among the top 300 inthese rankings. However, those students who have not graduated from top universities or from former Soviet republics (excluding Uzbekistan) will still need to undergo a lengthy certification process. This development is in line with other initiatives the Russian government is introducing to improve its global competitiveness, such as sending more students abroad to study at elite universities. Russia is also taking steps to overhaul its own higher education sector as a result of its poor performance in the global university rankings. Following an independent audit of its universities, 15 were selected to receive special grants to improve their compliance with rankings criteria. Other countries such as Germany, France, Japan and Singapore have introduced similar programmes to improve their higher education systems and build world-class universities. In Asia in particular, the university rankings have created a &apos;reputation race&apos;, which sees both universities and governments closely monitoring the changing criteria for university rankings. Making policy decisions based on university rankings is not a simple process. Global university rankings have their limitations. The indicators and criteria used are not all encompassing and often measured via proxies. There is a greater overall emphasis on research than teaching, despite the context of rising tuition fees, when prospective students are looking for the complete package. This emphasis also puts universities that are more focused on the arts and humanities at a disadvantage due to the heavy weighting of citations to measure research influence. Much of the controversy surrounding the university rankings concerns their methodologies and which is the most robust \u2013 or, conversely, most gameable. There are various shortcuts universities can take to improve their scores such as taking on part-time professors that are highly cited. Ultimately, university rankings are a tool. When using a particular ranking, it is important to be aware of its limitations as well as its intended audience. While QS design their rankings primarily for students, other rankings are aimed more overtly at university leadership. Any list only highlights a small percentage of the world&apos;s universities and as a result, many institutions, particularly in developing countries, are at a distinct disadvantage. Like them or loathe them, however, university rankings seem to be here to stay. In Asia and Latin America, companies have begun to produce regional rankings. And with US president Barack Obama planning to create his own own &apos;Obamarank&apos; league table of US universities in an attempt to nudge down the cost of college education, the global interest in ranking higher education only looks set to grow.

My passion for science traces back to TV shows like Johnny Ball Reveals All and Tomorrow&apos;s World. But I realised that I wasn&apos;t cut out to be a researcher during my masters in biochemistry. Despite achieving early success \u2013 including joint authorship of an article in Science \u2013 I got frustrated by the volume of failed experiments. I nonetheless managed to find a way to indulge my love of science and joined the civil service as a science graduate entrant. I&apos;ve worked in a range of areas, from negotiating EU science funding to helping the science minister. Since 2007, I have represented UK science interests in China and Southeast Asia, heading up the joint Foreign Office-BIS Science and Innovation Network in Asia Pacific. What does a typical day at work look like? What kind of projects are you working on? My job is to communicate the value that our world-class science and innovation system brings to the UK economy and society. We use a range of approaches, including the media, speeches and, increasingly, digital channels. The UK is outstanding in science and innovation, so a large part of my job is to choose the most powerful examples. Some of the best stories come from the interfaces between academia and industry. For example, BIS partner organisations, including several research councils and the technology strategy board, have combined their investments in hi-tech salmon breeding technologies. Scotland earns \u00a31bn annually from salmon exports and this technology will help reduce losses of stocks to parasites. What is your biggest challenge? It&apos;s really easy to get carried away by the science and use technical vocabulary and indecipherable acronyms. This is a sure-fire way to switch off any audience. To avoid that pitfall it&apos;s important to repeatedly sense-check my work. When I get stuck, I ask the question: &quot;How would I describe this to my mum?&quot; The ultimate challenge is to actually put that to the test and call her. And your biggest achievement in your career to date? A highlight from China was helping to secure \u00a3170m in innovation deals for UK companies. These ranged from satellite imaging technology all the way through to baby feeding bottles that change colour when they are too hot. My proudest moment was being labelled the most active overseas diplomat by Singapore&apos;s equivalent to our science minister. How is scientists&apos; research used by civil servants? Scientific research is used right across the civil service and we all benefit from the impacts. Clinical trials in hospitals determine which medicines are deemed safe and effective for use throughout the NHS. Met office data drives climate change policymaking in the Department for Energy and Climate Change. And data from the Natural Environment Research Council was used to decide when it was safe to resume flights after the volcanic ash cloud in 2010. The chief scientific officer has previously said that there needs to be a cultural shift to integrate science and engineering into everyday government. Is there a feeling that science skills are undervalued in the civil service?  I think science skills are highly valued in the civil service. For talented scientists wanting to remain in the lab or field, there are exciting options like the British Antarctic Survey, Met office and Food and Environment Research Agency. For people like me who want to work in science policy and communications, there are lots of excellent opportunities in Whitehall, devolved administrations and beyond. The Government Science and Engineering Network plays an important role in connecting us all together through events, news and information. UK science spending is to remain flat, though funds going into lab infrastructure will almost double. Are we being overtaken by countries investing more aggressively in their research base?\u00a0 The facts tell quite a different story \u2013 the UK is leading the global race in science and research. With 1% of the world&apos;s population, we publish 6% of global research and 14% of the highest quality research. We also have the most efficient research system of all the G8 countries. So for every pound or dollar we invest, we get more high quality research out. If that&apos;s not punching above our weight I don&apos;t know what is. That said, we cannot be complacent. Despite enormous economic pressure the \u00a34.6bn annual budget for science and research has been protected. A key part of\u00a0the government&apos;s industrial strategy is supporting technologies where our research strengths and business capabilities combine.\u00a0Last autumn, the Chancellor highlighted Eight Great Technologies where the UK can lead the world, announcing\u00a0an additional \u00a3600m\u00a0investment to\u00a0help support their development.\u00a0 How can we encourage more girls to take up STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects?\u00a0 We really want to inspire more girls, minority and disadvantaged groups to study and choose STEM careers. BIS is partnering with industry to showcase passionate young engineers working on exciting hi-tech fashion designs such as robotic dresses, to inspire girls to look at the science behind clothes. We know that young women often care about the environment and the world we live in. This is why we are highlighting young female engineers doing groundbreaking environmental engineering work in Latin America on earthquake prevention and water sanitation. Look out for a programme of exciting activities and competitions as part Tomorrow&apos;s Engineers Week, which runs from 4-8 November. You&apos;ve just joined Twitter \u2013 why would you recommend it to other civil servants? Any tips? Yes \u2013 you can find me @myerscsam. I liken my progress to that of my dad learning to program the first family video recorder \u2013 slow but determined. I have found Twitter to be a rich source of information and comment that I wasn&apos;t picking up through other channels. Our permanent secretary is already on there @MDonnellyBIS. But it&apos;s not for everyone and there are other options to consider, such as LinkedIn. The civil service is actively embracing social media and the Government Communication Network has a helpful &quot;how to&quot; guide. What is your leadership style?\u00a0 I&apos;m really drawn to three S&apos;s: strategy, staff and stakeholders. Success comes when we set the right direction, motivate the team, and bring the right partners along with us.\u00a0I would add a fourth: scientific rigour, which drives my decision making. What three things would you take to a desert island? My wind-up radio: invented in Britain. My British designed and powered iPad. And some broccoli, which British scientists tell me will ward off arthritis.

Judge Yogesh Khanna delivered the verdict on Tuesday morning shortly after noon local time at the district court of Saket in south Delhi. &quot;I convict all of the accused. They have been found guilty of gang rape, unnatural offences, destruction of evidence \u2026 and for committing the murder of the helpless victim,&quot; Khanna said. The bus cleaner Akshay Kumar Singh, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh will be sentenced on Wednesday and are likely to face death by hanging, though life imprisonment is a possibility. Their lawyers said they would appeal. With tears in her eyes and wearing a pink sari, the mother of the 23-year-old victim \u2013 who cannot be identified under Indian law \u2013 sat just a few feet from the four men who stood against a wall in the court as Khanna read the verdict. Outside the courthouse, where dozens of protesters had gathered, a chant began quickly after the verdict: &quot;Hang them! Hang them! Hang them!&quot; The trial of the men, aged between 19 and 34, started in January. One defendant, a bus driver, hanged himself in prison in March. The oldest of the six men accused of the attack on the physiotherapy student, he was alleged by police to have been the ringleader. The youngest among the alleged attackers, who was 17 at the time of the assault, was tried separately and was last month sentenced to three years in a juvenile reform home \u2013 the maximum possible punishment under Indian law. The incident, which took place on a Sunday night in Delhi in December 2012, provoked outrage in India with protests across the country. It also led to an unprecedented national discussion about sexual violence and calls for widespread changes in cultural attitudes and policing, and legal reform. The international image of the country was damaged, with numbers of female tourists dropping significantly. The victim&apos;s father, Badrinath Singh, told the Guardian he wanted the case to set an example to other women in India, where there has been a wave of sexual violence in recent years. &quot;I want other girls and women to know how brave my daughter was so her sacrifice does not go ashamed,&quot; Singh, 48, said shortly before the verdict. Since the attack laws have been tightened and pledges made to improve the investigation and processing of sexual violence cases. Vrinda Grover, a well-known activist, said the challenge was to make any changes &quot;institutional&quot;. &quot;There is certainly much higher awareness now\u00a0\u2026 but the Indian system has huge inertia,&quot; she said. Much of the trial was held behind closed doors, with media excluded for many months. The men arrived at the courtroom on Tuesday morning wearing hoods to avoid photographers. The mother of the victim, who suffered severe internal injuries when repeatedly violated with an iron bar, had called for all those guilty to be hanged, whatever their age. &quot;It has to be the death penalty,&quot; she told reporters earlier this week. Singh, the victim&apos;s father, told the Guardian earlier this year that the family would push for a harsher sentence by any means possible in India and internationally. All the men denied charges of rape, murder and destroying evidence. Two said they had been to listen to a music concert in a park on the night of the attack. One said he was driving the bus in which the assault took place and did not take therefore directly take part in the assault. A fourth, a 26-year-old drifter, said he had left Delhi for his village. Police have said the juvenile convicted last month was the most violent of the attackers of the girl. The prosecution case relied on testimony from 85 witnesses, a statement given by the victim before she died, DNA samples, dental records from bite marks on the victim&apos;s body that matched the teeth of some of the men and the evidence of her male friend, who was also badly beaten in the attack. The victim&apos;s friend described how the couple were attacked after boarding the bus on the way home from an evening movie at an upscale shopping mall. The attackers beat the man and raped the woman, police and doctors told the court. The victims were eventually dumped on a roadside layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. Her ashes were later scattered in the Ganges river, near her ancestral village in rural India. The men were also found guilty of robbing another man earlier in the evening of the incident. Police described how the six had set out from the Singh brothers&apos; home in a bus on a &quot;joy ride&quot;. They then tricked the victim and her friend into boarding the bus and assaulted them shortly afterwards. There has been widespread criticism of the fast-track court set up specifically to ensure rapid justice in the case, which is one of the most high-profile in India for many years. The trial of the adult defendants started in January. The victim&apos;s father has said the idea of a fast-track court was a farce. &quot;This case should have wound up within a month after it started \u2026 We have waited so long. We don&apos;t want it to be for nothing,&quot; he said. Gang-rapes, acid attacks and other acts of violence against women continue to be reported every day across India. In one recent incident a photojournalist was raped repeatedly by a group of men in a disused building in the commercial capital, Mumbai. The men have since been arrested. The victim of the attack was widely praised for her courage in complaining to police and identifying her attackers. Rape victims in India often prefer to remain silent rather than risk social ostracism, and sexual harassment remains a daily reality for Indian women. &quot;Every day I take trains, buses and rickshaws and every day I get harassed one way or another. Last week it was a boy of only nine years old. We have to stand up to them. No one will take the first step unless you take it yourself,&quot; said Shurbhi Sharma, a 19-year-old student in Mumbai. In the Delhi case, defence lawyers said police &quot;tortured&quot; and beat their clients into making confessions. Such abuse is systemic in India. &quot;He was crying. He said: &apos;Mum, mum, do something. Get me out of here. I never did anything wrong. I don&apos;t understand what is happening to me,&apos;&quot; Champa Sharma, mother of the defendant Vinay Sharma, said this weekend. It is hoped fast-track courts such as the one where this trial was held will help improve a poor conviction rate. Many families of victims pressure their relatives who have been assaulted not to press charges, police often refuse to file cases for those who do, witnesses are systematically intimidated and courts rarely deliver swift justice in the few cases that are filed. Indian courts had a backlog of 33m cases as of 2011."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/delhi-gang-rape-india-women", "sentences": ["She never opened her eyes again.&quot; Four days later, J died in a clinic in Singapore, where she had been moved as no facilities for treatment that would even give her a chance of life existed in India."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-10T10:12:00Z", "title": "Delhi rape: how India's other half lives", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "Society", "Women", "Life and style", "Equality"], "article": "It was a Sunday evening routine: heavy drinking, some rough, rustic food, and then out in the bus, cruising Delhi&apos;s streets looking for &quot;fun&quot;. This particular Sunday, 16 December last year, was like many others for Ram and Mukesh Singh, two brothers living in a slum known as Ravi Das Colony. The &quot;fun&quot;, on previous occasions, had meant a little robbery to earn money for a few bottles of cheap whisky and for the roadside prostitutes who work the badly lit roads of the ragged semi-urban, semi-rural zones around the edges of the sprawling Indian capital. However, this Sunday evening was to end not with a &quot;party&quot;, as one of the men later called their habitual outings, but with the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman. The incident was to prompt a global outcry and weeks of protests in India, and to reveal problems often ignored by those overseas who are perhaps too eager to embrace a heartwarming but simplistic narrative of growing prosperity in the world&apos;s biggest democracy. If sympathy lay, naturally, with the 23-year-old physiotherapist who was the victim of the attack, fascination focused on her assailants. These were not serial sex criminals, psychopaths or brutalised men from the margins of society. Their backgrounds were, perhaps more worryingly, like those of tens of millions of Indian men. Nor was Ravi Das Colony &quot;the underbelly&quot; of the Indian capital, as one local newspaper described it. A few hundred homes crammed on to a patch of land flanked by a road, a temple and a recently restored medieval tomb, it lies like an outpost of another, poorer India amid the relatively well-off suburbs to the south of the city. Like hundreds of other settlements across the metropolis, all founded by squatting migrants, who have been drawn to Delhi for decades, its single-room homes are overcrowded and noisy, but its doorsteps are swept clean each night and, though police venture rarely into its narrow lanes, order is maintained by the knowledge that almost every act, even the most intimate, will be instantly known to the entire community. For Ram and Mukesh Singh, 34 and 26 years old, Ravi Das Colony had been home for most of their lives. Ram earned a living as the driver of a bus that, albeit without the necessary permits, carried schoolchildren.     Ram Singh, who led the attack, according to his fellow accused. He died in police custody. The police said he killed himself; his family disputes this    Ram&apos;s brother, fired from a dozen jobs, intermittently drove a taxi. The two had grown up on a small homestead in Karauli, a remote eastern part of the state of Rajasthan, five hours by train from the capital. They attended a local school with few facilities and an often absent teacher, playing in the fields and dried riverbeds. They came to Delhi in 1997. India was then beginning to boom after the reforms of the early 1990s injected a new capitalist energy into the sclerotic, quasi-socialist-quasi-feudal economy, and their landless labourer parents decided to try their luck in the capital.     Percentage of Indian population living in urban areas    But if life in the city was better than the brutal poverty of the village, the improvement was only marginal. After a decade, their father and mother returned to Karauli and the brothers stayed on in a one-room brick home, brutally hot in the heat of the summer, freezing in winter. Ram, a slim, dark, small man, married a woman with three children by another man. She died of cancer shortly afterwards without bearing him a child of his own. After her death, he started drinking heavily and fighting. When he drove his bus into a lorry, he damaged an arm permanently. (Ram later appeared on one of India&apos;s hugely popular reality shows, angrily accusing his former employer of refusing him compensation for his injury. The bus owner accused him of being negligent and rash.) Though they left local girls alone, the Singh brothers were known among their neighbours for drunkenness, petty crime and occasional, unpredictable violence. The younger brother, Mukesh, was personable, if impressionable, according to teenagers in the neighbourhood. &quot;He was fine on his own but different when he was with his brother,&quot; one said, speaking a few days after the incident that would make the pair, if only for a short time, globally infamous.     Ratio of Indian children aged under six    Ram Singh spent the afternoon of 16 December visiting relatives elsewhere in the city, returning home at about 5pm. The day before, a 17-year-old drifter who had worked with him a year previously as an assistant on his bus had come to collect a debt of 6,000 rupees (\u00a370). The money was not ready and, with little else to do, the teenager had stayed on, sleeping on the bare floor of the small house. Also staying was another young man, 28-year-old Akshay Thakur, who eked out a living helping Ram Singh on his bus, and had no home of his own.     India and Pakistan income, GDP per capita    Both the 17-year-old, known as Raju, and Thakur had their own troubled histories. Their paths had taken them through a side of India that has less to do with the emerging economic powerhouse of international repute and more to do with a tenacious, older India riven by conflict, poverty, chaos and random violence. The eldest of five children, Raju was born to a destitute day labourer with mental health issues and his wife in a village 150 miles east of Delhi, in the vast northern state of Uttar Pradesh which has 180 million inhabitants and socio-economic indicators often worse than those in sub-Saharan Africa. As in rural Rajasthan, where the Singh brothers came from, women in the countryside of Uttar Pradesh suffer systematic sexual harassment and often violence. Rape is common and gang rape frequent. Victims are habitually blamed for supposedly enticing their attackers. Many are forced to marry their assailants; others kill themselves rather than live with the social stigma of being &quot;dishonoured&quot;. Police rarely register a complaint, let alone investigate. When only 10 or 11 years old, Raju was sent from his village home for Delhi. Though for some time he intermittently sent his parents money, they had no idea where he was. According to Raju&apos;s statement to police, the country boy had found food, shelter and a meagre wage as a dishwasher and server in a cheap dhaba, or roadside foodstall, in a rough neighbourhood called Trilokpuri, on the margins of the city&apos;s sprawl across the northern bank of the stinking, if still holy, river Yamuna. Created as a new home for slum dwellers cleared from Delhi&apos;s old city in the 1970s, Trilokpuri is another zone of transition, still halfway between the urban and the rural, where buffalo graze amid plastic bags and rubbish in the wastelands that separate new, poorly built cement blocks of flats.     Age of Indian population    After six months at a stall, sleeping below the tables and eating leftovers, Raju found work as a milkman&apos;s assistant before returning to washing dishes, this time at a dhaba serving Delhi&apos;s favourite street food of chole bhatura, spiced chickpeas. Finally he pitched up at a third establishment where the owner remembers a hardworking, slight and personable young man liked by the hundreds of customers, mainly rickshaw drivers, who each day paid 20 or 30 rupees for a bowl of beef curry with thick, rustic bread.     Delhi police inspect the bus believed to be the vehicle in which the woman was gang-raped. The suspects tried to run her over after throwing her off the bus.  Photograph: Strdel/AFP    Raju earned 3,000 rupees a month but left in the summer of 2011 after Ram Singh, who was a regular at the dhaba, asked him to work as an assistant on his bus. After a few months he moved on again, taking a job as a cleaner at a bus station in the south of Delhi where he slept in empty vehicles but remained friends with the man from Ravi Das Colony. He had stopped sending money home and his parents, back in his remote native village, believed he was dead. The fourth man sharing the food and cheap whisky in the Singh brothers&apos; home in Ravi Das Colony that Sunday evening was Akshay Thakur, who also came from a distant village deep in a desperately poor and conservative part of India. He, too, had left his home, 80 miles from Patna, the state capital of Bihar, for Delhi, though his journey was less direct, taking him five years and a variety of poorly paid, often physically arduous jobs such as working in brick kilns and selling illegal home-brewed &quot;country liquor&quot; before he ended up replacing Raju, working on Ram Singh&apos;s bus. The four men were thus all representative of a substantial element of contemporary Indian society. (The median age in India is 25, with two-thirds of the 1.2 billion population under 35.) They were semi-skilled and poorly educated, like so many other products of the country&apos;s failing education systems. They were migrants from the country to the town \u2013 four of the millions of individuals who over recent decades have converted an almost entirely rural country into an increasingly urbanised one. They were unmarried in a part of India where men outnumber women and gender imbalances are worsening. They were drinking in a city known for high levels of alcohol abuse. There was nothing very extraordinary about them. Yet within hours they would commit acts that would prompt outrage across the planet. At about 8pm, after the &quot;party&quot; had been going for nearly three hours, Ram Singh was called by the owner of the bus he drove for a living, and asked to buy a cylinder of cooking gas. He turned to his friends and, according to Raju&apos;s statement to the police, said: &quot;Let&apos;s go out and have some fun.&quot;     Delhi's sclerotic roads. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The men headed for the bus, which was parked 100 metres or so away on a side road, the statement says. On the way, they called on friends in the slum to join them. Two did: Pawan Gupta, a 19-year-old fruit seller and student, and Vinay Sharma, 20, who worked part-time in an expensive gym as a cleaner-cum-instructor. Both lived with their parents and had marginally more stable backgrounds than the others but were still far from exceptional in any obvious way. Gupta, a relative said, had grown up in a temple in the remote rural town of Basti in north-eastern Uttar Pradesh, another desperately poor part of India. He had given up further education to come to Delhi to help his parents run their fruit stall. Still only 20, he was hoping to go to college. He had &quot;fallen in with the wrong sort&quot;, a relative said. Sharma, the son of an airport cleaner, was doing a distance-learning college course in communications and gave his parents the rest of the 5,000 rupees he earned each month at the gym catering to Delhi&apos;s elite a few miles away. Such a stark proximity between the very wealthy and the less well-off, between the aspirant and the arrived, is also typical of the new India. Driven by Mukesh Singh, the bus first headed north-east, along Delhi&apos;s choked, congested inner ring road. The city has two such routes, both haphazardly planned and often gridlocked. The men pulled up at designated bus stops, where one of them \u2013 Raju, according to police \u2013 called out for anyone wanting a ride to Nehru Place, a shopping centre and office complex a few miles away. It was already dark and cold.     Badri Nath, left, father of the gang-rape victim, and her brother Gaurav at a press conference. Photograph: Mail Today/India Today/Getty    After about 10 minutes and several attempts to attract custom at different bus stops, a carpenter on his way home from work got on. Ram Singh shut the doors immediately behind him, and his brother accelerated away. Within minutes, the man had been beaten and robbed of his phone and 1,400 rupees, then dumped from the moving vehicle. He did not bother reporting the crime. By 8.30pm, after another few abortive attempts to lure passengers aboard, the bus pulled up at a stop in a suburb called Munirka. To make the trap more effective, Sharma, Gupta and Thakur sat on different seats at the front of the vehicle, posing as passengers, and visible from outside through the open doors. Raju stood on the step of the bus. &quot;For Palam crossing and Dwarka sector one,&quot; he shouted. Work like a horse, live like a saint Drive into Dwarka and the ragged reality of India&apos;s journey to prosperity is very obvious. A narrow flyover takes a stream of vehicles over a railway where packed trains pass slowly between strips of wasteland strewn with rubbish, faeces, and thin-ribbed cows. Everywhere there are people: labourers streaming from their makeshift huts to work on a series of unfinished, skeletal luxury flats that will be sold to the newly wealthy; women buying or carrying baskets of vegetables; schoolchildren in neat uniforms; young men doing little except play with their mobile phones; some beggars. Above soar billboards, advertising a conference with a &quot;real estate guru&quot;, a &quot;women&apos;s day&quot; at a local gym where &quot;cut-price classes&quot; will &quot;make him love your curves&quot;, and one poster composed of vast portraits of Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and the former president APJ Abdul Kalam, the &quot;father&quot; of India&apos;s nuclear programme. One of the most striking elements of the Delhi gang-rape case is the similarity in the backgrounds of the victim and of her killers. The family of &quot;J&quot; \u2013 it is illegal under Indian law to name a rape victim \u2013 were, like those of her assailants, from close to the bottom of India&apos;s still tenacious caste hierarchy. Her father, Badri Nath, like the Singh brothers&apos; father, had left his remote ancestral village for the capital in search of a better life. In 1982, a bus took him from his village on the banks of the Ganges in the middle of India&apos;s northern plains to a station where he bought a ticket for an overnight train to a city he had never seen. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to leave,&quot; he said simply. But he had little choice. Badri Nath was one of four brothers. The two eldest had been educated but funds were short and insufficient for Badri Nath to finish his schooling. His father was the only son of a man who himself was one of four sons. The family land, once enough to support a number of families, had thus been divided so many times that it was insufficient to provide a living even for one. Three years after he left the fields behind, his wife, who married when she was only 15, came to join him in Delhi.     Waiting for a bus in Delhi in front of an ad for the city. If life in the capital is better than village poverty, the gains for many have been marginal. Photo: Kevin Frayer/AP    In the city, Badri Nath managed to keep food on the table and a roof over the head of his young family. This was no mean achievement. In the mid-1980s, the Indian economy was still weak. The country was apparently locked into the &quot;Hindu growth rate&quot;. Communal violence was rife, opportunities few. He started polishing pressure cookers, then worked in a washing machine factory. A sympathetic boss gave him money for a small plot of land in what was then the semi-rural suburb of Dwarka and he built a very modest, cramped two-room home there. He took on a second job as a night watchman in a hospital. Slowly, over the years, the district developed. Electricity was connected, though problems with water supply never seemed to be resolved. More and more people flowed in from the rural areas. A decade passed, then another. Dwarka turned into a small town, then a small city, one of the many that fuse with the metropolis of Delhi itself. Economic development, accelerating steadily as the years passed, meant a newly monied middle class, and new airlines to take them to business meetings and beaches. Delhi&apos;s airport expanded. New workers were needed, and Badri Nath, through a friend, found work as a loader, emptying planes he would never fly in of baggage as they came in from Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Kolkata or elsewhere. He signed up for two eight-hour shifts, each one earning 100 rupees. He left home at 1pm and got home at 6am. The journey to work took 15 minutes in an unlicensed taxi, often vehicles driven by chauffeurs making some money on the side after dropping their employers off at the airport. Getting home took half an hour in an overcrowded bus. &quot;I heard once that to escape poverty you need to work like a horse and live like a saint,&quot; Badri Nath said later. &quot;That is what I have tried to do all my life.&quot;     Interactive: the events of 16 December 2012. Click on the image to launch it    His first child was a boy who died after three days. In India, sons are prized to the point where they receive not only scarce financial resources for their education but also better food. Female foetuses are selectively aborted so frequently that Delhi and the states around it suffer a massive demographic imbalance between men and women. Badri Nath thought differently, however. &quot;My wife was so sad when we had another child, we did not care if it was a boy or a girl. We just wanted it to survive,&quot; he said. The child was J, and she was followed over eight years by two boys. All three children went to the local government school, but it was J who stood out. &quot;She just needed to look at something once and she remembered it,&quot; said Badri Nath. Her textbooks lined a wall in the small home. To give her space to study and sleep, the rest of the family ate and slept in the second bedroom, covering a bed with a plastic sheet to convert it into a dining table. &quot;The only thing that interested her was studies,&quot; her father remembered. She covered the wall of her room not with Bollywood posters or pages from magazines but diagrams laboriously copied from her textbooks. Her handwriting and written English were soon the best in the family \u2013 her parents still conversed in the Bhojpuri language of their part of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 and it was J who filled in all the myriad administrative documents that blight every Indian&apos;s dealings with government. If there was any time left after studying, she helped neighbour&apos;s children in exchange for a few rupees or watched television on the family&apos;s cable connection. She had wanted to be a doctor, ideally a neurosurgeon, but opted instead for the more modest, and more affordable, ambition of physiotherapist and found a college in the northern city of Dehradun where she could qualify after a four-year course. To raise the 40,000-rupee annual fee, her father sold part of his land in his village and mortgaged the rest. To cover living expenses \u2013 a similar sum \u2013 J found a job in a call centre in the city. It was through a mutual friend at the call centre that she met Awindra Pandey, the 28-year-old information technology specialist who was with her on the night of the attack. The two were &quot;just friends&quot;, J&apos;s father said, though he often spoke to the young man on the telephone and liked him. There was no question of the pair marrying as they came from different sides of what, in India, remains an unbridgeable gulf. Pandey&apos;s family were from the upper castes and his father was a wealthy lawyer. He had a good salaried job \u2013 only a quarter of working Indians are employed in the formal sector \u2013 as an IT specialist. But if there would never have been a match, there could at least be companionship. The couple had been seeing each other for over a year and had even been on a trip to the hills together. They had not seen each other for more than month however before the attack. It was J, back in Delhi to look for an internship as a physiotherapist, who called her friend to suggest a trip to the cinema. Pandey picked her up from home and they travelled to Saket Mall, an upmarket shopping centre in the south of Delhi, where they watched Life of Pi at a multiplex, leaving at about 8.30pm. They walked out past the western-branded clothes shops and supermarkets, the new coffee bars, the car rank where drivers pull up in imported 4x4s, which they then load with shopping as their employer settles on the back seats, past the uniformed security guards, into the darkness of the evening, and started looking for transport home. This was a different India from that which J&apos;s father had known.     Women light candles in memory of J at an impromptu shrine in Delhi. The brutal crime triggered unprecedented protests, even as subsequent rapes pushed the student's death off the front pages.  Photograph: EPA    Jugaad Delhi&apos;s public transport is grossly inadequate at the best of times. If the reforms of the 1990s unleashed the power of the private sector, for good or ill, they did little to bolster the public sector. Since, public services and institutions, under increasing pressure, have not just failed to keep pace but have often in effect collapsed. So even a new and expanding metro in Delhi has barely made a difference in the seething city. As ever in India, where the state fails, jugaad (&quot;frugal innovation&quot;) takes over. Unlicensed buses are broadly tolerated, or at least allowed to run, after paying a small bribe to avoid a fine. On this Sunday night there were no official Delhi Metropolitan Corporation buses to take J and Pandey back to Dwarka. No auto-rickshaw wanted such a distant fare either. The couple convinced one driver to take them two miles from the mall to another bus stop, at Munirka, where they hoped to find more options to get back to Dwarka so Pandey could see J safely home. According to Pandey&apos;s statement to police, the couple had been waiting only a few minutes when the bus driven by Mukesh Singh pulled up with the juvenile leaning from the open door calling out its destination. &quot;Where are you going, didi?&quot; he asked the woman, using the colloquial Hindi for elder sister, police statements say. The couple got in and sat down, falling for the ruse that the men posing as passengers had prepared. &quot;How long will it take?&quot; Pandey asked. &quot;Not too long,&quot; replied Ram Singh. His brother, Mukesh, was still at the wheel. One of the other men, still playing his role, asked the same question. &quot;Let&apos;s get going,&quot; Ram Singh said as his assistant Thakur took 20 rupees as a fare from the couple. The bus moved off. Within minutes, as the bus drove along Delhi&apos;s outer ring road in the direction of the international airport, the atmosphere darkened. &quot;What are you doing out roaming around with a girl on her own?,&quot; Ram Singh asked Pandey, according to the accounts given to investigators by both the juvenile and the man. &quot;None of your business,&quot; the young IT engineer answered. The two men faced off. Ram Singh threw a punch. Then events moved very fast. Ram Singh and the others wrestled Pandey to the floor. One shouted: &quot;The rod, [get] the rod.&quot; As the woman screamed for help, banging on the bus&apos;s curtained windows, a metal bar kept in the bus was passed back. Blows rained down on the helpless man, now pinned between two seats. He was stripped. &quot;I was trying very hard to get to her but they had me nailed down,&quot; Pandey later told a magistrate. As Mukesh Singh drove the bus through the heavy traffic, Thakur and Ram Singh had dragged the woman to its back seats, according to the men&apos;s statements to police after their arrest. &quot;They beat her and pressed a hand over her mouth and tore her clothes off,&quot; the juvenile&apos;s statement says. &quot;Ram Singh first raped her, the girl kept shouting, and one by one all of us [raped her] and [Ram Singh] and the rest of us bit her body.&quot; Medical reports reveal bite marks were found on the woman&apos;s breasts, arms and genitals. J fought back, biting and scratching but the petite young woman had little chance. Outside the bus, the landmarks of south Delhi passed: a temple, a flyover, a busy road junction. At Mahipalpur, a scruffy collection of cheap hotels and restaurants near the airport, they turned the bus round, heading back into the city. It was 9.34pm, according to CCTV images. The vehicle had passed through three police checkpoints, where officers from the city&apos;s overstretched, badly paid, badly trained and badly equipped force stood supposedly keeping an eye on passing traffic. As the bus headed back into the city, the attack continued. Ram Singh exchanged places with Mukesh who had been driving. His brother then took his turn to rape the woman. &quot;We tried to push our [penises] into her mouth. We also tried to [sodomise] her,&quot; the juvenile later told police. His statement, corroborated by the account given by the victim to medical staff, does not mention the assault with the iron bar the woman described. Her medical examination \u2013 and the retrieval of two blood-stained rods in the bus \u2013 confirm that it was penetration by this that caused massive damage to her genitals, uterus and intestines. &quot;The girl was shrieking and shouting so much. Ram Singh put his hand inside her and pulled out flesh. The girl lost consciousness and started bleeding,&quot; the juvenile told police. Her friend later described how, naked and badly injured himself, he heard the men talking. One said that he thought &quot;she was dead&quot;. Another, possibly Thakur, suggested throwing them out of the bus. By this time \u2013 at exactly 9.54pm, according to images recorded by cameras \u2013 the bus had turned around once again and had returned to Mahipalpur. The men dragged their two semi-conscious victims, by the hair according to police documents, to the rear doors of the vehicle but these were jammed shut so they pushed the couple through the front doors. An attempt appears to have been made to run them over, but Pandey, though badly injured, was able to drag the woman out of the way. The bus then disappeared into the traffic and back into the city. When they reached Ravi Das Colony, the men parked the bus down a nearby alley. With water fetched from one of the colony&apos;s two standpipes, they sluiced it down with water to get rid of the blood, faeces and other evidence. They lit a fire, burning the clothes of the couple, except for the man&apos;s Hush Puppies shoes, which they kept. The six then went back to the Singh brothers&apos; home, where the juvenile made tea. Ram Singh divided up the results of the night&apos;s robberies, distributing credit and bank cards, cash and mobiles, jewellery and the shoes. Gupta got a wristwatch and 1,000 rupees, the juvenile was given 1,100 rupees and a bank card. &quot;Keep it carefully,&quot; Ram Singh told him. &quot;We&apos;ll take out the money later.&quot; There was a brief argument, overheard by neighbours. The two men, Gupta and Sharma, who lived elsewhere in the colony, went back to their houses. The others watched television and then slept, investigators say. Mahipalpur Mahipalpur is, like Dwarka, Trilokpuri and Ravi Das Colony itself, another place of transition, another scrawled note on the margin of the story of India&apos;s growth. Supposedly in Delhi&apos;s &quot;green belt&quot;, it had once been where sultans had hunted. Only a few decades ago it was still a small village, surrounded by scrubby, rocky hills and small pools of water where buffaloes bathed in the summer, submerged up to their necks to fight the heat. Now it is a noisy crossroads where the road to Delhi&apos;s airport joins a six-lane highway leading to the satellite city of Gurgaon, favoured by big international companies. Scores of unlicensed cheap hotels and restaurants cater to the passing trade of late-night arrivals from overseas, commuters heading in or out of the metropolis, lorry drivers and well-off teenagers driving their fathers&apos; fast cars looking for a plate of chilli chicken at 5am. For 40 minutes after their attackers had driven away, J and her friend lay, drifting in and out of consciousness, on a narrow strip of wasteland beside a slip road of the highway. A few hundred metres away, across open ground, the sign of a French-owned budget hotel under construction shone in the darkness. On the other side of the road, beyond the flyover, was a row of hotels. Lying in the gravel, bleeding heavily, they were nonetheless visible to the traffic streaming past. Vehicles slowed, almost stopped and then accelerated away, Pandey later remembered. Eventually, as ever in India, a small crowd gathered, though no one wanted to take responsibility for actually helping the naked and injured couple lying on the ground. Finally, according to police documents, an off-duty worker on the nearby toll highway saw the bystanders, stopped, and alerted his control room, which notified the police. A constable arrived in a patrol car, then another. One fetched a sheet from a nearby hotel to cover the couple. There was a brief discussion over which police district was responsible for dealing with the situation. Then Pandey helped J into a police car and was driven away.

Photograph: Daniel Berehulak/Getty    An hour later, a policeman called J&apos;s father to tell him his daughter had been in an &quot;accident&quot; and was in a hospital in south Delhi. A friend with a motorbike took him across the city to Safdarjung hospital, one of Delhi&apos;s biggest public medical facilities. He found her lying on a stretcher, covered by a green blanket. &quot;I thought she was unconscious but when I laid my hand on her forehead she opened her eyes. She was crying. I told her: &apos;It&apos;ll be alright, beta [child].&apos;&quot; Doctors had been appalled at extent of the woman&apos;s injuries. They attempted to remove the most damaged parts of her intestines and any infection, cleaning as much as possible of what was left and doing whatever else they could to keep her alive. But there was little hope, they all knew. One found her father, who had been waiting outside the operating theatre, and told him that it was unlikely his daughter would survive more than a few hours. Through the morning, police worked at tracing the white bus that Pandey, badly hurt but still conscious, had been able to describe to them. They started checking CCTV footage from the hotels clustered around Mahipalpur. One noticed a bus with the name Yadav painted on the side, which passed the crossroads twice an hour before the couple had been reported. They found its owner, who had bribed local officials after being repeatedly caught running unlicensed fleets, and got an address for Ram Singh. At Ravi Das Colony they first saw the bus, then Singh sitting inside. He ran but was caught. His T-shirt and shoes were bloodstained. The bus had clearly been washed recently. Very quickly, Singh admitted his involvement in the attack, even producing two iron rods, covered in dry blood, from a compartment in the bus&apos;s cabin. By the end of the week, five of the six were in custody. Mukesh Singh had been detained on his way to Karauli, where he hoped he could hide in the remote village where he had grown up. Gupta and Sharma were found at their family homes in Ravi Das Colony. Raju was picked up at the bus station where he slept. Thakur was found when he arrived at his parents&apos; home in remote Bihar. By then, news of the incident was not just leading every bulletin in the city, but across India. It had long been known that Delhi had a problem with sexual violence. Statistics backed up anecdotal evidence. For years, every few days, the media reported a serious sexual assault, though usually tucked away on the metro pages and recounted in a few dry paragraphs. Every few weeks there would be an attack, often a gang-rape. Some would receive more attention. But after the expressions of concern by police officers and Delhi&apos;s elected officials the issue would soon disappear. Few of the incidents ended in charges, almost none in a trial. The conviction rate for rapes languished around the 25% mark. According to India&apos;s National Crime Records Bureau, registered rape cases in India had increased by almost 900% over the past 40 years, to 24,206 incidents in 2011, while murder cases had gone up by only 250% over 60 years, and incidences of riot had actually dropped. Delhi, with its population of 15 million, registered 572 cases of rape, compared with 239 in Mumbai, India&apos;s commercial capital, with its bigger population, in 2011. There were just 47 reported in Kolkata. But no one knows quite what proportion of attacks these figures represent. Some activists say one in 10 rapes are reported; others say it is probably more like one in 100. One poll, in 2011, found that nearly one in four Indian men admitted to having committed some act of sexual violence. Two-thirds of the sample came from the capital. Then there is the daily low-level harassment in public places, simply accepted as part of life in the city. Suggestive comments and wandering hands on buses, photographing or filming with phones, being followed or even chased were, polls showed, regularly encountered by 80% of women in the city. According to one survey, this molestation \u2013 euphemistically known as &quot;Eve-teasing&quot; \u2013 was seen as harmless by a majority of men in Delhi. An investigation by Tehelka, a campaigning magazine, found that the policemen supposed to investigate &quot;Eve-teasing&quot; and rape alike blamed women for &quot;leading men on&quot;. A high proportion of Delhi&apos;s police are recruited from the surrounding rural areas and the big, poor conservative states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana and Rajasthan. Their attitudes inevitably reflect those of their home communities. These are very similar to Karauli, Aurangabad, Trilokpuri and the other places where J&apos;s attackers had grown up or spent many years. Only two months before the Delhi attack, a spate of rapes and gang-rapes in Haryana prompted some debate in the media. Local politicians attributed the wave of attacks to women behaving immodestly or the amount of junk food young men were eating. One called for the age of marital consent to be lowered. The United Nations pointed out that this would do little to counteract the rape of teenagers. These states are also the parts of India where gender imbalance owing to selective abortion is worst. Violence to women starts before birth, campaigners often say. But J&apos;s case was exceptional, standing out from the mundane background hum of sexual violence in northern India. The attack was of almost unprecedented brutality, committed by complete strangers on a Sunday evening, on the streets of Delhi itself. J was out with a friend watching a film. She was not in a village, nor was she working in a nightclub. She was thus seen as representative in a way that other victims, rightly or wrongly, had never been. Very soon she had been dubbed &quot;Delhi&apos;s daughter&quot; in the media, and thus neatly slotted into one of the three legitimate categories allowed to women in India: mother, spouse or child. Within hours of the news of the assault breaking, protesters were on the streets. The reaction of India&apos;s political elite merely fuelled the anger. No parliamentarians joined the marchers. Instead, the government invoked colonial-era laws to ban demonstrations, shut metro stations and deployed thousands of policemen to guard the president&apos;s residence, the parliament building and the homes of senior ministers. Central Delhi became a citadel, defended by khaki-clad men with lathis, the iron-tipped bamboo staves also inherited, like the attitudes of the ministers and top bureaucrats, from former imperial overlords. Finally, after a week, the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and Sonia Gandhi, president of the ruling Congress party, made brief televised speeches expressing concern and sympathy, which were dismissed as too little, too late by protesters. The anger grew. On 25 December, having held on to consciousness for long enough to twice give a crucial statement to investigators, J, still in Safdarjung hospital in the south of Delhi, began to lose her grip on life. Her father, Badri Nath, said: &quot;During the evening, maybe 9pm, she saw me standing outside the intensive-care unit. She turned to look at me and gestured for me to come. She asked me if I had eaten. I said yes. Then she said: &apos;Dad, go to sleep, you must be tired.&apos; I patted her head. She said: &apos;You should get some sleep,&apos;&quot; he remembered. &quot;She took my hand and kissed it. She never opened her eyes again.&quot; Four days later, J died in a clinic in Singapore, where she had been moved as no facilities for treatment that would even give her a chance of life existed in India. Her body was brought back to India, cremated in a public facility in Dwarka and then, as is traditional, her ashes were carried by her family to the banks of the Ganges, near the village that Badri Nath had left 30 years before, and scattered on the river. The night of her death the angry protests that had been beaten back by riot police in central Delhi and the marches in other cities demanding security for women in India gave way to demonstrations of a different type. There was grief, even shame. At 7pm, candles were lit across the vast country: on Juhu Beach, where Mumbai meets the Indian Ocean; in the centre of the bustling southern cities of Hyderabad and Bengaluru; at the statue of Gandhi in chaotic, poverty-stricken Lucknow, 1,000 miles to the north. In Delhi itself, though a city full of temples, mosques and churches, scores gathered at an impromptu shrine set up at the bus stop where J had waited for a lift home 13 days before. Under the hastily printed posters reading &quot;You Inspired Us All&quot; and &quot;No to Violence to Women&quot;, they too lit their candles. &quot;We are feeling very sad. We are feeling very angry. Now we hope our lives will change,&quot; said Archana Balodi, a 24-year-old student. One poster read: &quot;She is not dead, she has just gone to a place where there is no rape.&quot; At the Jantar Mantar, an 18th-century observatory that is a traditional site of protests in the centre of the city, crowds gathered. J&apos;s death meant her attackers would now be charged with murder, and thus could face hanging. This became the cry that united the otherwise diverse and disorganised demonstrators. &quot;Hanging them is not enough. They should be tortured like she was,&quot; said Srishdi Kumar, a 16-year-old schoolgirl. &quot;Then maybe there will be a change. Why not?&quot; Eight months later, at the conclusion of the trial of her killers, it is difficult to argue that J&apos;s ordeal and death has made much difference in India, at least so far: the rapes and sexual assaults that are now highlighted daily by the Indian media act simply as a reminder of how widespread violence to women is in the country. The fierce debate in the weeks after the attack \u2013 setting conservatives who blamed westernisation against liberals blaming reactionary sexist and patriarchal attitudes \u2013 has faded. A package of laws increasing punishments for sexual assault and redefining a range of offences may do some good, campaigners concede, if enforcement is simultaneously improved, but dozens of men accused of rape remain members of local and national parliamentary assemblies. The special funding released by the government for measures to enhance the security of women has so far gone unspent. Few are confident that gender training for the underfunded police will have much effect. Nor are the new &quot;fast-track courts&quot; \u2013 such as the one, only a few hundred metres from the mall where J and Pandey watched Life of Pi, where her attackers were tried \u2013 solve the problems of the criminal justice system. &quot;It is a few weeks of outrage against hundreds of years of tradition,&quot; MJ Akbar, a veteran commentator, said. But this may not be so. The concern is that it is the change itself that is generating the violence. The trial has now ended. Ram Singh, the ringleader in the attack, hanged himself in his cell in Tihar prison in mid-March. J&apos;s family angrily cried that they had been denied justice. &quot;It is wrong that he should be able to choose the timing of his death,&quot; said her brother. The other four adults who have been convicted are likely to be hanged after all appeals are exhausted. No one is quite clear what will happen to Raju, the juvenile, though he may have to be released after three years&apos; time in a juvenile reform home. Badri Nath, his wife and two sons have now moved to a new flat with running water, electricity and two bedrooms, a gift from the Delhi authorities. The family has also received &quot;compensation payments&quot;, in the cold language of the bureaucrats, worth \u00a340,000: more than Badri Nath could have ever hoped to have earned, let alone saved, in his working life. His sons are getting coveted government jobs. In a recent interview with the Guardian, he repeated one phrase: &quot;I console myself by saying she was a good soul, set free in death.&quot;  Outside in the narrow street, a tanker had just arrived to deliver water. Dwarka&apos;s piped supply is still unreliable. A crowd had formed and neighbours argued as they jostled with buckets. A woman laughed. A motorbike clattered past. A vegetable seller shouted for custom. There was a short burst of music from a tinny radio. But the noise of an evening in a working-class Delhi neighbourhood barely reached the small basement flat where a 53-year-old man sat on his daughter&apos;s bed, and it was very quiet \u2022 This article was amended on 16 September 2013.

The Bank said the wipe-clean polymer notes will be less tatty, tougher to counterfeit and last up to six times longer than cotton-paper based notes. They will also be 15% smaller, bringing English notes into line with sizes in other countries, but will remain larger than existing euro notes. The public will have the chance to look at and feel the new notes at shopping centres across the country in a consultation process that starts immediately, with the new governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, taking a final decision on the go-ahead in December. The Sir Winston Churchill \u00a35 note will be the first to be made in polymer and launched in 2016, with the Jane Austen \u00a310 note following in 2017. All the notes will continue to feature the Queen and use existing colours. Plastic notes have been in circulation in Australia for more than two decades and are being rolled out in Canada, Carney&apos;s home country, but the Bank said its polymer project began long before the new governor was appointed. Scotland and Northern Ireland, where seven banks have the right to issue notes, will be free to continue with paper notes, opening up the possibility that cash machines in Carlisle will issue in plastic but across the border in Gretna will continue to supply in paper. The Bank of England said that in tests, the new plastic notes do not melt until at least 120C and survive washing machines much better than existing paper notes. Despite being made from polymer pellets, the Bank said the notes will be more environmentally friendly as the manufacturing process does not use the same intensity of water as cotton-paper manufacture. The new notes will cost around 50% more to produce, but the Bank estimates it will save \u00a3100m as it will need to replace the notes far less frequently. But the Bank ruled out importing plastic money from China. The notes will continue to be produced at the Bank&apos;s ultra-secure plant in Debden, Essex, although subcontracted to a private company, likely to be either De La Rue, the existing maker, or Innovia, which manufactures most of the polymer notes currently in circulation across the world. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charles Bean, said there was no question that the introduction of plastic notes was a &quot;done deal&quot; and promised to listen to feedback from the public before going ahead. &quot;Polymer banknotes are cleaner, more secure and more durable than paper notes. They are also cheaper and more environmentally friendly. &quot;However, the Bank of England would print notes on polymer only if we were persuaded that the public would continue to have confidence in, and be comfortable with, our notes. The results of the consultation programme on which we are embarking will therefore form a vital part of our assessment of the merits of polymer banknotes.&quot; In recognition of the need for groups such as the blind to handle the change, the Bank will continue to issue notes in size-ascending order, so the new fivers and tenners will continue to be slightly different in size. There is no switchover date yet proposed for when or if \u00a320 notes \u2013 the most common note in circulation \u2013 will be changed to polymer. In Canada, where high-value notes are already made of polymer and lower-denomination notes will be introduced later this year, there have been some complaints that the notes tend to stick to each other. But the Bank of England said it did not expect this to be an issue, although it did accept that brand new notes will have a more slippery texture than cotton-paper ones. The extended time scale for the introduction of the notes has been put in place to allow the cash handling industry, retailers and ATM and vending machine operators time to mange the transition. ATMs will be able to hold, say paper \u00a320 notes and plastic \u00a310 notes, but will not able to issue plastic \u00a310 notes alongside paper \u00a310 notes as they will be different sizes. But because the polymer notes will be thinner, cash machines will be able to stock more, and operators say the machines will be less likely to jam. But it is security and counterfeiting that the Bank of England places at the heart of the new notes. Evidence from Australia and other countries such as New Zealand, Singapore, Mexico and Nigeria, where polymer notes are common, is that after their introduction counterfeiting reduced substantially. Last year the Bank of England removed 719,000 counterfeit notes from circulation, a relatively high rate compared with other countries. Shoppers in Northern Ireland will already be familiar with polymer notes, since a limited-edition note was circulated in 2000 by Northern Bank to mark the millennium. If the new notes go ahead, removal of paper notes is expected to be relatively swift, taking no more than eight months."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/10/delhi-gang-rape-death-sentence-inevitable", "sentences": ["The victim and her friend were eventually dumped on a roadside layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-10T13:59:41Z", "title": "Delhi gang-rape trial: death sentence inevitable, says Indian minister", "tags": ["India", "World news"], "article": "An Indian government minister has said four men found guilty on Tuesday of the gang-rape and murder of a woman in Delhi last year will be hanged.

They have been found guilty of gang rape, unnatural offences, destruction of evidence \u2026 and for committing the murder of the helpless victim,&quot; Khanna said. Akshay Kumar Singh, a bus cleaner; Vinay Sharma, a gym instructor; Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller; and Mukesh Singh, who was unemployed, will be sentenced on Wednesday. Most observers say a death sentence is very likely, though life imprisonment remains a theoretical possibility. Lawyers for the four men said they would appeal and branded the verdict &quot;politically motivated&quot;. Public opinion in India appears almost unanimously in favour of a death sentence. One TV channel ran a headline asking: &quot;They&apos;ve been convicted, but will they hang?&quot; The mother of the 23-year-old victim, who cannot be identified under Indian law, sat just a few feet from the four men who stood against a wall in the court as the verdict was read out. She and her husband have repeatedly called for the men, who attacked their daughter on a bus after she had watched a film at a south Delhi cinema, to be put to death. Outside the courthouse, dozens of protesters chanted: &quot;Hang them! Hang them! &quot; India has executed three people in the last nine years: a man who raped a 14-year-old girl, and two Islamic militants. The trial of the men, aged between 19 and 34, started in February, two months after the attack. One defendant, a bus driver, hanged himself in prison in March. The oldest of the six accused, he was alleged by police to have been the ringleader. The youngest among the alleged attackers, who was 17 at the time of the assault, was tried separately and was sentenced last month to three years in a juvenile reform home, the maximum possible punishment under Indian law. The ruling Congress party was heavily criticised after the incident last December for its slow and insensitive response. Sheila Dikshit, a Congress leader and chief minister of Delhi, called the incident a wake-up call that was &quot;very shocking and very painful and shook up everyone of us, in Delhi and the entire country&quot;. Ambika Soni, a senior Congress parliamentarian, said the punishment should be &quot;exemplary&quot;. Opposition politicians also said they wanted to see the severest possible punishment for the rapists. The attack prompted an unprecedented national discussion about sexual violence and calls for widespread changes in cultural attitudes and policing, as well as legal reform. The international image of the country was damaged, with numbers of female tourists dropping significantly. Since the attack, laws have been tightened and pledges made to improve the investigation and processing of sexual violence cases. Vrinda Grover, a well-known activist, said the challenge was to make any changes institutional. &quot;There is certainly much higher awareness now \u2026 but the Indian system has huge inertia,&quot; she said. Much of the trial was held behind closed doors, with media excluded for many months. The court heard details of how the victim, who had recently qualified as a physiotherapist, had suffered severe internal injuries when repeatedly violated with an iron bar during the assault. The victim&apos;s father told the Guardian last week that the family had been disappointed by the three-year sentence given to the juvenile convicted last month. Police have said the teenager was the most violent of the attackers. All of the men on trial in Saket denied charges of rape, murder and destroying evidence. Two said they had been to listen to a music concert in a park on the night of the attack. One said he was driving the bus in which the assault took place and did not take therefore directly take part in the assault. A fourth, a 26-year-old drifter, said he had left Delhi for his village. The prosecution case relied on testimony from 85 witnesses, a statement given by the victim before she died, DNA samples, dental records from bite marks on the victim&apos;s body that matched the teeth of some of the men, and the evidence of the victim&apos;s male friend, who was badly beaten in the attack. The victim and her friend were eventually dumped on a roadside layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. Her ashes were eventually scattered in the Ganges river near her ancestral village in rural India. The men were also found guilty of robbing another man earlier in the evening of the incident. Police described how the six had set out from the Singh brothers&apos; home in a bus on a joyride. They tricked the victim and her friend into boarding the bus and assaulted them shortly afterwards. There has been widespread criticism of the fast-track court set up to ensure rapid justice in the case, which was one of the most high-profile in India for years. Gang-rapes, acid attacks and other acts of violence against women continue to be reported across India each day. In one recent incident a photojournalist was raped repeatedly by a group of men in a disused building in Mumbai, the commercial capital. Suspects have since been arrested. The victim of the attack was widely praised for her courage in complaining to police and identifying her attackers. Rape victims in India often prefer to remain silent rather than risk social ostracism, and sexual harassment remains a daily reality for Indian women. &quot;Every day I take trains, buses and rickshaws and every day I get harassed one way or another. Last week it was a boy of only nine years old. We have to stand up to them. No one will take the first step unless you take it yourself,&quot; said Shurbhi Sharma, a 19-year-old student in Mumbai. It is hoped that fast-track courts such as the one in which this trial was held will help improve a poor conviction rate. Last week six men accused of the gang-rape of a law student in October last year were sentenced to life imprisonment by a fast-track court in the southern city of Bangalore. Many families of victims pressure them not to press charges, police often refuse to file cases for those who do, witnesses are systematically intimidated and courts rarely deliver swift justice in the few cases that are filed. Indian courts had a backlog of 33m cases as of 2011. In this case, an appeal can first be made to Delhi&apos;s high court and then, if that fails, to the Indian supreme court, legal experts say. Each appeal could take up to a year. India has executed more than 50 people since gaining independence in 1947 and has repeatedly voted against United Nations resolutions seeking a global moratorium on capital punishment. The Indian president has the power to pardon or commute sentences. Three men have been hanged in the last nine years, including Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the only survivor of the extremists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai in 2008, who was hanged last year, and Afzal Guru, found guilty for his role in the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament in 2001, who was hanged in February this year. The third was found guilty of the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl. Last year a 22-year-old man was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a 75-year-old woman."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/11/the-knowledge-questions-answered", "sentences": ["And Hairul Sukaim in Singapore points out that Geylang&apos;s S-League clash with Home United this year saw their English midfielder John Wilkinson score a hat-trick from the spot."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-11T09:41:54Z", "title": "The Knowledge: Players returning to former clubs | Jacob Steinberg", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "&quot;With Kak\u00e1 coming back to Milan after four years, it made me wonder what is the soonest after a transfer a club has shown deep transfer regret and bid to bring the same player back?&quot; asks Paolo Cabrelli in last week&apos;s thrilling edition of The Knowledge. Well, Mark Hughes was busy congratulating himself recently for deciding to go back on his decision to release Jermaine Pennant after the winger scored a brilliant free-kick for Stoke City to earn them a 1-0 win over West Ham. Pennant, who spent part of last season on loan at Wolves, was released by Stoke when his contract expired on 6 June but 12 days later he was back again after Hughes decided he needed him after all. Leon Britton also left Swansea for Sheffield United in 2010, only to return a year later. Paolo&apos;s question also led to plenty of responses from our readers. &quot;Cambridge United sold Steve Claridge to Luton in 1992, only to buy him back again four months later!&quot; says Nick Orton. &quot;A recent example in the Premier League is Spurs buying Robbie Keane back from Liverpool, a mere six months after selling him to them.&quot; Sticking on the Mark Hughes theme, James Straughan writes: &quot;My original thought around this was that it would be Mark Hughes, who Man United signed back two years after we sold him to Barcelona. Then I remembered Christopher Samba, who rejoined Anzhi Makhachkala (in this very window) a mere 5 months after leaving them for QPR. The regret was clearly short-lived, he played a mere five games before being sold again, this time to Dynamo Moscow.&quot; Matthew Thomber writes: &quot;Surely it has to be Ian Rush, he was away for less than nine months and only played 29 games for The Old Lady. Not only that, Liverpool made \u00a3500,000 on the deal.&quot; And Pete Moxon writes: &quot;There is a player who returned to a club quicker than Kak\u00e1, and what&apos;s more, he did it twice. In 1985 Gordon Cowans was transferred from Aston Villa to Bari, and returned to Villa Park three years later. He then moved to Blackburn Rovers in 1991 but then, as if attached by a strong piece of elastic, bounced back to Villa Park a year-and-a-half later. He subsequently had short spells at half a dozen other clubs before retiring and returning once more to the place where he belongs in 1998 as a coach, and is still working at Villa today, 39 years after he first arrived as an apprentice.&quot; HITTING THE GROUND RUNNING &quot;Who was the last player to score on his first two England appearances a la Rickie Lambert?&quot; asks Norman Gough. Rickie Lambert is the first player to score on his first two England appearances since Peter Taylor in 1976. Taylor got both his against Wales; he never scored again and made the last of his four England appearances seven days after scoring that second goal. Taylor&apos;s first goal came in a 2-1 win over Wales in Wrexham. He scored England&apos;s winner in the 80th minute. Taylor then scored the only goal when the two sides met at Cardiff in the Home Internationals on 8 May 1976 but although he played in England&apos;s 4-0 win over Northern Ireland three days later, his last appearance came in a 2-1 defeat against Scotland on 15 May 1976 at Hampden Park. SHARPSHOOTERS &quot;I was looking through the goalscoring records of a few international players and I noticed that 45 of Samuel Eto&apos;o&apos;s 55 international goals came in competitive games,&quot; says Peter McKenna. &quot;Are there any other international players with a higher competitive goalscoring ratio?&quot; Yes. Preben Elkjaer, Karim Bagheri and Ali Daei. Elkjaer scored 38 goals for Denmark and 32 of those came in competitive games, meaning 84% of his goals came in competitive games, Bagheri scored 47 in 50 for Algeria (94%) and Ali Daei had 96 in 109 (88%) for Iran. Eto&apos;o is at 82%. Knowledge archive &quot;Charlie Mitten once scored three penalties in a game for Manchester United against Aston Villa in 1950,&quot; wrote Dennis Jones in December 2005. Has anyone else ever managed this unusual hat-trick?&quot; As several of you pointed out, Ronaldo is the highest-profile player to have matched Mitten&apos;s achievement. In June last year, during Brazil&apos;s 3-1 World Cup qualifying win against Argentina, the chubby striker not only won all three spot-kicks (fouled by Gabriel Heinze, Javier Mascherano, and then the goalkeeper Pablo Cavallero), but got straight back up to beat Cavallero each time. He actually took four successful penalties in the game, but his opening effort was disallowed after a team-mate encroached. Next up is Andy Blair, who scored three from the spot for Sheffield Wednesday in their 4-2 Milk Cup win over Luton in November 1984. &quot;He was the first player to score a hat-trick of penalties in the League Cup, no less,&quot; says Peter Gethin. His efforts were followed by both Liverpool&apos;s Jan Molby (against Coventry in November 1986) and the Blackburn midfielder David Dunn (against Rochdale in September 2000). Meanwhile the 2004 FA Vase quarter-final between Bideford AFC and Gosport County also saw Bideford&apos;s Mike Southgate bag a treble from the spot. Looking further back, Adam Purdue recalls that &quot;Ken Barnes scored three penalties for Manchester City in the 6-2 home win over Everton in December 1957&quot; while, according to the Evening Telegraph, a host of Scottish players have matched the feat: Bobby Collins, Celtic v Aberdeen (1950); Eddie Turnbull, Hibernian v Celtic (1951); Billy Price, Falkirk v Hamilton (1959); Gordon Wallace, Montrose v Hamilton (1963); Willie Johnston, Rangers v St Johnstone (1971); Donald Ford, Hearts v Morton (1973); Bobby McKean, St Mirren v Brechin (1974); Gerry Colgan, Queen&apos;s Park v Brechin (1976). There&apos;s more. Bogdan Kotarlic recalls that Gordan Petric, formerly of Dundee United, Rangers, Crystal Palace and Hearts, scored three penalties for OFK Belgrade in the then-Yugoslavian second division, back in the late 1980s. Simon Elam remembers a Serie A game in the mid-90s where Giuseppe Giannini scored three penalties for Roma. And Hairul Sukaim in Singapore points out that Geylang&apos;s S-League clash with Home United this year saw their English midfielder John Wilkinson score a hat-trick from the spot. As the report of their remarkable 4-4 draw explains, Wilkinson grabbed all four of his team&apos;s goals. Paraguay&apos;s Jose Luis Chilavert became the first goalkeeper to score three penalties during Velez Sarsfield&apos;s 6-1 victory over Ferro Carril Oeste in November 1999. The Cruzeiro striker Alex (now of Fenerbahce) can lay claim to an even more spectacular record: during the final-round Brazilian Championship clash at Bahia in December 2003 he scored four times from the spot \u2013 all in the first 37 minutes. Before we leave the subject, though, special mention must go to Argentinian striker Mart\u00edn Palermo, who is in the Guinness Book Of Records for missing the most penalties in a game. In July 1999, during the 3-0 Copa America defeat against Colombia, Palermo conspired to miss three spot-kicks. No wonder the Colombian coach Javier Alvarez could not believe his luck. &quot;There&apos;s always a first time for everything \u2013 and today I saw it,&quot; he said, stifling a chuckle. The efforts of &apos;El Loco&apos;, as he is known, helped lower Boca Juniors&apos; (his club side) share price by 4.5% overnight, before he secured a move to Spain. Can you help? &quot;With an English manager not having won the top flight for more than 20 years, are there any other leagues that have not been won by a manager from the same country?&quot; says Hywel Benbow. &quot;England v Ukraine&apos;s World Cup Qualifier was staged at Kiev&apos;s Olympic Stadium, a ground which has played host to &apos;some football matches at the 1980 summer Olympics&apos; according to noted sage Wikipedia. What is the least number of Olympic football matches ever to be staged at a football ground with the temerity to call itself the Olympics Stadium?&quot; asks Matt Byron. &quot;I see San Marino currently have a goal difference of -42 in World Cup qualifying Group H. What is the worst goal difference ever recorded in a World Cup qualifying campaign?&quot; ponders Lee Smith."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/delhi-rape-trial-defence-gandhi-death-penalty", "sentences": ["The victims were eventually dumped at a layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-11T10:50:06Z", "title": "Delhi rape trial: defence cites Gandhi in plea against death penalty", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Capital punishment", "Rape and sexual assault", "Law", "Society"], "article": "Defence lawyers cited the teachings of Gandhi as they fought to save four men convicted for their role in the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapist in Delhi from execution.

They had denied the charges against them and their lawyers have said they will appeal the verdict. AP Singh, representing Sharma and Thakur, spoke of what he said was the belief of the Mahatma Gandhi, the independence leader and pioneer of nonviolent political protest, that &quot;God gives life and he alone can take it and not manmade courts&quot;. The four men will be sentenced on Friday, a judge in the Indian capital said on Wednesday. India has repeatedly voted against UN resolutions for a moratorium on capital punishment though it carries out only infrequent executions. Three men have been hanged in the last nine years \u2013 a rapist and murderer, and two Islamic militants convicted of terrorism offences. Police officials told the Guardian that the four convicted men sang Bollywood musical songs while being driven from Tihar prison to the court on Wednesday. &quot;They were totally relaxed [this morning]. Mukesh sat in front, the rest behind and they were humming songs,&quot; said one police official, who accompanied the men. One of the four shouted: &quot;I am innocent! I am innocent! I am innocent,&quot; at reporters as the bus passed the gates of the district court of Saket in south Delhi where the seven-month trial had been held. Judge Yogesh Khanna heard arguments for and against the death sentence during Wednesday&apos;s session. Prosecutors have insisted that the case qualifies as &quot;the rarest of the rare&quot; which justifies the severest punishment. The judge, however, can order life imprisonment. AP Singh, representing 19-year-old Sharma, reminded the court of his client&apos;s youth, while Thakur&apos;s lawyer argued that\u00a0the 26-year-old had a young son and ill parents. Prosecution lawyers stressed what they said was a premeditated attack to murder the victim and a male friend by running them over after they were dumped, apparently unconscious, from the bus in which they had been assaulted. The family of the victim, who died from massive internal injuries caused when she was penetrated with an iron rod in the attack, have called for the death sentence. Sushilkumar Shinde, India&apos;s home minister, told reporters in Mumbai on Tuesday that a death sentence was &quot;assured&quot;. The comments, which came after the verdict but before sentencing, were unusual and an indication of the Indian government&apos;s concern about public anger over the incident. The public appears overwhelmingly in favour of execution of the men. But Colin Gonsalves, a prominent human rights campaigner, said the men should receive life sentences, not death. &quot;Popular sentiment is guided by people at the top and those at the top are very bloodthirsty kind of people. You can see the spread of hatred and violence in this country,&quot; he told the Guardian. The trial of five of the attackers started in February. One defendant, a bus driver, hanged himself in prison in March. The oldest of the six accused of the attack on the physiotherapy student was alleged by police to have been the ringleader. The youngest, who was 17 at the time of the assault, was tried separately and was last month sentenced to three years in a juvenile reform home \u2013 the maximum punishment of a minor under Indian law. The attack provoked outrage in India with protests across the country. It also led to an unprecedented national discussion about sexual violence and calls for widespread changes in cultural attitudes and policing, and legal reform. The international image of the country was damaged, with numbers of female tourists dropping significantly. Relatives of the convicted men have spoken out against the verdict. &quot;If he would have been a politician&apos;s son this would not have happened with him,&quot; Vinay Sharma&apos;s mother told reporters. The prosecution case relied on testimony from 85 witnesses, a statement given by the victim before she died, DNA samples, dental records from bite marks on her body that matched the teeth of some of the men and the evidence of her male friend, who was also badly beaten in the attack. He described how the couple were attacked after boarding the bus on the way home from an evening film at an upscale shopping centre. The victims were eventually dumped at a layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. Her ashes were later scattered in the Ganges river, near her ancestral village in rural India. The accused men were also found guilty of robbing another man earlier in the evening of the incident. Police described how the six had set out from the Singh brothers&apos; home in a bus on a &quot;joy ride&quot;. They then tricked the victim and her friend into boarding the vehicle and assaulted them shortly afterwards. Laws on sexual assault and harassment were tightened in the aftermath of the incident, but serious institutional reforms will take much longer, women&apos;s rights campaigners say. Police in Delhi believe a rise in rape reports is partly owing to an increased willingness by victims to come forward. There were 1,036 cases of rape reported in the capital in year to 15 August, compared with 433 in the same period last year, according to police data.

The forestry minister, Zulkifi Hasan, said he was left shocked by Ford&apos;s emotionally charged interview techniques and complained there was no time to go over the questions before filming began, local media reported. &quot;I suddenly had my face made up and was then interviewed,&quot; Hasan told the state news agency Antara. &quot;I was given a chance to make only one or two comments.&quot; The Star Wars actor has been in Indonesia filming an episode for the climate change documentary series Years of Living Dangerously, which will air on the US television network Showtime in April 2014 and feature Matt Damon and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ford, 71, travelled to locations around the country to interview Indonesian activists and officials, including the president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, on issues including forest fires, peatland conservation and palm oil plantations. But the forestry minister was so angered by his interview with Ford that he threatened to have the actor deported, despite the fact that Ford was due to leave on Tuesday anyway. &quot;There&apos;s no privilege for him although he is a great actor,&quot; the presidential spokesman Andi Arief said. &quot;His crew and those who were helping him in Indonesia must be questioned to find out their motives for harassing a state institution.&quot; He added: &quot;If necessary, we will deport him.&quot; Ford appears to have witnessed illegal logging taking place in Sumatra&apos;s Tesso Nilo national park and asked Hasan why deforestation was occurring in protected areas while the guilty seemingly had free rein. &quot;He was emotional,&quot; Hasan said. &quot;I can understand that this is the first time for this American to come here and see Tesso Nilo. It seems that what he wants to see is any perpetrators involved in the damage immediately arrested.&quot; The minister said he told Ford that illegal logging was a complicated issue in Indonesia and required a more varied approach to stem it than simple force. Up to 15% of all the world&apos;s known plant, mammal and bird species reside in Indonesia&apos;s 17,000 islands, according to Greenpeace. Yet huge swaths of Indonesia&apos;s rainforests and peatlands have been cleared for palm oil and paper plantations, with additional concessions granted for mining and agricultural purposes. Palm oil concessions sprawl across some 11m hectares in Indonesia, primarily in Sumatra and Kalimantan, figures from the US Foreign Agricultural Service show, with production since 2011 up 26% from the previous 10 years. Yudhoyono, Indonesia&apos;s president, was forced to apologise earlier this year after forest fires, set by plantation farmers in Sumatra to clear land, led to Singapore&apos;s worst environmental crisis in 10 years and forced 200 schools to close in Malaysia. Officials maintain, however, that the government is doing what it can to tackle climate change and deforestation, and Yudhoyono reportedly told Ford in their meeting on Tuesday: &quot;We&apos;re trying to crack down on improprieties [like illegal logging] and we will be strict about it.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/cities-bypass-government-climate-change", "sentences": ["Sinagore transport Photograph: Land Transport Authority of Singapore    Meanwhile, Singapore&apos;s Intelligent Transport System, which incorporates a range of smart transportation technologies and allow the city state to enjoy one of the lowest congestion rates of a city its size anywhere in the world, was awarded the Intelligent Infrastructure Prize."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-12T12:09:00Z", "title": "Cities bypass slow government to lead the way on climate change", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Scaling up", "Climate change", "Cities"], "article": "Efforts by national governments to tackle climate change and other sustainability challenges have been mixed at best over the past 20 years, but there is one level of government that has embraced the challenge with gusto \u2013 and success. &quot;National governments have largely failed to act, while cities embody the spirit of innovation we need. When it comes to climate change, cities are where the most exciting progress is being made,&quot; said Michael Bloomberg, mayor of New York, speaking by videolink to the City Climate Leadership Awards in London this month. He added pointedly that, &quot;mayors do not have the luxury of just talking about problems. They have to deliver results.&quot; Partly, this is a matter of necessity \u2013 more than half the world&apos;s people live in cities, they consume two-thirds of the world&apos;s energy and generate 70% of carbon emissions. &quot;If we want to win the war against climate change, it has to be won in cities,&quot; said Roland Busch, head of Cities and Infrastructure at Siemens, sponsors of the awards. Many of the world&apos;s megacities are situated on the coast and their vulnerability to sea level rise and the effects of extreme weather events has been highlighted in recent years by disasters such as Superstorm Sandy, which devastated New York last year and Hurricane Katrina, which had a similar effect on New Orleans. But it&apos;s not just rising seas \u2013 each city has its own challenges, from the wildfires that threatened Melbourne in 2009 to the floods that deluged Bangkok in 2011, severely disrupting the entire Thai economy, to the choking smog that afflicts Beijing, New Delhi and Los Angeles. But equally, the world&apos;s urban areas are where the opportunities lie \u2013 they generate more than 70% of global GDP and cities are growing faster than other parts of the economy. &quot;If you want to provide infrastructure for people in the most cost-efficient and effective way, you do it in cities,&quot; said Busch. Perhaps the fact that people in urban environments are &quot;squished together&quot; makes them more accepting of the need to take action, said Matthew Pencharz, an adviser on energy and environment to London&apos;s mayor Boris Johnson. While national politicians&apos; pronouncements can sometimes seem too vague for people to get to grips with, &quot;mayors have found a way to take action that is accountable to the population and brings them visible, tangible benefits that improve their quality of life.&quot; Mayors have a lot of the right power, argues Rohit Aggarwala, special adviser to the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and former director of planning and sustainability in New York. &quot;The politics align well and, in addition, many of the interest groups that are most opposed to climate action are simply not as prominent in cities.&quot; The consultants McKinsey argue in a new report entitled How to make a city great, &quot;that leaders who make important strides in improving their cities do three things really well: They achieve smart growth. They do more with less. And they win support for change.&quot;     Bogota transport Photograph: Alcadia Mayor de Bogota    These improvements do not need to cost a lot of money if they are imaginative enough \u2013 McKinsey reports that the former mayor of Bogot\u00e1, Antanas Mockus, &quot;famously hired 420 mimes to make fun of traffic violators: this entertaining public ridicule reduced traffic fatalities by more than 50%.&quot; Robert Doyle, Lord Mayor of Melbourne, explained how his city has a plan to double the number of trees in the city by planting an extra 30,000 saplings, which he said would cut temperatures in the centre by 4\u00b0C, as well as making the city more liveable and sustainable. Other initiatives are more complex and all-encompassing \u2013 Tokyo won the finance and economic development prize at the awards for introducing the world&apos;s first city-based carbon trading programme, which since its introduction in 2010 has cut the Japanese capital&apos;s emissions by 7m tonnes by focusing on emissions from buildings.     Sinagore transport Photograph: Land Transport Authority of Singapore    Meanwhile, Singapore&apos;s Intelligent Transport System, which incorporates a range of smart transportation technologies and allow the city state to enjoy one of the lowest congestion rates of a city its size anywhere in the world, was awarded the Intelligent Infrastructure Prize. The old days, when the various aspects of city life were tackled separately, are gone, according to Busch. &quot;A city is like a human organism \u2013 everything has to work together. A comprehensive view of infrastructure, disregarding silos, is the key to the future development of cities.&quot; And while every city is different, they can learn a lot from each other about what works best \u2013 and they are prepared to do so, in a way that national governments do not seem to be. That is why Boris Johnson, opening the awards, said that whoever won the awards, &quot;you can be sure that we in London will shamelessly nick your ideas&quot;. One of the lessons cities have learned is the importance of measuring their impacts. &quot;If you know where to start, then you know where to go,&quot; said Busch. One example of this is the decidedly chilly city of Oslo in Norway, which discovered that along with heating in the winter, cooling buildings in summer was a significant source of emissions. &quot;We were surprised,&quot; said mayor Stian Berger R\u00f8sland, &quot;but it enabled us to look at using seawater for both heating and cooling.&quot; By refusing to wait for action from national governments and international bodies, cities are leading the way in addressing the risks posed by climate change, said Bloomberg. &quot;Using innovative local approaches, cities are having an impact on climate change globally.&quot; This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

According to Rose George, even the men who work on container ships don&apos;t show much interest in the boxes they transport: &quot;They think they are boring, opaque, blank. Stuff carrying stuff.&quot; But she finds that blankness &quot;entrancing&quot; and, in Deep Sea and Foreign Going, an account of a five-week trip from Felixstowe to Singapore, has penetrated a world noted for its secrecy \u2013 most container ports, heavily protected by barbed wire and security cameras, are segregated from the cities\u00a0in which they are found \u2013 to produce an ethnographic travelogue that is as fascinating as it is troublingly insightful. The cultural theorist Paul Virilio has\u00a0argued that &quot;we are moving from a\u00a0revolution in transport to one in loading&quot;. That&apos;s not exactly the kind of revolution that makes front-page news. Part of the challenge for anyone who writes about logistics and infrastructure is to show how a subject that appears remote impacts on the lives of the general public. George does this by the simple trick of opening her eyes: aboard an English train she looks at the headphones, uniforms and trolley food in front of her and explains that almost all of them have been brought here by ship. The reason is economics: shipping has become so cheap, she explains, that it&apos;s less costly for Scottish cod to be sent 10,000 miles to China to be filleted and then exported back to restaurants here than it is to pay the (already small) salaries of Scottish filleters. Deep Sea and Foreign Going is itself a\u00a0container ship of a book brimming with lots of equally startling facts: containers are the largest man-made moving objects on the planet; Triple-E class boats are around 400 metres in length and can carry 18,000 boxes; in 2011, 360 commercial ports in America took in international goods worth $1.73tn \u2013 80 times the total value of all US trade in 1960; even in the UK, whose sense of\u00a0itself as a seafaring nation has long waned, the shipping industry employs nearly 635,000 people; port authorities inspect less than 10% of boxes, making them of great interest to\u00a0counterfeiters and drug barons. The scale of these statistics was highlighted by Marc Levinson in his 2006 book The Box. What George, whose A Life Removed (2004) and The Big Necessity (2008) focused on equally transnational issues of refugeedom and\u00a0the politics of waste, brings to the existing literature is an attention to the human dimensions of the trade. Modern sailors are a motley, multinational bunch. People from India, Bangladesh, Ukraine and Russia are common. Most populous of all are Filipinos, who are lured not only by the wages (government officials back home earn \u00a3200 a month, while the sailors&apos; minimum pay is meant to be \u00a3354), but\u00a0by aggressive advertising that casts\u00a0mariners as patriotic heroes whose remittances \u2013 amounting to many billions of dollars annually \u2013 support the nation. Many work more than 85 hours a week and are given meagre provisions. It is not uncommon for them to be abandoned on ships for months without pay. George quotes a 17th-century clergyman who described seamen as neither living nor dead, but &quot;a third sort of persons&quot;. The captain of the ship on which she sails likens them to &quot;mere chattels&quot; and &quot;dispensable nonentities&quot;. Many of the ships, their conditions poorly monitored and regulated, are better described as floating coffins. Death is ever-present: 2,000 seafarers died at sea in 2006. One of the most upsetting chapters deals with the sinking of a livestock carrier and horrific scenes of people screaming, swallowing oil, clinging to the tails of heifers. Container ships, often assumed to be more environmentally sound than sending freight by road or air, are catastrophic in other ways too: collectively they produce more pollution than Germany; by 2008 the sewage they discharge had created more than 400 oceanic dead zones; in Los Angeles the sulphur dioxide they spew is responsible for half the city&apos;s smog; the level of\u00a0underwater noise they generate is rising by three decibels every decade and causing acoustic hell for fin and blue whales. It&apos;s rare for researchers to get access to container ships: owners often have a\u00a0lot to hide. George&apos;s Maersk shipping line-sponsored voyage is not conventionally eventful (she spends a lot of time playing backgammon with a terse third officer), but her arguments are action-packed. In an excellent chapter set in the Gulf of Aden she skewers (tacitly) historians such as Marcus Rediker, who represent pirates as radicals who subverted the values of\u00a0Atlantic capitalism and (explicitly) Harvard Business School, which, in 2010, selected Somali piracy as its business model. Some readers may want to hear more first-hand accounts from Asian workers on board the containers. Those who are theoretically inclined and eager to understand the relationship between containerisation and coastal &quot;exo-urbanism&quot; will turn first to Olivier Mongin&apos;s Villes Sous Pression. But this is still a remarkable work of embedded reportage \u2013 hair-raising, witty, compassionate \u2013 that deserves to be read alongside Allan Sekula&apos;s groundbreaking Fish Story (1996) and by anyone interested in the cartographies of the contemporary world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/delhi-gang-rape-men-sentenced-death", "sentences": ["The victims were eventually dumped on a roadside layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-13T09:06:35Z", "title": "Delhi gang-rape: four men sentenced to death", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Gender", "Women", "Life and style"], "article": "A judge in Delhi has sentenced to death four men convicted for their role in the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapist in the Indian capital last year. Bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh were convicted earlier this week of rape, unnatural sex, murder, conspiracy and destruction of evidence. They had denied the charges against them and their lawyers have said they will appeal against both the verdict and the sentence. The sentence was pronounced at 2.30pm by Yogesh Khanna, the judge who has heard the case over seven months at the district court of Saket in south Delhi. It will be automatically referred to a high court bench of two judges who will consider the sentence and the appeal that lawyers for the four men have said they will file. If upheld, an appeal to the supreme court is also possible. The Indian president can pardon offenders. Such a process would be likely to take several years. The parents of the victim, who died from massive internal injuries caused when she was penetrated with an iron rod in the attack in December, have repeatedly called for the men to be hanged. They were in court on Friday. Gaurav, the brother of the victim, said it had been hard to watch the accused men &quot;laughing&quot; during the trial and that the family were &quot;very happy&quot; with the sentencing. &quot;This is true justice for my sister,&quot; he told the Guardian. Officials said the four men had been calm when the sentence was announced. The father of the victim&apos;s male friend, who was with her during the attack and badly injured, said he welcomed the sentence. &quot;My respect for the Indian judiciary has gone up manifold. It was death they deserved and death they got,&quot; Bhanu Pratap Pandey said. Crowds outside the courthouse cheered when the verdict was announced. Gaurav said the family would campaign for a longer sentence for the juvenile convicted in a separate trial two weeks ago. VK Anand, a defence lawyer, said the trial had been fair but that &quot;mitigating circumstances&quot; should have been taken into account by the judge when sentencing. Prosecutors have insisted that the case qualifies as &quot;the rarest of the rare&quot; that justifies the severest punishment. They described it as a &quot;diabolic&quot; act of &quot;extreme brutality&quot; and stressed what they said was a premeditated plan to murder the victim and a male friend by running them over after they were dumped, apparently unconscious, from the bus in which they had been assaulted. AP Singh, representing 19-year-old Sharma, reminded the court of his client&apos;s youth and the effect of alcohol, while Thakur&apos;s lawyer argued that the 26-year-old drifter had a young son and an aged mother. There is little doubt that public opinion firmly favours hanging. Newspapers on Friday morning reported that there was a &quot;strong case for [the] death penalty&quot; and the country&apos;s usually argumentative televised debates have struggled to overcome unanimity of opinions on the issue. Colin Gonsalves, a prominent human rights campaigner, said the men should receive life sentences, not death. &quot;It has become a very violent and cruel kind of society. I hope the leaders would show more vision and moderation. It is sad what we have become. The mood is toxic and the judiciary will not want to be seen as out of sync with the public mood,&quot; he told the Guardian before the verdict. The trial of five of the attackers started in February. One defendant, Ram Singh, a bus driver and the brother of Mukesh, hanged himself in prison in March. The oldest of the six men accused of the attack on the physiotherapy student, he was alleged by police to have been the ringleader. The youngest among the alleged attackers, who was 17 at the time of the assault, was tried separately and was last month sentenced to three years in a juvenile reform home \u2013 the maximum possible punishment under Indian law. The attack provoked outrage in India and sparked protests across the country. It also led to an unprecedented national discussion about sexual violence and calls for widespread changes in cultural attitudes and policing, and legal reform. The international image of the country was damaged, with numbers of female tourists dropping significantly. Relatives of the accused have spoken out against the verdict. &quot;If he would have been a politician&apos;s son this would not have happened with him,&quot; Vinay Sharma&apos;s mother, Champa, told reporters. The prosecution case relied on testimony from 85 witnesses, a statement given by the victim before she died, DNA samples, dental records from bite marks on the victim&apos;s body that matched the teeth of some of the men and the evidence of her male friend. The victim&apos;s friend described how the couple were attacked after boarding the bus on the way home from an evening movie at an upscale shopping mall. The victims were eventually dumped on a roadside layby on the outskirts of Delhi, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. Her ashes were scattered in the Ganges river, near her ancestral village in rural India. The men were also found guilty of robbing another man earlier in the evening of the incident. Police described how the six had set out from the Singh brothers&apos; home in a bus on a &quot;joy ride&quot;. They then tricked the victim and her friend into boarding the bus and assaulted them shortly afterwards. But though laws on sexual assault and harassment were tightened in the aftermath of the incident, serious institutional reforms will take much longer, women&apos;s rights campaigners say. Gang-rapes, acid attacks and other acts of violence against women continue to be reported across India each day. Police in New Delhi believe a rise in rape reports is due partly to an increased willingness by victims to come forward. There were 1,098 cases of rape reported in the capital in the first eight months of this year, more than double the number in the same period last year, according to police data. About 40% of the cases were registered in the first three months in the immediate aftermath of the 16 December incident. Ten women on average complain of being stalked, groped or otherwise harassed in the Indian capital every day. Karuna Nandy, a supreme court lawyer and campaigner, said the focus on high-profile cases distracted from the need to reform the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of the Indian criminal justice system. An eight-year unofficial moratorium on executions ended on 21 November 2012 with the killing of Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani Islamic extremist convicted of multiple murders in the November 2008 terrorist attacks on luxury hotels and other targets in Mumbai, the Indian commercial capital. It was followed on 9 February 2013 by the hanging of Mohammad Afzal Guru, convicted for a terrorist attack in December 2001 on the Indian parliament. The president, Pranab Mukherjee, has rejected 11 clemency pleas since he took office, confirming the death penalty for 17 people. His predecessor took a more lenient approach. The sudden spate of executions has worried anti-capital-punishment campaigners. &quot;In the past year, India has made a full-scale retreat from its previous principled rejection of the death penalty,&quot; Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said last month. According to disputed official figures, there have been 52 executions in India since the country gained its independence in 1947. Many claim that hundreds more occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s. India has twice voted against United Nations resolutions demanding a global moratorium on capital punishment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/13/delhi-gang-rape-relief-india-men-sentenced-death", "sentences": ["The woman, whose identity is protected by Indian law, suffered massive internal injuries from repeated penetration with an iron bar and died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-13T14:34:40Z", "title": "Delhi gang-rape: four men sentenced to death", "tags": ["India", "Rape and sexual assault", "World news", "Gender", "Women", "Law"], "article": "     Four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old physiotherapist in Delhi last year were sentenced to death on Friday after public calls for them to be hanged.

He told the Guardian: &quot;A lot still needs to be done to make women feel safe in this city. A public hanging would have been great.&quot; Nonetheless, many in India expressed relief that India&apos;s criminal justice system, despite its many weakness, had at least functioned in this case. &quot;Finally we can say Indian judiciary works,&quot; said Malhotra outside the courtroom, where a crowd cheered as the verdict was announced. Newspapers said before the sentencing that there was a &quot;strong case for [the] death penalty&quot; and the country&apos;s usually argumentative televised debates have struggled to overcome unanimity of opinion on the issue. Sushil Kumar Shinde, the Indian home minister, took the unusual step earlier this week of telling reporters that a death sentence was assured \u2013 an indication, observers have suggested, of the government&apos;s concern about public anger with the authorities&apos; handling of the case. The ruling Congress party has been heavily criticised for its slow and insensitive response following the crime. &quot;There was an atmosphere in the country after this incident \u2026 we expected such a punishment,&quot; Shinde said on Friday. The sentence will now be automatically referred to a high court bench of two judges who will consider the sentence and any appeal.

Britain&apos;s national newspapers have carried 54 articles in the past fortnight alone containing the words &quot;house price bubble&quot;. But official figures from the Office of National Statistics will prompt many to ask, &quot;Bubble? What bubble?&quot; Readers in Scotland must scratch their heads every time they see another headline about explosive price growth. Across Scotland, the ONS says, house prices are down 2% over the past year: in July 2012 the average home in Scotland sold for \u00a3184,000, but now it fetches on average \u00a32,000 less. In Northern Ireland, the collapse of the property market has been spectacular, and shows only the most feeble signs of recovery. Average prices peaked in the province at \u00a3249,000 in August 2007 and now stand at \u00a3132,000 \u2013 just a small upturn on the \u00a3125,000 floor hit in 2012. In the West Midlands prices have climbed back up, but hardly merit the description &quot;bubble&quot;. On average a home in the region costs \u00a3184,000, just \u00a32,000 ahead of the level hit in 2007. What is apparent is that the bloated, bilious, fat-bellied excrescence that is the London property market is garbling all the averages. A property in London now costs on average \u00a3438,000. As the credit crunch unfolded in 2007 price rises temporarily halted at about \u00a3340,000, but soon returned to a gallop. Between June and July 2013 they rose by an astonishing \u00a313,000 \u2013 that&apos;s \u00a3565 every working day. That month you would have to put aside \u00a370 every working hour just to keep pace with the explosion of house prices in the capital. Fine for Gareth Bale, perhaps, but not for anyone else. Don&apos;t even ask if there is a bubble in London. How much it continues to inflate, though, is the real question. Puzzled Londoners, whose pay is rising by 1% or 2% a year, wonder just who is paying these prices? The answer seems to be foreigners. Last week, David Newnes, a director of LSL, the second biggest estate agency in the UK, told me that at one of its London agencies, Marsh &amp; Parsons, two-thirds of purchases are made in cash, and two-thirds of those are to foreign buyers. The London bubble presents tough choices for policymakers. The Bank of England&apos;s tool-kit is full of instruments that are powerful, but blunt. Britain probably needs flat interest rates in Burnley, but rising rates in Battersea. The Bank can order caps on loan-to-values (no more 95% loans perhaps, or no more 35-year mortgages) that would cool the market in Hackney, but kill it in Hartlepool. It could limit banks from offering jumbo-sized loans for house purchase \u2013 and have zero impact on the flood of cash buyers from Singapore to Sydney pouring into the capital. Last night, business secretary Vince Cable said on BBC Newsnight that he remains committed to the government&apos;s Help to Buy scheme, which from January extends to all homes, not just new builds, but that there are a variety of ways of introducing it, hinting at different speeds in different parts of the country. The Bank of England now needs to find ways to sharpen its tools so that when intervention comes, as it must, it is the capital that bears the brunt, not the regions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/sep/18/warwick-policy-lab-politics-thinktanks", "sentences": ["I am writing this from Singapore, where I am the Ngee Ann Kongsi visiting professor in International Relations at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-18T13:21:00Z", "title": "Warwick policy lab will fill important spaces in government debate", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Policy", "Collaboration", "Thinktanks", "Society Professionals"], "article": "Warwick&apos;s policy lab is an old initiative reborn. The purpose of the lab, as former cabinet secretary Lord O&apos;Donnell put it, is &apos;to provide a strictly impartial and evidence-based perspective&apos;. That it is needed now points to the failures in the way universities, policy-makers and thinktanks have interacted in the past. Universities produce wonderful analyses of a range of issues which are often highly abstract. I would defend to the end the necessity of such work \u2013 breakthroughs in understanding are generally made in the academic sphere. But universities struggle to make such work relevant and comprehensible to the policy maker, whose interests are defined by what is quick and possible. But it&apos;s a two-way street and policymakers have been unwilling to engage with universities, and have not provided incentives to encourage academics to communicate their findings better. Academic excellence has traditionally been measured on quality and quantity of publications in academic journals, rather than impact in the public policy realm. The research excellence framework, which will produce results next year on the relative standing of research in all UK disciplines and universities, has introduced an element to evaluate &apos;impact&apos;. This could be a step forward. The lack of communication has, in part, opened up a space between universities and the policy community which thinktanks seek to fill. Indeed, in many respects thinktanks started out like policy labs. Chatham House, for example, originated in the peace conference at the end of world war one out of a desire to use evidence in the policy sphere to prevent the outbreak of future wars. However, thinktanks have been heavily politicised. They use evidence but often for political purposes and are right leaning or left leaning, Labour or Conservative. Policy Exchange claims to be the UK&apos;s leading thinktank and talks of the evidence base of its work, but is clearly aligned with the political right. The Institute of Public Policy Research claims to be the UK&apos;s leading evidence-based progressive thinktank, but is clearly associated with the left. My hope is that the Warwick policy lab will be like Chatham House at its origins: evidence based, without leaning left or right. I am writing this from Singapore, where I am the Ngee Ann Kongsi visiting professor in International Relations at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University. It is an extraordinary entity: a graduate school which produces academic research, but primarily a thinktank. It is a model of how a university can contribute to public service. The Warwick policy lab may, however, have its limits The lab is likely to focus on the economy, wellbeing, issues of investment and recovery. My own field is that of international security, much more difficult for three reasons: \u2022 First, evidence is often secret \u2013 the last bastion of the sovereign state, arguably, is the intelligence services. \u2022 Second, without that evidence, independent judgement is hard. Whatever your view of the Iraq war, you will probably accept that the &apos;dodgy&apos; dossier was inaccurate in its claims about Iraq&apos;s weapons of mass destruction. The highly respected thinktank International Institute for Strategic Studies rushed to judgement, and endorsement, but five years later commissioned a review into that judgement. It is hard to get things right when you are short of full information. \u2022 Third, events move with incredible speed. A bomb attack here, a coup there \u2013 few can be predicted even by the best analysts with the best software. The variables are too great. But this is not a counsel of despair. Even in the field of security, there are important spaces for the Warwick policy lab: in providing evidence but also being explicit about what we do not know. The Warwick policy lab is itself an experiment, an attempt to rebalance the relationship between evidence and politics.

A seed of a rumour at lunchtime, it grew with such rapidity that it had touched almost every motorhome before sunset. A combination of Alonso&apos;s grumpiness at Ferrari after the signing of Kimi Raikkonen to partner him next season, and McLaren&apos;s dilatoriness in signing up Jenson Button and Sergio P\u00e9rez for 2014, have spawned a rumour that may yet be self-fulfilling: Formula One is driven by gossip as much as its rich fuel mix. McLaren&apos;s senior driver Button not only failed to kill the speculation but gave it greater momentum. When asked &quot;How would you feel driving with Fernando next season?&quot; Button replied: &quot;I think it would be quite exciting. There are many team-mates in Formula One who I would be excited about working with. &quot;Even though I am 33 years old and one of the oldest drivers on the grid, I still feel as though there is a lot to learn. There are certain drivers you can learn more from than others and I think that it can benefit any team who has two experienced drivers.&quot; Asked whether he was friends with Alonso, he said: &quot;The only people I really hang out with are Paul Di Resta and Mark Webber, but I have a lot of respect for Fernando, he has been around as long as I have. We have had a lot of racing experiences in different teams. We also worked together in 2002 when he was our test driver at Renault. &quot;We have had some interesting times and I have a lot of respect for the guy. It&apos;s been a difficult year for him.&quot; Button&apos;s contract with McLaren expires at the end of the year, though the team are almost certain to exercise the one-year option they have and also give him the added assurances he wants for 2015, when a new Honda power plant is expected to lift the team form its current malaise. &quot;It is just that things take a bit of time. Obviously there is a big change in the team \u2013 with Honda coming in \u2013 it is just different and not a continuation. It is a different situation with partners. But I have not a worry in the world about my future with this team. It is a very exciting future and I hope it&apos;s a long future.&quot; There were high hopes for P\u00e9rez, who replaced Lewis Hamilton when their leading driver joined Mercedes at the end of last year, but the Mexican languishes in 12th place, behind Force India&apos;s Adrian Sutil, with just 18 points. Asked whether he had signed a fresh contract for next season, P\u00e9rez replied: &quot;We&apos;ve been having some discussions about the contract. It&apos;s pretty much everything done, I think. We&apos;re just finalising the dots.&quot; One dot might be adding more weight through sponsorship. Alonso had one unhappy season with McLaren, in 2007, but his problems stemmed from Hamilton&apos;s rookie brilliance and the team principal Ron Dennis&apos;s autocratic management style; Hamilton is no longer there and Dennis is no longer running the team. The love affair between Alonso and Ferrari has become strained on both sides. Ferrari have taken exception to some of Alonso&apos;s critical comments. Alonso, meanwhile, has been disappointed by the signing of the 2007 champion Raikkonen, who will not be as compliant as the sacked Felipe Massa in allowing the Spaniard to have everything his own way. Alonso&apos;s contract with Ferrari, however, extends to the end of 2016, and he is likely to remain at Maranello until at least the end of next year. Ferrari&apos;s curious signing of Raikkonen, who is roughly the same age as Alonso, would suggest that this is a short-term fix while the team awaits the expected arrival of Sebastian Vettel further down the line. Meanwhile, Raikkonen says he left Lotus over pay. He said: &quot;The reasons why I left from the team are purely on the money side. That is an unfortunate thing.&quot; At Lotus Raikkonen is believed to be the third best paid driver in F1, behind Alonso and Hamilton. He is thought to be earning about \u00a315m, although much of his pay is bonus-related. And it is his earning of those bonuses which have both cost Lotus and attracted Ferrari&apos;s indulgent eye."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/20/fernando-alonso-mclaren-return-ferrari", "sentences": ["Following the practice sessions for Sunday&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix, Alonso said: &quot;I repeat it more or less every weekend and I keep repeating it \u2013 I love Ferrari and I will stay at Ferrari until the end."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T18:16:00Z", "title": "Fernando Alonso quashes rumours of return to McLaren", "tags": ["Fernando Alonso", "Formula One 2013", "Ferrari", "McLaren", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "Fernando Alonso has ruled out the possibility of a return to McLaren \u2013 just hours after Martin Whitmarsh, the team principal of the Spaniard&apos;s former employers, confirmed that he would like to sign the Ferrari driver. Following the practice sessions for Sunday&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix, Alonso said: &quot;I repeat it more or less every weekend and I keep repeating it \u2013 I love Ferrari and I will stay at Ferrari until the end. It&apos;s nice to hear comments from all the team principals every year saying they respect my job and personality, especially McLaren.&quot; Alonso added that he had no hard feelings towards McLaren following his difficult season there in 2007, when he clashed with Lewis Hamilton and the then team principal, Ron Dennis. &quot;There were so many rumours that we had a lot of problems that year but I always said that there are no problems with anyone, it was just the philosophy of the team, especially one man in the team that is not there [any more]. I have three more years with Ferrari and I hope many more to come if we can extend the contract and that would be my hope.&quot; Earlier in the day, Whitmarsh, when asked whether he would like to sign the Spaniard, replied: &quot;Yes, any team would. He&apos;s the best driver,&quot; while McLaren&apos;s managing director, Jonathan Neale, said there was &quot;a lot going on behind the scenes. We want a strong driver lineup.&quot; But McLaren never had any chance of landing Alonso before 2015, when the team&apos;s new engine deal with Honda will make them a more attractive proposition, even though the driver was known to be grumpy about the signing of Kimi Raikkonen in place of Felipe Massa. Now Alonso, 32, appears to have ruled out any chance of a future return. Whitmarsh&apos;s comments about Alonso may also have represented an effort to squeeze the best deal he can as he completes negotiations with Sergio P\u00e9rez and his Mexican sponsors. Jenson Button is already certain to stay with the Woking-based team next season and he will be joined, once again, by P\u00e9rez. McLaren do have misgivings about P\u00e9rez&apos;s performances this season \u2013 he is 12th in the championship behind Force India&apos;s Adrian Sutil, and 30 points behind Button \u2013 but the driver will stay where he is. Whitmarsh admitted: &quot;I expect next year our driver lineup to stay the same, but we are open to anything and in the longer term [Alonso] would be a great asset.&quot; A little further down the paddock, at Lotus, there is much less fanciful speculation about who they will sign to replace Raikkonen next year. The best choice would be Nico H\u00fclkenberg, with whom they have already spoken. The German is the most likely new world champion, even though he has spent his career making crab-like sideways moves from one midfield team to another \u2013 Williams to Force India to Sauber and now Lotus, or possibly back to Force India. As he prepared for Sunday&apos;s race, he said: &quot;My priority is to find a good deal and a good car, a competitive car and a good package. Nothing is finalised. Nothing has been decided at this point. I&apos;m trying to sort out all options and then come up with a good decision for the future.&quot; Hulkenberg is the signing Ferrari would have made if they had more sense, although their strange move for Raikkonen would lend more credence to the story that Vettel is the driver they are really waiting to sign in two or three years. Hulkenberg was Ferrari&apos;s second choice after Raikkonen. Hulkenberg would also have been a better bet than Perez for McLaren. He has not yet won a podium place but has impressed everyone, not only for his basic speed but for his ability to sieze a moment, such as his shattering pole-winning performance in Brazil three years ago. H\u00fclkenberg is the man Lotus want. Their only problem will be in persuading the German that they have the resources to not only pay him but also to push the team on to greater things. Another name being mentioned is Massa. The only problem, as Ferrari would disconsolately confirm, is that for such an experienced and skilful driver the Brazilian is not as consistent as he should be, and has not shown he can be the performer he was before his serious accident in 2009. Lotus are the super-middleweights of Formula One. The only problem is that in their admirable and partially successful attempts to mix it with the heavyweights they have exposed, in financial terms, a glass jaw. While they have waited for the money to arrive following their reported summer deal with Infinity Racing, they have looked on helplessly as Ferrari have signed not only Raikkonen but the technical director James Allison and the aerodynamics expert Dirk de Beer. Their plight was made abundantly clear earlier this week when Raikkonen said he had not been paid by the Enstone, Oxfordshire-based team. The team principal, \u00c9ric Boullier is proud of Lotus&apos;s &quot;fresh, young, active and dynamic approach&quot;, but when he says: &quot;We can afford to be much more open and direct with our fans,&quot; it is about all he can\u00a0afford. Two years ago Lotus lost arguably the most consistent driver in F1 in Robert Kubica. They bounced back from that last year to finish fourth in the constructors&apos; championship and would now be tussling with Mercedes and Ferrari for second place if only the fast but mercurial Romain Grosjean had produced more solid results. Now they must rebuild again. Boullier, though, insists he is not looking for a pay driver to help his finances. &quot;For me, it&apos;s important [the new driver] comes without sponsorship. I&apos;m racing to win, I&apos;m not racing just for the cash. The right strategy for a Formula One team, if you want to be a top team, is to choose your drivers on merit because they fit your strategy and sports model, but not based on sponsorship.&quot; His shortlist, he says, &quot;is actually quite long, with some fun names, surprising names.&quot; On the track on Friday, Lewis Hamilton, who won here in 2009 and was robbed of another victory last year when hit by gearbox trouble, topped the morning practice run. But Red Bull reasserted themselves in the afternoon session when Vettel \u2013 winner of the past two races here \u2013 and Mark Webber were first and second, ahead of the Mercedes pair of Nico Rosberg and Hamilton."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/21/this-weeks-new-films-metro-manila", "sentences": ["Mister John An Irish loner is cut adrift in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-21T05:00:00Z", "title": "Metro Manila, Diana, The Call: this week's new films", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "9.79*", "Cold Comes The Night", "The Call", "Diana", "Harrigan", "InRealLife", "Kelly + Victor", "Mademoiselle C", "Metro Manila", "A Belfast Story", "Phata Poster Nikla Hero"], "article": "Metro Manila (15) (Sean Ellis, 2013, UK/Phi) Jake Macapagal, Althea Vega, John Arcilla. 115 mins Street-level social drama slyly develops into gripping crime thriller in this resourceful Anglo-Asian movie, a distinctive spin on the familiar theme of innocent country folk in the corrupting city.

Roy Theobald as a young lance corporal on duty in Malaya in 1960.    But I wanted Dad to have a good holiday and I thought we had some catching up to do. I didn&apos;t see him much as a kid in the 1970s as he ran a fish and chip restaurant in Cornwall, a physically demanding and fast-paced job involving hoisting barrels of chips into pans, whisking up vats of batter, cutting up fish early in the morning and getting home late at night after bleaching the floors and chucking out the last of the drunks. When I was very young, I remember sitting squashed up by the radiator next to the end of the settee where he used to sit so I could be as close to him as possible. He&apos;d be smoking a cigarette, the backs of his hands covered in blisters from fat splashes. Sometimes, he&apos;d blow smoke rings, a magical skill it seemed to me then and one he told me he&apos;d learned on national service. Sometimes I&apos;d wear a green jungle hat and a purple-ribboned medal, other mementos of his time in Malaya that I&apos;d found in old boxes. It&apos;s a strange return for Dad. We&apos;re staying at the Fort Canning hotel in Singapore, a handsome colonial-style building that functioned as the British Far East Command headquarters up to the time when General Arthur Percival surrendered Singapore to the invading Japanese. Set in lush parkland, surrounded by spice gardens and gothic gates, a lance corporal in charge of the clothing stores, like Dad, would never have come here in the 1960s. &quot;Bloody hell!&quot; he keeps groaning in awe at everything from the balustrades to a new thing to him, Bircher muesli, about which he plans to report back to Becky at Slimming World. The thing I&apos;m realising, as this crash course with my dad progresses, is that he possesses that invaluable skill of being able to enjoy life. He&apos;s equally wowed by our trip to the hotel&apos;s curio jewel, the Battle Box, a live/work bunker where General Percival made the decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese 17 years before Dad even arrived in south-east Asia. &quot;I only knew Fort Canning as the British army headquarters \u2013 full of senior officers and not for the likes of me!&quot; he jokes as we go in. In the Battle Box, I learn how the Japanese came down through Malaysia on bicycles during the second world war, butchering as they went. There are life-like mannequins made by the Madame Tussaud&apos;s people and bombing sound effects abound. I think Dad&apos;s a bit perturbed to hear an actual battle going on. &quot;My time here was like a long holiday, really,&quot; he reflects as we come out. &quot;Playing at soldiers, we used to call it.&quot; On day two, he takes me for a drink to Raffles. Back in the day, he and his friends clubbed together and bought an old banger they used to drive down to Singapore from their camp, known as 221 BVD (Base Vehicle Depot), in Johor Bahru in Malaysia. The lower ranking soldiers would go to the (now defunct) Britannia swimming baths opposite Raffles, although they never dared to go into the hotel for a drink \u2013 &quot;We couldn&apos;t afford it.&quot; But this evening we enter the imposing hotel, now choked on all sides by huge skyscrapers. He takes me to the upstairs Long Bar, where he orders the drinks (Gin Sling for me and Tiger beer for himself) and brings them over himself on a tray. It&apos;s like he&apos;s still rushing around carrying a barrel of chips. He trips but doesn&apos;t fall. He&apos;s tripped three times already, and it&apos;s worrying me. The day I pass though the &quot;hanging-out-with-your-father&quot; wall is the day I finally drive him over from Singapore to Malaysia to visit his old national service stomping ground in Johore Bahru. (You&apos;re not allowed to drive a hired car if you&apos;re over 75 in Singapore.) It&apos;s not the easiest of days. I&apos;m still in fullest jetlag mode, I lose my Singapore immigration papers at customs, the GPS breaks down at the Malaysian border, the 60km journey has already taken more than three hours, thanks to the terrible traffic and Dad keeps looking ruefully out of the window saying things like, &quot;Of course, it&apos;s completely changed \u2013 you can&apos;t recognise anything.&quot; I want Dad to have that mythical thing \u2013 a holiday of a lifetime \u2013 but now I&apos;m wondering if I&apos;m going to be able to pull that off. We&apos;re looking for the old waterfall where he and his best friends (lance corporals in charge of the armoury and bedding stores, respectively) used to swim at weekends. It&apos;s somewhere near the town of Kota Tinggi and \u2013 miraculously \u2013 we find it, even though, as he says, roads were just sandy tracks in the 1960s. Still, when we arrive, he declares that it now looks like a Butlins holiday camp. The lower part of the falls has been developed into a water park called Wet World, but I&apos;m still impressed. Once you leave the man-made stuff behind and carry on up the slope, the natural geography is reassuringly unchanged. It&apos;s a massive body of water carved out of the rocks and surrounded with vivid green jungle trees and plants and red-eyed geckos jumping out from behind clumps of moss as you climb higher and higher. I&apos;m doing the same climb my dad went on before I was born. We carry on up, past Korean tourists who never dive-bombed into these pools in the 1960s. He tells me to wait until we get to the top for a swim because that&apos;s the best pool. Finally, at the summit, he slows down. He stops and looks down into water cascading into rock-carved basins and who knows what he sees there? When he asks a Korean tourist to take our picture, I can feel my eyes start to prickle. All the pent-up tension of the car comes rushing out like a waterfall. I&apos;m considering saying something I&apos;d never say to my dad, something like, &quot;I love you, Daddy,&quot; because this is his place \u2013 this is where he was young and strong and all the world lay sparkling ahead of him on the horizon. But the moment passes. I don&apos;t say, &quot;I love you&quot; and all he says is, &quot;I expect the Japanese used to come here and swim.&quot; We go and sit down on the rocks where he used to sunbathe with his friends. He makes a passing comment about how it&apos;d be good &quot;if some of the boys were here&quot;. And that&apos;s when something snaps into place. Suddenly, I stop seeing my father as my father. Or rather I start seeing him as the man who became my father. I think back to the national service pictures I was flicking through on Dad&apos;s iPad the other night. A man making a silly face with a rifle, the same man joshing around in camp with bottles of beer or trying to look sophisticated on the terrace of the Britannia swimming club in Singapore. These past few days, I&apos;ve seen flashes of a man who&apos;s more like some on-leave squaddie than my father, the responsible fish-and-chip man. Take that story he told me at breakfast about how, when the truck came to pick them up in Singapore to drive them back to Malaya after a weekend&apos;s leave, a woman would try to sell them fruit. &quot;She&apos;d be going, &apos;Banana, Johnny? Johnny want banana?&apos; And we&apos;d eat the bananas and throw the skins on the ground.&quot; He grins. &quot;We were sods!&quot;     Stephanie and Roy on their south-east Asian trip.    Not that Dad is that well rehearsed in his new role as the on-leave squaddie. One day he tells me about his leave in Hong Kong one time. There&apos;s mention of a &quot;half day&quot; rate as opposed to the &quot;full night rate&quot; when we&apos;re having a chat about how things differed in his experience of national service and the stuff that happens in Leslie Thomas&apos;s saucy classic, Virgin Soldiers. But he quickly stops and says, &quot;Of course, this isn&apos;t the sort of thing I normally talk about.&quot; Not to his daughter, in any case. As the roaring white water cascades down behind my head, I suddenly spot a show-offy butterfly with wings like a Japanese fan that lands on the rocks next to me. It&apos;s good timing as it&apos;s something to take my mind off the intensity of what&apos;s happening. I try to fade into the background a bit so Dad can feel he doesn&apos;t have to play &quot;dad&quot; for a bit. I go for a swim in the deep basin and thoughts of sperm, and fish and how my dad swam in this pool six years before I existed, come to mind. Now I&apos;m glad he brought me here. On our way out of Wet World, I drive us off to the second lump-in-the-throat moment of the day. We stop at a military-looking place on the main road back to Singapore. Dad tells a sentry that he&apos;s looking for his old army camp. &quot;I was a solder here in the 1960s: 221 BVD, remember?&quot; The soldier is about 20 and Dad is speaking very fast, yet he says, &quot;Yes, I know where the camp is, please follow me.&quot; Dad says, &quot;Oh thank you, that&apos;s very kind of you.&quot; It seems as though it&apos;s going to be a perfect day, what with the falls and now the discovery of the camp. The soldier leads us down the road, to where 221 BVD used to be based, now called Papan Aktiviti Pulada.     Roy with two Malaysian soldiers at a military base.    The commanding officer gives us a nice welcome and asks us to wait in the guardroom, which contains six iron bunk beds \u2013 with a couple of soldiers still asleep in them. Dad takes out the iPad to show a group of three others who gather around the desk what this camp looked like 55 years ago. They look genuinely interested. But then the officer comes back and says he&apos;s been told he can&apos;t take us on a tour for security reasons and I&apos;ll have to write to the Malaysian army to get permission. It&apos;s a disappointing moment. I mutter to one of the soldiers, &quot;Do you think a bribe would help?&quot; I happen to have a $20 note in my pocket. His look says no. We&apos;re both disappointed as we leave to drive back to Singapore. But things are better back at Fort Canning hotel. We have Tiger beers on the balmy terrace and talk about Mum and how Dad&apos;s sad she never took the stop-your-fear-of-flying course, how he doesn&apos;t think he&apos;ll be coming back to this part of the world again. But also happy things. There&apos;s a depth to this night. But maybe I&apos;m just saying that because I&apos;m a daughter and he&apos;s a dad. When I get home and show my holiday pictures to my partner, I point out my favourite: Pa with his arm draped paternally around the shoulders of the young Malaysian soldier at the 221 BVD camp. My partner doesn&apos;t see that at all. &quot;Nice picture of your dad with that mischievous squaddie glint in his eye,&quot; he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/21/sebastian-vettel-singapore-f1-grand-prix-pole", "sentences": ["Vettel sat out almost the last three minutes of Q3 after completing just one run but still finished ahead of Nico Rosberg, Romain Grosjean, Mark Webber and Lewis Hamilton to make himself a clear favourite to win Sunday&apos;s Singapore Grand Prix."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-21T14:21:42Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel claims Singapore F1 Grand Prix pole for Red Bull", "tags": ["Formula One 2013", "Sebastian Vettel", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Red Bull", "Sport"], "article": "Sebastian Vettel sat back in the comfort of his Red Bull motor home and watched himself win his 41st pole here on Saturday.

That Vettel also drove within himself when he was out there was dispiriting for his rivals. The German is 53 points ahead of second-placed Fernando Alonso in the drivers&apos; championship. It was his sixth pole of the season and his third in three races. He has won the last two races here. &quot;I knew we would have a cushion which is why we decided not to run again,&quot; he said. &quot;We thought it was good enough, in the end it was.&quot; He added: &quot;It is a weird feeling because you stand in the garage when there are two minutes left and know it is too late and see others on final attempts and there&apos;s nothing you can do. I was watching the sector times very closely. Mark started with purple sector one, Romain had a purple sector two but fortunately my last one was strong enough to stay ahead. It was close with Nico [Rosberg]. It was a great feeling because it could have gone wrong.&quot; Hamilton admitted he was not quick enough after coming fifth, while it was another disappointing outing for Ferrari, with Alonso qualifying seventh. The Spaniard dismissed suggestions that he could be heading for McLaren, insisting he was ready to finish his career at Ferrari. &quot;I&apos;ve spent the last four races saying I want to stay at Ferrari and maybe extend the contract when they would like,&quot; he said. &quot;We are working very closely on arriving at that situation because I hope to end my career in Formula One with Ferrari. To sit together and to try to do it, that&apos;s my desire, and the team has expressed to me more or less the same desire when we talk about this. That will be a good thing to achieve.&quot; &quot;There have been people racing until 38, 39, with no problems. Mark (Webber) is one of the examples, he has been very competitive, and Michael (Schumacher) also came back at a good age. So 35 is still a good age, so if I keep the motivation and enjoying the sport, like I&apos;m doing now, when the time arrives we will see.&quot; It was worse for Alonso&apos;s new team-mate, Kimi Rakkonen. He qualified 11th for the last race in Italy and he will be 13th on the grid after receiving a pain-killing injection in his lower back. Jenson Button was eighth, Paul di Resta failed to make Q2 but although Max Chilton was last again he finished just behind team-mate Jules Bianchi."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/21/mclaren-sergio-perez-shadowlands", "sentences": ["When P\u00e9rez arrived in Singapore this week he was asked about his future with McLaren."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-21T21:00:05Z", "title": "McLaren and Sergio P\u00e9rez adrift in the F1 shadowlands", "tags": ["Sergio P\u00e9rez", "McLaren", "Formula One", "Fernando Alonso", "Motor sport", "Formula One 2013", "Sport"], "article": "South of the border, down Mexico way, the story is that Sergio P\u00e9rez is close to confirming another season with McLaren. In fact that is the popular notion on most of the raucous planet called Formula One. The reality is a little different. While Jenson Button&apos;s drive with the team in 2014 has been confirmed \u2013 McLaren will make an announcement about this shortly \u2013 the Woking-based team are taking a long hard look at his team-mate before confirming their lineup for next year. McLaren&apos;s much talked about chances of signing Fernando Alonso next season are virtually zero, but if P\u00e9rez interprets that as meaning he is a shoo-in to keep his place next season he is making an important misjudgment. McLaren might even turn to their rookie driver Stoffel Vandoorne to partner Button next season as they intensify their efforts to land Alonso in 2015. These are difficult days for McLaren. The days, in truth, have become long, lean years. Their last constructors&apos; championship was won in 1998 and they collected their last drivers&apos; title in 2008. This year, though, they have fallen back into F1&apos;s midfield. Their struggle with Force India to secure fifth place in the constructors&apos; table looks almost unseemly for Britain&apos;s most successful F1 team. This is shaping up to be the first time since 2006 that they have gone through a season without winning a race. Even more damning, this could become the first season since 1980 in which they have not claimed even a podium place. The loss of Lewis Hamilton to Mercedes at the end of last year was a major blow. But the disappointment this year \u2013 apart from their jalopy of a car \u2013 centres on Hamilton&apos;s replacement, P\u00e9rez, and his lack of competitiveness. Three months ago Sam Michael, McLaren&apos;s genial sporting director, said that P\u00e9rez was &quot;stamping his authority on the sport&quot;. If that was the case P\u00e9rez must have been wearing fluffy soft slippers because no one else noticed. He is 12th in the drivers&apos; championship, behind Force India&apos;s Adrian Sutil, and 30 points adrift of Button. It is McLaren&apos;s concerns over P\u00e9rez, more than anything, which lent such credence to the link with Alonso. When P\u00e9rez arrived in Singapore this week he was asked about his future with McLaren. He said: &quot;The contract is done but we are just finalising the final dots. Everything is pretty much done.&quot; P\u00e9rez remains the most likely man to partner Button next year but there are still obstacles to scale. Martin Whitmarsh hinted as much when the McLaren principal said: &quot;Sergio has a tremendous benchmark in Jenson, who is consistent, a great quality driver, a great team player and who brings a tremendous amount of benefits to our team. &quot;For a young charger like Sergio, he knows and I know that he has to come in and beat him. He hasn&apos;t done that consistently enough this year. He is going to give it a good go this weekend I expect.&quot; P\u00e9rez signed a three-year deal when he joined from Sauber. But that is a one plus one plus one. In other words, McLaren hold an option on retaining him. Button was generous about P\u00e9rez but when he was asked whether he thought the Mexican was championship material he looked a little less certain. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said the champion of 2009. &quot;With a bit more experience he has every opportunity to fight for a championship. It is very different emotionally when you are fighting for a championship. It breaks some people and others rise to it.&quot; While every team faces a major challenge next year, with the switch to 1.6 litre V6 engines, McLaren face a double transition. In 2015 they flip from Mercedes to Honda engines, a move that will also bring them considerable funding. That is when they would love to bring in Alonso, and if Ferrari produce another disappointing car next year their chances cannot be discounted. Another target would be the highly rated Nico Hulkenberg. The German could well be the next new F1world champion, even though his weight (he is not fat but he is tall) counts against him. Hulkenberg, though, could well be a Lotus driver, replacing Kimi Raikkonen, before McLaren make a decision. They are in no hurry. Then there is Vandoorne \u2013 the 21-year-old Belgian is being described as the next Hamilton \u2013 and McLaren&apos;s other young driver, Kevin Magnussen. They are first and second in the Formula Renault 3.5 series. &quot;They are in the frame,&quot; said Whitmarsh. &quot;We are very fortunate at the moment that we have some fantastic young talent coming through and they deserve to be in F1. We have in Kevin and Stoffel two of the hottest talents not in F1, and certainly it is our ambition to get them into F1.&quot; The lights will be shining on everyone in the year&apos;s only night race on Sunday. But for P\u00e9rez they will carry an interrogatory harshness."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/sep/22/pink-panthers-diamond-thieves-documentary", "sentences": ["Their exploits have become the stuff of legend, with jobs ranging from London to Tokyo, Geneva to Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-22T09:30:00Z", "title": "The Pink Panthers: hunting the world's best diamond thieves", "tags": ["Graff jewellery robbery", "Documentary", "Film", "Crime", "UK news"], "article": "Hidden cameras on the walls of the exclusive Wafi shopping mall in Dubai captured, in 2007, two Audi S8s smashing through its glass doors. The first \u2013 white with silver wheels \u2013 crashes through in reverse, while the second \u2013 a black car with a woman at the wheel \u2013 drives head on. The white car pauses briefly as a man in a black bodysuit and balaclava jumps out before the driver hits the gas again. You have to imagine the screeching of tyres as they speed on through the public atrium and reverse the car into the door of the Graff jewellery store. The man in black runs into the shop and another joins him; both are carrying revolvers in one hand and small pickaxes in the other, and have pouches attached to their bodies. The store attendants run for their lives and the men calmly, systematically, start to break through display cases. At each one they seem to smash the glass and grab the jewels in one smooth move. You assume they have done this before. While the security footage resembles a\u00a0movie, really it&apos;s just a typical night&apos;s work for the Pink Panthers \u2013 the most successful diamond-thieving gang in history. At the last count they had committed 341 armed robberies and aggravated thefts around the world, with an estimated value of stolen goods of \u00a4330m. Their exploits have become the stuff of legend, with jobs ranging from London to Tokyo, Geneva to Singapore. The gang, a\u00a0loosely affiliated network of an estimated 200 to 220 people, pull off jobs with precision and style, dressing as golfers for one job, Hawaiian tourists for another, workmen for one more. They can escape by speedboat, scooter or bicycle depending on the location, and take full advantage of soft borders and false documents. They know that as long as they get back home \u2013 to various Balkan countries \u2013 they will be safe, protected by either corrupt or hopeless officials. The Dubai robbery was stunning for the amount they stole ($3.4m), the time it took (in 170 seconds they had left the store, jumped back in their cars and left the building), and the precision of their planning. The gang only drives Audis \u2013 you can&apos;t do a robbery driving a car you don&apos;t know; it&apos;s too risky. But Audi was a make virtually unknown in the Middle East in 2007 and getaway cars have to be found and stolen just hours before a robbery. The S8 is the brand&apos;s flagship high-performing car: so rare was the model in Dubai that one of the cars was stolen in the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi and driven across the border. The thieves reverse-rammed the car so the airbag wouldn&apos;t open on impact and so that the car was in the perfect position to drive away. They planned the timing of the heist (9pm) at the end of the rush hour, knowing that when they fled down the highway the lanes in the opposite direction \u2013 from where the police would come \u2013 would be jammed. They drove to a deserted, unlit patch of land between two mansions \u2013 just minutes away from the royal palace \u2013 and set fire to the two cars. In a now completely unknown third car, they drove calmly into the night with their multimillion-dollar booty. So who are the Pink Panthers? I have been trying to answer that question for three years, since I first arrived in Belgrade to shoot a documentary on them. Armed with two phone numbers, I travelled down to Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, to try to track them down. My contact had arranged various introductions, and I was told to go alone and with no mobile phone to a deserted war memorial on the outskirts of town. It was a good spot for a meeting: private, discreet, hidden by trees. As I waited, I realised it was also a good spot for a drug deal, a heist or a murder, which was when I got nervous. A beaten-up blue Peugeot estate pulled up alongside me. &quot;Please excuse my car,&quot; said a man in perfect English. &quot;We like to travel quietly down here.&quot; This was Novak, a tall man in his 50s wearing white trousers, a pink polo shirt and a gold tooth. I got into the car and we drove to a local bar. He explained he was an alarms and electrics specialist for the Pink Panthers. He&apos;d been looking forward to meeting me, he said; he loved journalism \u2013 he had been a local fixer for newspaper hacks during the wars of the 1990s. He smuggled reporters in, got them false documents and researched their stories. It was the perfect training ground for his current work: strategic thinking, adrenalin, cash, danger. And also, according to Novak, a moral high ground. There are &quot;no victims to what we do&quot;, Novak told me. &quot;We scare people but we do not hurt them. We only take expensive things from rich people.&quot; It&apos;s the mythology the Pink Panthers try to promote, and he has a point: despite the fact that they terrify the life out of people working in the shop, until last year no one had been seriously injured in a Pink Panthers robbery.     Daylight robbers: (from left) suspects in the Dubai robbery Dusko Poznan, Bojana Mitic and Milan Ljepoja.  Photograph: Observer    My meeting with NOVAK opens doors. A few weeks later I meet Mike at a bar on the coast in the height of summer: he is darkly tanned, in navy shorts and boat shoes. Apart from the scars on his arms, he would walk the Croisette well. He, too, is wearing a pink polo shirt. We joke: it&apos;s the equivalent of a carnation on a\u00a0blind date. &quot;I don&apos;t have a badge that says Pink Panther on it,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;It&apos;s nothing to do with us, this name. But I do like those films\u2026 Everyone in the Balkans knows The Pink Panther.&quot; It was the Daily Mail which named the gang after Peter Sellers&apos;s famous Inspector Clouseau film, after two thieves pulled off the largest jewel heist in British history at Graff, the Bond Street jewellers, in 2003. Within days Scotland Yard had identified a Montenegrin man living in Bayswater. When they raided his London flat they found, among other things, a\u00a0blue diamond ring worth $750,000 in a tub of face cream. Mike is a safe-cracker. He learned his trade while apprenticed as a teenager to a Kosovan criminal in Italy. &quot;Mechanical, numerical, digital ones \u2013 I can crack them all. Digital safes are the easiest: you just dust them and see the fingerprints and you know everything. Numerical ones are the hardest: you have to have very good hearing and a very good memory.&quot; Mike is also very paranoid. This, he tells me, is &quot;a hazard of the job&quot;. He pops Valium like aspirin. The mainstream concept of a\u00a0&quot;mafia&quot; is entirely informed by what we know of the Italian families \u2013 a strict hierarchy, a top dog, initiation ceremonies, and a lot of murder. The Pink Panthers are very different. &quot;We are a network of teams working together,&quot; Mike tells me. &quot;As soon as I got involved I\u00a0became part of the network.&quot; The structure is likened by Interpol to al-Qaeda \u2013 the ultimate contemporary crime gang \u2013 in that it is a\u00a0series of cells that come and go overnight, working independently. They share methods, they share contacts and they share origins, but it is to everyone&apos;s advantage that links are thin. &quot;There is an inner circle,&quot; explains Mike, &quot;who have been doing this a long time, and we call each other family, but there are guys who don&apos;t know who their bosses or associates are. You have to be with them a long time dealing with the bigger jobs. You get tips from your supervisor \u2013 but there is also a wider chain of people. You don&apos;t know where you stand in the hierarchy because you never meet the &apos;boss&apos;. There is no &apos;Big Boss&apos;.Everyone has their specific job to do, so we all depend on each other.&quot; You can&apos;t visit the Balkans without recent history looming large. Many, many people are still furious or bitter or heartbroken, scarred by the vicious, terrible wars. Buildings in Belgrade are still bombed out. Factories lie empty, crumbling as poverty-stricken townsfolk remember the golden days of Yugoslavia. The people who aren&apos;t angry are the ones\u00a0who either got away or made money from that period. The Panthers did both. Mike was a classic example. A boy and teenager under Tito, he grew up in a communist dream: enough to eat, a great education, an excellent athlete and proud of his glorious nation. But after the death of Tito in 1980 Yugoslavia began to fall. Republics began to compete, and a very nasty nationalism became the political weapon of choice. &quot;I was ethnically Albanian, but living in Serbia,&quot; says Mike. &quot;The hatred became visible. Just pure hatred. Everything was cracking open.&quot;     To catch a thief: filmmaker Havana Marking in the CCTV room at the Wafi Mall in Dubai. Photograph: Observer    As Yugoslavia collapsed around them, the fate of the nation became apparent: conflict, militias and a total criminalisation of the state. It was the 1992 UN sanctions against Yugoslavia that really determined the fate of the Pink Panthers. Entire industries in Serbia collapsed, creating a generation of people either forced or willing to take part in criminal activities. Once you have to smuggle food, soap or diesel to make life possible, what&apos;s to stop you smuggling arms, drugs and people to make life profitable? It paved the way for the hugely powerful international heroin, sex and gun gangs that still trade today: the small and mostly localised smuggling routes over the mountains, across lakes and between bays became international pathways. A few years later, diamonds joined the routes. I asked people I met in the region what they thought of the gang. And while almost everyone acknowledged that stealing was wrong, the statement was usually followed by a glint in the eye and a sentiment along the lines of: &quot;You have to admit they are good at it.&quot; One man in a marketplace became passionate: &quot;If I was the government, I would encourage the Panthers to go and hit all the foreign jewellers, under one condition: that they bring the booty home!&quot; He saw the robberies as revenge for the Nato bombings and UN sanctions of Serbia in the 1990s \u2013 &quot;England, America, France, Japan\u2026 they ruined this country.&quot; I had asked Mike about women in the gang. They are usually hardly mentioned in\u00a0the reports of the robberies. I had been told by Interpol officers in Belgrade that they were mere eye candy, irrelevant to the actual job. On\u00a0the contrary, Mike said. &quot;Women in the\u00a0Panthers have to be exceptional. We have\u00a0high requirements of them because they have the leading roles, but you can only have one in each gang. She has to be intelligent. She\u00a0has to be beautiful. And she has to love money very much\u2026&quot; And so Mike introduces me to Lela, a past associate and friend of his. She is extremely pretty, in her 40s and dressed in black from head to toe, with a lot of leather and fur. &quot;Not anyone can do this job,&quot; says Lela. &quot;You must be born to do it. The guys do the majority of the job, but they need a\u00a0woman on their team. Without a woman nothing could be done.&quot; Lela&apos;s job was to scout the target shops before a job. She would enter in the guise of a\u00a0customer and furtively examine everything she could. On leaving, she would meet with an artist who would sketch the plan of the shop \u2013 down to the nearest centimetre. &quot;If I made a\u00a0mistake, they would be doomed.&quot; The surveillance could take months, not to mention a lot of money. &quot;She had to be dressed in the most expensive clothes and elegant jewellery,&quot; says Mike. &quot;She had to have her own chauffeur. She had to be like Madonna!&quot; It also required frequent &quot;transformations&quot; for her multiple identities: &quot;Hairdressers would come to my house,&quot; recalls Lela. &quot;I&apos;d be sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette, redhead.&quot; Sounds glamorous, I say. &quot;No,&quot; she shoots back, &quot;I hated it! I felt like I would lose my identity. Like a doll who was experimented on.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s because she&apos;s been unable to tell her friends and family about her work, but our conversation is beginning to feel like a therapy session. She tells me that she later had a nervous breakdown. For Mike and his team, once they have stolen the diamonds, their job is done. The selling and carrying of diamonds is too risky: you have to pass them immediately to a prearranged contact, who will take them across borders to buyers, often in Antwerp. They know who in advance will buy what and for how much. The Pink Panthers receive around 15% of the value, the courier 5%. Then there&apos;s the fence, the man who disguises the diamond, &quot;legalises&quot; it and resells it back into the market. Mr Green, a Bosnian Serb, is a very small man, with none of the swagger of the previous crooks I have met. He is fed up with the Panthers getting the glory. &quot;They just do the street work,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Without people like me they&apos;d be nothing.&quot; He estimates that he receives 30-40% of the diamond&apos;s market value. Mr Green tells me that he grew up a peasant woodcutter and joined the JSO, an elite Serb paramilitary unit. Led by Arkan, a notorious henchman of Slobodan Milosevic, the militia was feared across the region. He shows me his maroon beret with pride and I start to feel uncomfortable. &quot;I wasn&apos;t on the frontline,&quot; he says, &quot;I was more in the background.&quot; This does not mean a back-office job. He was, he explains, &quot;responsible for the liquidations of the terrorists&quot;. He seems unrepentant about his murderous past. He is the most frightening man I have met. Everyone who was in the special forces has &quot;business contacts&quot;, he explains. Those contacts stretched to West Africa, the home of many diamond mines, and to Antwerp, where Mr Green later set up a diamond business. His team re-cut the diamonds and create new certificates of origin, stating that each stolen diamond was mined in Sierra Leone recently. The diamond is usually untraceable. The Kimberley Process Certification System was set up in an attempt to stop the blood diamond trade. &quot;In the end it just made it easier for us: we simply forge those certificates of origin and create a &apos;new&apos; diamond.&quot; The diamonds of very high value will usually make it back into the legal trade &quot;on the hands of brides&quot;, he tells me, but the smaller ones have become the currency of the global black market. &quot;You can have a pocketful of diamonds and buy a boatful of cocaine. Now any cash payment over \u00a415,000 has to be traced electronically \u2013 but who controls diamonds? No one.&quot; Mr Green is right about one thing: the Panthers do get the press. They drive like stunt men. Their robberies resemble movies. But they also get the heat, leaving the big money and the wider criminal networks untouched. The Pink Panthers&apos; crime spree in its current guise of hit and runs took off in 2000, then taking full advantage of the new systems in the diamond trade. And while they could exploit the soft borders of Europe and their own countries&apos; corruption, the Panthers seemed untouchable for a while. It was only when various European police forces, notably in Monaco, Switzerland and France, connected that the Panthers were first thwarted. In 2007 Interpol created the Pink Panther Working Group. For the first time global police forces were able to share and spread their information. The spectacular Dubai robbery of 2007 was one of their first successful cases. The Wafi Mall heist would have been perfect, but for one mistake: when they burned the getaway cars someone forgot to open a\u00a0window. No oxygen means the fire can&apos;t rage as it should and so Dubai police managed to retrieve a good deal of DNA evidence. With the help of Interpol the DNA was traced to Dusko Poznan, a 30-year-old Bosnian and Milan Lepoja, from Montenegro. Both were wanted for heists in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2008 Poznan was caught after a car crash in Monaco, and Ljepoja after a dramatic police chase on the borders of France and Switzerland. Both are now serving sentences in Liechtenstein and awaiting trial for the Wafi Mall heist. The woman who drove the second car is still at large. The unusual level of cooperation from the police forces, which has coincided with a\u00a0political period of cooperation from the Balkans itself, has begun to have an impact. Since 2007, 189 Panthers have been arrested \u2013 59 were caught last year. With Montenegro and Serbia keen to join the EU, it&apos;s no longer safe back home. &quot;It&apos;s much more dangerous,&quot; says Mike. &quot;The police know all the tricks. We live much quieter lives now.&quot; Mike and Lela have both retired. When I went to find Novak again, he had been arrested. And as the more experienced thieves cut their losses and return to the quiet life, police have identified a new generation of thieves taking over. They have none of precision or care associated with the older Panthers. Detective Inspector Jan Glassey of the Swiss Police Intelligence showed me CCTV from a\u00a0recent robbery in Geneva. The thieves enter with much more violence, they don&apos;t have bags, they drop things, they panic and leave their gun on a table. &quot;It is then that accidents happen,&quot; explains Glassey. &quot;That is much more worrying for us.&quot; Indeed the Pink Panthers have now had their first shooting: a policeman was wounded during a chase in Greece last year. Two men and a woman had been surveilling the jewellery store they planned to rob, but the wigs they were wearing aroused the suspicion of a\u00a0police patrol, who stopped them for questioning. They fled the scene, shooting and injuring an officer, and all three were later caught (although the female accomplice \u2013 who turned out to be a former national basketball player \u2013 managed to break out of prison and is still on the run). You wonder what Mike and Lela would make of it \u2013 getting found out because your wigs aren&apos;t convincing enough. The fact that the thieves were not even caught on the job, but a mere recce, suggests that standards are slipping. But as long as Mr Green and his associates are able to pass stolen diamonds off as new, there will remain a currency in demand throughout the criminal world. And somehow, somewhere, people will be trying to get their hands on them.

He won his seventh race of the season by over 32 seconds as fireworks and plumes of multi-coloured smoke illuminated the Marina Bay circuit. No one else, it seemed, had a chance. Next came next year&apos;s Ferrari pair, Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen. Jenson Button appeared to have a chance of third place. It would have been McLaren&apos;s first podium position of the season and the British driver&apos;s 50th. But he was overtaken by Raikkonen a few laps from the end and then the British driver&apos;s tyres suffered. This is the longest and hottest grand prix of them all. But nothing, it seems, can stop the champion \u2013 not even the introduction of a safety car when Daniel Ricciardo, the Toro Rosso driver who will partner Vettel next season, crashed on turn 18 shortly before the halfway stage . Vettel was leading by 10 seconds at the time. But after the safety car eventually came in \u2013 it seemed to enjoy itself for a little too long under the 1,500 artificial lights in F1&apos;s only night race \u2013 the German immediately pulled out another two seconds on the first lap following the restart, and after nine laps he had extended his advantage to 20.4sec. Nico Rosberg got off to a terrific start when the race got under way, sliding past Vettel on the inside but the Red Bull driver soon retried his position. The most spectacular action on the opening lap, however, came from Alonso, who improved from seventh to third place. Vettel, though, soon looked unbeatable. By the end of the second lap he had pulled out a lead of 4.1sec and that had become seven seconds after six laps. That opening skirmish with Rosberg was the only trouble he had all afternoon.

For his exploits during the second world war he was appointed OBE, and after it he led the abortive communist campaign to take over Malaya. Chin was the last of the major guerrilla commanders who fought colonialism in Asia after 1945, a group including Sukarno in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia and Aung San in Burma. When Malaya gained independence from Britain in 1957, and six years later merged into today&apos;s Malaysia, Chin continued his struggle for communist control of the new state from exile until a peace agreement was signed in 1989. At this point the Malaysian government flatly refused to allow him to return, a ban which has been extended to his remains. Chin Peng (his nom de guerre) is said to have been born in 1924 in the Malayan state of Perak. His birth name was Ong Boon Hua and his father was an immigrant from China who set up a bicycle business. He took to politics at the age of 13, joining a new ethnic-Chinese society set up to send aid to China in its fight against Japanese aggression. His first role was to lead anti-Japanese activity at his school. At 16 he became a communist. In 1939 he transferred from his Chinese-language school to a British Methodist one, but left after six months to escape British domination and become a full-time revolutionary. To evade local British authorities he moved to Kuala Lumpur, the Malayan capital, in July 1940. When he attained full membership of the Communist party a year later, he was already serving on a number of party committees in Perak as well as party labour organisations. The Japanese invaded Malaya in December 1941, when he was the junior member of the triumvirate running the Perak state committee. His two senior colleagues were arrested by the Japanese early in 1943, leaving Chin in charge. He went back to Kuala Lumpur in a bid to contact the CP central committee, which appointed a new state secretary for Perak in his place \u2013 but the new man was arrested as well, leaving Chin in charge at the age of 19. It was down to him to make contact with a British commando unit operating in Perak in September 1943. Japan was now the enemy and Chin adopted the view that my enemy&apos;s enemy is my friend; but the easy defeat of the British in Malaya, culminating in their worst-ever surrender in Singapore in February 1942, had convinced him that they could be driven out in their turn. For his dangerous work for British forces he was not only appointed OBE (later rescinded), but received two mentions in dispatches. When Lai Tek, secretary general of the Malayan CP, was unmasked as a double agent for the Japanese and the British, Chin was elected to replace him: he was the senior survivor of the party leadership after Lai had betrayed it to the Japanese. He was now 20. After the Japanese defeat in August 1945, the British colonial administration returned and Chin began plotting against it. A state of emergency was declared in June 1948 after the murders of three European planters, allegedly by Malayan CP members. Chin denied foreknowledge but the party was banned, and thousands of British servicemen fought his guerrillas in the jungle. Peace talks at Baling, near the border with Thailand, in the final days of 1955 foundered on the legal recognition of the Malayan CP and an amnesty for insurgents, and fighting continued. Uniquely, the harsh British counter-insurgency campaign prevailed and by 1960 Chin withdrew, first to Thailand and at the end of the year to Beijing. The subsequent &quot;confrontation&quot; by Indonesia against the new state and local British forces also failed and was abandoned in 1966. Urged on by the communist Chinese under Mao Zedong, Chin kept up the campaign against independent Malaya and then Malaysia, in which many thousands died. In 1970 and after, the guerrilla bases in Thailand succumbed to murderous factionalism and paranoia, with a succession of spy trials and executions over which the distant Chin in Beijing could not achieve control. The 1989 peace agreement included a provision for Chin and his comrades to return to his native country, which was never honoured. He went into exile in southern Thailand, travelling to Singapore to lecture at the university. His application in 2000 to return was rejected by the Malaysian high court after five years; his appeal failed in 2008, on the grounds that he was unable to prove his citizenship through documents long lost. Chin died in a Bangkok hospital on the 50th anniversary of the creation of Malaysia. His wife Khoon Wah predeceased him; they had two sons. \u2022 Chin Peng (Ong Boon Hua), political activist and guerrilla leader, born 21 October 1924; died 16 September 2013 \u2022 This obituary was amended on 30 September 2013.

We know it exists. We have a hazy sense of the whys and hows, and the grim percolation of its poison. Only the boundless verve of the fix staggers us now. As well as the sheer weight of numbers. Look at the ledger of recent miscreants. Stephen Lee, the Billy Bunter of the baize, used to deliberate over long pots and plants the way he might over grub and tuck; now he faces a lifetime ban for multiple cases of match-fixing in what authorities described as the &quot;worst case of snooker corruption we&apos;ve ever seen&quot;. Shantha Sreesanth, the Indian pace bowler with a punkish you-looking-at-me? attitude, was banned for life for spot-fixing in the Indian Premier League \u2013 the same punishment 14 El Salvadorian footballers received for match-fixing. Meanwhile last week the coach and several players of the Australian football team Southern Stars were arrested for allegedly fixing five games, and in Singapore police arrested 14 people accused of being involved in a global match-fixing network, including Dan Tan Seet Eng, the gang&apos;s Keyser S\u00f6ze. All this in under a fortnight. And remember, these are only the incidents we are aware of: Sportradar, which monitors betting markets for Uefa among others, fears that 10 football games a week in Europe are tainted. We know that match-fixing, sport&apos;s great super bug, thrives in certain environments; such as when athletes&apos; wages are measly or unpaid and regulation and societal norms are weak. The lower echelons of Australian football, for instance, proved an open goal for fixers because the standard is low \u2013 along with players&apos; wages \u2013 and yet it attracts extraordinary interest from China, where gambling is illegal and betting patterns can&apos;t be tracked. &quot;Australia is very appealing to the Asian market because of the timing of the matches,&quot; explains David Forrest, an economist at the University of Salford. &quot;Friday night is a big gambling night in China. And when is the next football? The noon kick-offs in Australia.&quot; But it is also perhaps worth investigating whether genetics \u2013 nature as well as nurture \u2013 might occasionally play a part too. The starting point for this tentative theory is that academics have shown that successful athletes are risk-lovers, a trait largely beneficial on the field of play. One major study by Frank Sulloway and Richard Zweigenhaft in 2010 analysed the performance of 700 brothers who played major league baseball. It found younger siblings were far more likely to take risks and be successful at stealing bases than their older ones, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 they were also &quot;significantly superior in overall batting success&quot;. But while risk-love is often good for an athlete on the pitch, it can be harmful off it. Unfortunately, there are no figures for the percentage of British athletes addicted to gambling (0.7% of the UK population is, according to the Gambling Commission ), but the Sporting Chance clinic confirms that cases of players with serious gambling addictions are &quot;far more prevalent&quot; than a decade ago and account for a higher percentage than any other vice. That comes as little surprise. Professional sport is no longer a boozy oasis where the night-before bender and half-time snifter is indulged. Players exist in a bubble, they have piles of free time and cash, and gambling doesn&apos;t affect their physical abilities. But perhaps it also goes a little deeper than that. The British researcher John Coates has linked riskiness in part to high and fluctuating testosterone. As David Epstein, the author of The Sports Gene, points out: &quot;Events on the field cause testosterone fluctuations, so you might expect athletes to be like day traders who, when they win at things, become increasingly less risk-averse.&quot; Epstein also points out that some research shows high rates of Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among athletes \u2013 and ADHD is associated with impulsivity, as is gambling. Some people steer easily towards addiction, too. The Sporting Chance clinic treats many players &quot;who crave a similar adrenaline buzz to matches and so gamble large sums of money&quot;. Does this mean that many athletes will tread the darkening path from gambling to match-fixing? Of course not. But we should be aware that they might be susceptible, and educate them of the dangers. Certainly Forrest believes there is a link. &quot;Gambling addiction makes players vulnerable,&quot; he says. &quot;Gangs are always looking for people who might take the money. And if someone gets into financial trouble because they are gambling they are ripe for the plucking.&quot; The case of Tim Donaghy, the NBA referee who accrued huge gambling debts and paid them off by playing points spreads on games he officiated, is an extreme example of what can happen. Lee, too, faced county court judgments for unpaid bills despite earning \u00a3200,000 in 2011-12. No wonder Forrest suspects that last week&apos;s arrests in Singapore are unlikely to change much. &quot;Football \u2013 like other sports \u2013 won&apos;t be safe for long,&quot; Forrest says. &quot;Just as it is with drugs, if you knock out a gang another one will fill the vacuum because there is considerable money to be made easily in fixing sport.&quot; And some athletes, for a great variety of reasons, will always be susceptible."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/23/rihanna-instagram-pic-slow-loris", "sentences": ["&quot;But the shows still happen.&quot; After a weekend spent Instagramming photos of herself on a boat in a bikini, and then performing live in Singapore at the Formula One Grand Prix tournament, Rihanna headed to Australia and New Zealand to continue her tour."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-23T10:24:20Z", "title": "Rihanna's Instagram pic with slow loris prompts police raid", "tags": ["Wildlife", "Thailand", "Rihanna", "Music", "Environment", "World news"], "article": "Thai police have arrested two people on suspicion of attempting to sell endangered wildlife after pop star Rihanna tweeted a photograph of herself clutching a protected primate on the resort island of Phuket.

Along with elephants and orang-utans, however, the loris is often peddled by touts as a photo opportunity for tourists.

The company&apos;s share price jumped more than 5% to $492 in response, adding $4bn to its value in minutes - though it remains well below its all-year high of $543 from January. The figures are nearly double the record figure of five million in 2012, when it introduced the iPhone 5. Though the company did not release a sales breakdown between the new iPhone 5s - which incorporates a fingerprint reader - and the cheaper, and coloured, 5c, data from Mixpanel, a mobile analytics company, suggests the breakdown was 2:1 in favour of the pricier devices. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the new &quot;gold&quot; iPhone 5s - deemed ugly by some - was the most popular model. Tim Cook, Apple&apos;s chief executive who under Steve Jobs drove the operational side of the business - and built up its supply systems so that it could cope with colossal spikes in demand like the weekend&apos;s - expressed his delight. &quot;The demand for the new iPhones has been incredible, and while we&apos;ve sold out of our initial supply of iPhone 5s, stores continue to receive new iPhone shipments regularly,&quot; Cook said in a statement. &quot;We appreciate everyone&apos;s patience and are working hard to build enough new iPhones for everyone.&quot; The sales figures put the struggles of rival phone makers Nokia and BlackBerry into sharp focus. The value of iPhones sold was calculated at more than the enterprise value - the price minus cash - of Nokia&apos;s handset business, sold to Microsoft for \u20ac5.4bn earlier in September. And BlackBerry, which is preparing to formally announce a $1bn loss on Friday, managed to ship only 3.7m phones in the past three months. The sales come despite a German hacker group claiming to have fooled the fingerprint reader on the iPhone 5s with a scanned version of a fingerprint captured from glass, and reports of security vulnerabilities on some features. Apple also said that its new iOS 7 software has been installed on 200m devices since its launch last Wednesday - which it called &quot;the fastest software upgrade in history&quot;. That means it may be only a few days away from reaching as many users as Google&apos;s Android 4.1.x, which has 287m users.  The higher figure is in part due to the new phones going on sale in many more territories than in 2012 and preceding years. The phones were available in the US, Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, Singapore and the UK - whereas in 2012 the list did not include China and Puerto Rico. China alone is reckoned to have contributed 3m sales. In 2011, the then-new iPhone 4S sold 4m in US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the UK. &quot;It&apos;s an impressive opening weekend, but unsurprising because older models [were] still selling well immediately prior to the launch,&quot; said Ian Fogg of IHS. &quot;But a great logistical achievement.&quot; Apple&apos;s gigantic sales figure also turns a spotlight on Samsung, whose launch of its Galaxy S4 in spring. The South Korean company said that it sold 10m of the new phones after 28 days - and 20m after two months - but soon afterwards financial analysts marked down its stock because they felt the sales were slow, and indicated that the top end of the smartphone business, which the S4 targets, was tapped out. That in turn led to renewed focus on Apple&apos;s strategy, and speculation that the cheaper 5c would have to be priced at around $400 SIM-free in order to compete in the middle market. But Apple ignored that trend and priced the cheaper 5c at $549 for an unlocked handset."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/23/mark-webber-red-bull-formula-one", "sentences": ["In 12 years as a grand prix driver the 37-year-old Australian has always been the most warm and human of competitors in a cold and often vicious business, so it was hardly surprising that last weekend, after the Singapore Grand Prix, he hitched a lift back to the pits on the Ferrari of his friend, Fernando Alonso, or that he has since received a 10-place grid punishment at the next race in Korea.", "Sebastian Vettel won in Singapore, to virtually seal his fourth successive drivers&apos; title, but he was booed on the podium for the third consecutive race as his ruthless decision-making has not won him the affection which envelops his Red Bull team-mate."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-23T18:19:43Z", "title": "Mark Webber: 'I've had some great highs and some hard lows in F1'", "tags": ["Mark Webber", "Red Bull", "Formula One 2013", "Formula One", "Motor sport"], "article": "I feel good about it, mate,&quot; Mark Webber says as his admirable Formula One career shrinks to just six remaining races.

I would never have imagined me ending up having raced in over 200 grands prix with some pretty special wins on the big stage \u2013 toe-to-toe fighting all the way. I&apos;ve got nine wins and 38 podiums. And I&apos;ve never missed a race. I&apos;ve never missed a test session. I&apos;ve never missed an hour in the car.&quot; At the start of the 2009 season, just 11 weeks after he fractured his right leg in a break almost as bad as that which changed the football career of Eduardo da Silva forever, Webber should have used crutches to reach the car on the grid \u2013 but he knew &quot;the messaging would&apos;ve been all wrong&quot;. Surely there must have been some test sessions or races he was close to missing? &quot;I had food poisoning in one race but I still finished it \u2013 Fuji in &apos;07. I&apos;ve also competed with fractured ribs \u2026&quot; Webber shrugs but he&apos;s more than just a hard-boiled Aussie bloke who can grit his teeth and growl about commitment and determination. He has carved out an extraordinary life from a distinctly unpromising start. &quot;The numbers speak for themselves. Only three drivers from Australia have ever won a grand prix in 60 years [Jack Brabham and Alan Jones are the others]. So it&apos;s not a particularly easy category for us to crack. I&apos;ve hopefully left a legacy for other Aussies \u2026&quot; In late June Webber announced his decision to retire from Formula One and join Porsche next year, when he will race sports cars in the FIA World Endurance Championship. He could not disguise his satisfaction when Red Bull, who appeared startled by his choice, eventually appointed another Australian, Daniel Ricciardo, as his replacement. &quot;Exactly. Daniel&apos;s on his way now \u2026&quot; Webber&apos;s own route to the peak of F1 was very different to Ricciardo who, at 24, will drive for the grid&apos;s dominant team. &quot;When I first came to England in the mid-1990s,&quot; Webber says, as he recalls trying to break into Formula Ford and then Formula Three, &quot;I stayed in this box room in Hainault [in north east London]. It was winter and you&apos;ve got condensation on the inside of the window. It was hard. At the track the other drivers rocked up in fancy cars and you&apos;re in your B-reg Fiesta. But that&apos;s petrol for your fire.&quot; During those earliest days in his Hainault bedsit, which he shared with his long-term partner Ann Neal, and her then baby son, Luke, did he question his ability to reach Formula One? &quot;I was very doubtful. The first two years in England were on a shoestring. I was getting \u00a343 a day. Our first rent was \u00a3550 a month which, bloody hell, was a lot of money. Annie was working hard, but she had Luke as well. Sometimes the groceries were a challenge for the three of us. It was very tight. &quot;I was so naive. I would go from Hainault station and it was four stops on the tube to the gym. And I didn&apos;t have a clue what to do. You&apos;re a monkey with a machine gun. Every day you&apos;re trying to teach yourself by doing something different. That tenacity and drive helps when you&apos;re competing professionally because that&apos;s when people tell you if you&apos;re doing a shit job. You know what it&apos;s like at the top end of professional sport. People change \u2013 but I&apos;ve been lucky. I&apos;ve had the same people around me since day one. We&apos;ve had some great highs, some hard lows.&quot; It took Webber 131 races, and eight years of trying, before he won his first grand prix in Germany in 2009. &quot;That first win was probably the sweetest,&quot; he says with a grin, &quot;because of the way I won it, from pole, and after a drive-through penalty. To drive away from Seb and win by 30 seconds, in his backyard, was a nice way to get my first win.&quot; There have been so many bitter spats with Vettel, starting in Japan in 2007 when the young German drove Webber off the track while at Toro Rosso. The Australian was furious because, despite vomiting inside his helmet during the race, he was lying second to Lewis Hamilton. &quot;It&apos;s kids,&quot; he said, &quot;they fuck it all up.&quot; As team-mates the altercations intensified \u2013 particularly when Red Bull favoured Vettel. Just before qualifying for the British Grand Prix in 2010, the upgraded front wing of Webber&apos;s car had been given to Vettel. Webber still went on to win the race the following day, which, as he said dryly, was &quot;not bad for a No2 driver&quot;. Earlier this season, in Malaysia, Vettel flagrantly ignored team orders and overtook Webber to win the race. &quot;2010 was harder because there was a lot more at stake then. That was difficult to swallow. You put so much into it and you get half a brick put into your backpack. In Malaysia, during those last 15 laps, I did a lot of thinking as to how the whole scenario had got to that point. I wasn&apos;t surprised by what Seb did, but just how it had reached that point.&quot; Vettel expressed contrition after the race but at the next grand prix, in Shanghai, he implied he would do it all again. His attitude might be one of the reasons he keeps being booed. &quot;I suppose some of the private discussions that Sebastian and I have had since then have been a bit disappointing,&quot; Webber says. &quot;Forget the track stuff. We&apos;ve had some private discussions and we weren&apos;t super-happy with how they went and how we felt about each other. It&apos;s tested the relationship to the maximum.&quot; Has the atmosphere improved since Webber announced that he was leaving Formula One? &quot;Not really. We&apos;re just going through the professional situation because you&apos;ve got a lot of people busting their balls for you \u2013 the guys working on the car.&quot; Does the 2010 championship still eat away at him \u2013 when he led Vettel going into the final race only for the German to win his first title and Webber to finish third? &quot;Yeah. In a way I suppose it would&apos;ve been better not to have been so close. But I look back at so many races that year of which I was proud. It was a pretty phenomenal year and no one would have predicted that the guy who ended up winning it hadn&apos;t led all year. But you always want more.&quot; The only decision he would change, if he could, &quot;would be to have gone to Renault rather than Williams [in 2005]. Renault hadn&apos;t won a race but soon after that they ran it. They were like the Red Bull of the time. I would&apos;ve been winning earlier and had Fernando [Alonso] as a team-mate. So I had to rebuild myself and that took a bit of juice out of me. The fractured leg took more juice out of me in 2008. So I had a couple of really solid uppercuts which took the wind out of me. I also started late, although 24 is probably the right age. Look at [Nigel] Mansell and [Mika] Hakkinen. Those guys didn&apos;t start until then. That was normal. You didn&apos;t get near a top car. Now, with simulators, the kids are coming in so fast. We&apos;ve got so many guys on the grid who probably shouldn&apos;t be there.&quot; Has nostalgia taken hold as he races tracks like Spa and Monza and Silverstone for the last time? &quot;I think Melbourne and Monte Carlo were really the two where I felt that. I was pissed off I didn&apos;t get to the podium in Melbourne as it&apos;s the only race where I&apos;ve never reached the podium \u2013 and it&apos;s my home GP. It&apos;s also where I had my first ever F1 race.&quot; Webber finished fifth in 2002 and won those hard-earned points in a struggling Minardi. &quot;Exactly. I must&apos;ve used up all my Aussie credits then.&quot; Did he know that this would be his last season when he sat on the grid in Melbourne this year? &quot;Yeah. I took all the Aussie and English journalists out to dinner so I knew it was my last race in Melbourne. I think I&apos;ll have another moment like that in Brazil [the season finale on 24 November].&quot; Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal, was taken aback when he heard about Webber&apos;s decision just before Porsche confirmed that he had signed a contract to join them. &quot;My communication with Dietrich [Mateschitz, Red Bull&apos;s owner] was always open and very strong,&quot; Webber says. &quot;That was important. I never asked him not to say anything, it was up to him how he dealt with that. We&apos;d always had a good relationship and I told him I wanted to stop even if he said there was always a seat for me. Once he&apos;d been informed, then it was good for me and Porsche to get the announcement out nice and cleanly. &quot;I still feel hungry to finish off the year well but I&apos;m also hungry for the next stage of my career. I&apos;ve spoken to a few sportsmen, like Pat Rafter, who didn&apos;t get their retirement right. You can&apos;t hang on if the fire in the belly is dropping. The last few years I&apos;ve felt it dropping slightly. But the move to Porsche will relight the old fire. Moving into a new work environment, with a different team, will be good.&quot; Webber&apos;s continuing professionalism is obvious as, during a day at GEOX, the shoe company who are one of Red Bull&apos;s joint sponsors, he cheerfully completes his promotional duties at their Oxford Street store. There is much about Formula One that Webber won&apos;t miss, but his familiar enthusiasm is obvious. &quot;I&apos;ll miss working with Adrian Newey,&quot; he says of Red Bull&apos;s brilliant designer who has been the key figure in the team&apos;s success for the past four years. &quot;Adrian is phenomenal and when I&apos;m in a rocking chair at 75 I&apos;ll still remember how awesome it was working with him. I&apos;ll also just miss driving the car and being out there on your own, racing. But the decision is made and, mate, it&apos;s the right decision.&quot; GEOX supply all shoes worn by the Red Bull racing team.

In Italy I have been booed on the podium, so that happens because it&apos;s Ferrari&apos;s back yard. &quot;But in Singapore? It&apos;s a surprise. Michael Schumacher got booed because he did things people did not like, but Seb&apos;s not really done that, so it&apos;s strange to hear it.&quot; It was Vettel&apos;s third straight win for Red Bull, his seventh of the season and his third in as many races in Singapore. It&apos;s gives him a commanding 60-point lead over Fernando Alonso with six races remaining. Hamilton said: &quot;No one should ever be booed or put down for their success, however hard or easy it&apos;s been for them to get where they are. It is such a negative thing, especially when someone has worked so hard to be successful. &quot;Maybe when Fernando and I were team-mates [at McLaren in 2007] he had it at Silverstone. And I might have got it in Barcelona when I beat him that year. I might have had it in Italy [when he won there in 2012]. But I&apos;ve not noticed it ever before.&quot; The booing was condemned by the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, on Sunday night. Vettel, who received similar treatment at Silverstone and Monza earlier in the year, said of the people who jeered him: &quot;They are on a tour, they come to every race. Fortunately we keep winning so they&apos;ve got a reason to boo, but it is not nice. &quot;If you look around the grandstands most of the fans are dressed in red.

Ward believes Todt has breached not only the FIA&apos;s Code of Ethics, but also the body&apos;s statutes and internal regulations. Ward had already claimed that Todt has used FIA resources to attend meetings with member clubs during which they were asked to sign formal written commitments to support the Frenchman&apos;s re-election bid in the form of &apos;support agreements&apos;. With the Ethics Committee investigating, Ward said: &quot;I think at the very least it would be in the best interest of the FIA if all the support letters signed before 6 September now be revoked.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/24/oscars-2014-grandmaster-wong-kar-wai", "sentences": ["The Grandmaster joins the likes of Gloria (from Chile), Renoir (France), Walesa (Poland), Cannes Camera d&apos;Or winner Ilo Ilo (Singapore) and Wadjda (Saudi Arabia) in the first round of Oscar submissions."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-24T08:00:00Z", "title": "Wong Kar-wai's The Grandmaster picked as Hong Kong's Oscar entry", "tags": ["The Grandmaster", "Wong Kar-Wai", "Film", "Hong Kong", "Oscars", "Oscars 2014", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Wong Kar-wai&apos;s period martial arts epic The Grandmaster has become the latest film to be put forward for the Academy awards best foreign language long list, as it received the nod from Hong Kong&apos;s Federation of Motion Film Producers.

I was calling three technologists from Stockholm&apos;s\u00a0Royal Institute of Technology, whom I had first met just days before. We decided to start the world\u2019s first cloud-based 3D scanning service.\u00a0 The 3D revolution will change the world, but it requires access both to 3D printers and to 3D models for printing. But those 3D models are still too difficult to create - and that is what Volumental is here to change, from one of the top startup hotspots in the world.\u00a0      Caroline Walerud of 3D scanning startup Volumental. Photo by&nbsp;stockholminnovation&nbsp;on&nbsp;Flickr.&nbsp;All rights reserved     Welcome to Stockholm, birthplace of Mojang\u00a0and Spotify. We\u2019re an educated, early-adopter people, often described as trendy Germans who speak great English. We\u2019re tech-savvy and, with the help of a supportive ecosystem, our startups quickly go global. Volumental&apos;s first customer, for example, was Australian.\u00a0 Still, we are the land of the &apos;safety junkies&apos;, as described by the Swedish psychiatrist\u00a0David Eberhard. It pains me to write that Swedes are afraid of failure, but we are. Like it or not, successful ventures are not built in the lab; they evolve through repeated market testing. In that evolution, failure is natural and weeds out bad ideas. Failure should welcome feedback.\u00a0 Unfortunately even the government is afraid of failure, despite most early capital coming from public institutions with book-long applications. Early grants are earmarked for consultants, pushing the focus away from sales and towards administration and meticulous business planning.\u00a0          An introduction to Volumental     The Swedish innovation agency Vinnova\u00a0is doing a great job changing that approach, but they can&apos;t do it alone. Private funding cannot fill this gap: due to suffocating tax laws on investment\u00a0Sweden has few business angels, and even venture capitalists are safety junkies in their own way. Because of this, Volumental is focusing on international funding sources, such as our Kickstarter campaign\u00a0that went live this summer and exceeded its fundraising target.\u00a0 How do startups compete with big business? That safety dependency means we fight for magical people, but they prefer stability. Instead of high salaries, we want to incentivise with shares and stock options, but tax regulation made this almost impossible to set up. Sweden must realise that today we are fighting for the rising stars in a global market, losing start-ups to the speedier Silicon Valley. In that 3am call, I took the leap into Volumental. It was the first of many late nights when we were only a team of techies with a cool idea, months of hard work with no pay and constantly firefighting problems.\u00a0 We\u2019re still learning from our failures, now with customers, funding and a team of eleven, and getting closer to success. This is part of Stockholm - a capital iterating on its failures, and getting better every time.  Caroline Walerud, chief executive and co-founder of Volumental  Klarna: The biggest mobile startup you&apos;ve never heard of Klarna tells Jemima Kiss why its payment system takes the pain out of buying on mobile, and why it is also sitting on a powerful big data play \u2022 One-click mobile payments tool \u2022 Used for 30% of Sweden&apos;s ecommerce transactions \u2022 Pay later option that consolidates bills across multiple retailers  Buy something using Klarna on any retail site and you&apos;ll immediately notice the difference: a clean, minimised login that can be done in one click, and you can choose to pay immediately using Visa, Mastercard or online banking \u2013 or choose to pay next month. Director of product management Ted Bowman says complex logins, repeating information and paying before goods arrive were all points of pain that Klarna is trying to fix.\u00a0 &quot;We think we are the first product that makes people want to buy on mobile,&quot; he adds. &quot;No one has totally cracked it but we&apos;re very focused on mobile conversions.&quot;     Klarna's mobile checkout service. Photograph: Klarna    Bowman\u00a0explains how the fiddly process of buying online is easily disrupted \u2013 the doorbell rings, the kids kick off, you can&apos;t find your purse \u2013 so the simpler to process, the more likely you are to complete the transaction. And if you buy using Klarna from multiple sites, you can pay the whole bill together once each month. How can Klarna offer credit to consumers without taking on too much risk? The answer, says Bowman, is by employing far more sophisticated and comprehensive ways of tracking a user&apos;s creditworthiness. &quot;We think we have the best risk assessment in the world, looking at 142 different factors on a transaction-by-transaction basis, from social media and time of day and to data on individual things you have bought. If you suddenly go online and buy five iPads shipping to Romania at 5am, we&apos;ll flag that up.&quot;     Ted Bowman, Klarna's director of product management. Photograph: Klarna    The front end, meanwhile, combines a simple interface with the idea of making Klarna the &apos;want&apos; button on retail sites. The focus is on being part of a physical goods delivery system - there is no interest in being used to buy virtual goods, which have a less tangible value. One click checkout is done using your email address or phone number, and the process uses information from previous orders or a third party provider to prefill the rest of your details.\u00a0 How ethical is it to gather this kind of fine grain information about consumers and use it against them in this way? &quot;The German authorities are very particular about the data we use to make credit decisions,&quot; says comms VP Claes Tellman, who not coincidentally has a background in the risk assessment-heavy gambling industry. &quot;Debts are growing for younger people, but debts on Klarma have gone down to 0.5%. We don&apos;t let debtors in.&quot; Are they challenging PayPal? &quot;We&apos;d be happy to have the level of success they have had in the US but we do think there is room for improvement,&quot; says product manager Phil Mikal of the eight countries in which Klaran operates. &quot;Our product is not the same country to country, and we learn through the pain and success of each unique product.&quot; In Sweden, the benefits are a highly educated workforce with a way of working that is very focused on solutions to problems, he explains. Swedish companies tend to be less hierarchical, so junior staff are more free to questions managers.\u00a0     Stockholm's archipelago.&nbsp;Photograph: Ville Hyv&ouml;nen/flickr    Klarna&apos;s story is a familiar one of tenacious founders in their early 20s with a good idea. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Victor Jacobsson and Niklas Adalberth have had a meteoric rise from meeting at Burger King, to a level of ubiquity in Sweden on a par with cash or credit cards, where Klarna accounts for 30% of all ecommerce transactions. Klarna&apos;s slick Stockholm offices are home to most of its 800 staff, backed by Sequoia, General Atlantic, Digital Sky, Oresund and by veteran Swedish investor Jane Walerud \u2013 mother of Volumental founder Caroline \u2013 who pitched in the first $80,000 back in 2005.\u00a0 There&apos;s an intensity and growth in Sweden that echoes the success of Silicon Valley, but a particularly Swedish thought leadership, commercial polish and highly skilled workforce.\u00a0     Klarna's new office, as modelled in Lego. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    Klarna is being used by 15,000 merchants, starting to expand from its large user base in Sweden, and has been used by 20 million individual consumers for 60m transactions since launch. It processed \u20ac2bn in transaction volumes for 2012 with an average spend of \u20ac40, and is profitable with &quot;a couple of hundred million in revenues&quot; since launch.\u00a0 As well as breaking new markets, Klarna is also looking at its goldmine of real-time retail data; a powerful chunk of market insight especially at peaks such as Christmas. Compare that to market insight at the startup Editd, which mines fashion sector data from retail and trend watching sites to inform retailers designs, stock and price points and you can see how powerful, though sensitive, this cross-industry could be. &quot;That would have to be rolled out in a universally accepted way because sharing data between merchants is controversial. We&apos;re not yet at a point where we could release that as a product, but we are looking at that on our roadmap.&quot;  Tictail: the future of selling online Tictail&apos;s sleek, simple and brilliant plan is to be the Tumblr of online stores \u2013 and with an API to match.

But how can the service move into the mainstream? Jemima Kiss speaks to Ian Robbins on Spotify&apos;s product development team for music discovery \u2022 Sweden&apos;s most famous startup wants a more mainstream consumer audience \u2022 Web version and stickier recommendations designed for more plays \u2022 Artist pages to be pushed as promotional tools     Spotify's lobby at its Stockholm HQ. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    Music discovery has been top of Spotify users&apos; request list since, arguably, the service began. The site offers two different experiences, explains Ian Robbins from the product development team; the lean forward user who knows exactly what she wants to listen to and isn&apos;t daunted by that blank search box; and the lean back user, who wants a more serendipitous experience akin to radio.\u00a0 It&apos;s that leanback experience that had been missing until the discovery feature for the web app launched in April on trial and then more broadly in May this year. Crucially, discovery is a feature designed to pull in and keep new users, making the service more sticky and accessible \u2013 and mainstream. &quot;Personalisation is a powerful experience and infectious,&quot; said Robbins. &quot;When you come into the product from the first day as a new user, it shows what you&apos;re listening to, what might interest you and tells you that if you follow artists and bands the experience will become even more personalised.&quot;\u00a0     Collaborative workspace at Spotify. Photo: Jemima Kiss    Users who browse more play more music, he said, pointing to user data, so the aim is to encourage more playlists and more plays. He described more &quot;affection&quot; for Spotify itself once those kind of discoveries have been unlocked. This desire to appeal to a mainstream music fan informs the way that Spotify rolls out new products; rather than use an elite group of Spotify obsessives or musos to test new features, the site now rolls out to 1% of all users, then 2%, then 5% and then site-wide. Feedback is then far more relevant for the majority of users. Spotify admits to being caught out by the speed at which users are moving to mobile platforms. &quot;It makes &apos;platformisation&apos; even more important. Everything is now mobile first,&quot; says Robbins. &quot;That isn&apos;t the priority for all companies \u2013 it depends what the product or service is, and who the user base is.&quot;\u00a0 iPhone users, for Spotify, are slightly more geeky, but the rocketing number of Android users \u2013 and more mainstream users \u2013 means it is now as important to develop for.\u00a0 The three core products are now iPad, iPhone and web app, the latter being a significant step towards reaching a mainstream who might be uncomfortable downloading desktop software.     A Nirvana-themed meeting room at Spotify's HQ. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    There are clever tweaks in discovery; the new preview tool plays with press-and-hold, so click off and the current song continues playing. A little of the touch-and-hold of Vine? The preview is a small clip a certain percentage of the way through the song \u2013 &quot;the magical mean&quot;.\u00a0 Spotify has also ditched the &quot;friend&quot; model in favour of the &quot;follow&quot; model; Robbins describes this as a broader and more relevant term, as users can follow albums as well as artists. Those artist pages can now be customised, giving them a profile to curate and making followers \u2013 their fans \u2013 visible.\u00a0 Making playlists for fans is popular; Daft Punk do this regularly, and the massive success of Get Lucky on Spotify (and everywhere else) has made it the site&apos;s number one track of all time with more than 63m listens. Robbins talks about the acquisition of fellow Swedish playlist company Tunigo in May. &quot;It was already one of our best partners and the traffic stood out last year \u2013 it&apos;s about brilliant curation.&quot; It gave Spotify a market-tested playlist tool, and accelerated its work on music discovery tools.\u00a0 &quot;Phase four is to expand that artists experience to more of a promotional platform,&quot; Robbins says. &quot;That follow model means artists can take advantage of having all those fans, so they could ask followers to log in to share a preview of their new single. We want to create a level of customisation that is measured, so not quite the MySpace side of the spectrum but not the same site for everyone \u2013 developers get tools, and artists get promotion.&quot;  Stockholm soundbites: Johan Jorgensen of FundedByMe Jemima Kiss interviews Johan Jorgensen of\u00a0FundedByMe, a platform that connects investors with entrepreneurs Reading on mobile?

Photograph: /PR    Its runaway success is the Candy Crush saga, a familiar format of addictively rearranging colourful sweets. &quot;We don&apos;t expect every game to reach that level of success, but we are trying to hit-proof the business by launching games on our platform on the web in a smaller, lighter form, then get a sense of the response and embellish the gameplay,&quot; says Knutsson. &quot;We have a higher success rate than most, but many of our games are evergreen. Card games are as popular as ever, and Tetris just as much as it was 20 years ago.&quot; For casual gamers, or people just starting, it&apos;s normal to start with something that feels familiar, even nostalgic, just as new users of Spotify tend to search for the music they loved 20 years ago. The way to engage those users is not by giving them tools to brag about their achievements, but with tools that let friends help each other \u2013 particularly on the infamous level 65 of Candy Crush.\u00a0     King's games had around 92 million daily users, as of June 2013, with Candy Crush its breakout hit. Photograph: /PR    King has offices in London, Stockholm, Hamburg and Bucharest among others. Knutsson said the focus on product and innovation \u2013 perhaps without the bluster and hype of some US social games companies \u2013 has contributed to a stealthy success for this sector; Scandinavian games accounted for five of the top 10 iPhone games at time of writing. It&apos;s often said, but the principle of being humble about success is innate. &quot;I think you have to be careful about believing that success is permanent, that we have to say what the mistakes are and build the right internal culture and manage that success in a good way,&quot; says co-founder Thomas Hartwig. The team develops games quickly \u2013 about three months is typical from conception to launch \u2013 and the focus is on developing game IP, though the ideas that don&apos;t work are just as important in informing game design.     Plans afoot in King's Stockholm office. Photo: Jemima Kiss    It&apos;s easier to grow new territories on mobile, he said, but while there is huge potential in the US and Europe, it&apos;s Asia \u2013 particularly Japan and China \u2013 that would be the grand prize. &quot;There&apos;s intense competition from local players and it&apos;s hard for western companies to grow big. China has a huge market and big studios. The future giants will be Asian \u2013 Tencent has something like 48,000 staff. But Candy Crush has been the number one game in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. The game is general enough that it speaks to a mainstream audience but needs strong marketing channels and partnerships to get into that market.&quot; There are 39 staff at King who work on data analysis, using information on gameplay to inform their new titles. &quot;That work with data combines with intuition and experience to fine tune our games. But longevity is trickier than getting the one hit that explodes. Repeating it is the big challenge, though there is an advantage in being in a segment where the games aren&apos;t really bleeding edge \u2013 the consumers are less fickle, and if you have good relationships with those consumers you can keep them for 10 years.&quot;  Stockholm soundbites:\u00a0Fredrik Espinoza and Magnus Sahlgren of Gavagai Semantic data analysis tool for speech Gavagai\u00a0has multiple applications.

Photo: Jemima Kiss Photograph: /Jemima Kiss    While most of the rest of the newspaper industry was tying itself in knots about the death of print, Norway&apos;s Schibsted was ploughing ahead with diversification. In 2003, Schibsted paid around \u00a320m for blocket.se, a traditional online classifieds site that has become a template for complementary businesses to Schibsted&apos;s media portfolio. With plans to close the printing presses in 2017, the race to online profitability is on. Though &quot;considered reckless&quot; by the media at the time, according to head of growth investments Dan Ouchterlony, Blocket has become Sweden&apos;s biggest classifieds site and profits quickly grew to justify the purchase price; in 2012, EBITDA profit grew 54% year on year to \u00a341m. Schibsted had failed to replicate what Blocket was doing in the early days, and so bought the site instead.\u00a0     Blocket is Sweden's most successful classifieds site.

Schibsted has invested in another seven established classifieds sites, including Willhaben.at in Austria and Coches.net in Spain, as well as 14 earlier stage sites including Mudah\u00a0in Malaysia and Bikhir.ma\u00a0in Morocco. Most are based on the Blocket model, though Richard Sandenskog, a former journalist and the investment manager for Schibsted Growth, says the point is not to make a quick buck out of consumers, but to provide tools that help them make better decisions.\u00a0     Aftonbladet office.

Schibsted&apos;s media properties include Norway&apos;s Aftenpost\u00a0and Verdens Gang, the 20 Minutes brand in France, Spain\u00a0and Switzerland\u00a0and the Swedish national tabloid Aftonbladet. Aftonbladet&apos;s network claimed 4.8 million unique browsers\u00a0for the last week of August 2013 making it one of the busiest sites in Sweden, with Blocket recording 3.3 million. Another principle has been to use unsold inventory on Schibsted&apos;s media sites to promote its own companies \u2013 rather than flogging the space through services like Google who auction to the highest display bidder. TV guides, weather, daily deals, personal finance, insurance and mobile price plans all complement those media sites, said Sandenskog. Schibsted&apos;s sunny open-plan Stockholm offices are buzzing with banks of startup teams, all working on these complementary products.     Schibsted's early-stage startups share its Stockholm office. Photograph: Jemima Kiss    &quot;Journalists don&apos;t think they are in the media business \u2013 they think they are in the content production business, so they don&apos;t get excited about new business models. But the fact that we have this model today shows we are major global players \u2013 the mindset is a more commercialised environment than broadsheets.&quot; Sandenskog said journalism has been addicted to the ad-funded model for 150 years, yet display advertising is just not large enough to support news businesses now. &quot;Management has been doing this long enough to be curious about what could happen if they bet on the internet, and did so even during the financial crisis \u2013 we effectively moved to cannibalise our own business.&quot;\u00a0 But the window of opportunity to develop these consumer-focused web businesses is getting increasingly competitive. Concept clones now take months, not years, to roll out and with increasing activity in China and the ever present US, that competition is global. But that does have some benefit for a Scandinavian company initially insulated against English-language competition by its domestic market. &quot;We&apos;re getting bigger and bigger footprints, and can help startups omit VCs,&quot; said Ouchterlony. &quot;We explain that we can help them scale, and use our firehose of marketing power as well as the experience of our 20 portfolio companies.&quot;\u00a0 &quot;There are hundreds of profitable internet companies - very healthy local investments and transparently profitable.

At the moment, employees are effectively taxed twice on equity, meaning they lose as much as 80% to 90% of the equity value in tax. That makes it much harder for startups to use equity as an incentive to attract new talent \u2013 something that&apos;s standard in the wider tech industry \u2013 so it&apos;s bound to be hugely popular. That said, the Green party won only a 7.3% share of the vote in Sweden&apos;s last election and is very far from being in power, so there is little chance of changing the law unless one of the major parties decide to pick this up. \u2022 &quot;Jantelagen&quot; is somewhere between a social tradition, a cultural mindset and an unspoken characteristic of Scandinavians in which individual success or self-promotion is frowned upon, while humility and shared success is seen as more worthy and valuable. It is often discussed and regularly dismissed, but however realistic, there has unquestionably been a lack of self-promotion and credit for the Swedish startup scene in particular, which punches way above its weight in terms of commercial acumen and talent.\u00a0 \u2022 LA-based tech rabble rouser Tyler Crowley has been living and working in Stockholm this year helping organise Stockholm&apos;s Tech Meetup and motivating entrepreneurs and developers to promote Stockholm&apos;s talent more widely.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways&apos; parent company IAG, said the airport was planning to raise prices by \u00a3600m over five years while cutting spending on facilities. In a strident denunciation of the London airport&apos;s &quot;abusive monopoly&quot;, Walsh said that Heathrow&apos;s boss, Colin Matthews, had been &quot;pathetic&quot; in trying to make a political argument linking higher airport charges to Britain&apos;s need for more overseas investment. With the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) scheduled to rule on the fees that Heathrow can charge airlines, Walsh warned the regulator not to be &quot;hoodwinked&quot; again, and to correct its mistakes of the recent past which Walsh said involved Heathrow being &quot;grossly over-rewarded&quot;. Walsh said Heathrow&apos;s management seemed &quot;incapable of running their business efficiently within a routine cost-control environment&quot;. He added: &quot;What we see is an airport that has too many people; those people are paid too much.&quot; The CAA is due on October 3 to set fees that the airport can charge from 2014. It has proposed raising charges below inflation, at RPI -1.3%, over the next five years \u2013 a level some way below Heathrow&apos;s demands. Airlines led by BA, the airport&apos;s biggest customer, have demanded a real-terms cut of almost 10% after five years in which charges rose by RPI +7.5%. Walsh insisted the CAA was &quot;not being robust enough&quot;. He added: &quot;If the CAA does not take a stronger line on this it will continue to be inefficient and that will be at the expense of passengers.&quot; According to BA&apos;s calculations, increased landing fees will mean every passenger journey costs \u00a37 more than the airline believes is reasonable. Matthews had provoked Walsh&apos;s ire by saying that lower charges gave no incentive for shareholders to invest and that Britain would not be able to attract foreign capital. Heathrow&apos;s major shareholders are the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Singapore and China, as well as a Canadian pension fund and Spanish construction giant Ferrovial. Walsh said: &quot;Passengers are paying more than they should and the benefits of that are going to higher-than-average rewards for the shareholders. &quot;If Colin Matthews is incapable of running the airport and making the investment that&apos;s necessary, and requires an excessive return to justify that investment, then he should be replaced. &quot;If he was the CEO at a listed entity and came out with the statements he&apos;s come out with, I suspect shareholders would take a completely different view because of the impact on the share price.&quot; Walsh feared the regulator was succumbing to external pressure to adjust its proposal in Heathrow&apos;s favour. &quot;It makes London, certainly Heathrow, less competitive than the rest of Europe.&quot; He admitted BA could not leave Heathrow, but vowed to appeal if the CAA did not cut its charges. Heathrow has said that the CAA&apos;s current proposed charges would mean less maintenance of the airport, and the curbing of planned improvements to baggage facilities and other aspects affecting passengers. A Heathrow official said: &quot;We have put forward plans for more than \u00a3400m of cost savings over the next five years. We want to continue the investment that has been improving Heathrow for passengers. &quot;Airlines&apos; proposals for 40% price cuts can&apos;t be achieved without risking under-investment and a return to the out-dated Heathrow of the past.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/24/guardian-weekly-sports-diary", "sentences": ["\u2013 another victory for Sebastian Vettel, this time in Singapore.", "It was the Red Bull driver&apos;s third victory in as many races, his third straight win in Singapore and the 33rd of his career as he extended his lead in the championship to 60 points with six races to go."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-24T13:05:08Z", "title": "Sunderland part company with ketchup hater Di Canio", "tags": [], "article": "There were hearty cheers from Sunderland ketchup retailers after Paolo Di Canio \u2013 to the surprise of absolutely no one apart from rampant egotist Paolo Di Canio \u2013 became the first Premier League manager of the season to lose his job.

Heineken hangover for rugby Nothing gets the pulse racing more than news of bickering between club suits and sports administrators. Thank heavens for rugby union, then, where a major brouhaha is developing between the leading English and French clubs and the International Rugby Board. The clubs are adamant that nothing can be done to stop them replacing the Heineken Cup with a tournament that has been imaginatively called the Rugby Champions Cup (a bit of advice: &quot;league&quot; sounds better) even though the three Celtic unions and Italy, in fierce opposition to the plans, want Premiership Rugby and the Ligue Nationale de Rugby to kick their brainchild into touch.

This really betrays the naive elitism and conservative thinking of some labour economists. Just because occupations like policing and nursing used apprenticeship models of training 50 years ago does not mean that such models are still appropriate. Both occupations now need sophisticated skills in dealing with high technology in a diverse society. In the UK, we no longer accept policing as a form of licensed thuggery or nursing as a version of domestic service. Medicine and law abandoned apprenticeships because they were no longer fit for purpose. In a modern economy, this is true of a growing range of occupations. Adam Smith recognised that the division of labour was a dynamic and evolutionary process: some of his successors might do well to remember this. Professor Robert DingwallNottingham \u2022 Though Aditya Chakrabortty identifies many of the reasons why increasing student numbers is failing, another factor is that, unlike law and medicine, many of the new vocational degrees lack rigour and don&apos;t teach the skills potential employers might desire. Bizarrely, degrees in hospitality and tourism don&apos;t require a compulsory element of learning foreign languages. Instead they invariably offer sandwich years in English-speaking countries, even if these are on the other side of the world, when basic skills in meeting and greeting foreign guests might just be the clincher in getting a good job in this sector. After all, some hotels even send their staff on courses to learn basic Japanese, as this is a partially lucrative market in the Lake District and the Cotswolds. David NowellNew Barnet, Hertfordshire \u00a0 \u2022 We have a situation now where 40% of 18-year-olds go to university. When I went in 1963, it was about 4%. But while graduates have increased tenfold, the number of graduate jobs hasn&apos;t. This may give us a better educated population, but does nothing for the graduates with no jobs and huge debts, or the economy overall. So it was some amusement I read of the Guardian roundtable on apprenticeships, because it seemed that most of those involved were your typical arts graduate, with little experience of industry, and none with an actual apprenticeship background. But perhaps that&apos;s the English way \u2013 a good arts generalist can speak for hours on subjects of which they know little.John OwenCaerphilly \u2022 The launch of FutureLearn couldn&apos;t have come at a better time (Report, 18 September), as there is a real danger of the UK falling behind when it comes to the 21st-century higher education provision. Despite being the home of the Open University, we have seen the likes of the US steal a march over the past few years in distance learning. However, key to the success of moocs (massive open online courses) in the UK will be ensuring assessment reliability as without it the credibility of the qualifications will continue to be questioned. Sweden and Singapore, seen as leaders in assessment, are successfully using technologies and practices developed in the UK. Learning habits and business needs are changing, so we must embrace change if the UK is to remain at the forefront of higher education.Matt WingfieldChairman, E-Assessment Association \u2022 Much of the coverage of moocs has been along the lines of &quot;look at Harvard and MIT, they were doing this years ago&quot;. But the real innovator of moocs is surely India. The Indian government has looked to moocs not as an interesting technological channel for knowledge transfer but as part of the answer to a growing social problem: the burgeoning demand for higher education and the inability of traditional institutions to meet it. This has spurred a notable programme of government investment in moocs and e-learning \u2013 even to the extent of distributing tablet computers to mooc participants. The real point of contrast is not simply technological, but in the state&apos;s willingness to invest in expanding its higher education sector.

If a recent report  published by Forbes magazine and Grant Thornton is to be believed, I now have even more to be envious about. According to this alarming report, 51% of senior management positions in mainland China are held by women. This places China at the very top, miles ahead of the 24% global average rate. When I spot the UK&apos;s relative position in this report, I am astounded. Not only do we lag significantly behind China, with a mere 19% of senior management positions held by women \u2013 we also feature in the bottom ten. And it gets worse \u2013 we are alarmingly close in the rankings to India; a country where discrimination against women is deep-rooted and widely prevalent. I am both intrigued and disturbed by this report. What is China doing to support the progression of women that we aren&apos;t? One commonly cited school of thought evolves from the political and social context of China. The emancipation of women has been a longstanding political issue in China; particularly since the People&apos;s Republic of China was founded in 1949. Since then, the communist parenthesis has strongly encouraged the employment of women outside the home. As a result, China was one of the first countries to ratify the UN International Convention on the elimination of discrimination against women. It was one of the first countries to implement legislation specifically for the interests of women. It was after such laws came into force that women began to seek employment in state owned enterprises and corporations. During the last few decades, however, large numbers of women working along production lines and other firms have been laid off and left in poverty. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor women in such scenarios are pushed into entrepreneurship. This &quot;poverty push&quot; often serves as a real driver for women to succeed. However, Alpesh Patel, the British government&apos;s senior dealmaker for China and author of the female entrepreneurship book Our Turn, strikes a note of caution here. &quot;In my capacity as the dealmaker responsible for India, China, Malaysia and Singapore, I do not recognise this 51% statistic. Even in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, I haven&apos;t seen women holding senior positions,&quot; he said. &quot;If the 51% statistic does hold true, I would stress two points for the UK to consider: are women in the UK falling behind because they chose to? Or has the one child policy in China led to more women being forced into becoming the breadwinner?&quot; These observations lead me to draw the following conclusions: 1. We need to do more to support any policies and targets which seek to address this issue in the UK. The social and cultural revolution in China and principles of communism meant that China was able to achieve such targets that would never be palatable in western liberal democracies. In the UK, even positive discrimination targets are seen as a negative form of intervention. 2. We need to ensure that equality measures are relative. While a 2% year-on-year growth may indicate progress, this may not be the case when other countries are reporting double-digit growth rates. 3. We need to change our mindset and believe that we women can go further. Zhang Xin, CEO of SOHO China, said that &quot;in China, no matter what industry you&apos;re in, you can try something new and put all your thoughts into doing so, because nothing was previously there. It still feels like anything is possible&quot;. 4. This is a complex issue which hasn&apos;t been adequately tackled in the UK. We have a long way to go. I look forward to reading next year&apos;s report and seeing the UK shift from the bottom ten category into the top ten. After all, anything is possible.

I marvelled at the shiny terrazzo floors and range of titles on display, pleasantly surprised at how things had changed in 20 years \u2013 the bookstores of my teenage years had been sorry affairs, meagrely stocked with yellowing copies of Penguin Classics wrapped in cellophane. Among the inevitable stacks of candy coloured chick-lit novels and John Grisham thrillers, one title caught my eye: the recently released paperback of Alan Hollinghurst&apos;s Booker-winning The Line of Beauty. In a country where homosexuality remains illegal, the open sale of the book was surprising. Flicking through the book for signs of indelible ink blacking out offensive passages, I was pleasantly surprised to find that nothing had been censored. Perhaps the authorities hadn&apos;t realised what &quot;rimming&quot; meant, I thought; but how could I explain the presence of the F-word, gleefully sprinkled through the novel, or indeed the scenes of drug-taking? Had the relevant authorities actually read the book? Or could it simply be that times had changed, and that freedom of speech \u2013 for so long the scourge of the young nation states of Asia \u2013 was flourishing unhindered? I grew up in a country where censorship was a way of life, so much part of the individual and national psyche that every creative act seemed to be defined by its relationship to authority. Like most young boys, my awareness of the censorship of printed works began in a faintly laughable way \u2013 we got used to seeing words describing body parts deleted by permanent marker (applied by hand, it seemed), and black strips across women&apos;s breasts, even when they seemed to be wearing bikinis. But beyond this schoolboy sniggering there was always the spectre of banned books in the background: memoirs of communist figures, political or religious novels, sexually explicit works \u2013 anything deemed to threaten the security of a young, unformed nation state, whether in a political or moral sense. Within this restrictive framework, writers were able, of course, to find ways of expressing themselves, but they did so with a constant awareness of the boundaries within which they were operating, and of the consequences of misjudging the constantly changing limits of what was acceptable. The same sentiment expressed in different political climates would meet differing outcomes: the writer&apos;s life was a barometer for political, racial and cultural sensitivities. But two decades of economic growth ushered in the new millennium, and money brought with it a sense of freedom. People could choose how to educate themselves, how to dress, where to live; they were free to travel abroad, where they would be exposed to new ideas; they had a stronger sense of who they were in relation to the hitherto all-protecting, all encompassing machinery of the state. And, above all, the swelling wealth of the last decade brought with it the internet, that great instrument of free speech. The easy access to anti-establishment newspapers, blogs and self-publishing online would seem to render state censorship completely futile \u2013 even the infamous great firewall of China has trouble keeping up with the anti-government software and proxy servers that virtually every savvy urban dweller possesses. But those vague delineations of censorship seem to have worked their way seamlessly into the equally hard-to-define and forever-shifting ways of the internet, making the game of eluding censure even more complex than it was before. Amir Muhammad, the influential Malaysian filmmaker and publisher, claims never to have had a book banned, in spite of at least two of his films being denied even a limited release. But he points to a deeper problem: the ingestion of decades of dogma and a climate of low-level fear leading to self-censorship, that precludes the need for overt state action. The largest chain of booksellers in Malaysia has refused \u2013 independently of direct government pressure, it would seem \u2013 to sell any of the Malay-language pulp fiction novels that Muhammad publishes because the presumed moral laxness of those books &quot;might somehow lead to baby-dumping and adultery&quot;. Similar books published in English \u2013 the language of the bourgeois urban middle-class \u2013 are deemed perfectly safe (which would explain the presence of Hollinghurst&apos;s books, which couldn&apos;t possibly be a corrupting force because hardly anyone would buy them). In conversations with Muhammad, I&apos;m struck by how the old-fashioned methods of censorship that people of our generation are accustomed to \u2013 the ostentatious removal of a few offending titles by gangs of policemen \u2013 are fading away to be replaced by censorship of a more elusive and dangerous kind: the deadening, self-censoring qualities of abundance and ambivalence. Vampire love stories, zombie novels, S&amp;M rendered banal by the internet-born Fifty Shades of Grey: on the face of it, such novels might suggest greater freedom, but in fact they point the way to a greater conservatism and homogeneity, the crowding of the publishing space by these books in countries where issues of freedom, religion, sexuality and social equality still need to be written about in intelligent and nuanced ways. The financial rat race in modern Asia means that people seek escapism and fantasy in their downtime rather than complex, depressing novels about the human condition. What young people are reading in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia \u2013 not to mention the great superpowers of China and India \u2013 would indicate that the censor&apos;s job is no longer necessary, precisely because of the breaking down boundaries (or at least the illusion of it). Muhammad jokes that he is thankful for the occasional brush with authority, for it prolongs the impression that publishing is a risky and exciting business. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t know what to do in a country that had no taboos.&quot; But he and I both know that the face of censorship is changing, and that the worst fate for a book is no longer for it to be banned, but to sink into the ocean of titles on the internet."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/26/top-10-budget-beach-hotels-malaysia", "sentences": ["Doubles from\u00a359, B&amp;B Maznah Guest House, Cherating, Pahang     Photograph: John Brunton    The east coast of Malaysia is one long tropical sandy beach, stretching 400 miles from the Thai border in the north down to Singapore, with dozens of islands that are perfect for scuba diving."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-26T05:00:00Z", "title": "Top 10 budget beach hotels in Malaysia", "tags": ["Malaysia holidays", "Hotels", "Travel", "Beach holidays", "Top 10s", "Budget travel"], "article": "Colourful Motel, Pantai Cenang, Langkawi It is difficult to imagine a more idyllic escape than Langkawi, 104 tiny islands that shoot up out of the deep blue Andaman Sea, offering divine beaches, coral-reef diving, jungle walks and accommodation that caters for every budget, from total luxury to funky backpacker hostels like Colourful Motel.

One lot of people ruling another lot without asking their permission.&quot; It was with such elegant simplicity that Anthony Lawrence, who has died aged 101, became one of the most highly regarded and influential of BBC foreign correspondents. From 1956 to 1973 he reported from the far east on such historic events as the Cultural Revolution in China, the bloody birth of Bangladesh, the independence of Malaysia and Singapore and, above all, the Vietnam war. He would use everyday scenes as the way to interpret complex political developments to an audience thousands of miles away in the UK. His radio dispatches in news bulletins and on the programme From Our Own Correspondent gripped many a listener, including a young John Humphrys, whom he inspired to become a foreign correspondent. Despite his clipped tones, which were fashionable for the time, Lawrence was born to a lower-middle-class family in Wimbledon, south-west London, and one of his first memories was of seeing soldiers gathered at Wimbledon station in 1917 on their way to the Flanders front. Just as he enthused others, so Lawrence was inspired to become a journalist by his uncle Arthur, a diplomatic correspondent on the Daily Mail. He won a scholarship to King&apos;s College school in Wimbledon, after which he began working on the Wimbledon Advertiser in 1930, where the strict subeditor, Mr Hurst, knocked his copy into shape. Lawrence joined the army on the outbreak of the second world war and was posted to France with the Royal Artillery, where he rose to the rank of captain. Tragedy soon struck, however. Back at home, his wife, Sylvia, who was pregnant with their first child, was killed in a bombing raid. When the war ended, Lawrence was part of the occupying forces based in Hamburg, where he helped to set up the magazine Die Zeit, which was to become Germany&apos;s most popular weekly. He fell in love with his secretary, Irmgard Noll \u2013 &quot;the enemy&quot; as he affectionately called her \u2013 and the couple married in 1946. On his return to Britain that year, Lawrence joined the BBC World Service and rose through the newsroom until his appointment as far east correspondent in 1956, based in Singapore. BBC rules meant that Irmgard and their eight-year-old son, Alex, were not allowed to join him for a year. One of his first assignments was to witness a nuclear explosion on Christmas Island, describing the &quot;pinks, greys and dark purple&quot; of the mushroom cloud. Lawrence decided early on that understanding China and the Chinese was the main point of working in the far east, yet he was denied access to mainland China. Instead he relied on informed opinion often expressed in &quot;fragments of talk in the small hours with a Chinese man in a cafe backroom with cigarette smoke coiling in the lamplight&quot;. In 1956 American power was at its height in Asia. Ten years later it was gone. In his book Foreign Correspondent (1972), Lawrence blamed America&apos;s failure to understand Asian communism as the reason for the decline in its influence. Rather than the American interpretation that it existed as an ideological attack on free enterprise and human freedoms, communism to the Asians he believed offered instead a redress against corrupt rulers. As he put it: &quot;Communism was the armed man who came in the night, talked sense about local affairs, murdered disagreeable police inspectors and took a couple of pounds of rice off you to help him on his way.&quot; The BBC moved its far east HQ to Hong Kong in 1958 and Lawrence went with it. Irmgard learned Mandarin so well that she was able to teach it. Lawrence made dozens of trips for both radio and television to report on the Vietnam war. His memorable radio despatches in From Our Own Correspondent painted a human picture of war through their depictions of the horrors suffered and inflicted by the ordinary US soldier out in the forest. &quot;The man next to you goes down yelling with a leg blown off. The platoon commander is bleeding to death against a tree. It is over in 15 minutes, but it is a nightmare. And it may come again tomorrow night.&quot; Lawrence retired from the BBC in 1973 and helped to establish the Hong Kong branch of the charity International Social Services, which provides help across borders for such groups as refugees, asylum seekers and torture victims. As a tribute to his work, the organisation named one of its refuges after him. He was also a founder member of Hong Kong&apos;s Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club and served for a period as its president. Lawrence wrote several books, including China: The Long March (1986), about the epic journey that led to the birth of the communist state under Chairman Mao, and The Fragrant Chinese (1993), about the residents of Hong Kong. He was appointed OBE earlier this year for his services to the community of Hong Kong.

Originating from the Indonesian island of Sumatra, the forest fires are an annual ritual. But this year, the public outrage in Singapore reached a crescendo, fueling a heated blame game between governments and companies. It&apos;s no coincidence that the fires mostly started in large sections of cleared forest while preparing plantations for global commodities such as palm oil, pulp and paper. It&apos;s also no coincidence that stopping forest destruction is part of the solution. Until companies and governments act to protect forests and peatlands rather than destroy them this annual crisis will reoccur. Sustainable palm oil? According to official Ministry of Forestry maps, Indonesia lost 1.24m hectares of forest between 2009 and 2011, equivalent to 620,000 hectares per year. Greenpeace International recently revealed in new mapping analysis that the palm oil sector was the single largest driver of deforestation in Indonesia between this period, accounting for about a quarter of the country&apos;s forest loss. The analysis shows that significant deforestation took place in concessions currently owned by members of the palm oil industry&apos;s largest sustainability organisation, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), including companies such as Singapore-based Wilmar International. More damning is the revelation from the mapping analysis that RSPO concessions accounted for 39% of the fire hotspots on palm oil concessions in Riau between January and June this year. While the blame game played by regional governments gave way to promises of tougher action, little has been done to hold the companies accountable for their role in years and sometimes decades of forest destruction. Companies that operate massive holdings of land or work through a complex system of third party supply chains simply pointed to their zero burning policies, the complexity of Indonesia&apos;s opaque mapping systems, and the role of smallholders in lighting the fires to avoid responsibility. The long road to transparency The RSPO wants its members to be industry leaders in sustainability, but its current standards leave them free to destroy forests and drain peatland. While RSPO members might have no-fire policies, the peatland they have cleared and drained is like a tinderbox. Why? The choking haze is the result of decades of forest destruction and clearance on peatland: a carbon-rich, naturally moist mass of organic material. But when this peatland is cleared and drained \u2013 mostly by large plantation companies \u2013 it dries out. One spark is all it takes for it to flare up. Traders, such as Wilmar International, are part of the problem. It controls much of the palm oil trade from Indonesia. The palm oil traded through its refineries is a mix of both responsibly produced oil and oil that has resulted from deforestation and destruction of critical wildlife habitat and peatland. While the RSPO has stated that the mapping analysis is wrong, it knows that concession boundaries are not an exact science, given the conflicting data and lack of a central mapping system in Indonesia. The RSPO should make public the maps provided by the companies and the legal status of those maps to better aid stakeholder scrutiny. In response to the mapping analysis, the RSPO has reviewed its member&apos;s operations. Of the members reviewed, only one has had a formal complaint raised against it. Greater transparency and openness will force companies to be accountable for the fires that are claimed to be in their concessions. Is there light at the end of the tunnel? While it has received bad PR, palm oil does not have to be synonymous with forest destruction. The link can be broken and some companies are starting to move in the right direction. When Greenpeace campaigned over the sourcing policies of big brands such as Nestle and Unilever, they committed to zero deforestation, which in turn pressured one of Indonesia&apos;s largest producers, Golden Agri-Resources, to commit to a forest protection policy. Other big palm oil players have joined the Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG), a coalition of NGOs and palm oil producers, which aims to stretch the RSPO principles to break the link between deforestation and palm oil. The RSPO has its uses, but to really break the link with forest destruction, companies must go beyond it. To claim to be sustainable means more than nice words. It also means being accountable and being transparent to all your stakeholders; it means being proactive and enforcing rules. The people across south-east Asia who suffered from choking air pollution and environmental destruction have a right to know where these fires originated and how they intend to tackle the root causes. Transparency is just the first step towards greater forest protection, and a cleaner, healthier planet. Bustar Maitar is head of the Indonesia forest campaign at Greenpeace International.

Documents released on Friday reveal that the warnings came, not in response to al-Shabaab, the group held responsible for this week&apos;s attack in Nairobi, but in relation to Somalia&apos;s impending independence. The colonial papers, which have remarkable contemporary resonance, were hidden in British colonial files and unearthed by officials only after an outcry over the suppression of evidence concerning the torture of Mau Mau fighters in pre-independence Kenya. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has admitted that it destroyed many official records on the turbulent years leading to white Southern Rhodesia&apos;s unilateral declaration of independence before the creation of an independent Zimbabwe. Papers in a file entitled &quot;Southern Rhodesia pre-independence records&quot; no longer exist, and officials are unsure of the whereabouts of top secret files stored in a separate building \u2013 Curtis Green, between Whitehall and the Thames. The documents that have been released raise fresh questions about Whitehall&apos;s handling of records officially regarded as part of the nation&apos;s heritage. Papers relating to security and riots in pre-independence Singapore are being withheld until at least 2028. Under section 3 (4) of the 1958 Public Records Act, Whitehall is allowed to suppress documents indefinitely for &quot;administrative purposes&quot; or &quot;any other special reason&quot;. The papers that have been released show senior British colonial officials and intelligence officers were deeply anxious about instability when Somalia won independence from Italy and Britain in 1960. &quot;Neither administratively nor economically will the country be viable as an independent sovereign state without outside help,&quot; British colonial officers warned. The committee was concerned about the radical Somali Youth League and problems on the Kenya/Somali border caused by &quot;warlike tribes, grazing land disputes \u2026 and the influx of refugees&quot;. A leading Somali figure from the south expressed concerns that Kenya&apos;s northern frontier district would &quot;fall in due course like a ripe plum&quot;, and a report by Whitehall&apos;s Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) points up the threat to neighbours. &quot;The political situation in Somalia is already unstable and the government may lose control,&quot; Sir Patrick Dean, the chairman of the JIC in April 1960, said. &quot;The country might relapse into anarchy and tribal warfare.&quot; Intriguingly, a passage following a reference to &quot;the formation in Somalia of a base for subversion into east and central Africa&quot; has been censored. Other papers released on Friday reveal that Britain offered thousands of pounds to the Cypriot informers and interpreters who helped the colonial forces in their struggle against the Eoka insurgency in the 1950s to enable them to resettle in the UK. In echoes of the current dispute over whether Afghans who have helped British forces have the right to settle in the UK, the files give details of 35 Cypriot informers, though their names are redacted.

Here are our top tips for social enterprises looking to increase their outreach and impact internationally. Leverage technology  Technology is part of our everyday life and through mobile phones we have the power to reach virtually every human being on the planet. If you want to maximise your chances of generating an impact, leverage technological tools that help you reach a large share of the world&apos;s population. For this matter, you&apos;ll also find yourself drawing the young generation&apos;s attention to your cause. Mobile games are played and enjoyed by individuals worldwide \u2013 being able to convey the message you want to spread through a medium inherent to people&apos;s life will offer more possibilities at making an impact. Engage youth in your approach In today&apos;s digital world, we have to find new ways of using technology to engage youth in global issues. At Decode Global we encourage an inclusive approach where young people can participate in the development of our games and their content. Whether it&apos;s through our fellowship programme or calls to action through school networks, we continuously seek to involve youth in our activities to get them thinking critically about world disparities and spark their interest around social issues. Focus on a solution-oriented approach It&apos;s all about the messaging. The tone with which you choose to convey your message defines its receptivity. Rather than focusing on the problem you are trying to address, focus on solutions you&apos;re promoting to help solve the problem. Individuals are easily alienated by initiatives that focus on negativity and despair. Choosing a compelling and optimistic route will be more likely to inspire individuals to take action in spreading the word about your cause. We have found an opportunity in storytelling in games \u2013 a simple yet powerful medium to get a message across. Surround yourself with a multicultural team If you&apos;re looking for international reach, recruiting international team members is key. You can benefit from greater collaboration abroad and a larger network that will help extend your reach not to mention counter language barriers. Having an international team has helped us gain market insights and feedback on how the game was received across the world. Be flexible  Any collaboration at the international level requires significant communication commitments and reporting. Working with India, Singapore, Europe and US has taught us the importance of regular check-in meetings and flexibility in working hours. Thankfully, free communication tools such as Skype and Google documents have made it easier. Partner with organisations for sustainable solutions Greater things are accomplished together and finding the right partners with aligned mission goals is key. Raising awareness is our first step in making a difference in the world. We partner with non-profits that work towards alleviating the issues highlighted in our games. Recently, we&apos;ve partnered with a non-profit bringing clean and safe drinking water to people in developing countries to strengthen the message of our game and maximise its impact by committing ourselves to real field projects. Measure your impact As with financial evaluations, measuring your impact is becoming critical for both the credibility and success of any social enterprise. Taking the necessary steps to assess your social impact should be as important as your mission at making an impact. Measuring the impact of games is a relatively new concept and tools designed to this effect have yet to be developed. This is where we collaborate with academic institutions and research centres to help us develop metrics and understand the impact of our games.

Its image is hardly the best. Huge tankers plying the sea, belching noxious gases into the air from low-grade crude and pumping out invasive species when emptying their ballast-water tanks on shore. Oh, and a catastrophic oil spill every now and then. Yet the shipping industry, which carries around 90% of all world trade, is pursuing its own re-balancing story too. The last 15 years have seen a drop in oil spills (despite a massive increase in oil cargos), a general reduction in harmful gases such as nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide, and an uptake in fuel efficient ship design. That said, the search for perfect equilibrium continues. Shipping is today responsible for around 2.7% of all man-made greenhouse carbon emissions \u2013 a figure the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the industry&apos;s UN-backed standard setter, would like to see reduced by 20% come 2020 and 50% by 2050. It is within this context that some of shipping&apos;s leading players have been beavering away together over the last 18 months. The mandate of the cross-industry Sustainable Shipping Initiative (SSI), which includes members such as Maersk Line, Lloyd&apos;s Register, Cargill, DNV, Unilever and W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, is to &quot;contribute to \u2013 and thrive \u2013 in a sustainable future&quot;. The initial output of their efforts appears in a progress report published yesterday. The report coincided with an industry-wide get-together in Singapore, attended by everyone from ship-owners and charterers to shipbuilders and marine financiers. Flying the flag for green tech An overriding message from the report, entitled A case for more action, is the role that technology will play in greening the world of shipping. The clearest example centres on energy efficiency, one of the central themes on SSI&apos;s agenda. Leading ship owners are already seeing gains through waste heat recovery systems, for example, which use captured heat and pressure in the exhaust gas to drive on-board electrical generators. The addition of advanced pumps and valves, as well as scrubber technology on the exhaust, is also shown to cut energy and fuel use. Maersk Line is one of those putting technological innovation at the heart of its energy efficiency strategy. The container ship division of Denmark-based Maersk Group, which last year hit its 25% CO2 reduction target way ahead of its 2020 deadline, is planning to introduce 20 Triple-E ships into its fleet. The 400 metre-long container vessels, which are equipped with dual, state-of-the-art 32MW two-stroke diesel engines, use a strategy known as &quot;slow steaming&quot; (namely, travelling at under 18 knots). &quot;The Triple-E ships will take the industry in a new and more environmentally conscious direction, emitting 20% less carbon dioxide per container moved compared to the most energy efficient container vessel operating today&quot;, says Thomas Riber Knudsen, chief executive of Maersk Line&apos;s Asia-Pacific operations. Where SSI differs from existing approaches is in its belief in cooperation. The full potential of the latest technology will only be realised through industry collaboration, says SSI director, Helle Gleie. Going it alone will only ever get the industry so far. And that&apos;s not far enough. The report cites the case of testing. Too often, cutting edge technologies stall because of the risks associated with taking them from computer or tank testing to in-service sea testing. Access to finance is just the same. Startup companies with innovative ideas lack the cash to fully develop them. Overcoming such hurdles requires the industry as a whole to work together, says Gleie. SSI provides several illustrations of what such cooperation might look like. On the question of financing side, for example, the group has launched a green investment mechanism called Save as you sail. Developed with the support of Dutch bank ABN Amro, the tool allows ship owners and charterers to identify estimated fuel cost savings and return on investment associated with green retrofits. This information can then be used to set charter hire rates, as well as for a short-term loans to cover the upfront costs of green upgrades. The starkest example of where industry collaboration is required is that of closed-loop materials management. What materials go into ship-building and what happens to those materials afterwards touches on the industry&apos;s entire value chain. To connect the various dots, SSI has worked with technology firm Hewlett Packard to develop an online database to track and trace these materials. The approach has yet to be tried at scale, although early pilots on two new vessels and a cruise ship cabin succeeded in capturing 96% of the materials used (by weight). Industry-wide rules ahoy The challenges ahead are by no means insignificant. It&apos;s welcome that a progressive group of companies are working together, but the rest of the industry needs to join too. Expanding the scope and uptake of SSI&apos;s various pilot projects and tools will help in that. A good example is its new Rating Schemes service. Currently in Beta phase, the web-based tool is designed to help key players in the industry navigate their way through the dozen or so eco-rating schemes currently out there. Promoting regulation that will actively drive greater sustainability in the global shipping trade is crucial too. The latest chapter of the Marpol Convention, which came into force in January this year and establishes mandatory technical and operational energy efficiency targets for new ships, provides a good steer for the way forward. IMO spokesperson Lee Adamson commends the industry for being a &quot;very active and willing partner&quot; in the rule-setting process. That said, he warns that the &quot;very fluid and volatile&quot; nature of international shipping means globally agreed rules are required. A common regulatory framework means &quot;you can&apos;t wiggle out of things by shifting your operation to another country&quot;, he notes. More remains to be done to make international shipping truly sustainable. Yet Gleie reiterates that the time for talking is now over. &quot;We will take off now&quot;, she says about SSI&apos;s eco ambitions. &quot;We have to launch the vessel for real.&quot; Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

On Tuesday night the doors will shut for applications for shares in Royal Mail, and a week later it will start trading on the stock market. If you want to take part, how do you do so? But should you even take part at all? Early indications suggest that in purely stock market terms, the privatisation is likely to be a success. Within hours of the formal announcement of the sell-off, big institutional investors such as pension funds, and overseas investors such as the Singapore &quot;sovereign wealth&quot; fund, placed so many orders for shares that the issue is almost certain to be oversubscribed. Many now expect the shares to rise on the first day of trading, making instant profits for small investors who &quot;stag&apos; the issue by placing an order and selling up as soon as they receive the shares. But the greed of speculators could just as easily backfire, with warnings that strike action by postal workers within days of Royal Mail&apos;s privatisation may send the shares diving.  What is being sold? Up to 70% of Royal Mail is for sale, which is the postal and delivery service, not the Post Office or its branches. A base offer of 40.1%-52.2% of shares in the company is being made available to big City investors and private individuals, plus extra shares worth up to 7.8% of the company will be made available if demand is high (the &quot;over-allotment option&quot;), plus 10% is being given free to staff. The government is expecting about seven out of 10 shares to be bought by big institutions in the City and overseas, and the rest by individuals. How much will shares cost? The offer price will be between 260p and 330p a share, implying a total stock market value of Royal Mail of between \u00a32.6bn and \u00a33.3bn. The final pricing and allocations of shares will be announced on 11 October. How much can I buy and how? The minimum amount you can invest is \u00a3750. You can use a debit card on the official government site to buy up to \u00a310,000 of shares, but it won&apos;t accept credit cards. If you want to buy more than that \u2013 and there is no limit on the size of application you can put in \u2013 you have to download the application and apply by post. Other options are to pop into a branch of the Post Office, or use one of the scores of sharedealing services acting as official intermediaries. Paper application packs are available in 1,500\u00a0Post Office branches nationwide. Look on its branch finder to find one near you or call 0330\u00a0123 0147. How do I apply through a share dealer? All of the major dealers for small investors, such as Hargreaves Lansdown, Halifax, Barclays, Interactive Investor and The Share Centre, are on the list of approved intermediaries for the sell-off.  Generally speaking, you go online to the dealer&apos;s website and open a dealing account. You&apos;ll then have to pre-fund the account with the cash you want to spend on the shares. The minimum is \u00a3750, and after that dealers generally request you buy in thousand-pound lumps (\u00a32,000, \u00a33,000, etc).  There is no charge for buying, although if you want to keep the shares in an Isa, the dealer is likely to apply a fee. If and when you sell, there will be a dealing fee. These vary widely but Hargreaves, for example, charges 1%, with a minimum of \u00a320 and a maximum of \u00a350.  How long do I have to apply? The share offer will close at 11.59pm on 8\u00a0October and the notification of share allocations will be at 7am on 11\u00a0October. Trading will begin on the London Stock Exchange from 15 October. Will I get the shares I apply for? Share dealers are predicting high demand, based on inquiries they have so far had. But the government has said it will make additional shares available \u2013 cutting its own holding in Royal Mail \u2013 if demand is high. Even so, it is possible that the issue could be oversubscribed. If it is, your shares request will be scaled back \u2013 for example, you will only get \u00a33,000-worth of shares when you applied for \u00a34,000.  Are they worth buying? Many people will be opposed to this offer on principle, given that 96% of Royal Mail postal workers said they were against privatisation in a consultative ballot in June 2013 on a 74% turnout. The Labour Party conference voted unanimously for a motion committing the next Labour government to renationalise Royal Mail. Communication Workers Union general secretary, Billy Hayes, says: &quot;Why should you buy shares in something which you already own? Surely that is an odd thing to do. &quot;The Royal Mail is currently a publicly owned company meaning that you, I and all UK citizens essentially own it. If you happen to have a spare \u00a3750, which is the minimum amount being accepted for this sale, I would suggest you spend it on something other than a cherished national institution which would be better off remaining in public hands.&quot; The promoters of the privatisation are keen to put forward Royal Mail as an income opportunity at a time when interest rates on savings accounts are miserably low. The share price range implies an initial dividend equal to 6.1%-7.7%, which by any measure is attractive when cash Isas are paying 2% and the yield on the FTSE All Share is around 3%.  Previous privatisations, such as British Gas (famous for its &quot;Tell Sid&quot; campaign), have given small investors huge returns \u2013 although not all have been a success, with Railtrack&apos;s demise leaving many investors empty-handed.  Over the longer term, investors will have to take a view on the prospects for a business that has been hit hard by the decline in private letters (from 84m a day in 2005 to 58m now), but boosted by deliveries of goods bought over the internet. There is an official prospectus for the flotation of Royal Mail, detailing the business and its outlook. Operating profit margins at Royal Mail have risen from 0.2% to 4.4% in the past two years alone, but still trail Germany&apos;s Deutsche Post, which has a margin of around 8.4%. Its shares have soared from \u20ac16 to \u20ac26 over the past year, and the total stock market worth of the company is now nearly \u00a325bn, compared to Royal Mail&apos;s \u00a33bn. However, it&apos;s a very different business to Royal Mail, employing three times as many people and, crucially, owning global parcels business DHL.  Analysts say DP yields just 3% compared to 6%-7% for Royal Mail, and the latter has more of an opportunity to expand its margins.  In online forums where small investors discuss the prospects for shares, such as the Motley Fool&apos;s boards, interest in the flotation is high. As one contributor on fool.co.uk says: &quot;&apos;Stag&apos; this is entirely what I intend to do. I have no interest in actual investment in such a dour sector, however on the basis HM Government are offering shares to &apos;Sids&apos; (like me!) I do sniff some politically backed free money!&quot;. But another adds, &quot;Buy stock in a company with a disgruntled and unionised workforce that is considering strike action already? No thanks.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/28/this-weeks-new-films-blue-jasmine", "sentences": ["95 mins Gillen finds his identity slipping during a visit to Singapore in a sombre character study."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-28T05:00:00Z", "title": "Blue Jasmine, Prisoners, Greedy Lying Bastards: this week's new films", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Austenland", "Blue Jasmine", "It's a Lot", "Girl Most LIkely", "Greedy Lying Bastards", "Hannah Arendt", "Mister John", "Prisoners"], "article": "Blue Jasmine (12A) (Woody Allen, 2013, US) Cate Blanchett, Alec Baldwin, Peter Sarsgaard. 98 mins In the downward trajectory of late-era Allen comes a startling spike to remind us how great he still can be, especially when it comes to women&apos;s roles.

Tourists can expect to pay more than \u00a390 for a three-course meal for two even in far-flung parts of Australia such as Darwin, said the Post Office, compared with less than \u00a330 in Bali. A steep fall in the value of the South African rand has made holidays in Cape Town among the cheapest for those seeking winter sun. Sterling has risen 20% against the rand since last year, sending South Africa six places up the league table of 32 long-haul destinations to take runner-up spot. While a bottle of local lager would set you back an average of \u00a34.26 in Auckland, New Zealand, it costs \u00a31.33 in Cape Town.     Table Photograph: Table    Other cheap destinations include Vietnam and Thailand, but the figures reveal that price variations are not just about the local level of economic development. For example, prices in Tokyo, once the world&apos;s most expensive city, are below those of Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and even Costa Rica, the Post Office found. A basket of holiday goods \u2013 from suntan cream to insect repellent, plus food and drink, would cost \u00a3106.08 in Tamarindo, Costa Rica, compared with \u00a3103.58 in Tokyo. Meanwhile, prices in US locations such as San Francisco and Washington DC are below those of Rio de Janeiro and Beijing. Sri Lanka, which was the cheapest long-haul destination in 2012, has experienced a surge in prices making it more expensive than Thailand. The mighty Australian dollar which, despite a 10% setback, remains one of the world&apos;s strongest currencies, has made holidays in there almost prohibitively expensive. The Post Office found that a small chocolate bar (Mars Snickers) would cost \u00a31.81 in Darwin but only 48p in Orlando, Florida. A bottle of Coca-Cola is \u00a32.66 in Auckland but only \u00a31.27 in New York. Overall, the recent recovery of sterling against most major currencies has made winter sun holidays on average better value than last year, with prices down in sterling terms in half of the destinations surveyed. Jamaica saw the biggest prices falls, of around a third since 2012. &quot;After a summer when sterling bought less holiday cash for trips to Europe, winter sun tourists can look forward to seeing their pounds stretch further in many of the most popular long-haul destinations,&quot; said Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/29/mister-john-review-aidan-gillen", "sentences": ["There are clear comparisons with this eerie second feature, in which Aidan Gillen's listless Gerry Devine travels to Singapore in the wake of his brother's death, and winds up wearing his clothes, living in his house, and perhaps rekindling his watery ghost."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-28T23:04:02Z", "title": "Mister John \u2013 review", "tags": ["Drama", "Film", "Aidan Gillen", "Culture", "Mister John"], "article": " \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe first feature film from writer/ director team Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor was Helen, a breathtaking examination of fluid identity about a young woman playing a missing girl in a police reconstruction.

This is after all the mobile device platform that&apos;s selling so badly that even one of Blackberry&apos;s main electronics suppliers is considering dumping it. Queues weren&apos;t a problem for registering for BlackBerry Jam Asia Curiously, a large number of people queuing up for their free Blackberry Dev Alpha device at the conference entrance told me they were not developers. That didn&apos;t seem to stop them from enjoying their new gadgets however - which came with a conference attached. And attending the conference was cheap: the regular rate was a mere US$149, or US$99 if you had registered before 30 August. Certainly, even the most wildly optimistic developer couldn&apos;t have missed the backdrop of huge losses for Blackberry with ensuing staff cuts as well as the pending sale of the company - and more importantly, the announcement by the company that it will be getting out of the consumer device market altogether.  A group of Indonesian developers in the shuttle from the airport laughed sanguinely at the prospect of arriving at an empty conference hall after the flight from Jakarta, but collectively reckoned that while things were looking bad at the moment, there was still a glimmer of hope for Blackberry. However, if developers expected a pep talk from Thorsten Heins, the Blackberry chief executive whose job it is stem the decline and to return the Canadian company to something resembling its former glory, they were sorely disappointed. Heins stayed away from Blackberry Jam Asia 2013. &quot;He is not attending unfortunately \u2013 probably a bit busy right now,&quot; a Blackberry spokesperson said. A BlackBerry Dev Alpha device for $50 - plus a free conference? Deal Hong Kong without the bustle Unlike its bustling, busy host city Hong Kong, Blackberry Jam Asia 2013 turned out to be a leisurely affair. There were no throngs or queues to anything, and the keynote hall was at the most two-thirds full.  A Blackberry spokesperson reckoned around a thousand had registered, but didn&apos;t have a figure of how many actually showed up. Certainly, Blackberry Jam Asia 2013 seemed thin on developer presence. The showcase comprised two official Blackberry stands for gaming and enterprise apps, an app advertising sales vendor and official merchandise. That was it though. No large third-party app developers had stalls, and the breakout technical sessions were sparsely attended. On stage at the keynote, Nguyen Long demonstrated his Sayit voice recognition app, which is similar to Apple&apos;s Siri personal assistant - but more flexible. SayIt is the work of Nguyen alone, which is even more impressive considering it does voice search in 17 languages and can translate from English in 25 different tongues.  The demo went down well with the audience, but Nguyen took some of wind out of his own sails by announcing that SayIt was on sale at a steep 60% discount, the second time since July.  Giant Chinese micro-blogging service Sina Weibo showed off its free Blackberry client and Indonesian developers Omega Mediatama the Kereta Api train ticket booking app; the Vietnamese and Indonesian developers claimed they made good money out of their apps, and the Sina Weibo client is apparently very popular in China despite Blackberry having next to no market presence in that country. Free devices, monetary guarantees and generally lowered barriers of entry for developers haven&apos;t helped set Blackberry&apos;s BB10 platform on fire however, with revenues more than halving in the Asia-Pacific region.  Asia-Pacific was, until the most recent quarter, a growth area for sales - but now they&apos;re down. Apps for the many, from the few Continuing on the theme of popularity and success, Alec Saunders, vice president of Blackberry&apos;s developer relations, tried to fire up the audience by claiming there were now more than 131,000 apps for BB10 alone in Blackberry World. What&apos;s more, Asia-Pacific developers account for some 37% of all BB10 apps in Blackberry World, according to Saunders. That would be around 48,500 of the 131,000 total currently. Alec Saunders of BlackBerry on stage A spokesperson for Blackberry said the controversial and prolific Hong Kong based S4BB Ltd, which accounts for around a third of all apps in Blackberry World, was not included in that number  But at a media session later the same day, Saunders admitted that S4BB accounts for a quarter of all BB10 apps in Blackberry World, or around 32,750 of the total \u2013 leaving just 15,750 apps from other Asia-Pacific developers. S4BB has over 48,000 apps in Blackberry World; most are city guides and audiobooks, sourced from public material. This is fine, a flustered Saunders said. S4BB has built a &quot;template application&quot; and the apps are not junk, he claimed. &quot;They make a lot of them \u2013 more power to them,&quot; Saunders said. &quot;I looked at the applications, and you know what? Those provide value,&quot; he said. A scout around for S4BB at Blackberry Jam Asia 2013 failed to turn up a representative for the company. Other developers spoken to at the event smiled at the mention of S4BB, but wouldn&apos;t say say anything harsher about the Hong Kong software house than &quot;they probably don&apos;t need any more publicity.&quot;  Saunders and his team of 123 has toured the world, handing out over 45,000 free Blackberry phones to developers and promised to that people would make US$10,000 by building BB10 apps \u2013 if not, Blackberry would make up the difference. These probably were a powerful incentive in low-income nations around Asia, and Saunders believes over half of developers have uploaded an app to the Blackberry World store. Easier, cheaper.. HTML5? The company has also worked to make development of BB10 apps easier and cheaper, Saunders said, by following standards such as C and C++ for the programming language and HTML5 for application presentation.  The disappointing amount of revenue from a mere 3.7m devices does not mean Blackberry is about to quit the retail end of the device market, because the corporate bring your own device (BYOD) trend is too important, a spokesperson for the company said. However, the spokesperson did not explain how it intends to succeed with BYOD when clearly few people want Blackberry devices. One person who thinks Blackberry will still have a future was Marcus Tan, the Singapore-based managing director for Asia-Pacific of Smaato, a global advertising exchange for apps. Smaato has been selected by Blackberry to be its official partner to hook up developers and app publishers with advertising networks and to provide features such as in-app ads. Tan thinks providing revenue streams beyond straight app sales will help make the Blackberry platform more popular with developers, but admits that it is late to the game with the advertising and monetising features, which other mobile platforms have had for years now. Other mobile platforms \u2013 that is, Apple iOS and Google Android \u2013 is where the action is for the developers at Blackberry Jam Asia, with many saying they work across all three platforms. Focusing on competing platforms isn&apos;t exclusive to Blackberry developers either, but to the Canadians as well.  The Secure Workspace solution that allows Android and Apple i-Devices to be managed with the Blackberry Enterprise Server 10 was heavily touted at the event, a feature that the company&apos;s senior director of enterprise developers and tech partnerships joking said was &quot;good job security.&quot; The Canadian handset maker tried very hard to convince the audience at the Blackberry Jam Asia 2013 event that it was headed towards success after past mistakes. Judging by the empty conference centre early the second day, developers didn&apos;t quite get the message.

And while it is the office towers in London&apos;s centre that are making all the headlines, the city is also building high-rise residential properties far and wide, with reports that there are more than 140 residential towers of 20 or more storeys either recently completed or in the pipeline. (Recently on this network, Hannah Fearn argued that high-rise was the only solution to avoid building on the green belt.)     Robin Hood Gardens, the Greater London Council housing estate build in Poplar in the 1960, now being remodelled. Photograph: Geoffrey Taunton/Alamy    Despite this apparent popularity, high-rise living is still unappealing to many, and in particular to families with children who see the lack of social-communal spaces and the distance between the flat and the street as a physical and psychological barrier. This is hardly surprising given that low-rise suburban living can offer the street, the protective front garden and the generously-sized back garden, whereas all high-rise can seemingly offer is the corridor and lift-lobby, both squeezed down to the minimum that regulations allow, and more often than not, without access to natural light and view. The upshot is that, without spaces and facilities for play, interaction and recreation, the high-rise seems only to appeal to three demographic groups: young singles, couples, and empty nesters (those who are older and whose children have left home). For families it is the dream of the two-storey house and garden that prevails, and fuels the exodus of couples from apartment living to the suburbs when children arrive on the scene. Some have suggested a solution is a shift in our aspirations, but surely we also need to change the design of these monotonous residential towers if they are to appeal to a broader cross-section. Perhaps inspiration can be found by looking east, and in particular, to Singapore. In this city-state of more than 5 million people, an astonishing 85% of the population live in high-rise social housing, leading to innovative design solutions and regulations to improve the quality of life at height. Perhaps nowhere is this more apparent than in the Pinnacle@Duxton \u2013 a development of seven towers linked together with skybridges at the 26th and 50th floors which include a host of social spaces such as an outdoor gym for the elderly, children&apos;s play area, mini parks and seating areas, and perhaps most radically, an 800-metre running track linking together the seven towers, all with access to view, light and air in a safe environment above the city.     The massive Pruitt-Igoe housing project in St Louis Missouri, built in 1954 and demolished in the mid 70s. Photograph:   Bettmann/Corbis    The economics stack up too. Singaporean regulations allow developers who include community spaces at height to build taller, and to exclude such spaces from the taxable area of their developments. This has led to towers with skygardens springing up all over the island, with lush, planted social spaces appearing at height across the city. To many, these concepts are nothing new, being just an extension of the modernist ideas of streets-in-the-sky, such as the post-war developments at Pruitt-Igoe in the US and Robin Hood Gardens in Poplar, London, both of which failed spectacularly. But these failures were not just architectural, with a lack of mixed-use programs, poor maintenance and a lack of broader occupant social support also carrying the blame. However, these ideas are now being reinvented and reinvigorated in Asia, transforming streets-in-the-sky from the glorified concrete corridors of the 1960s to lush green spaces, with dedicated functions and activities, which are well maintained and looked after. While future UK housing will likely be multi-typological, with terraced, low-rise and strategically located high-rise all necessary, tall buildings can never fulfil their potential until we make living at height appealing to families with children. And this means designing gardens, terraces and streets in the sky.

George Osborne has hailed the government&apos;s new conditions on unemployment benefits as tough love, report Patrick Wintour and Nicholas Watt. Speaking on Radio 4&apos;s Today programme, he said:  There&apos;s no option of doing nothing for your benefits. No something for nothing anymore.  In his Politics Live blog, Andrew Sparrow reports on the Conservative party conference in Manchester where Osborne has addressed conference on the benefits plan. Randeep Ramesh says Osborne&apos;s tough talk on workfare may be popular with the grassroots, but it won&apos;t get the long-term unemployed back into work. And writing for Comment is free, Barbara Ellen says the plan to make the unemployed work for their benefits is breathtakingly wrong.  It seems not only unfair, but also impractical, to expect people to work unpaid while simultaneously seeking paid work. Job-hunting is an exhausting, complex, time-consuming affair, as has been demonstrated by the lamentable performance of the Work Programme. Moreover, the unemployed must surely be completely free to seek work, not semi-free. The term is &quot;jobseeking&quot;, not &quot;jobseeking, when I&apos;m not labouring just to earn my benefits, so that I don&apos;t starve&quot;. What does this resemble if not a state-sanctioned form of moonlighting?  Elsewhere, Joanna Long, member of Boycott Workfare, a UK-wide campaign to end forced unpaid work for people who receive welfare, said:  Community workfare schemes literally treat the unemployed as criminals \u2013 with far harsher sentences than if they had committed a crime. Osborne&apos;s announcement is a PR rehash of schemes that are already failing to help people find work on a massive scale. It&apos;s bad news for people who will be forced to work at far below the minimum wage \u2013 and it&apos;s terrible news for the people whose jobs they will be replacing. This is about cutting the safety net for unemployed people, and handing something for nothing to charities, companies and councils which should be paying wages and taxes.  The Guardian also reports today that Iain Duncan Smith is examining how to make it harder for sick and disabled people to claim benefits, according to leaked documents from the Department of Work and Pensions. \u2022 &quot;Early-onset dementia&quot;.

The MPs will tell the Co-op party&apos;s annual conference on Friday that the crown estate, which comprises vast tracts of land and commercial property across the UK, should be freed up to invest in foreign property and much-needed infrastructure projects in Britain. Gareth Thomas, chair of the Co-op party&apos;s group of 33 Labour MPs, said such a sovereign wealth fund could boost growth and help pay the UK&apos;s debts. Thomas said: &quot;A British sovereign wealth fund could promote co-operation with fast-growing overseas businesses, earning the UK vital income over the long term. &quot;Modernising the rules governing the crown estate could, for example, allow it to invest in up-and-coming property markets in G20 states like China and India or in new technology businesses, helping Britain secure access to innovative ideas developed abroad.&quot; The estate manages the \u00a38.6bn of land and property that the crown owns, but which the Queen does not control and cannot sell. The estate is accountable to parliament, and pays its surplus income to the Treasury to offset the cost of maintaining the royal family. The Treasury said there were no plans to develop a UK sovereign wealth fund to rival the \u00a315bn French and \u00a3875m Italian government funds, though the local government minister, Eric Pickles, is consulting on whether to create a &quot;superfund&quot; from the UK&apos;s assorted state pension schemes, which have amassed almost \u00a3200bn in assets. There are 89 local government pension schemes, with around \u00a3150bn under management; several others, including the Royal Mail pension scheme and the fund for MPs&apos; pensions, have built up assets from investments in shares and bonds. However, pension funds are excluded from the list of sovereign wealth funds, which are expected to generate wealth for the nation as a whole. Thomas said that, with a change in the law lifting restrictions that limit it to property and land in Britain, the crown estate could become a sovereign wealth fund and develop its investment strategy. Last year the estate generated a surplus of \u00a3253m from its investments after making an 11.9% annual return. The bedrock of the estate is the Prince Regent&apos;s London property holdings, built 200 years ago, which run from Regent&apos;s Park through Oxford Circus and Regent Street to St James&apos;s Park. Seabeds managed by the estate are leased to offshore windfarms, and land across the UK is home to many other renewable energy schemes, business parks and factories. The fund was boosted last year by the acquisition of the Coliseum shopping park, in Cheshire, and Silverlink shopping park, outside Newcastle. Lifting restrictions on the estate would, Thomas said, allow it &quot;to begin to explore ventures into overseas property markets, for example in the Asian Pacific region, where eight of the world&apos;s largest 20 property markets are located, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India, or taking a stake in companies set up to bring new technologies to market&quot;. Most of the largest funds rely on oil and other commodity revenues to boost their assets under management. Norway already has a \u00a3460bn sovereign wealth fund generated from taxes on its oil and gas industry. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China have also amassed huge wealth in funds that have become active investors in foreign markets, including the UK. It is estimated that government-backed funds account for around $30tr (\u00a318.5tr) of global assets, the same as the estimated $30tr of pension funds&apos; assets. Since the beginning of 2008, which marks the high point for most stock and bond markets, funds registered with the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute have increased their assets by 59%. Much of the gain is from oil and gas revenues, which soared after the eurozone crisis caused a wholesale price rise. The top 15 sovereign wealth funds, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute 1. Norway (Government Pension Fund Global): $737.2bn 2. Saudi Arabia (SAMA Foreign Holdings): $675.9bn 3.

Mary sets out on her bicycle, bursting with romantic expectation, and returns from the pub next morning bereft, having spent the night with furniture stacked against the door to avoid being raped. Unlike Mary, O&apos;Brien never lived on a mountain. &quot;We lived down from the mountain,&quot; she says. &quot;That is not to say we were very well off, not by the time I came, but our house was a little grander, while\u00a0not being really grand.&quot; But she spent summer holidays with\u00a0her grandmother up the mountain, lonely and spartan weeks she didn&apos;t enjoy at all, and knew the disdain with\u00a0which the &quot;mountainy&quot; people of\u00a0western Ireland were regarded by the richer, more worldly inhabitants of\u00a0the\u00a0bigger farms and towns. Like Mary, O&apos;Brien yearned to get away (&quot;to stay in a hotel and have breakfast in bed&quot;, as the girl in one of her novels puts it). Unlike Mary, and the women in most of her stories, O&apos;Brien did escape, first\u00a0to a job behind the counter of a\u00a0pharmacy in Dublin and then, as\u00a0the runaway bride of the writer Ernest G\u00e9bler, to London. There she wrote her first, famous novel about her childhood, The Country Girls, in a blast of nostalgia and relief at all she had left behind. Written in the first person and widely admired for its sauce \u2013 among other escapades, Caithleen and Baba get themselves thrown out of their convent school for writing a dirty note \u2013 the book was banned and burned in Ireland. O&apos;Brien has since published 30\u00a0more books \u2013 mostly fiction, but also\u00a0plays, biographies and a memoir. Now\u00a0she has gathered together a career&apos;s\u00a0worth of stories in a 500-page retrospective called The Love Object. O&apos;Brien&apos;s novels have been divided into phases: the early, autobiographical books about women&apos;s struggles and desires; the later state-of-the-nation works about Irish history and politics. Her stories don&apos;t really fit this template, so\u00a0the new book demands we reconsider O&apos;Brien, and stakes a claim for her work overall,\u00a0a claim backed by John Banville in an introduction that compares her to Henry James. &quot;Somehow there was the perception, which is completely off the wall, that I had this gilded, adulterous life moving from one affair or soiree to another. Well, you can&apos;t write all these books and rear children and earn your living and have a gilded life,&quot; she says, spitting out the word &quot;soiree&quot; as if it disgusts her. &quot;You can&apos;t work on a book one day a week. It&apos;s like a toddler off out into the street: you can&apos;t find it again. So in that sense, I am possessed.&quot; Standing in the doorway of her study, she rubs her fingers together as you might over a piece of fabric, or when making pastry. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to get the truth in it, and the sheen on it,&quot; she\u00a0says. But if her private life after her brief and unhappy marriage ended was never the sex and champagne binge of legend, it is no surprise her parties are a source of fascination. For a time, O&apos;Brien supped with Hollywood royalty \u2013 Robert Mitchum, Marlon Brando, Jane Fonda. &quot;It still baffles me how I came to know all these people,&quot; she wrote in her memoir Country Girl, &quot;some serendipity threw us together and united us in the chimera of the swinging 60s.&quot; But she is proud of how far her talent, ambition and all-round attractiveness took her. And why not? The new\u00a0book is dedicated to Philip Roth &quot;in long friendship&quot;. Her memoir describes her\u00a0delight, while staying with Harold Pinter in Dorset not long before he died, at being kissed by another visitor:\u00a0Jude Law. Along with some teaching in New York, O&apos;Brien has always supported herself by writing, and I meet her in the Knightsbridge house around the corner from Harrods that she has rented for nearly 30 years. She lost two previous homes. Selling number 10 Carlyle Square in Chelsea was a personal tragedy she has blamed on &quot;love, generosity, the pipe dream&quot; \u2013 another way of saying she forgot to take care of practicalities, so consumed was she by one of her affairs. More recently, she sold at a loss the house her architect son, Sasha, built for her in\u00a0Donegal. Her experiment in homecoming was ended by the antagonism of her neighbours who didn&apos;t want a famous writer in their midst, and the fact that she found she was unable to write there. She says she is &quot;a bit pathological&quot; about noise, needing silence to concentrate (she abandoned a flat where a dog barked incessantly in the communal garden), but feels less lonely in the city. Her house is cluttered with books and papers: pages\u00a0of notes, a\u00a0novel by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, her\u00a0own work in progress piled up on\u00a0a\u00a0table. Technology is a struggle: &quot;My emails are legendary. They&apos;re so\u00a0illiterate \u2013 not deliberately, but like moments out of Finnegans Wake: you can&apos;t make anything out!&quot; She does not\u00a0drive, and swims with armbands. Does she have a method when she writes? &quot;I have to read something astonishing beforehand. Very often it is\u00a0a poem, or it can be a scene from Shakespeare that is absolutely dynamic and contagious in that it gives one a longing to write something that isn&apos;t totally a dud.&quot; She breaks off to fetch her diary from a desk, and reads aloud a few lines by Ezra Pound. &quot;I write with a pen, by hand. Of course I make endless cups of rooibos tea. Then I write a paragraph and read it aloud to see if it stands up in any way. Usually, out of 10\u00a0lines there might be three words that are OK. So it&apos;s a question of rewriting, rewriting, rewriting. I do not\u00a0call it a labour of love; I call it a labour of semi-madness. Then I keep with it, go for a little walk. It&apos;s getting a\u00a0little harder for me now, harder on the eyes. I&apos;m 82 this Christmas. I work for five or\u00a0six hours each day but my achievements in those hours are not great. If we&apos;re going to measure it in pounds, shillings and pence, it&apos;s more pence than shillings.&quot; O&apos;Brien was the youngest of four\u00a0children born to farmers in Tuamgraney, County Clare, and this household, the neighbours, surrounding countryside and town with its 27 pubs never let her go. &quot;It&apos;s not describing a\u00a0field or a gate or a bog or an avenue; it&apos;s\u00a0the emotional association with those places that makes a line come true or alive,&quot; she says. Most of all she was drawn to her mother: &quot;Everything about her intrigued me: her body, her being, her pink corset.&quot; But the rhythm of life was beaten out by her father&apos;s cycles of bingeing and remorse, as he left the work to hired help and spent the family&apos;s remaining money on drink and horses. &quot;Those two old chestnuts, parents, come up again and again,&quot; she says. &quot;We are to a\u00a0great extent unconsciously ruled by our first experiences. Sometimes we hide the fact and sometimes we fight it; the only thing we can do in order to emerge from it is\u00a0to admit it. So I admit my mother within me, the mother who wrote me hundreds of letters, all of which, in their own way, and ironically for a woman who mistrusted the written word \u2013 especially my written words \u2013 was a born writer. They&apos;re little masterpieces, my mother&apos;s letters.&quot; O&apos;Brien broke with her parents when she ran off with G\u00e9bler, sending a\u00a0letter from the Isle of Man where her\u00a0father pursued the couple in a fury. She\u00a0was 23 and pregnant when they married. G\u00e9bler, who had already been\u00a0left by one wife, was nearly 40. He envied O&apos;Brien&apos;s success from the start, and the marriage was a disaster. In her memoir, she describes him grabbing her throat in\u00a0a\u00a0row before she\u00a0left him in 1962. Reconciled with her parents,\u00a0she went on taking her two sons on holiday to Ireland. But the family remained a tangle, and a grim scene followed her mother&apos;s death, when the family home, which Edna believed was meant for her, went instead to her brother. Meanwhile, her romantic life followed its own turbulent cycle. She never remarried but became deeply attached to a married man thought to have been a senior politician. In her memoir she called him Lochinvar; his real name remains unknown: &quot;I think everyone has the right to a secret and that&apos;s mine,&quot; she says now. I understood the last page of her memoir to confess she is still in love with one of them, but she quibbles with my choice of words when I say so, and quotes back at me the phrase she used: her love &quot;had not died, and so it lived on and on, in that dark suck of secrecy&quot;.  O&apos;Brien&apos;s memoir also reveals that around 20 years ago, in a hotel in Singapore, she planned to kill herself. &quot;I was all askew,&quot; she says. &quot;I was rather frail for a while.&quot; Around the same time, she was rushed to hospital after her appendix burst. Years before, she had tried psychoanalysis with RD\u00a0Laing. She took him figs; he gave her LSD. Now\u00a0she sought out another analyst, Alexander Newman, who &quot;helped bring me\u00a0back together again&quot;. But he could not shield her from her critics. A profile of Gerry Adams she wrote for the New York Times in 1994 saw her insulted in public \u2013 &quot;I was asked am I a groupie? I&apos;m nobody&apos;s groupie&quot; \u2013 while Edward Pearce, writing in this newspaper in the same year, called her &quot;the Barbara Cartland of long-distance republicanism&quot;, an epithet she shows no sign of forgetting. &quot;I remember being very hurt and often furious as well as hurt, absolutely livid, with the audacity and covert jealousy of some reviewers,&quot; she says. &quot;Of course every writer has been attacked and every writer thinks it&apos;s unfair, but I\u00a0remember being absolutely heartbroken when Down by the River came out. It&apos;s a story of incest and was triggered by the Miss X case [a court ruled that a teenager who had been raped could not travel to\u00a0the UK for an abortion]. It&apos;s a very\u00a0serious book which began in a deliberately lyrical style, and most critics savaged the book for that lyricism.&quot; She says she felt murderous, but not any more. &quot;Fashion is fashion and\u00a0I\u00a0have to believe in what I do and how I\u00a0do it. But I also believe that time changes, perception changes. Some younger women, such as Rachel Cooke, are not as dismissive about my writing as some of the older female critics, and the male ones. I did mind terribly, but I\u00a0don&apos;t mind now, because things have\u00a0bucked up a bit.&quot; A\u00a0few years ago O&apos;Brien moved to a\u00a0new\u00a0publisher, Faber, and in 2011 won\u00a0the \u20ac25,000 Frank O&apos;Connor international short story award for her\u00a0first collection of stories in two decades, Saints and Sinners, beating former winner Yiyun Li and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. It was her first big literary prize, setting the scene for the memoir that followed last year, and for The\u00a0Love Object, which includes most\u00a0of the prizewinning stories. Mostly these stories are about Ireland; conscious that critics have attacked her limited range, she lists those set in other places. She is particularly proud of &quot;Shovel Kings&quot;, about the migration of Irish labourers to London and partly based on interviews she conducted in pubs. I\u00a0like &quot;Green Georgette&quot;, which starts, like many of her Irish country stories, with an awkward social situation \u2013 a mother and daughter about to be snubbed \u2013 and explodes in a fantasy of violence and tinned peaches: &quot;Mama said it would be an extravagance to open a tin at that hour, while promising we would have them some Sunday with an orange souffle, which she had just mastered the recipe for. Mixed in with my longing was a mounting rage. Our lives seemed so drab, so uneventful. I prayed for drastic things to occur \u2013 for the bullocks to rise up and mutiny, then gore one another, for my father to die in his sleep, for our school to catch fire, and for Mr Coughlan to take a pistol and shoot his wife, before shooting himself.&quot; O&apos;Brien has kept her accent and sometimes lowers her voice to an atmospheric whisper. She can be dramatic, as when she says: &quot;I would die now if tomorrow morning I could not write.&quot; But she is also friendly, generous and disarmingly honest, for\u00a0example about having had a story, &quot;Chekhov&apos;s Ladies&quot;, rejected by a magazine last year. The experience shook her and afterwards she laid low and did a lot of reading. Then she began a new novel about the night economy of migrant cleaners. She expects it to take another 18 months, after which she is determined to write two plays and see them put on. She is anxious not to appear self-aggrandising. &quot;I don&apos;t mean I&apos;m gifted,&quot; she says at one point, and apologises for comparing herself to James Joyce. But O&apos;Brien does take herself seriously. When she refers to other writers, they are not contemporaries \u2013 whom she flatly refuses to comment on for fear\u00a0of\u00a0causing offence \u2013 but Beckett, Nabokov, Conrad, Tolstoy. She wrote a\u00a0play about Virginia Woolf. It sounds old-fashioned in 2013 to talk about the source of creativity as a well or a &quot;little brazier down there at the bottom of the fire&quot;, to refer to a work&apos;s &quot;inner truth&quot; and compare the\u00a0&quot;quick shot&quot; of a story with the &quot;unending road&quot; of a novel, to talk about aspiring to what S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard called &quot;purity of heart, which, according to him, is what makes\u00a0one do the thing, whether it&apos;s embroidering an altar cloth or making a\u00a0creme brulee or writing a story&quot;. But that is how O&apos;Brien, shaped by\u00a0her early encounters with literary modernism, self-taught and without a university education, thinks about art. Banned, burned and blamed for all manner of failings, including not being feminist enough, she has remained true to her idea of what a book should be: &quot;What I don&apos;t want is\u00a0for the imagination to have ropes around it. I want to be free. It&apos;s hard enough to write. I&apos;ve had the Catholic church, I&apos;ve had my mother, I&apos;ve had nuns and priests from the age of nought telling me what I shouldn&apos;t do;\u00a0I don&apos;t want it!&quot; She says she is glad to be asked about her critics, and relishes the chance to answer back: &quot;I don&apos;t want to\u00a0make a big deal of it, but I did get an awful lot of cudgels thrown at me down the years, and I don&apos;t want to sound self-pitying because I&apos;m not self-pitying, but I do think what the fuck was that about?&quot; Why does she think so many writers have come out of Ireland? &quot;Desperation and a gra for the language.&quot; The word is pronounced &quot;graw&quot; and she has to spell it out. &quot;G-R-A, it&apos;s a lovely word, it&apos;s the Irish word for love.&quot; \u2022 The Love Object: Selected Stories by Edna O&apos;Brien is published by Faber on 5 October."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/02/michael-gove-social-justice-reverse-strikes", "sentences": ["This is a lesson that even countries such as Singapore and China, which Gove frequently praises, are taking on board, and are making radical changes to their testing regimes as a result."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T09:11:45Z", "title": "Michael Gove offers social justice in reverse.

It was a lacklustre speech that sounded more like a list of acknowledgements. For a large section of it, he thanked his ministers: Edward Timpson for helping children with special needs; Liz Truss for shaking up childcare, school meals and the exam system; John Nash for extending the free schools and academies programme; and former minister Nick Gibb for championing reading in schools. He praised the pupil premium for helping children on free school meals and predictably attacked the &quot;militant&quot; unions for striking on the day of his speech. He didn&apos;t convince me, though, that his policies amounted to a radical programme that is going to close the huge attainment gap between rich and poor pupils. Indeed, for teachers such as me who see the destructive effects of his policies in the classroom, much of what he said was misleading. His policies are, in reality, social justice in reverse: his game is giving more power to those who are already privileged and stripping away existing safeguards for poor and vulnerable children. His claim that his policies are helping children with special educational needs (SEN) is laughable: the money that was there to help many thousands of children struggling with SEN has vanished, and the introduction of &quot;do or die&quot; tests on grammar and reading across the age range, starting with five-year-olds, will inevitably mean that SEN children will be labelled failures from a very early age. His obsession with exams is misguided on many levels, as this week&apos;s letter signed by nearly 200 experts, including the poet laureate, points out. I know as a teacher that many of my students fail to show what they can do by scribbling manically in an exam hall for a few hours. Gove doesn&apos;t understand that we need to assess the whole child, that a student&apos;s speaking and listening skills, their ability to problem-solve, their facility to think creatively, are more important than rote-learning. This is a lesson that even countries such as Singapore and China, which Gove frequently praises, are taking on board, and are making radical changes to their testing regimes as a result. At the moment, in many schools, the &quot;exam tail&quot; is wagging the dog: much of what goes on, particularly in years 5-6 (ages 9-10) and years 10-13 (ages 14-17), is all about &quot;prepping&quot; for very high-stakes tests. Even private school headteachers such as Tim Hands don&apos;t like it. Gove&apos;s policies have made what was a bad situation even worse. Just this week he announced that the first GCSE grade a child gets will be the only one that counts for the school league tables. While the situation of endless GCSE resits that some schools were doing was not great, most teachers feel this is the fault of the school league table system, not the concept of having a &quot;resit&quot;. If you have a system of high-stakes exams solely determining pupils&apos;, teachers&apos; and schools&apos; livelihoods, you are always going to get people &quot;gaming the system&quot; in whatever way they can. Gove&apos;s policy of closing schools with &quot;below par&quot; exam results is turning schools into exam factories. His free schools and academy programme, which he congratulated himself on in his speech, has amounted to giving billions of pounds to the privileged. Most free schools, schools set up by parents or special interest groups, take fewer children on free school meals on average than maintained schools, and many academies generally admit children from wealthier backgrounds, thus fuelling the very social segregation that Gove says he is solving. Furthermore, his claim that the pupil premium will help poorer students is not being borne out by the evidence. A recent study has shown that it has having a limited impact: that&apos;s potentially \u00a32.5bn wasted on a dysfunctional programme. Gove claimed in his speech to be very grateful to younger teachers in the profession and headteachers pushing through his policies \u2013 although he neglected to thank middle-aged teachers like me. But the fact is, most teachers I&apos;ve spoken to don&apos;t like his policies or his belligerent tone \u2013 that&apos;s why we are backing the strikes that are happening throughout the country. We aren&apos;t militants, as Gove claims, but teachers who feel battered by the way he has eroded our pay and conditions, drastically curtailed our freedom to teach, and exacerbated the very social segregation he purports to be eradicating."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/oct/02/how-to-make-perfect-singapore-noodles", "sentences": ["I spent some enjoyable minutes flicking through a book on Singaporean cuisine, pausing at recipes for prawn laksa, and egg roti, fish head curry and hainanese chicken rice, before discovering that Singapore noodles are all but unknown in that country \u2013 in fact, they&apos;re a Cantonese creation, popular in the restaurants, street stalls and tea houses of Hong Kong.", "Singaporeans, apparently, get cross at being asked about it.", "Noodles     Delia Smiths's Singapore noodles    Super-thin rice noodles, or vermicelli, are de rigueur here, but as with pad thai the secret is all in the preparation.", "Protein     Ken Hom's Singapore noodles    As with so many noodle dishes, the protein element is very much up to the individual diner.", "Vegetables     Ching-He Huang's Singapore noodles    That said, non meat-eaters won&apos;t go hungry without tofu, because Singapore noodles tend to boast a plethora of vegetables, from kale or cabbage (Mabbott) to beansprouts and carrot (Huang).", "Spices and garnish The first rule of Singapore noodles is that they have to be a bright, unnatural yellow: it&apos;s the law.", "Liquid     Taste Hong Kong's Singapore noodles    All the recipes, apart from that of Taste Hong Kong, add a little liquid to the noodles as they cook.", "Method     Lizzie Mabbott's Singapore noodles    As with all stir-fries, the trick is in the mise en place: have everything lined up next to the hob, ready to go, before you so much as light the gas.", "Perfect Singapore noodles     Felicity Cloake's perfect Singapore noodles    (Serves 2) 125g rice vermicelliHandful of green beans2 \u00bd tsp curry powder3 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp rice wine or dry sherryPinch of sugar2 garlic cloves, crushed1 tbsp peeled and grated ginger root1 green bird&apos;s eye chilli, finely chopped2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal6 water chestnuts, sliced\u00bd red pepper, thinly sliced5 shitaake mushrooms, slicedHandful of peas50g prawns50g char siu pork or cooked chicken, shredded1 egg, beaten with a pinch of salt and a splash of sesame oil2 tbsp peanut or other neutral oilHandful of chopped coriander, to serve Put the vermicelli in a bowl, and tip boiling water over until covered.", "Singapore noodles: greasy takeaway stodge or Cantonese culinary genius?"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T11:14:57Z", "title": "How to make perfect Singapore noodles", "tags": ["Seafood", "Fish", "Chinese food and drink", "Food & drink", "Main course", "Life and style", "Meat"], "article": "I spent some enjoyable minutes flicking through a book on Singaporean cuisine, pausing at recipes for prawn laksa, and egg roti, fish head curry and hainanese chicken rice, before discovering that Singapore noodles are all but unknown in that country \u2013 in fact, they&apos;re a Cantonese creation, popular in the restaurants, street stalls and tea houses of Hong Kong. Why they&apos;re credited to somewhere else entirely is a mystery \u2013 I wonder, given the famous fusion cuisine of that island, whether it might be something to do with the curry powder that&apos;s often responsible for the dish&apos;s violent hue, but if anyone actually knows, please do spill the beans. Whatever the story behind the name, any country should be proud to claim this fine dish as its own. Singaporeans, apparently, get cross at being asked about it. If they&apos;re not keen, maybe we should make a bid for it instead? Noodles     Delia Smiths's Singapore noodles    Super-thin rice noodles, or vermicelli, are de rigueur here, but as with pad thai the secret is all in the preparation. The noodles need softening before they&apos;re added to the wok. Approaches to this vary from cooking them and leaving them to cool \u2013 from the blogger Lizzie Mabbott, aka Hollow Legs \u2013 to merely soaking in warm water: Ken Hom suggests 25 minutes, Delia Smith (who credits her recipe to the late, great restauranteur Ken Lo) 15 minutes and Ching-He Huang a paltry 10. Smith and Huang&apos;s noodles are a bit chewy for my taste, while Hom&apos;s seem rather mushy (of which more later). Mabbott&apos;s are perfectly cooked, although I slightly prefer those from the blog Taste Hong Kong, which takes a similar approach but scalds them in boiling water for a mere 30 seconds before leaving them to cool and dry for half an hour. The strands remain more separate, although I find they need very slightly longer in the hot water for my taste. Protein     Ken Hom's Singapore noodles    As with so many noodle dishes, the protein element is very much up to the individual diner. Prawns are common; Taste Hong Kong marinates them in salt and white pepper before use, but with so many other salty elements in the dish, I&apos;d prefer to let them remain au naturel. Smith uses dried shrimp, soaked in water, which I find too strongly fishy. Pork also pops up a lot: Smith and Huang both use bacon, while Hom suggests ham or, like Taste Hong Kong, char siu pork. Smith gives the option of cooked chicken or pork, and indeed almost any meat you happen to have left over would work, but I really like the strong sweet and savoury flavour of the barbecue pork here. (If you&apos;re cooking the meat specially, I recommend this recipe by Nigel Slater as a solid place to start.) Egg also makes a nice addition \u2013 Taste Hong Kong whisk theirs with fish sauce first, while Hom seasons his with sweet, nutty sesame oil, which I prefer. Most recipes seem to stir the egg into the noodles, but I like to stir-fry separately it until it&apos;s almost set, so there are distinct flakes of egg in the finished dish. Mabbott uses tofu puffs, which she describes as &quot;optional, but great for texture&quot;. They do indeed add an interestingly chewy element to the dish; I don&apos;t want to overload it with ingredients, but if you&apos;d prefer to keep it strictly vegetarian, they&apos;re a good thing to consider. Vegetables     Ching-He Huang's Singapore noodles    That said, non meat-eaters won&apos;t go hungry without tofu, because Singapore noodles tend to boast a plethora of vegetables, from kale or cabbage (Mabbott) to beansprouts and carrot (Huang). To be honest, the choice is largely up to you, but the selection below offers a pleasing contrast of flavour and texture: red pepper (Huang) and peas (Hom) for sweetness, water chestnut (Hom) and blanched green beans (Mabbott) for crunch, and shitaake mushrooms (Huang) for yielding chewiness and savoury flavour. (Hom and Smith both use dried mushrooms, but even after soaking I find these a little too chewy.) The fresh flavour of spring onions, meanwhile, works better here than Smith&apos;s yellow version, which has a tendency to melt into the other ingredients. Spices and garnish The first rule of Singapore noodles is that they have to be a bright, unnatural yellow: it&apos;s the law. The most usual way of achieving that colour is with curry powder, and it does the job nicely; if you&apos;re worried about them being pallid, you could add turmeric as well, as Taste Hong Kong suggests, but leaving out the curry powder altogether, as in Huang&apos;s recipe, misses a trick on the flavour front. Root ginger and garlic are also a must as a flavour base, and I like the hint of heat that Hom and Mabbott&apos;s green chilli provides. Coriander leaves, as used by the same pair for garnish, add a touch of colour and freshness to the dish. Liquid     Taste Hong Kong's Singapore noodles    All the recipes, apart from that of Taste Hong Kong, add a little liquid to the noodles as they cook. Smith makes a rich broth from the mushroom-soaking liquid and dry sherry, while Huang goes for soy and oyster sauce and rice vinegar, and Mabbott keeps things simple with a mixture of light and dark soy sauces. Hom, meanwhile, makes a fairly substantial sauce with coconut milk, sugar, shaoxing rice wine and chicken stock, which he then simmers the noodles in. I find this makes them a bit mushy, and though delicious the coconut flavour changes the character of the dish completely. &quot;It tastes sort of Thai,&quot; as my chief tester puts it. I like the savoury flavour of the rice wine (you can use dry sherry if you can&apos;t get hold of it) and soy sauce, rounded out with just a pinch of sugar; those who fancy a little more heat should sprinkle with Mabbott&apos;s chilli oil. Method     Lizzie Mabbott's Singapore noodles    As with all stir-fries, the trick is in the mise en place: have everything lined up next to the hob, ready to go, before you so much as light the gas. I also like Taste Hong Kong&apos;s tip for making the task a little easier. After describing the &quot;dai pai dong, that is the street-side open-air food stalls, where you might be able to witness their chefs tossing these noodles up in the air from the iron woks&quot;, the author admits that &quot;holding such a large cooking vessel is already a big challenge, not to mention manipulating the foods at the same time with one single arm&quot;. To reduce the workload, they toss the scalded noodles with curry powder and seasoning before adding them to the wok, so they&apos;re already well combined: all you have to do is heat them through. Those well-versed in the art of stir frying may wish to skip this step, but I found it helpful. Whether you cheat or not, the whole process should take little more than five minutes, plus drying time for the noodles. Not bad for a veritable feast. Perfect Singapore noodles     Felicity Cloake's perfect Singapore noodles    (Serves 2) 125g rice vermicelliHandful of green beans2 \u00bd tsp curry powder3 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp rice wine or dry sherryPinch of sugar2 garlic cloves, crushed1 tbsp peeled and grated ginger root1 green bird&apos;s eye chilli, finely chopped2 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal6 water chestnuts, sliced\u00bd red pepper, thinly sliced5 shitaake mushrooms, slicedHandful of peas50g prawns50g char siu pork or cooked chicken, shredded1 egg, beaten with a pinch of salt and a splash of sesame oil2 tbsp peanut or other neutral oilHandful of chopped coriander, to serve Put the vermicelli in a bowl, and tip boiling water over until covered. Leave for 30-45 seconds until softened, but not soft, then drain and leave to dry in a sieve or colander for about half an hour, tossing occasionally to make sure they don&apos;t clump together. Blanch the beans in boiling water, then drain and set aside. Add half the curry powder and all the soy sauce, wine and sugar and toss together well until the noodles are well coated. Put the garlic, ginger, chilli, spring onion and remaining curry powder in one bowl, the vegetables in another and the meat in a third. Put these near the hob along with the beaten egg. Heat the oil in a wok until smoking, then tip in the garlic and ginger mixture. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant, then tip in the vegetables. Stir-fry for a couple of minutes, then push to the side of the wok and tip in the egg. Allow to cook undisturbed until almost set, then scramble into the remaining ingredients. Add the meat and prawns and mix in, then tip in the noodles and toss everything together for a couple of minutes, so it&apos;s all well combined.

Nelson is also good on the death of the much-lamented big society, which is now the great Tory unmentionable. &quot;It lies in a shallow grave somewhere,&quot; says Nelson, &quot;but I rather liked it.&quot; Much as I enjoy the Bright Blue event, missing out on the curry is a disaster, as the search for food at conference is constant.

After doing the rounds of fringe meetings, I gatecrash a late-evening drinks reception at the Midland hotel \u2013 the sexually charged centre of the conference \u2013 hosted by Conservative Voice, which campaigns in Tory marginals. Nineteen-year-old Charlotte Woods, who is chair of Conservative Future in Manchester, kindly gives me her drinks voucher. &quot;Say nice things about me when I&apos;m an MP,&quot; she says breezily. Irritatingly I am not allowed into the packed Conservative Way Forward do at midnight. The Tory conference slogan is &quot;For Hardworking People&quot;. &quot;For Hard-drinking People&quot; seems more appropriate. My excesses mean I miss the Alastair Campbell run and breakfast in aid of Alcohol Concern at 7.30 the following morning. Campbell perfectly sums up conference in his parting tweet from Manchester: &quot;Tory conference v different from 20 years ago. Too corporate, not enough politics. Also reminds me of Russia \u2013 mainly ugly men and pretty women.&quot; Stumble through the lounge of the Midland in the early hours, and you see how accurate that description is. I spot the chief whip Sir George Young at a fringe meeting and tax him about the corporateness of conference. He starts to agree and to suggest ways more members can be encouraged to come \u2013 only 38% of the attendees in Manchester are party members; the rest are lobbyists and journalists \u2013 but then checks himself. &quot;Chief whips are not allowed to have views,&quot; he says. Young has come to listen to his old colleague Ken Clarke speak at a fringe meeting about whether Britain should leave the EU. Clarke makes much the best speech I hear over the three days, beautifully delivered, cogently argued, underlining once again that he should have led the Conservative party. Young, modest and unassuming, watches from the back of the room, a smile playing across his lips in appreciation of a master politician at work. Clarke is now in his 70s, but wipes the floor with the oratorically challenged young junior ministers I have to endure at other meetings. He has said he will stand again in 2015 \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m an incurable parliamentarian,&quot; he tells the audience at another meeting \u2013 and will be a key figure in the EU referendum campaign in 2017. Back in the main hall, George Osborne also makes a capable speech, if you set aside the inflated claims for what he has achieved. But it strikes me that while his desire to turn Britain into a dynamic, thrusting Asian tiger economy \u2013 all whizzing trains and fracking wells \u2013 will play well with the bright young things at conference, it may have limited appeal in Matlock or Middlesbrough. Conservatives don&apos;t seem to want to conserve anything any more. Boris Johnson echoes Osborne, portraying Britain as a larger Singapore and envisaging the UK becoming Europe&apos;s most populous nation. Their message is one of uber-liberalism and could play into the hands of Ukip, who present themselves as the party for people left behind in the global race. It&apos;s a relief to escape the secure zone after the two-hour session on the economy and experience the world beyond. The &quot;Kill Tory Scum&quot; man has been replaced by a large inflatable white elephant emblazoned with the slogan &quot;Stop HS2&quot; \u2013 Osborne gives the project a vote of confidence but most of the members I speak to want it scrapped. The street outside the venue is filled with people handing out flyers \u2013 another echo of the Edinburgh festival. &quot;This nation is under God&apos;s judgment,&quot; reads one leaflet. &quot;We will see increasing calamity in this nation and throughout the world. There is no hope for Britain, but there is hope for you.&quot; It is certainly an antidote to Osborne&apos;s relentless optimism.     Nigel Farage enjoys a pint and Ukip's ability to rock the Tory boat. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    The Bruges Group is holding a lunchtime meeting \u2013 with no free lunch, of course \u2013 in Manchester town hall, at which Ukip leader Nigel Farage is speaking. This feels like a proper political event, full of cameramen and ultra-enthusiastic Ukip supporters. Tory high command took the event out of the official programme, making it a cause celebre and ensuring a huge degree of interest. The echoey hall is gorgeous, so much more vivid than the characterless aircraft hangar in which the conference is being held, and Farage and veteran Conservative eurosceptic MP Bill Cash clash over whether Ukip should stand aside in 2015. Cash thinks they should, or Labour could win thanks to the split in the rightwing vote. Farage, who has an extremely loud voice, tells him to stop being patronising. This is all music to Ed Miliband&apos;s ears. I catch up with the Ukip leader later at A Beer and a Fag with Nigel Farage, an event at the Comedy Store, which is a 15-minute walk from the conference centre. He is, indeed, having a fag outside when we talk. Does he fear letting in Miliband and thus losing the in/out referendum on the EU that Cameron has promised? &quot;Why would we lose the referendum?&quot; he says. &quot;That presupposes Labour won&apos;t be offering a referendum at the next election, which of course they will.&quot; Farage is the ghost at the Tory feast \u2013 I speak metaphorically of course, given the absence of anything edible at the conference. Ukip polled just 3% in the 2010 election, yet are reckoned to have cost the Tories 20 seats. They currently stand at more than 10%, and if they got anything like that in 2015 the Tories would have little chance of winning an outright majority. &quot;The Tories have got this massive dilemma,&quot; Farage tells me. &quot;They just don&apos;t know what to do about us. Twenty-five per cent of their councils want to do a deal with us, but it&apos;s a deal that isn&apos;t going to happen. I&apos;d be relaxed about local associations doing deals, but Cameron has slapped that idea down. As ever I&apos;ve come here and tried to be helpful and constructive \u2026&quot; He laughs, long and loudly. He is rather pleased with the mayhem he has wrought in Manchester. &quot;Someone said to me when I came here this morning: &apos;God has wrecked your conference, now you&apos;re going to wreck Cameron&apos;s.&apos;&quot; It&apos;s an exaggeration; the conference has not been wrecked \u2013 if anything the Conservative party seems more at one with itself than when I was here in 2011 \u2013 but there is a recognition that winning in 2015 is going to be difficult. Clarke doesn&apos;t sound as if he expects to win outright. &quot;Getting a majority is going to be a very tall order,&quot; he admits. &quot;With multi-party politics it is very difficult.&quot; He says the party will have to win back &quot;sensible Conservatives&quot; who voted Ukip in this year&apos;s council elections, and rely on the Lib Dems reclaiming some of their more leftwing supporters from Labour. Peter Bone, the eurosceptic Tory MP for Wellingborough and serial rebel, has a better idea \u2013 join forces with Ukip. &quot;If we don&apos;t reach some agreement, it&apos;ll be the SDP-Labour model in reverse,&quot; he tells me after a fringe meeting at which he savages the coalition with the Lib Dems and argues Cameron foisted it on the party undemocratically. &quot;I think Ukip is here to stay. That&apos;s not the view of the leadership and I hope they&apos;re right, but if they are here to stay my solution has to be the answer.&quot; Sadly, the legendary Mrs Bone, barometer of Britain, isn&apos;t here to add weight to her husband&apos;s argument. &quot;She doesn&apos;t come to conference,&quot; he explains. &quot;She&apos;s too busy running the constituency office.&quot; The sort of accommodation favoured by Bone is unlikely to happen. Some on the right of the party would welcome it, but to others it would be anathema. If Osborne and Johnson want to turn Britain into a 21st-century Singapore, Ukip&apos;s model is more Sidcup circa 1952. They are worlds apart. &quot;Every European country has fringe parties, most of them on the right \u2013 anti-immigrant, anti-foreigner, anti-problems,&quot; says Clarke. &quot;You have to take them on and marginalise them.&quot;     David Cameron with his wife Samantha acknowledge the applause after his speech. Photograph: Leon Neal    Ann Widdecombe, who is doing a brisk trade signing copies of her autobiography Strictly Ann on the bookstall next to the main hall, believes the Tories can win without doing a deal with Ukip. &quot;Next year at the Euro elections we will suffer,&quot; she admits. &quot;The voters don&apos;t think the European elections matter and they can send us a pretty rude message about what they want. Ukip will take votes away on a temporary basis, but when it comes to voting for a government, people will think: &apos;You vote Ukip, you get Miliband.&apos;&quot; By the final morning, it has become a question of survival. Manchester is dank, and in the street outside the secure zone we are down to the hard core: the Falun Gong supporters protesting about organ harvesting; a chap in a dog collar standing on a soap box and preaching salvation in a voice as loud as Farage&apos;s; the anti-frackers, and a middle-aged man handing out leaflets detailing a worldwide Jewish conspiracy with Boris Johnson at its centre. I join the queue early for Cameron&apos;s big speech. The party members who have lasted the week are in good heart. &quot;This is my annual holiday,&quot; says one. &quot;It&apos;s the only way of getting a break from the seat.&quot; I am reluctant to admit it, but I quite like the Tories \u2013 dynamic, self-reliant, filled with a zealous certainty. And they queue beautifully. Cameron&apos;s speech is very, very competent, very son-of-Blair in its delivery and emotional range. He has some strong lines about finishing the job and securing the recovery, and the odd decent joke: &quot;There is no job in the world where you don&apos;t need to be able to add up [pause] ... unless you join Labour&apos;s frontbench economic team.&quot; The faithful like it. &quot;He was very strong and there were no gimmicks,&quot; an elderly man in a union flag waistcoat tells me. But the bits he cites are cliches such as the ubiquitous &quot;hand-up, not a handout&quot;. A speech that resorts to the hoary old metaphor about fixing the roof when the sun shines is not a great speech. I miss Boris&apos;s stream-of-consciousness surges and references to Diocletian, and it should worry Cameron that most of the interest in the press room afterwards is in 12-year-old Xantaine Campbell, who offers up a marvellous paean to her free school in Birmingham. Xantaine has the X factor; Dave doesn&apos;t. The man in the waistcoat is another Tory who supports a deal with Ukip. &quot;We both want the same thing,&quot; he says, &quot;and it&apos;s foolish to fight each other.&quot; But the closing music after Cameron&apos;s speech is unlikely to appeal to the faragists \u2013 Fleetwood Mac&apos;s Don&apos;t Stop, with its mantra: &quot;Yesterday&apos;s gone, yesterday&apos;s gone.&quot; The Ukippers reckon yesterday can be brought back, and if enough unreconstructed Tories feel the same, tomorrow might yet belong to Miliband."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/unilver-ceo-paul-polman-purpose-profits", "sentences": ["This is why we deliberately put our major training centre in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T21:56:00Z", "title": "Interview: Unilever's Paul Polman on diversity, purpose and profits", "tags": ["UN Global Compact Leaders Summit", "Unilever", "Engaging employees", "Collaboration", "Diversity"], "article": "Paul Polman, CEO of consumer goods multinational Unilever, is considered by many to be the leading light in the corporate sustainability movement. He recognises the power of partnerships as well as greater diversity and inclusiveness in driving change in what he describes as a Vuca world; volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. Criticising the financing sector for being self-obsessed and self-interested, he calls on all CEOs to recognise they &quot;cannot be a bystander in the system that gives you life in the first place&quot;. Polman brushes aside the profits warning Unilever made this week and says it will not sway him from taking a long-term approach to the business. What are the main ingredients for an effective leader? First of all, you need to feel comfortable about who you are. So a good leader, I think, is a good human being in the first place. Too often we are being programmed by the environment around us to behave differently. But I think a true leader is an authentic person, who feels good about who he is. I don&apos;t have a problem crying when I need to cry. There&apos;s nothing wrong with that and showing that you care because it&apos;s the same in any organisation; if you show that you care, others will care for you, 100%. Often people ask me what my job is and I say honestly it is to make others successful, and the more you do that the more you will see that you create prosperity. What is the role of humility in leadership? Working together on solving something requires a high level of humility and a high level of self-awareness. When we launched the Unilever Sustainable Living Plan, people inside the company were very worried about exposing ourselves. But I did something there that I didn&apos;t realise at the time, but that actually made a big difference, by just saying publicly I don&apos;t have all the answers on how to do this and I can&apos;t do it alone. I still say it today, and actually it&apos;s becoming more difficult as we progress towards the 10-year goal that we set. Is it important to have a sense of purpose? I know we all have our jobs, but that has to come from a deeper sense of purpose. You have to be driven by something. Leadership is not just about giving energy but it&apos;s unleashing other people&apos;s energy, which comes from buying into that sense of purpose. But if that purpose isn&apos;t strong enough in a company, if the top doesn&apos;t walk the talk, then the rest will not last long. The key thing for CEOs is to make that a part of your operating model. We all need to be way beyond CSR, and yet we still talk about it as CSR, which is basically activity-driven but not holistic. The concept of shared value is good but I think it is a post-rationalisation of not getting in trouble with society. Now some people will say that&apos;s too pessimistic but I think it&apos;s realistic. Companies will now have to provide solutions to some of these challenges and be co-responsible and that&apos;s a higher level than that we have talked until now. Unfortunately not many see it as being absolutely crucial but it will come, I&apos;m convinced. Do you believe you are being courageous by pushing the boundaries of business and sustainability? I have a very fortunate situation in that a lot of risks around me are taken away by the sheer size of Unilever, by our culture and heritage. So I have a lot of safety nets around me. The real heroes are the ones who actually do more but don&apos;t have that. And there are many of those. I just get a disproportionate share of voice, perhaps. How important is transparency in driving change? It is about building trust and for this trust you need leaders who are very comfortable with transparency. We said to Barbara Stocking before she left Oxfam, why don&apos;t you just go to Vietnam and do the whole social audit of our supply chain? We have 200,000 suppliers and audit 20,000 suppliers, probably more than any other company, but there&apos;s a capacity limit to that, otherwise you go bankrupt. We published Oxfam&apos;s report, which included criticisms, and we say this is a great thing because it helps us be better and it helps Vietnam be better. You didn&apos;t see the press jumping on us. You didn&apos;t see people saying that Unilever was irresponsible. In fact I&apos;d argue perhaps the opposite. So you create this transparency that builds this trust, which ultimately is the basis for prosperity. What is the role of partnerships in finding solutions to the complex problems we face? I&apos;m not a CEO who has actually much power to be honest. I have a convening power, but I use that to find the right partnerships so all the time I bring in new partnerships to the company and then there are many specialists who know much better what to do. It&apos;s a different way of working. When I was chairing the Food Security Taskforce for the B20, the NGOs brought in a lot of things I&apos;d never thought about. We would not have talked about land rights if Barbara Stocking had not insisted on land rights, which now sounds so obvious. We would not have put the focus on women in agriculture and small farming, which now everybody is preaching about, but that was already two years ago on our recommendations. So it becomes much richer. And as the business community also educates itself around that, you get solutions that are much better. How important is it that leaders can work with uncertainty? These are very difficult times; it&apos;s very uncertain going forward. You get currencies that go up and down 20%, you get markets that shift very rapidly. So you need to have people who can feel comfortable dealing with a Vuca world \u2013 volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. The problem is, you talk food security and you hear many different solutions. Some say: how can you have food security if girls cannot go to school? While others say: if I don&apos;t have energy, I can&apos;t have food security. Or, we need to have water because otherwise we don&apos;t have food. Then a CEO goes, oh my gosh, how do I participate in this? So what you need is leaders who are able to take this complexity and distil it in simplicity, and are actually able to drive that to action. That&apos;s a skill that you have to learn. I&apos;m not good at it either, to be honest, but now we have created some ecosystems, the global Consumer Goods Forum, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and WEF which are able to turn that into a positive flywheel that creates momentum. How important is diversity and inclusiveness in driving business transformation? It&apos;s all about the way we value things. If you look at the female brain, it&apos;s differently developed from the male brain; there is a better balance between the left and the right side. So there is more empathy, more purpose, longer-term thinking, more partnership and a sense of equality, a better understanding and listening skills than men. So the skills you need to be more successful in the future probably are more in the female than they are in the male. For that reason you need to be sure that you have a very diverse organisation. How is it possible to move business culture away from a &quot;winner takes all&quot; mentality? It&apos;s important to understand the difference between values and culture because people mix them up. In terms of culture, nearly 60% of our business is in the emerging markets, and that is obviously around 90% of our growth, so it&apos;s going to be around 80% of the total before I retire. But if our culture is the European or American male MBA, it&apos;s not going to last. This is why we deliberately put our major training centre in Singapore. We deliberately put women, by the way not a problem in that part of the world, into senior management positions. You have to think about it as a CEO because you have to prepare the company for the future. One of the reasons we abolished the quarterly profit is not just to be cute and save a few days for quarterly reporting, but to send a clear signal that we are going to do well all the time. Do you ever feel that people think that you&apos;ve gone a bit soft in the head? Well, they might or not, I leave that to others to judge, but the best thing we can do is to show that the way we are trying to be responsible also makes good business sense and I don&apos;t think there is any question about that. To pay a textile worker in Pakistan 11 cents an hour doesn&apos;t make good business sense. We had a lot of cost pressures before I came and the business also wasn&apos;t doing that well. We had a lot of contingent labour or we outsourced it and we looked at that as a cost item but we had a tremendous amount of turnover. Now we pay more and we have greater loyalty, more energy and higher productivity. Do you feel you need to pay attention to the fluctuations in your share price? I don&apos;t get excited about the share price because I think it&apos;s something you don&apos;t control. Once you have the results, the share price will be what it is: affected by the state of the global economy, which sector is in vogue and all the other things. But if you can look at it over the last four or five years, we have given anybody that invested in Unilever a more than acceptable return versus other vehicles. Do you feel as a result of the recent profits warning there will be pressure on you from investors to refocus on short-term performance? When we look at our overall business, we continue to grow our markets and we are still on course to deliver against our priorities of profitable volume growth ahead of our markets, steady and sustainable core operating margin improvement and strong cashflow. We cannot so precisely control our sales in any 90-day period and if we did, we would probably be making the wrong decisions for the longer term health of the business. How do you stop yourself from getting overwhelmed by the problems facing the world? You need to have an enormous discipline that you are not going to try to solve all the issues that are out there but that you stay focused on the things that you as your business, who you ultimately represent, can make the biggest impact. So, for us, it is issues like food security, sanitation and deforestation. We focus on issues that also accelerate our business because we provide solutions. If it&apos;s hygiene then we have a Lifebuoy for hand wash, if it&apos;s women&apos;s self-esteem we have Dove, so every brand becomes a cause, a social movement in that sense. But I think the main thing is to have a firm belief about the core responsibility of solving these challenges, and not delegating that to someone else. If you don&apos;t have that inside of you, then we can all sit here and be critical about government and legislation, but where are you in this? You cannot be a bystander in the system that gives you life in the first place. Now, it is a very important thing to understand what these words mean, what is that life in the first place and what is the bystander? The role of business has to be firmly understood by the CEO down, that it is there to serve the broader society, the common good and only by doing that very well you will be rewarded, but it has to start there and end there. That is the clear focus we have lost in many CEOs, in many businesses. That is not to be critical, just to be factual. It&apos;s very hard for people in the financial community now to give you a really motivational speech about what their purpose is in society and yet it is so obvious what it should be and what it could be. What is the purpose of finance companies? Well, obviously it is about being an enabler versus an end in itself; adding true value for society versus creating your own value at the expense of others. For example, we are working on ending deforestation. The banks can play an enormous role, to say: I lend money to responsible companies that only do sustainable sourcing and I don&apos;t lend to others that don&apos;t. You would expect now some of the major financial institutions to play a more proactive role in helping with the challenges that we have. So you are saying they have a clear purpose if they want it? Exactly, if they want it. We compared the salaries in the City with our salaries, and we are one third and yet the City is saying: oh, the changes with bonus and salaries, I cannot attract the right people. Nobody really asks the right questions, why can&apos;t you attract the right people? Is it because you&apos;re not paying enough or because the purpose has disappeared out of your business model? And there are too many in some of these industries that are still driven by their own incentive system.

It was the only country where people compared teachers most closely to doctors, with the majority of places opting for social-workers, and in the case of the US, Brazil, France and Turkey, librarians. The UK and the US ranked in the middle of the Global Teacher Status Index, and were beaten by South Korea, Turkey, Egypt and Greece, which all valued their teachers more than any European or Anglo Saxon country. Israel was at the bottom of the index, which was based on a survey of 21 countries. The index, written by Professor Peter Dolton and Dr Oscar Marcenaro-Gutierrez, is the first comprehensive attempt to compare the status of teachers across the world and is published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation. In each country, 1,000 people were asked about whether teacher earnings were fair, if they&apos;d encourage their own children to become teachers and whether unions had too much power. Below, we&apos;ve pulled out some of the most interesting findings below. 1. The status of headteachers is higher in the UK than in any of the other countries polled. 2. Parents in China, South Korea, Turkey and Egypt are most likely to give encouragement to children to become teachers. Whereas parents in Israel, Portugal, Brazil and Japan are least likely to provide positive encouragement. The UK scored in the middle. 3. Teacher salaries are at their highest in Singapore, with an average of $45,755. South Korea, USA, Germany and Japan are all above $40,000. The UK is at $33,377.  4. People in 95% of the countries polled support a higher salary for teachers than they currently earn. However, Japan, France and US judge that teacher pay is between 6% and 55% higher than is considered fair. 5. Across Europe there are higher levels of pessimism on students&apos; respect for teachers than in Asia and the Middle East. In China 75% of respondents believe that students respect teachers, compared to an average of 27% per country. 6. In all 21 countries, more than 59% of people think teachers ought to be paid according to the performance of their pupils. The average across countries was 75%. 7. Opinion was divided on the influence teaching unions have over teacher&apos;s pay and conditions. In the UK, and in many European countries, the majority of people support unions having a greater influence. However, countries where there is the most recent history of teacher unrest \u2013 such as Japan, Greece, France and the US \u2013 believe unions have too much influence. 8. In the UK, the actual wage of teachers is lower than what people perceive to be fair. Respondents thought teachers ought to be awarded pay that is 15% more than current teacher wages. Some 74% of respondents thought teachers should be paid according to their pupils&apos; results. 9. Finland, Switzerland and Singapore have the most faith in their education system, and South Korea, Egypt and Japan have the least. The UK comes seventh. 10. Teachers are given satisfactory or positive trust ratings in every country polled. The average trust rating is 6.3 out of 10 and no country gave a rating below five. Finland and Brazil have the most trust in their teachers. While Israel, South Korea, Egypt and Japan hold the least.  This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Tony Abbott&apos;s government has been in power for just a few weeks, yet in that short time he&apos;s already undone years of work on a host of environmental and climate change priorities. He said he would in the election, and he has. For instance, he&apos;s initiated the legislative process to get rid of Australia&apos;s carbon tax. The Climate Change Authority  \u2013 which determines the cap on emissions of greenhouse gases \u2013 the principal independent climate research body, and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation are all to be abolished. All around Australia, big business is gearing up for a new gold rush in terms of mining, minerals extraction, housing and tourism development. As he made clear in his campaign, he cares nothing for the environment, and believes that man-made climate change is an elaborate confection of lies, illusions and flaky science. From a sustainability perspective, the Dark Ages beckon. Before Australia, I was in Singapore, where the contrast could hardly be greater. Precisely because it has few natural resources of its own, Singapore has always prioritised water and energy efficiency. It has strict environmental standards and planning regulations, and its excellent Economic Development Board has a focus on the green economy, bringing together many of the world&apos;s leading companies to get involved in a host of new, highly innovative collaborations. I ended up launching my new book in two contrasting contexts. Where Australia is heading rapidly backwards into a dogma-driven, scientifically illiterate world of development at literally all costs, Singapore is intent on seizing hold of a very different kind of future. The World We Made is written from the vantage point of 2050, looking back to tell the story of how we got from where we are today (in one hell of a lot of trouble, both environmentally and socially) to be living in a fair, high-tech and genuinely sustainable world by 2050. It celebrates the genius of the scientists, engineers, activists and entrepreneurs whose breakthroughs and courage made this world possible. And it&apos;s absolutely not science fiction. I&apos;ve spent a huge amount of time over the past couple of years delving into the innovation pipeline for all the key technology areas on which our sustainable future depends: energy, water, waste management, land use, resources and so on. Practically everything we need to fashion a sustainable world for nine billion people is either out there, on the drawing board or in the lab. And the pace of change is extraordinary; the wealth creating potential quite staggering. But without the political will to get all that financed and deployed \u2013 at a massive scale, in the shortest period of time possible, all around the world \u2013 the pipeline stays locked. If I needed any reminding, being in Australia at this particular time confirmed in spades that the prospects for a sustainable world depend more on the quality of leadership and vision than on the availability of new technology. Blessed with astonishing natural resources, many people in Australia have become complacent and arrogant. All those who voted for Tony Abbott must somehow believe that the current model of progress (which basically depends on selling off the country&apos;s resources to China) will last forever. They must further have been able to persuade themselves that the harsh evidence of accelerating climate change in Australia today (in terms of severe droughts, bush fires, freak storms, flash floods, rising sea levels etc etc) is nonsense. It feels as if the future has just been cancelled. Time for Plan B. The World We Made isn&apos;t just about technology; it&apos;s about political protest and the power of the internet to transform people&apos;s lives. It&apos;s about a new generation of inspired business leaders who seek to fill the void vacated by blind, bigoted politicians. It&apos;s about religious and faith leaders, waking up to the true meaning of what all their sacred texts tell us about stewardship, justice and personal responsibility. This is not a case of reckless optimism triumphing over the reality of continuing political failure \u2013 let alone over the apparent indifference of the majority of people as we further erode the political foundations on which our lives depend. After 40 years banging away at this particular drum, I have few illusions left on either count. But as the proof points multiply, they show there&apos;s a far better way of meeting our needs and following our dreams - purposeful, action-oriented hope is still our most important resource.

In fact, in recent years it&apos;s become a truism that attracting good quality and well-qualified people into teaching is accepted as the essential prerequisite to raising educational standards. In Finland and Singapore, teachers are recruited from the most-qualified graduates, all with a second degree. One obvious way these countries have attracted the best and brightest into teaching is by paying them well. As I have established in my previous research, there is a demonstrable link between the level of teachers&apos; salaries in a country and their educational track record. But the influence of teacher status \u2013 the social and cultural forces that determine how much we respect teachers \u2013 are harder to measure. However, it is vital that we try and do so since the cleverest graduates, in demand from the best employers, will not want to join a profession that is publicly denigrated or seen as a second-best option for graduates. Governments that are serious about attracting the best people into teaching must look seriously at the status of teachers \u2013 alongside other factors such as their salaries. There have been many international comparisons of educational performance such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). But teacher status has never been examined in any comprehensive way. It&apos;s common for people to remember a vanished age when teachers were respected, or feel that their own country alone has stopped giving teachers the respect they deserve. But until now there has been very little evidence to substantiate these perceptions. The Varkey GEMS Foundation, aware of this gap, commissioned me to oversee the 2013 Global Teacher Status Index, the first large-scale international comparison of the status of teachers. Some 21,000 people were polled across 21 Asian, European, South American and Middle Eastern countries with the same questions. To gauge the social standing of teachers we asked people to rank teachers against other professions such as doctors, lawyers and librarians. We asked a question that goes to the heart of attitudes towards teachers: would you encourage your own child to become a teacher? We also asked how much, in a fair world, teacher should be paid. This survey evidence was then condensed into the index, with rankings for each of the 21 countries surveyed. The results were not entirely predictable. Teachers had the highest status in China and Greece and the lowest in Israel and Brazil. Most European countries including the UK and the US ranked halfway down the index. However, the UK came higher on the teacher status index than most other European countries \u2013 including Finland \u2013 as well as other countries with a similar GDP per capita such as Germany and France. Its secondary school teachers had the highest status of every other European country polled. Like most other countries surveyed, Britons were most likely to compare teachers to nurses and social workers and around a quarter would encourage their child to become a teacher \u2013 which, though low, is a higher proportion than German, France and Finland. So why do the UK&apos;s teachers have a comparatively high status compared to other European countries? This is hard to be definitive about but UK teachers do earn more than in many European countries \u2013 including Italy, Portugal, Spain and France. Secondly, UK education has focused heavily on targets in recent years so there is general understanding in Britain that teaching has become a very demanding job. Finally, the relative success of Britain compared to others in Europe could be more to do with the unhappy mood of our neighbours. France and Germany have had intense public debates about the quality of their education systems that may have adversely affected the status of teachers. In both countries after performed disappointingly in the PISA rankings, there was a bout of national naval-gazing about education standards that we haven&apos;t had in the UK. In the UK, the status of headteachers was higher than in any other country. This is perhaps because in the UK over the last few years we have had the phenomenon of the &apos;super head&apos; and seen headteachers as agents of change in the education system. This is different to the culture in other countries where headteachers are seen more as administrators than pedagogical leaders. In most countries surveyed there was a clear pecking order: headteachers were respected most, followed by secondary school teachers and then primary school teachers. (Though not in France, China, Turkey and the US \u2013 where primary school teachers were respected more than their secondary school colleagues). In most countries, the public felt that teachers should have higher salaries \u2013 though there were exceptions. France, the US and Japan thought that they should be paid less. At least half of all people polled supported performance related pay for teachers. In two thirds of the countries surveyed, teachers were most likely to be compared to social workers. Interestingly, in the US teachers were most often compared to librarians \u2013 perhaps because libraries are located next to schools in many middle American towns. These comparisons show that there is a lot of progress to be made before teachers are thought of in the same bracket as lawyers and doctors. But the starkest differences were between Eastern countries and the West. Apart from the sole exception of Greece, teachers in China, South Korea, Egypt, Turkey and Singapore had a higher status than every country surveyed in Europe and the US. In European countries, between 10 and 25% of people tended to think that pupils respected teachers \u2013 compared to 75% in China. Fewer than 20% of Germans would encourage their child to become a teacher compared to nearly 50% of Chinese people. Out of all the countries surveyed, only Chinese people tended to compare teachers with doctors. Here, cultural issues seem to be at work. Teaching is treated with reverence in Asian societies \u2013 especially in China. The findings also have an important message for governments in these times of austerity. There is no clear link to be found between teacher status and pupil outcomes. A large part of the reason for this is that occupational status is indistinguishable from remuneration in some countries, whereas it is entirely distinct from pay in other countries. The upshot of these findings is that governments cannot expect that improving the status of teachers will lead to better pupil outcomes in the absence of well-remunerated teachers. Presenting teaching as a vocation whose rewards are to be had from social respect alone is doomed to fail. There is no free lunch for governments that want teachers to do more for less. However \u2013 this is not necessarily a straightforward demand to increase the pay of all existing teachers. What we want is for many of our most able graduates to enter the profession who will be able to get the best from pupils. We will only be able to attract them if teaching is seen as both a highly paid and high-status profession. My own view is that in the UK we won&apos;t improve the status of teachers unless teaching is recognised as a profession. Lawyers and doctors have their own professional bodies such as the Law Society and the General Medical Council. These organisations represent their professions but also regulate the conduct of their members. If a doctor is found to have compromised professional standards, the GMC can take sanctions against them. These bodies are therefore respected by the public in a way that unions are not, because they are seen as being on the side of the public. Others will have different ideas for how to raise the status of teaching. By publishing the 2013 Global Teacher Status Index, we hope to encourage such debates \u2013 from education ministries to staff rooms \u2013 about how we bring about the transformation in teacher status that the next generation need, and teachers themselves deserve.

But those are figures this circuit will not equal, even on race day. Largely unloved, it seems, in Korea and possibly now unwanted, the future of the Korean Grand Prix remains in doubt before this weekend&apos;s race. The circuit remains listed as a provisional date on an already packed 2014 calendar which currently includes 22 races and has yet to negotiate a return next year with Bernie Ecclestone. Ironically the track is popular with many drivers because of its grippy surface and the lack of sponsor-based work they have to do here, with the sunshine and pleasing scenery adding to the mix. But the lack of fan support is an issue. The swathes of empty grandstands that could happily seat thousands are noticeable, with Lewis Hamilton rather cuttingly observing: &quot;You just have to try and draw inspiration from the empty seats. They could at least put cardboard cut-outs of people in there, so you could look out at them \u2026&quot; His former team-mate Jenson Button also bemoaned the lack of support for the venue, which is three-and-a-half hours from Seoul. &quot;It&apos;s always sad when there are no fans at a race because they make for the atmosphere,&quot; he said. &quot;The sport wouldn&apos;t exist if it wasn&apos;t for them.&quot; Now in its fourth year, the race&apos;s location is not enough alone to explain the relatively poor numbers that attend. Spa is a four to five-hour drive from Calais \u2013 and Le Mans even further \u2013 yet British and other European fans attend both events in their thousands. Quite why Formula One has yet to take any grip on the consciousness of the Korean public and whether it will in future is something the organisers will be asking while looking to renew their contract. Equally, the sheer number of proposed races on next year&apos;s calendar may yet pose a threat to the race continuing. The man responsible for the logistics of shifting Ferrari&apos;s equipment across the globe, the team manager, Massimo Rivola, said in reference to the currently proposed triumvirate of races at Monaco, New Jersey and Montreal, with only one week between each, that: &quot;It&apos;s going to be almost impossible to do it. To be honest, I&apos;m still hoping we come back to the 20 races as per the current sporting regulation.

Indeed, earlier in the week the team were batting away speculation that their car may be breaking the rules, especially after Vettel&apos;s performance at the last race in Singapore but here they simply reconfirmed that the other teams are merely playing catch-up. He had also been quickest in the morning&apos;s final practice session after Hamilton topped both Friday&apos;s runs and now starts from the best possible position on a circuit that is tricky for overtaking, although the rain predicted for the afternoon may yet play a role and Vettel&apos;s rivals will be hoping for anything that might bring them closer to him. Vettel, running on the option super-soft tyres, led the opening of Q3 with a time of 1.37.202, two-tenths clear of team-mate Mark Webber and then the German went out last, the best position from which to watch his opponents for the final quick lap and they could not oust him. Despite moving up a position on his second run, Hamilton could come no closer than two-tenths to Vettel, whose time remained the quickest as he saved his tyres and cruised into the pits at the end of the lap.

But although the Nigerian army and navy were stationed just 100 metres from the site of the massive explosion, no one knows \u2013 or will say \u2013 what really happened to Nigeria&apos;s most important oil pipeline around 2am on 19 June. It could have been an accident. The Trans Niger pipeline, which transports around 150,000 barrels a day of crude oil from wells across the Niger delta through the creeks and impoverished villages of Ogoniland and Ogu-Bolo to the giant oil terminal at Bonney, is rusting, nearly 50 years old and known to spring leaks. But it is also one of the most sabotaged pipelines in the world with local communities accused by Shell of making over 20 attempts to tap oil from it in the last year. Company contractors had been repairing one section of the pipeline when the explosion happened but the official investigation team believes that the accident followed a botched attempt to steal tens of thousands of barrels of crude oil. Even as one group of engineers was removing illegal taps on the line, another group is thought to have been installing equipment to allow huge amounts of oil to be siphoned straight into large barges where it would be taken out to sea to waiting tankers bound for Europe and the US. &quot;From the moment I got to the scene [the next day] I was suspicious,&quot; says Catholic priest Father Obi, appointed by Shell to be an official observer for the Bodo investigation. &quot;The scene had been hurriedly deserted. Shell must have known what was going on. The military must have known. Everyone knew there was complicity. I am personally sure that Shell knew that its oil was being stolen. If the managers did not know, then those who they put in charge [of the operation]seemed to know. This [theft] could not have happened without the collusion of the authorities and the military.&quot; Obi is concerned that the official report has still not been published and is threatening to release his own. It all adds up to organised crime stealing oil using the cover of the authorities, he says. &quot;Why was a massive barge able to hold 10,000 barrels of oil being loaded at 2am with crude? Why did another catch fire? Why were excavators there? Why were local observers arrested the next day, their cameras confiscated and memory cards destroyed? Were the thieves being protected by the military? Was the company paying workers to clean up oil spilled in the process of theft they themselves were engaged in? Did Shell know its oil was being stolen from under its nose?&quot; he asks. In a statement, Shell accepted its oil was being stolen when the accident happened but strongly denied any collusion or knowledge of who might be responsible. Shell Nigeria&apos;s managing director, Mutiu Sunmonu, said: &quot;Unknown persons continued to reconnect illegal bunkering hoses at Bodo West even as our pipeline team were removing crude theft points.&quot; But the company has yet to make public its own investigation. &quot;We are not aware of any direct involvement [in the Bodo explosion] but we would take legal action if anything was discovered,&quot; adds a spokesman for the company in Port Harcourt. &quot;One has to understand there is this accusation that the oil industry employees are behind this, but there are thousands of people who have the skills who may have been working with the industry over the years. These people are outside and some of them may be for hire. There is a sophisticated organisation, clearly it is not just local. There has to be a wide network,&quot; says Philip Mshelbila, head of Shell communications in Lagos. The Bodo explosion is significant because it shows how oil theft in Nigeria has reached an industrial scale. It is now undermining Africa&apos;s second-biggest economy and ranks with the drugs trade as the most lucrative crime in the world. According to President Goodluck Jonathan, 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil per day, or more than 10% of all Nigeria&apos;s production, is being lost at a cost to the state and oil companies of around \u00a31bn a month \u2013 more than is spent on education and the health of the nation&apos;s 168 million people. Not only is Nigerian oil theft helping to keep the world price of oil high, it is causing corruption and social disorder, says the president. &quot;The figures are huge. [Oil theft]could destabilise Nigeria. The business is worth billions of dollars a year. It is on an industrial scale, and involves commodity traders, international [criminals] and a whole network of people. There are some allegations that the oil companies themselves are implicated,&quot; says presidential aide Ken Saro-Wiwa, whose father, along with other Ogoni chiefs, was executed in 1995 after a peaceful protest against Shell. Mshelbila says: &quot;We [Shell] are losing 40-60,000 barrels of oil a day. This is just what we know is stolen from the trunk lines. We have to shut down lines, so, taken together it&apos;s probably 300,000-400,000 barrels a day. We are seeing more illegal connections, more frequent shutdowns than one year ago.&quot; According to a report from the foreign affairs thinktank Chatham House, oil is being stolen not just from pipelines but from tank farms, export terminals, refinery storage tanks, jetties, ports, pipelines, and wellheads. &quot;Officials and private actors disguise theft through manipulation of meters and shipping documents. Proceeds are laundered through world financial centres and used to buy assets in and outside Nigeria, polluting markets and financial institutions overseas, and creating reputational, political and legal hazards,&quot; it says. Much of the stolen oil is exported to foreign refineries or storage facilities, says the report, including buyers in West Africa, the US, Brazil, China, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Balkans. The proceeds appear to be laundered through banks and other channels in various African countries, Dubai, Indonesia, India, Singapore, the US, the UK, and Switzerland. The scale of the &quot;bunkering&quot; has shocked observers. Thirty centimetre pipelines able to transport thousands of barrels of oil a day have been found leading straight from pipelines into the swamps. The Nigerian navy had to sack two admirals for their role in the disappearance of a tanker that had been seized for transporting 11,000 tonnes of stolen crude. &quot;A lot of big-time stealing goes on. You know the oil you are offered is stolen,&quot; says one oil trader in Port Harcourt who asks to remain anonymous. &quot;They give it to you without documents at a cheaper rate. I was offered 50,000 litres today for 55 naira (20p) a litre. But 75 nairais the cheapest you can get it from the government. You know it&apos;s a racket. There is no chance of getting caught because there is no system to catch people. Big business is big politics.&quot; He alleges that the Nigerian military has become deeply implicated in oil theft since an amnesty was declared with militants two years ago. &quot;The military now control the oil platforms, not the militants. People now have to buy oil directly from the military. The military is a chain of command, so I can only assume this goes to the very top. Oil theft used to be about people breaking into pipes. That is not happening any more. If I want to load 200 tonnes of crude, I would have to pay for a lot of security. It is far easier to go straight to the military.&quot; Most of the oil is being stolen by the rich, he says. &quot;It is dishonest for government and the oil companies to blame the poor for stealing the oil. The people in the communities are just the foot soldiers. Clearly this is a sophisticated organisation. Where do people get vessels, the money for bribes and security? It costs millions. What the poor take is very small. The racket goes deep into the security and political systems. Tens of thousands of tonnes of oil is being spirited away every week. All the authorities are involved \u2013 the oil companies, the military, the politicians. There&apos;s plenty of money to be made so everyone is in it.&quot; Research by delta non-government group Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) estimates that 75% of the stolen oil is being exported with the rest being refined in illegal &quot;artisanal refineries&quot;. More than 500 of these are known to have been set up in the last five years, taking stolen crude and refining it into a rough diesel for local sale. According to SDN, a medium-sized illegal refinery costs around \u00a33,000 to set up but can earn that back in a few weeks. But the operators need to pay hefty bribes to the police and military, as well as to buy oil tapped off the 1,600km of pipelines that cross the delta. Each tapping point, says SDN, can earn more than \u00a3500,000 a month but its investors must pay armed guards, the military, contractors, local communities and even oil company staff. Delta communities freely admit their role in the theft of oil but blame continuing poverty and pollution for their actions. &quot;The government and oil companies are collecting our oil and we don&apos;t have jobs, or money so we have to collect the oil and refine our own,&quot; says a man in the village of Bolo near where an illegal refinery was set up five years ago. Bolo leaders admit that the military was paid off. &quot;When the refinery was working it used to refine around 10,000 litres of oil a day. It could only operate with the help of the police and military, The pay-off system to the armed forces and police was well organised. It was a plum posting for the military here. Most army have a lifestyle that you cannot explain,&quot; says Mela Oforibika, a lawyer and chief of the Bolo community. &quot;This place was booming. Every house was rented out. Thirty people had jobs. Young men came in who knew the art of distillation. What moral right did I have to stop them? It brought us money. The bars were full, the economy benefited.&quot; But the pollution from the illegal refineries was extreme because no one knew how to safely dispose of the waste residues from the diesel-making process. The Bolo refinery on the small island of Odokian was raided by the military five months ago, possibly because the consortium who owned it refused to pay the authorities for protection. Today, the four-acre site stinks of oil and may never recover. It is saturated with waste oil, the palm trees are blackened by fire and there are no fish in the waterways. Rusting pipes, burned-out oil drums and old metal tanks litter several acres of what was lush farmland. Community chiefs blame the oil companies and government for the pollution rather than the refiners. &quot;There&apos;s a heavy level of unemployment here. People knew what was happening to the environment, but what is the alternative for the young men? The illegal refineries were set up as a direct result of the wickedness of Shell and the oil companies who polluted the waterways and never compensated us. The refineries have been destroyed but they will come back. How long can you keep armies to police these communities? We would never have allowed these [refineries] to come into our area if we had been properly compensated before,&quot; says Boma Ipiurima Asitonka, a Bolo teacher. &quot;You cannot abandon people like this. If there was work here, no one would have made this pollution,&quot; says Oisiekel Tubomie, chief of Bolo youth council. The only solution to oil theft is to give people a stake in the oil, say the chiefs. &quot;We propose that the government sets up and licenses legal, mini-refineries in dozens of villages and sells them oil at cost price so they can profit, provide jobs and diesel for the communities. It would destroy the criminality and end the pollution,&quot; says Oforibika. But this is not an option for the oil companies, who must operate in an increasingly volatile environment bristling with guns. Shell plans to spend \u00a31bn building a new, more secure loop for the Trans Niger pipeline to bypass Ogoniland and areas where its present one is regularly sabotaged. &quot;If the government and the oil companies spent a fraction of what they lose to theft on developing the delta communities, they would not have these problems of theft. As it stands, the oil industry is run by a very small elite for a very few people. If nothing changes, the future here is bleak,&quot; says Oforibika. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 October 2013 to correct the name of the delta non-government group\u2022 This article was amended on 9 October to clarify that Shell is losing 40-60,000 barrels a day, not 60-80,000 as previously stated"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/sebastian-vettel-korean-grand-prix", "sentences": ["This was his fourth consecutive win and he made a similar charge at a similar time last year, taking four in a row with Singapore, Japan, Korea and India."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-06T22:53:00Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel cruises to another victory at Korean Grand Prix", "tags": ["Formula One 2013", "Red Bull", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport", "Lewis Hamilton"], "article": "At least there was no booing from the fans for Sebastian Vettel on Sunday after he had completed another unruffled trip to the chequered flag. It will certainly not concern him that, well, there were not that many spectators to witness him move to within touching distance of a fourth consecutive world championship. He will be aware that the title will put him among the greats \u2013 only Juan Manuel Fangio and Michael Schumacher have also won four in a row, but the sport might yet be troubled by his dominance, especially if he wraps up the title at the next race in Japan. After taking the flag in Yeongam, that he will take the title seems inevitable. He can do it at Suzuka with a victory allied to Fernando Alonso finishing outside the top eight. But if not there, then surely soon. This was his fourth consecutive win and he made a similar charge at a similar time last year, taking four in a row with Singapore, Japan, Korea and India. At the end of that sequence his lead over Alonso was only 13 points \u2013 it is now 77. When, not if, then and while the team principal, Christian Horner, is not expecting Red Bull to do it in Japan, he is unequivocal in his praise for the champion-in-waiting. Asked whether people might put Vettel in the same bracket as Fangio and Schumacher, he responded: &quot;Should he win four titles in a row, they will have to.&quot; The &quot;should&quot; was politic more than anything as he added that Vettel would, indeed, be alongside the greats. &quot;He has got to be right up there, he has got to be,&quot; he said. &quot;The level that he is performing at is unbelievable in many respects. What has been really impressive is that he has continued to grow and get better as he has gained more experience. To have won the ratio of races he has is remarkable.&quot; That ratio is 34 wins from 115 starts, and character has been crucial, argues Horner. &quot;He is hugely self-critical,&quot; he said. &quot;He is always looking at areas where he can improve. He&apos;ll look at this race and look at areas where he could have been stronger. It is that inward-looking [approach] that keeps propelling him forward.&quot; That inexorable motion has put him in an extraordinary position, but while fans may like to see a closer fight it would be churlish to deny his skill. Certainly he has the best car but Mark Webber, who has been pedalling the same Red Bull alongside Vettel for the three championships he has won already, only really came close in 2010. Perhaps of more concern is that such dominance can be off-putting. Vettel is not only being mentioned alongside Schumacher in reference to his titles but now also to the period of the latter&apos;s pre-eminince when, of his seven world championships, five were won consecutively for Ferrari between 2000 and 2004. Indeed Lewis Hamilton, who made another feisty push to only yield a fifth place, noted a comparison between the two German drivers. &quot;Personally I feel for the fan because I remember the period when Michael Schumacher was winning,&quot; he said. &quot;I remember waking up in the morning to watch the start of the race, going back to sleep, and then waking up when it ended, because I already knew what would happen. I am pretty sure a lot of people were doing that today.&quot; Which is a fair comment. There are few fans of any sport who would not prefer to see a nail-biting fight, but part of that equation is the opposition providing the challenge and at the moment they simply cannot match Red Bull. Instead tyres have again become a talking point in the dirty air behind Vettel&apos;s acceleration to the title, particularly after Sergio P\u00e9rez&apos;s right-front delaminated mid-race here. Earlier in the weekend Alonso&apos;s criticism of the rubber was met cuttingly by Pirelli&apos;s Paul Hembery saying: &quot;I can only suggest he goes to ask the soon-to-be four-times champion how to get the best from the same tyres.&quot; A remark for which he subsequently apologised. But Alonso continued on Sunday, stating: &quot;We know the tyres are on the limit in terms of quality.&quot; To which Webber added: &quot;Pirelli will put the puncture of P\u00e9rez down to a lock-up but the reason the drivers are locking up is because there&apos;s no tread left.&quot; Yet Pirelli, which has come in for so much criticism this season, is merely doing what was asked of it, providing rubber offering more stops and more strategy decisions. Indeed, Alonso acknowledged this amid his critique. &quot;These are tyres that won&apos;t last a lap, but as we said on Saturday, we have zero problems with the performance,&quot; he noted. &quot;It&apos;s us who haven&apos;t adapted to these 2012 tyres. It&apos;s up to us Ferrari, or the drivers, to improve.&quot; Which is another fair point, certainly to Pirelli. The tyres are, after all, the same for everybody and it is up to the teams to maximise performance. Vettel and Red Bull have done so and that is why they go to Japan with the chance of clinching the championship there, as they did in 2011. But for Vettel, the job in hand remains. &quot;Our target is to win the championship,&quot; he said. &quot;Not to win it in one place in particular.&quot; The focus that Horner so admires and that has brought his driver to the very fringe of joining an extraordinarily exclusive club."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/oct/08/professional-development-learn-schools-abroad", "sentences": ["Dudley explains: &quot;In Singapore, for instance, they&apos;ve been putting a lot of money into developing lesson studies because their analysis shows that they are very good at producing highly-skilled mathematicians and scientists, but not so good at producing people who have left-field, problem-solving skills \u2013 creative thinkers."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-08T06:00:00Z", "title": "Professional development: what can Brits learn from schools abroad?", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching", "Teacher training", "Secondary schools", "Primary schools"], "article": "With each new government comes a fresh-faced education minister, eager to make their mark on schools. In the UK, it often seems it is politicians, not teachers, who make decisions about what children should learn \u2013 and how. But it&apos;s not like that everywhere. In some countries, continual professional development (CPD) for teachers is considered so strong and successful that it&apos;s easier for teaching practices to evolve internally. And although focus on CPD may be relatively new in the UK, it&apos;s been important for decades elsewhere. In the 1870s, teachers in Japan started collaborating and analysing each others&apos; lessons. It became known as the Lesson Study model, but was kept a well-hidden secret; it reached China in the 1950s, but it wasn&apos;t until the 1990s that it went truly international. Since then it&apos;s been held up as a shining example of CPD&apos;s potential. &quot;The model in Japan is that you&apos;ll be a member of a lesson study group throughout your career,&quot; says Pete Dudley, who heads up Lesson Study UK. &quot;Most Japanese teachers will be involved with one lesson study a year. &quot;You identify an issue you want to tackle, and you research it as a group, evaluating the materials you normally use. You design a lesson and one of you teaches it, while the others watch very carefully to see how the children are responding. In Japan, making your lessons public is expected. It&apos;s the norm,&quot; he adds. It&apos;s a culture that many teachers are not used to in the UK. Dudley admits: &quot;In this country, people often feel quite vulnerable teaching in front of each other. Lesson Study is less self-conscious and more collaborative.&quot; The hope behind the system is that increased collaboration will help teachers improve and encourage them to share ideas. Dudley explains: &quot;In Singapore, for instance, they&apos;ve been putting a lot of money into developing lesson studies because their analysis shows that they are very good at producing highly-skilled mathematicians and scientists, but not so good at producing people who have left-field, problem-solving skills \u2013 creative thinkers. &quot;So they needed to change their default mode of teaching,&quot; he continues. &quot;They adopted Lesson Study as the modal for professional development because every time you ask the same question: how can we help these children learn X better?&quot; But what lessons can we take about professional development from abroad? Would Lesson Studies work in the UK? Dave Goode, assistant principle of Samuel Whitbread Academy in Bedfordshire, says it does. Goode introduced the system to his school despite facing &quot;quite a lot of negativity&quot; from staff. The system needs to be carefully planned \u2013 timetables and teaching cover have to be altered to allow for collaborative sessions. But the efforts have been worth it, Goode says, and the model has brought a change of culture. &quot;What is intrinsic to it is the re-professionalising of teachers,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s focused around teacher professionalism and trust.&quot; But if it&apos;s professional and collaborative culture that&apos;s important, does the CPD framework need to be as formal as lesson studies? Do British schools need to copy the Japanese framework? Phil Taylor, education academic at Birmingham City University, travelled to Finland to study CPD. Like Japan, the country has been praised for its advanced CPD and last year was top of Pearson&apos;s international education rankings. The CPD model is much less formal than the Japanese lesson studies, Taylor says. &quot;The differences are cultural, and deeply rooted, rather than systematic or policy driven, particularly in terms of teacher CPD.&quot; The Japanese system, in contrast, &quot;often involves as many observers to a classroom as there are pupils, leading to an unnatural, laboratory lesson.&quot; He adds: &quot;In Finland, there are high levels of professional trust and autonomy in a system not constrained by top-down, high-stakes accountability. Professional responsibility to colleagues, parents and pupils is strong. There is also an emphasis on high quality, university-based training and a research/enquiry orientation to practice development.&quot; But if Britain wants to replicate Finland&apos;s success, it needs to reconsider its professional culture; both Finland&apos;s and Japan&apos;s CPD relies on the development of mutually-supportive environments for teachers. &quot;Teachers I met in Finland were genuinely shocked when I spoke of the routine grading and judging of UK teachers,&quot; says Taylor. While models, such as Lesson Studies, may encourage that culture, teachers don&apos;t need to wait for a national framework to inform their practice; many already look abroad for support and collaboration with colleagues from across the world. The geography, on the whole, is irrelevant. From online courses to school partnerships and conferences, teachers are discovering that CPD does not have to be specific to your country any more. It&apos;s an idea that appeals to Diana Linford, who teaches at two primary schools and is the eTwinning ambassador for Yorkshire and Humberside. The programme allows pupils to learn alongside children across Europe, exchanging Skype calls and blogs. But it also means that teachers can collaborate with colleagues in other countries. For Linford, it has even involved shadowing teachers at a school in France to get an insight into their pedagogy. &quot;It&apos;s hard to put your finger on it, but you meet really motivated teaches from around Europe and you share good practice,&quot; she says. &quot;I&apos;ve learnt a lot from those people and it provides you with a network who you can continue to work with. They&apos;re people you can turn to and say: &apos;how do you do that?&apos;&quot; The down side is that international collaboration like this is not formally recognised by schools in the UK. &quot;My school always say it&apos;s great that I&apos;ve been on the courses, but it doesn&apos;t count towards my training,&quot; Linford explains. &quot;The fact that I&apos;ve been on a weekend conference in Lisbon is irrelevant, whereas in other countries it is recognised as part of your CPD.&quot; Perhaps recognition of CPD, rather than the specific models used, is the most important thing for schools. It&apos;s something that many European schools don&apos;t experience at all. In Romania, for instance, maths teacher Alina Beleaga says schools &quot;don&apos;t do anything to support teachers&apos; professional development.&quot; &quot;Some teachers work together, but those are just the ones really dedicated to the work. There are still a lot of teachers who are not involved in anything and feedback from children is never included.&quot; Whatever methods of CPD British schools adopt, the real lesson from other countries is to recognise its importance.

The results of the OECD survey, which put England close to the bottom in literacy and numeracy among 16-24 year olds among developed nations, comes despite \u2013 or perhaps in part owing to \u2013 decades of permanent revolution aimed at improving the education system. But the problem, say those who study the subject, may not just lie in England&apos;s schools but in the lack of encouragement and opportunity for people who are falling behind to study once they have left. The OECD found not just low levels of achievement in numeracy and literacy tests among the population as a whole, but strikingly poor results among the 16 to 24-year-old age group. According to the survey, England&apos;s young adults performed on a par with their 55-65 year-old counterparts in literacy and numeracy \u2013 in contrast to the other countries in the survey, who saw young adults outperform their older brethren in one or both categories. Professor Chris Husbands, director of the Institute of Education, said that while Britain had high flyers as skilled and educated as its international peers, it was the country&apos;s failure to improve those on the bottom rungs of educational achievement that saw it lag behind the likes of Finland and Japan. &quot;It&apos;s the classic problem that this country has not solved over 150 years: how do you educate the masses?&quot; Husbands said. &quot;We have never \u2013 culturally, politically \u2013 thought about what we want our education system to be like for all our children. That, for me, is the big historic failure. We have to get it right and time is running out.&quot; Those countries that appeared well above England and Northern Ireland on the international league tables \u2013 such as Finland and Singapore \u2013 have developed more successful structures for post-16 education that go beyond Britain&apos;s patchwork of vocational qualifications for those who don&apos;t stay on to do A-levels and then potentially go to university. A recent report by Ofsted on access and achievement in English schools found that 16-year-olds who failed to achieve proficiency in literacy and numeracy had only a one-in-seven chance of doing so by the age of 18. &quot;It&apos;s not that our education system is failing right across the board, it&apos;s that we are not very good at the compensatory provision between 16 and 19,&quot; Husbands said. With a third of employers in the UK not offering any training to their staff, the result is that young adults in employment are unable to catch up or maintain their skills through workplace training. &quot;These results show that we have neglected enabling young people to continue with a core of general education, which is what they would get in many other European countries,&quot; said Lorna Unwin, professor of vocational education at the University of London. Rules introduced by Labour but which came into effect in September mean that young people must either stay on at school or be in training or apprenticeships until the age of 18. Alison Wolf, the King&apos;s College London professor who recently wrote a review of vocational education for the Department of Education, said: &quot;The obvious point to make is that, until this year, we have been pretty much unique in the world in allowing our young people to give up maths and English at age 16, at a time when every other developed country has been increasing its general education requirements for 16-19 year olds. &quot;The results are what you might expect given this \u2013 and I&apos;m therefore very pleased indeed that the government adopted my recommendation that everyone without maths or English GCSE grades at A*-C should continue with those subjects. I hope it will be the first stage of a more general emphasis on maintaining and improving those general and critical skills.&quot; In the Netherlands, which showed outstanding results for numeracy, pupils are divided as young as 12 into academic and vocational education, with 60% of students going into vocational schools that continue to provide a general education. But Unwin pointed out that the proportion of low-skilled jobs in the UK was partly responsible for the poor level of vocational education. &quot;We shouldn&apos;t separate education from what&apos;s happening in the labour market,&quot; Unwin said. &quot;If people don&apos;t get the opportunity to practise their skills, we know from research that skills deteriorate. That goes for numeracy, literacy as well as any other types of skills.&quot; For all the talk of reform in the education system, it may be that existing levels of disadvantage mean that there are limits to what schools alone can achieve in improving reading, writing and counting. A report published on Tuesday by Save The Children found that children from low-income families are falling behind at school by the age of seven, with most unlikely to go on and achieve good GCSE grades in maths and English. That suggests a social problem with deeper roots, as revealed by the latest results from the government&apos;s phonics check \u2013 gauging reading skills among five and six-year-olds at state primary schools \u2013 which showed that 180,000 children in England failed to meet the DfE&apos;s standard. &quot;It&apos;s not a problem of the last five years. It&apos;s not a problem of the last 15 years. It&apos;s not a problem of the coalition government. It&apos;s not a problem of New Labour. It&apos;s not a problem of the Thatcher government. It&apos;s a problem of consistent and persistent failure over 30 years to address skill development at the lower end of the attainment range,&quot; said Husbands. If there was a positive note it was that the last time the OECD conducted similar research \u2013 its 1996 international adult literacy survey \u2013 the results for England and Northern Ireland were worse. This time, Northern Ireland in particular improved significantly. The survey showed an even weaker performance from the US, which ranked bottom for numeracy for 16 to 24-year-olds, and in the lower half of the tables overall, below England and Northern Ireland. Where the US once boasted 42% of the world&apos;s highest-skilled adults, according to the OECD, it now has just 28%. But having skills is a different matter from making them economically viable. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s special advisor on education, pointed out: &quot;While the US and England have a limited skills base, they are extracting good value from it. The reverse is true for Japan, where rigid labour-market arrangements prevent many high-skilled individuals, most notably women, from reaping the rewards that should accrue to them.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/09/royal-mail-shares-trading", "sentences": ["Though Royal Mail is being privatised, expect many of its shares to end up in the hands of funds run by the Singapore and Norwegian governments, as well as the funds of Middle East oil states."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-09T13:53:22Z", "title": "Royal Mail shares \u2013 what happens next", "tags": ["Shares", "Investments", "Money", "Royal Mail", "Business", "UK news", "Privatisation", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Investing", "Financial sector"], "article": "The door closed on applications for Royal Mail shares at midnight on Tuesday. Early indications are that the offer may have been heavily over-subscribed, with big City and foreign institutions applying for more shares than are available, and speculators flocking to the issue in the hope of swift gains. Around 700,000 small investors have tried to apply for shares in the \u00a33bn issue, with privatisation fever gripping Britain (well, the better-off bits, perhaps) in a way not seen since the 1990s. So what happens now? When do I hear about my shares? The first news will come on Friday 11 October at 7am, when the government will announce how many shares were applied for, how it is going to distribute them, and the price it is selling them at. In the City, dealing in shares will begin at 8am. Because the issue has been over-subscribed, applicants will receive fewer shares than they wanted. The way you will find out about your allocation will depend on how you applied: Via a share dealer Each dealer will have its own way of contacting customers, but most of the big dealers will publish details on their websites shortly after 7am on Friday. The dealer then issues a contract note detailing the (legally binding) number of shares you have bought. Most investors can expect to receive an email on Friday morning giving them the news, and how they can then deal in the shares on that day if they wish to. Via gov.uk/royalmailshares You won&apos;t be able to deal on Friday if you bought through the official government website. Indeed, you won&apos;t hear about your allocation until Tuesday 15 October, and that is only if you elected to receive an email. You cannot deal in the shares until you have received your formal &quot;share account statement&quot;. Via the Post Office Those who bought this way, and who may not have an internet connection, will be informed by post. The government&apos;s intention is that they will hear by Monday 21 October. Again, shares cannot be traded by the investor until they have been notified of their allocation. How will scaling back work? The government is keeping tight-lipped on this. By now it will know how much the big institutions have asked for, and what price they are bidding, and how many small investors have applied. In the past it has favoured the latter by operating a sliding scale of allocations, where those who apply for the least (in this case the \u00a3750 minimum) will receive all or nearly all of what they asked for, while those who were seeking the most received just a small proportion. When the privatisation was launched, the government indicated that 70% of the shares would go to institutions and 30% to retail investors, but that is not legally binding, and it is now under intense pressure to change the balance to favour smaller buyers. What will the price of shares be? The price range in the prospectus was 260p-330p, and given the level of subscriptions most experts reckon that on Friday it will be very much at the top end of that range. Government officials stress, however, that it won&apos;t be set above the 330p level. When does dealing begin? Something called &quot;conditional&quot; trading begins on Friday at 8am, while the formal listing on the London Stock Exchange and start of official trading begins at 8am on Tuesday. Conditional trading is when the big institutions such as pension funds and hedge funds find out about their allocations and can trade among themselves. What is likely to happen to the share price on Friday? That is anyone&apos;s guess. The highest first-day trading premium was for the first offer of BT shares in 1984, which jumped by 35%. When the electricity and water companies were privatised in the early 1990s, first day rises were around 20%-23%. IG Index, a spread-betting company, expects Royal Mail&apos;s closing price on Friday, the first day of conditional trading, to be between 390p and 410p. That suggests that investors who sell out immediately could make an instant profit of as much as 24%, assuming it comes to the market at 330p. The institutions that have not received the allocations they want are expected to be in the market snapping up shares from small investors. Royal Mail may even go into the FTSE 100, triggering huge buying demand from tracker funds which aim to replicate the constituent shares of the index. But nothing on the stock market is guaranteed. Shares in Railtrack, launched at 380p and initally soared, but eventually it went into administration and investors received 250p back. Has it been sold too cheaply? If in first-day trading the shares jump towards 400p, the government will face serious accusations that it has sold off a prized national asset for substantially less than its worth. The winners will be the big investors who receive large allocations of shares, among whom will be foreign governments who control vast sovereign wealth funds that tend to snap up these sorts of share offers. Though Royal Mail is being privatised, expect many of its shares to end up in the hands of funds run by the Singapore and Norwegian governments, as well as the funds of Middle East oil states. \u2022 Disclosure: the author of this article is an applicant for Royal Mail shares."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2013/oct/10/imf-predicts-riskier-times-australia", "sentences": ["In fact, if you look at a comparison of where the IMF expected advanced economies to be by 2014 when the GFC hit and where they are now, Australia has performed better than all but Singapore, Taiwan and Israel:      Countries like Korea and China have grown faster than Australia, but they were expected to do so."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-10T05:36:00Z", "title": "IMF predicts riskier and bleaker times ahead for Australia", "tags": ["Australian economy", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Financial crisis", "Unemployment", "Business", "Currencies"], "article": "The latest World Economic Outlook released by the IMF on Wednesday was a bit of a sobering document. Given that the IMF has been delivering pretty sober assessments for more than four years now, it&apos;s not that surprising. This time the outlook also involved a bit of looking back at how good things were expected to be before the GFC/great recession hit, and how bad they were predicted to be once it did. What is striking is that for many countries and parts of the world, 2013 finds them in a worse position than where they were expected to be in April 2009 when the IMF issued its first bleak outlook after the tumult of the GFC. So while there has been some joy in the UK because the IMF has revised its prediction for growth in 2013 from the meagre 0.7% expected in the April WEO up to 1.4%, it is worth remembering that back in April 2009 the IMF expected the UK to be growing about 2.8% by now. For the next three years it kept revising down that prediction. Only in the past year has the IMF been too pessimistic:      For Australia, the reverse is true. If we look at the predictions for GDP growth from 2007 onwards, the IMF in 2008, before the GFC hit, was rather buoyant about Australia&apos;s future. It expected by the end of 2013 Australia&apos;s economy would have grown 20% above where it was in 2007. When the GFC hit, the IMF got real gloomy and revised this down to a mere 9.2%. And yet on Wednesday the IMF reported Australia&apos;s economy growing by 16% since 2007.      In fact, if you look at a comparison of where the IMF expected advanced economies to be by 2014 when the GFC hit and where they are now, Australia has performed better than all but Singapore, Taiwan and Israel:      Countries like Korea and China have grown faster than Australia, but they were expected to do so. Back in April 2009 the IMF expected Australia, the US and Canada to get through the GFC with much the same growth, but only Australia performed above expectations. So Australia has gone through the GFC much better than expected, but interestingly back in 2010 the IMF thought we would be in better shape than we are now. Moreover, the latest outlook has revised down the estimate for Australia&apos;s GDP growth in 2014 from its April estimate of 3.3% to 2.8%. Similarly, it has changed its expectations of our unemployment. In April it thought unemployment in 2014 would reach 5.2%, now it says 6.0% is the more likely outcome. Treasurer Joe Hockey noted this increase, saying, &quot;Worryingly, the IMF forecasts Australia&apos;s unemployment rate to rise from 5.6 per cent in 2013 to 6.0 per cent in 2014.&quot; As Michael Pascoe observed, however, the IMF&apos;s forecast on unemployment is actually rather more optimistic than that of the Treasury, which in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook predicted unemployment to reach 6.25% by June 2014.  So there are ups and downs to the outlook, but there certainly are risks looking ahead. Rather as Australia&apos;s economy has experienced transition, so, too, has the world economy. The IMF notes that while most advanced economies are gradually strengthening, &quot;at the same time growth in emerging market economies has slowed&quot;. For Australia this slowing is particularly important. The report estimates that the slowdown of Chinese growth from an average of 10% during the previous decade to an average of 7.5% over the coming decade will reduce Australia&apos;s revenue in exports by about 3% of GDP over that time. This makes us second only to China&apos;s neighbour, Mongolia, in exposure to a Chinese slowdown. And slow down China has. In the past three years the IMF has reduced its expectations for China&apos;s growth in 2014 from 9.5% to 8.5% to 7.3%. It now only predicts annual growth each year till 2018 to be 7.0%. How low is that? Well it hasn&apos;t been that low since 1990.      So the struggles lie ahead for Australia, and for those hoping relief might come from a lower dollar and a boost to our manufacturing sector, the news is not great either. The IMF suggests the &quot;US recovery is set to accelerate&quot; \u2013 though this assumes &quot;the shutdown is short, discretionary public spending is approved and executed as assumed in the forecast and the debt ceiling is raised promptly&quot;.  Even with these somewhat risky assumptions it predicts the US Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates until 2016. And until that happens it is unlikely our dollar will fall to anywhere near the long-term average of 80 US cents."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/oct/10/lessons-educators-countries-ahead-cpd", "sentences": ["&quot;It takes a number of different levers to change what&apos;s happening in a large complicated system, but professional development is going to be an important one.&quot; With that in mind, here&apos;s a guide to some of the world&apos;s education success stories: Maths: Singapore Along with other east Asian countries, Singapore has been hailed for its innovative maths education, producing world-class results.", "In Singapore, learning times tables parrot fashion is frowned upon.", "That hasn&apos;t stopped Singapore&apos;s success catching the attention of schools in the USA, where some have adopted the system and it has enjoyed rave reviews.", "A recent study, which highlighted Singapore&apos;s success, also claimed: &quot;An early start is crucial in shaping children&apos;s numeracy skills.&quot; Social and emotional learning: Sweden and USA Headteacher Zoe Dunn recently explored classrooms in the US and Sweden to find out how they approached social and emotional learning."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-10T14:30:00Z", "title": "Lessons for educators: which countries are miles ahead in professional development?", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Professional development", "Education", "Schools", "Teaching", "Mathematics", "Languages"], "article": "Teaching is an international issue and, increasingly, teachers are looking abroad for ideas about professional development. Whether you&apos;re trying to improve a subject lesson or enhance your own continuous professional development (CPD), there&apos;s always somewhere to go for ideas and inspiration. &quot;It&apos;s important to keep an eye on what&apos;s happening abroad, but there&apos;s no magic formula,&quot; says David Weston, chief executive of the Teacher Development Trust. &quot;It takes a number of different levers to change what&apos;s happening in a large complicated system, but professional development is going to be an important one.&quot; With that in mind, here&apos;s a guide to some of the world&apos;s education success stories: Maths: Singapore Along with other east Asian countries, Singapore has been hailed for its innovative maths education, producing world-class results. The UK, meanwhile, lags miserably behind. In Singapore, learning times tables parrot fashion is frowned upon. Children are encouraged to develop core maths skills in creative, noisy classrooms, using props and diagrams to explain abstract concepts. The system, which was developed in the 1980s, couldn&apos;t be more different from traditional approach in the UK because short-term targets are scrapped in favour of an in-depth, slow-burning understanding of mathematic principles. And, with pupils encouraged to learn at their own pace, it&apos;s a tricky tactic to attempt. That hasn&apos;t stopped Singapore&apos;s success catching the attention of schools in the USA, where some have adopted the system and it has enjoyed rave reviews. In recent years, some UK schools have also tried it out, such as Northwood Preparatory School in Hertfordshire. As always though, teachers&apos; pedagogy is only part of the equation. A recent study, which highlighted Singapore&apos;s success, also claimed: &quot;An early start is crucial in shaping children&apos;s numeracy skills.&quot; Social and emotional learning: Sweden and USA Headteacher Zoe Dunn recently explored classrooms in the US and Sweden to find out how they approached social and emotional learning. &quot;The classrooms are full of mood meters and feelings charts as well as quiet areas that pupils can go to think, problem solve, reflect and resolve disputes using clearly-defined steps,&quot; she writes about the US. &quot;At the heart of the American school day is the importance of patriotism, national pride and the American flag.&quot; Although the approach stems from classroom culture, schools also use more formal frameworks to develop emotional learning, such as the Resolving Conflict Creatively Program (RCCP). At the heart of the scheme is strong CPD, with a focus on teacher training and classroom management. It&apos;s a far cry from the freedom and autonomy found in Swedish schools. There, social and emotional learning is tied up with an emphasis on self-motivation. Pupils are encouraged to think independently, and have individualised guidance from teachers. The realities of large classes in the UK, however, mean that it might not always be practical for teachers to directly copy this method. Languages: Malta and Sweden The route to success in language teaching lies in a complex multitude of factors, from the curriculum to the culture and geography of a country. But, despite the caveats, teachers can still take ideas and inspiration from abroad. In 2011, the European Survey on Language Competences highlighted Malta and Sweden as leaders in pupils&apos; foreign language achievements. The reason is simple: they speak the languages at home. In both countries, English is spoken by nearly 90% of the population and the media is in both native and foreign languages. But it&apos;s not all about home-schooling: effective teaching supports the multilingual culture. In Malta, for instance, language teachers report high levels of funding and, for pupils, it&apos;s given prominence in the curriculum. Students&apos; attitudes may also make a difference to learning approaches: in Malta and Sweden, students say they find learning English easy \u2013 an attitude not found in other European countries. It is almost impossible to replicate the same level of language immersion that students in Sweden and Malta experience, but the techniques have nevertheless begun to emerge in the UK. In Bohunt School in Hampshire, each new year group is assigned a language, be it French, Spanish or Chinese. Then, lessons in ICT, art, PE, social studies and after-school activities are taught in that language. Teacher&apos;s professional development: Japan Japan has become a notable case study for CPD, with a system that was a well-kept secret for decades. The Lesson Study scheme originated in the nineteenth century, and provides a structured programme for peer-to-peer development. Collaborating with a group of teachers, a lesson is planned, observed and analysed. Together, the teachers learn from each other, and share insights into their pedagogy. The result is a more open and public forum for education, where there may be as many teachers as children in a classroom. Critics say it creates an unnatural environment in schools, but the Japanese system has already been adopted by teachers across Asia and is quickly finding its feet in Europe. Furthermore, the Lesson Study model has itself become internationally collaborative, as the system evolves in unique ways in each new country. For UK teachers, while some schools have already strictly implemented the programme, Japan&apos;s most important lesson is the importance of collaboration in professional development.

The cuts in social spending are regrettable, we are told, but they have to be made because the government cannot have more outgoings than its income, as no sensible household should. Didn&apos;t Adam Smith, the grandfather of economics, tell us that what &quot;is prudence in the conduct of every private family can scarcely be folly in that of a great kingdom&quot;? The argument for book-balancing has been used even to justify the privatisation of Royal Mail, not least because the usual argument about inefficiency of public enterprises does not apply to it. The sale will increase government revenue and thus reduce budget deficits, it is said. In the same vein, the government has patted itself on the back for selling (and planning to sell) the shares of the bailed-out banks at a profit, further reducing deficits. Don&apos;t be fooled by all the boring language of bookkeeping, however. Behind it lies an ambitious project to restructure British society fundamentally by expanding the domains of our life that are subject to market forces. In the last few years, regulation has been strengthened for the financial sector, although not as much as you would have thought, given the mess that it created. But in almost all other areas of life, the trend has been an unleashing of market forces. And the results have been rather stark \u2013 and will become more so, if the project is allowed to continue. Thanks to cuts in social spending, the disabled and the elderly have had to buy more expensive supports from the market \u2013 or, more typically, put up with greater discomfort and indignity. With cuts in unemployment benefit, an increasing number of workers have been forced to accept zero-hour contracts and other employment conditions that are more fitting for developing countries, if not exactly for the Victorian era. Privatisation and contracting-out of government services have meant that more and more services that used to be provided on the basis of citizenship are now distributed according to how much people can pay. As we have already seen with energy, water and railways, privatisation of &quot;natural monopolies&quot; means higher prices and/or lower quality services, unless regulation severely constrains market forces, as it does in countries such as Japan. In the most extreme cases, privatisation of natural monopolies can mean more deaths \u2013 ranging from casualties of rail accidents caused by under-investment in safety to untimely deaths of pensioners weakened by inadequate heating. When Royal Mail joins this list, we can be assured that deliveries to remote areas will become less frequent and/or more expensive, while postal workers will have greater workload and less time for human contact. The point is that markets are run on the principle of &quot;one pound, one vote&quot;, which means that those who have enough money can fulfil even the most frivolous of their desires, while those who don&apos;t may starve to death. And it is because we don&apos;t want such outcomes that humanity has learned to control market forces through public regulation \u2013 ideally decided on the &quot;one person, one vote&quot; principle of democracy. As a result, over time, many things have been taken out \u2013 at least partially \u2013 of the market: human beings (slaves), child labour, public offices, basic education, healthcare and so on. Even for the marketed things, how you can make money out of them has come under increasing restrictions. For example, in the old days drugs did not require an approval before sales, and companies did not have to reveal anything about themselves when selling shares. Of course, in the past few decades, the trend towards such &quot;de-marketisation&quot; has been reversed in many countries, especially in the UK. However, that was not because the boundaries of the market as they existed in the 1960s and 70s had been drawn in violation of some natural laws, as the proponents of deregulation and privatisation like to suggest. It was mainly due to the shift in political balance of power towards the moneyed classes, which has unfortunately been accelerating in recent years. The argument that there are no natural boundaries of the market is best illustrated by Singapore. This successful country is often portrayed as the paragon of free market, but it is actually something quite different. All of its land is publicly owned, 85% of housing is supplied by the public housing corporation and more than 20% of national output is produced by public enterprises, in industries ranging from shipbuilding and semi-conductors to airlines and banking. Saying that there is no one correct way of drawing boundaries around the market is, of course, not to say that we can do without markets. Vibrant markets are essential for generating prosperity and improving human welfare, as the counter-examples of the Soviet bloc countries show. But that does not mean that more market forces are always better, in the same way in which salt is essential for our survival but too much of it is harmful. Markets are in the end man-made devices for utilitarian purposes, not a force of nature that we should not try to resist. If they end up serving the interests of only a tiny minority, as is increasingly the case, we have the right \u2013 and indeed the duty \u2013 to regulate them in the interest of greater social good."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/10/felipe-massa-ferrari-formula-one", "sentences": ["But he remains outspoken in his condemnation of the cheating at Singapore that season which he believes really cost him the title.", "&quot;Maybe the race I feel that we lost the championship was Singapore.", "What happened in Singapore is unacceptable, it cannot happen, I lost the championship there.&quot; Massa had started from pole in Singapore and had built up a three-second lead over Hamilton when Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s Renault crashed and brought out the safety car, at which point Massa pitted."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-10T22:16:00Z", "title": "Felipe Massa: 'Singapore was like a match where they pay the referee'", "tags": ["Felipe Massa", "Ferrari", "Formula One 2013", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Felipe Massa has announced that he would rather not drive next season than be forced to play second fiddle to another driver, despite having become liked and respected in the paddock for his dedication to the team game during his career. His comments are a stark reminder of the potential problems Ferrari may face in 2014, having paired Fernando Alonso with Kimi Raikkonen, neither of whom will be likely to slip into the role Massa has performed so dutifully since 2006. Speaking in the buildup to this weekend&apos;s Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka when asked if, in his next drive, he would wish to be the No1 driver in a new team, Massa was unequivocal. &quot;I want that, yes,&quot; he said. &quot;I will do everything I can to achieve that.&quot; He added that he would not accept a drive where he was not the team leader. The determination is understandable. During his time at Ferrari he has been paired with some formidable drivers. His debut was alongside Michael Schumacher and three years with Raikkonen followed, including the incident where he was hit by a spring that had come loose from the Brawn of Rubens Barrichello in 2009, before Alonso joined in 2010. With the exception of 2008, when he almost took the title, he has been largely in their shadows. Indeed his drives alongside Alonso were marked by some very public exhibitions of his position as the No2 driver, particularly when being told to move over for the Spaniard at Hockenheim in 2010 to the heart-wrenching refrains of engineer Rob Smedley&apos;s apologies and taking a team-imposed five-place grid drop at the US Grand Prix last year. Speaking about the latter incident at the time, the team principal, Stefano Domenicali, might well have summed up much of Massa&apos;s tenure with Ferrari and the debt they owed him. &quot;When you work for the Ferrari team you know the team was the centre of the decision,&quot; he said. &quot;I have to thank Felipe for that.&quot; Although he is unsigned, the future he has envisaged places himself, finally, at the very centre of any squad, one that he would hope to build around himself. &quot;A team that can build a stronger car, a stronger working environment,&quot; he said. &quot;A team that has the possibility to create something, that would be interesting.&quot; Central to which would be to have a team-mate ready to make moves on his behalf at last. &quot;At the right time, yes,&quot; he said, when asked if he would expect a future colleague to fulfil the role he has played so diligently. &quot;Not at the first race and we are fighting, no. That&apos;s not fair.&quot; The difficulty facing the 32-year-old is that finding this team, given his own strictures may be tricky. There are realistically only two seats he would take, one alongside Romain Grosjean at Lotus or one of the two potential seats at Sauber currently occupied by Nico H\u00fclkenberg and Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez. Massa would no doubt prefer Lotus but they seem to favour H\u00fclkenberg, who is in fine form and wants Lotus to make up their minds by the end of the month. Although the Brazilian believes he will have a decision by then too, there remains a chance he will be without a drive at all next year. That would probably leave those 38.9sec in 2008 when he thought he was world champion \u2013 before Lewis Hamilton passed Timo Glock at the final race in Brazil to take the title by a single point \u2013 as the closest he has come to being No1. As at the time, when he gave touching and gracious congratulations to Hamilton, the race holds little rancour for Massa. But he remains outspoken in his condemnation of the cheating at Singapore that season which he believes really cost him the title. &quot;I lost the championship in the other races,&quot; he said. &quot;Maybe the race I feel that we lost the championship was Singapore. What happened in Singapore is unacceptable, it cannot happen, I lost the championship there.&quot; Massa had started from pole in Singapore and had built up a three-second lead over Hamilton when Nelson Piquet Jr&apos;s Renault crashed and brought out the safety car, at which point Massa pitted. His crew prematurely released him from the box with the fuel hose still attached and farce ensued as they chased him down the pit lane trying to remove it. Piquet subsequently revealed he had been ordered to crash by his team to improve the chances of his team-mate Alonso, who won the race. Massa rejoined at the back and was then given a drive-through for unsafe release and finished 13th \u2013 out of the points \u2013 while Hamilton finished third with six. &quot;What happened there is like in football when you have a match where they pay the referee,&quot; said Massa. &quot;We see matches in football where they see they pay the referee and the team that loses goes to court. In Formula One nothing happens.&quot; After the incident the Renault team principal, Flavio Briatore, was banned for life, a decision that was subsequently overturned, and the engineer Pat Symonds banned for five years, also overturned; although he agreed to remain outside the sport until 2013, he is now chief technical officer for Williams. Renault received a two-year suspended disqualification. This is cold comfort for a man who missed the title by the slenderest of margins but while it clearly still rankles, it is the future that concerns him as he goes into his final five races for Ferrari. &quot;I will never cry for what has happened,&quot; he said. &quot;I feel sorry but we need to think forward. &quot;I am sure I can give a lot to another team. I am also happy about this situation, I am happy to change. I am happy to start from zero, to create, to restart.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/oct/11/50-best-bars-in-the-world", "sentences": ["28 Hong Kong Street (Singapore)"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-11T10:35:36Z", "title": "Talking point: are these the best bars in the world?", "tags": ["Travel", "Bars and clubs", "London holidays"], "article": "The World&apos;s 50 Best Bars awards ceremony took place in London on Thursday night and four out of the top 10 are in London.

This figure is rising at a rate of 20% per year and the report&apos;s authors forecast the amount of computer waste across the country could increase by nearly 500% by 2020. With a population of 8 million people, Bangalore has emerged as a global telecommuncations and technology hub shouldering 40% of India&apos;s IT industry. Since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, major international firms such as Infosys, Intel and Microsoft have opened bases there along with nearly 3,000 software firms, 35 hardware manufacturers and hundreds of other small scale businesses \u2013 turning this once lush farmland into India&apos;s Silicon Valley. More than 500 Bangalore-based companies generate an annual revenue of over $17bn (\u00a310.5bn) \u2013 a healthy portion of India&apos;s $85bn total tech-based export that started life as outsourcing and backoffice centres. Have you ever phoned your mobile phone company and been put through someone in India? They may well have been in Bangalore. The Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) set up a formal recycling system for e-waste to deal with Bangalore&apos;s growing tech dump. But awareness of the e-waste management and handling rules is poor. Up to 90% of this waste is still handled through the informal sector \u2013 by firms who employ low-paid workers to process and incinerate e-waste. The people who do this are unaware of safety measures needed for the work. They release lead, mercury and other toxins into the air and use acids to extract precious metals from hardware. What can&apos;t be got out is unceremoniously dumped \u2013 letting pollutants seep into groundwater. Hal Watts, a designer who trained at the Royal College of Art&apos;s sustainability wing, SustainRCA, has devised a bicycle-powered machine that separates valuable copper from electronics. Copper is used in all circuit boards and within most wires. Its ubiquity is what makes it a valuable commodity for people who scavenge through piles of e-waste and sell the copper on. &quot;All recycling technologies have been designed with large western recycling plants in mind,&quot; says Watts. &quot;There is almost no equipment that is affordable enough for the informal recycling sector because no single recycler deals with enough waste to afford these large machines. &quot;The informal recycler breaks up waste, sells the copper to one guy, the plastic to another, the circuit boards to another etc. These guys amass their material and sell it to an exporter who then flogs it to a recycling plant often located in a developed country.&quot; Countries such as Singapore, Belgium and Japan have smelting units that extract precious metals the human eye can&apos;t see. Further up the recycling chain are startups like Karma Recycling. Based in New Delhi with a nationwide expansion plan to open a hub in Bangalore, Karma targets end users and consumers. Most Indians have access to basic technologies like mobile telephones, televisions and radios. A rapidly expanding middle class also has access to personal computers and other comforts. If you can&apos;t sell your old gadget on to someone else, Karma provides a system where you can get an online quote for it. They buy it from you, refurbish or dismantle it and then sell those components on. They also have logistics solutions to handle larger hauls of rejected or broken electronics. &quot;Electronic waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world,&quot; says Akshat Ghiya, Karma Recycling&apos;s co-founder. &quot;If it&apos;s not recycled scientifically, it leads to a waste of diminishing natural resources, causes irreparable damage to the environment and to the health of the people working in the industry. &quot;Companies design new and improved gadgets every day, flooding the markets month after month, year after year. What happens with these devices when we&apos;re done with them? It is time for us as a society to realise that what has gone around (and has been used), must come around (and be reused).&quot; There is legislation that governs the disposal of used and defunct electronics, requring e-waste to be collected, transported and safely disposed. Sale of some electronic scrap to un-authorised or unlicensed dealers and vendors, large or small-scale, is illegal. But that doesn&apos;t stop the murkier side of the industry from operating. The informal recycling industry often employs children to dismantle electronic waste. Assocham&apos;s report strongly advocates legislation to prevent a child&apos;s entry into this labour market. The report also reveals that less than 5% of India&apos;s e-waste is recycled. Consumerism works much the same around the world \u2013 something new and shiny comes out and those that can afford it try to get it. &quot;Objects are not currently designed to be recycled,&quot; says Watts. &quot;A change in design practices won&apos;t occur without stricter legislation or until materials become so expensive that there is real interest from companies to design with recycling in mind.&quot; When it comes to the reduction of e-waste, the onus is on both the consumer and the producer. In Bangalore, and elsewhere, individuals and companies have to see the fiscal benefits in upgrading without disposing what they had before.

The German has been booed at various grands prix since the incident at the Malaysian race when, having been told to hold station behind his team-mate Mark Webber, he mounted an attack and overtook him for the win. That initial outburst and one that followed in Canada have been attributed to unsportsmanlike behaviour. However, subsequent heckling, at both Monza and Singapore, has also been seen as a reaction to Vettel&apos;s dominance of the sport. When Vettel addressed the issue after Singapore, he said: &quot;Some people like what we do, some people don&apos;t. If they boo, it&apos;s a compliment \u2013 that&apos;s the way I take it, they are jealous because I win. As long as they keep booing we&apos;re doing a very good job, that&apos;s the way I see it.&quot; But Horner, speaking after Vettel topped the timing sheets in the second practice at Suzuka, painted a different picture. &quot;He&apos;s a human being, he&apos;s 26 years of age, he&apos;s travelling around the world on his own. He doesn&apos;t have a big entourage of managers and press advisers and gurus, it&apos;s him and his trainer and he&apos;s a young guy. &quot;When you do get a negative reaction when you have driven your heart out, no matter what he says, of course you feel it. I think it has been hugely unfair, because I don&apos;t think it has been justified.&quot; Vettel was not booed in Korea and it will certainly not happen here in Japan, where the driver and team are very popular and the fans are nothing but hugely enthusiastic toward every driver on the grid, thronging the fan zone here in Suzuka dressed up in all colours of allegiance, as noted by the German. &quot;They are very passionate about us coming here and I think all the drivers do get a lot of respect when we come here but equally a lot of support,&quot; he said on Thursday. Even were that not the case, Horner believes one area the poor receptions have not affected is his driver&apos;s focus and determination, however. While taking the title on Sunday may still be unlikely, with Vettel requiring a win and for his main rival, Fernando Alonso, to finish lower than eighth place, negative reactions will not play a part in him continuing to do what has been an absolutely exemplary day job on the track. &quot;He&apos;s just like any human being, of course you will be disappointed by that [reaction] but he is able to compartmentalise it. Not allow it to distract him. &quot;One of his strengths is that he stays within his own bubble and just takes each race at a time.&quot; Leaving aside simply disgruntled Ferrari fans, the heckling is part and parcel of both team and driver doing their jobs, believes Horner. In terms of the determination to win exhibited by Vettel, he said: &quot;A driver&apos;s interest at the end of the day is in themselves, they have to have a large element of selfishness, of ruthlessness. &quot;All the top sportsmen and women in all the major sports have that quality. Whether it is Roger Federer, whether it&apos;s Valentino Rossi, they all have that desire, burning ambition within them, that propels them to achieve the things that they are doing and Sebastian is absolutely no different to that.&quot; Of the dominance Vettel is enjoying, he rightly argues that it is up to the other teams to bring the fight to him. &quot;Can you understand fans&apos; frustrations?&quot; he considered. &quot;Yes, of course you can. A championship like last year where it goes down to the wire, where he is hunting Alonso down from being 42 points behind after the summer break \u2013 fantastic. Great for Bernie, great for Formula One and great for the show. &quot;But we enter a sporting championship at the beginning of the year and there is nothing in the regulations that says there&apos;s got to be a show and it has to go to the last race. We all sign up to those rules and do the best job that we can.&quot; Ultimately Vettel, Horner and Red Bull have done their talking on the track this season and it has echoed louder than any amount of noise coming from beneath the podium. History will, no doubt, record Vettel as making it four world championships in a row in 2013 and the rest, ultimately, will not even make the footnotes of what is F1&apos;s grand theatre. &quot;The booing is actually coming from a very small group and has been a sort of a pantomime effect,&quot; said Horner. &quot;I had a letter from a fan from Singapore that said he was writing an apology for booing, because he had done it because the chap next to him did. He felt dreadfully sorry about it and please could I pass on his apologies to Sebastian because he realised it was particularly unsporting. It&apos;s the X-Factor world that we live in now.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/11/naomi-campbell-digital-fashion-week", "sentences": ["Supermodel Naomi Campbell has announced she is to make her south east Asian runway debut at Digital Fashion Week (DFW) in Singapore \u2013 further strengthening ties between the fashion and technology industries."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-11T16:26:54Z", "title": "Naomi Campbell to lead Digital Fashion Week", "tags": ["Data visualisations", "Technology", "Fashion", "Big data", "Topshop", "Google", "YouTube", "Twitter"], "article": "Supermodel Naomi Campbell has announced she is to make her south east Asian runway debut at Digital Fashion Week (DFW) in Singapore \u2013 further strengthening ties between the fashion and technology industries.

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the jump in the share price \u2013 which made an immediate \u00a3284 paper profit for almost 700,000 Royal Mail investors \u2013 showed that the privatisation was a &quot;fire sale of a great British institution&quot;. Royal Mail stock, which the government sold at 330p, leapt to 455p\u2013 the biggest one-day rise in a privatisation since British Airways in 1987. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the steep rise showed the government had &quot;massively shortchanged&quot; taxpayers by significantly undervaluing the institution. Royal Mail&apos;s market value rose by \u00a31bn to \u00a34.3bn \u2013 confirming that it will join the FTSE 100 list of Britain&apos;s biggest companies. The government had valued Royal Mail at a maximum of \u00a33.3bn, and had attacked analysts&apos; valuation of \u00a34.5bn as &quot;way out&quot;. If the government had sold the shares at 450p, rather than 330p, it would have made an extra \u00a3600m for the taxpayer on top of the \u00a31.7bn it made from the 52% stake in Royal Mail. But sources close to the transaction said institutions would not have bid at that price. Billy Hayes, the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents more than 100,000 postal workers, said: &quot;Privatisation is about greed. I think Vince Cable is one of the cleverest men in the government, but he&apos;s made one of the stupidest mistakes in politics on privatising Royal Mail.&quot; Frances O&apos;Grady, general secretary of the TUC, tweeted: &quot;Privatising #RoyalMail has become little different from selling five pound notes for four quid.&quot; George Osborne said the privatisation had been a huge success. Speaking in Washington, the chancellor said: &quot;This is something both Labour and Conservative governments have tried to do and failed.&quot; Asked whether the shares had been sold too cheaply, the chancellor said: &quot;All privatisations are done at a discount. The sensible thing to do is not to make judgments on the price the day after but wait for things to settle down, and look at it in three to six months&apos; time.&quot; The chair of the Conservative thinktank, the Bow Group, added to the criticism. Ben Harris-Quinney said: &quot;It should now be clear to even the staunchest supporters of the government&apos;s flotation of Royal Mail that the company has been significantly undervalued. The government has clamped down on investors to try to mitigate profiteering, but it has delivered the worst of both worlds: a company placed at a fraction of its value, and a sale too restricted to realise that value.&quot; The National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, will investigate the pricing of the float, but Cable dismissed the huge share price rise \u2013 which was bigger than that experienced on the 1980s flotation of BT and British Gas \u2013 as &quot;froth and speculation&quot; and said &quot;what matters is where the price eventually settles&quot;. Ian Murray, the shadow minister for postal affairs, tweeted: &quot;Looking forward to Vince Cable&apos;s next Lib Dem Focus leaflet bearing the headline &apos;\u00a3600m loss to taxpayer just froth&apos;.&quot; The stockbrokers Peel Hunt said: &quot;This is not &apos;froth&apos;; it&apos;s real people buying, selling.&quot; More than 100m shares were traded within the first hour on the London Stock Exchange. The stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdowne buckled under the pressure from sellers for a period. Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, described the share price surge as a &quot;dazzling stock market debut&quot;. Private investors who bought their shares directly from the government will have to wait until at least Tuesday if they want to sell. About 690,000 people were granted 227 Royal Mail shares worth \u00a3749.10 (at the 330p float price) following overwhelming public demand for the shares. The public applied for more than seven times the number of shares available to them, which meant nearly everyone did not get as many shares as they had asked for. More than 36,000 people who applied for more than \u00a310,000 worth of shares were prevented from buying any at all. About 40 people applied for shares worth \u00a31m or more. Cable said the government told the &quot;very big wealthy investors \u2026 you wanted a big chuck, we can&apos;t give it to you&quot;. City investors, hedge funds and pension funds applied for more than 20 times the number of shares available to them. More than 800 City investors applied for shares, with 500 being left empty-handed. Sources said 90% of the shares reserved for the City went to &quot;responsible institutional investors&quot; such as pension funds. Investors include Threadneedle, Fidelity, Blackrock and Standard Life. However, the remaining 10% of shares have been granted to &quot;other investors&quot;, including hedge funds. Cable had said the government would prevent the shares from going to &quot;spivs and speculators&quot;. It is understood that about 20% of the shares available have gone to sovereign wealth funds \u2013 including those of Kuwait, Norway and Singapore \u2013 and other foreign funds. Royal Mail&apos;s 150,000 employees collected 10% of the shares free of charge, worth about \u00a32,200 each at the flotation price and now worth \u00a32,900. Employees were also allowed to buy a further \u00a310,000 worth, but are not allowed to sell for three years. Hayes said the share price rise would not make &quot;one scintilla of difference&quot; to employees&apos; widely expected intention to vote for strike action on Wednesday. Days of nationwide industrial action could start as soon as 23 October. The way we were There was said to have been &quot;pandemonium&quot; on the floor of the London Stock Exchange on the day shares in BT started trading in November 1983. The price rose 35% by the end of the first daybut it paid to hold on to them. Fidelity, the fund manager, believes BT shares have risen 280% since then. The most memorable sell-off \u2013 the &quot;Tell Sid&quot; advertising campaign to float British Gas three years later \u2013 attracted more than 1.5 million &quot;Sids&quot;. The shares were priced at 135p, before ending the first day 9% higher. Again it paid to sit tight. Fidelity calculates they have since risen 1,822%. In October 1987, the sale of the last tranche of shares in BP showed what can go wrong. It collided with the stock market crash and shares ended the day 20% below the 330p price at which they been sold to investors. Another sell-off that started promisingly, Railtrack, ended in misery for investors who bought the shares at 380p in May 1996. They got 250p in compensation after the rail operator went to administration in 2001."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/oct/13/sebastian-vettel-red-bull-f1", "sentences": ["After the races at Singapore and Korea, Vettel had achieved two &quot;Grand Chelem&quot; of securing pole and a race win that includes leading for every lap and scoring the fastest lap."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-12T23:39:41Z", "title": "Don't criticise Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull for doing their jobs | Giles Richards", "tags": ["Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2013", "Red Bull", "Mark Webber", "Fernando Alonso", "Motor sport", "Formula One", "Sport"], "article": "Whether Sebastian Vettel has clinched his fourth consecutive world championship here in Suzuka this morning or whether he must wait until India or Abu Dhabi, is somewhat moot. That the Red Bull driver will take the title is beyond doubt. Perhaps when he does and the petty booing he has received this season has faded, there will be more sober assessments. Analysis which, while acknowledging his undoubted skill, will also recognise that he is the sharp end of a huge team, for whom winning as a team means just as much as the silverware an individual driver hoists at the end of a race. There is no doubt that Vettel has the quickest car on the grid, but he has driven the Red Bull many times this season as if on rails, and his rivals have simply not been able to keep up. If he wins on Sunday and Fernando Alonso finishes below eighth, he will be world champion, and deservedly so. The German&apos;s dominance of F1 has been criticised for making it boring, but that is to criticise the driver for merely doing his job and it would be unfair. Sport has no script and, in winning this test of technology and skill, Vettel and Red Bull can hardly be blamed if there is no cliffhanger ending. Consider instead, the position he found himself in before qualifying. After the races at Singapore and Korea, Vettel had achieved two &quot;Grand Chelem&quot; of securing pole and a race win that includes leading for every lap and scoring the fastest lap. They took his total to four, but more importantly, only two other drivers have also scored two consecutive slams: Alberto Ascari in 1952 and Jim Clark in 1963 \u2013 and no one has scored three in a row. Sadly, a Kers problem in qualifying destroyed the dream and his Red Bull team-mate, Mark Webber, pipped him to pole position. Yet, that he was even challenging such a remarkable record is perhaps more of an indicator of the heights at which Vettel is now operating. He has not reached this position merely by being merely a fast pedaller either. &quot;So many times the drivers talk about what they want from the car, rather than trying to understand the car,&quot; Christian Horner, Red Bull&apos;s principal, said. &quot;Sebastian is able to adjust, to understand what the car needs to go quick.&quot; Equally, there is mental work going on beyond the natural skills of any F1 driver that belies his youthful 26 years. &quot;He&apos;s not afraid to look at himself,&quot; Horner says. &quot;To say: &apos;Where can I be better? What can I improve? What can I do to be a better driver?&apos; Even if we have won a race, he&apos;s looking at his own performance and he is hugely self-analytical and that&apos;s a key element and extremely refreshing to work with, because he&apos;s totally honest in his approach.&quot; Honest enough, too, to admit that it has been also a collective effort, the driver noting this week one of the reasons behind Red Bull&apos;s recent surge in form. &quot;On a Friday, you have one chance overnight to make a change,&quot; he said. &quot;And I think we got better as a team in that regard, to get closer to 100% on Saturday morning and then benefiting throughout the weekend.&quot; If he takes the drivers&apos; title here in Japan, it will be reason enough to celebrate for Red Bull, but of absolute equal importance to them is the constructors&apos; championship that they have won for the past three years, but which cannot be sealed here in Suzuka. And for those getting their hands dirty, it is being the best team on the block that really counts. Across the two garages, there is no Team Sebastian and Team Mark; there is only Red Bull. Ole Schack is Vettel&apos;s front-end mechanic, he has worked with him since he joined Red Bull and before that worked on David Coulthard&apos;s car. While the spotlight is always firmly focused on the men in the cockpit crossing the line, for Schack and his colleagues it is a different story. &quot;There are the two drivers, who are two individuals and then we are one big crew,&quot; he said. &quot;We don&apos;t get anything out of having one driver that&apos;s winning and the other one winning nothing at all. Because you won&apos;t win the constructors&apos; championship and that is, at the end of the day, the one that matters to us.&quot; It has been, he is right to point out, a team effort that has put them where they are today, on the verge of F1 glory. &quot;The most important thing is you keep developing. If you relax in this business you are behind,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s where we&apos;ve been very good as a team, to keep it up there. To defend the first title was very, very difficult and then do it two or three times. That&apos;s what we want to do every single year. There&apos;s a massive determination to keep doing well.&quot; Vettel, in turn, has delivered, and their achievements should be judged alongside one another and not merely through the lens of disappointment in the season not going to the wire."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/13/us-shutdown-threat-global-recovery-bankers", "sentences": ["Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore&apos;s finance minister and chairman of the IMF&apos;s key policymaking committee, said: &quot;It&apos;s a clear negative when you think about the key element of the recovery \u2013 private sector investment \u2013 that has to take place over the next one to two years."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-13T10:28:03Z", "title": "US shutdown threatens global recovery, bankers warn", "tags": ["Economic recovery", "US news", "US politics", "World news", "International Monetary Fund (IMF)", "Economics", "Business"], "article": "A still-fragile global recovery is being put at risk by Washington&apos;s squabbling politicians, finance ministers and governors of central banks have warned as they stepped up the pressure on the US to avoid a catastrophic debt default this week.

Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said: &quot;It is unthinkable that an agreement won&apos;t be found. If this situation were to last a long time this would be negative, very negative for the US economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.&quot; Financial markets rallied strongly at the end of last week as hopes were raised that a deal might be achieved by the weekend. But after talks broke down on Saturday, there were concerns that dealers would take fright at the show of brinkmanship taking place in Washington. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore&apos;s finance minister and chairman of the IMF&apos;s key policymaking committee, said: &quot;It&apos;s a clear negative when you think about the key element of the recovery \u2013 private sector investment \u2013 that has to take place over the next one to two years. &quot;Private investment relies on confidence and if we don&apos;t see a resolution of the US fiscal dispute it is hard to see how that is going to come back.&quot; Asked to grade politicians in Washington as if he were a school teacher, Tharman replied: &quot;Clearly room for improvement.&quot; Jim Yong Kim, president of the World Bank, said: &quot;We are now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline. The closer we get to the deadline, the greater the impact will be for the developing world. Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling, and growth slowing. &quot;If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that in turn will greatly hurt the developed economies as well. I urge US policymakers to avert this potential crisis.&quot; US administration sources said they had been encouraging the IMF and the G20 group of developed and developing countries to ratchet up the pressure on policymakers on Capital Hill to reach a budget deal. A communique released by the IMF said: &quot;The US needs to take urgent action to address short-term fiscal uncertainties.&quot; This echoed word-for-word a communique released by the G20. Jens Weidmann, the Bundesbank&apos;s president, ruled out the possibility of a default. &quot;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s a realistic scenario. I think one can trust that now, as in the past, the political [opponents] will manage to unite on a solution.&quot; The IMF believes that the impasse in Washington is holding back what would otherwise be a recovery in the global economy. It singled out Britain as one of the areas where progress had been made. &quot;The recovery in the US has gained ground, stimulus measures have induced a recovery in Japan, the euro area is emerging from recession, and in some other advanced economies including the UK growth is already picking up.&quot; The IMF told emerging market economies to prepare for likely volatility when the US starts to reduce the amount of stimulus it is providing for the world&apos;s biggest economy \u2013 the timetable for which is likely to be put back for several months by the government shutdown. It said that in certain circumstances, countries should seek to manage capital flows but the IMF&apos;s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said they should not &quot;be the first tool that should be relied on&quot;. The IMF meeting came five years after emergency action taken to bail out banks caught up in the financial panic that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, said the most important part of the reform programme prompted by the near-collapse of the financial system was to find a way of resolving the problems of the world&apos;s biggest banks without the need for taxpayer support. In his last speech before leaving the Bank at the end of the week, Tucker said: &quot;It is absolutely essential that the &apos;too big to fail&apos; problem is cracked. Nothing is more important to the success of the international reform agenda. Without it, global finance would remain fragile; and to protect against that, the international financial system would balkanise as individual countries sought to protect themselves. The stakes are high.&quot; Tucker said countries would have no excuse if they didn&apos;t solve the &quot;too big to fail&quot; problem through resolution regimes and reforms. &quot;The necessary technology is clear. The necessary restructuring of firms is clear. The necessary degrees and forms of cross-border co-operation are clear. It is a matter of: just do it,&quot; he said. The Bank of England was in principle prepared to step aside and allow the UK subsidiaries of big US financial groups to be reformed as part of a group-wide resolution led by the US authorities, Tucker said.

A win was required and a win was delivered. Only Fernando Alonso&apos;s dogged determination denied him. The German now only requires a top-five finish in India to finish the job with three races remaining and, while the early part of the year had promised the possibility of a race to the wire, he has dominated the second half with such authority and his car with such pace, that his opponents have been left reeling. The company he now keeps would recognise these traits. This will be his fourth consecutive world championship, only Juan Manuel Fangio, Alain Prost and Michael Schumacher have won four or more and only Fangio and Schumacher four on the bounce. Yet at the age of 26 he will also be the youngest to achieve the feat. Taking the title here in Suzuka was unlikely, as both he and the team had already admitted, but although Vettel achieved the victory he needed, making it four from five visits to Suzuka and five consecutive wins, Alonso&apos;s fourth place was enough to keep the championship alive for at least one more race. But, while there was no sense of disappointment at Red Bull who were understandably celebrating the one-two and remain equally focused on winning the constructors&apos; championship, there has been mixed emotions among fans. Many decried the &quot;Multi 21&quot; incident in Malaysia when Vettel disobeyed team orders and passed Mark Webber to take the win \u2013 booing ensued; many have grown tired of seeing &quot;the finger&quot;; but most importantly many have seen his domination as boring \u2013 hence more booing. No one wants to see the season finished so soon even if in so emphatic a fashion \u2013 five wins from the past five races, two Grand Chelems among them and with a two-second a lap advantage in Singapore. But some of the bile he and the team is now attracting is simply unfair. Much is of a similar variety that Ferrari have encountered and McLaren \u2013 that they are cheating or hiding an advantage, but much is personal towards Vettel. Memories, it seems, can often be short. He may have won in 2010 and 2012 but both were cracking seasons and both went to the final race. Had he failed to take the title at either, there would have been three different champions in the past four years \u2013 circumstances in which it is hard to imagine there being so much antipathy towards him. In which case, while it is understandable that many may lament the season as boring, it is less fair to direct that ire at the man whose task is to win the championship and because he will have done exactly that four times on the trot. Beyond a shadow of doubt any other driver would not consider for a moment that their role was to entertain or extend the season to its finale with a title at stake. Nor can one imagine the same expectation or the same opprobrium being directed at a British driver in similar circumstances. A driver rightly drawing plaudits in the wake of the race, however, was Lotus&apos;s Romain Grosjean and he deserved them. How much has changed in a year for the Frenchman, who was on the receiving end of a proper Aussie rollicking from Mark Webber at this race last year after he biffed the Red Bull out at turn two. One of several incidents last year when he was seen as F1&apos;s loose cannon: quick \u2013 but liable to go off in your face. He drove a magnificent race at Suzuka, a brilliant start, followed by a flawless period of leading with Webber on his tail ready to pounce on a circuit that punishes any errors. Both Vettel and Webber passed him in the end but he was struggling with the harder tyres and his spot on the podium was fully justified, while his performances this year even earned Webber&apos;s approval after the race. Most importantly this was no flash in the pan. His pace has never been in doubt, but this season, especially in the second half he has shown the maturity, focus and confidence to really make an impact. The last two races he has driven superbly, not only here in Japan but when he was pipped into third by Kimi Raikkonen in Korea only after he lost his lead over the Finn behind the safety car. He has also out-qualified Raikkonen in five of the past six races. Lotus may have lost the latter to Ferrari but after all those weekends when team principal Eric Boullier and his team must have wondered whether it was worth persevering with Grosjean, their patience looks like being rewarded. Which leaves the question of who will partner him there? Again answered emphatically at Suzuka by Nico H\u00fclkenberg, who also drove the wheels off his Sauber. The German was at the centre of the battle for the middle points spots and unafraid of going wheel-to-wheel with Alonso. The Sauber is no slouch and has improved recently but H\u00fclkenberg is working it to great effect. A fourth place in Korea matched his career best and his sixth at Suzuka meant that he has now been out of the points only twice since the British Grand Prix. All of which makes it rather unfair that his fate might be decided by the arbitrary matter of being rather tall. Height equals weight and, with next season&apos;s new powertrains appearing to be heavier than expected, taller drivers may well take cars over the minimum weight limit. Others have spoken out on the subject, including Jenson Button, another tall fellow, although it seems unlikely to be resolved until 2015. With each additional 10 kilos costing around 0.3sec a lap, some teams have been hesitant over pursuing H\u00fclkenberg but Boullier has already said he does not believe a driver&apos;s weight would be an issue, insisting his engineers would find a way to save it elsewhere. However he and Lotus are still attempting to finalise a deal for financing for next year, so for the moment the Hulk, who is making all the right moves on track, must wait."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/14/bob-bush-obituary", "sentences": ["He joined the RAF in 1940 and was posted with a radar unit to Singapore, where life was fairly enjoyable until early 1942, when the island was invaded by the Japanese."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T15:03:17Z", "title": "Bob Bush obituary", "tags": ["Second world war", "Sunderland"], "article": "My father, Bob Bush, who has died aged 97, was one of the last survivors of the prisoners of war who worked on the notorious Burma railway. He joined the RAF in 1940 and was posted with a radar unit to Singapore, where life was fairly enjoyable until early 1942, when the island was invaded by the Japanese. Bob was one of the last to leave and often recalled how someone came rushing up to him, crying that the enemy was approaching and to get to the docks straightaway. He managed to escape on a river steamer which was bombed, machine-gunned and sunk. I still have the water-stained New Testament given to him by his family, with a photograph of my mother, Mary, in the back, which he was carrying in his pocket. With other shipwrecked people, including women and children, he swam to a deserted island. Eventually, they were picked up by a Chinese junk and taken to Sumatra, where they were captured by the Japanese. Three hard years followed. There was little food, the prisoners witnessed appalling atrocities and they were used as slave labour on the Burma railway; many people died. In 1985 Bob participated in a pilgrimage to Thailand, revisiting the River Kwai and seeing the graves of colleagues he remembered as young men. The son of a woodman and Methodist preacher, Lacy James Bush, and his wife Harriet (nee Mills), Bob lived most of his adult life in Shotton, a colliery village in east Durham. He passed the 11-plus, but financial pressure meant that he left school early. He joined the local Co-op as a draper, staying for more than 30 years. I remember him buying, as drapery manager, black mourning attire for the families of the 83 men lost in the 1951 Easington colliery disaster. At the age of 54, having taken O-levels at night school, Bob went to Sunderland Polytechnic to train as a teacher. He taught geography at Easington comprehensive, where he championed underachievers and was a popular and inspiring member of staff. Retirement presented him with new opportunities. At 70, Bob was awarded a degree from Sunderland University. This was sufficiently noteworthy at that time for his photograph to appear on the cover of the Times Higher Education supplement. When Bob was 90, Lord Puttnam, chancellor of Sunderland University, presented him with the chancellor&apos;s award for lifelong learning, describing Bob as a true exemplar of the expression &quot;it&apos;s never too late to learn&quot;. Mary died in 1988 and Bob&apos;s second wife, Doris, died in 2007. He is survived by me, two granddaughters, Anna and Kate, and five great-grandchildren."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/oct/14/uk-retailers-relaxed-visas-chinese-visitors", "sentences": ["Recent growth has been fuelled by international shoppers from China and south-east Asia, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand, lured by the tax-free benefits of shopping in the UK and London in particular."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T15:22:47Z", "title": "Overseas shoppers: who spends what in the UK", "tags": ["Consumer affairs", "Money", "Retail industry", "Business", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "UK retailers and tourism bosses have welcomed the chancellor&apos;s pledge to relax visa restrictions to make it easier for wealthy Chinese shoppers to splash their cash in the UK. The simplification of visitor paperwork could boost UK revenues generated by Chinese shoppers by an estimated \u00a31.2bn a year if the country could perform as well as France in attracting Chinese visitors, according to the New West End Company, which represents the capital&apos;s flagship shops in Regent Street, Bond Street and Oxford Street. Recent growth has been fuelled by international shoppers from China and south-east Asia, including Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand, lured by the tax-free benefits of shopping in the UK and London in particular. That means sought-after goods such as Louis Vuitton handbags, Hermes silk scarves and Burberry trenchcoats can be up to 30% cheaper in the UK than in China. Richard Brown, vice-president of Global Blue UK, which tracks spending by tourists from outside Europe, said: &quot;These tourists are increasingly targeting the UK as a place to spend their growing wealth.&quot; The World Tourism Organisation has reported that the number of Chinese tourists travelling abroad increased from 10 million in 2000 to 83 million in 2012. About half of them spend more than \u00a33,000 a trip and account for 25% of sales of luxury goods around the world, giving them considerable economic clout. Chinese visitors spend on average three times more than any other nationality on luxury goods while visiting London \u2013 typically top-of-the-range handbags, shoes, watches and expensive knick-knacks. At John Lewis, the Chinese are the number one spenders in international tax-free sales, with their spending last year accounting for 10% of total international tax-free spend at the retailer \u2013 up 19% on the previous year. The Chinese also represented 12% of the total number of transactions at John Lewis, up 12% on the previous year. Who spends most money in the UK? Figures from VisitBritain and Global Blue show that these are the nationalities who spend most when they visit the UK. Transaction figures include spending on hotels, shopping and all other expenditure. 1. Middle East Middle Eastern shoppers spend an average of \u00a3766 per transaction in the UK. They favour limited edition and luxury brands, particularly, handbags, shoes, watches and fine jewellery. Many luxury retailers based in the UK offer special treatment to Middle Eastern shoppers including VIP rooms for services like tax-free shopping, personal shoppers, translators, and free coffee and tea. 2. China The Chinese are prepared to spend a higher proportion than any other group of their holiday outlay on retail, with average spend per transation at \u00a3663. They are motivated buyers as a result of the high tariffs and taxes on luxury goods sold in China, a strong Yuan, and a preference for buying in markets with fewer counterfeit goods and a better selection. European luxury products tend to be 20%-30% cheaper in the UK than in China. 3. Thailand The Chinese boom is inspiring greater consumer confidence in other emerging economies, most notably Thailand, where the cachet for buying British is driving growth. Their shopping patterns are similar to the Chinese, with a desire for well-known superbrands including Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Ferragamo. Thai tourists have an average spend of \u00a3661 and favour leather luggage and travel accessories. Stores are now offering cultural training and hiring Thai speaking staff to create a comfortable experience for Thai shoppers. 4. Russia High net worth Russian shoppers typically seek culture, luxury brands and boutique shops when visiting the UK. Status-orientated and prepared to pay high prices, they also expect high standards in return. About 60% of Russians make shopping their number one leisure activity when visiting the UK, spending on average \u00a3597 per transaction. The luxury brands they favour are Christian Dior, Versace and Prada. 5. Nigeria A growing Nigerian population in the UK and more frequent direct flights has led to an influx of visitors who are spending more due to a booming oil-driven economy. Nigerians spend on average \u00a3573 per transaction and in-store sales to them have risen by 5% over the past six months. Nigerian visitors want to spend not just on luxury, but also at mass market chains including Marks &amp; Spencer and even Prada, as they get better value over here. Nigeria is Britain&apos;s second largest trade market in Africa, and 30% of visits to Britain are business-related."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/oct/14/royal-mail-share-investors-300-profit", "sentences": ["The Guardian understands that 13.5% of the company was bought by foreign investors, including the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait, Singapore and Norway."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T17:53:44Z", "title": "Royal Mail share investors set to make \u00a3300 profit with new price surge", "tags": ["Royal Mail", "Business", "Postal service", "UK news", "Investing", "Financial sector", "Privatisation", "Politics", "Economic policy", "Shares", "Investments", "Money", "Trade unions", "Ed Miliband", "Labour", "Vince Cable"], "article": "Hundreds of thousands of small investors could make a profit of more than \u00a3300 on Royal Mail stock on Tuesday morning following a further surge in the company&apos;s shares on their second day of trading. Around 350,000 shareholders who bought their stakes through a government website \u2013 out of a total of 690,000 retail investors \u2013 receive their share certificates on Tuesday, allowing them to cash in on the float&apos;s instant success. The shares, which the government sold for 330p on Friday morning, closed at 475p on Monday night \u2013 20p higher than at the end of trading on Friday. The 44% jump in the launch share price means that 227 shares bought from the government for \u00a3749.10 \u2013 the allocation for every retail investor \u2013 are now worth \u00a31,078. Danny Cox, of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said he expected Tuesday&apos;s trading activity to be as busy as Friday, when more than 100m shares were traded in the first hour. David Jones, chief market strategist at spread betting firm IG Index, said: &quot;We&apos;re expecting a similar level of excitement as in the first hour on Friday.&quot; Those who bought shares directly from the government will have to pay \u00a317.50 to sell their shares online. People who bought through a broker could sell the shares for a fee as low as \u00a312. Jones said many of the buyers are wealthy individuals who failed to buy any Royal Mail shares after the government decided to block applications from anyone who ordered more than \u00a310,000 worth of shares. &quot;The most active [buyers] are high net worth clients who missed out on the allocations they wanted,&quot; he said. Until now the shares could only be bought and sold via stockbrokers. The company will be fully listed on the London Stock Exchange at 8am on Tuesday triggering &quot;unconditional dealing&quot; \u2013 allowing anyone to buy and sell. About 40 people applied for shares worth \u00a31m or more. City investors, including pension funds and hedge funds, have also been big buyers of the stock after 500 of the 800 institutions that applied for shares failed to get any following overwhelming demand. The proportion available to institutions was reduced from 70% to 67% to make slightly more stock available to the public. The government said 90% of the shares sold to the City have gone to &quot;responsible institutional investors&quot; such as pension funds. Investors include Threadneedle, Fidelity, Blackrock and Standard Life. The remaining 10% went to hedge funds, including Lansdowne Partners. The Guardian understands that 13.5% of the company was bought by foreign investors, including the sovereign wealth funds of Kuwait, Singapore and Norway. Private investors may be extra keen to sell their shares before the result of a strike ballot of postal workers due on Wednesday afternoon. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said it is &quot;almost certain&quot; that its 115,000 members will vote for industrial action. A nationwide strike, the first since 2009, could be held as soon as 23 October. It comes despite 150,000 postal workers making paper profits of more than \u00a3900 from the \u00a32,200 of shares they were granted for free as part of the privatisation. Billy Hayes, general secretary of the CWU, said: &quot;Shares will make no scintilla of difference to postal workers who are far more concerned about their jobs. We expect our members will vote to protect their terms and conditions. It&apos;s more important than ever to get protections for job security and terms and conditions under privatisation. CWU won&apos;t stand idly by; whoever owns the company will have to deal with us and the workforce.&quot; The union will hold a mass meeting outside Royal Mail&apos;s Mount Pleasant sorting office in central London on Tuesday morning to coincide with the start of full trading in the company&apos;s shares on the Stock Exchange. Brokers said the threatened strike action \u2013 which could lead to days of disruption in the run up to Christmas \u2013 has already been factored into Royal Mail&apos;s share price. The attraction of a 6% dividend yield could also persuade retail investors to hold on to their shares rather than sell them, despite a note from analysts at Canaccord Genuity arguing that the shares should be priced at 599p. The soaring share price, which values Royal Mail at \u00a34.7bn compared with the government&apos;s maximum \u00a33.3bn valuation, has fuelled accusations that the government sold off the 500-year-old company too cheaply. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said it showed the privatisation was a &quot;fire sale of a great British institution&quot;. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, said the government had &quot;massively shortchanged&quot; taxpayers by significantly undervaluing the institution. If the government had sold the shares at 450p, rather than 330p, it would have made an extra \u00a3600m for the taxpayer on top of the \u00a31.7bn it made from the 52% stake in Royal Mail. The government&apos;s pricing of Royal Mail will be investigated by both the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, and the public accounts committee."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/15/fukuppy-fukushima-mascot-japan-fridge-egg-name", "sentences": ["He represents Fukushima Industries, a major manufacturer of industrial cooling systems based in Osaka that has offices throughout Japan and in many parts of Asia, including China and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-15T13:03:24Z", "title": "Meet Fukuppy, the inadvertent Fukushima mascot", "tags": ["Japan", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "It wasn&apos;t a refrigeration company&apos;s decision to use a cartoon egg with wings, of indeterminate gender and with &quot;a strong sense of justice&quot; as its corporate mascot that got Japan-based internet users giggling.

Nice to meet you,&quot; the mascot says on the company&apos;s website. The origins of Fukuppy, whose name combines the Japanese word for good fortune with letters from the English word &quot;happy&quot;, are far more mundane. He represents Fukushima Industries, a major manufacturer of industrial cooling systems based in Osaka that has offices throughout Japan and in many parts of Asia, including China and Singapore. The firm is named after its founder \u2013 a certain Mr Fukushima \u2013 whose name shares the kanji characters used to write the name of the tsunami-hit prefecture hundreds of miles away in Japan&apos;s north-east. On Tuesday, the company said the online sniggering over its mascot&apos;s name was the result of an innocent misunderstanding, adding that the character had no connection with the Fukushima region, although the firm does have a sales office there. &quot;A lot of media are reporting [on] our mascot, which created misunderstanding,&quot; a company spokeswoman told Agence France-Presse. &quot;In order to get rid of the confusion, we will announce our stance on the issue on our website later in the day.&quot; The firm issued a press release clearing up any misunderstanding and apologising for the commotion the media coverage had caused. Later in the day, the company had replaced the mascot&apos;s English name with its Japanese rendering.

On 16 and 17 January 2014 a host of influential and inspirational figures from across Southeast Asia and the rest of the world will gather in Singapore to discuss the role the open internet has to play in transforming the way we do business and the way we shape the world&apos;s future. From the new economics of content and the impact of entrepreneurial enterprise, to the realities of regional governance and the challenges of global development, digital technologies continue to fundamentally transform all areas of the world in which we live and work. Activate is the Guardian&apos;s platform for individuals and organisations working across all sectors who are using these technologies to disrupt, innovate and change. For our inaugural Southeast Asian Activate, we have built an exciting multi-disciplinary programme of presentations, debates and lightning pitches to look at a number of key themes, including: \u2022 How will the next phase of the web and the next wave of web entrepreneurs be funded? \u2022 How can the internet provide education to the whole world? \u2022 What role will mobile technologies have to play in the world&apos;s future? \u2022 How can technology help to stimulate growth, innovation, inclusion and equality in cities? \u2022 How is tech-led innovation reshaping our public services, governance strategies and civic engagement at a regional and global level? \u2022 How can we drive business innovation, growth and change through big data and the cloud? \u2022 How is the global, digital economy disrupting the creation, management, distribution and monetisation of content? In addition to the Activate Summit in Singapore, we will be hosting the Activate Tech Talent day on 16 January 2014. This year, we are looking for 10 tech startups (global and regional welcome) with world changing ideas to pitch themselves and their companies to our group of venture capitalists, angel investors and industry experts.

The stereotyped view is one of flashy over-consumption to match a glut of wealth from oil production. The story I heard on the ground was rather different. Ibrahim Al Zubi is head of sustainability at Majid Al Futtaim Properties (MAFP), which develops and manages some of the shopping malls the new Middle East is famous for, such as the Mall of the Emirates, which houses more than 500 retail brands. More than 100 million people visit MAFP malls every year. Al Zubi previously worked for the government and is associated with educational campaigns to raise awareness of issues such as climate change, as well as spearheading the development of unique and progressive standards. &quot;Our region is unique,&quot; Al Zubi told me. &quot;A lot of best practices have been absorbed from somewhere else, but the hybrid approach is always the best. Singapore would be the closest comparison \u2013 Dubai is setting the example for others to follow.&quot; The malls of the Middle East are famous for their gleaming modernity, their luxury stores and opulence. What is less well known is that construction in the Middle East is taking a lead in sustainability standards. One of MAFP&apos;s competitors, Msheireb, has a regeneration project in Qatar that will contain the largest cluster of LEED (green building standard)-certified buildings in the world: a total of 100 buildings all targeting gold and platinum status. Besides attention to individual buildings, the whole development is angled to catch a prevailing northwest breeze, creating a comfortable microclimate. Al Zubi told me that the region has gone from playing catch-up to setting a lead. MAFP&apos;s Mall of the Emirates is not only a top 10 global mall in business terms, it is also one of the only malls in the world with a LEED gold award. It helps that the region is booming again, after a hiatus during the credit crunch. But Ibrahim also told me that it is &quot;different from 10 years ago&quot; \u2013 the environmental standards have become perceived as an integral sign of quality and, crucially, they have been adapted to local conditions. What is &quot;eco&quot; for a building in (cold and wet) Great Britain may not even be relevant in (hot and dry) Dubai. LEED (from the US) and the BREEAM standard (a UK equivalent) form a basic international reference point for development in the region. But Middle East governments, Al Zubi explained, have also developed their own standards to reflect local conditions, needs and challenges. Abu Dhabi has developed PEARL, and Qatar has QSAS, part of which has already been made mandatory. That&apos;s a fairly straightforward account, but Al Zubi warned me against oversimplification: &quot;It takes a lot of research to understand the region properly.&quot; The work of governments in setting these standards has provided a common base for defining quality, he said. His time in government was &quot;more like working for an NGO&quot;, and governments had applied the standards first to their own buildings. In the United Arab Emirates, &quot;all new government buildings must be at least two-star&quot; \u2013 this in turn has helped to create a local green building market, boosting skills and training. The other important factor, Al Zubi told me, was private-development companies such as MAFP being family-owned: &quot;It is never just profit, or just passion; it is always both.&quot; Perhaps, though, he added, we would have heard more of this passion from the region if there had not been a stringent culture of modesty. As Al Zubi pointed out: &quot;Qatar gave over $11bn to foreign aid last year, [but] you would never hear them making a song and dance about it. A lot of that kind of thing is not captured. It&apos;s one of the things the family companies do right, keeping a low profile. You won&apos;t see any annual reports detailing how many orphans we have helped \u2013 &apos;showing what you have done&apos; is not the Muslim way.&quot; Al Zubi pointed out that with 60% of the population under 30 and high unemployment in some countries in the region, creating jobs is actually the number one priority for a family-owned company such as his. The mall they are developing in Lebanon will create 2,000 jobs in retail alone.  And on the social side of sustainability, Al Zubi said there had been rapid moves to make sure health, training and worker safety are in accordance with the highest standards \u2013 something the region has been criticised for. Al Zubi said the key goal that governments and companies such his are aligned on is the need to foster entrepreneurship. Previous generations could rely on safe jobs in government or corporate-style companies, but the prospects of a new generation will depend far more on entrepreneurship. The governments in UAE have committed to awarding at least 10% of all their own contracts to SMEs, and Al Zubi told me that many are expecting a small business and entrepreneurship boom across the region. Boosting this local culture of entrepreneurship, Al Zubi told me that the result was something like a reverse brain drain, bringing people with education and experience of best practices from elsewhere in the world back into the region.

Photograph: Alamy    Next week, MPs on the House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee will dust off their crystal balls and start taking evidence for its  inquiry into government horizon scanning. This follows on from a comprehensive  review of horizon scanning led by the chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Jon Day, which reported earlier this year.  The Day Review concluded that &quot;the UK does not lack the resources to conduct horizon scanning, but needs to improve upon and formalise the structure for directing work and making use&quot; of such tools. Picking up on this challenge, the Commons S&amp;T Committee is keen to understand how horizon scanning across government can be strengthened, and how such information can be given appropriate attention, despite the relentless daily demands on ministers&apos; and senior officials&apos; time. John Maynard Keynes once observed that &quot;in the long run we are all dead&quot;. And it is of course true that uncertainties about the future, and the never-ending immediacy of the political and media cycle, make it easy to rationalise living in the eternal present. Finding it hard to lift our sights and look one, two or more decades ahead is a problem that is by no means unique to government in the UK.  Shifting focus towards the longer term requires policy makers and others to devote sustained attention to the transformational changes that will shape the future for the next generations. Understanding these changes, while at the same time identifying why progress on other fronts remains so slow, is the focus of Now for the Long Term , the report of the Oxford Martin Commission for Future Generations, which is published today.  Chaired by Pascal Lamy, until recently director general of the World Trade Organisation, the Oxford Martin Commission brought together  a group of eminent leaders from 13 countries, drawn from government, business and civil society. Over the past 12 months, the commission has grappled with how governments can more adeptly manage their dual responsibilities: to address the immediate needs of their citizens, while also building the foundations for more sustainable and inclusive development in the decades ahead.  Our recommendations emphasise the importance of innovative partnerships, openness and accountability, and underline the need to step beyond crisis management to address longer-term problems and solutions. Some are directed at immediate policy debates, like climate change or cybersecurity. Others address deeper political and cultural dynamics that prevent progress. As the select committee considers how best to scan the horizon, we hope our report might provide useful food for thought.  To enable governments to &quot;focus more on steering rather than rowing&quot;, we recommend that they invest in innovative institutions that remain accountable but able to operate across longer-term time horizons. Such institutions should ideally be independent and insulated from some of the day-to-day pressures of governing, leaving them able to conduct systematic reviews and analysis of longer-term issues that will impact their country and region. Essential areas of policy formulation, evaluation and implementation could benefit from more devolved authority and decentralised delivery. Useful models include infrastructure and urban planning authorities like those in Australia and Singapore, and the Tennessee Valley Authority in the US.  Here in the UK,  the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and  the Office for Budget Responsibility apply similar principles to health and fiscal policy. Advisory bodies such as the (now defunct)  Royal Commission for Environmental Pollution (RCEP) and commissions on low pay and pensions (which ran between 2002 and 2006) are additional UK examples of arms-length institutions that have been able to tackle sensitive issues and support a more informed, less polarised debate. The design of such institutions must meet fundamental standards of legitimacy and effectiveness. Political debate and decision-making processes can benefit from transparent and independent expert advice, provided it remains subject to appropriate accountability and oversight by parliaments or other bodies. Cross-party consensus and support of the agenda and objectives of such independent agencies is vital to underpin their stability, longevity, impartiality and effectiveness. Beyond independent institutions, our report recommends that sunset clauses be built into all public-funded international institutions to ensure that their mandate is relevant and fit for 21st century purposes. We highlight the need for governments to open up politics through more civil engagement, influence, monitoring and participation in longer-term issues. And we call for businesses to accept that they too bear responsibility for our collective future. Companies and financial systems must give greater priority to long-term metrics of societal health and well being, and place less weight on quarterly returns and short-term incentive bonuses.  For our commission, this report is the beginning of a conversation that we hope will shift perspectives towards the longer term. The future will always be uncertain, but we need to ensure that we have the skills, tools and institutions needed to guide us on the journey.

Tony feels insufficiently reverential. What do people call you?  Tony. How was China? (1) Oh, I loved it. It was so different, so educational. In Singapore, for instance, as the plane lands they say: &quot;If you&apos;re coming into this country with any drugs, the penalty is death.&quot; That&apos;s a pretty stern warning. Well, I think it [legalising of drugs] should be done everywhere. It eliminates the underworld. If they had been legal in the 70s, would that have affected your experiences with drugs? (2) As a young boy I did a lot of foolish things. I made a lot of mistakes. And you live and learn. I&apos;m very content now. I&apos;m just being a normal human being. It&apos;s been 50 years since you won your first Grammy, for I Left My Heart in San Francisco. Ella Fitzgerald and Ray Charles were there at the ceremony \u2026 That was one of the first times the Grammys were on \u2013 since then I&apos;ve received 17 Grammys. I love it because it&apos;s the only time the music world has a convention, and you meet everyone that you know and love. You must have mixed with them all. I lived for 15 years in Los Angeles and I still can&apos;t believe that the handsomest man in the world, Cary Grant, and the greatest performer in the world, Fred Astaire, and Johnny Carson, one after another \u2013 they were all in my home at different times. I celebrated my 50th birthday with them. Unforgettable. Did any of them do anything in your home that you&apos;ve had to keep secret? No. But once Dean Martin was in his home, having this mad party, and he was trying to study his lines for a television show so he called up the police and said: &quot;I&apos;m Dean Martin&apos;s neighbour and there&apos;s too much noise coming from his house. Have the police come and slow down the party.&quot; And the police came and broke the party up and he got rid of everybody in the house. Someone once wrote: &quot;Sinatra was hip, but Tony was cool.&quot; I never heard that. I thought he was pretty cool. He was 10 years older than I was and he was my idol, and when he announced that I was his favourite singer, it made all of his fans come and check me out. I&apos;ve been sold out ever since. Were you nervous when you first met him? Yeah. I respected him so much. I respected Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra. Those were my heroes, and they were 10 years older than I was. To this day, I can&apos;t believe I got to meet Ella personally. Nat Cole was a great friend, and Sinatra endorsed me throughout his whole life. In terms of the development of 20th-century music: Sinatra or Presley? You can&apos;t compare them. Presley is country music, white music. Jazz is black music \u2013 it was invented by the blacks in New Orleans. And I&apos;m really a jazz singer. I was impressed with Elvis \u2013 he was the handsomest guy I ever met in my life, and a very nice person, too. But the music doesn&apos;t impress me. How does Amy Winehouse (3) compare to the Ellas and Lena Hornes and Billie Holidays? You can&apos;t compare, but she was an authentic jazz singer, which is tremendous because jazz has been underrated. There&apos;s still so much bigotry. You were once invited to go and sing in Harlem with Billie Holiday, but didn&apos;t go ...  It was one night when she asked me to come up and sing with her and I was with a group of people at a table, and they looked at me as if to say: &quot;Don&apos;t go up to Harlem, it&apos;s not safe there.&quot; And it was very bigoted. I regret it to this day that I didn&apos;t go. Is it true you were so moved by Charlie Parker the first time you saw him play live, you threw up? Yeah, I regurgitated. It was so phenomenal, so emphatic \u2026 It was more music than I ever heard anyone play at one time. I just couldn&apos;t believe how great it was. Do you think subsequent generations might have had that response to Jimi Hendrix or Kurt Cobain? It&apos;s a different thing. You have to understand, Charlie Parker, that music lasts for ever. It&apos;s like Louis Armstrong \u2013 some of the records he made with different orchestras, the orchestras sound old-fashioned but Louis sounds like today, right now. Classical trumpet players in symphonic orchestras would listen to him and say, &quot;How did he do that?&quot; and try to learn how to play like him. Who else has had that effect? As an entertainer, I think Jimmy Durante  (4). He was better than anybody. He tried to make people feel good. I like that. I could have retired 20 years ago, but I didn&apos;t because I like to make people feel good. For a fun night out, Judy Garland or Lady Gaga? Both of them are good. Lady Gaga is the Picasso of the entertainment world. She&apos;s very intelligent. You&apos;re known as a natty dresser. But do you ever pop out in jeans and an old cardie? I was honoured last year as the Best Dressed Man in Britain (5). It was quite a compliment. I have relaxed clothes, but people don&apos;t see me in them. I&apos;m a painter, I have a studio and it can be messy so I wear a smock. If you went out for a pint of milk in that smock probably nobody would recognise you. I wouldn&apos;t do that. People who do that are ridiculous. My mum taught me as a child, even though we were very poor, she said: &quot;Put on a nice clean white shirt and nice black pants and you&apos;ll be OK.&quot; Which would be more painful to give up: singing or painting? Both of them. If something happened with me physically, I would still love to spend the rest of my life painting. I&apos;ve never worked a day in my life. People don&apos;t believe that, but it&apos;s true. I love what I&apos;m doing because I&apos;m doing the two things I love. I never felt in my whole life like, &quot;I don&apos;t feel like doing that today&quot;. I wake up and I can&apos;t wait to paint and I can&apos;t wait to learn something about music. How many presidents have you met? I think about 13. No, 10. I didn&apos;t sing for Nixon, I was in Europe at the time and had to pass on the invitation. Who was the most impressive? President Clinton. You could walk up to him with your hands in your pocket and say,:&quot;Hi, Bill.&quot; You don&apos;t say &quot;Mr President&quot;, you don&apos;t bow. He&apos;s a regular person. You once described your experience in the second world war as &quot;a front seat in hell&quot;. It&apos;s legalised murder. I&apos;m anti-war. Life is more beautiful than that. Guys who create wars should get their hands slapped. Did you have a difficult childhood? Yeah, we grew up during the Depression. My mother worked a penny a dress to put food on the table for her three children because my father died when I was very young. It was very tough. How do you keep up with your wife, by the way? I&apos;ve read that she&apos;s variously 33 and 40 years younger than you \u2026 (6) We get along beautifully. We started schools all over America, we now have 17 where we support the performing arts (7). She&apos;s a magnificent person and I love everything about her. She must keep you young. She can&apos;t!

The City regulator will decide after its informal analysis of evidence presented in the court of appeal on Thursday whether it should launch a formal investigation into the bank&apos;s involvement in the Libor market. It may decide not to do so. A long-running case between Barclays and private health care provider Guardian Care Homes has led to allegations being raised in legal papers at the appeal court as part of the health company&apos;s attempt to have two interest rate swaps invalidated. &quot;The FCA will look at the documents, as would be expected,&quot; the regulator said. Guardian Care Homes had loans worth \u00a370m from Barclays and alleges the bank mis-sold it interest rate swaps based on Libor that ended up costing it millions as interest rates fell. Barclays denies mis-selling and says the Libor-rigging allegations are irrelevant to the dispute. In legal papers filed to the court, Guardian Care Homes cites a letter from Barclays&apos; lawyers to the Singapore regulator containing details of an internal investigation by the bank between January 2006 and April 2010 into Libor. According to Guardian Care Homes, the inquiry found that ex-Barclays employee Quan Hui Lee, now working at an investment fund run by Barclays called Ricardo Master Fund, had asked bank staff to manipulate the rate to boost the fund&apos;s returns. &quot;Go get Libor down,&quot; Lee was cited as saying. In another email, Lee was quoted as saying: &quot;LOWER! Go for 3 percent ... I want yr end 3mL (three-month Libor) to be 2.8 percent or at worst 2.88 percent.&quot; Citing the contents of the letter from Barclays lawyers to the Monetary Authority of Singapore, dated May 9, 2013, Guardian Care Homes said: &quot;The purpose of the fraud was to make profit or avoid losses on &apos;Ricardo Master Fund&apos;&quot;. Barclays is trying to have the Libor-related elements of the case thrown out by the appeal court, which is hearing the case in conjunction with a similar dispute between Deutsche Bank and Indian real estate developer Unitech. &quot;[The case] is not concerned with the extent to which Barclays manipulated Libor or the regulators&apos; reports,&quot; the bank&apos;s lead counsel Robin Dicker told the court. &quot;It is concerned with a much narrower issue, whether Guardian Care Homes can rely on such conduct to avoid or reduce its obligations.&quot; The three court of appeal judges are due to give their ruling later this year. A spokesman for Barclays said: &quot;The bank has chosen not to object to the introduction of new evidence to the court of appeal hearing, however the bank does not consider any of the new evidence to be relevant to the issues in front of the court of appeal.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/18/thinktanks-kurt-campbell-lowy-institute", "sentences": ["There were also no questions about Campbell\u2019s Washington and Singapore-based investment organisation, the Asia Group, and its efforts to win lucrative contracts across the Asia-Pacific region."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-18T04:44:34Z", "title": "It's time we stopped drinking the thinktank kool-aid | Antony Loewenstein", "tags": ["Australia news", "US politics", "Business", "Thinktanks"], "article": "The ABC TV Lateline interview with Kurt Campbell, former US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, was\u00a0cordial, even reverential. It was conducted in the middle of March this year, more than a month after Campbell had left the state department. Interviewer Emma Alberici asked Campbell about the transformation of Burma and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. He gushed that it was remarkable, and gave some folksy anecdotes about a \u201cbetter future\u201d for the Burmese. The interview then swiftly moved on to focus on the prospects of Hillary Clinton running for president in 2016.\u00a0There were no questions about\u00a0Campbell\u2019s push for greater ties\u00a0with the Indonesian military\u00a0despite its\u00a0shocking record of abuse in West Papua.\u00a0 There were also no questions about Campbell\u2019s Washington and Singapore-based investment organisation, the Asia Group, and its efforts to win lucrative contracts across the Asia-Pacific region. After all, his company had been launched before this interview took place and surely warranted some questions about the appropriateness of setting up a company so soon after leaving government. It might be considered an example of the unwillingness of the mainstream media to challenge potential conflicts of interest when it comes to the murky melding of business and politics. With the announcement in August by the Lowy Institute that Campbell was its\u00a02013 distinguished international fellow, it\u2019s vital to question the ways in which our media has drunk the thinktank kool-aid.\u00a0 The Lowy Institute sees itself as Australia\u2019s leading foreign affairs thinktank. Its fellows and staff routinely appear in the media\u00a0pontificating about global affairs, including a push for greater defence spending\u00a0that would allow countless contractors\u00a0to earn billions of dollars.\u00a0Its head Michael Fullilove, who&apos;s also a non-resident senior fellow in foreign affairs at the Brookings Institution,\u00a0writes longingly\u00a0about former US national security advisor Henry Kissinger as a \u201crealist\u201d, despite there being questions over Kissinger&apos;s record of foreign policy. Kissinger endorsed Fullilove\u2019s recent book, a love letter to Franklin D Roosevelt.\u00a0Fullilove has also been an\u00a0outspoken critic\u00a0of the release of the Wikileaks cables. When former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard recently announced that she had been made a senior fellow at the\u00a0Brookings Institution, I could find no local news story that explained what the thinktank was. Glenn Greenwald has\u00a0pithily written\u00a0that &quot;Brookings is a classic example of that sprawling strain of Washington thinktank culture that exist for little reason other than to serve and justify government power.\u201d\u00a0 The US-based Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting group\u00a0investigated\u00a0the influence of corporate and foundation money on thinktanks and their spokepeople, and urged an examination of their fundings in the areas of climate change, war, arms manufacturing and energy policy. Frustratingly, interviewers rarely get past the bland soundbite from their guests.\u00a0As an example, the\u00a0Public Accountability Initiative\u00a0released a report this month that found a number many of the expert voices calling for military action against Syria in the US were linked to the weapons industry and\u00a0would financially benefit from a US strike. However, in the vast bulk of media appearances, outlets failed to disclose these business interests. In Australia, the questions around the independence of thinktanks started with the establishment of Sydney University\u2019s United States Studies Centre in 2006. At its launch dinner, Rupert Murdoch said that \u201cAustralians must resist and reject the facile, reflexive, unthinking anti-Americanism that has gripped much of Europe\u201d. The media today\u00a0laps up its views,\u00a0despite questions around the Centre Sydney University allowing itself to be\u00a0funded by politically friendly parties.\u00a0 The US Studies Centre is supported by a range of corporate interests, including the\u00a0Dow Chemical Company Foundation,\u00a0\u201cto support a three-year research program on sustainability.\u201d A key aim of Dow is to push genetically modified foods, and to oppose complete\u00a0labelling of GM foods in the US.\u00a0People should take these connections into account when evaluating any US Studies Centre face that appears in our media to talk dispassionately about the environment. But back to Kurt Campbell. In May 2013, his company the Asia Group was one of the bidders on Yangon International Airport, a $1bn project. In July 2012, Campbell had successfully convinced the Obama administration while he was still in government\u00a0to lift an investment ban on Burma, allowing US firms to make a fortune in the country. This led to Foreign Policy\u2019s The Cable wondering whether The Asia Group had some\u00a0conflict of interest questions to answer, leading company COO Nirav Patel to claim that Campbell\u2019s activities in the country had been \u201cextremely consistent\u201d for years. \u201cThis is intrinsically about supporting reform,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can&apos;t get to supporting reform without people taking [investment] risks. That&apos;s something we&apos;re very passionate about.\u201d In the end, a Korean consortium, Incheon,\u00a0won the airport tender. There are no suggestions of illegal behaviour by Campbell or his company. But questions can be asked over the appropriateness of setting up a consulting firm shortly after leaving government, and then potentially making money from relationships established during his time as a public servant. My many requests for comment from Campbell and the Asia Group went unanswered. I asked the Lowy Institute a range of questions about Campbell\u2019s possible conflicts of interest. They sent me a statement that ignored these issues:  Dr Campbell has long been one of the United States&apos; foremost policymakers on Asia. As assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, he played a leading role on issues such at the US &quot;rebalance&quot; towards Asia, US-China relations, and efforts to promote democratic change in Burma. This fellowship will provide the international policy community in Australia with an opportunity to draw upon Dr Campbell&apos;s experience and insights on the defining political, economic and strategic issues in Asia at a time of great change in the region. It will also be an opportunity to expose Dr Campbell to Australian perspectives on these issues.  Business and politics rarely mix without controversy; the media needs to be careful not to be seduced by smooth thinktank talkers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/oct/18/activate-singapore-essential-information", "sentences": ["Venue Address: Marina Bay Sands Singapore10 Bayfront AvenueSingapore 018956 Click here for a map of the venue Delegate Prices: Package A (17th January) Standard Rate: SGD $750 Early Bird Rate (booking before 30th November 2013): SGD $650 Group Booking (bookings of three or more): SGD $600 Rate includes Full Day Activate Summit Package + Lunch Networking + Cocktails Package B (16th January) Standard Rate: SGD $350 Early Bird Rate (booking before 30th November 2013): SGD $300 Group Booking (bookings of three or more): SGD $250 Rate includes Full Day Tech Talent Competition + Refreshments and is aimed at startups, aspiring entrepreneurs, government agencies and investment companies Package C (Two-day 16th and 17th January) Standard Rate: SGD $950 Early Bird Rate (booking before 30th November 2013): SGD $850 Group Booking (bookings of three or more): SGD $800 Rate includes Full Two Day Package - Activate Summit + Lunch Networking + Cocktails + Tech Talent Day  Click here to book your place &gt;&gt; * Delegates residing in Singapore will be charged 7% GST."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-18T11:54:04Z", "title": "Activate Singapore: Essential Information", "tags": ["Activate Singapore", "Media & Tech Network"], "article": "Venue Address: Marina Bay Sands Singapore10 Bayfront AvenueSingapore 018956 Click here for a map of the venue Delegate Prices: Package A (17th January) Standard Rate: SGD $750 Early Bird Rate (booking before 30th November 2013): SGD $650 Group Booking (bookings of three or more): SGD $600 Rate includes Full Day Activate Summit Package + Lunch Networking + Cocktails Package B (16th January) Standard Rate: SGD $350 Early Bird Rate (booking before 30th November 2013): SGD $300 Group Booking (bookings of three or more): SGD $250 Rate includes Full Day Tech Talent Competition + Refreshments and is aimed at startups, aspiring entrepreneurs, government agencies and investment companies Package C (Two-day 16th and 17th January) Standard Rate: SGD $950 Early Bird Rate (booking before 30th November 2013): SGD $850 Group Booking (bookings of three or more): SGD $800 Rate includes Full Two Day Package - Activate Summit + Lunch Networking + Cocktails + Tech Talent Day  Click here to book your place &gt;&gt; * Delegates residing in Singapore will be charged 7% GST.

In January, the European Union (EU) declared 2013 the Year of Air, and planned to focus on actions to improve air quality across the EU. Although numerous steps have been made to control emissions of harmful substances over recent years, the burning of fossil fuels and the dramatic rise in road traffic, means the problem still very much remains. To put it quickly into context, air pollution is now cited as the main cause of lung conditions, such as asthma, and is estimated to cause 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. The link to heart failure It&apos;s well known that air pollution is a risk factor for poor cardiovascular health. Studies have already demonstrated its link to heart attacks. However, only recently has air pollution been linked to heart failure, making it worse in those who already have it, as well as contributing to the development of the condition. A systematic review, published in The Lancet, has demonstrated a strong association between exposure to air pollution and admissions to hospital with heart failure or death from heart failure. The researchers estimated that reducing average daily concentrations of particulate matter, a type of air pollutant, by 3.9mcg/m3 would prevent around 8,000 hospitalisations for heart failure every year in the US. The study, which pooled the results of 35 observational studies, found an association between short-term increases in particulate matter and the risk of hospitalisation and death for congestive heart failure. In those patients who already had chronic heart congestion, hypertension or arrhythmia, the effect of air pollution was even more evident. And it&apos;s not just those who already have existing heart conditions that may be affected by air pollution. Recent research has suggested that air pollution also plays a role in the development of the condition. The study found that long-term exposure to air pollution, particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, was associated with an increased risk of heart failure. Is enough being done? Many studies have shown that living or attending a school close to a busy road can have an adverse effect on health. In adults, high levels of air pollution from busy roads can increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, and in children, increase the risk of asthma, allergies and other respiratory problems. But what is being done to address this? As populations grow and the percentage of people who live in cities increases, how can we protect them? Surely the public should be alerted when pollution levels are high? And I&apos;m not talking about waiting until it reaches a crisis level, such as we witnessed in Singapore earlier this year. Studies are revealing again and again that people are still at risk from air pollution, despite air quality limit values being in place. A global problem Although the studies discussed concern Europe, air pollution is a global problem in both developing and developed regions of the world. It&apos;s a public health issue that should remain a key target for global health policies. We need to consider other sources of energy for cars, and both industry and domestic use. Air pollution has now reached a level where we need to use alternative energy options on a grander scale; electricity, wind energy or nuclear energy, instead of fossil fuels. The European Respiratory Society&apos;s ten principles for clean air state: &quot;citizens are entitled to clean air, just like clean water and safe food&quot;. The need to reduce air pollution has been recognised but is 2013 the Year of Air? Figures and statistics are yet to confirm this, but my gut feeling is that we still have a long way to go.

In this small, Muslim-majority sultanate where alcohol and live music are banned, the cinema is often the most exciting place to be. The south-east Asian country&apos;s five cinemas almost always showcase Hollywood blockbusters and Malaysian or Indonesian dramedies. But next year something entirely different will be hitting the screens: Brunei&apos;s first ever commercial feature film. Yasmine is a coming-of-age tale about a girl who wants to become a champion at silat \u2013 Brunei&apos;s hypnotic and dance-like answer to kung fu. It represents a number of firsts for this country of 406,000: not only is the $2m project Brunei&apos;s first ever box-office movie, it is being directed by the country&apos;s first female director and stars a number of first-time actors.     A still from Yasmine. Photograph: Lek Kiatsirikajorn/MoST Artists    &quot;Everyone is going through a learning process,&quot; says Siti Kamaluddin from her director&apos;s chair on set, where she is filming a silat scene in a university auditorium near Brunei&apos;s capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. &quot;Working with inexperienced crew is challenging, and it&apos;s my first time directing a feature film, so all of us are going through this,&quot; she adds. &quot;It&apos;s been a wonderful journey, but I&apos;m not going to kid anybody by saying it&apos;s easy.&quot; Although Brunei boasts the second-highest standard of living in south-east Asia (just behind Singapore, according to UN data) and its population is among the richest in the world \u2013 thanks to vast oil and gas reserves \u2013 its culture remains, for the most part, deeply traditional. The last film ever made here was a 1960s how-to guide by the ministry of religious affairs about being a good citizen. Half a century later, not much has changed. The nation&apos;s only TV broadcaster, Radio Television Brunei (RTB), still airs government campaigns and quiz shows among its educational, religious and drama programmes, and there exists an apparent chasm between those who want to protect Brunei&apos;s family-oriented culture from outside influence \u2013 some ministers even fear Brunei could be &quot;diluted&quot; through tourism \u2013 with others, like Siti and her producer brother Khairuddin, seeking to promote it instead. &quot;We are creative people,&quot; explains Khairuddin during a break on set. &quot;We&apos;re full of poets and writers and I want to showcase Brunei in ways that haven&apos;t been done before.&quot; The siblings \u2013 who together run Brunei&apos;s first film company, Origin Films, and its sister company Origin Artistic Management \u2013 have spent the past four years working on Yasmine and have drafted in expertise from all over the region due to Brunei&apos;s lack of local technical and creative know-how. Silat stunts are choreographed and directed by one of Jackie Chan&apos;s right-hand men \u2013 Hong Kong stunt veteran Chan Man Ching \u2013 with other crew and actors hailing from Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. But the film&apos;s protagonist, Liyana Yus, is a 20-year-old Bruneian and novice actor who has spent the past year &quot;getting into character&quot; in a very Hollywood-like way. After dropping out of school, she has gone only by the name Yasmine and spends five hours a day with Chan Man Ching working out and practising silat. &quot;All of my friends have been asking me, &apos;How did you get the part?&apos;&quot; she laughs shyly. &quot;Being an actress never crossed my mind, but I thought I&apos;d go for the audition and I got the part.&quot; The Kamaluddins hope that Yasmine \u2013 aimed for distribution in south-east Asia next year \u2013 will help show the &quot;real&quot; Brunei to outsiders, who largely know this former British protectorate as a tax-free haven that often tops &quot;most boring tourist destination&quot; lists. In many ways, the most exciting news since Brunei won its independence in 1984, was when the sultan&apos;s playboy brother Prince Jefri Bolkiah was accused in the 1990s of embezzling $14.8bn as finance minister and running a 40-strong harem stocked with international beauties. (Investigators also discovered the prince owned, among an extensive art and property portfolio, over 2,000 cars, eight planes and a yacht named Tits).     On the set of Yasmine, makeup artists work on one of the actors. Photograph: Lek Kiatsirikajorn/MoST Artists    Industry experts have pointed to Brunei&apos;s nascent film scene as a potentially lucrative source of income \u2013 its jungles and mangroves providing a unique backdrop for action and wilderness films \u2013 and the Bruneian government has backed Yasmine with some $120,000, telling the Guardian that it hoped the film would &quot;inspire and encourage more locals to follow [the Kamaluddins&apos;] footsteps&quot;. But Siti \u2013 who insisted that every actor use the Bruneian dialect of Malay for authenticity \u2013 hopes for a wider and more encompassing outcome: a regional understanding of her little-understood and oft-maligned nation. &quot;You see a typical Hollywood high school movie \u2013 it&apos;s all about their lives,&quot; she explains. &quot;When Yasmine goes to school, she&apos;s wearing a tudong (hijab). She has her boy problems, she fights with her parents, her grandmother eats ambuyat (a local delicacy) and lives in the water village and uses a water taxi [to get around]. I make it look really normal. Not like in a documentary-style film, but in an everyday setting. I just want to show that, yes, this is part of our culture, but actually, everybody is the same.&quot; The art of silat  Practised all across south-east Asia, silat in Brunei uses six core attack techniques and varies from fighting with bare hands to using sticks, swords or daggers. Once hugely popular, it has since been replaced by other sports such as football, karate and hapkido, though it is historically said to have helped Brunei defend its kingdom from intruders. Champions are pressing for silat to be included in the Olympic Games."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/20/australians-in-2013-happy-confident-but-not-as-friendly-as-we-used-to-be", "sentences": ["The 2013 survey revealed 40% or more of all new arrivals from Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, China and Hong Kong have experienced discrimination because of their colour, race or religion."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-20T13:08:41Z", "title": "Australians in 2013: happy, confident \u2013 but not as friendly as we used to be", "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics", "Race issues", "Religion"], "article": "The good news about Australians is so good. We are happy, confident and pleased with our lot. Old fears have died. Our trust in police, public education and hospitals is nearly total. The nation revealed in the latest Mapping of Social Cohesion by the Scanlon Foundation is, in so many ways, not the Australia of political rancour and shock jock outrage. No wonder the 2013 survey also reveals new depths plumbed in our distrust of government and politicians. Professor Andrew Markus of Monash University has conducted these fine surveys since 2007. He watched the sharp rise in affection for Canberra that came with Kevin Rudd and watched it collapse with him in 2010. He says: \u201cWe have never got back our equilibrium.\u201d This year he finds nearly 90% of us trust hospitals and trust police. Nearly 85% of us trust public schools. Three-quarters of us even trust employers. But little more than a quarter of Australians trust Canberra to do the right thing by them most of the time. This was the bruising verdict of the country in the last weeks of the Gillard government. Though Markus is not claiming for a moment that Australia is about to fall to pieces, he finds the social cohesion of the country at a lower ebb than when these surveys began in 2007. Australia\u2019s subtle engagement with race is key to his work. Though White Australia came crashing down in the 1970s, Markus has identified a sizeable constituency still troubled by the race and religion of new arrivals. \u201cThere is a core of 10% and a wider group around 25 to 30% with strong negative views towards cultural diversity,\u201d he says. In 2013 their numbers are rising. This year, 28% of us disagreed with the proposition that \u201caccepting migrants from many different countries makes Australia stronger\u201d; and 25% admitted to having \u201cnegative feelings\u201d to migrants from the Middle East and Lebanon in particular. Markus takes this to be code for Muslim. Intolerant Australia appears to be becoming more intolerant. Markus reports a sharp rise in discrimination. The 2013 survey revealed 40% or more of all new arrivals from Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, China and Hong Kong have experienced discrimination because of their colour, race or religion. Markus is loth to tie this deteriorating situation directly to the politics of the boats. He found our attitudes to asylum seekers have further hardened in the past year: 33% of us now want all refugee boats turned back and only 18% support our treaty obligations to give refugees arriving by boat permanent residence in this country. Among Liberal/National voters, support for that is in single figures. Among Liberal/National voters who are getting on, not so well educated, living outside capital cities and struggling to pay their bills, support for having boat people live here hovers a little above zero. While Markus doubts the relentless politics of the boats is driving a change in general attitudes, he believes a big shift is nevertheless under way. Australia is one of the few countries where large-scale immigration is still popular; we are open to the world; but we aren\u2019t as friendly any more. \u201cDepartment of Immigration surveys around 2000 were asking migrants what they most liked about Australia and the number one factor was \u2018Australians being kind and friendly people\u2019. Now that\u2019s at the bottom of the list. And it\u2019s the same result if you\u2019re asking Indians, or Sri Lankans or New Zealanders. It\u2019s coming in at number zero.\u201d Yet despite discrimination, despite the cooling of our welcome, nearly 80% of migrants who have come to live here since 2000 are satisfied with life in Australia. Half those arriving from China and Hong Kong in those years and 75% from Indian and Sri Lanka already identify themselves as Australians. The welcome surprise for Markus in the 2013 survey was the national endorsement of multiculturalism. Whatever it means it has nearly everyone\u2019s approval. This year 84% of us said it has been good for Australia; 75% think it benefits economic development; and 70% think it encourages migrants to become part of Australian society. It is not an inner-city, high-education thing. \u201cIt\u2019s right across the community,\u201d says Markus. \u201cYou go to somewhere like the Atherton tableland which for some years returned a One Nation member of parliament and even there the brand of multiculturalism \u2013 whatever it means \u2013 is positive.\u201d For the first time in a long time a federal election was fought without any serious attacks on multiculturalism and the multicultural industry. \u201cWhat we have now,\u201d says Markus, \u201cis no concern at any significant level about immigration from Asia and across-the-board endorsement of the brand of multiculturalism.\u201d For Markus, this country\u2019s attitudes can always shift and change. They are not set in stone. He even thinks the collapse of trust in Canberra is not irreversible. \u201cThis government could turn that around,\u201d he says, \u201cif they were minded to do it.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/21/malawi-african-netball-future-south-africa", "sentences": ["In the last few seasons, netballers from Namibia and Botswana have been playing semi-professional netball in England and Singapore.", "For instance, Tanzania dominated the Netball Nations Cup in Singapore last year and would be in the top 10 if it weren\u2019t for lack of match-play."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-20T23:14:18Z", "title": "Malawi Queens hint at netball\u2019s African future", "tags": ["Netball", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "Some may have been asking about the wisdom of bringing over Malawi after they lost to Australia by 49 goals in front of a half-empty stadium in Wollongong on Wednesday night. Saturday\u2019s Test on the Gold Coast was a totally different story \u2013 the Malawi Queens were level with Australia for nearly 25 minutes and only really fell away in the last quarter, finally losing 37-64. The scoreline only told half the story; Malawi produced an entertaining mix of acrobatic splits, funky flick-shots, deceptive one-hand passing, slippery cross-court plays and headbanded athletes brimming with charisma. Let\u2019s also not forget Malawi is one of the poorest countries in in the world and yet boast the world\u2019s fifth-best netball team. The Queens are officially the most successful sporting team the nation has ever produced. Malawi missing three top players Netball in big news in Malawi, where the word for netball\u00a0is nchembre mbaye \u2013 &quot;nchembre&quot; means &quot;mother&quot;. But there was nothing motherly about the way the Netball Association of Malawi (NAM) stopped four of its players from touring with this side; shooter Sindi \u2018Sniper\u2019 Simutowe, Beatrice Kadango, Lauren Ngwira and Grace Mhango. All four play for a club called the Tigresses. During a national league match in Malawi, Ngwira was suspended just prior to a Tigresses match after allegedly being found to be pregnant. The team was told they would forfeit the match, but NAM alleges the team refused to the leave the court. The Nyasa Times also published unconfirmed reports that \u201cTigresses players were then involved in a scuffle with some NAM officials up to an extent for the police intervention\u201d. A few weeks later, NAM responded by refusing to let those players trial for the Australia/New Zealand/Fiji tour.\u00a0 In any event, Simutowe, Ngwira and Mhango are big losses for the team. Simutowe is a wonderful goal attack who plays like Mary Waya crossed with Simone Forbes \u2013 both a playmaker and an accurate long-range shooter. The biggest hole was left in Malawi&apos;s defence though. Mhango and Ngwira both normally share the goalkeeper bib in the Queens\u2019 starting line-up. Ngwira stands at just over 180cm \u2013 the tallest defender available in the Malawi squad. With a bit of extra height at the back, who knows just how much better Malawi could have been in these Tests. Mwawi Kumwenda had pleaded with NAM officials to allow the three to tour, Ngwira denies being pregnant, Malawi\u2019s sports minister told BNL Times the matter was handed childishly and all four players were later cleared of any misconduct in an investigation by the Malawi National Sports Council. Malawi\u2019s 84-35 goal loss on Wednesday was the Queens&apos; biggest ever loss to the Diamonds \u2013 need we say more?\u00a0 How Africa can save international netball Beyond the top four sides world netball has traditionally been seriously lacking in depth. The rise of Africa is huge news for world netball, I can see another two or three African nations competing with the best in the next years and at least another half-a-dozen filling out the middle rung of world netball rankings. \u00a0 GDP in Africa is steadily increasing, creating a new educated middle class and opportunities for women to make a living from netball. Kumwenda will be suiting out for the Canterbury Tactix in the ANZ Championship next year becoming the first African import in the history of the league. In the last few seasons, netballers from Namibia and Botswana have been playing semi-professional netball in England and Singapore. East Africa is particularly fertile for creating world-class teams, with the fast-growing nations of Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya (along with Malawi) now producing dozens of tall, lean, crafty and supremely athletic netball players. Unfortunately, as the Malawi situation showed, the hopes of African netball could be dashed by dodgy administrators. For instance, Tanzania dominated the Netball Nations Cup in Singapore last year and would be in the top 10 if it weren\u2019t for lack of match-play. But under new management the \u2018Tafia Queens\u2019 have not played a single match since winning the event, possibly costing them a place in the Commonwealth Games.  Along with poor administration, lack of money and corporate sponsorship are the other big factors holding African netball back. The Uganda She-Cranes would be ranked in the top eight in the world, but are currently unranked because they have not played enough matches. While the UK Netball Development Trust continues to run extensive skills workshops in Ugandan schools, the She-Cranes have not played a netball match outside of Africa since 1979. In June, Uganda had to travel close to 2,000 km in a hot, old minibus on makeshift mud roads to play in the African Netball Championship because the side couldn\u2019t raise enough money for flights. Nonetheless, the She-Cranes terrorised their opposition, eventually finishing third \u2013 losing only to Malawi and South Africa.\u00a0 Winning against adversity is becoming a theme in African netball: Zimbabwe, despite basic playing conditions, has a new multi-tiered netball super-league which is producing some excellent players. The Zambian team is showing vast improvement with the nation having just set up a youth league with funding from UK Sport. Further afield, and Botswana has recently won the rights to host the 2017 World Youth Netball Championships.\u00a0 \u00a0South Africa professional netball goal hindered by lack of money Lack of corporate interest is holding back the development of professional netball in South Africa. Netball South Africa is desperately trying to start a 10-team professional league and while there has already been commitment to televise all the matches from its broadcast partner, it is struggling to find businesses who want to put money on the table. It was originally hoped the league would be in operational with full-time paid netballers by April this year, with each team having an import from other African nations. Proteas coach Elize Kotze told the Guardian \u201cthis is still a dream on paper with the hope kicking-off in April 2014\u201d. But sponsorship remains incredibly slow.  Since Irene Van Dyk migrated to New Zealand, South Africa has failed to make even the semi-finals of a major world event.\u00a0 \u201cThe difference between the Spar Proteas and the top-three England, New Zealand and Australia is definitely not the potential\u00a0but the opportunities available to train and play professional in well-established structures,\u201d Kotze told the Guardian. Indeed, with an estimated two million netball players, the sky is the limit for the current world No6. So will South Africa\u2019s netballers prevail or spend another few decades struggling to get the recognition, success and support they deserve?\u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/21/football-transfer-rumours-manchester-united", "sentences": ["Yes, the lovable former Blackburn Rovers manager \u2013 a man certain to draw a crowd wherever he goes \u2013 is apparently taking over at Brunei DPMM, who last year finished runners-up in Singapore&apos;s S.League but this year are stuck firmly in the bottom half."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-21T08:46:27Z", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Luke Shaw to Manchester United? | Georgina Turner", "tags": ["Transfer window", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "It is quickly getting harder to find devilish amusement in the travails of David Moyes, already there is something about the hue of those eyes that says &quot;You&apos;ll only end up hating yourself&quot;.

Thanks to an amazingly cushy 35-year deal agreed with the government, the plant to be known as Hinkley C is the responsibility of a consortium largely split between the French energy giant EDF and two Chinese setups, the China General Nuclear Power Group and the China National Nuclear Corporation. EDF is 85% owned by the French government; the Chinese state owns all of the latter two companies. Nationalisation, it seems, is back \u2013 only it&apos;s a new kind, whereby it is overseas governments who get to buy up our national assets. Just look at the evidence. At the last official count, a third of British infrastructure was overseas-owned \u2013 but what&apos;s particularly interesting is the amount of government money involved. EDF \u2013 it stands for \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France \u2013 already owns two British coal-fired power stations, eight UK nuclear plants and a couple of British wind farms. Germany&apos;s Deutsche Bahn is a 100% state-owned railway company, and since 2010, it has also owned Arriva, which controls an array of British bus services as well as the majority of trains that run in Wales, and a whole load that serve Birmingham (prior to buying Arriva, DB had already bought the Chiltern main line, overground services in London and Tyne and Wear Metro). DP World owns 60 or so ports across the planet, including the Port of London and the Port of Southampton \u2013 and is controlled by Dubai World, an investment company that acts on behalf of Dubai&apos;s government. The state-backed China Investment Corporation owns nearly 10% of Thames Water and a similar-sized chunk of Ferrovial, the Spanish-owned conglomerate that has a big stake in the airports at Heathrow, Southampton, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Those airports are also 20% owned by Qatar Holding, which slings money around on behalf of Qatar&apos;s rulers. Oh, and just to bring things up to date, among the big investors that bought thousands of shares in Royal Mail were sovereign wealth funds whose money comes from the governments of Kuwait and Singapore. The Hinkley Point deal is traceable to a memorandum of understanding on infrastructure investment, agreed by the governments of China and the UK in 2011, and boosted by George Osborne&apos;s recent trip to Beijing (where he announced that another state-owned Chinese company is to get involved in Manchester airport). There will, it seems, be much more of this stuff \u2013 not least, perhaps, when it comes to the new high-speed rail line that will run between London and Birmingham and beyond. Among the firms who are interested in a piece of that particular action are the state-owned China Railway Group, though while in China, Osborne said talks about all that were &quot;for another day&quot;. Strange, perhaps, that the same Tories who warn of the perils of government intervention in the economy and our supposed loss of sovereignty to the wicked old EU should be going down this road, but there we are: state ownership is obviously fine, so long as it&apos;s someone else&apos;s state that&apos;s doing it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2013/oct/22/london-house-prices-foreign-investors", "sentences": ["&quot;This is not the jet-set but rather the working middle classes expanding into the world, often for the first time,&quot; said a Knight Frank representative recently of purchasers from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-22T09:11:00Z", "title": "London housing crisis: how far are super-rich foreigners to blame?", "tags": ["Politics", "London politics", "London", "Society", "Housing", "House prices", "Boris Johnson"], "article": "Something isn&apos;t right about the London house price narrative that&apos;s enjoyed such favour in these parts lately. It began with a New York Times article two weeks ago in which an ex-pat Londoner mourned the departure of two neighbouring households for other parts of the UK, in each case blaming the capital&apos;s insane property price. This was described as part of a trend. But my first reaction was: &quot;what&apos;s new?&quot; London&apos;s population is rising fast - driven primarily by birthrate - yet for years it&apos;s been the case that large numbers of people have moved out of the capital and into home ownership in other parts of the country. A 2010 GLA report found that between 2001 and 2009 no less than 2.1 million departed for different locations in these islands, with most moving into owner-occupation - London property was too expensive. The size of the outflow actually fell during 2007-09 as mortgages became harder to get. What seems to have happened in the past year or two is that a manic upward surge in prices has meant even more Londoners unable to buy a home in their own city, with those affected now including even the more affluent sections of London&apos;s middle-class - a description that seems to fit the NYT writer&apos;s outward-migrating friends - and, of course, their young grown-up children.  Setting aside jaundiced suspicions about precisely why London&apos;s many-faceted housing crisis, which has been deepening all century, is suddenly of such concern to a certain type of newspaper, let&apos;s examine the argument that super-rich foreign investors are to blame for the crisis embracing the capital&apos;s more prosperous residents. No one doubts that massive money flowing in from abroad in search of easy profits and safe havens is a significant part of the story. But who do we mean by &quot;foreign investors&quot; and how significant are they in the wider scheme of things?  Jaws drop at statistics showing that 75% of new homes in inner London and half of central London&apos;s \u00a31m-plus homes go to foreign buyers. Yet estate agent Knight Frank has calculated that nearly half the foreigners who&apos;ve purchased \u00a31m-plus properties in central London in the last year live in the UK, and bought to let rather than to leave. The potential problem there is not the foreignness of the investment or even the investment itself but the likely size of the rents.  Meanwhile, across the rest of inner and the whole of outer London, the vast majority of home-buyers in the past two years have been UK nationals. Also, overseas buyers of homes in London aren&apos;t all super-rich. &quot;This is not the jet-set but rather the working middle classes expanding into the world, often for the first time,&quot; said a Knight Frank representative recently of purchasers from Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong.  Londoners themselves are probably part of the reason prices continue to soar. One housing market expert suspects that what he calls &quot;this crazy boom&quot; is being further fuelled by a kind of panic-buying among people with savings, wealthy relatives or equity in existing homes who fear that the market is spiraling beyond their means forever. He predicts that this now-or-never part of the &quot;feeding frenzy&quot; will continue until everyone who can get their hands on the necessary cash has sunk it into their pile of bricks and mortar. All of this suggests we should be cautious about blaming the boom entirely on opportunist billionaires from far-off lands idly parking their fortunes in new apartment blocks and leaving these empty until a better offer comes along. The thesis that London property has become a casually-disposable form of cash or bonds for such people rightly excites outrage and is fine as far as it goes, but it doesn&apos;t explain everything and might be better seen as a particularly spectacular phase of a phenomenon that&apos;s been with us for some time. And the heart of the housing crisis lies elsewhere. Responding to the NYT piece, London historian Jerry White wrote &quot;it is a delusion to think that a few hundred, even a few thousand, fabulously wealthy individuals can affect the lives of 8.2 million people,&quot; and concluded that London&apos;s housing problem results &quot;not from pressure at the top but from a shameful lack of affordable public housing for the millions of people who make this city tick.&quot; This lack, and the wider shortage of genuinely affordable homes in London whether to buy or to rent (including in the private sector), has been with us far too long under national governments of different stripes. The current market madness is part of what&apos;s wrong, and seems unlikely to self-correct while the supply of new market housing is tailored towards a demand other than that of those whose need for homes is greatest - another delusion, and one the Mayor of London shares.  But lack of political will and judgement are the larger culprits here. London must find ways to build homes that Londoners and potential Londoners across the income spectrum can afford to live in - and must do so for its own good."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/22/brunei-sharia-law-islamic-flogging-stoning", "sentences": ["Caning is also used as punishment in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-22T14:38:02Z", "title": "Brunei to bring in tough new sharia law", "tags": ["Brunei", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Islam", "Religion", "Law"], "article": "Brunei plans to implement a tough new sharia criminal code next year that could see citizens stoned for adultery or having a limb amputated for theft. Those convicted of drinking alcohol or committing other violations \u2013 such as abortion \u2013 could be flogged. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah \u2013 who is thought to be worth about $20bn (\u00a312.3bn) and exercises tight control over the Muslim-majority country \u2013 described the legislation as &quot;part of the great history of our nation&quot; and a form of &quot;special guidance&quot; from God. &quot;It is because of our need that Allah the Almighty, in all his generosity, has created laws for us, so that we can utilise them to obtain justice,&quot; the 67-year-old was quoted as saying in local media. The oil-rich sultanate already forbids the sale of alcohol and bans the evangelism of religions other than Islam. It is known for practising a more conservative form of Islam than its majority-Muslim neighbour Malaysia. While sharia law already exists within the small south-east Asian nation \u2013 which is home to roughly 406,000 people, two-thirds of whom are Muslim \u2013 the Islamic court has, to date, primarily handled family-related affairs like marriage and inheritance. The new penal code will be enforced in phases, local media reported, and will apply only to Muslims. However, visitors to the Brunei could be flogged under existing secular laws for crimes including immigration offences. Caning is also used as punishment in Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore. Brunei \u2013 which also calls itself the &quot;abode of peace&quot; \u2013 has seen an increase in crime in recent years, with courts dealing with petty robberies, drug trafficking, fraud and prostitution. Some in the country seem to welcome the new legislation, with commentators taking to social media to write &quot;long live the sultan&quot; and &quot;praise be to Allah&quot;. But human rights activists denounced the move as &quot;feudal&quot; and &quot;abhorrent&quot; and said the praise may be out of fear of the government. &quot;If Brunei were a functioning democracy instead of an authoritarian, absolute monarchy, you&apos;d probably see some negative reaction to this,&quot; said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. &quot;But people recognise that if they stick their heads up, they&apos;ll have to face the sultan&apos;s men \u2026 because rocking the boat means you could end up in a judicial system that is far from fair.&quot; Brunei&apos;s leading Islamic scholar described the sharia code as &quot;guarantee[d] justice for everyone&quot;. Mufti Awang Abdul Aziz told a legal conference on Tuesday: &quot;Let us not just look at the hand-cutting or the stoning or the caning per se. It is not indiscriminate cutting or stoning or caning. There are conditions and there are methods that are just and fair.&quot; He said that tourists should not fear the new legislation as long as they were law-abiding. &quot;Do all potential tourists to Brunei plan to steal? If they do not, then what do they need to fear? Believe me when I say that with our sharia criminal law, everyone \u2013 including tourists \u2013 will receive proper protection,&quot; he said. The sultan \u2013 who has reigned since 1967 and lives in an 1,800-room palace \u2013 also implied that those outside Brunei would do better not to judge the adoption of the new code. &quot;We view others \u2026 without any form of prejudice,&quot; he said. &quot;In return, we also have the right to expect that others will view Brunei in the same light.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/22/the-fiver-alex-ferguson-book", "sentences": ["&quot;For me it is important that 30,000 people in the stadium did not see it and I was one of them.&quot; Former Blackeye Rovers boss Steve Kean-out is set to take over at Brunei DPMM in the Singapore S.League next season."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-22T15:26:36Z", "title": "The Fiver | The sort of glossing-over only usually seen in Dulux adverts", "tags": ["Sir Alex Ferguson", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "THE LORD GIVETH \u2026 Few books over the years have had their own press conference to mark the launch. Tolstoy, Chaucer, Dickens, Flaubert \u2013 none got the opportunity to explain their work. Which is something of a shame. Imagine the fuss that could have been avoided if the authors behind the world&apos;s great religious texts had had the chance to tell the press that it was all in fact a biting satire on the pervasive dangers of cultism, or that they were planning a sequel in which a machine-gun toting Beelzebub is the head of a South American drugs cartel and one of the apostles is just two days from retirement. Today, though, Lord Ferg, a man who over the years has made a habit of boycotting certain media outlets and banning others, welcomed the world&apos;s press to a room in central London to talk about his magnificent octopus \u2013 My Autobiography (the much-awaited sequel to Ferguson&apos;s 1999 book entitled, um, (Managing My Life) My Autobiography). It was all covered: Roy Keane, David Beckham, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Roberto Mancini, David Moyes. And because the embargo on the contents of the book ended at 2pm this afternoon, the internet has been awash with the choicest nuggets: the fallouts, the tantrums, the rivalries, the friendships. All of which seems to be somewhat self-defeating. The Fiver had been looking forward to nuzzling down under the duvet with My Autobiography and a half a dozen Purple Tin, but today&apos;s hoopla means that throughout the afternoon the world&apos;s sporting media has been doing the literary equivalent of standing outside a cinema and shouting &quot;He&apos;s his father! It&apos;s a sled! He&apos;s a ghost! The boat sinks! It&apos;s really earth! His mother&apos;s a skeleton! She&apos;s really a man! He&apos;s really a woman! Dumbledore dies! Dumbledore dies! DUMBLEDORE DIES!&quot; at anyone walking in. And, given the breadth of the topics covered, it&apos;s a shame the book, like the nation&apos;s high streets, contains more than the odd gap. There&apos;s little or nothing on why he did not recommend Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as his successor, little or nothing on Wayne Rooney&apos;s desire to leave the club last summer, just one page on his seven-year boycott of the Beeb, and, most glaring of all, the Old-Trafford-foundation-shaking Rock of Gibraltar affair gets the sort of glossing-over only usually seen in Dulux adverts. So, ironically, all the hype means you probably don&apos;t have to part with your hard-earned and actually buy the thing. But the day&apos;s Ferg-related intrigue isn&apos;t over yet. Keane comes in for the most searing criticism (&quot;The hardest part of Roy&apos;s body is his tongue,&quot; which is rather a disturbing image and must make chewing quite difficult) and the former United midfielder will be sitting on the ITV sofa for Arsenal&apos;s Big Cup tie against Borussia Dortmund this evening. Given that his standard pundit demeanour is that of a short-tempered bear who has just been handed a large tax bill and told his end of the woods is about to be demolished to make way for a bypass \u2013 all the while sat in a small room next to Adrian Chiles for longer than is humanly reasonable \u2013 his reaction when the aforementioned presenter opens the programme with &quot;So, Roy \u2026&quot; could well make better viewing than anything \u00d6zil, Reus and co can muster.

SVX, short for Social Venture Connexion, was launched in Canada in September. SVX, led by the MaRS Centre for Impact Investing in Toronto, describes itself as a private investment platform built to connect impact ventures, funds and investors in order to catalyse new debt and equity investment capital. The aim of the platform is to enable impact ventures and funds based in the state of Ontario to raise investments of $100,000\u2013$10m (\u00a360,000 - \u00a36m) from accredited impact investors. Investors will include: &quot;foundations and endowments (private, public or community), financial institutions, asset managers, wealth advisors and high-net-worth individuals that meet the definitional requirements of an accredited investor as per securities regulations.&quot; &apos;SVX, Invest for Impact&apos;, a paper by Adam Spence and Tristina Sinopoli from the MaRS Centre, explains that the platform was first proposed in 2007. Initial backers include the government of Ontario, who endorsed the idea as part of their poverty reduction strategy, supported a feasibility study and pilot project, with other supports including TMX Group, owners of the Toronto Stock Exchange. During the development of the project, it became clear that there were a growing number of charities, non-profits, co-ops and for-profit companies building business models to tackle the collective problems faced by society, wrote Spence and Sinopoli. They also found that local social ventures had tens of millions of dollars in capital demand. Their major problem was access to capital. At the same time, there were major practical barriers to investors making investments. Investors &quot;lacked the expertise and resources required to identify social ventures and make appropriate investments&quot;, according to the report. SVX aims to solve that problem from both sides by providing social ventures with a low-cost method of gaining access to investors. While Spence admits to feeling a bit of discomfort describing their work as &quot;a global first&quot;, he is keen to explain the differences between SVX and other similarly named initiatives elsewhere in the world. For Spence, the key difference is, while they promote social investment, neither the UK&apos;s Social Stock Exchange nor the Singapore-based Asia Impact Investment Exchange are stock exchanges: &quot;Despite their names, none of these platforms are markets or exchanges ... They are primarily focused on impact assessment, and they do not engage in capital markets activities like the SVX.&quot; Describing the work of the UK&apos;s Social Stock Exchange, Spence explains that rather than directly connecting social ventures with investors they are an information website that focuses on assessing the social impact of these currently listed companies. SVX, on the other hand, is more like a social stock exchange. &quot;SVX is registered as a restricted dealer with the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), not unlike any other capital markets players like financial advisors, financial institutions, broker-dealers, and exchanges or marketplaces,&quot; Spence explained. &quot;This is not to say that the work of the SVX is better than what is going on in London or Singapore, as they are doing great work. But they are all different.&quot; In its pilot phase, SVX hopes to attract at least $2.5m (\u00a31.49m) in new capital for investment into 10 social ventures and ultimately hopes to expand the model across Canada and beyond. Bonnie Foley-Wong, of Pique Ventures, a network of investors committed to changing the face of investing, who has worked in both the UK and Canada, welcomes the launch of SVX but says that Canada, like the UK, still has a long way to go in tackling &apos;structural barriers&apos; that provide people, with smaller amounts to invest, becoming social investors. She explains: &quot;There isn&apos;t a lot of training around making purpose investments in ventures. Instead we have all this legislation that is meant to protect people rather than give them the tools and the information they need to make a good investment decision.&quot; David Floyd is managing director of Social Spider CIC.

On BBC Radio 4, he made his mark in 1987 by succeeding John Ebdon as presenter of the Archive programme and going on to present the nostalgic Times Remembered. However, his most striking work was done in Wales. The village where he lived on the island of Anglesey gave its name to his spoof pirate station, Radio Brynsiencyn, parodying the commercial broadcasters of the time. Recorded in the kitchen of his cottage and given a final polish by BBC Radio Wales, the programme created the illusion of coming from an independent outfit and gained an international following during the 1980s. The former BBC foreign correspondent Angus McDermid was Skidmore&apos;s &quot;foreign editor&quot;: they had first met while working on the local paper in Bangor, Gwynedd, on the other side of the Menai Strait, and McDermid delighted in telling of the Bangors he had visited in other countries. The Skidmores&apos; cleaner, Rose Roberts, appeared as Attila the Hoover; there was a vocal quartet, the Oscars, first heard at a lifeboat charity event; and the breaking of his own celebrated treble voice left the teenage Aled Jones keen to gain experience as an interviewer. Skidmore&apos;s books came at the rate of around one a year for much of his career, ranging from comic novels to several on the history of north Wales. His autobiography, Forgive Us Our Press Passes (1983), was read on Radio 4 and the World Service. The actor Ian Carmichael described it as a &quot;comic masterpiece&quot; and nursed hopes of a TV series in which he could play Skidmore. A new version, more than twice the original length, was published in 2008. Born and brought up in Manchester, Ian was the son of Irene and her policeman husband, Edward. He left Didsbury Central school at the age of 12 when his mother took him to Derbyshire to avoid the second world war bombing raids, although he always maintained he quit because he feared the teachers would interfere with his education. His love of reading saw him spend countless hours in public libraries: he described his qualifications as &quot;a sort of MA (Penguin)&quot;. His father responded to his journalistic aspirations by getting him a job as an apprentice printer on the Evening Chronicle (later merged into the Manchester Evening News). At the age of 18 he was called up for national service, undertaken with a total lack of distinction in the Black Watch, his stint including 56 days in a military prison. Upon his release, he dodged a vengeful sergeant major by diving through the first available door: that of the army public relations unit. Mere mention of the Chronicle had the staff there assuming that he was a reporter, and so he was posted to Berlin as a sergeant with the 7th Armoured Division. He was assigned to covering the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49, and within a year had made his first British Forces Radio broadcast. After leaving the army, he joined the Manchester City News, another title of the past, progressing to the Yorkshire Evening Post, the Daily Dispatch in Liverpool and the Daily Mirror in Manchester. Despite his lack of formal education, no shorthand skills and a poor grasp of spelling and punctuation, he became one of the youngest night news editors on a national paper, with spells at the News of the World, Daily Mirror, Sunday Pictorial, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People. Then he worked as a freelance based in Chester, where in 1966 he covered the Moors murders trial of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. He married a fellow journalist, Celia Lucas, his second wife, in 1971, and they moved to Anglesey. Two years later, a chance meeting with Lord Langford led to the first of his more than 30 books. Escape from the Rising Sun: The Incredible Voyage of the Sederhana Djohanis tells the story of the then Geoffrey Alexander Rowley-Conwy&apos;s escape from the Japanese invasion of Singapore and his eventful journey to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Skidmore&apos;s newspaper columns and reviews led to broadcasting opportunities. In 1978 he joined the newly launched BBC Radio Wales, where for 15 years he hosted the interview series In Conversation, as well as making entertaining contributions to the quiz chaired by Vincent Kane. Skidmore&apos;s 15 television series were made for BBC Wales, HTV and Granada, and he was a popular guest on chat shows. Underneath a cantankerous facade, he was a thoughtful, sensitive interviewer who had the rare ability to turn an argument into a pleasure. He had no strong political allegiances, but no party or institution escaped his wrath. If asked where his political loyalties lay, he would typically reply, &quot;I&apos;m non-political, that&apos;s why I vote Plaid Cymru,&quot; although in reality he had no time for Welsh nationalism or Welsh-language fanatics. In 1998, after more than 1,000 programmes, he was awarded a Golden Microphone for services to broadcasting, but a fortnight later was controversially dropped by BBC Radio Wales.

Bo, the 64-year-old former Communist party head of the south-western metropolis of Chongqing, was once known for his charisma, elaborate anti-crime campaigns and neo-Maoist politics. He fell from grace last year after his second-in-command fled to the US consulate in a neighbouring city, exposing his wife&apos;s murder of a British businessman in a Chongqing hotel. Last month, the Jinan intermediate people&apos;s court in the coastal Shandong province sentenced Bo to life in prison for accepting \u00a32.1m in bribes, embezzling more than \u00a3500,000 and abusing his position by blocking an investigation into the murder. After a brief session on Friday, the Shandong high people&apos;s court upheld the lower court&apos;s decision, China&apos;s state newswire Xinhua reported via its official microblog. It did not provide further details. Bo will not have another chance to appeal. He mounted a feisty defense at his trial, turning what many had expected to be a brief, staid affair into a five-day drama full of cutting dialogue and lurid revelations. He denied all of the charges. Analysts said that while the Chinese government was keen to present the trial as evidence of the country&apos;s rule of law, authorities tightly controlled the proceedings and determined his verdict well in advance. Bo&apos;s former second-in-command, Wang Lijun, is serving a 15-year prison sentence after being found guilty of a series of charges, including defection. His wife, Gu Kailai, was found guilty of murder last year and received a suspended death sentence \u2013 effectively life in prison. Bo&apos;s sentence was the harshest for a current or former member of China&apos;s politburo, the country&apos;s top decision-making body, since 1981, when Mao&apos;s widow Jiang Qing received a suspended death sentence for overseeing atrocities during the Cultural Revolution. Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, called the rejected appeal unsurprising. &quot;Politically I think [Bo] is finished,&quot; he said. &quot;But Chinese politics are not predictable.

But if they do, there&apos;s even less chance of them missing it. Down a no-through-road in south Croydon punctuated by well-kept lawns, tidy flowerbeds and clipped hedges, there&apos;s a\u00a0small plot packed with plants that even the keenest gardener would struggle to recognise. Strictly speaking, it&apos;s not Wong&apos;s garden, it&apos;s\u00a0his mum&apos;s, but she&apos;s happy to let him do as he likes with it because, &quot;It\u00a0saves her the bother of mowing the grass.&quot; Wong lives in\u00a0central London \u2013 &quot;to be near the pretentious wine bars&quot; \u2013 and comes down to Croydon twice a week to sow, weed and prune his plants. And\u00a0to eat them: finding new plants to eat is his passion. Wong, a botanist by training, made a name for himself as the presenter of Grow Your Own Drugs, a TV programme about herbal remedies, and has since appeared on Gardeners&apos; World and Countryfile, as well as becoming the Gardeners&apos; Question Time expert on exotics. His philosophy is easily summed up: &quot;Why bother to grow something everyone else is growing when there are so many other untried varieties?&quot; He was brought up in Singapore and Malaysia, and initially experimented with ornamental tropical plants that few realised could be grown in colder climates, but his focus shifted after the Royal Horticultural Society invited him to\u00a0give a talk on growing\u00a0berries. &quot;I started preparing the night before,&quot; he laughs, &quot;and started panicking when I typed &apos;growing berries&apos; into Google and got 400,000 hits. What could I possibly tell an audience of keen berry growers that\u00a0they didn&apos;t already know? So\u00a0I\u00a0started thinking about why so much horticultural training is directed towards the culture of the same 20 edible plants, rather than the 3,000 and more that you can grow. Was there a reason this stuff wasn&apos;t being grown, other than force of habit? &quot;I lectured about the different berries that could theoretically be grown in this country, and expected the audience to collapse with boredom. Instead, I ended up with two and a half hours of questions, most of which I had no answers to, because there weren&apos;t any to be had\u00a0at that time.&quot;     Thai basil. Photograph: David Yeo    So began Wong&apos;s transformation of his mum&apos;s front garden into a\u00a0test lab. Every plant has to prove itself, with only the best deserving inclusion in his book on growing exotics, James Wong&apos;s Homegrown Revolution . Not\u00a0only must they be easy to grow (he doesn&apos;t have a greenhouse), but they must also produce a\u00a0decent crop. His Andean potatoes failed at this hurdle, as did his soya beans. &quot;I&apos;d need a whole field to get a\u00a0worthwhile crop.&quot; One berry that did pass muster is the raspberry hybrid &apos;Glencoe&apos;. &quot;It&apos;s got this amazing fluorescent purple colouring and tastes like a raspberry enhanced with E numbers. Best of all, it doesn&apos;t seem to feature on birds&apos; colour spectrum.&quot; It turns out that many unconventional plants are easier to grow than more familiar ones. &quot;Most pests recognise a\u00a0cabbage from a long way off,&quot; Wong says, &quot;but they don&apos;t have a\u00a0clue what a tomatillo is.&quot; Pests and me both.     Cucamelons. Photograph: David Yeo    &quot;They&apos;re a bit like a cross between a cape gooseberry and a tomato. They&apos;re used a lot in Mexican food and I&apos;ve only ever seen them in a\u00a0spice shop in west London for \u00a32 each. I can get a couple of kilos off each plant. Here, try one.&quot; I do. It&apos;s\u00a0rather good. Wong talks me through some of his other crops. The Sichuan pepper: &quot;Don&apos;t grow them for the seed pods; grow them for the early spring leaves that are like a Thai green curry paste.&quot; The cucamelon: &quot;Tastes like a\u00a0cucumber, but is far easier to grow and sells for \u00a312.99 a\u00a0punnet in posh delis.&quot; Asian pears: &quot;Crisper and more fragrant than European pears.&quot; Hardy kiwi fruit with no fur and twice the sweetness. Pineapple guava, asparagus peas, blood-red sweetcorn, Thai basil\u2026 it goes on.     Sweetcorn 'Ruby Queen'. Photograph: David Yeo    Is there anything he can&apos;t grow? Wong pauses. &quot;Chillies are tricky, because there&apos;s seldom enough sun to generate enough heat in the plant, but most plants are surprisingly hardy. The reason we don&apos;t grow or eat them is largely cultural. In Asia, hemerocallis [daylily] is grown as food; we grow it as ornamental flowers.&quot; The same goes for dahlias, an unexpected sight in Wong&apos;s garden. &quot;They were brought over here for their roots, which taste like Jerusalem artichokes, but we started to value them for their flowers and forgot about eating them.&quot; It sounds almost too good to be true: bumper crops of exotic fruit and veg that the well-off fooderati are paying vast sums for. But can Wong be sure his new varieties aren&apos;t going to poison anyone? &quot;That&apos;s not so hard as all that,&quot; he says. &quot;You can check the records of what people have eaten in different parts of the world over the centuries. And, failing that, it&apos;s easy to measure a plant&apos;s toxicity levels. Many plants are toxic if you eat too much of them. Taste is another matter, though. You just have to try it and find out.&quot; So what plants failed his own taste test? Wong doesn&apos;t pause. &quot;Coriander.

He had a matchless personal experience of the civilisation that became his life&apos;s work, and amassed the leading private collection of modern Chinese art outside the country. From his first visit to China in 1940 to his last in 2013, he forged and maintained friendships with generations of artists. This was not easy after the founding of the People&apos;s Republic in 1949, and it was not until 1973 that he was able to meet again friends with whom he had been unable even to correspond during the Cultural Revolution. In that period, Michael worked and travelled throughout south-east Asia and the Pacific, acquiring a rare pluralism in his perspective on Chinese art, and he remained outspoken in his support of artistic freedom. His tireless promotion of the understanding of China in the west, as a teacher, writer, traveller and collector, was honoured with the exhibition Michael Sullivan and Twentieth-Century Chinese Art at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2012. He was born in Toronto, the youngest of five children of Alan Sullivan, a Canadian mining engineer turned prolific novelist (under the pen name Sinclair Murray) and his indomitable wife Elisabeth (nee Hees). The family moved to Britain when Michael was three, and set about educating him as a model Englishman, with only partial success. At prep school (Fonthill, in East Grinstead) and public school (Rugby), he was caned for idleness; at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, he drifted through a degree in architecture (1936-39). He lacked direction, but not conviction. A declared pacifist, he heard in autumn 1939 that the Quakers were recruiting a small team to go to China to drive trucks for the International Red Cross. He left the following February, in his own words, &quot;long before the fighting started \u2026 and before the tribunals had been set up to test the sincerity of conscientious objectors&quot;. For two years, he drove medical supplies between cities in south-west China under bombardment from the Japanese. In 1942, he settled in Chengdu, working at the museum of the West China Union University. There, the Paris-trained painter Pang Xunqin introduced Michael to Chinese painting and also to many of the artists in Sichuan at that time. In 1943 he married Wu Baohuan, a bacteriologist, who became known as Khoan Sullivan. She devoted the rest of her life to his work. In 1946 Michael and Khoan returned to London and he began his formal study of the language, history and art of China at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas). Moving to Harvard in the US, he completed his PhD in 1952, and embarked on an academic career, first as lecturer in art history and curator of the art museum (which he founded) at the University of Malaya in Singapore. After a stint as lecturer in Asian art at Soas came the breakthrough: in 1966 he was appointed professor of oriental art at Stanford University in California. Khoan&apos;s outgoing nature, together with her Chinese nationality, opened possibilities for Michael that resulted in a groundbreaking book, Chinese Art in the Twentieth Century (1959). Based on conversations and correspondence with leading artists of the 1920s onwards, it was the first on the subject, in any language. Other books quickly followed. A Short History of Chinese Art (1967) went into its third edition as The Arts of China in 1973. The fifth edition is still in print, and, indefatigable, Michael had all but completed the sixth. No western scholar had a wider acquaintance than Michael among Chinese artists. His commitment to a sympathetic understanding of artists as individuals, rather than products of their environment, never wavered. Many of these artists gave him examples of their work. So began the Khoan and Michael Sullivan Collection of Modern Chinese Art \u2013 an accidental collection, as Michael liked to say, formed mostly of gifts and only latterly of purchases as well. The collection is broad and rich, including ink paintings by Zhang Daqian (several from the 1960s with dedicatory inscriptions to Khoan) and Qi Baishi, and woodblock-printed works by Huang Yongyu and Xu Bing. Michael remained at Stanford until 1984, when he returned to England as a fellow of St Catherine&apos;s College, Oxford. In 1990 he became an emeritus fellow, but retirement was foreign to him. He remained active, surrounded by his research assistants (the &quot;little animals&quot;, as he called them fondly), until the end. Khoan died in 2003. The Sullivan Collection is due to become part of the permanent collection of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. \u2022 Donovan Michael Sullivan, art historian, born 29 October 1916; died 28 September 2013"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/oct/25/ftse-100-five-month-high-federal-reserve", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund emerged with a 4.1% stake."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-25T16:32:00Z", "title": "FTSE 100 ends week at near five month high ahead of Fed meeting", "tags": ["Business", "Reckitt Benckiser", "Unilever", "RSA Insurance", "British Land", "Sports Direct International", "Asos", "Serco", "G4S", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Aberdeen Asset Management", "BHP Billiton", "Fresnillo", "ARM", "Apple", "Royal Mail", "Associated British Foods", "Sky plc", "Vodafone", "TalkTalk"], "article": "Leading shares hit a five month high this week on a host of positive economic news and growing hopes that the US Federal Reserve will keep the money taps switched on. The FTSE 100 finished at 6721.34 on Friday, up 8.16 points on the day and just shy of 100 points on the week, its best level since 28 May. At the start of the week came the US non-farm payroll figures, delayed because of the now-resolved government shutdown. They proved worse than expected, showing a 148,000 rise in jobs in September rather than the forecast 180,000 increase. But analysts said the data meant the Fed, whose next policy meeting starts on Tuesday, was unlikely to begin easing its $85bn a month bond buying programme this year. An early snapshot of Chinese manufacturing for October was better than expected, although some of the shine was taken off by concerns about a growing credit crunch in the county. On Friday came positive UK GDP figures showing a 0.8% rise in the third quarter, which added to the positive sentiment. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, said:  Risk appetite remained supported by the US fiscal resolution (albeit short term, be prepared for a re-run), a welcome rebound in China PMI manufacturing, continued recovery for UK GDP and - as strange as it sounds - the fallout from the government shutdown. Lost jobs, output and skewed data is likely to force the US Federal Reserve to delay plans to taper its QE3 stimulus programme until 2014 meaning continued easy monetary policy for longer.  Reckitt Benckiser was in focus as it announced a strategic review of its pharmaceuticals business, best known for its Suboxone heroin addiction treatment. Analysts suggested the review could lead to a sale of the division, which they calculated could be worth up to \u00a35.5bn. Reckitt rose as high as \u00a348.05 before slipping 25p on Friday to \u00a347.80, still nearly \u00a33 up on the week. Unilever confirmed its warning in September of a slowdown in emerging markets, reporting a 3.2% rise in third quarter sales, down from 5% in the previous three months. Its shares slipped 16p to \u00a324.93. Vague bid talk surrounded RSA Insurance, up 0.4p to 126.8p, as well as British Land, 5p better at 628p. A number of retail bosses decided to cash in after reporting strong sales growth. Sports Direct International founder Mike Ashley sold \u00a3106m worth of shares in the company at 662.5p each, while Asos chief executive Nick Robertson raised around \u00a380m and finance director Nicholas Beighton \u00a312m from disposing of share options. Robertson reportedly paid \u00a32.8m of his gains to Asos staff as bonuses. Sports Direct shares edged up 3p to 688p yesterday and Asos added 152p to \u00a352.57. Two outsourcing groups caught up in an investigation into some of their government contracts both announced executive changes. Serco said chief executive Chris Hyman was resigning, and its shares added 5p to 557.5p. G4S rose 5.5p to 258.5p as UK chief executive Richard Morris became the latest to leave. HSBC analysts raised their rating from underweight to neutral and their target price from 205p to 250p, saying:  Business fundamentals remain challenging in Europe and may precipitate a weak close to 2013. However, hopes that value can be unlocked through breakups and a rejuvenated strategy are likely to buoy G4S&apos; stock through what is perceived as a rump of difficult trading.  Banks had a volatile week, following concerns about a credit crunch in China and tougher than expected stress tests from the European Central Bank. But they recovered by the end of the week, with Royal Bank of Scotland 11.9p better at 368.4p on talk that Morgan Stanley had been appointed to lead a flotation of its US business Citizens. Lloyds Banking Group added 0.25p to 80.37p after confirmation it was in talks to sell its Scottish Widows Investment Partnership to Aberdeen Asset Management, up 8.7p to 459.1p, for up to \u00a3500m. Aberdeen plans to issue shares to Lloyds as part of the deal, giving the state owned bank a stake in the fund management group. Miners benefited from the positive manufacturing figures from China, a key consumer of commodities. BHP Billiton was 3p better at \u00a319.53p while precious metal specialist Fresnillo rose 15p to \u00a310.37 after it announced a $165m payout to shareholders on Thursday. As the US reporting season continued, Microsoft impressed with a better than expected 17% surge in third quarter profits, while Amazon also beat forecasts. Apple&apos;s week was dominated by two i&apos;s - the launch of its latest iPads and news that billionaire investor Carl Icahn called on the company to use its cash to buy back $150bn worth of shares. Apple shares slipped nearly 5% in early trading on Friday, ahead of results next week. Arm, the Cambridge-based chip designer which is one of Apple&apos;s key suppliers, failed to benefit from the iPad launch. Its shares recovered 22.5p to 983p but still ended 31p lower on the week as analysts fretted about a slowdown in royalty revenues, as revealed by the company&apos;s third quarter figures. Royal Mail shares hit a new closing high of 555p, up 26p as one of the earliest City brokers to suggest it was undervalued has upped its valuation. Panmure Gordon&apos;s Gert Zonneveld said a week before the flotation that the business could be worth \u00a33.7bn to \u00a34.5bn, compared to the sale price of \u00a33.3bn. Now Zonneveld has issued a note putting a 570p target on the business, valuing it at \u00a35.7bn. The news comes a day after it emerged JP Morgan told ministers before the sell-off that Royal Mail could be worth \u00a310bn, and in the same week hedge fund TCI became the company&apos;s second biggest shareholder behind the UK government. Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund emerged with a 4.1% stake. Associated British Foods, the sugar to Primark business, added 28p to \u00a321.33 as Morgan Stanley raised its price target from \u00a321.40 to \u00a322.65 with an overweight recommendation:  Negative market trends have heaped pressure on sugar. However, with most of the bad news now absorbed, we expect Primark to become the key driver of the ABF story. This should narrow the valuation gap with EU clothes retailers and help the stock to re-rate.  BSkyB was in demand for much of the week as it continued to shrug off challenges from rivals, but then suffered profit taking and fell 21.5p to 928.5p. City analysts continued to debate whether Vodafone, down 2.15p at 226.75p, could receive a bid from AT&amp;T once the deal to sell its stake in its US wireless joint venture to partner Verizon is complete. Credit Suisse was the latest, saying a bid of up to \u00a380bn would be needed to convince Vodafone to sell. The bank said:  We raise our price target to 245p [from 195p] per share to reflect increased forecasts and an assumed 50% probability of a bid from AT&amp;T. We calculate that Vodafone could increase its own value in a defence scenario by leveraging up more than the 0.7 times debt/EBITDA Vodafone is currently targeting. AT&amp;T would then have to bid up to \u00a380bn to overcome Vodafone&apos;s potential scepticism of the deal synergies and the impact of free cash flow/share dilution on the value of AT&amp;T shares received. However, we note that such a bid could put AT&amp;T&apos;s own dividend cover at risk \u2013 a possible red line for the company \u2013 particularly if its US mobile growth stalls next year. We also see little logic to AT&amp;T in such a footprint deal, with few if any synergies, no big change in EU spectrum regulation coming and leaving Vodafone exposed to the same 4play problem it has today. So despite the repeated comments by AT&amp;T (widely reported by Reuters and others in recent weeks) that it is interested in buying large European mobile assets, we place only a 50% probability of an AT&amp;T bid for the Vodafone stub happening. With downside to 210p if no bid, and a 50% probability of upside to 280p per share if AT&amp;T does bid, we raise our target price to the midpoint 245p, supported by our increased forecasts.  Finally TalkTalk Telecom fell 1.3p to 264.4p as analysts at Berenberg issued a sell note but pointed out a forgotten contract which could prove valuable to the company. The bank said:  Back in May 2012, TalkTalk and Fujitsu won the wholesale contract for the Post Office from BT Wholesale. Some had estimated this five-year contract to be worth as much as \u00a3500m, with TalkTalk providing the broadband/telephony access. Since 2012, though, there has been little talk regarding this contract. On further investigation, we believe this contract could be significant. The Post Office does not provide any specific figures regarding its customer numbers, but having called its call centre, it became clear to us that it has over 500,000 subscribers \u2013 making it the largest ISP after Everything Everywhere. If we assume TalkTalk takes 70% of the \u00a3100m a year contract value, this .. could imply an incremental \u00a317.5m of earnings per year. This is worth an incremental 20p to the TalkTalk share price and drives our increased discounted cash flow-driven valuation to 195p. This does not affect our fundamental longer-term thesis that both BT Sport and fibre will have a negative impact on the fundamentals of TalkTalk&apos;s business. However, despite the migration process for the Post Office contract starting at the end of the second quarter, nothing has been flagged ahead of the quarter.

That family portrait is significant not just in that it shows the Windsor line very much perpetuated \u2013 it also heralds a wider trend. The microcosm that is the nuclear family is being blasted apart by the accelerating growth of the four-generation &quot;beanpole&quot; household. Should we celebrate or ring the alarm? The royals, of course, have done this before. In 1894, at the baptism of the future Edward VIII, his great-grandmother, octogenarian Queen Victoria, was photographed, seated grimly holding her heir, in front of her son, the future Edward VII, and her grandson, the future George V. (&quot;An ugly baby,&quot; she is reported to have said, &quot;is a very nasty object.&quot;) A century and more later, it&apos;s not just the regal who are witnessing family life stretching and stretching again, both vertically because of the impact of an ageing population \u2013 every day, we lengthen our lives by five hours \u2013 and horizontally as divorce and separation make stepfamilies more the norm. So the long and stringy beanpole is born, shaped by couples having fewer children \u2013 which means fewer siblings, aunts and cousins \u2013 but related to more living generations, with all the joys and complications that may bring. As we continue to defy time, so expectations continue to be upended. A homemade poster seen draped on a motorway bridge recently, for instance, read: &quot;Happy 30th birthday, gran.&quot; Already, according to the charity Grandparents Plus, there are 14 million grandparents in the UK, half of whom have a living parent. A third also have a dependent child living with them, often with very little support. By 2020, 25% of the population will be 60 or older. The plus is that, for the first time on such a scale, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, young and middle-aged, have living history books close at hand. If they so choose, they can talk to the generation who may recall when Gone with the Wind was first published, when an admired Adolf Hitler became Time magazine&apos;s Man of the Year, or when prawn cocktail and black forest gateau had yet to become retro gastro chic, and cigarette smoke hung in the air of every pub and shop, like morning mist. For the partnership of the young and the very old, there&apos;s mischief and pleasure to be had in opening up the family closet. As George Bernard Shaw said: &quot;If you can&apos;t get rid of a family skeleton, you might as well make it dance.&quot; Cultural heritage and identity, the transmission of values, a sense of continuity, and the opportunity to learn who you are, make up part of the richness of the four-generation family, says Penny Mansfield of relationship charity One Plus One. But the flip side is that the distribution of power can be tricky. In some Asian families, for instance, the younger generations traditionally move in with the older generations, who may then rule a highly anachronistic roost. In Britain, the arrival of retirement and older age, conversely, is frequently seen as the pivotal point at which influence wanes for the nominal head of the family unless, of course, money is involved. Baby-boomer-generation grandparents and great-grandparents are an economic powerhouse. Far from hoarding their cash, they are often the ones forking out \u2013 while hopefully keeping sufficient back so there&apos;s enough in the kitty to pay for samba lessons at 95. Family Fortunes, a report published last week by thinktank the Social Market Foundation, points out that even in the poorest families the older generations regularly help younger members to get by. Some do much more. Grandparents now provide \u00a37.3bn of childcare \u2013 up from \u00a33.9bn in 2004. The so-called sandwich generation has become the club sandwich generation \u2013 as grandparents care for grandchildren, give domestic help to their own children and tend to the needs of possibly highly dependent nonagenarian parents and step-parents. Research tells us that, apparently, it does them good. A recent US study found that &quot;an emotionally close relationship between grandparent and grandchildren is associated with fewer symptoms of depression for both generations&quot;. Presumably, if the modern elastic family stretches to four and five and more generations, the benefits of reciprocity will similarly increase, as will the potential to sort out problems. &quot;If you are in an extended family in which there is respect and a willingness to exchange ideas,&quot; says Christine Northam, a counsellor with the charity Relate, &quot;when an issue does come up, such as an elderly relative who needs extra help, you can usually hack together a plan that shares the load.&quot; But she adds: &quot;If the functionality of the family is destructive, what you definitely need is space.&quot; Space and time are becoming the twin luxuries of the era, and both are the privilege of the very old. Last week, for instance, Nick Boles, the planning minister, blamed the rise of the four-generation family \u2013 rather than immigration \u2013 for an &quot;intense&quot; housing crisis that sees children in overcrowded houses and two-thirds of first-time buyers relying on help from parents. The number of households in England is projected to grow to 27.5m in 2033, an increase of 27% since 2008 \u2013 and two-thirds of these will be one-person households, a third of all householders aged over 65. To put it another way, granny and great-granny are each living in a big house that has been their home for decades and see little reason to move. So perhaps the challenge is to find another way of coping with the stretched-out family. In Singapore, for instance, the government has begun to build apartments aimed at three-generation families, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms. In the UK, organisations such as Older Women&apos;s Co-operative Housing (Owch) are trying to revive the idea of communal living. (It admits that such arrangements require a great deal of attention to boundaries, agreement on who does what and an appreciation of privacy \u2013 much like a marriage, in fact.) And some families with assets, and no desire to live in their own palace, pile everyone under one large roof. For writer Kate Mosse, the building that her own family, her parents and her inlaws call home was originally a nurses&apos; hostel. &quot;Not for us,&quot; she says, &quot;the silence of the empty nest.&quot; In 2009, members of the Housing an Ageing Population Panel for Innovation (part of the government&apos;s Homes and Communities Agency) visited several countries and were impressed by the imaginative solutions they saw. For example, in the Netherlands they saw flats in the centre of the city of Groningen, in a building that provides extra support to residents if and when required. But it was decorated as if it is part of this century, not a 1950s institution, with facilities such as a cafe, open to the whole community. So far, in this country, the magnets for attracting older people out of underoccupied accommodation are too often limited to a gated ghetto, a bedsit or a care home. We live in a time in which youth is revered, wisdom undervalued and the process of ageing feared. However, the strong and healthy multi-generational family \u2013and it does exist \u2013 may, as it becomes more common, end up acting as a corrective. Yes, the cost of Christmas may be stupendous (particularly once families become &quot;blended&quot; by remarriage and new partnerships), visiting duties might seem onerous at times, and triple doses of advice deeply annoying, but potentially this is also about the best of the ties that bind \u2013 the solidarity and affection, the connections and the mutual need. And while the older and very old are too often invisible in society, in a multi-generation setting, at the head of the living family tree, they are restored to their rightful place, esteemed for what they represent, who they are and what they have achieved."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/28/teaching-qualification-nick-clegg-course", "sentences": ["I write this from a conference on Education for Tomorrow run by Singapore Management University."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-28T10:05:52Z", "title": "Teaching is like parenting: you don't need to have a qualification | Anthony Seldon", "tags": ["Teaching", "Education", "Schools", "Free schools", "Education policy", "Politics", "Nick Clegg", "Liberal Democrats", "UK news"], "article": "Schoolteaching is a profession, but it&apos;s not like becoming a doctor or a vet. No one would want to be operated on by an amateur who hadn&apos;t had years of experience. The prospect of going to the dentist and being confronted by somebody with a lifelong passion for teeth but no university background or training would alarm all but the most steely. For that reason, there is no Teeth First, though we do have Teach First, albeit with intensive training. Nick Clegg and others who argue that teachers must first be qualified are fundamentally misunderstanding the nature of the profession. The teacher&apos;s role is much more akin to that of a parent. It is a great loss that governments worldwide have made teaching much less like being a parent than an impersonal civil servant. No job is more important than parenting, yet no one is suggesting parents go off for a university course to qualify as a parent. Parents pick it up as they go along, and that&apos;s exactly the way great teachers are forged. There is one fundamental difference between parenting and teaching. The former are self-selecting, whereas the latter have to be appointed by those with knowledge and experience. I write this from a conference on Education for Tomorrow run by Singapore Management University. The principals attending are from schools around the world, state and private, and almost all agree that great teaching is a gift that some have, and others will never acquire even if they spend 10 years locked away in a university. Most of us can tell within minutes whether someone has &quot;got it&quot; or not. What is the teacher X factor? It is simple: passion and intellect, heart and head, love of subject and love of children. Selfless compassion and tireless energy are not enough, however. Successful applicants need deep subject knowledge and the ability to communicate in ways that will inspire the young to want to learn. Those who care more about themselves, are time-watchers, and place pay and conditions above caring for the young will never make it. Teaching is a vocation as well as a profession. Rookie teachers have much to learn. But they will learn much better on the job than at a university. They learn by reflecting on their own experience of the teachers who inspired them, and by watching inspiring teachers in the schools to which they are attached. The best teachers I have known are constantly learning. Not to want to learn is both a shame and shameful, because no profession on earth has as much power to change large numbers of lives for the better. The very best teachers I have ever known are as eager to learn on the day they retire as on their first day in the classroom. I must declare an interest. Wellington College is a teaching school, where we work with a dozen state schools to train new entrants into the profession, and help them develop professionally. I wouldn&apos;t want to see university training disappear altogether, but I&apos;m glad that the bulk of training is now being done on the job. Showing trainee teachers the ropes is equally invigorating for experienced teachers. It helps them to keep their edge, encouraging them to reflect on their own practice, an essential prerequisite for all great teachers. So Clegg is plain wrong. But if he loses his job at the general election, I would certainly offer him a post, and not insist that he lose a year becoming qualified."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/29/from-one-arm-point-population-300-to-a-chinese-megacity", "sentences": ["The event would be held in Perth every two years and include athletes and students from not only China but other Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T01:40:07Z", "title": "From One Arm Point, population 300, to a Chinese megacity", "tags": ["Australia sport", "Sport", "Basketball"], "article": "Neon signs exhilarate. Hordes of people walk in all directions. Dotting the landscape, skyscrapers pierce the sky. For this group of uninitiated travellers, Shanghai is a surreal sight. Its frenetic pulse mesmerises, providing an intoxicating departure from normality. In mid-October, a Perth Indigenous female basketball team journeyed to the Chinese megacity as part of the Friendship Games \u2013 the fledgling Western Australia-China sports tournament. Included in that number was 15-year-old Johalia Davey hails from One Arm Point, a remote Aboriginal community north of Broome with a population of around 300 people. A stark contrast to Shanghai, the largest city in the world, with an estimated population close 20 million. Johalia says she relished her initiation outside of Australia after believing she would \u201cnever travel to another country\u201d. \u201cI was very nervous and frightened because I had never travelled that far before,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter a few days I got used to how different everything was and started to like being there. It is a completely different country and so far from Australia. \u201cI think many people there had never seen an aboriginal person before because they were taking a lot of photos of our team.\u201d Johalia and her team-mates \u2013 students from Clontarf Girls Academy and Perth College \u2013 comprised the basketball team. Inevitably, the inexperienced team, consisting of players mainly aged 13 and 14, were overwhelmed in all three of their matches against Chinese university sides. \u201cThe average height of our team is about 163cm and we were playing against teams with players close to 2m,\u201d coach Desiree Delcoure explains. However, results are trivial in the Games, which also feature swimming, and track and field. The event aims to strengthen relationship between WA and China, using sport as a tool to transcend cultural boundaries. The Friendship Games provides youth with an opportunity to embrace another culture, with many of the participants from backgrounds where venturing abroad is merely a pipedream. None of the basketball team\u2019s 10 players had travelled overseas previously, with most not possessing a passport until their Shanghai invitation.\u00a0 The girls did not only shoot hoops in Shanghai. They also savoured the local flavour through numerous cultural activities, including dragon boat racing. Delcoure believes positive transformation had consumed the girls in the trip\u2019s aftermath. \u201cWe had teachers at Clontarf comment on how the girls seem more confident and talkative since Shanghai,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an invaluable opportunity for the girls to visit another country and experience a different culture. I think it has broadened their horizons and will help shape them. It was an eye-opening experience, with some of the girls from very small communities.\u201d Life lessons were learned both on the court and in the street, says Johalia. \u201cI learned a lot about being on a team, trusting other people, and doing things I\u2019ve never done before,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was hard being away from my family but I managed to get through it.\u201d Now that the travel bug has left its indelible mark, Johalia hopes to travel to the United States one day. Four-time Olympian and former Perth Wildcats championship captain Andrew Vlahov helped found the Friendship Games. The basketballer-turned-businessman has ambitious plans to propel the event to new heights. Vlahov\u2019s vision is to transform the Games into the southern hemisphere\u2019s biggest youth festival by 2015. The event would be held in Perth every two years and include athletes and students from not only China but other Asian countries including Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. \u201cI am a firm believer that WA needs to integrate with Asia and sport&apos;s a great platform to build relationships,\u201d Vlahov says. \u201cWA has the opportunity to build a strong and unique relationship with Asia. The event would be a fusion of sport and the arts, with displays of music and art to help with the cultural understanding.\u201d Vlahov says the concept for the revamped Games has \u201cpopular support\u201d but concedes significant financial backing is needed for the project to be realised. \u201cWe need financial assistance from government and the private sector for this expansion of the event,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have made enquiries and discussions are taking place. The initial feedback has been really positive.\u201d Vlahov says the inspiration behind expanding the event is to \u201ccapture as many young people\u201d, particularly those enduring hardships. \u201cIt is an opportunity to give kids an opportunity they may not otherwise have,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to provide an inclusive policy, including possible participation from foster kids and those in the juvenile justice system. \u201cIt is brilliant seeing kids growing as people after experiencing another culture. It&apos;s important for our kids to understand different cultures.\u201d If Vlahov\u2019s dream materialises, WA\u2019s relationship with Asia will be stronger. Perhaps, more importantly, communities within WA will strengthen too.\u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2013/oct/29/international-school-students-cultural-identity", "sentences": ["Ask which part of England I&apos;m from, and I&apos;ll be forced to explain that I spent most of my childhood and part of my adolescence flitting around Asia: Taipei, Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing.", "I count with my fingers the way they do in Taiwan and I grew up eating roti in Singaporean food courts and goose fat noodles at my grandmother&apos;s house in Kaohsiung."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T10:49:20Z", "title": "International school students: rootless and without a home?", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Education", "International students"], "article": "Remy Shea is a sixth-form student at my international school in Beijing. When I ask her where she is from, she says: &quot;I&apos;m Canadian-Chinese but, at the same time, I&apos;m neither.&quot; Most students at my school aren&apos;t from one particular place. Sure, our passports might say we&apos;re British or Malaysian, but it&apos;s more complicated than that. Where you&apos;re &quot;from&quot; is less about birthplace and more about cultural identity; as an expat student your cultural identity ends up being difficult to categorise. If you ask me where I&apos;m from, I&apos;ll tell you I&apos;m English. Press me, and I&apos;ll say that I&apos;m also half Taiwanese. Ask which part of England I&apos;m from, and I&apos;ll be forced to explain that I spent most of my childhood and part of my adolescence flitting around Asia: Taipei, Shanghai, Singapore, Beijing. Though I was born in Guisborough in Yorkshire, I honestly couldn&apos;t point it out on a map or tell you anything about the place. Students like me are uniquely rootless; we don&apos;t belong anywhere and we can&apos;t describe ourselves as any one thing. Some find that they make their home wherever their family is. Some just accept the inherent loneliness that comes with the lack of concrete ties to any single place. Exir Kamalabadi, a year 13 student at my school, sums it up perfectly: &quot;I&apos;ll never be Chinese, no matter what I do.&quot; Replace &quot;Chinese&quot; with any other country, and you can understand the conflict within many &quot;third culture kids&quot;, as we&apos;ve been dubbed by the media. For me, I&apos;ll never be Taiwanese, no matter what I do. And, despite my predominantly English-influenced upbringing, I will never feel fully at home there either. I feel like a foreigner everywhere I go, a sentiment echoed by other students at international schools like mine. Mixed-race students who travel a lot while growing up can lack a cultural identity and also have to struggle with the fact that they don&apos;t have a history \u2013 or not one that&apos;s easily explained. Kamalabadi says: &quot;I very much feel like a cyber-age person, with bits and pieces of my background stuck together like a montage from the things I read, movies I watch and places I&apos;ve been.&quot; For me, a cultural identity is something I have to cultivate and maintain, not something that falls into place naturally. I&apos;ve heard my accent becoming progressively more American over the last five years. This is jarring because my vaguely British accent was the last real reminder of where I was born. Without it, how am I supposed to tell people I&apos;m from the UK? I&apos;ve had to make a concerted effort to retain my nondescript, regionally ambiguous &quot;English&quot; accent because without it, I don&apos;t have any proof that I was from the UK at all. My passport might as well have been Taiwanese. This lack of definition means that I&apos;ve ended up in a murky haze of different cultures, with bits and pieces from everywhere I&apos;ve lived and everyone I&apos;ve met. I count with my fingers the way they do in Taiwan and I grew up eating roti in Singaporean food courts and goose fat noodles at my grandmother&apos;s house in Kaohsiung. My accent is tinged with my friends&apos; American inflections, but I still spell colour with a &apos;u&apos; and lament the lack of Gregg&apos;s in China. I&apos;m incredibly grateful to have experienced all these aspects of different countries. I&apos;ve travelled the world and I have friends all over the globe, friends who understand both sides of my heritage and only occasionally mock my Chinese accent.

The Council of Australian Governments (Coag) reform council education report found widespread stagnation in literacy and numeracy skills among secondary school children, warning that students below the national minimum standard are &quot;at risk of being left behind&quot;. In years 7 and 9, children in the lowest socio-economic group experienced a decline in reading standards between 2008 and 2012, with &quot;large gaps&quot; in achievement at all levels between the richest and poorest students. In the report&apos;s main findings: \u2022 41% of disadvantaged young people are not engaged in work or study after leaving school, with the gap between them and wealthier students widening since 2006. \u2022 Year 12 attainment for the most disadvantaged students is 20% lower than the highest socio-economic group \u2013 a similar gap to 2006. \u2022 Overall, 27.3% of people aged 17 to 24 aren&apos;t engaged in work or study following school \u2013 an increase from 26.1% in 2006. While the number of young people in full-time study increased, this hasn&apos;t offset a significant dip in full-time employment levels. The prospects for Indigenous students appear particularly stark, with 60.6% not fully engaged in work or study after school, compared to 26% of non-Indigenous people. The report states: &quot;Indigenous children are more than twice as likely to start school developmentally vulnerable. There were no improvements in Indigenous school attendance over five years, with decreases in some years. &quot;Indigenous students are much less likely to meet the minimum standards in reading and numeracy. In five years nationally, only year 3 reading improved but year 3 and 7 numeracy declined.&quot; In its report card, which will be delivered to state and federal governments, the Coag reform council said progress was being made in just eight out of 22 educational benchmarks, with four showing a noticeable decline over the five years to 2012. Nationally, 85% of young people completed year 12 in 2011, up from 80.8% in 2006, although a Coag target of 90% completion by 2015 is unlikely to be achieved. There were &quot;significant increases&quot; in year 3 and year 5 reading and year 5 numeracy scores, according to the report, with a strengthening uptake of pre-school programs expected to reap benefits over the coming years. However, encouraging signs at primary school level, and the improved year 12 achievement rate, are tempered by a flat line, and even decline, in secondary school benchmarks. The report states Australia &quot;falls short&quot; of top-performing nations, with the proportion of students advanced in reading, maths and science &quot;well below&quot; countries such as Singapore.  In year 4 science, Australia&apos;s performance regressed from 10% at the advanced benchmark in 2007 to 7% in 2011. The report, a half-time progress update on 10-year educational goals agreed to by the states, presents a series of challenges for the new Coalition government, which has committed to following Labor&apos;s Better Schools/Gonski education plan, which calls for increased funding aimed at disadvantaged students. In a letter to Tony Abbott, the former Victorian premier John Brumby, who chaired the Coag council, said tackling educational disadvantage experienced by Indigenous and disadvantaged people &quot;remains a big challenge&quot;. &quot;The education outcomes for these groups are still poor,&quot; Brumby wrote. &quot;Large gaps in reading and numeracy achievement remain in place.&quot; Tony Nicholson, executive director of anti-poverty group Brotherhood of St Laurence, told Guardian Australia the results were &quot;disappointing and frustrating&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s particularly frustrating because we know the modern economy places a real premium on qualifications and skills,&quot; he said. &quot;For many of the young people we work with on a daily basis, this essentially means a life sentence of poverty and exclusion because they don&apos;t have the qualifications they need. &quot;This report shows that despite a welcome increase in the number of people with qualifications, significant numbers of young people don&apos;t have basic numeracy or literacy. They won&apos;t be able to get work, which will be a huge problem for them and also our economy as our population ages.&quot; Nicholson said funding that should help disadvantaged young people had, to date, been poorly administered. &quot;We have to start seeing students in an holistic way \u2013 if they are having problems at home or come from a refugee background that has no experience of a conventional school, that is going to impact their achievement level,&quot; he said. &quot;We can identify children in years 7 and 8 at risk of dropping out of school. We need to target resources to them in the right way, not just through teaching but also welfare support staff. The Gonski funding is very welcome, but we won&apos;t see much improvement if the money just goes to overall school expenditure.&quot; Lisa O&apos;Brien, chief executive of education support charity the Smith Family, said the report made &quot;incredibly worrying&quot; reading. &quot;If young Australians aren&apos;t achieving at school they are less likely to participate in broader society and we&apos;ll see problems in our justice system, among other things,&quot; she said. &quot;Too many kids we work with grow up not knowing someone in employment. We need more support, such as mentorship, and we need to direct it in a better, more co-ordinated way. There&apos;s always hope but the fact that so many disadvantaged young people are going backwards is really concerning.&quot; Greg Craven, the deputy chairman of the Coag council, told Guardian Australia the report was a mix of &quot;good and less good&quot;. &quot;If you want a very glass half full view you&apos;ll see there are improvements at primary school and year 12 and hopefully they will meet up together at the end of the 10-year reform,&quot; he said. &quot;But clearly literacy and numeracy in secondary schools isn&apos;t going the way we want and every bad result is particularly bad for disadvantaged young people. Indigenous achievement clearly isn&apos;t moving in the right direction.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/oct/29/hugh-de-wardener", "sentences": ["After service in Britain he was drafted to Singapore in 1942, a month before it fell to the Japanese, and became a prisoner of war."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T14:55:40Z", "title": "Hugh de Wardener obituary", "tags": ["Medical research", "Medicine", "France", "Second world war", "Doctors", "Hospitals"], "article": "Hugh de Wardener, who has died aged 97, pioneered kidney dialysis in Britain, performed the UK&apos;s first renal biopsies, enabling accurate diagnosis, and wrote the definitive textbook on the kidney, first published in 1958. He showed that salt raises blood pressure, that long-term antibiotics prevent urinary infections in susceptible adults and that Wernicke&apos;s encephalopathy, a neurological condition usually seen in alcoholics, was caused not by drink but by vitamin B1 deficiency. De Wardener came from an aristocratic French family who had fled to Austria during the revolution. A later generation migrated to America. His parents met when his US-born father, a commodity broker, was living in Paris, and his mother, also an American, was taking singing lessons there. He was born in Paris. After his parents divorced, he was sent to boarding school in Sussex not speaking a word of English. He went on to Malvern college, Worcestershire, and to St Thomas&apos; hospital medical school. He qualified in 1939 and took a house physician post in Scunthorpe. Within a week his consultant died in a road accident, leaving De Wardener to cope single-handed with 100 medical and paediatric patients. Six months later De Wardener joined the army. After service in Britain he was drafted to Singapore in 1942, a month before it fell to the Japanese, and became a prisoner of war. He spent the remaining three war years looking after soldiers who were forced to build the Burma-Siam railway, as fictionalised in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). A fellow prisoner, John Coast, published a novel, Railroad of Death (1946), describing the camp&apos;s caring and brilliant &quot;Dr Ginger de Hugenot [sic]&quot;. De Wardener successfully treated diphtheria in allied PoWs by using an antiserum he made from the blood of other patients. When running a cholera ward in the PoW camp he recognised that some malnourished patients had Wernicke&apos;s encephalopathy. He confirmed this by autopsy and recognised that it was dietary. He treated it by getting the Japanese to supply Marmite. After the autopsies he preserved the prisoners&apos; brains in formalin, and when the camp was abandoned and the Japanese were destroying evidence of their maltreatment, he buried them with notes in a sealed drum in a prisoner&apos;s grave. This was later excavated and his research was published in a classic 1947 Lancet paper. De Wardener was repatriated in 1945, having suffered jaundice, diphtheria, cholera, malaria and malnutrition, to find he had tuberculosis. After a brief convalescence he became registrar at St Thomas&apos; hospital. He immediately started researching kidney function, doing many uncomfortable experiments on himself and colleagues. In 1960 he was appointed professor of medicine at Charing Cross hospital medical school. At that time, kidney failure was considered a death sentence. Having heard the US physician Belding Scribner describe the first patients on dialysis, De Wardener introduced it at Charing Cross in 1964. After &quot;retiring&quot; in 1981 he continued working, collaborating on kidney function with Graham MacGregor of St George&apos;s hospital, Tooting. In 2004, he gave the first of the annual De Wardener lectures at Charing Cross hospital, which was received with acclaim. In 1961 he founded what is now Kidney Research UK. Realising how hard it is to be on thrice-weekly dialysis, he established a holiday fund for patients and a seaside dialysis &quot;hotel&quot; in Emsworth, Hampshire. De Wardener was appointed CBE in 1982 and was president of the International Society of Nephrology from 1969 to 1972 and of the Renal Association from 1973 to 1976. The US National Library of Medicine lists 223 papers by him, the last published in 2012. In 1969 he married his fourth wife, Josephine Storey, the nurse who established Charing Cross&apos;s dialysis unit with him. He is survived by Josephine and their two sons, and by a son and daughter from his previous marriages all of which ended in divorce. In his last months he suffered from peripheral neuropathy, a legacy of the prison camps. He died in the De Wardener ward, the intensive care renal unit at Hammersmith hospital. \u2022 Hugh Edward de Wardener, physician, born 8 October 1915; died 29 September 2013 \u2022 This article was amended on 30 October.

The fine, the second largest for Libor rigging after the \u00a3940m paid by Swiss bank UBS, was the fifth levied by regulators on both sides of the Atlantic in their attempt to crackdown on the manipulation of the key interest rate. It comes as a new investigation begins into similar allegations of manipulation in the \u00a33tn-a-day currency markets. UBS and Deutsche Bank became the latest to admit they were co-operating with investigations into currency benchmarks, as the US justice department acknowledged for the first time it was involved. As Piet Moerland, the Rabobank chairman, announced he would step aside earlier than planned, regulators said some of the bank&apos;s traders had colluded with rivals at other financial firms to move rates to make a profit in one of the worst such cases they had investigated. About 30 individuals were involved, according to the mutually-owned bank \u2013 which was set up in 1898 to fund Dutch farmers and until now had escaped the financial crisis virtually unscathed and without needing the taxpayer bailouts handed to rivals. There were 500 instances of attempted Libor manipulation, directly or indirectly involving at least nine managers. One manager facilitated a culture in Rabobank&apos;s offices in New York, London, Utrecht, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore where attempted manipulation appeared to be accepted or even endorsed by the bank, regulators said. Rabobank has also entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US department of justice. The regulators unleashed the customary cache of emails containing colourful language used by traders. One manager said to a trader that he was &quot;fast turning into [that trader&apos;s] bitch!!!!&quot;. Another was offered &quot;546 beers&quot; for changing rates. &quot;Don&apos;t worry mate \u2013 there&apos;s bigger crooks in the market than us guys!&quot; one submitter wrote. Moerland, who had been with the bank \u2013 which prides itself on its integrity and its roots in the agricultural business \u2013 for 30 years, said he was shocked by the practices uncovered. The bank did not lose its AAA rating until 2011. &quot;I sincerely regret that a number of Rabobank employees acted in an inappropriate manner. This should never have taken place at Rabobank,&quot; said Moerland. &quot;The conduct of these individuals, and the language of some of the individuals&apos; communications, has shocked me. Rabobank fully understands the sense of indignation that this will cause both within our organisation and more broadly.&quot; The US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said Rabobank employees had been making submissions to Libor that they saw at the time as &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;obseenly [sic] high&quot; and &quot;silly low&quot;. Libor \u2013 set in a number of currencies by special &quot;submitters&quot; at so-called panel banks \u2013 is supposed to be the price that banks would charge each other to borrow in the markets and is used to price about \u00a3300tn of contracts around the world. But Rabobank sat its submitters next to its traders and in some cases traders assumed the role of submitter. One of its US dollar traders was known as the &quot;Ambassador&quot; or &quot;Ambass&quot; while one of its submitters was referred to as &quot;madame cadburry&quot;, according to documents released by the regulators. The Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 which is levying \u00a3105m of the total fine \u2013 said the bank had no regard to the integrity of the market. Tracey McDermott, the FCA&apos;s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: &quot;Rabobank&apos;s misconduct is among the most serious we have identified on Libor. Traders and submitters treated Libor submissions as a potential way to make money, with no regard for the integrity of the market. This is unacceptable.&quot; The fine is largely related to yen Libor and, to a lesser extent, dollars and sterling. None of the individuals were identified by the FCA although some were referred to by job titles by the US regulators. The FCA, along with other regulators, has fined Swiss bank UBS, RBS and Icap, as well as Barclays, the first bank to be fined, in June 2012. In June, Moerland said he would retire from the bank next year. He is replaced by Rinus Minderhoud, a member of the supervisory board since 2002. Moerland acknowledged that Rabobank had not appreciated the risk involved in setting Libor and its euro equivalent, Euribor. &quot;We have taken severe disciplinary measures against employees directly involved in or otherwise responsible for the unacceptable conduct,&quot; he added.

Yesterday, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) rescinded the invitations of several journalists to attend a public briefing regarding a multilateral trade agreement under negotiation called the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP). The TPP is an extensive agreement that covers typical topics such as goods and services, but also contains chapters on labour laws, intellectual property, the environment and investor-state dispute settlement provisions. This agreement is currently being negotiated completely opaquely between the US, Japan, Australia, Peru, Malaysia, Vietnam, New Zealand, Chile, Singapore, Canada, Mexico, and Brunei Darussalam. DFAT claims that it will be finished negotiating by the end of the year. If you&apos;ve never heard of the TPP, here&apos;s a summary of the major issues:  Complete lack of transparency. Beyond limited information handed out in public briefings and private meetings, there is almost no information as to the specifics of the text. We only know what is in the agreement due to leaks, and from what little we can glean, it is bad. The intellectual property chapter. There have been very few leaks of TPP text, but when the IP chapter leaked in 2011 it showed that a concluded agreement containing a chapter similar to this would include extensive negative provisions that affect Australia&apos;s ability to maintain or reform its own patent and copyright legislation in the best interests of Australia. The inclusion of investor-state dispute settlement provisions. DFAT attests that any such clause would not apply to Australia, but the Liberals have previously stated they would support the introduction of ISDS, so this position is subject to change.  The TPP could criminalise copyright infringement done without commercial benefit, ban parallel importation, expand copyright terms, and limit our ability to enact the reforms recommended by the Australian Law Reform Committee&apos;s copyright review. Right now we don&apos;t know exactly what will be in the TPP, because it&apos;s kept completely secret, unless you&apos;re fortunate enough to be a wealthy lobbying organisation in the United States, who are provided access to the text through the US Trade Representative (USTR), and have direct input into it. This leads to a protectionist agreement, not a free trade agreement. As of yesterday, journalists were barred from attending a briefing to be held on Wednesday afternoon in Sydney. The justification provided was that these briefings are considered &quot;off the record&quot;, but that DFAT is quite happy to provide an event tailored specifically for journalists. Of course, we wouldn&apos;t want journalists to see the difficult questions being asked by the stakeholders in civil society, and have the non-answers provided by the bureaucrats marked down on the public record for all to see, criticise and remember, would we now? This demonstrates the sheer level of unnecessary secrecy afforded to these negotiations of an agreement that could have a profound impact on our domestic legislation. The Pirate Party has been actively pursuing the Government regarding the TPP since 2012, making countless freedom of information requests in an attempt to shed some light on this secretive agreement. Making a request for the text itself is immediately rejected on the grounds that it is exempt under section 33 of the Freedom of Information Act. Our most recent request to IP Australia regarding TPP related documents and gene patenting ended up costing us $1080, which we crowdfunded on Pozible. We hit our target in less than an hour. The result: about a thousand blacked-out pages, some publicly available information and insightful emails such as the negotiating team nearly booking the wrong hotel in the US, but basically nothing regarding the content of the TPP. Not good enough. DFAT&apos;s page on the TPP is limited at best, filled with weasel words about the &quot;potential benefits&quot; of the agreement, and an FAQ that says more by what&apos;s missing than it does by what&apos;s there. Without accountability and transparency, democracy falters. Trade agreements negotiated completely behind closed doors are a recipe for protectionist agreements, not free trade agreements. In an increasingly digital society, the justification for opacity in trade negotiations has met its demise, and it&apos;s time that we see modern legal instruments negotiated in a transparent and inclusive manner in order to get the best outcome for our country. We urge the Abbott Government to release the TPP text before it&apos;s too late to fix. Let&apos;s not cripple Australian innovation in the interests of American profits.

This week&apos;s announcement that the expected coalition between Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats in Germany will prioritise the tax&apos;s implementation, is a sign that the proposal remains on track. But any measure that taxes or regulates financial markets and banks will always meet concerted opposition. In recent weeks, this has been growing from some quarters. The latest criticism, from France&apos;s central bank governor Christian Noyer, was splashed on the front page of Monday&apos;s Financial Times: &quot;France central bank chief says Robin Hood tax is &apos;enormous risk&apos;&quot; ran the headline. As this extremely small tax is to be implemented by 11 European countries, it is appropriate to ask: an enormous risk for whom? Certainly it will impact on trades with short time horizons \u2013 high-frequency traders, whose computer algorithms fire off thousands of trades in microseconds, will undoubtedly have their business dramatically curtailed. Yet this will significantly reduce rather than create risk. Many regulators are concerned about the risk of this high-frequency trading, which now accounts for over half of trades on the London Stock Exchange. As demonstrated by the infamous flash crash of May 2010, when liquidity drained from the market and the Dow Jones index dropped 9% in a matter of minutes, it poses a threat to wider economic stability. By contrast, the impact on a typical long-term investor is likely to be negligible. There are already many transaction costs such as trading commissions, spreads, clearing, settlement, exchange fees and administration costs. Prof Avinash Persaud, a former JP Morgan executive, has estimated that the FTT of 0.1% on stocks and bonds, and 0.01% for derivatives will comprise of only 5% of annual transaction costs for long-term equity holders, taking levels back to those experienced 10 years ago. Compared to management fees \u2013 typically about 1% charged by many financial institutions which are now lining up to oppose the FTT \u2013 it is hard to conclude the tax will have more than a marginal impact on costs for long-term investors, like corporates and pension funds. The net result is that an FTT would slow short-term trades, which are mainly unproductive, helping to reduce the risk of crises that are so detrimental to growth. Furthermore, the potential \u20ac30bn in revenue the European FTT could raise, could be invested productively, for example in infrastructure and innovation, encouraging much needed future growth and employment and making European countries more competitive. Noyer and others worry unnecessarily that the tax will lead to an exodus of bankers from participating countries. But the issuer principle embedded in the EU proposal means that attempts by banks and their subsidiaries to duck the tax by migrating to other jurisdictions will not work, since the FTT would be paid by all those transacting the eleven countries&apos; bonds and shares, wherever they are based. Thus the tax, from a transaction in say a French bond taking place between parties in New York and Singapore, will still be collected by French authorities. But this need not be a debate about hypotheticals. Major financial sectors such as the United States, Hong Kong and South Korea already have FTTs which together raise tens of billions in revenue annually without causing economic damage. In the UK we have the very successful stamp duty, an FTT on share transactions that raises more than \u00a33bn a year, of which 40% is paid by foreign-based investors and banks. It too rightly taxes all those trading UK shares, wherever they are based. This is the same principle on which the European FTT will be based. Fortunately, the European commission is clearly supportive of the proposal, as is the European parliament. Eleven European countries, representing 66% of European GDP, remain committed to implementing the tax. It is encouraging that in coalition talks between the German SPD and CDU, they achieved clear consensus on the FTT. This is not surprising, as in Germany 82% of citizens, according to Euro-barometer, support a European FTT. In France this figure reaches 72%, and the EU average is 64%. Let&apos;s hope politicians elsewhere will listen to their voters and fully implement the tax soon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/31/darling-monster-diana-cooper-jj-norwich-review", "sentences": ["The identical combination of intransigence and flirtation was deployed whether angling for an invitation to stay with the Duke of Alba, or getting past the military official in Singapore who told her that women were not permitted to travel on bombers.", "It took &quot;a lot of bother&quot; but she duly joined her husband on the two-engine Hudson for a perilous flight from Singapore to Jakarta, resigned to the indignity of a parachute harness."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T12:00:00Z", "title": "Darling Monster: the letters of Lady Diana Cooper to her son  1939-1952 \u2013 review", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Autobiography and memoir", "Biography"], "article": "Like many of her contemporaries, Diana Cooper had a passion for nicknames. Her letters from the 1940s are sprinkled with references to Duckling, Coalbox, Wormwood and Dodgems. The first three were Winston\u00a0Churchill, Sybil Colefax (the interior decorator) and Charles de Gaulle respectively. Dodgems was a car, the Austin 7 in which she careered along the roads and occasionally the pavements of London. The combination of subjects, and the free-associating indiscretion with which she wrote about them to her 10-year-old son, say much about the woman and her world. An aristocrat, a beauty and a wit, she was for much of her life the glamorous spider at the heart of a vast web of connections. One of her many admirers was Evelyn Waugh (Mr Wu), who turned her into the arch-fixer Mrs Stitch in Scoop, energetically directing operations from her bed, where, her son confirms, she wrote most of her letters. Waugh depicts her signing cheques with one hand and with the telephone in the other, &quot;dictating details of the costumes for a charity ballet&quot;, while her maid reads her the clues to the Times crossword and &quot;an\u00a0elegant young man&quot;, recognisable as Rex Whistler, paints ruined castles on the ceiling. The reality was naturally more complicated and her letters, edited here by her son, reveal the sometimes vulnerable, often self-mocking and occasionally reflective character behind the perfect maquillage, so often photographed by Cecil Beaton. What she liked was &quot;moving on and new continents and blue skies and a new life&quot;, and in the 13 years the letters cover she found plenty to like. When the correspondence began in 1939 she was 47 and had been married for 20 years to\u00a0Duff Cooper, a diplomat-turned-politician. The war saw him travel first to America for a lecture tour to raise support for the allies, followed by a period as minister of information, before being sent on a fruitless and dangerous mission to the far east in 1941 to assess the state of defences. Later he was posted to Algiers, De Gaulle&apos;s free French capital in exile, and after the war to Paris as British ambassador. His wife went with him everywhere. She was of course a brilliant &quot;ambassadress&quot;. More surprisingly perhaps, she was ready to rough it when required. Part of her charm, as Waugh implies, was that she applied the same method to every problem. The identical combination of intransigence and flirtation was deployed whether angling for an invitation to stay with the Duke of Alba, or getting past the military official in Singapore who told her that women were not permitted to travel on bombers. It took &quot;a lot of bother&quot; but she duly joined her husband on the two-engine Hudson for a perilous flight from Singapore to Jakarta, resigned to the indignity of a parachute harness. &quot;Nothing looks so shameful as straps between the legs in a skirt.&quot; As patchily educated as most debutantes, her intelligence found its way out in prose larded indiscriminately with quotations from Shakespeare, Noel Coward and music-hall songs. It often rambled, sometimes tangling itself up in a well-mixed metaphor \u2013 &quot;My life has hobbled along hectically on a broken wing,&quot; she reported in 1948 \u2013 but it could come, when required, to a sharp point. Reporting on a visit to the MP and socialite &quot;Chips&quot; Channon, she told her son that she had found on arrival &quot;the Duchess of Kent, her sister Countess Toren, the reigning Prince and Princess of Liechtenstein, the Ranee of Kapurthala and the King of Egypt&apos;s sister. It was like a stamp album.&quot; She excelled at cameos, mostly unflattering. If Waugh saw her as Mrs\u00a0Stitch, she saw him &quot;portly as an alderman, dressed in loud and shapeless checks&quot;. The letters are crowded with famous faces lit from unfamiliar angles: HG Wells, losing his temper when offered a second-rate prize on a hoopla stall, Hilaire Belloc tearing his trousers on Dodgems. The royal family were particular favourites. Despite leaving Buckingham Palace after an intimate lunch with George VI feeling &quot;thrilled, amused and loyal&quot;, she was not too loyal to describe Queen Elizabeth as &quot;a balloon about to take off covered in two-way stretch dove-grey&quot; or to notice that she got &quot;very pink in the face&quot;, and that &quot;they say she puts a lot back. Port in lashings.&quot; Queen Mary with shoes like skis, Princess Margaret &quot;commonly but most becomingly dressed as an edible little tart&quot; and Wallis Simpson fizzy on\u00a0Benzedrine \u2013 at times it feels as if Madame Tussaud&apos;s House of Windsor display has been moved into the Chamber of Horrors. The framework for all of this was the\u00a0Coopers&apos; intricate marriage. She tolerated Duff&apos;s many and flagrant infidelities. He accepted her determination to have her own way about almost everything else, even when her insistence on evacuating their only child, John Julius to America, made Duff, then minister of information, the target of vicious press criticism. It was by any standards an unusual relationship, but the candour with which she wrote to her son about it is perhaps even more remarkable. &quot;There was a big row tonight between Papa and me undressing and in different stages of nudity,&quot; she explained, while they were &quot;hunkered down in the Dorchester&quot; during the blitz. She wanted to take shelter in the basement during a raid, but he was reluctant. &quot;&apos;You&apos;re too unkind&apos; I&apos;d say, pulling off a stocking.&quot; The family emerges as an emotional menage \u00e0 trois, with Diana at the centre treating her husband at times like a child and her son, as he got older, like a husband. When he was 23, she wrote to John Julius that although she would fight any battle on his behalf, when all was going well with him &quot;I\u00a0must be courted and petted and needed or I can&apos;t react. I was ever so, with lovers too.&quot; For all their quick observations, the letters do not suggest much empathy, even with her son. They are a monologue with asides, written \u2013 as she acknowledged \u2013 largely as a journal for herself. In 1948, after Duff was replaced as ambassador, the Coopers retired to their house at Chantilly. From then on there is a marked change of mood in the letters. Ageing, sometimes unwell and worried about her husband&apos;s even\u00a0shakier health, she was in increasing need of being petted. Even\u00a0the pleasure of tormenting the\u00a0Harveys, their successors at the embassy, whose lives she made as miserable as possible through her myriad connections, was not enough to\u00a0stave off the &quot;melancholia&quot; that had always alternated with her bursts of energy. Ennui and various &quot;cures&quot; now became a recurring theme. With the role of &quot;ambassadress&quot;, she had lost, she reflected, not only a beautiful house, once the home of Pauline Borghese, but also &quot;the power to give\u00a0pleasure&quot;. That perhaps was the key to her temperament. In an age and\u00a0class where women&apos;s influence had\u00a0to be exercised obliquely, she had understood how to use an acceptably feminine desire to please as a means to build a power base. The book is much too long. There are not enough plums for so much pudding, but the self-portrait it offers of a woman whose natural vivacity was often a bulwark against pessimism and despair is oddly poignant. Writing from Chantilly in October 1949, having been kept awake by Willow, her husband&apos;s temperamental and messy dog, she reports that the weather in the morning was nevertheless glorious and\u00a0&quot;The day was beautiful enough to forget the night&quot;. It would have made a good epigraph for a collection of letters whose real subject is its author. \u2022 Rosemary Hill&apos;s books include God&apos;s Architect, about Augustus Pugin."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/oct/31/bill-de-blasio-stephen-bubb-acevo-shaw-trust-work-programme", "sentences": ["\u2022 Social Enterprise Buzz yesterday reported on a new mentoring program for social enterprises - to be launched by Singapore&apos;s Ministry of Social and Family Development this December."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-31T12:12:49Z", "title": "Social enterprise today: Thursday 31 October", "tags": ["Social enterprises", "Society", "Social enterprise"], "article": "Good afternoon and a big welcome to the Guardian Social Enterprise Network&apos;s daily digest \u2013 offering the latest news, advice and analysis from the sector. \u2022 On the network today Stephen Bediako, founder and managing director of The Social Innovation Partnership, argues that evidence and measurement are vital to the future of social programmes. \u2022 In today&apos;s news, Forbes reported that Democrat Bill de Blasio - the frontrunner in the New York City mayoral election - has reiterated his support for a policy which advocates the government having a say in how private donors direct their charitable contributions.

The players were pretty tired too. Approaching midnight on a Wednesday and no one could make sense of it all; a few hours&apos; sleep later, Thursday now, time for work, they still couldn&apos;t. All they knew was that they&apos;d enjoyed it; every mad minute of it. Uppers, downers, screamers and laughers, it had been some trip. Where to start? How about at the end? When a game ends with a 91st-minute free-kick and the men standing over it giggling are Alvaro Arbeloa and Sergio Ramos, when the two most expensive players in history walk away grinning &quot;go on then, your turn&quot;, and when a brilliant Ramos curler follows, stopped by an equally brilliant save and you think: &quot;makes sense tonight,&quot; you know something&apos;s happened. Something? Everything. &quot;It lacked balance,&quot; said Carlo Ancelotti. Sod balance. It had everything else: more than 30 shots, one red card, three penalties, none of which were, three very particular celebrations, points proven, and 10 goals. Ten. The highest total at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u since the 1967-68 season, even though both goalkeepers had been superb. Sevilla scored three and, for the first time in history, two penalties were given against Madrid at home, but still the visitors lost by four. It finished 7-3. And even the scoreline is deceptive: if that suggests a game that was always Madrid&apos;s, think again. The shot count is almost identical, 18 to 17, and the game stays alive, at least until the last 15 minutes. Fans are dragged into it, fighting for breath. Coming off the cl\u00e1sico defeat, the night had started with whistles. It ended in an ovation, a kind of exhausted, empty, satisfied ovation. They could almost have laid back and lit up a cigarette. Gareth Bale curls in a belting first and a deflected free-kick makes it 2-0. A penalty follows, a hat-trick perhaps? Cristiano Ronaldo, though, takes it. He has a point to prove. Only 31 minutes gone and it&apos;s 3-0 and Madrid are flying. After 39 minutes it&apos;s 3-2. Two in two minutes, first Ivan Rakitic, then Carlos Bacca. Game on. On 52 it&apos;s 4-2, Karim Benzema assisted by Bale; on 59 it&apos;s 5-2, Ronaldo assisted by Bale. Game off again. But on 62 it&apos;s 5-3. Rakitic scores the goal of the night, swinging in a gorgeous, deliberate 20-yarder. Ten minutes later, he has a penalty to make it 5-4. But 10 and a half minutes later it&apos;s 6-3: Rakitic misses, at the other end Ronaldo doesn&apos;t. Benzema then adds his second, Madrid&apos;s seventh. Ramos nearly makes it eight. &quot;Beautiful lunacy,&quot; El Pa\u00eds calls it. Ancelotti calls it &quot;mad&quot;. &quot;It was a crazy game,&quot; Bale smiles. The world&apos;s most expensive player makes his first start at home and scores two, provides two and plays 90 minutes. There are two more chances too: one flies just over, the other, a neat one-two with Benzema, is pushed away by Beto. What he does get is two goals with his left foot, two assists with his right. &quot;Ten out of ten&quot; declares AS, naming him the &quot;motor of the game&quot;, the not-at-all-forced award sponsored by a car. &quot;As well as talent he has a guardian angel,&quot; runs Juanma Trueba&apos;s match report. &quot;He&apos;s accompanied by a chorus of fat little trumpet players with wings.&quot; Marca calls it an &quot;exhibition.&quot; They mean Bale, but the whole thing was. By the end, it is impossible to keep up. In one headline, Bale is likened to legend Ferenc Puskas, the man who one team-mate lovingly says &quot;played pregnant&quot; but had a left foot that was a &quot;scandal&quot;. &quot;Ca\u00f1onito [little cannon] Bale,&quot; runs the headline, drawing on the Hungarian&apos;s &quot;Ca\u00f1onito pum!&quot; [little cannon, bang!] nickname. But it is Ronaldo who overtakes Puskas to become the club&apos;s fifth all-time top scorer. Bale is one of three players to get two goals, along with Benzema and Rakitic. But Ronaldo outscores them all. He scores a hat-trick against Sevilla for the fourth season in a row. Oye, y si jugamos cada semana? Can we play you every week? The timing could not be better \u2026 time for a celebration. When Bale scores, he leaps into the air and then does that heart thing. Benzema, meanwhile, runs to the bench to embrace Zinedine Zidane. As for Ronaldo, he stands to attention, saluting. Sepp Blatter had made the &quot;worst mistake of his life,&quot; according to AS&apos;s resident mad Madridista Tom\u00e1s Roncero. Worse than the Qatar thing or the short shorts thing or the racism thing or the [obscured on legal advice] thing. During the week, someone finds a video on line. At Oxford University, Blatter performs his drunk granddad at a wedding routine, a 77- year-old trying to make a bunch of 18-year-old students laugh. Asked about Lionel Messi and Ronaldo, Blatter jokes that one spends more on the hairdresser than the other \u2013 a deeply offensive slight to Messi who he&apos;s basically accusing of having rubbish hair \u2013 and admits that he likes &quot;them both very much&quot; but prefers the Argentinian. &quot;Leonard&quot; Messi, he says, &quot;is the good boy that every father would love to have&quot; while the &quot;other one&quot; \u2026 He pauses then lurches up to perform a military march but he looks more like some robotic dinosaur whose batteries are dying, which when you think about it \u2026 &quot;Ronaldo is like a commander,&quot; he says. Ronaldo says he &quot;understands certain things&quot; now. Banners supporting him are dotted round the Bernab\u00e9u. He wants to score. So although Bale&apos;s on a hat-trick, he wants the penalty. He scores and two more follow taking him to a completely insane 157 league goals in 146 league games, 219 in 213 overall. He salutes. The slightest hint of a smirk stretches across his face. As responses go, this time it&apos;s pretty well impeccable, funny too, a break from the hysteria, paranoia and affected outrage of the previous 24 hours. &quot;Commander Ronaldo,&quot; cheers the cover of AS; &quot;Madrid present arms,&quot; says Marca. &quot;Blatter didn&apos;t exactly do us a favour,&quot; sighs Rakitic afterwards. &quot;And nor did Barcelona.&quot; Week 11 talking points It wasn&apos;t just Madrid-Sevilla. Apparently, it was Week 11 in the league, but it was hard enough to know what day it was. La Liga was in the middle of an 11-day run of league games: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday ... it is Wednesday, right? \u2026 Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Three &apos;weeks&apos;, 10, 11 and 12, running into each other, including the cl\u00e1sico; three matches each, crammed into seven days, everything changes, everyone sucked in. Everyone except the people who actually run the league. Friday&apos;s a day off, you see. Seriously: players who got suspended in Week 11 will all play in week 12 because the committee will not meet on Friday to ratify their suspensions. Meanwhile, down in Seville, Betis&apos;s ultras invaded a training session and held a team meeting in the manager&apos;s office. New tactics: show your bollocks. In Vigo, Barcelona equal their best ever start: 10 wins, one draw, beating Celta 3-0. In Valladolid, 2-0 down becomes 2-2 and a last minute penalty to win it. Ebert shoots, but Bravo saves. In Pamplona, Osasuna escape the relegation zone and Rayo return to it. And down in bat country, Almer\u00eda&apos;s goalkeeper, who&apos;s older than his manager, saves his manager and they clinch their first win of the season, beating Valencia 2-1 at Mestalla. The home fans whip out the white hankies while in the boardroom they decide it&apos;s probably time to sack the manager again. There&apos;s one small problem: the president said the manager would stay &quot;no matter what&quot; ... and, anyway, the president is in Singapore. As the final minutes approach, the fear claws at Almer\u00eda&apos;s nerves. They have been here before and have always blown it, defeat snatched from the jaws of victory.

The revised maths curriculum \u2013 which comes into force in September 2015 \u2013 expands the range of topics that pupils are expected to learn, while the new curriculum for GCSE English literature and language courses will place a greater emphasis on spelling, punctuation and grammar. The education secretary, Michael Gove, said the introduction of a more demanding maths curriculum was to improve the attainment of pupils in England compared with their counterparts in other advanced industrial countries. &quot;The new mathematics GCSE will be more demanding and we anticipate that schools will want to increase the time spent teaching mathematics,&quot; Gove said in a written statement to parliament announcing the changes on Friday. &quot;On average, secondary schools in England spend only 116 hours per year teaching mathematics, which international studies show is far less time than that spent on this vital subject by our competitors. Just one extra lesson each week would put England closer to countries like Australia or Singapore, who teach 143 and 138 hours a year of mathematics respectively.&quot; According to the Department for Education (DfE), the new maths syllabus adds a section on ratio, proportion and rates of change, as well as vectors and conditional probability. Students will have to learn key formulae, such as the quadratic formula, sine and cosine rules. Under the existing syllabus, the formulae are provided in exam papers. An international survey of adult skills published last month found that 16- to 24-year-olds in England ranked 21st for numeracy out of 24 countries. Pupils in England were ranked 27th in maths in the international assessment known as Pisa conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2009. The new curriculum for GCSE English literature will see pupils studying at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one 19th century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 that includes Romantic poetry, and British fiction or drama from 1914 onwards. The revised exam will require the analysis of unseen texts, which the DfE says will reward students who have read widely. The new English language course requirements increase the proportion of marks awarded for accurate use of spelling, punctuation and grammar. It will award 20% of exam marks for spelling, punctuation and grammar, compared with 12% under the current requirements. &quot;The new GCSEs in English and mathematics set higher expectations. They demand more from all students and provide further challenge for those aiming to achieve top grades,&quot; Gove said. The revised curriculum comes alongside details of new GCSE examinations announced by the exam regulator, Ofqual. The exams \u2013 which will first be taken for maths and English in 2017 \u2013 will end the use of A* to G letter grades in favour of a numbered scale from nine to one, with nine being the highest grade. Ofqual confirmed that course modules and assessment would be dropped, with grades determined by a single end-of-course examination for most GCSE subjects. The DfE said it wopuld announce the revised curricula for most of the remaining GCSE subjects in spring next year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/01/bitcoin-currency-for-travellers", "sentences": ["Speaking from their Singapore hotel on the final day of the challenge, the couple describe their experience as a case of &quot;feast and famine.&quot; &quot;When we first arrived in Stockholm, we were exhausted from our flight and just went to sleep,&quot; says Craig.", "But in Singapore it&apos;s been hard because we&apos;re in a city with amazing food and there are only three restaurants we can eat in.&quot; It is unlikely that Craig and Bingham&apos;s journey would have been possible without the help of online travel agency Simply Travel.", "Looking at where existing clusters of bitcoin businesses exist led Craig and Bingham to Kreuzberg in Berlin, as well as Stockholm and Singapore where the currency is taking off."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-01T15:32:00Z", "title": "The Bitcoin travellers: round the world using online currency only", "tags": ["Travel", "Bitcoin", "Technology", "Cryptocurrencies"], "article": "Negotiating foreign currencies can be a headache for any traveller. Persuading someone to accept payment in a currency they&apos;ve never even heard of presents a new challenge altogether. But after 100 days on the road, newlyweds Austin Craig and Beccy Bingham have proved that it is possible to travel the world using nothing but bitcoin. The bitcoin currency, best known for its association with illicit purchases made through sites such as Silk Road, was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. To use the currency you first need to download a &quot;wallet&quot;, which allows to you transfer payments to others using your computer or smartphone. Recently, however, the currency has been making news as its value increases and it is being rapidly adopted by mainstream businesses. This week a coffee shop in Vancouver unveiled the first bitcoin ATM, allowing customers to exchange the virtual money for cash almost instantly. Craig and Bingham began their adventure this July, when they set out to see if it was possible to survive solely on the virtual currency. After proving they could live on bitcoin at home in Provo, Utah, they embarked on a trip that has taken them across America, through Europe and finally into Asia. Originally a 90-day challenge, they extended it to 100 in order to incorporate more travel abroad. Speaking from their Singapore hotel on the final day of the challenge, the couple describe their experience as a case of &quot;feast and famine.&quot; &quot;When we first arrived in Stockholm, we were exhausted from our flight and just went to sleep,&quot; says Craig. &quot;We woke up really hungry but couldn&apos;t find anywhere to accept bitcoin. We ended up having to wait until the hotel breakfast the next day.&quot; But although it hasn&apos;t been easy, the couple, who are making a documentary about the project, have been surprised at the willingness of so many individuals to agree to accept Bitcoin for the first time. &quot;Today we were walking through a market for the Divali festival and a woman asked me if I wanted a hennah tattoo,&quot; says Bingham. &quot;I really did. So I sat down and said to her, look I really want this but this is the situation. She was quite heistant at first but we offered to pay a bit extra and she said OK. She had a smartphone so we were able to set her up and do the payment right away.&quot;     The bitcoin logo hangs in the window of restaurant Room 77 in Berlin's Kreuzberg neighbourhood. Photograph: Alamy    While in Berlin, Craig and Bingham visited the Kreuzberg neighbourhood, which currently boasts the highest density of business that accept bitcoin in the world. &quot;We sat down in a restaurant and asked before the meal if they accepted bitcoin,&quot; says Bingham. &quot;And they said yes so nonchalantly. It was such a change from the usual battle we&apos;d got used to having. But in Singapore it&apos;s been hard because we&apos;re in a city with amazing food and there are only three restaurants we can eat in.&quot; It is unlikely that Craig and Bingham&apos;s journey would have been possible without the help of online travel agency Simply Travel. In mid-September the site became one of the first of its kind to accept bitcoin, meaning it is now possible to make reservations in over 300,000 hotels worldwide using the currency. If contacted directly, the company will also help travellers book their flights and car rentals with bitcoin, and over the next month they plan to offer this service directly through the website. Gregor Amon, CEO for Simply Travel, had already been planning to accept bitcoin, but when he heard about Craig and Bingham&apos;s challenge he quickly decided to make it a reality, helping them book all of the travel for their trip. Since then 2-3% of Simply Travel&apos;s bookings have been made using bitcoin \u2013 about 12 bookings a day. &quot;It took us half a year from when we launched before we could accept credit cards,&quot; says Amon. &quot;But when we decided to accept bitcoins it took us half a day with a developer to set it up and then we were good to go.&quot; Compared to traditional payment methods, bitcoin is an attractive prospect for business owners like Amon. &quot;Bitcoin has no risk of credit card fraud or credit card chargebacks,&quot; he explains. &quot;This is a huge problem for the travel industry because the payments are often large.&quot; Independent hostels and hotels are also slowly beginning to accept the currency. Bitcoin is now accepted in locations as far afield as Hainan Island in the South China Sea and the town of Lanquin in the Guatemalan rainforest. Pacific Tradewinds San Francisco Backpacker Hostel offers a 10% discount on all bitcoin payments. Bitcoin remains a high-risk currency, with a volatile value \u2013 although this poses a bigger threat to those looking to invest large sums of money. And before travellers cut up their credit cards they should be aware that bitcoin does not have the same security and insurance mechanisms associated with conventional banking; if you are tricked into parting with your bitcoins by a scammer, there&apos;s no higher authority to turn to.  Craig and Bingham have found the currency quite conducive to travel. &quot;We haven&apos;t had to deal with exchanging money once and we haven&apos;t had to deal with foreign transaction fees either,&quot; says Bingham. &quot;And it&apos;s a good way to save money. You can&apos;t just run to the store every time you need something, you have to think a little more than if you&apos;re using a debit card.&quot; But to really make the most of travelling by bitcoin, you need to do some research. Looking at where existing clusters of bitcoin businesses exist led Craig and Bingham to Kreuzberg in Berlin, as well as Stockholm and Singapore where the currency is taking off. Their advice to travellers considering following in their footsteps? &quot;Do your homework,&quot; says Craig. &quot;Everywhere we&apos;ve been there&apos;s been some kind of bitcoin community. The success comes from reaching out to these communities. And they&apos;ve been reaching out to us too.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/doctor-plane-air-ill-dies-mid-flight", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines is the most prepared."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-01T20:00:00Z", "title": "Is there a doctor on the plane?", "tags": ["Air transport", "Transport", "Death and dying", "Doctors", "Life and style", "World news", "Society", "Ryanair"], "article": "It was less than an hour into Ryanair flight FR7033 when John Duffy noticed the man. Duffy, a 37-year-old IT worker, was flying home to Dublin from Faro in January this year when he got up to go to the toilet. As he walked down the aisle, he saw that a passenger a few rows in front looked unwell. &quot;He had his hands up around his neck. I was standing in the aisle waiting and had a bird&apos;s-eye view of what happened: it was as if someone pulled the plug. He just collapsed and his head hit the back of the seat. The air hostess standing next to me picked up the phone and said, &apos;We&apos;ve got a situation.&apos;\u200a&quot; Lena Pettersson was going on holiday to Tanzania last year, a 10-hour Kenya Airways flight from her native Sweden. She and her travelling companion were sitting at the back of the plane. On the far side of the same row, they noticed a man who, even before takeoff, was clearly in a bad way. &quot;He was sweating and the crew were all around him,&quot; Pettersson says. &quot;They were coming and going with water, and he was not looking well at all. We took off and five minutes after that he became worse, had cramps and a really big problem. They asked if there was a doctor on the plane, and six came forward.&quot; Shortly after that, the man collapsed. Cabin crew laid him in the aisle and the doctors continued to work on him for an hour. &quot;We were flying over Europe,&quot; Pettersson says. &quot;They could have come down anywhere. But they just went on flying. And then suddenly one of the doctors made the sign of the cross and started to pray. And I\u00a0said, &apos;Oh my God, this is not possible. It&apos;s not possible.&apos;\u200a&quot; The number of people travelling by air is rising. According to the International Air Transport Association, the volume of passengers taking commercial flights each year will reach 3.3 billion worldwide by 2014, up 30% on five years ago. Of those, roughly 800 million will fly in Europe, a quarter of them in the UK. The Federal Aviation Administration believes that by 2034, more than a billion passengers will fly per year in the US alone. So it is perhaps unsurprising that, every other week in the US, there is a news story about someone dying in the air of natural causes. (For it to make international news, there has to be some extra element, such as the pilot dying, or a fellow passenger suing the airline for compensation.) Events and behaviours considered unremarkable on the ground have extra weight in-flight, tapping into our deep, atavistic insecurities about flying and exacerbated by a simple fact: as Patrick Smith, a commercial airline pilot and author of Cockpit Confidential, puts it, &quot;People just get weird around planes.&quot; Bangor airport serves an area in Maine with a population of 35,000. It has no scheduled international flights and mainly caters to short domestic runs around the American north-east. Nonetheless, it has an international terminal with four gates, a $700,000 towing vehicle capable of moving the Airbus A380 superjet \u2013 the world&apos;s largest passenger plane \u2013 and immigration officials permanently on stand-by. After flights leave the coast of Ireland, it is the first port of call on the transatlantic route; in the past 10 years, it has received more than 600 diverted flights, usually because of fuel emergencies. (In strong headwinds, planes burn more fuel and may hit the coast of America with the needle on empty.) It is also a landing option for flight crews dealing with medical emergencies over the Atlantic. As Eugene Foren, the chief dispatcher at the airport, told the Wall Street Journal last year, &quot;This job is 98% boredom and 2% sheer terror.&quot;  &quot;You have to think of the flying population as a virtual city. At any given moment, there are around 600,000 people flying. If you keep that city flying for 12 hours, some people will die.&quot;  A few months ago, Tobias Morter was doing the drinks service on a transatlantic flight out of London. At 19, he is the youngest member of staff on a British carrier that transports millions of passengers around the world each year. A passenger got up from his seat and Morter leaned back to let him pass. &quot;As I was moving, he fell on the floor. He was having a fit. It was a good job it happened out there and not in the loo.&quot; A call was put out for a\u00a0doctor on board. (&quot;You have to say &apos;doctor of medicine&apos;,&quot; Morter says, &quot;or else you get all sorts of people coming up.&quot;) As flight crew performed chest compressions and someone ran for the defibrillator, a decision was made to divert to Bangor. At the same time, from the flight deck, a call was put in to the emergency services \u2013 in this case MedAire, a company that provides 120 airlines with on-the-ground medical support. The MedAire dispatch centre is in a hospital emergency room in Phoenix, Arizona, where calls from flight decks around the world are put through to serving doctors. It is a phenomenally difficult job: to talk a flight attendant trained in first aid through a medical emergency and, based\u00a0on the information, advise the pilot whether or not to divert. As Heidi MacFarlane, vice-president of the company&apos;s strategic development, says, &quot;It&apos;s like stepping into any other treatment room in the ER, except blindfold and with their hands tied.&quot; The whole business of &quot;Is there a doctor on board?&quot; is one about which MedAire and companies like it are deeply ambivalent. Dr Paulo Alves, a cardiologist and former airline medical director who is now vice-president of aviation health for MedAire, would rather talk directly to cabin crew than to the unknown quantity of a volunteer. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong \u2013 we&apos;re extremely grateful to volunteer medical people,&quot; he says. &quot;But a medical person on the flight is primarily another passenger. We don&apos;t know anything about his or her background training, we don&apos;t what condition they&apos;re in. Were they drinking? Did someone just wake them up? How fit they are to provide a sound medical judgment isn&apos;t known. MedAire alleviates the pressure on that volunteer.&quot; It also takes the pressure off cabin crew who, given the cost and inconvenience, may be reluctant to recommend that the plane land. (Most airlines will move heaven and earth to avoid a diversion.) Only about 2% of MedAire&apos;s emergency calls result in diversions and a fraction\u00a0of that number in the death of a passenger. &quot;You have to think of the flying population as a virtual city,&quot; Alves says. &quot;So at any given moment, there are around 600,000 people flying. If you keep that city flying for 12 hours, some people will die.&quot;  &quot;The biggest problem when a passenger dies is where to put them. On a full flight, there isn&apos;t space. There were a couple of times when people were placed in a lavatory, rigor mortis set in and they couldn&apos;t get them out.&quot;  In his 20 years in the business, Richard Havers had mercifully few onboard medical emergencies and just one in-flight passenger death \u2013 on a\u00a0Continental Airlines flight from Gatwick to Houston, diverting to Bangor, by which time the passenger was already dead. Havers, the author of Airline Confidential, was Continental&apos;s vice-president for Europe and well versed in the kinds of hair-raising stories that circulate around\u00a0the industry. &quot;The biggest problem,&quot; he says, &quot;and this is slightly disturbing, is that when a passenger dies, it&apos;s a question of where to put them on the aircraft. They have to find a quiet place, but on a full flight, there isn&apos;t space.\u00a0That\u00a0creates a problem. And there were a couple of times when people were placed in a lavatory, rigor mortis set in and they couldn&apos;t get\u00a0them out.&quot; &quot;Unfortunately, most flights are full,&quot; says Heather Poole, a flight attendant for a major US\u00a0carrier and author of Cruising Attitude, an account of her experiences in the air. &quot;So it&apos;s not\u00a0always possible to move an incapacitated passenger to an empty row of seats. Singapore Airlines is the most prepared. Some of their\u00a0planes feature a &apos;corpse cupboard&apos;, a\u00a0compartment for storing a dead body if the situation arises.&quot; Kenya Airways does not have this provision, as Pettersson discovered first-hand on her flight to Dar es Salaam. After cabin crew asked passengers sitting in the middle of her row to move, they put a blanket over the dead man&apos;s head and laid his body across three seats. &quot;But he was quite a tall man,&quot; Pettersson says, &quot;so his feet were sticking out into the aisle, pretty close to me. I asked if maybe I could move. And they said, no, there were no other seats.&quot; She travelled like this for nine hours. &quot;I\u00a0felt very, very sorry for this man.&quot; But she also felt uncomfortable sitting next to a corpse, and was ultimately given a refund. (Kenya Airways never revealed the man&apos;s identity or cause of death, but when Pettersson spoke to one of the doctors who had tried to save him, &quot;she thought he was probably a drug addict or dealer and had swallowed something in a plastic bag that had broken inside his stomach. That was her theory.&quot;) Like train drivers traumatised when someone throws themselves on to the tracks, cabin crew can be damaged by these kinds of onboard emergencies. At Morter&apos;s airline, staff are offered four or five counselling sessions, although he says there&apos;s a general lack of empathy from management. This is best illustrated by the number of people turning up on the manifest with a &quot;conditions of carriage&quot; note beside their name. Effectively an airline-issued asbo, this should ban them from flying for non-medical reasons \u2013 but there they are, in the air again. When a passenger falls ill, Morter says, the biggest problem is usually their family. &quot;If the family is hysterical, they&apos;re the ones you need to control more than anyone else.&quot; After mechanical or security problems, the biggest challenge is managing potential passenger panic. Someone dying on board shouldn&apos;t rattle passengers elsewhere on the plane; it&apos;s not contagious. But one feels more vulnerable in-flight, strapped in and with nowhere to go.  &quot;We took off out of New York and had to come back because a passenger was sick, and we ended up having to jettison I don&apos;t know how many thousands of pounds of fuel, because we couldn&apos;t land overweight.  Patrick Smith, who has been flying commercial passenger planes for 20 years, takes a dim view of some passenger psychology. &quot;Some people are legitimately ill and it&apos;s a serious concern,&quot; he says, &quot;but sometimes I think passengers who are ill don&apos;t always realise what a big deal it is to divert a plane, especially on an international flight. It&apos;s not like a bus, where you can just pull over and drop the person off. It can wind up costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.&quot; Is it alarming for a pilot, to have to divert? &quot;Yeah, it&apos;s a lot of work. The worst-case scenario is you&apos;re over the polar region somewhere, or in the middle of the ocean, and have to divert to one of your pre-planned diversion airports. The logistics are challenging.&quot; All long-haul flights have divert airports written into the flight plan, but depending on how far into the flight the emergency happens, pilots can have a tough time landing. &quot;Sometimes a divert entails jettisoning fuel, which is extremely expensive and time-consuming,&quot; Smith says. &quot;I had a case about six months ago where we took off out of New York and had to come back because a passenger was sick, and we ended up having to jettison I don&apos;t know how many thousands of pounds of fuel, because we couldn&apos;t land overweight. That took the better part of an hour. Then that became a\u00a0maintenance issue and the plane had to undergo an inspection before it could fly again. All because one person decided he wanted to get off.&quot; Of course, without knowing it, most of us have\u00a0flown on planes with dead bodies, which are\u00a0being repatriated, in the hold. (Pilots, Smith says, are generally informed only if it&apos;s a VIP.) Passengers who die in-flight, meanwhile, are not\u00a0technically dead until pronounced so by a\u00a0doctor or coroner: &quot;So no one ever actually dies on an aircraft,&quot; says Havers, who avoided the topic in Airline Confidential; it was intended for\u00a0in-flight reading and he didn&apos;t want to unnerve\u00a0his\u00a0readers. Soothing nervous flyers is something airlines have approached in varying ways over the years. When Havers started out in the airline industry in 1969, on a defunct carrier called British United Airways, cabin crew in the UK were exclusively hired from debutante circles. Havers laughs. &quot;And when airlines first started \u2013 this may be apocryphal, but I don&apos;t think it is \u2013 most of the people they employed as stewards were actually nurses.&quot; Even today, with low-cost carriers undermining the mystique of air travel, there is still something vaguely magical about flight crew, these people to whom one looks for reassurance in the event of\u00a0scary turbulence. Post-9/11, they are trained to be cautious even in the face of a medical emergency. &quot;You want to be there for that passenger, but you never know if it&apos;s a decoy,&quot; Morter says. &quot;There might be a passenger pretending to have a fit and someone trying to get\u00a0into the flight deck at the same time.&quot; Or, Poole says, it may be the case that the passenger has merely taken a sleeping pill and passed out. (&quot;I&apos;ll never forget that lady. We checked for breathing. Checked for a pulse. Cleared a row of passengers and were just about to get her body flat on the ground when she came to. Turned out she&apos;d taken a sleeping pill. That&apos;s why we prefer passengers to take them after we&apos;ve pushed away from the gate and we&apos;re up in the air, in case there&apos;s a delay and we have to disembark. Flight attendants can do a lot of things, but there&apos;s no way we&apos;re going to be able to drag half a plane full of disoriented wet noodles by the ankles off the plane.&quot;)  On long-haul flights, one of the most common emergency calls relates to what looks like gastroenteritis: it could be a bug, food poisoning, or the prelude to a heart attack  For the doctors at MedAire, the most common emergencies are often the trickiest. Fainting is particularly difficult to deal with remotely, MacFarlane says, &quot;because it looks as if the person is dying. As soon as someone loses consciousness, it goes to a different level in everyone&apos;s mind. It looks really bad. Same thing with seizures. It presents very poorly.&quot; On long-haul flights, one of the most common emergency calls relates to what looks like gastroenteritis. This, too, is difficult to diagnose from the ground: it could be a bug, food poisoning, or the prelude to a heart attack. The usual rules of medical practice are inverted: on the ground, treat the cause, not the symptom; in-flight, treat the symptom just to buy enough time to get the sufferer safely to the ground. Once the aircraft landed in Bangor, the man who fell ill on Morter&apos;s flight recovered. (One of the services offered by MedAire is dealing with the bureaucratic headache on the ground prior to a diverted plane landing. &quot;You come with an ill person, and they need to be cleared by drug enforcement, or the health authorities,&quot; Alves says. Or immigration, all of which can impede a\u00a0passenger&apos;s progress to hospital.) Last January, as the Ryanair plane flew over the south coast of Britain, John Duffy helped the crew lift and carry the sick man up the aisle to the front, where he was laid on the floor. Passengers were told the plane would be diverting to Bristol. A short while later, they were told that, actually, it was going on to Dublin as planned. &quot;It was clear that he was dead,&quot; Duffy says. &quot;His face was completely purple. And the doctors had tried CPR. He was on the floor, still at the front of the plane. The doctor who was two rows in front of me said, &apos;He&apos;ll be tended to when he gets into Dublin.&apos; He obviously didn&apos;t want passengers to hear there was a dead body on board.&quot; After landing in Dublin, passengers were asked to exit through the rear of the aircraft. The\u00a0man&apos;s wife, Duffy says, was in a state of shock, but there were no hysterics. While they were still trying to save her husband&apos;s life, the doctor had come over and whispered something inaudible in her ear, to which Duffy had heard her reply, with dreadful quietude and in echo of the flight attendant&apos;s general consolation: &quot;These things happen.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/nov/02/sea-dogs-lou-reed-yorkshire-parkin", "sentences": ["One of the greatest prides of his career was that one of his radar designs was stationed in Singapore in the second world war to detect enemy ships for the Royal Navy."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-02T07:30:06Z", "title": "Family life: Last of the sea dogs, Lou Reed and Auntie's Yorkshire parkin", "tags": ["Family", "Life and style", "Culture", "Music", "Food & drink"], "article": "Snapshot: The last of the family sea dogs Sifting through an envelope labelled family, I found this photo. I was immediately struck by the man on the left \u2013 he reminded me of Captain Birdseye in the old TV adverts. On the back, my father has written, Ayr circa 1918/1920? Frederick (?) Timbury at 90+, Henry Thomas Timbury. Henry was my great-grandpa and I have a vague recollection that Frederick was my great-great-grandpa. Looking at this photo, though, brings back many happy memories of my own Grandpa Timbury of whom I was particularly fond; Montague Charles Timbury, known as Mont, son of Henry. I still smile to myself remembering, as a wee girl, how I thought it was very clever to call Grandpa &quot;Polo Mont&quot; and giggled and squealed with delight as he laughed along with me. My father, Gerald, told me that Grandpa&apos;s love of making model ships was a result of his disappointment at not being accepted for the Royal Navy, like most of his predecessors, because of his childhood asthma or &quot;weak chest&quot;. The model ships became his way of maintaining a connection with the navy. A man who was very neat, tidy and hyper-organised (rather like me!), making models \u2013 including a replica of the Cutty Sark in a bottle \u2013 played to his strengths of exactitude and attention to detail. Starting out as a boy apprentice in the Glasgow optical engineering firm Barr and Stroud, Grandpa eventually became managing director. One of the greatest prides of his career was that one of his radar designs was stationed in Singapore in the second world war to detect enemy ships for the Royal Navy. My own father broke with the nautical tradition and became a consultant psychiatrist, but he too loved boats. Together we went fishing and sailing while he, upholding Timbury tradition, puffed on his pipe. Along with the naval heritage, there is a long history of only children through the Timbury generations, and I feel sad that, having no other Timbury relatives nor children of my own, this family of seamen will end after my passing. How special, therefore, to have this old photograph and mark its significance with this story.

My father is a professor of immunology. But it was he who introduced me to the records that first shaped me. I was five when my parents separated, after which my father moved into flatshares with a handful of other twenty and thirtysomethings. It was incredibly fun \u2013 I was allowed to ride a bicycle in the hallway. Play Sim City on his boxy Macintosh. Hang self-made anti-George Bush Sr posters in the hallway. I also got to run my fingers through his record collection. If I washed and dried my hands first and was supervised, that is. Lou Reed&apos;s Transformer and the Beatles&apos; White Album both got me, immediately. Nothing made me giggle as much as my father replying to my early morning requests with a rendition of I&apos;m So Tired. The lyrics of Transformer were too mature for me, but I learned that Holly went from a he to a she and someone was bold with Harry, Mark and John. New York Telephone Conversation was the track my dad found particularly funny. He&apos;d sing it to me \u2013 he doesn&apos;t sing often \u2013 in a nursery-rhyme manner. It was funny because he would act out the voices (&quot;Did you see what she did to him / did you hear what they said?&quot;) and it was poignant because I only saw him every second weekend (&quot;I am calling, yes I am calling just to speak to you / For I know this night will kill me if I can&apos;t be with you&quot;).

The shipment, worth $100,000 (\u00a361,500), was sold by a foreign subsidiary of Survitec Group in Southampton three weeks before Maldives police provoked international condemnation by preventing voting in a rerun of the presidential elections last month. The UK government told the Guardian that it would have blocked the entire shipment if it had come from the UK, since it risked fuelling further political instability and internal repression in the Maldives, where the police are notorious for suppressing opposition parties. Last week, the UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, and the Foreign Office condemned the intervention in the elections by the police and by the Maldives supreme court, because there are strong suspicions they are trying to prevent former president Mohamed Nasheed from winning a second term in office. Nasheed, a reformist and liberal, was ousted from power in January 2012 in an alleged coup supported by the police. In early September, Nasheed won 45% in the first round of voting, sparking allegations of vote-rigging from his opponents, which were upheld by the supreme court. The Survitec consignment was shipped to the Maldives by the Brazilian arms supplier Condor Industries at a cost of $41,500. It was dated 25 September, 18 days after Nasheed took a first-round lead in the election. Alongside 250 smoke grenades and 200 stun grenades, the consignment included 900 teargas projectiles and grenades, 100 pepper spray refills 800 rubber bullets and projectiles, including 300 multiple projectile cartridges. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: &quot;The British government remains deeply concerned about the ongoing political situation in Maldives, including the reports of intimidation, violence and arrests that have taken place in recent months. &quot;We have not issued any licences for the export or trade of crowd control equipment to the Maldives in at least the last year. Under current circumstances, we would not do so.&quot; The ministry admitted that Survitec did not require a UK export licence because the shipment was sold by its Singapore-based and -registered subsidiary, WH Brennan. It was therefore outside the UK&apos;s legal jurisdiction. Amnesty International said it was horrified, adding that the case exposed a serious loophole in the UK&apos;s strict arms control legislation. Amnesty could raise the case with the House of Commons&apos; powerful committee on arms control, which combines four separate select committees, when it gives evidence for an annual review of UK arms exports on Monday. Olly Sprague, an Amnesty specialist on arms control, said: &quot;It is a serious flaw in the UK&apos;s export licensing system that weapons exported by a UK subsidiary company, despite being owned by a UK company, are not captured by UK controls, even if that equipment is subject to increased levels of UK control due to inherent risks that it could be used in serious human rights violations.&quot; Dave Hardingham, from the UK-based pressure group Friends of the Maldives, which is allied to Nasheed, said the contents of the shipment were particularly alarming because the presidential elections are due to be rerun later this week. &quot;It&apos;s a very worrying development given the MPS&apos;s [Maldives police service] record of gross human rights violations and the current political tensions,&quot; Hardingham said. &quot;It&apos;s tempting to think this consignment looks like a case of pre-emptive stockpiling by the MPS, forewarning a possible crackdown if the elections process continues in a manner not to its liking.&quot;Questions were raised last year about the role played by the Scottish Police College in training about 250 Maldives police officers, including the commissioner at the centre of the controversy, Abdulla Riyaz, in leadership, basic policing and community policing. The Maldives police service did not respond to questions about the shipment and the allegations from civil rights groups. Survitec Group, better known for selling survival equipment, boats and safety gear to offshore industries, aerospace and the military worldwide, said it had voluntarily suspended all its dealings with the Maldives following the Guardian&apos;s investigation. The company insisted that it was entirely legal for WH Brennan to supply Madlives police with the equipment because there was no arms embargo in force against the Maldives, but it would now heed the Foreign Office complaints about the political instability there. As it was sold by an overseas subsidiary, run by non-UK nationals, there was no legal requirement for it to seek a UK export licence or inform the UK government about its business dealings there. WH Brennan is also listed as a supplier of electric stun weapons to the Maldives. Survitec admitted, however, it had not known about the latest Maldives deal. It said: &quot;Every one of our global offices is required to vet a potential export order against a &apos;world list&apos; of countries and organisations subject to trading embargoes. This process further confirmed, before the order was agreed, that neither the Maldives nor the Maldives police force appear on any wider international embargo list.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/nov/05/why-more-environmentalists-should-fly", "sentences": ["I\u2019m writing this on a flight from London to Singapore, en route to Jakarta.", "Postscript:\u00a0When I landed for a stopover in Singapore, I sat down to finalise this post."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-05T10:48:25Z", "title": "Why more environmentalists should fly | Brendan May", "tags": ["Travel and transport", "Environment", "Sustainable development", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Activism"], "article": "Some years ago, Prince Charles got into trouble for accepting an environment award overseas. \u2018But he flew!\u2019, they cried. Since then, from what I can tell, HRH has had to resort largely to pre-recorded video pieces or appearing as a hologram at non-British environmental summits. Mercifully, he adds as much sustainability work onto his official state visits as he can. Having seen first hand what his interventions can do to get a green cause moving (sustainable seafood, in my case) I was sufficiently irritated by the furore to write to one of the newspapers that covered the story. I argued that the Prince and others who spend most of their waking hours trying to stop business and government wrecking the planet should not just be entitled to travel the world but have an obligation to do so, building global traction for sustainability efforts. You won\u2019t stop deforestation in the tropics from a meeting room in the west country. Having spent a large part of my working life dealing with fisheries, forestry and agricultural commodities issues, it\u2019s clear to me that I couldn\u2019t have done much of it without flying. And, without a single exception, all the people I know who\u2019ve done great things in the environmental field have travelled far and wide. We don\u2019t do it for fun, it takes us away from our families, and we see far too many airports and hotel rooms. But we do it because we would achieve far less without it. That\u2019s my defence of the greens who travel on planes. But I want to go further. I wish more environmentalists would fly. In Britain we see ourselves as a hub of green innovation, the best thinking, the proud host of some of the world\u2019s most sustainable companies, and so on. Yes, we have some good retailers and some great responsible business institutions. But having spent more and more time in the developing world, particularly in Indonesia, my perspective has changed. I don\u2019t think much of the green community in England has seen the size and scale of the problems coming down the track. They may have seen pictures and slogans, and read reports and articles. But many haven\u2019t seen first-hand the changes looming from these emerging economies. I know it\u2019s fashionable to talk about \u2018brand revolutions\u2019 and \u2018consumer behaviour change\u2019. But I fear a lot of it is cloud cuckoo land. It\u2019s a reflection of how its proponents would like to live. It bears no resemblance to the reality developing as a result of the vast rising middle classes of India, China, Indonesia and other developing nations. I\u2019m writing this on a flight from London to Singapore, en route to Jakarta. It\u2019s the fifth time this year I have done this 24 hour journey. When I arrive I will survey the view from my hotel window: traffic jams, vast new construction schemes, the logos of every Western brand adorning the towers and malls. In the morning, it will be hard to get a table for breakfast, as the hotel will be full of people who have come here to do business, trade, or in my case, work on sustainability issues with NGOs and others. Lunch may take place in one of Jakarta\u2019s countless huge malls where, for some shoppers, one iPhone is not enough, they have one for work and the other for pleasure. This is the rich side of Jakarta. Elsewhere, there is poverty, exacerbated by poor land right allocation, poor governance and past corporate misdeeds. Next week three of my colleagues, all well known environmentalists, will make the same trip but they will visit the jungles of\u00a0Sumatra as well. They will see the threat to communities and wildlife, and also the solutions and positive progress being made. This knowledge will be used to help shape and articulate one of the most significant business transformations in recent history. I would argue it\u2019s worth it. When I return to England on Friday morning I\u2019ll catch up on emails and tweets, including invitations to webinars and summits about how UK companies are changing the world, why I should only shop at farmers\u2019 markets and how I can power my burglar alarm using cucumber pulp and worm poo. Well, not quite, but you know what I mean. Given the sensory overload I\u2019ll have just had, dealing with challenges of such magnitude, this can all seem provincial and irrelevant. I know it isn\u2019t entirely, but I think it all represents an incredibly unambitious and largely fruitless mindset when it comes to global environmental issues. What Britain does matters abroad to some degree: in climate diplomacy, our stance on GMOs and so on. But an awful lot of what happens strikes me as a vast waste of resources. I suspect about 75p of every pound spent on green initiatives, roundtables, conferences, rankings systems, publications and reports in Britain would be more usefully spent grappling with the emerging giants\u2019 challenges from a political and corporate perspective. Britain\u2019s environmental footprint is miniscule in comparison and it will become ever more so in relative terms as growth continues in emerging economies. When I think of localism I think about Britain as a whole, which is viewed in Asia and elsewhere as a small, albeit significant part of the European Union. But without the EU, it is insignificant on the world stage. The way we bang on about green issues you would think we were a global power house. We aren\u2019t. I\u2019m not the only person who believes the focus of work in the next 20 years will be far away from Europe, in China, India, and Brazil. The UK market for green is saturated, and overstuffed with thinkers and practitioners. Local issues are important of course, but I think the green community in Britain risks losing its global perspective if it doesn\u2019t travel a bit more. All the debates about HS2, Gatwick vs Boris Island, fracking and the like feel very significant when in Britain. From the vantage point of Asia or the United States, they become peripheral. If you don\u2019t believe me, get on a plane. If those with the power and skills to change the world don\u2019t travel round it with a sense of urgency, there\u2019ll be little left to talk about. The big challenges aren\u2019t on Britain\u2019s railway infrastructure, they\u2019re in the cocoa plantations, mine shafts, oceans, and the tropical rainforests of the rapidly developing world. Postscript:\u00a0When I landed for a stopover in Singapore, I sat down to finalise this post. I got chatting to a man who turned out to be an oil field worker from Pekanbaru in Riau Province, Sumatra, which I visited in May. He wasn\u2019t on his way back there though, he was taking his wife and seven month old son to Los Angeles on holiday. What was he most looking forward to, I asked? \u2018I\u2019m going to Vegas as well!\u2019 came the reply. It was a useful snapshot of reality. And even if we\u2019d be right to stop him, we couldn\u2019t. It may be the green movement that needs the \u2018behaviour change\u2019 if it\u2019s to be anything other than a quaint parish talking shop. \u2022\u00a0Brendan May is chairman ofThe Robertsbridge Group.

The activists hijacked the Twitter hashtag for the World Travel Market, #WTM13, being held this week at the Excel conference centre in east London, posting pictures of alleged Maldives police brutality and criticising one of the country&apos;s most powerful hoteliers. One travel website, 101holidays.co.uk, said the official hashtag was &quot;bombarded by tweets&quot; using the trade fair&apos;s hashtag on Monday, amid mounting tensions surrounding the country&apos;s abortive presidential elections. It reported: &quot;Throughout Monday, Twitter users posted photographs of alleged police brutality connected with last year&apos;s coup in the Maldives which led to the exit of President Mohamed Nasheed. &quot;For much of the day about half the Tweets using the official hashtag were from Maldives protesters.&quot; Maldivian protesters are risking arrest and imprisonment for demanding a worldwide boycott of the country&apos;s economically crucial resorts: the Maldives parliament passed a new law last week making it a criminal offence to press for a tourism boycott or to support one. Some tweets protested about significant disparities in wealth. Some said the Maldives tourism industry earns $3bn a year, but 40% of the 320,000 population live on less than $1 a day, while poorly-paid migrant workers are widely used as resort staff. Dr Farah Faizal, the former Maldives high commissioner to the UK and a supporter of the ousted former president, said: &quot;I don&apos;t believe this is an organised call for a tourism boycott. This is a simple plea for democracy by mainly young people using social media. &quot;Why shouldn&apos;t they campaign to let the world&apos;s travel industry know just how fragile democracy is in the country?&quot; Their protests came after the Guardian revealed on Sunday that Maldives police had bought nearly $100,000 worth of teargas grenades and projectiles, pepper spray, rubber bullets and stun grenades late in September, from a UK-owned company in Singapore. The shipment came just as the islands faced a fresh political crisis over alleged attempts to thwart the re-election of Nasheed. The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it would have banned the shipment if it had originated from the UK, indicating it feared there were clear risks the weapons could fuel greater political instability and violence. Nasheed, who was forcibly ousted from power in January 2012 by Maldives police amid allegations of a coup, took 45% of the votes in the first round of the elections on 7 September. But the Maldives supreme court declared the result invalid after Nasheed&apos;s two opponents, including the wealthy hotelier and former finance minister Qasim Ibrahim, alleged there had been voting irregularities. On 7 October Maldives police prevented the islands&apos; election commission from rerunning the first round of the elections, provoking angry criticism from the UK foreign secretary, William Hague, the UN human rights commissioner, Navi Pillay, and other civil rights agencies. Pillay said the original voting on 7 September had been declared fair and free by international observers. The elections are due to be restaged this Saturday, only 48 hours before a deadline on electing a new president imposed by the Maldives constitution. The crisis is causing significant anxieties in the runup to the next Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, which starts next week. The Commonwealth secretary general, Kamalesh Sharma, has sent his predecessor, Sir Donald McKinnon, to the Maldives this week as an official envoy to monitor the elections process. Following the Guardian investigation the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the UK government was deeply concerned about the crisis and said the UK&apos;s high commissioner to the Maldives was already in the capital, Male, to press for stable and fair elections. &quot;We are concerned that further delays will serve to create greater uncertainty, further instability and damage the Maldives economy and international reputation,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;As the foreign secretary and [foreign minister] Hugo Swire have stated, we will continue to urge all parties to respect democratic values and to ensure free, fair, inclusive and peaceful elections are able to go ahead at an early date.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/05/apple-transparency-report-government-data-requests", "sentences": ["The US registered 3,542 requests, ahead of Germany, with 2,156 and Singapore, with 1,498."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T00:50:35Z", "title": "US government tops Apple's list of global user data requests", "tags": ["Apple", "US news", "Privacy", "Technology", "Obama administration", "Facebook", "Google", "Surveillance", "Data protection"], "article": "Apple has published its first report revealing the number and type of requests for information about users and devices from governments around the world, showing the US dominating the requests. The report (pdf),\u00a0published on the company&apos;s website on Tuesday, complained about US restrictions on what it could reveal and promised customers that Apple did its best to protect personal data. &quot;We have no interest in amassing personal information about our customers,&quot; the company said. &quot;We protect personal conversations by providing end-to-end encryption over iMessage and FaceTime. We do not store location data, Maps searches, or Siri requests in any identifiable form.&quot; Of 31 countries listed, the US outweighed all other governments combined in seeking information about more than 2,000 accounts, followed by Britain with 141, Spain with 104 and Germany with 93. Canada, China and Norway each made six requests. Apple complained that US restrictions prevented it from disclosing the precise number of national security orders and number of accounts affected by such orders. Figures for the US were given within ranges of 1,000. It said:\u00a0&quot;We strongly oppose this gag order, and Apple has made the case for relief from these restrictions in meetings and discussions with the White House, the US attorney general, congressional leaders and the courts.\u201d The Cupertino-based technology giant said it would continue pushing for the right to disclose information which satisfied customers&apos; right to know how often and under what circumstances the company supplied data to law enforcement agencies. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based transparency advocacy group, welcomed the report as evidence technology giants were responding to calls for greater accountability.\u00a0\u201cIt&apos;s a good sign that transparency reports are becoming the industry standard,\u201d said Nate Cardozo, the group&apos;s staff attorney. The fact it came from Apple, famous for Kremlin-style opaqueness, made it even more welcome, he said. \u201cIt&apos;s an excellent first step towards Apple becoming more transparent to their customers.\u201d Apple recently joined Facebook, Google and other tech companies in demanding substantial reforms to US government surveillance programmes following NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden&apos;s revelation that the National Security Administration was tapping their communication links. Tuesday&apos;s report made a thinly veiled reference to its rivals, noting Apple&apos;s business model &quot;does not depend on collecting personal data\u201d. Cardozo said the report set an important precedent in explicitly stating it had never received an order under section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, a wide-ranging, controversial provision which usually compels silence from companies about being probed for information. If subsequent reports made no mention of section 215 requests, it could be assumed such requests had in fact been made, acting as a silent alarm \u201ccanary\u201d, said Cardozo. \u201cThis is extremely important. No other company has done this.\u201d Apple vowed to challenge such an order if one was served. The EFF attorney also commended Apple for not automatically complying with government information requests. According to the report, Apple supplied data in response to 37% of British government account requests. It supplied data to 22% of Spanish requests, and just 6% of German requests. The lack of precise numbers for US requests meant no percentage could be given. In addition to dominating requests for account information the US also led the field in device information requests, which often come from law enforcers investigating theft. The US registered 3,542 requests, ahead of Germany, with 2,156 and Singapore, with 1,498. \u2022 This story was amended on 8 November to correct the name of the Electronic Frontier Foundation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2013/nov/06/tomorrows-tube-london-northern-line-demand-management", "sentences": ["But any attraction of, say, offering free travel before 7:00 a.m. had to be weighed against a similar experiment in Singapore where, it seems, everyone simply crushed into the same carriage space a bit earlier than usual, their discomfort swelled by new rail transit travellers deserting buses in order to take advantage of the bargain."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T06:30:00Z", "title": "Tomorrow's Tube: easing the Clapham squeeze", "tags": ["London politics", "Politics", "London", "Transport policy", "Transport", "London Underground", "UK news"], "article": "Lovely place, Balham, but who&apos;d want to catch a rush hour Tube from there? Problem is, a lot of people do - too many for each others&apos; comfort. And the problem neither starts nor ends there. The stretch of the Northern Line between Tooting Bec and Stockwell stations, also taking in three different kinds of Clapham - North, South and Common - is the busiest and most crowded on the entire Underground network during the morning peak.  That is why Transport for London is to launch a pilot scheme to help passengers who daily feel the Clapham Squeeze avoid the worst of it - to help themselves avoid it, to be precise. From next Monday, TfL will use whiteboard notices, in-station announcements, leaflets, posters and targeted emails to advise those who endure the south end of the Northern at its most tightly rammed about possible ways to find relief.  Sharing information is, it is stressed, the guiding concept here, as opposed to telling people what to do. The approach is as follows: it might be that you didn&apos;t know that starting your journey as little as 15 minutes earlier or later than usual could make a pleasant difference to the quality of your journey; it might even be that you could take a different route; not everyone has that flexibility in their schedule; not everyone wants to use it; your service; your choice.  The pilot will be the small start of a much larger programme of travel demand management (TDM) on the Tube, to be rolled over the coming months. Near the end of this year or at the beginning of next TfL will go a bit more multi-media, including publishing a list of prime hot spots for busy-ness all supported by a revamped website (there&apos;s a link on the present site to the evolving new version). A quid says Victoria, London Bridge and Holborn will play starring roles.  You&apos;ll have guessed that much of this is an effort to apply what was learned during the Olympics to the everyday London Underground experience. Warning the travelling public about high-congestion locations and times was a highly visible feature of Games Time.  There was, I am told, some advance anxiety within TfL about the possible effects of its &quot;get ahead of the games&quot; strategy. Would it provoke something verging on panic, simply creating new pinch points elsewhere? That this didn&apos;t happen underlined the importance of pitching customer communications just right .  Some consideration has been given by TfL to using price incentives to dilute local concentrations of peak time Tube use as additions to the present, differing peak and off peak fares. But any attraction of, say, offering free travel before 7:00 a.m. had to be weighed against a similar experiment in Singapore where, it seems, everyone simply crushed into the same carriage space a bit earlier than usual, their discomfort swelled by new rail transit travellers deserting buses in order to take advantage of the bargain. In any case, says TfL, its research suggests that the best incentive to change habits is the prospect of a more comfortable journey.  The use of TDM is, of course, just one ingredient in a vast recipe of measures that will need to be followed if the Tube as we know it, the Crossrail work-in-progress and its mooted successors - not to mention the rest of London&apos;s transport network - are to accommodate the fast-growing numbers of people wanting to use them. But even as the longer-term infrastructure and upgrade graft goes on, including new signalling on the Northern Line itself to enable more trains to run, existing capacity needs to be made the best possible use of. TfL pledges to do all it can to assist us with assisting its pursuit of that goal.  If you haven&apos;t felt the Clapham Squeeze yourself, it basically means that by the time trains leaving the Northern Line&apos;s southern terminus of Morden have passed through South Wimbledon, Colliers Wood and Tooting Broadway the carriages are packed and people are left standing on platforms, increasingly anxious that there won&apos;t be room for them on the next train either. That sardine sensation is at its most intense, TfL says, from 8:00 to 8:30 at Tooting Bec, from 8:15 to 08:30 in Balham and from 8:30 to 8:45 in the Clapham trinity itself. Make your small but important adjustments accordingly.  This form of morning torment in not unique to residents of Wandsworth and thereabouts. At Bethnal Green, I&apos;m told, a small but significant number of savvy westbound punters avoid having to, quite literally, queue for a space on a Central Line train (been there, done that) by first catching one eastbound to Mile End, Stratford or, who knows, far beyond, then crossing the platform. &quot;Tactical commuting,&quot; is how one TfL sage wryly described this. There are other words that could be used. This is one of a series of articles about the future of the London Underground service. The first one is here. Your comments and your suggestions for other pieces are very welcome.

He was one of the UK&apos;s greatest engineers, revolutionising transport and engineering. He was responsible for the building of the Great Western Railway \u2013 152 miles from London to Bridgewater that took six years to build. Many engineering problems had to be solved and spectacular bridges created, that are still used by trains today. Brunel also found time to design the suspension bridge over the Avon gorge at Bristol and create the first iron steam ship. We continue to benefit hugely from Brunel&apos;s work and vision, even if his projects tended to over-run in time and cost and occasionally didn&apos;t work out as intended. So, what might Brunel think of the debate about HS2? If things go to plan, it will reach Manchester by 2031 \u2013 just 200 miles in 18 years. Compare this with the high-speed railway between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore (250 miles in 90 minutes) recently approved by the Malaysian government for completion by 2020. Singapore&apos;s infrastructure investment is 30 times per head of population more than that of the UK. It is not as if Singapore does not already have a very good transport infrastructure compared with the UK&apos;s; rather, Singapore is investing to become a leading global business hub, which will be at the expense of the West. Even more impressive is Johannesburg, South Africa, where the road network is better than we have around any UK cities. Public transport is not being neglected, as evidenced by bus lanes from Soweto to the centre of Johannesburg, with bus stops between the carriageways designed like small futuristic railway stations. It is difficult to compare infrastructure investment between countries as costs vary hugely, but a 2012 document by the South African treasury argued that developing countries needed to invest 25% of their GDP in infrastructure to generate economic growth. That appears to be what South Africa is aiming to do. Dubai invests 17.5% of its GDP in infrastructure. By comparison, the UK government announced in June that \u00a370bn would be invested in transport infrastructure by 2020. That works out at less than 1% of the UK&apos;s GDP. The UK has not adjusted to the modern world. Expanding air capacity in south east England has been debated for decades and Heathrow is at 99% of capacity \u2013 a gift to the city of Frankfurt, which is seeking to attract business from London. Pointless arguments are taking place about the cost of HS2 and the economic benefits when none of us can forecast 18 years ahead. Successive UK governments have spent several decades debating whether to build a decent road between Sheffield and Manchester, two of our major cities, only 40 miles apart. If it was Dubai, we would have a highway with six lanes either side instead of long traffic queues polluting our villages. Brunel would not have been able to operate in today&apos;s UK. A dramatic change in government spending priorities and delivery of major infrastructure projects will be needed to prevent the UK talking itself imperceptibly into third world status.

It is a significant opportunity for transatlantic trade, no doubt. Critics, meanwhile, are blaming the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership for the failures of rightwing European governments and the powers they are willing to cede to multinational corporations. The anger is right but the target is wrong: we need to look far more closely at the UK coalition government&apos;s priorities before laying the blame at the door of &quot;Brussels&quot;. It is expected (as George Monbiot has pointed out) that the European commission will seek to include in the deal a mechanism known as the investor-state dispute settlement. This clause is intended to protect foreign investors from discrimination by governments. In practice it means that companies will have the right to sue foreign governments if they don&apos;t like the local legislation. The cases are heard in private. Governments often lose. Millions of pounds, dollars and euros have been paid to private companies when a secret panel of arbitrators decides the government has overstepped the mark by legislating, say, to make generic drugs more widely available or to stop tobacco companies aggressively marketing to children. The mechanism is a scandal. The European commission has a lot to answer for, and those of us shouting the loudest in Brussels against it will keep shouting. But the buck does not stop with the commission, and it is not an invention of the US trade deal. Investor-state mechanisms have existed in investment agreements for years. We already have them in UK agreements with non-EU countries. They have been pencilled into EU trade agreements with Canada and Singapore. The EU now has legal powers in the area of investment policy, and member governments are in the process of establishing one clear set of rules to replace the existing spaghetti bowl of criss-crossing agreements. It is the perfect opportunity to abandon the investor-state mechanism. Alas, governments, including the UK, issued the European commission with a negotiating mandate that includes the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism. The commission is pursuing their request with vigour. And now, don&apos;t the missing pieces of the UK coalition&apos;s debacle over plain cigarette packaging fall into place? The Australian government was sued by Philip Morris when it attempted to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes and has since decided to scrap the investor-state dispute mechanism because of its effect on the government&apos;s ability to legislate on health and environment. Meanwhile, in the UK David Cameron&apos;s enthusiasm for plain packaging stopped dead in its tracks and the legislation was put on hold because of &quot;considerable legal uncertainty&quot;. The fact that the government was willing to sacrifice a key health proposal because of fears that big tobacco would sue is bad enough. The fact that Cameron failed to scrap the investor-state provision in UK investment agreements is worse, and the fact that his government demanded the European commission actually include it in new EU agreements with Canada, Singapore and the US is shameful. But no doubt the Tories would be happy to sit back and let &quot;Brussels&quot; take the blame for this one. Labour MEPs and our sister parties in the Socialist and Democrat group in the European parliament continue to vote to scrap this mechanism, but we face an uphill battle in a parliament dominated by conservatives and a minority of MEPs who do not even turn up to vote. Alongside the investment agreements themselves the parliament and council are currently negotiating legislation for the practical implementation of the investor-state dispute settlement. As the lead MEP for the Socialists and Democrats on this legislation I am drafting clauses to ensure that, if investor-state cannot be stopped, there will at least be legal requirements for transparency. As a minimum it should be made public if foreign companies are suing the EU. We should know what the companies are suing for and how much taxpayers&apos; money is at stake. We must also be able to ringfence legislation for public health, the environment and workers&apos; rights to ensure companies cannot challenge them. Meanwhile, no EU investment agreements have been concluded, but time is rapidly running out. The answer is not to derail the US trade agreement but look to the almost-concluded agreements with Singapore and Canada and urge the UK government and MEPs to pressure the commission to change tactics. The Tories give us a lot of hot air about &quot;standing up to Brussels&quot;, but on standing up to corporate power?

The agreement announced on Wednesday underscores the UK&apos;s dependency on imported fuel as North Sea supplies run out more rapidly than predicted. Centrica signed a deal with Qatar&apos;s national gas company, Qatargas, to import 3m tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas (LNG) \u2013 enough to supply 13% of domestic gas use, or about 3m households \u2013 from now to the end of 2018. The company will pay about \u00a34.4bn for the fuel. The fuel, which will be delivered by tanker to the north Kent coast, comes amid growing global competition for liquefied natural gas, with prices in Asia significantly higher than those in Europe. In the US, meanwhile, gas prices are at historic lows, as an over-production of shale gas has led to rock bottom prices. The role of gas in global energy supplies, and the effects on greenhouse gas emissions, are expected to form a large part of the annual global analysis, entitled World Energy Outlook, which will be published on Thursday by the International Energy Agency. Centrica&apos;s deal extends an earlier agreement, of February 2011, between it and Qatar, one of the most gas-rich regions on Earth. More than half of the supplies agreed under that deal had already been delivered, the company said, so there was need for renewal. The deal could be seen as an indication that prices in the UK could rise further. Centrica&apos;s previous contract with Qatargas will expire in June 2014, so the securing of new supplies will have involved a calculation about gas prices in the next five years ahead. Sam Laidlaw, chief executive of Centrica, said: &quot;We are delighted that we continue to deepen our relationship with Qatargas and continue to build our LNG business by integrating our positions along the gas value chain. &quot;It is vital that the UK has a diverse range of sources of supply to meet its energy requirements. In a competitive international market, contracts like this underpin the UK&apos;s access to global LNG supplies for the benefit of customers.&quot; Michael Fallon, the energy minister, said: &quot;Long-term deals of this kind, with reliable suppliers like Qatar, are vital for our future energy security.&quot; The UK&apos;s vulnerability over imported gas was flagged up this year when technical problems with one of the main pipelines into the UK caused a temporary shutdown. The pipeline quickly reopened but the incident highlighted the fact that the UK had few gas storage facilities and frequently only a few days&apos; supply of gas to hand. Given the running down of the North Sea gas fields, the widespread dependency on the fuel for heating and for power generation, which is only set to increase, any fresh technical problems at the UK&apos;s supply pipelines could lead to renewed concerns. The government this year turned down an application for public money for a new gas storage facility. Khalid Bin Khalifa Al Thani, chief executive of Qatargas, told an energy conference in Singapore last week that the market for gas in Europe had been sluggish because of the effects of the recession. He said: &quot;The continued economic slowdown, coupled with the impact of European energy and climate-change policies and their unintended effects on the energy markets, has seriously dampened and even reversed in some cases the growth of gas consumption that was achieved in the continent during the last decade. &quot;There is no doubt that the European economies will start recovering in the near future and consequently gas consumption growth will return. While at the same time, European domestic gas production continues to decline. &quot;We are therefore hopeful that the serious loopholes and inconsistencies in energy and climate-change policies will be addressed and corrected soon to encourage long-term investment in gas infrastructure and enhance the energy security of Europe.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/07/us-spooks-russia-china-internet-authoritarian", "sentences": ["In Singapore new licensing regulations require news websites with more than 50,000 unique visitors a month to pay a deposit then comply with takedown orders within 24 hours."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-07T06:00:01Z", "title": "US spooks play into the hands of Russia, China and others who want control over global digital citizens | John Kampfner", "tags": ["Internet", "Espionage", "US news", "Russia", "China", "Technology", "NSA", "World news"], "article": "No wonder Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are smiling: they are closer than they have ever been to mastering who is saying and doing what online. They and other authoritarian leaders are watching with glee as US intelligence agencies destroy what is left of the original utopian vision of a cyberspace free of government control. The process was under way long before Edward Snowden revealed the extent of surveillance by the US National Security Agency. But the allegations of mass monitoring of hitherto friendly political leaders, businesses and ordinary internet users around the world have stoked a backlash with worrying consequences. Slowly but surely governance of the internet is moving from the existing mishmash of institutions and into the hands of national governments. The Chinese call this &quot;cyber autonomy&quot;. Authoritarian regimes are showing ever-greater confidence in restricting information, filtering, blocking, monitoring and punishing anyone who steps over the mark. During a recent visit to Beijing \u2013 attending a seminar on new media at the Central Party School \u2013 I was given a remarkable insight into official thinking. The issue is one of the most sensitive in China, going to the heart of the party&apos;s hold on power. With up to 600 million netizens \u2013 spending hours every day on the micro-blogging site Weibo and the messaging service WeChat \u2013 is it still possible to control the message? The party believes it can. The exhortations were colourful: I was told that China needed to help people &quot;show responsibility and reasonableness&quot; and to &quot;harmonise the public and private persona, to minimise public confusion&quot;. After President Xi&apos;s call to &quot;seize the ground of new media&quot;, a law was introduced in September to punish &quot;wrongful rumours&quot; online. Content that is re-posted more than 500 times or viewed more than 5,000 times could land the author in jail for up to three years. A number of well-known bloggers have since been arrested. Reports say that China has an estimated 2 million &quot;internet opinion analysts&quot; tracking content. The boundaries for acceptable and unacceptable information are subjective. It may be patriotic to report on the corruption of certain officials; to cast aspersions on others could be a crime. Chillingly, I was told that the party is looking at an &quot;explicit protocol to provide for future discipline requirements&quot;. Given the penalties, harassment and deliberate vagueness of the boundary lines, it is remarkable that so many ordinary Chinese are as outspoken as they are. They have more to fear now than ever before. In Russia, alongside the violence meted out to journalists \u2013 making it one of the most dangerous places for investigative reporters to operate \u2013 new laws instigated under the guise of child protection allow the authorities to close down sites immediately and force the big service providers to block access. Other countries have imposed their own rules to promote &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;stability&quot;. In Singapore new licensing regulations require news websites with more than 50,000 unique visitors a month to pay a deposit then comply with takedown orders within 24 hours. The credibility of the US to proselytise about individual rights online is pretty much shot. Its attempts to preserve the existing system of internet governance have been similarly undermined. Until now, a number of organisations have shared responsibility: groups with an alphabet soup of acronyms, from Icann (Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, a US-based not-for-profit organisation that assigns domains) to IGF (Internet Governance Forum, which brings together companies, civil society groups, governments and techies for an annual week of discussions on the future of the net). At the recent IGF in Indonesia the Chinese were, for the first time, out in force. One &quot;expert&quot; offered to explain to a US state department official why US human rights standards are not up to scratch and how China could help. Gatherings such as these are often cumbersome, but they have the benefit of being open to all voices \u2013 multi-stakeholder in geek jargon. All this could change. Moves are afoot to give a long- established but previously low-profile UN organisation \u2013 the International Telecommunications Union \u2013 jurisdiction over the web. The ITU is the preserve of governments alone. It is not just the Chinese and Russians who are keen on this change. India, Brazil and South Africa are among a number of emerging powers that want to prise control away from groups considered friendly to the US and towards the ITU. The most recent move, in Dubai last December, narrowly failed. Thanks to the NSA furore, it will be easier next time. Matters are likely to come to a head next April when Brazil holds a special conference focusing on securing user privacy from the prying eyes of US and other intelligence services. One idea being mooted is to require internet service providers to host data country by country, and thereby be answerable to local laws. On the one hand, this could be seen as an understandable and laudable fightback. But the Balkanisation of the net could also reinforce the control of nation states over global digital citizens. American dominance of the internet is being challenged on several fronts. The Obama administration and its spooks only have themselves to blame. It is just possible that recent events could usher in a new era of transparency and data protection. But don&apos;t bet on it. The direction of travel is more likely moving towards the authoritarians.

Since 2003, Tennis Australia has been marketing the major as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific in a bid to grow its popularity in the region and increase profitability. But as uptake of tennis in China snowballs and the nation\u2019s economic and political power swells, calls for a Grand Slam of its own are strengthening. The Grand Slam of Asia-Pacific tagline aims to keep the Australian Open relevant in a global context but a growing school of thought believes Asia has the right, not to mention the funds and facilities, to host the Asia-Pacific major. \u201cI know [The Australian Open] markets itself as the Grand Slam of the Asia-Pacific, but I don\u2019t really get the Asia part,\u201d says Michael Luevano, tournament director of the Shanghai Rolex Masters. \u201cAre you really Asia? You\u2019re Australia. You are your own entity.\u201d Commercially the stance makes perfect sense for Tennis Australia. More than half the Australian Open\u2019s global media value is now generated in Asia, and 55% of the total global broadcast audience now hails from the Asia-Pacific. While spectators from Asia still only made up 15% of the Open\u2019s total visitors in 2012, the numbers have more than doubled since 2004.\u00a0It\u2019s therefore in Australia\u2019s interest to promote the tournament in the People\u2019s Republic and support the sport\u2019s growth. As such, these efforts are intensifying. Last month Tennis Australia conducted its third annual trophy tour of Asia, showcasing Australian tennis stars and their Australian Open trophies in seven major cities in China, as well as Seoul and Singapore. \u201cThe key [goal] is to build participation. Growing the sport of tennis, increasing participation and really trying to build an Asian champion,\u201d Australian doubles legend Todd Woodbridge told The Guardian during the trophy tour\u2019s stopover in Mong Kok, Hong Kong.\u00a0\u201cObviously we want Australians to win the Australian Open, but we recognise how important it is for the tournament to be successful as well.\u201d Once a bastion of western tradition, tennis is now China\u2019s newest sporting obsession, both at amateur and professional levels. The nation\u2019s interest in the sport has been growing exponentially since tennis became an Olympic sport at the Seoul Olympics in 1988. But the biggest acceleration came when Li Na triumphed at the 2011 French Open to become the first Asian to win a Grand Slam. \u201cTo have a homegrown local really changed the whole game,\u201d says Woodbridge, who played in the era of American-born Chinese Michael Chang. \u201cIf you look at the commercial value of what Chang achieved compared to Na, it\u2019s another stratosphere.\u201d     Novak Djokovic of Serbia at the Shanghai Rolex Masters. Photograph: XI YA/EPA    While tennis currently ranks as the seventh most popular participation sport in the People\u2019s Republic, it\u2019s the number one \u201caspiration sport\u201d, according to research from The Shanghai Rolex Masters.\u00a0Aspiration is now the hallmark of China\u2019s newly affluent, swelling middle class. The long-standing tradition associated with tennis, the upstanding profiles of its super-star players, and the exceedingly large winners\u2019 purses all feed its reputation as a sport of the elite. \u201cYoung professionals, if they play a sport, are going to choose an upwardly mobile sport like tennis,\u201d said Luevano. For a population that leads the world in other racquet sports, tennis is also the natural next step. The Chinese boast the best table tennis and badminton players in the world, so it\u2019s foreseeable the country might one day be a powerhouse of top 10 tennis players, despite the fact that there is still no Chinese male in the top 50. Furthermore, tennis has fast become \u201cthe sport of the government\u201d, says Luevano. All China\u2019s key officials now play, and this support is evidenced on a grander stage by hundreds of millions of dollars worth of government investment in tennis facilities and development programs around the country. While the Chinese Tennis Association would not share its own statistics, the WTA tour estimates there are more than 30,000 tennis courts around China, almost all of which have been built in the last decade. The majority of new housing complexes in tier one and tier two cities now include tennis courts as standard, and China\u2019s state television service CCTV reports tennis is the third most watched sport, after football and basketball. Tennis was officially added to the public school system two years ago \u2013 a direct initiative to boost China\u2019s aptitude for tennis at an amateur level. But investment at a professional level has been astronomical. Shanghai\u2019s bid for the Masters Cup in 2004 was predicated by the city\u2019s pledge to building the world\u2019s foremost venue to host the event. The resulting Qizhong Stadium cost the Chinese government upwards of US$300m in infrastructure and facilities. The China Open launched in Beijing in 2004 with a similarly spectacular facility. The China National Tennis Center features 11 courts, a 15,000-seat stadium with a retractable roof, \u201cspace-age\u201d air-cooling technology according to the WTA tour and, in 2006, became the first tournament outside the United States to implement Hawk-Eye electronic line calling. Its prize money totals US$7.5 million this year - seven times the 2004 offer. Last year&apos;s event lured 270,464 spectators, which is well shy of the Australian Open\u2019s 685,00, but phenomenal growth considering the tournament has only existed for nine years. It\u2019s no great surprise then that China\u2019s tournaments are winning praise from the world\u2019s top seeds. The Shanghai Rolex Masters, for example, was voted by players as the ATP Masters 1000 Tournament of the Year in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. \u201cWe started from zero and installed a mentality of being as hospitable as a hotel,\u201d said Luevano. \u201cWe were service-oriented, and what the Chinese know how to do extremely well is host people. \u201cOur philosophy is that if you are going to make this trip to Asia you have to be made comfortable and have absolutely everything you could possibly want at the venue, and I think we\u2019ve achieved that.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt that the nation is doing everything in its power to become the centre of Asian tennis. It has even begun cannibalising surrounding tournaments. The Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, which celebrated its 30th edition this year, has been struck from the calendar to make room for what will be a fifth Chinese tournament in Wuhan in 2014. As China assumes an increasingly central place in world affairs, government and corporate funding of tennis soars, and it produces more players in the top 50, it\u2019s foreseeable the Dragon will seek to claim logical ownership of the \u2018Asia-Pacific\u2019 major.     Li Na celebrates her victory over Caroline Wozniacki at the Australian Open. Photograph: Petar Kujundzic/Reuters    Back in 2008 China\u2019s current tennis idol Li declared the January Grand Slam should be moved to Shanghai, citing better climate. Woodbridge thinks that\u2019s off the cards. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen,\u201d he told The Guardian. \u201cThe government has invested heavily in the sport and the precinct of Melbourne Park to make sure the Australian Open stays. In 2014 and 2015 we\u2019ll have three courts with roofs on them. Asia though, by 2030 they\u2019ll be putting pressure on.\u201d While Woodbridge believes it\u2019s unlikely the fourth Grand Slam will shift north, China is certainly pushing to host a fifth.\u00a0\u201cYou cannot buy into tradition, you cannot buy a Wimbledon,\u201d said Luevano. \u201cBut I think we [China] can be the fifth major, no question. Shanghai is headed in that direction to become a fifth major event.\u201d China Open tournament director Alfred Zhang also openly declared that the Beijing tournament aimed to one day become the fifth Grand Slam when it debuted in 2004.\u00a0&quot;It might be an unrealistic goal in the near future, but it should be the direction we are supposed to go,&quot; Zhang recently told the China Daily. It\u2019s possible that a Chinese Grand Slam might bolster interest in the sport more generally throughout the region, enhancing the relevance of the Australian Open.\u00a0But would the global tennis and corporate community really support two Asia-Pacific majors? A Chinese major may foreseeably wipe the gloss off, and swipe sponsorship dollars from, its competitor down under. How this situation plays out in years to come is anyone\u2019s guess. Perhaps clever marketing will succeed in differentiating the events to the extent that two regional majors can prosper. Perhaps tradition will buckle to economic brawn. One thing is certain. As China and Australia each vie to be the tennis champion of the Asia-Pacific, the geo-political game is sure to get as heated as the one on the court.\u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/09/film-festival-previews", "sentences": ["There are some fine international movies such as Laotian childhood drama The Rocket, Singapore&apos;s Cannes hit Ilo Ilo Kurdish flick My Sweet Pepperland."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-09T06:00:00Z", "title": "Bradford Animation Festival, Cinecity Brighton: film festival previews", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "article": "Bradford Animation Festival There&apos;s everything from CGI insects to lo-fi zombies on the screen at this inclusive event, which gives you features and shorts, for and by all ages, plus a dedicated gaming section.

The sport&apos;s 11 teams were already signed up to the end of 2020 so getting a commitment from the governing body paves the way for F1&apos;s long-awaited stock market flotation. Ecclestone told the Guardian: &quot;The FIA gets 1% if F1 floats but the teams don&apos;t have shares.&quot; The largest F1 shareholder, private equity firm CVC, has put a $12bn valuation on F1 but the float has been stalled by the lack of agreement from the FIA and legal hurdles. Last week Ecclestone took the stand in a high court case in which he has been accused of paying part of a $44m bribe to steer the sale of a 47.2% stake in F1 to CVC in 2006. He continues giving evidence today in the trial which has been brought by German media rights firm Constantin Medien. It claims that Ecclestone and his Bambino family trust paid $44m to Gerhard Gribkowsky, the banker who was in charge of selling the F1 stake. Constantin says the payment was to ensure that Gribkowsky sold to CVC because it had agreed to retain Ecclestone as F1&apos;s chief executive. Constantin was in line for 10% of the proceeds if the stake was sold for more than $1.1bn but iCVC only paid $814m. Constantin claims that other buyers would have paid more. Ecclestone denies the payment was a bribe. He said Gribkowsky threatened to tell Revenue &amp; Customs that he controlled Bambino if the money was not paid. Bambino is based offshore but Ecclestone is a UK resident so would be liable for tax on the estimated $4bn in the trust if he was found to be in control of it \u2013 which he strongly denies. Last week Ecclestone told the court: &quot;I was informed clearly that it was extremely serious, because if somebody at that time had contacted the Revenue and said &apos;I&apos;ve got some information that Mr Ecclestone controls the family trust&apos; they would have assessed me for something in the region of two billion and I wouldn&apos;t have been able to pay it.&quot; He added: &quot;Had I have thought it through properly, for sure I would have not paid him.&quot; Legal wrangles are not the only reason that a float of F1 has not got the green light. It was due to take place on the Singapore stock exchange in June last year but CVC halted it because of the eurozone crisis. Instead, it cut its stake in F1 by about half through selling 28.4% of the parent company, Delta Topco, to money managers BlackRock, Waddell &amp; Reed and Norges, the investment division of Norway&apos;s central bank. CVC netted $2.1bn from the sales and got a further $865m from a dividend in 2012. Its now owns a 35.5% stake in Delta Topco and Ecclestone personally holds 5.3%. He agreed to give the FIA 1% of the shares issued on flotation. Delta Topco owns the rights to F1 until 2110, having paid $313m for them in 2001. The FIA&apos;s annual fee for the rights comes to just $10m, yet they generate revenues of over $1.5bn for Delta Topco. The FIA&apos;s agreement with Ecclestone will increase its total take from F1 to $40m annually in addition to the 1% equity stake, estimated to be worth $120m. That would be a significant sum for the governing body which had just over \u20ac50m in revenue in 2011, according to the latest approved accounts. In that year it made a \u20ac2.5m loss, and is forecast to lose \u20ac2.1m for 2012 \u2013 a figures to be confirmed at its annual meeting in December. This year it increased the entry fees paid by each F1 team from $326,000 to $500,000, plus $5,000 per point or $6,000 for the championship-winning team. Red Bull Racing, which won the F1 title, has to pay $3.3m, a tenfold increase on its fee for 2012. The cost of F1 drivers&apos; licences has also accelerated from a base fee of $1,830 plus $230 per point in 2012 to $10,000 plus $1,000 per point."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/11/maid-singapore-cambodia-domestic-workers", "sentences": ["Thol Srey Mach is one of 400 women taking part in a pilot scheme that is sending Cambodian domestic workers to Singapore.", "Srey Mach, who has worked in Malaysia, can expect to earn about $360 a month in Singapore, agents say, though her salary will ultimately depend on &quot;market forces&quot;, with no guaranteed minimum wage.", "Two Cambodian agencies participating in the Singapore scheme were allegedly implicated in some of those cases.", "The Cambodian government has said it believes its workers will be better protected in Singapore.", "Although Singapore has recently mandated a weekly off-day for maids, employers are allowed to pay workers extra in lieu of a rest day if they agree.", "We want to work more so we can get more money.&quot; Cambodian workers&apos; rights advocates are appealing to Singaporeans to pay the placement fees, which other source countries, such as the Philippines, insist employers bear.", "Singaporeans complain that they already have to pay $213 a month in taxes \u2013 a &quot;maid levy&quot; \u2013 as well as a $4,030 bond to have a household worker.", "In September, the Manila-based Association of Licensed Recruitment Agencies to Singapore (Alras) stopped sending domestic workers to Singapore in protest against salary deductions and placement fees, which are illegal under Filipino law.", "Since April 2011, Singaporean law has set a two-month cap on fees that local agencies can deduct from a worker&apos;s salary.", "But despite the laws, some Singapore and Filipino agencies have continued to deduct salaries for up to eight months, said Lucy Sermonia, president of Alras, which represents 110 Filipino agencies.", "Singapore&apos;s ministry of manpower told the Guardian it had taken a &quot;firm stance against excessive recruitment fees&quot;, with heavy penalties for offenders.", "&quot;We urge [agencies] to comply with requirements imposed by source-country governments \u2026 However, Singapore is not able to enforce the laws of another country,&quot; a spokesperson said.", "Singapore&apos;s employment act, which regulates working conditions, does not cover domestic workers.", "Although workers&apos; welfare has improved over the years, placement fees have increased in the past decade, said John Gee from Transient Workers Count Too, a Singapore NGO.", "&quot;Before the Asian financial crisis it was pretty normal for Singapore employers to expect to pay for the placement costs,&quot; he said.", "Manila&apos;s tough stance has pushed up demand for domestic workers from other countries, Gee said, with Singaporean employers knowing it will be harder to get Filipino workers to forfeit their rest day.", "They won&apos;t complain and will do what they are told \u2026 There is the same image, I&apos;m afraid, with workers from Cambodia.&quot; Gary Chin, managing director at Nation Employment, an agency in Singapore, said Filipino workers&apos; share of the market had plummeted from 90% two decades ago to 20-30% today because they were &quot;too expensive&quot;.", "&quot;If [employers] want to pay less, they will turn to those countries that still allow their maids to Singapore and are [paying] the placement fees, like Burma, Indonesia and Cambodia,&quot; Chin said."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-11T07:00:00Z", "title": "Maid in Singapore: will Cambodian domestic workers be better protected? | Kevin Pooniah", "tags": ["Cambodia", "Employment", "Global development", "Singapore", "Philippines", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Human rights", "Law", "Women"], "article": "Thol Srey Mach is one of 400 women taking part in a pilot scheme that is sending Cambodian domestic workers to Singapore. There are more than 200,000 foreign domestic workers on the island, and if the trial goes well it could open the way for a new source of labour to sate the affluent city-state&apos;s appetite for household help. With that in mind, Srey Mach, 26, and dozens of other young women have been preparing by scrubbing floors, bathing plastic babies and brushing up on their English at a Cambodian recruitment centre. The alternative to going overseas for many of these women would be working in a garment factory \u2013 a job that pays about $75 (\u00a3 47) per month. Srey Mach, who has worked in Malaysia, can expect to earn about $360 a month in Singapore, agents say, though her salary will ultimately depend on &quot;market forces&quot;, with no guaranteed minimum wage. In 2011, the Cambodian government stopped sending domestic workers to Malaysia after a series of rights abuses, including confinement, beatings and sexual exploitation emerged. Two Cambodian agencies participating in the Singapore scheme were allegedly implicated in some of those cases. The Cambodian government has said it believes its workers will be better protected in Singapore. But rights groups point to large placement fees and a lack of guaranteed rest days as potential welfare issues. Although Singapore has recently mandated a weekly off-day for maids, employers are allowed to pay workers extra in lieu of a rest day if they agree. For an extra $15 a week, Srey Mach says she won&apos;t take a day off: &quot;I don&apos;t know what I would do on an off-day. We want to work more so we can get more money.&quot; Cambodian workers&apos; rights advocates are appealing to Singaporeans to pay the placement fees, which other source countries, such as the Philippines, insist employers bear. Singaporeans complain that they already have to pay $213 a month in taxes \u2013 a &quot;maid levy&quot; \u2013 as well as a $4,030 bond to have a household worker. The Cambodian women will have almost all of their salaries deducted during their first six months of work, to repay a $1,930 loan taken out to cover agency fees. If the worker returns home prematurely, she will still be tied to the loan. In September, the Manila-based Association of Licensed Recruitment Agencies to Singapore (Alras) stopped sending domestic workers to Singapore in protest against salary deductions and placement fees, which are illegal under Filipino law. Since April 2011, Singaporean law has set a two-month cap on fees that local agencies can deduct from a worker&apos;s salary. But despite the laws, some Singapore and Filipino agencies have continued to deduct salaries for up to eight months, said Lucy Sermonia, president of Alras, which represents 110 Filipino agencies. &quot;It is high time we think about the welfare of the household service workers,&quot; she said. Singapore&apos;s ministry of manpower told the Guardian it had taken a &quot;firm stance against excessive recruitment fees&quot;, with heavy penalties for offenders. &quot;We urge [agencies] to comply with requirements imposed by source-country governments \u2026 However, Singapore is not able to enforce the laws of another country,&quot; a spokesperson said. Singapore&apos;s employment act, which regulates working conditions, does not cover domestic workers. Although workers&apos; welfare has improved over the years, placement fees have increased in the past decade, said John Gee from Transient Workers Count Too, a Singapore NGO. &quot;Before the Asian financial crisis it was pretty normal for Singapore employers to expect to pay for the placement costs,&quot; he said. &quot;Then agencies began advertising &apos;$0 maids&apos;, and the cost was transferred to the worker \u2013 and those costs tended to go up.&quot; The Philippines is the only Asian country to have ratified the landmark International Labour Organisation convention on domestic workers (pdf), which \u2013 among other rights protections \u2013 bans salary deductions to pay placement fees. Manila&apos;s tough stance has pushed up demand for domestic workers from other countries, Gee said, with Singaporean employers knowing it will be harder to get Filipino workers to forfeit their rest day. &quot;The [employers] know the Filipinos will stand their ground, and they&apos;ve got government backing,&quot; he said. Workers from poorer countries such as Burma are marketed as &quot;docile&quot;, he added. &quot;When they talk about workers in these terms, it&apos;s a licence to exploit. They won&apos;t complain and will do what they are told \u2026 There is the same image, I&apos;m afraid, with workers from Cambodia.&quot; Gary Chin, managing director at Nation Employment, an agency in Singapore, said Filipino workers&apos; share of the market had plummeted from 90% two decades ago to 20-30% today because they were &quot;too expensive&quot;. &quot;If [employers] want to pay less, they will turn to those countries that still allow their maids to Singapore and are [paying] the placement fees, like Burma, Indonesia and Cambodia,&quot; Chin said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/11/travel-awards-2013-winners", "sentences": ["Photograph: Macduff Everton/Corbis    Winner Emirates Second Singapore Airlines Third Aer Lingus Fourth KLM Fifth Lufthansa Best business-class airline Winner Singapore Airlines Second BMI/FlyBMI Third Qatar Airways Fourth Emirates Fifth Etihad Best ferry company Winner Calmac/Caledonian Macbrayne Second Northlink Third Stena Line Fourth Norfolk Lines Fifth Brittany Ferries Best rail company Winner Eurotunnel Second Eurostar Third East Coast Fourth Chiltern Railways Fifth Virgin Trains Best UK hotel group  Winner Sofitel Second Hotel Du Vin &amp; Bistro Third Park Plaza Fourth Apex Fifth Radisson Hotels &amp; Resorts Best overseas hotel group Winner Mandarin Oriental Second Jumeirah Third Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Fourth Four Seasons Hotels &amp; Resorts Fifth Oberoi Hotels &amp; Resorts"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-11T12:03:00Z", "title": "Travel Awards 2013 winners", "tags": ["Travel"], "article": "Favourite UK city Winner Bath Second Edinburgh Third York Fourth Cambridge Fifth Newcastle upon Tyne Favourite overseas city Winner Tokyo Second San Francisco Third Copenhagen Fourth Bruges Fifth Sydney Favourite European country Winner Austria Second SwedenThird Croatia Fourth Turkey Fifth Switzerland Favourite long-haul country     Japan was voted favourite long-haul country.

Two US Marine C-130 cargo planes arrived in Tacloban, the coastal city where virtually every building was destroyed by the typhoon, and began distributing emergency items at the start of an aid effort involving dozens of countries and agencies. While the confirmed death toll remains at 942, the expectation is that the final tally could exceed 10,000, with a single mass grave in Tacloban reportedly containing 500 bodies and hundreds of others still scattered in streets, trees and buildings. Winds gusting to 170mph caused significant damage, but the devastation in coastal areas such as Tacloban, where the aftermath is reminiscent of the 2004 Indian ocean tsunami, was principally caused by a six metre storm surge that carried away even the concrete buildings in which many of the 800,000 moved by authorities had sought shelter. &quot;The situation is bad, the devastation has been significant. In some cases the devastation has been total,&quot; Philippines cabinet secretary Rene Almendras told reporters in Manila. Britain will dispatch a Type 45 destroyer and an RAF C130 Hercules aircraft to the Philippines, David Cameron has announced. The prime minister said: &quot;Britain is contributing \u00a310m, and HMS Daring, currently deployed near Singapore, will shortly be heading at full speed towards the disaster zone with further support from an RAF C17 which will be a powerful help to the relief operation.&quot; Conditions in Tacloban, on Leyte island, have so far been the most widely documented. The commander of the US Marine contingent, Brigadier General Paul Kennedy, said after a helicopter flight over the city: &quot;I don&apos;t believe there is a single structure that is not destroyed or severely damaged in some way. Every single building, every single house.&quot; However, reports are coming in of similar devastation in other towns, some still largely cut off from communication. As well as Leyte, the centre of typhoon Haiyan also tore across Samar island, to the east, and the upper tip of\u00a0Cebu,\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0west. Colonel John Sanchez of the Philippines armed forces posted aerial photographs of destruction in Guiuan, a town of about 40,000 people on the south-east coast of Samar, where Haiyan first made landfall. &quot;The only reason why we have no reports of casualties up to now is that communications systems are down,&quot; he said. &quot;One hundred percent of the structures either had their roofs blown away or sustained major damage.&quot; The mayor of Giporlos, further north on Sarar, rode for eight hours by motorbike to seek help following the &quot;total destruction&quot; of his coastal town of 12,000 people. In a video posted on the Rappler social news site, he said at least 95% of it had been damaged. Leo Dacaynos of the provincial disaster office in Samar said 300 people were confirmed dead in one town and another 2,000 missing, with other places yet to be reached. An Oxfam team which reached the far north of Cebu reported almost complete destruction there. With winds weakening to about 75mph, Haiyan, now downgraded to a tropical storm, made landfall in north Vietnam early on Monday. Authorities there evacuated hundreds of thousands of people but there were no reports of significant damage or injuries. However, reports in southern China said several people died as the storm moved into Hainan and Guangxi provinces. Two sailors died and five more missing after waves tore a boat from its mooring in Hainan. In the Philippines the aid effort is both enormous in scale \u2013 according to the United Nations about 4.5m people have been affected by the storm, with more than 600,000 displaced \u2013 and fraught with complications, with roads blocked and most ports and airports closed. In Tacloban even the initial work of removing bodies from the debris has yet to properly begin. Some desperate survivors are begging for supplies while others have ransacked shops, some of which are now guarded by police and soldiers. Co-ordinating the aid effort will be a major challenge, experts have warned. The international response to the catastrophic earthquake in Haiti in 2010 was plagued by confusion, prompting aid agencies to say people died needlessly because of chaotic initial phases of the humanitarian effort.

The McLaren development driver, is the favourite to partner Jenson Button after the Mexican&apos;s failure to fill the sizable boots of Lewis Hamilton, who quit the Woking-based team at the end of last year to join Mercedes. P\u00e9rez might be deemed unfortunate. At 23 he is 10 years younger than Button and has had three fewer years as a McLaren driver. Despite that he has been out-qualified by the British driver only nine times to eight this season. P\u00e9rez has also finished ahead of Button on five occasions, including the past two races. But for much of the season McLaren have clearly been unhappy with P\u00e9rez, who was rarely able to fulfil the promise he showed as a Sauber driver in 2012. It became especially clear during the Singapore race in September that McLaren were not happy with their man. But P\u00e9rez was still backed to hold on to his seat until the Abu Dhabi race this month. One reason for that is that teams are reluctant to change their drivers with fundamental changes to F1 coming next year, when 1.6-litre turbo-charged V6 engines will replace the current 2.4-litre V8s. Magnussen, the son of the former F1 driver Jan, recently won the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, beating another young McLaren driver, Stoffel Vandoorne, by 60 points. He has also impressed the McLaren team with recent eye-catching performances in the simulator, the most sophisticated in Formula 1. Magnussen says: &quot;Whenever I&apos;m asked about Formula 1, I always reply that, yes, I feel ready. I look at it this way \u2013 I&apos;ve done everything I could to prove myself in world series.&quot; But Magnussen, like P\u00e9rez, may turn out to be another one-season wonder. McLaren are under pressure from Honda \u2013 who will be their engine suppliers in 2015 \u2013 to up their game after a wretchedly disappointing season. It is no secret that McLaren are eager to lure Fernando Alonso from Ferrari for the 2015 season. And with Button, who has already signed for 2014, likely to stay for at least another year beyond that, Magnussen would be the driver most likely to make way \u2013 unless he can succeed where P\u00e9rez has failed and get the better of the 2009 champion. McLaren&apos;s team principal, Martin Whitmarsh, would not confirm the switch on Monday, when he said: &quot;The fact is at the moment we haven&apos;t confirmed our driver line-up.

Orange says Tizen strategy not ready yet - Rethink Wireless  The main operator supporters of Tizen are Orange and NTT Docomo, but while they were initially expected to launch Samsung-made devices this fall, they are now reluctant to offer any timescales, and launches certainly won&apos;t be this year. Yves Maitre, head of devices at Orange, told PC Advisor that a 2013 launch no longer made sense as the underlying strategy needed to be clearly worked out. &quot;We are reassessing our strategy together with the Tizen community on how to go to market and what that means in terms of features, price points and market positioning,&quot; he said, citing some lessons learned from the first wave of launches of handsets running Mozilla&apos;s Firefox OS, a competing platform to Tizen whose main carrier supporters are Telefonica and Deutsche Telekom.  This makes it sound as though Tizen is aimed at the carrier-supported end of the market - rather like Firefox OS. Those tend not to be the pricier phones. It is where the numbers are, though.

Samsung has relied on Android for some of its cameras so far, but has also quietly released Tizen-powered developer tablets and ported the OS to the Galaxy S4, showing off what it can do without Google&apos;s help. To that same end, Nokia announced today it will power &quot;maps-related functionalities&quot; in future Tizen devices, giving Samsung (and its partners) a chance to further reduce its dependency on Google services.

But this versatile energy harvester could be tuned to harvest the signal from other energy sources, including satellite signals, sound signals or Wi-Fi signals, the researchers say.  Somehow, Pebble is making a better smartwatch than gadget giants like Samsung and Sony &gt;&gt; VentureBeat  Samsung is a multibillion company with 425,000 employees and a massive supply chain. Pebble is 40-strong and fuelled by $10m in Kickstarter money.&lt; So you might be surprised at which one is making the better smartwatch. On Wednesday, Pebble unveiled the latest steps\u00a0in its effort to take over your wrist. It has a new, more powerful developer kit, and it finally supports all of the notifications coming out of iOS. Oh, and it also has companies like Foursquare, Yelp, and GoPro making native apps for the device.  Pebble is now quoting 250,000 watches sold: it may be the most successful smartwatch.

It&apos;s been a record-smashing mega-sale on hundreds of e-stores. Here at Alibaba HQ, the makers of China&apos;s top online marketplace are celebrating the biggest-ever shopping day: a grand total of $5.7bn (RMB 35.02 billion) spent in the course of just 24 hours.  That&apos;s only online, of course. The most popular store was Xiaomi. Samsung places fewer notebook component orders than expected &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Samsung Electronics&apos; component orders from June to October 2013 were reportedly only 40% of the Korea-based vendor&apos;s original forecast, while Apple&apos;s iMac shipments during the same period were also estimated to be 50% less than those in 2012, according to sources from the upstream supply chain. Some suppliers believe Samsung&apos;s notebook shipments in 2013 are unlikely to hit its goal and may only reach about 13m units, flat from 13.8m in 2012. However, some suppliers expect Samsung to see shipments decline in 2013.  Only those making tablet components are looking happy - a sign of the stresses going through the PC business. Theodolite goes to the Great Wall of China &gt;&gt; HRT Apps Craig Hunter&apos;s Theodolite app was featured in Apple&apos;s iPad launch, shown being used on the Great Wall of China - in a location about 32 miles north-north-west of Beijing:   What I find interesting is that version 4.0 of Theodolite HD was used in Apple&apos;s video clip, and that version was just released on October 2 as an iOS 7 update. That means Apple shot this video, did editing, production, etc., within the last 20 days in order to show it during the Special Event. It really demontrates how much effort they put into their videos. Just think of the resources required to do this, for one short clip in one video highlight of a keynote. Sometimes it takes me 14-21 days just to finalize copy and artwork for a print ad, and here Apple is shooting video up on a mountain halfway around the world and getting it in front of a VIP audience in 20 days.  The app looks interesting: Hunter says it has uses &quot;in avalanche research, tactical observation on the battlefield, search and rescue, and aircraft accident investigations. The app is an on-the-job tool for surveyors, architects, engineers, and scientists around the world.

Statistics on its urbanisation are mind-boggling no matter how we look at them: China will soon have the world&apos;s first 50-million-person city, and, in less than 10 years, will be home to nearly 100 of the world&apos;s 400 largest cities. Water provision is particularly challenging at this scale. China&apos;s ability to provide safe, reliable water for such megacities will be a core determinant of its development success. The old model of urban utility, where water and wastewater are treated in one place, passively distributed through networks to and from users, is hard to manage efficiently when cities reach unprecedented scale and complexity. Because of this, the market for &quot;smart&quot; water technology, such as advanced metering infrastructure, has been growing steadily, and examples are beginning to emerge. Cities like Singapore and Masdar have shown what an alternative could look like in practice: a fully controlled network, analogous to the electric grid, in which optimisation to reduce leakage can be done remotely and interactively, and where multiple sources of water \u2013 whether rainwater, treatment, or reuse \u2013 are co-ordinated and managed automatically. This vision for a &quot;smart&quot; urban water network has been slow in coming, due in large part to the unfavourable economics of the sector. But accelerated urbanisation in the developing world, coupled with increasing concerns for water security, has energised this market. This is a potentially game-changing opportunity for companies that provide automation and information technology. Urban water infrastructure is a market worth about $400bn (\u00a3250bn) per year, and growing fast. Anything that can increase its efficiency and effectiveness is bound to capture a share of this large pie. But layering urban supply infrastructure with technology is not the only way in which water will have to become &quot;smart.&quot; When in a city, it is easy to forget that water is first supplied by the hydrology and ecosystem function of the natural catchments that surround cities. Failure to manage those catchments can challenge even the most sophisticated urban water system. In fact, the availability of data on the performance of this &quot;natural infrastructure&quot; is the primary bottleneck to its inclusion in the toolkit of urban water managers. Take Beijing for example. The city relies on groundwater for over 70% of its supply, but that supply has been depleted by unconstrained demand. Meanwhile, surface water has been in large part polluted by industrial activity around the city, rendering it unusable. The situation has become so untenable that the Chinese government has invested over $60bn (\u00a337.5bn) in the south to north water transfer project, to source water from the Yangtze and transfer it north, where it can supply cities like Beijing. The challenge is that managing catchments so that they are a sustainable source of usable water requires a suite of sophisticated strategies. It means reducing agricultural demands by increasing its productivity, managing both point source and non-point source pollution, steering land use with an eye towards water yields, protecting forests, improving ranching, and restoring wetlands so that areas of critical hydrological importance are protected. Even more importantly, it requires all of these activities to happen in a coordinated and measurable fashion, and on the scale of the entire catchment, to maximise impact on water quality and quantity. Knowing what portfolio of strategies to adopt is no easy task. For this purpose, and in partnership with Stanford University&apos;s Natural Capital project and others, the Nature Conservancy has developed a system called the Resource Investment Optimization System (RIOS), a model that allows for analysis of investments in natural infrastructure in a catchment, and helps design a portfolio of aforementioned catchment interventions maximised to improve the condition of water sources. But the critical limiting factor to its adoption is the availability of real time accurate data that can help manage the catchments effectively at scale and relate a suite of practices to actual impact on water yield and quality. Things are likely to change, however. As cities across China and the rest of the developing world hit the walls of limited resources, the increasing cost of adding new water through traditional supply infrastructure should incentivise the active protection of source water. This will turn the optimisation of practices in a catchment into a potentially attractive market opportunity, one that should support the necessary smart information infrastructure for its operational management. Already, remote sensing technology applied to land use as well as to the management of groundwater is making steady progress. Technology companies are starting to see the opportunity. While early days, incumbents like CISCO and IBM have increasingly made forays into the world of data-intensive watershed management. The new megacities of the world, such as those emerging in China right now, could be the drivers of this smart revolution. Active management of catchments, on the back of scientifically sound and reliable data, could turn the work of environmentalists into a tool in the toolkit of water managers, and provide a route to scale for catchment protection across the developing world.

They have skill, knowledge, empathy and dedication in abundance. They also have talent. Some of it is learned and some is just a mystical part of their persona. So if great teaching has a lot to do with talent, what should we do about finding and promoting it? One of the most famous parables of Christian theology is the Parable of the Talents. It tells of a master with three servants who gave them all an amount of currency, in &apos;talents&apos;, before he went away. Two of the slaves invested their talents, increased their value and were duly rewarded when their master returned. The third buried his talents, did not increase their value, and was punished as a result. In our youth, this parable struck us as deeply unfair. It seemed to reward risk and irresponsibility and punish prudence and thrift. It looked down on people like our mums who hung on to what precious little they had, to avoid putting their family at risk. It&apos;s not just because we&apos;re older or better off that we now see the point of the parable. It&apos;s also because we have come to appreciate that talent is a human quality, not just a piece of currency. And in teaching \u2013 the only profession that creates the generations of the future on a massive scale \u2013 this talent is priceless. Talent is not just something we should hope our teachers have and feel lucky when they do. It is something we have to find, invest in, build, and circulate, very deliberately, if we are going to get great returns from it. Approaching talent development in this way is what we call investment in professional capital. The professional capital of teachers cannot be squandered recklessly for short-term gains. Nor should it be squirreled away in individual schools and classrooms so no one else can have access to it. But this is exactly what too many people are doing \u2013 especially people in policy. When England draws its teachers from the bottom half of the university graduation range \u2013 unlike educational high performers such as Finland, Singapore, Korea and Canada \u2013 it doesn&apos;t even get hold of enough talent in the first place. When it starts to use competitive systems of performance-driven pay linked to pupil achievement results, it gives teachers the perverse incentive to keep their talent to themselves so as to preserve their own precarious survival. Just like our mums. None of the high-performing nations treats their teachers like this. Old-style teacher unionism squirrels away teachers&apos; talents by defending individual teacher autonomy and the longevity of experience over research and professional expertise. But look what other unions do. The Alberta Teachers&apos; Association spends half its budget on research and professional development and has worked collaboratively with the government to replace standardised testing with rigorous in-class assessments in 2015. The California Teachers&apos; Association sued Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for $2.6 billion, and then used the money to take responsibility for turning around hundreds of the lowest-performing schools in the state. These unions develop and share their talents and put them to good use. Meanwhile, the creeping tendency in some academies and free schools to take teachers who are young, enthusiastic, flexible and cheap, then moving them on to make way for equally flexible and frugal replacements squanders all the investment in time and mentoring that more experienced teachers give to each cohort of novices who come through. These are not the only flawed or failed strategies for teacher talent development. Teacher standards are easy to write and they exist all over the world, but there is no consistent evidence that they lead to teacher excellence or student success. Self-regulating professional bodies are admirable in intent, but internationally they have only been rigorous when membership has been voluntary, and they have lacked bite when they have been inclusive of almost everybody. Online professional development, yet more workshops, and part-time master&apos;s degrees (rather than the full-time ones in Finland) might increase awareness of new ideas, but they don&apos;t dig deep into the details of practice. So if performance-based pay, teacher standards, old-style unionism, individual professional development, professional self-regulation and turning more and more to younger and cheaper generations of teachers are the wrong drivers of teacher talent development, what are the right ones? By themselves, these things don&apos;t offer any basis for widespread implementation or innovation. By contrast, if they are well-led by headteachers or others, collaborative cultures of teachers working and learning together that circulate wisdom and expertise and that connect with the best ideas of research evidence are far more powerful forces for change because they make learning part of teachers&apos; work, in every school, every day. For 12 years, teachers in 95% of Alberta&apos;s schools were funded to design, inquire into and share their own innovations. In Finland, teachers spend more time out of the classroom \u2013 to collaborate with other teachers \u2013 than any other teachers in the world. Only when you have intense, ingrained cultures of professional collaboration can performance appraisal, professional development and all the other wrong drivers of teacher talent development start to have a more powerful effect. Talent attraction and development becomes embedded in the organisation. Social talent is prized along with individual talent. They feed on each other in a virtuous circle. This means a new bargain for teachers and teaching \u2013 more autonomy from unnecessary bureaucratic interference; but less autonomy from each other. Collective autonomy should now replace individual autonomy. These right policy drivers are used by high-performing systems. They attract the best individual human capital at the outset. They build and circulate the social capital of strong teacher communities. And they grow the decisional capital of making good judgments that, as in other professions, develops over many years of practice through constant challenge and stretching. Throw into all this the best and latest findings of research evidence for teacher communities to test, apply and refine with their own good judgement, and you will have riches of professional capital beyond measure. You don&apos;t get talent by coercion. You don&apos;t develop it on your own. And you never grow it if you roll it over every few years. We must stop squirreling away and squandering our teachers&apos; talent. It&apos;s time to invest in it like other high performing nations do and to see our children enjoy many happy and fruitful returns in their learning for generations to come.

Goldman Sachs and UBS led an offer that has been widely criticised for short-changing taxpayers by selling a major government asset on the cheap, after Royal Mail shares immediately soared on the stock exchange and continue to trade at a premium of around 70%. Those concerns have been exacerbated by the presence of sovereign wealth funds \u2013 including Kuwait, Singapore and Abu Dhabi \u2013 on the Royal Mail&apos;s share register. One senior City source, who has worked on major UK privatisations, said: &quot;The Royal Mail was probably a bit cheap, but it is one thing to sell it at a cut-price to UK pension funds \u2026 There was a disproportionate amount of shares that went to sovereign wealth funds.&quot; Senior representatives from Goldmans and UBS will appear in parliament next Wednesday to answer questions from MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee, alongside peers from JP Morgan, Citibank, Deutsche Bank and stockbroker Panmure Gordon. The MPs&apos; concerns over the flotation are echoed by City figures. A top UK fund manager said: &quot;A lot of people were very upset at their allocation, even on day zero before the shares started trading at a premium. &quot;It may be that the advisers did not take account of the political implications and do as good a job as they could have done.&quot; A source close to the committee confirmed: &quot;This is something the committee is aware of. It may well come up in the session.&quot; In the months running up to the privatisation, it is understood that Royal Mail, the government and its advisers were working with a small group of financial institutions in order to get an early idea of how the shares should be priced. That inner core of investors, which is thought to have largely excluded top UK pension fund managers, ended up with the most sizeable allocations. Among the top three new investors in Royal Mail are GIC Private, formerly known as the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, which has a 4% stake, and Kuwait Investment Office, which holds 1.42%. Meanwhile, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has 0.09%, according to the financial data provider Thomson Reuters. However, Royal Mail&apos;s new owners also include a string of financial institutions, including the likes of UBS (Luxembourg)\u00a0SA, which own shares on behalf of anonymous clients including sovereign wealth funds. Royal Mail&apos;s official share register fails to provide further detail on its new owners, as virtually all shareholders are hidden behind nominee accounts. Neither Goldman Sachs nor UBS would comment on how they had allocated the shares. The key focus of the BIS committee next Wednesday, however, will be the valuation assigned to Royal Mail, which was largely set by salesmen from Goldman Sachs and UBS, in conjunction with the government and its adviser, the investment bank Lazard. Shares in the postal service floated at 330p and immediately soared, something that had been predicted by a number of City analysts not working on the float, who are forced to calculate valuations without the breadth of information provided to official banking advisers. Royal Mail shares closed on Thursday at 557p \u2013 an increase of more than \u00a32.2bn on the company&apos;s flotation value. Gert Zonneveld, co-head of research at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said in early October that he was convinced the government&apos;s official valuation of Royal Mail at \u00a32.6bn-\u00a33.3bn - or 260p-330p a share - was a significant undervaluation, giving his initial range of \u00a33.7bn-\u00a34.5bn. &quot;I&apos;m so convinced they [the government] got it wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;I think they&apos;re more than \u00a31bn too low.&quot; A subsequent Zonneveld note after the shares had been floated then valued Royal Mail at \u00a35.7bn, or 570p a share.  Perhaps equally embarrassing for the government is the \u00a36bn valuation put on the company in early October by a computer programme called Quest, which is run by the investment bank Canaccord. Quest was designed by Terry Smith, the outspoken boss of the City brokerage firm Tullett Prebon, where Michael Fallon, the minister of state and one of the key government figures leading the float, sat on the board for eight years. Vince Cable, the business secretary, will appear in front of the committee on 27\u00a0November, accompanied by a representative from Lazard. One City source described the suggestion that sovereign wealth funds were favoured by the banks out of expediency as &quot;overly cynical&quot;, as they were large, long-term investors in many shares listed on the London Stock Exchange."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/15/confidence-trap-david-runciman-review", "sentences": ["The only world leaders with a spring in\u00a0their step during that meeting, held amid the crisis of a crumbling eurozone and apparent meltdown in Greece and\u00a0Italy, were from China, Singapore, Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-15T07:00:01Z", "title": "The Confidence Trap: A History of Democracy in Crisis from World War I to the Present by David Runciman \u2013 review", "tags": ["Politics", "Books", "Politics", "UK news", "US politics", "World news", "Culture"], "article": "In November 2011, Paul Mason, then economics editor of Newsnight, was struck by a pattern he observed while covering the G20 summit in Cannes. The only world leaders with a spring in\u00a0their step during that meeting, held amid the crisis of a crumbling eurozone and apparent meltdown in Greece and\u00a0Italy, were from China, Singapore, Russia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia. Those\u00a0were the countries with money in their pockets and, Mason noted, something else in common too. With the exception of Brazil, these were nations unburdened by democracy. In the aftermath of the crash of 2008, it was the democratic states who seemed to take the hit. Europe and the US shrivelled in the face of the Great Recession, while authoritarian China kept on growing. That G20 meeting was one of several where the democratic world seemed bereft of answers, unable to steady a tottering euro and much else. This did not look like coincidence. In the face of economic calamity, democracy itself seemed fatally hobbled. If Beijing or Moscow had decided on austerity, for example, they\u00a0could have imposed it by instant diktat, with no need to build popular consent. Democracy lacked such potency. No wonder democratically elected governments in Athens and Rome were pushed aside in favour of technocrats who had won no ballot: they at least could get things done. Such a sentiment did not begin with the 2008 crash. Frustration at the world&apos;s inability to act on climate change already had many cursing democracy. The planet might be choking from excess carbon, but in a democracy you can&apos;t put up a single wind turbine without the approval of villagers who\u00a0complain it will spoil the view. That&apos;s just the way democracy is, the parochial and short-term trumping the bigger picture every time. Who could blame those who pined for the free hand of the autocrat, able to do what needs to be done \u2013 including the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who once said he wished America could be &quot;China for a day&quot;. Enter David Runciman, professor of\u00a0politics at Cambridge, with a lucid, wholly original book that says those fears were, if not wrong, then embarrassingly familiar. The Confidence Trap charts a century of similar moments, when the public intellectuals of the day were seized by the fear that democracy had reached the end of the road. In chapters on 1918, 1933, 1947, 1962, 1974, 1989 and 2008, he reveals a pattern of repeated mood swings, in which complacency about democracy&apos;s supremacy and inevitable triumph gives way to despair about its limitations and inability to meet the challenges of the age. In 1933 HG Wells predicted that democracy would soon be discarded as\u00a0&quot;altogether too slow-witted for the urgent political and economic riddles, with ruin and death at hand&quot;. The sentiment is not that far off the report published by the Trilateral commission in 1975, whose eminent authors, anxious that inflation, stagnation and\u00a0Watergate-era scandal posed an impossible menace, gloomily titled it\u00a0&quot;The Crisis of Democracy&quot;. Those worries echo, in turn, those voiced by\u00a0Mason and others (including me) in\u00a0the last two or three years. For Runciman, that pattern is itself\u00a0part of a larger phenomenon. Democracies develop confidence in their long-term resilience, based in part on their ability to adapt (in contrast with rigid autocracy). This confidence that all will end well leads democratic states to be complacent, allowing problems to fester, safe in the knowledge that, when it really counts, they&apos;ll solve them. Those problems eventually come to a head in the form of a grave crisis. But confronted with such a crisis, democracies usually do adapt just enough to survive. Confidence returns, which eventually turns into complacency and so it begins again. This is the confidence trap. Democracy, says Runciman, can never escape it. It&apos;s a paradoxical idea that the author repeatedly expresses through paradox. &quot;Lots of little failures combine to produce lasting success,&quot; he writes, referring to the way in which politics in a democracy appears, partly thanks to a free press, constantly to lurch from scandal to disaster to crisis and back again. At any given moment, everything is a mess. Only later, in hindsight, do we understand that those little failures were democracy&apos;s way of staying on course. Thus Watergate in the US, and the matching sense of political turmoil in 1970s Europe, racked by domestic terrorism and industrial unrest, served in fact as an &quot;outlet for discontent&quot; unavailable to the autocracies of, say, eastern Europe. Those regimes had to smother discontent, rather than being able to adapt, accommodate and eventually absorb it. Within 15 years, those brittle communist regimes had all been toppled \u2013 while the democracies, once so anxiously prophesying their own doom, were still muddling through. By way of concrete illustration, he cites that favourite of the political press corps: the leadership crisis. At the time, these seem disastrous. Think of France in 1917, going through four prime ministers in a single year. That looked like chaos, but it meant France &quot;could keep going until they got the right one&quot;, eventually settling on Georges Cl\u00e9menceau. Contrast that with the German strongman of the hour, Erich Ludendorff, initially lionised as precisely the decisive master of events no democracy could ever produce. But when, in 1918, Ludendorff ran out of ideas, undemocratic Germany was stuck with him. In their own chaotic, often comical way, democracies stumble and stagger towards the right answer. Autocracies march with great purpose and in impressively straight lines, even when they are heading off a cliff. The problem with this pattern \u2013 and, more importantly, with our knowledge of it, which increases as the years go by and our experience mounts up \u2013 is that we relax because of it. We know that it&apos;ll be all right on the night, so we don&apos;t act when we should. Every warning bell sounds the same as any other, the false and hysterical the same\u00a0as the real and serious. In the cacophony of a democracy, with the media crying &quot;crisis&quot; seven days a week, it&apos;s hard to tell one from the other. So we screen it all out, believing that when it really counts, we&apos;ll know about it. This tendency to fatalism was spotted early, by the 19th century French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville whose Democracy in America is the subject of\u00a0an opening, admiring chapter. Runciman quotes Tocqueville&apos;s observation of early American ferrymen, sending passengers out on fragile vessels that were barely seaworthy. Why didn&apos;t the manufacturers make better ones? Because &quot;the art of steamboat navigation was making daily progress&quot;, meaning the boats would soon be obsolete anyway. Their faith in the future prevented them taking necessary action today. As it was on the rivers, so it is with democracy. All this is presented with a bracing intellectual confidence. Runciman roams across the century, drawing evidence from US, French, British, Italian and German history with equal brio. There is no havering, none of the anxious qualifying of every assertion that impedes so much academic writing. There are no graphs or conventional data. It is written colloquially \u2013 democracies don&apos;t &quot;get hung up on tradition&quot;; a democracy has &quot;to suck up its mistakes&quot; \u2013 and does not shy away from the sweeping generalisation. In a word of warning to his scholarly colleagues, and perhaps as a disclaimer, Runciman avows that &quot;This book is not a work of political science.&quot; It aims instead to describe the biggest possible picture, to reveal certain underlying truths about the political idea that aspires to be the universal system of mankind. The book is ambitious, in the best sense of\u00a0that word. But Runciman offers no manual; his is not a manifesto for how democracy might smarten up its act or extricate itself from the confidence trap. Indeed, he charts the failures of all such past attempts to shortcut what is an organic process, skipping over the intermediate delays and missteps and getting to democracy&apos;s long-term knack for doing the right thing more quickly. It\u00a0cannot be done. That can be frustrating for those readers hungry for an answer to, say, democracy&apos;s apparent powerlessness over the money markets. That group\u00a0might well include Bill Clinton who, on realising he had to trim his economic plans to placate those who lend money\u00a0to the US government, famously bellowed to his aides: &quot;You mean to tell me that the success of my programme and my re-election hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of fucking bond traders?&quot; But Clinton will get little satisfaction on that score from Runciman, who detachedly observes that both left and right saw vindication in the 2008 crash without delivering a\u00a0judgment on who was right. His book ends with another maritime metaphor of Tocqueville&apos;s. Democracy is a river flowing through history, choppy and fast. Fix on the distant shore and you risk ignoring the perilous eddies and currents directly in front of you. Fix too closely on those, however, and you&apos;ll lose sight of your ultimate destination. None of this helps you steer, Runciman concedes, &quot;But it is better to know.&quot; And he is a compelling guide."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2013/nov/15/tomorrow-tube-london-underground-stations-commercial-development", "sentences": ["It hasn&apos;t gone unnoticed at TfL that this is the mechanism used in Hong Kong and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-15T11:35:00Z", "title": "Tomorrow's Tube: signage, shops and station transformations", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "London Underground", "Transport policy", "Transport", "London", "London politics", "David Cameron"], "article": "Step off an up escalator at Oxford Circus station and you&apos;re at a gateway to the most famous shopping avenues in the land. But if you didn&apos;t already know that, could you tell? Exit signs provide compass point directions to different sides of Oxford Street and Regent Street but nothing more. The retail presence comprises two newsagents and a key cutter. Little about the space speaks of entering consumer wonderland.  Maybe that should change. The ticket hall-transit well can&apos;t become a partial mall \u2013 with people entering or exiting it 77 million times a year, there&apos;s a congestion problem as it is \u2013 but perhaps the space could shimmer with digital advertising boards ushering visitors towards H&amp;M or Nike Town, projecting details of new products or counting down to the start of a sale.  What that be good? What would &quot;good&quot; mean? For those running Regent Street, I&apos;m told, good would be the thematic message that &quot;the Regent Street experience starts here.&quot; For Transport for London, good would be making life easier for West End visitors in ways that also provide a revenue stream. The same thinking might apply to Piccadilly Circus station, along with reclaiming some of the Charles Holden architecture that has become blocked and lost. These are the sorts of lines TfL is thinking along as part of its much wider commercial development operation. For 18 months the relevant department has been calculating potential and now describes the opportunities as &quot;colossal.&quot; A ten-year programme aims to raise \u00a33.5b, this target to be met through projects ranging from relatively cosmetic enhancements to station environments to major redevelopment joint ventures withfellow landowners. It&apos;s worth reflecting on the fact that TfL owns 5,700 acres of Greater London \u2013 a tidy slice. Much of that is road space and railway track but the 270 Underground stations alone represent, in the jargon, substantial value to be unlocked.  A lot that value lies in creating more and better retail options both within the Tube network itself and in the surroundings of some of its stations. There are already 1,000 TfL-owned retail units in London all told. Many are small and in small sites, and current annual earnings from them are a fairly small part of what TfL as a whole makes from sources other than fares: \u00a325m a year out of \u00a3250m, of which advertising comprises over \u00a3100m. Yet the aspiration is to make the best use possible of every square foot, including on the Tube.  Even on a dismal February Tuesday 3.7 million people use the Underground \u2013 more than seven times the population of Manchester. Planners at TfL get their heads round what that could mean by imagining the Tube labyrinth as a warren of supermarket aisles and those 3.7 million as customers. As one senior executive puts it, until Star Trek-style teleportation is invented their massive footfall won&apos;t get any smaller or go anywhere else. What could be put on those metaphorical supermarket shelves that all those people might want?  Stocking them in the years to come could mean everything from contributing to making more of Morden town centre at the southern end of the Northern Line to getting in on the online act. As I reported last week, a pilot installation of Amazons lockers will be launched before the end of the year and other &quot;click-and-collect&quot; operators will be involved too (some collection points will be in TfL car parks, but others will be stations). Next year, the feasibility of phone signals penetrating the Underground will be explored, opening up the possibility of in-transit passengers ordering coffee and a croissant in advance from an in-station outlet at the stop they will get off at. More sophisticated relationships between passengers and shops are being looked into: tailored product ranges, discount deals and so on.  Various redevelopment angles are being explored, varying from site to site. The transport body&apos;s involvement in the controversial - and, in my view, undesirable - Earls Court project is one example already underway. But TfL insists that its property operation contains a corporate social responsibility component: it isn&apos;t just about maximising income, an approach dismissed as the wrong commercial answer in the long run anyway.  It is usually efficient in economic terms to maximise density of homes, shops and services around and, in some case, above Tube stations. It hasn&apos;t gone unnoticed at TfL that this is the mechanism used in Hong Kong and Singapore. Neither has Toronto&apos;s famous PATH subterranean &quot;downtown walkway&quot; or, right here at home, the underground malls of Canary Wharf. TfL&apos;s options are more constrained, but they&apos;re confident that more can be done.  Yet I&apos;m assured that TfL involvement in regeneration projects should also seek to provide what might be missing from surrounding areas - it might be a supermarket but it might also be a library, a police station, a post office or a cr\u00e8che. How can the station be better connected with the space around it? Can adjoining TfL properties, notably many hundreds under railway arches, be made better use of to that end?  The commercial development programme for the Underground will take different forms and come in different sizes, but some of the smallest could make a significant difference to the way a station feels and is made use of within the next few years. Some of the larger ambitions will take a lot of time and effort to realise. Here&apos;s a little list of some of the other Tube stations TfL is working on plans to change and improve. Baker Street A &quot;glorious piazza&quot; is envisaged for outside the station with cafes, restaurants and better shops. Notwithstanding the traffic of Marylebone Road this is seen as a spot where visitors to Madam Toussauds and unhurried commuters alike could pleasantly pass the time of day.  South Kensington Past revamp proposals have fallen foul of residents fearing over-commercialisation of a station many think of as their own. TfL sees its task as finding the right solution to improving the shops and ticket hall, enhancing signposting and creating a &quot;sense of arrival&quot; within the two-level station, befitting the excitement of visiting the Science, Natural History and Victoria and Albert museums.  Southgate An example of a smaller, Outer London station, Grade II-listed, which TfL thinks needs some money spent on it and its surroundings.  Harrow-on-the-Hill Its novelty lies in the steps up and over the tracks to the platforms at one entrance (if memory serves), but this very feature makes it a priority for step-free access. That&apos;s expensive, and TfL says it wants to look into a deal that would fund this along with improving the shops and clearing away some clutter.  Old Street  For years, a dingy maze of gloomy tunnels made uglier still by the huge and hideous advertising arches at the centre of the roundabout above. Any big re-vamp here would reflect and enhance the celebrated Silicon Roundabout cluster. Boris Johnson and David Cameron unveiled a set of plans last year, but there are competing cases for the wider transport solution here. Your wise comments and suggestions for changes in and around other London Underground stations are welcome.

Contracts with Vestergaard Frandsen and Sumitomo Chemical Singapore were suspended on Thursday pending a full review after a two-and-a-half-year investigation. A report published by the Global Fund&apos;s office of the inspector general found that between 2006 and 2011, the suppliers paid commisions to two Cambodian officials from the National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control (CNM), totalling $410,000 (\u00a3304,534), in return for awarding contracts for insecticide-treated bednets, which help prevent the spread of malaria. The report also cited &quot;improper charges and manipulation of procurement practices&quot; at two other organisations, which brought the total amount involved to about $431,000. The Global Fund&apos;s sanctions panel, which includes internal and independent experts to evaluate cases of wrongdoing, recommended that the two suppliers named in the report be suspended pending a full review of the case. The investigation found that all the mosquito nets procured by the grant had been provided. &quot;We cannot tolerate unethical conduct anywhere,&quot; said Mark Dybul, the Global Fund&apos;s executive director. &quot;Although this case had no direct impact on Cambodia&apos;s fight against malaria, taking commissions in exchange for contracts violates our mission of public service. We remain fully committed to pursuing fraud and taking action when we find it.&quot; The fund, which is due to hold a replenishment event in December, said Vestergaard and Sumitomo had &quot;both fully co-operated with the investigation&quot;, and had taken action against the employees involved, as well as steps to prevent similar incidents in future. At the time of publication, neither company was available to comment. The Global Fund has disbursed $331m to support HIV, TB and malaria programmes in Cambodia since 2003. Since then, Cambodia has seen an 80% drop in malaria deaths, a 45% fall in TB cases and a 50% decline in HIV infections. Over the past few years, the fund has sharpened its procedures to investigate allegations of corruption and fraud among recipient countries. Serious allegations of financial mismanagement prompted Germany to suspend its donations to the fund at the beginning of 2011, sparking concerns that other donors may follow suit. In a statement published on Thursday, the fund said that over the past two years, it had taken &quot;multiple actions to protect its investments by significantly strengthening deterrence and minimising the risk of abuse&quot;. &quot;A new framework for procurement was established, with a comprehensive approach to ensure all bulk purchasing is consistently undertaken in a fair, transparent, lawful and ethical manner,&quot; it added. The organisation has also faced a gaping hole in funding, which led to the cancellation of its 2011 to 2013 round of grant-making. In December, the fund will hold its fourth replenishment round, where it hopes that donors will pledge the $15bn (\u00a39.3bn) it needs between 2014 and 2016. In September, the UK promised \u00a31bn over three years on condition that other donors step up. The US has promised $1.65bn in its 2014 budget; Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Iceland have already pledged $750m. Over the past year, the fund has held several meetings with donors to highlight its value for money.

Among those lucky enough to have jobs, real wages have been falling for most since the 1970s. Republicans have a solution: get the government out of the way, then sit back and wait for an entrepreneurial explosion to launch the economy to unprecedented prosperity. Democrats have a different solution: trust them to set up exactly the right structure of economic and social policies, then sit back and wait for an entrepreneurial explosion to launch the economy to unprecedented prosperity. Most Americans wisely reject both solutions. The Republican approach requires faith in a magical &quot;invisible hand&quot;. The Democratic approach requires that too, but also a faith in policy makers&apos; ability to properly manipulate an infinite set of unpredictable economic and social variables to free the invisible hand to do its magical work. The Republican theory is much more accessible to people who never took a class in economics: &quot;the government is the problem, get rid of government interference&quot;. The Democratic theory requires more fealty to complex models and elite academics. Elizabeth Warren was one of those academic policy makers. But while the Democratic establishment was being led down Wall Street like a bull by the nose, Warren was sticking up for common sense and ordinary consumers. She came to prominence on the Tarp oversight panel, where she called for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to be created. President Obama created the agency, but picked someone more Wall Street friendly than Warren to lead it.  Warren had the last laugh when she became a US senator, and quickly emerged as 2016&apos;s only possible anti-Hillary \u2013 though she insists she is not, at the moment, thinking of running. Elizabeth Warren could defeat Hillary Clinton in the primaries. Barack Obama beat Hillary by merely implying that he would clean up Wall Street. Elizabeth Warren is explicitly crusading to break up too big to fail banks, regulate consumer debt, and block Wall Street bonus excesses.  After the progressive base nominates her, the general electorate will have some practical questions, such as: why will a swarm of small banks be less likely to crash the economy than a few large ones? Anybody willing to think for more than five seconds about the structure of the banking industry will be familiar with the savings and loan debacle, when bad loans in an industry of small banks nearly bring the economy to its knees. Some reasonable voters may ask if it wouldn&apos;t be easier to regulate a few large banks than a sprawling decentralized industry of many small ones. Many voters will have a problem with Warren&apos;s proposed clampdown on the consumer credit industry. To the extent that they even understand what she&apos;s proposing, it&apos;s going to sound like she wants to cut off their access to credit cards, auto loans and mortgages. As irresponsible as the consumer credit industry has been, voters will legitimately want to know how Warren proposes to supply them with a car to get to work when they don&apos;t have the money to pay for one and groceries when a meager paycheck has been spent.  Which brings us to the real issue that American workers care about \u2013 about which neither Warren nor her Republican opponent will have anything credible to say: how do we create high-paying jobs for American workers? The real solution is unfortunately beyond the imagination of almost any Democrat or Republican. The real solution is a massive mobilization of labor and capital to redevelop the US economy \u2013 something that the US and every industrialized country has done before. The great American example is the second world war, when the government worked with the private sector to super-size the national economy in an all-out sprint to reindustrialize an entire nation. More recent examples, taking place under governments of many political persuasions, include Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and China. Europe had two surges of intentional industrialization \u2013 one before the second world war and one after. Like America&apos;s great mobilization, most of Europe&apos;s took place within a liberal democratic framework. All these intentional industrializations and reindustrializations had one thing in common: a society mobilized labor and capital directly, on a massive scale, in the cause of increasing the productivity of the national economy.  Unfortunately, Elizabeth Warren&apos;s new wing of the Democratic party is not even capable of imagining that kind of mobilization. The only way to get from Warren&apos;s policy proposals to jobs and higher wages is through a long and indirect chain of causality.

Shares that were sold at 330p have been trading above 550p for the past three weeks. In hard money, the difference in market valuation is \u00a32.2bn, or \u00a31.3bn if one looks solely at the 60% stake sold by the state. Taxpayers could have done better \u2013 much better. The semi-official excuse \u2013 that a soaraway price is what can happen when a few enthusiasts chase shares in short supply \u2013 clearly carries some weight. It is true, for example, that the intervention of Chris Hohn at hedge fund TCI, who bought 5.8% of Royal Mail soon after listing (with maybe more to follow), was a surprise factor. But TCI&apos;s arrival is not a full explanation. As the business select committee attempts to find out more in the next fortnight, here are three questions: 1 Was the government too in awe of its investment bankers? Sensibly, the committee has summoned representatives from banks that were not selected as advisers but which, it is said, placed higher valuations on Royal Mail. JP Morgan&apos;s testimony should be worth hearing. If it is true that the bank told the government that Royal Mail could be worth between \u00a36.75bn and \u00a39bn under favourable market conditions, let&apos;s hear the details. If the valuation was back-of-a-fag-packet guesswork in the style of an estate agent touting for work, Cable would have been within his rights to be sceptical. But if JP Morgan had conducted in-depth analysis on Royal Mail&apos;s assets, especially its property assets, then it&apos;s a different matter. At the very least, the government should have been prepared for the possibility that Royal Mail could be a flyer, notwithstanding the company&apos;s grim record on industrial relations. Yes, the postal service was a tricky business to value. But that was an argument for being flexible until the last minute. Far too early in the process, the government seems to have accepted the view, presumably advanced by bookrunners Goldman Sachs and UBS, that \u00a33bn-ish would be a &quot;good&quot; price at which to sell. How hard did Lazards, the direct government adviser, press Goldman and UBS? 2 Was Cable too obsessed by attracting long-term investors? He was clear that he wanted Royal Mail to have &quot;a high-quality long-term investor base&quot;. In principle, that&apos;s fine: excessive short-termism in markets is a problem, as the Kay report commissioned by Cable argues persuasively. And Royal Mail, with years of restructuring in prospect, is the type of firm that could benefit from having patient owners. But preferring long-term investors doesn&apos;t guarantee value-for-money for taxpayers, which was meant to be the top priority for a government that claimed to have learned the lessons of the giveaway flotations of the 1980s. What if other investors were prepared to pay more for the shares? As Hohn at TCI has demonstrated, aggressive hedge funds are free to play anyway once the shares are listed. So did the collection of preferred long-term funds \u2013 &quot;a focused group of approximately 20 investors,&quot; according to Cable \u2013 simply acquire greater influence over the final pricing of Royal Mail shares? Several, we are told, threatened to pull out if the float price was bumped above 330p. Well, they would: the government had signalled to them that they had bargaining power. 3 Why were foreign sovereign wealth funds allocated shares? The possibility of an underpricing was blindingly obvious in the days before flotation, so the government could have saved itself much aggravation by ensuring all the shares in the heavily over-subscribed offer were allocated to UK retail buyers and UK pension funds. Royal Mail, after all, was a state-owned asset funded by the UK public purse. Why should investment funds representing the governments of Kuwait, Singapore and Abu Dhabi receive a slice of cheap shares? Disappointed applicants complain the relationship between foreign wealth funds and international banks such as Goldman Sachs and UBS was just too cosy. It&apos;s a reasonable view. Are some of the big winners from the housing recovery \u2013 or bubble as London readers will see it \u2013 getting nervous? There certainly seems to be a trend to take a few chips off the table. Private equity fund Apollo this week sold its remaining 10% stake in Countrywide, the estate agency firm that floated in March and has since seen its shares surge in value. At Rightmove, the property-search website valued at an astonishing \u00a32.5bn, non-executive chairman Scott Forbes exercised share options, sold the lot, and banked \u00a33.1m before tax. His chief executive, Nick McKittrick, last month did similarly and collected \u00a36.1m. These are life-changing sums, so one can&apos;t blame the Rightmove bosses for choosing financial security for themselves. After all, profit margins of 70% \u2013 its eye-catching achievement last year on revenues of \u00a3119m \u2013 tend not to last forever. Still, \u00a32.5bn for Rightmove is an out-and-out bargain if Snapchat can be worth roughly the same sum. Never heard of it? It&apos;s the messaging service that allows you to send pictures that disappear after ten seconds. The app \u2013 apparently \u2013 is very popular with the sexting generation. Some 350m photos are shared on Snapchat every day. From a valuation point of view, there&apos;s a problem. Snapchat is free and doesn&apos;t carry adverts. Thus there are no revenues. This apparent drawback did not prevent Facebook from offering to buy Snapchat for $3bn (\u00a31.9bn), says the Wall Street Journal. Naturally, 23-year-old co-founder Evan Spiegel declined the offer. He thinks he&apos;ll get more if he waits. Brave call. But, actually, it&apos;s Facebook&apos;s shareholders who should be asking questions. If their leader Mark Zuckerberg is so rattled by a no-revenue, no-ads upstart that he is willing to buy it for $3bn, he must be worried that teenagers are already bored with Facebook."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/17/edward-snowden-diplomats-hotel-bookings-documents", "sentences": ["The papers did not name any hotels or diplomats who had been spied upon, though unnamed hotels in Zurich and Singapore were cited as examples."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-17T20:30:33Z", "title": "Snowden cache reveals diplomats' hotel bookings being tracked by GCHQ", "tags": ["Edward Snowden", "GCHQ", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "A programme devised by British intelligence allowed analysts to monitor the bookings of foreign diplomats at 350 top hotels across the world, according to documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported on Sunday that the automated system alerted the UK&apos;s eavesdropping centre, GCHQ, to the timings and locations of diplomats&apos; travel arrangements. The papers make clear that these details allowed the &quot;technical operations community&quot; to make necessary preparations before the visits, the magazine said, suggesting that the diplomats&apos; rooms would be monitored or bugged. The GCHQ programme, called Royal Concierge, was first trialled in 2010 and has been in operation since then, the papers reveal. The programme worked by intercepting reservation confirmations when they were sent to government addresses from any of the 350 monitored hotels, said Spiegel online. The papers did not name any hotels or diplomats who had been spied upon, though unnamed hotels in Zurich and Singapore were cited as examples. Separate documents seen by Spiegel listed the potential capabilities for monitoring a hotel room, which included wiretapping the telephone and fax machine as well as monitoring computers hooked up to the hotel network. According to Spiegel, one of the presentations describing Royal Concierge was entitled Tales from the Wild, Wild West of GCHQ Operational Data-Mining. GCHQ said it would not confirm or deny the story, which is the latest to emerge from the cache of documents leaked by Snowden this year.

The document, dated November 2009, names the president and nine of his inner circle as targets of the surveillance, including the vice-president, Boediono, who last week visited Australia. Other named targets include ministers from the time who are now possible candidates in next year&apos;s Indonesian presidential election, and the first lady, Kristiani Herawati, better known as Ani Yudhoyono. When a separate document from Snowden, a former contractor to the US&apos;s National Security Agency (NSA), showed Australia had spied on Indonesia and other countries from its embassies, the Indonesian foreign minister, Marty Natalegawa, reacted angrily and threatened to review co-operation on issues crucial to Australia such as people smuggling and terrorism. The revelation strained a bilateral relationship already under pressure over the Abbott government&apos;s policy to \u201cturn back\u201d boats of asylum seekers coming to Australia. The new leak, published jointly by Guardian Australia and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, reveals the specific top-level targets and is likely to seriously escalate those tensions. The leaked material is a slide presentation, marked top secret, from the Australian Department of Defence and the Defence Signals Directorate, or DSD, (now called the Australian Signals Directorate), dealing with the interception of mobile phones as 3G technology was introduced in Asia. It includes a slide titled Indonesian President Voice Intercept, dated August 2009 and another slide, titled IA Leadership Targets + Handsets, listing the president and the first lady as having Nokia E90-1s, Boediono as having a BlackBerry Bold 9000, as well as the type and make of the mobile phones held by the other targets. Also named as targets for the surveillance are Dino Patti Djalal, at the time the president&apos;s foreign affairs spokesman, who recently resigned as Indonesia&apos;s ambassador to the US and is seeking the candidacy in next year&apos;s presidential election for the president&apos;s embattled Democratic party, and Hatta Rajasa, now minister for economic affairs and possible presidential candidate for the National Mandate party. Hatta was at the time minister for transport and his daughter is married to the president&apos;s youngest son.     &nbsp;    A slide entitled Indonesian President Voice Intercept (August &apos;09), shows a call from an unknown number in Thailand to Yudhoyono. But the call did not last long enough for the DSD to fulfil its aims. \u201cNil further info at this time (didn\u2019t make the dev threshold \u2013 only a sub-1minute call),\u201d a note at the bottom says. Another slide, titled Indonesian President Voice Events, has a graphic of calls on Yudhoyono&apos;s Nokia handset over 15 days in August 2009. It plots CDRs \u2013 call data records \u2013 which record the numbers called and calling a phone, the duration of calls, and whether it was a voice call or SMS. The agency, in what is standard procedure for surveillance, appears to have expanded its operations to include the calls of those who had been in touch with the president. Another slide, entitled Way Forward, states an imperative: \u201cMust have content.\u201d     &nbsp;    Also on the list of \u201cIA Leadership Targets\u201d are: \u2022 Jusuf Kalla, the former vice-president who ran as the Golkar party presidential candidate in 2009. \u2022 Sri Mulyani Indrawati, then a powerful and reforming finance minister and since 2010 one of the managing directors of the World Bank Group. \u2022 Andi Mallarangeng, a former commentator and television host who was at the time the president&apos;s spokesman, and who was later minister for youth and sports before resigning amid corruption allegations. \u2022 Sofyan Djalil, described on the slide as a \u201cconfidant\u201d, who until October 2009 was minister for state-owned enterprises. \u2022 Widodo Adi Sucipto, a former head of the Indonesian military who was until October 2009 security minister. Asked about the previous revelations about the embassies, Tony Abbott emphasised that they occurred during the administration of the former Labor government, that Australia&apos;s activities were not so much \u201cspying\u201d as \u201cresearch\u201d and that its intention would always be to use any information \u201cfor good\u201d. The prime minister has repeatedly insisted Australia&apos;s relationship with Indonesia is \u201cgood and getting better\u201d. Boediono said during his visit to Australia \u2013 before being revealed as an intended target of Australia&apos;s surveillance \u2013 that the Indonesian public was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the spying allegations. \u201cI think we must look forward to come to some arrangement which guarantees that intelligence information from each side is not used against the other,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be a system.\u201d At the bottom of each slide in the 2009 presentation is the DSD slogan: \u201cReveal their secrets \u2013 protect our own.\u201d The DSD is credited with supplying the information. Yudhoyono now joins his German, Brazilian and Mexican counterparts as leaders who have been monitored by a member of Five Eyes, the collective name for the surveillance agencies of the US, Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, who share information. Germany, Brazil and Mexico have all protested to the US over the infringement of privacy by a country they regarded as friendly. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, reacted with outrage to the revelation that her personal mobile phone had been tapped by the US, calling President Barack Obama to demand an explanation. The US eventually assured the chancellor that her phone was \u201cnot currently being tapped and will not be in the future\u201d. The Australian slide presentation, dated November 2009, deals with the interception of 3G mobile phones, saying the introduction of 3G in south-east Asia was nearly complete and providing dates for 3G rollout in Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Talking about future plans, the Australian surveillance service says it \u201cmust have content\u201d and be able to read encrypted messages, which would require acquiring the keys that would unlock them. Other documents from Snowden show the intelligence agencies have made huge inroads in recent years in finding ways into encrypted messages.     &nbsp;    One of the slides, entitled DSD Way Forward, acknowledges that the spy agency\u2019s resources are limited compared with its US and British counterparts. It says there is a \u201cneed to capitalise on UKUSA and industry capability\u201d, apparently a reference to the help provided \u2013 willingly or under pressure \u2013 from telecom and internet companies. The slides canvass &quot;options&quot; for continued surveillance and the final slide advises: \u201cChoose an option and apply it to a target (like Indonesian leadership).\u201d The tension between Australia and Indonesia began in October when documents revealed by the German newspaper Der Spiegel and published by Fairfax newspapers revealed that Australian diplomatic posts across Asia were being used to intercept phone calls and data. The Guardian then revealed that the DSD worked alongside America\u2019s NSA to mount a massive surveillance operation in Indonesia during a UN climate change conference in Bali in 2007. But these earlier stories did not directly involve the president or his entourage. Abbott made his first international trip as prime minister to Indonesia and has repeatedly emphasised the crucial importance of the bilateral relationship. Speaking after his meeting with Boediono last week, Abbott said: &quot;All countries, all governments gather information. That&apos;s hardly a surprise. It&apos;s hardly a shock. &quot;We use the information that we gather for good, including to build a stronger relationship with Indonesia and one of the things that I have offered to do today in my discussions with the Indonesian vice-president is to elevate our level of information-sharing because I want the people of Indonesia to know that everything, everything that we do is to help Indonesia as well as to help Australia. Indonesia is a country for which I have a great deal of respect and personal affection based on my own time in Indonesia.&quot; Asked about the spying revelations in a separate interview, Abbott said: &quot;To use the term spying, it&apos;s kind of loaded language \u2026 researching maybe. Talking to people. Understanding what&apos;s going on.&quot; On Monday a spokesman for Abbott said: &quot;Consistent with the long-standing practice of Australian governments, and in the interest of national security, we do not comment on intelligence matters.&quot; It remains unclear exactly who will contest next year&apos;s Indonesian presidential election, in which Yudhoyono, having already served two terms, is not eligible to stand. Based on recent polling, the popular governor of Jakarta, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, and former general Prabowo Subianto would be frontrunners."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/20/questions-royal-mail-sale-post-office", "sentences": ["Will the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Singapore be more interested in long-term investment in it \u2013 the government&apos;s justification for the sale \u2013 or in the more usual short-term share dealing?"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-20T10:49:51Z", "title": "Royal Mail's flawed sale bodes badly for the Post Office | Lindsay Mackie", "tags": ["Royal Mail", "Postal service", "UK news", "Business", "Privatisation", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Stock markets", "Post Office", "Trade unions"], "article": "Today MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee will have the chance to quiz Goldman Sachs and UBS about whether or not the advice they gave the government on the sale value of Royal Mail was sound, or so wrong that it came close to negligence. And customers across the country wanting to use the 373 crown post offices will find them closed this afternoon because of strike action. The two events are closely related. They are taking place because of fears that both institutions are being so badly handled that their futures are in jeopardy. Take Royal Mail. It&apos;s now a truism that it was undervalued. Shares sold for 330p are now selling at 550p \u2013 a total difference in market valuation of a stonking \u00a32.2bn. That&apos;s money the taxpayer missed out on. But there are more pressing questions about Royal Mail&apos;s future. Will the sovereign wealth funds of Abu Dhabi, Kuwait and Singapore be more interested in long-term investment in it \u2013 the government&apos;s justification for the sale \u2013 or in the more usual short-term share dealing? Will they forgo rising dividends in the interests of new technology for the British postal service? The chatter around the sale was remarkably light on the &quot;need for private investment in Royal Mail&quot; (the government&apos;s mantra since 2010) and rather more concerned with share value. And the future? One quoted market commentator highlighted the attractive takeover value of Royal Mail: &quot;If things don&apos;t work out on an independent basis, then it [Royal Mail] would look very cosy in the portfolio of UBS or Deutsche Bank.&quot; The other big unanswered question of the sale concerns the Royal Mail relationship with the Post Office. A third of the Post Office&apos;s income comes from dealing with the mail, with Royal Mail. There&apos;s a 10-year agreement that this shall continue. But there is chatter that big investors might come to tire of it \u2013 and what then? Today&apos;s Post Office strike \u2013 taking place in less comfortable conditions than the parliamentary hearing \u2013 mirrors the anxieties about the future of the great institution of Royal Mail. The Post Office will have to do without any public money from 2015. Post Office Ltd has to bridge a gap of around \u00a337m in its crown network (the post offices owned and run by Post Office Ltd rather than by the independent sub-postmasters) and to do this it has embarked on a further cost-cutting exercise. It wants to franchise 70 crown offices to the likes of WH Smith and Yogi Eyecare. (And WH Smith is now advertising jobs on the minimum wage of \u00a36.31 an hour where PO employees don&apos;t want to relocate.) It wants to lose 600 jobs elsewhere through automation. There is a three-year pay freeze on all employees (though not on the salaries of senior Post Office executives). To the unions it looks like a popular public service being run down. When the government began preparations to sell off Royal Mail, Ed Davey, then the relevant minister, played up the future of a post office safe in public hands. It got a big five-year investment sum. It was to be the &quot;front office of government&quot;, both national and local. It was to be encouraged to grow its financial services. That was 2010. Today we know that government services, which brought in \u00a3209m in 2009/10, only brought in \u00a3164m in 2012/13. Financial services revenue also dropped substantially (though rose again by 6% last year) in the same period. Sub-postmasters in the 11,500 post office branches are having a horrible time \u2013 their income has dropped by up to a third in the last five years. The National Federation of SubPostmasters is desperately worried about its members&apos; ability to stay in business, citing the 50% cut in pay rates for DVLA transactions (and Post Office Ltd&apos;s \u00a315m bonus payments). There has been no will or push in government to help the Post Office become a &quot;front office&quot; for anything. Today&apos;s select committee should ask whether the money from Royal Mail&apos;s sale \u2013 however much or little \u2013 will benefit the company in the future, and how. Customers faced with strikers should ask exactly what the future holds for the Post Office they trust and use."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2013/nov/20/changing-media-summit-2014-supporters-and-partners", "sentences": ["Founded in 2006, the company is headquartered in New York, with 14 offices globally, including the U.S., U.K., Israel, Brazil, Singapore, and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-20T13:56:00Z", "title": "Changing Media Summit 2014 supporters and partners", "tags": [], "article": "Thanks to the below organisations that are working with us to make sure the 2014 summit takes place.

Investing in a formal system of professional development for classroom teachers, and asking them to take responsibility for running it, would be a highly effective and non-confrontational way to improve school standards. Support that enables qualified teachers to enhance their pedagogical skills, their understanding of learning and child development and their subject knowledge within a culture of continuous improvement will raise the quality of teaching and pupil outcomes, and is common to the great education systems of the world. This includes Singapore where teachers are expected to engage in 100 hours of professional development every year. In England, the picture is very different. In contrast to other professions, like law, accountancy and medicine, there is currently no expectation that teachers should undertake a structured programme of certified and accredited career-long continuous professional development or CPD. Looking at the state of teacher CPD in England can be a depressing experience. The most ubiquitous CPD activity across English schools continues to be the five contractual Inset (in-service training) whole-school training days. These were introduced in 1988 as part of Kenneth Baker&apos;s school reforms and they are probably the last remaining unreformed element of that early package of changes. Research shows however that when teachers return to their classrooms after an Inset day only 7% of schools check to see if there is any effect on student attainment. It is not surprising, then, that barely 1% of training has been found to be transforming classroom practice. It is strange that the government has paid so little attention to reforming this area. It has chosen instead to focus on raising the quality of the 37,000 new teachers that enter the profession each year and on dealing with the lowest performing teachers through performance management and capability arrangements. These are important initiatives, but are dwarfed by the impact that a more coherent strategy for constantly improving the other talented 400,000 teachers could have in our schools. But actually the government&apos;s approach presents a tremendous opportunity for the teaching profession to take this challenge on and for individual teachers to take more personal responsibility as professionals, for undertaking the professional development they require. As we argue in a new CentreForum report, the first step here will be getting the teaching profession to sign up to the aim of developing its own system of post initial teacher training qualifications, CPD obligations and revalidation or recertification processes. A Royal College of Teaching is not essential for this to happen but would be the most obvious body to oversee the process. Every teacher should have a their own bespoke individual CPD plan. But so that this was not seen as part of performance management, schools would need to satisfy themselves that such a plan existed for each of their employees while stepping back from approving the plan&apos;s content. A Royal College of Teaching, subject associations, teaching school alliances and universities could all provide support for teachers in understanding their training needs and how best to meet them. The introduction of specialist school-based teaching and learning staff and departments is also worthy of further investigation. Another body with a key role is the Education Endowment Fund, which alongside funding and publishing high-quality research, could take on the role of supporting teachers in the application of research into classroom practice. To support this new CPD regime, schools should pilot a system where teachers have access to a budget to contribute towards the training costs involved and an allocation of time in which to undertake this training. In the same way that the education system has been reformed over recent years to give schools high levels of autonomy within which to deliver the high standards of pupil outcomes, so teachers should equally be able to expect high levels of professional autonomy, including over their professional development, in return for delivering high quality of teaching and learning in the classroom.

Indeed much of the Smart City World Expo on show in Barcelona does little to dispel that. Among the exhibits you can ride an electric bike, sit in the latest electric car models and even talk to a robot assistant. What relevance can any of this have for the developing world? Pieter van Heyningen, programmes manager from the Stellenbosch Innovation District (SID) in South Africa said: &quot;Smart cities are very much a developed world concept. When we look at the criteria for smart cities we talk about smart governments, smart healthcare, smart buildings, smart mobility, smart infrastructure, smart technology. A recent report suggested this is a $3.3tn (\u00a32tn) market opportunity. That&apos;s huge. But if we look at the map of investments on a global scale in terms of clean technology, Africa doesn&apos;t feature.&quot; The World Bank&apos;s Chris Vein, chief innovation officer for global information and communications, shared his concern. &quot;There is a saying &apos;the future is here, it&apos;s just not evenly distributed yet&apos;. I think on behalf of our clients at the World Bank that is especially true. Cities in the developing world are all striving for economic growth and improved living conditions, but their capacity to do so varies wildly.&quot; Both van Heyningen and Vein were able to offer some answers too, with examples of how the smart city concept could adapt to the developing world. Stellenbosch, a small town 20 miles outside of Cape Town, aims to become a &quot;smart test town&quot;. One initiative to tackle inadequate slum housing, a SID collaboration with the local university, has built &quot;smart shacks&quot; \u2013 easy to assemble fire-proof homes that produce off-grid energy via roof-mounted solar panels. &quot;You can also buy electricity through your mobile phone&quot;, Van Heyningen said. &quot;These do-it-yourself shacks range from $500 to $1000 depending on how much energy you require. A battery also charges in the day, and at night you can use it inside the shack to charge your cell phone.&quot; His town is also trialing electronic hubs with downloadable education resources, and large-scale solar farms. &quot;This is how we see smart technology arising in the African continent,&quot; he said. Vein said there was an initiative to monitor rapid urbanisation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which combines up-skilling local students with utilising smart technology. &quot;We gave them access to tablet computers, trained them on OpenStreetMap, and let them go out into the slum and actually map the slum. For the first time the government and the city actually had a visual of what that slum looked like and what its needs were in terms of the people and the infrastructure. For the first time, the government could actually see what it was dealing with.&quot; This project also highlighted the potential for technology to boost economic development. The students involved in the project have since formed a start-up, selling their services back to the government and the private sector. The situation faced by developing countries in the global east is different. Amitabh Kant is chief executive of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation, a project to link up the two cities and effectively create seven new greenfield cities in the process. &quot;Our challenge is very different \u2013 India is going to see a huge urbanisation, the latest McKinsey study says by the year 2030 we will have 350 million [more] Indians getting into the process of urbanisation, by 2050, 700 million&quot;, Kant said. &quot;Therefore the challenge is not to repeat the mistakes of what has been done in America \u2013 cities like Atlanta where 98% of people travel by car \u2013 it is important that countries like India set the example of compact, dense cities which are sustainable for the people.&quot; &quot;A better use of technology could help countries such as India make a quantum jump forward,&quot; Kant added. &quot;An advantage the developing world has over the developed world is being unencumbered by aging infrastructure that needs to be rebuilt \u2013 a lot can be built from scratch, and built better.&quot; &quot;Most of the lessons from smart cities don&apos;t come from the western part of the world, they come from the east&quot;, continued Kant. &quot;They come from Yokkaichi in Japan, [once] the most polluted city in the world. Today everything is recycled; Singapore recycles its water and waste very effectively; Yokohama has brought down about 39% of its waste and saved $4bn. Late starters have an advantage and they must seize that advantage to create a sustainable planet for tomorrow.&quot; &quot;I was recently in Kigali, Rwanda&quot;, said Vein. &quot;It was an amazing thing to see the presidents of six countries in that part of the world all say that their future depends on ICT or technology being core to the delivery of the systems, products and services that they provide.&quot; This he said, was a sea change for the region and the development community at large. Examples of smart cities emerging from the developing world may not grab the same headlines as the flashier tech cities such as Barcelona, but it is time we started paying closer attention to their importance for development.

There was a little surprise in Thohir&apos;s native Indonesia, where the billionaire is much more of a court-side than pitch-side presence. His investment company has shares in one of the country&apos;s leading football clubs, Persib Bandung, but he is a much more visible supporter of the all-conquering Satria Muda team he owns. Basketball, it is generally agreed, is the media magnate&apos;s love; football is business pure and simple. There is nothing pure and simple about football in Indonesia. Since the Soviet Union built the Gelora Bung Karno stadium in 1962 people have tended to take, not give. The Jakarta arena has, when full, the best atmosphere in Asia, rivalled only by Tehran&apos;s Azadi. While this face of Indonesian football can take one&apos;s breath away, so can what happens out of view. In the bowels of the stadium are the brown windowless offices of the country&apos;s football association, PSSI, linked by quiet windowless corridors where footsteps echo on the shiny wooden floor. From here over the years the stench of corruption and more besides has pumped out to all corners of this vast archipelago. There are no guarantees that even with the best governance Indonesia would not have lost 1-0 in China on Friday but the Merah Putih (red and whites) would have had a better chance. It is also less likely that they would have all but crashed out of qualification for the 2015 Asian Cup with a third of the group games still to play \u2013 one point from four games, albeit in a tough group, says it all. The 2012 ASEAN Cup \u2013 a regional tournament that Indonesia has never won, unlike tiny Singapore with its four titles \u2013 ended at the group stage. Much is written about how China struggles in football but the Middle Kingdom is far ahead of Indonesia, the fourth most populous nation in the world. Recent Chinese success at club level has come as investment followed a clean-up of the league. Indonesian fans are not holding their breath. A senior official at PSSI admitted in May that there were major issues after it was fined $15,000 by the Asian Football Confederation for the latest in a series of crowd disturbances at international games. &quot;Football management in Indonesia is in such a mess at the moment. We aren&apos;t able to do anything about things like this,&quot; said the spokesman Rudolf Yesayas. &quot;We have much bigger problems.&quot; Those include deadlier levels of violence that can be evidenced in the domestic leagues \u2013 during the big game between Persija Jakarta and Persib Bandung in May 2012 three fans were killed \u2013 but there is plenty more besides as the country is still trying to recover from years of infighting, incompetence, corruption and cronyism. The low point came in 2005. The reputation of Nurdin Halid, the PSSI president, was not high even before he was sent down for the first of two prison sentences on charges of corruption. Fifa seemed to care little about enforcing its own rules about criminals or politicians (he was also a member of a major national party) running national associations and Nurdin continued to hold office while in his cell. Though the &apos;Jakarta Joker&apos; was finally deposed in 2011, his legacy lives on. Eventually the opposition took power of PSSI and, while the de-Nurdin-ification started (though an increasing number of the old boy&apos;s supporters are back in positions of influence), the politics did not stop. The national team coach Alfred Riedl was popular with players and public \u2013 during his time in charge of Vietnam more than 80 fans came forward in 2007 offering to donate a kidney on hearing that the Austrian needed a transplant \u2013 but in the first act of the new regime he was fired. By this time there were two federations with two different leagues. Players who left clubs in the official competition to join the rebels were banned by Fifa. A 10\u20130 thrashing in 2012 at the hands of Bahrain in a qualifier for the Brazil World Cup prompted accusations of match-fixing. Whether foul play was involved or not, this was a demotivated D-team even if the humiliation was A-grade. In China foreign players have just helped Guangzhou Evergrande become champions of Asia but in Indonesia many imports play with virtual visas, promised but never forthcoming, and phantom pay packets. So numerous are those agents, players and coaches owed money by Indonesian clubs that there have been discussions as to whether to start a Facebook group. The Indonesia striker Bambang Pamungkas, who stated in March that the country&apos;s football was dying, helped to form a players&apos; union in 2012, claiming that 60% of his fellow professionals faced late payment issues \u2013 a report in The Times alleged that the total amount owed to players was more than $6m. Bambang has still not been paid almost a year later and, if it can happen to the country&apos;s biggest star \u2013 Indonesia&apos;s golden boy with almost five million Twitter followers \u2013 then what chance do the rest have? The tragic story of Diego Mendieta made headlines around the world last December when the Paraguayan died alone in hospital. He was unable to leave or afford medical treatment after his club had stopped paying him. In a decade of lows that was the lowest but there is always hope. The Under-19 team recently defeated South Korea 3-2 in qualification for the 2014 Asian Championship to send a Jakarta crowd of 50,000 and a nation wild with delight. Some of the near 70m people in the country under the age of 14 are crying out for a little of the youth development system that the Koreans, who hardly noticed the defeat, take for granted. That passion means that the politicians will always find the game attractive. For Indonesian fans the major event of 2014 is not the World Cup \u2013 the 1938 appearance in the guise of Dutch East Indies, the first ever by an Asian nation, is not looking like being repeated any time in the near future \u2013 but the presidential election. As they say, &quot;Control football and you are on your way to controlling Indonesia.&quot; There is not much evidence of anyone controlling anything at the moment and, until that happens, such as Thohir cannot really be blamed if they look to spend their money overseas."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/nov/22/international-development-journalism-competition-finalists", "sentences": ["Click here to read Sophie McBain&apos;s article Susie Sell      Susie is currently a freelance journalist having worked for trade publications in England and Singapore for several years."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-22T10:12:00Z", "title": "International Development Journalism Competition finalists", "tags": ["International Development Journalism competition"], "article": "\u2022 Nishtha Chugh\u2022 Meral Duzgun\u2022 Stevie Greenleaf\u2022 Joanna Griffin\u2022 Helen Kearney\u2022 Sophie McBain\u2022 Susie Sell\u2022 Sarah Shearman\u2022 Ben Thurman\u2022 Louise Tickle\u2022 James Wan\u2022 Boel Marcks von W\u00fcrtemberg Nishtha Chugh      Nishtha is a journalist by mission and storyteller by heart.

The mother breastfed her small baby as she told me of their sadness about their daughter&apos;s situation. The little girl came and sat on my lap. Rubbish and sewage washed along the street just outside as the rain kept coming.

It was therefore an indicator more of a country&apos;s geo-political stance rather than its level of development. Notwithstanding the inherent limitations of such a broad brush typology, it nevertheless described the reality of a very large part of the globe. It was also progressive \u2013 here were newly independent countries articulating not only an independence of political thinking, but also refusing to be sucked into the dangerous spiral of the cold war driven by two superpowers. While usage of first world and second world was always minimal, third world did garner traction. Gradually, however, there began to be an unease with the term in that it had connotations of &quot;third class&quot; . In the post-colonial era, it was not considered politically correct to use such terms, especially by those in the former colonial powers. Accordingly, alternatives \u2013 not least in academia \u2013 such as &quot;developing countries&quot;, or &quot;the global south&quot; or even just &quot;the south&quot; began to take preference. Certainly, with the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet bloc \u2013 and with it the loss of the original rationale for using second world \u2013 it seemed that third world would also be made redundant. This has not been the case. Indeed, the term is still used quite frequently in its economic sense, that is, the level of a country&apos;s economic development and standard living as evidenced by GDP per capita. Moreover, many third world countries, especially in east Asia, have forged ahead with development and were accorded a new epithet, newly industrialising countries (Nics). In the development sense, these would now better be described as being part of the second world. They are no longer in the third world, but most are not yet in the first world either. And the old Soviet bloc countries can also fit within this grouping. In my experience as a longstanding academic, I have found little discomfort in the use of third world by students and academics from the developing world. In the same vein, last year, in an interview with Channel 4 News, Barack Obama&apos;s Kenyan half-brother was asked what he thought was the key difference between himself and Obama. He replied quickly that Obama was from the first world and he from the third world. Similarly, in his 2011 book on the modern history of Singapore, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew makes use of the terminology by using the title From Third World to First to highlight the astonishing transformation of a small impoverished country into a modern state with one of the world&apos;s highest living standards. So there is some evidence to suggest that, despite the unease from some quarters, the term third world still has some mileage left when used to refer to countries that are relatively poor with low levels of development. But it is interesting to consider whether the term first world ought to be applied to some countries that have attained very high levels of income per capita. I am thinking of the Gulf states in particular. The World Bank&apos;s world development indicators for 2012 shows that Qatar had the third highest GDP per capita at $83,000; UAE had the 16th highest at $42,000; Saudi Arabia 29th at $32,000. In 2011 Kuwait had the 10th highest at $45,000, with Oman and Bahrain a little further back at $26,000 and $25,000 respectively. All these have a GDP per capita which would suggest that they are part of the first world. However, in the IMF&apos;s country categories, none of the Gulf Cooperation Council GCC states comes within other advanced economies (which exclude the G7 and euro area countries). Rather, they all fall within the highly disparate grouping of Middle East, north Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Yet South Korea, which has a GDP per capita slightly lower than Saudi Arabia&apos;s, is considered an advanced economy. Has the IMF got it wrong? Surely the GCC states should also be included in this exalted grouping? There are good reasons to think not: putting it somewhat euphemistically, these countries have quite some way to go. Judging countries solely by GDP per capita is a blunt measure of categorisation. While it might be a necessary criterion, it is certainly not a sufficient one. GCC Human Rights, a campaign group highlighting the plight of migrant workers in the Gulf provides clear reasons for this. It reported: &quot;In GCC countries non-white ethnic groups experience blatant discrimination ... [they] consistently deny immigrant workers the same rights enjoyed by their own citizens.&quot; GCC Human Rights website provides evidence of the most appalling abuse of human rights of non-white migrants, including systematic brutalisation and torture, which was also recently highlighted by the Guardian and Amnesty International. Their mission statement concludes with these words: &quot;Persuade the GCC countries to treat immigrant workers with the respect that is due them, remove all discrimination against them, and acknowledge them as first-class citizens \u2013 by doing so, these nations will become great.&quot; What constitutes countries becoming &quot;great&quot; is highly contentious but if and when the GCC countries grant international norms of human rights to the large numbers of migrants within their ranks, then their eligibility to join the ranks of the first world can be considered. Currently though, despite their stellar GDP per capita, they are better considered as part of the third world \u2013 and there should be no unease at the derogatory meaning attached in this context. \u2022 Dr Rumy Hasan is a senior lecturer in the SPRU (Science and Technology Policy Research) department at the University of Sussex"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/nov/22/famous-world-hotels-quiz-answers", "sentences": ["Stop for a cocktail in one of the city&apos;s best speakeasy bars  Image seven: Marina Bay Sands, SingaporeFancy a trip?"], "publicationDate": "2013-11-22T17:46:00Z", "title": "How many of these famous world hotels do you know?

With the media running hot, breathlessly reporting every syllable of outrage it can find in Jakarta, it\u2019s easy to believe that this is the biggest crisis we\u2019ve ever faced and that it will take years to repair the damage. As Indonesia has withdrawn its ambassador and downgraded military and intelligence cooperation in the wake of the Snowden eavesdropping revelations, it\u2019s unsurprising that Tony Abbott has put other issues on hold while he tries to deal with the fallout. But a bit of perspective at this stage can be refreshing. This is not the greatest diplomatic crisis to face Australia \u2013 not even close. It\u2019s not even the greatest crisis to beset Australia-Indonesian relations. Far from it \u2013 Australia\u2019s bilateral relations with its northern neighbours have historically been crisis-prone, as have bilateral relations among those neighbours. Diplomatic spats are part of the landscape in our part of the world. 20 years ago, then prime minister Paul Keating upset his Malaysian counterpart by suggesting that those leaders who had not attended the first APEC Leaders\u2019 Summit were \u201crecalcitrants\u201d. His successor, John Howard, angered Beijing by voicing his support for the dispatch of US Navy aircraft carrier groups to the Taiwan Straits in the face of hostile missile launches by the Chinese in a bid to intimidate Taiwan\u2019s first Presidential election. Australia and Indonesia almost came to blows during the East Timor intervention in 1999, and in 2001, then president Megawati Sukarnoputri refused to take phone calls from Howard over an asylum-seeker stand-off. Kevin Rudd faced his own crisis with China over his \u201cZhengyou\u201d speech in Beijing, and with Indonesia over the Oceanic Viking. There\u2019s one lesson to be drawn from all of these crises: that despite their occurrence, relations were quickly restored to a pragmatic, balanced mean. Given the sound and the fury at the time, it\u2019s astonishing how quickly each storm passed, and positive relations restored. Just five years after Australian troops led an intervention into East Timor, and three after Megawati refused to take phone calls, Howard and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono\u00a0spontaneously embraced \u2013 with genuine mutual affection \u2013 on the sidelines of an APEC meeting. The reason is that the big strategic forces in the region are bringing the interests of Australia and its Southeast Asian neighbours closer and closer together. Despite their occasional spats, there is an underlying realisation that Australia and the countries of Southeast Asia need each other, and are gradually developing their solidarity amidst the great forces taking place around them. What are these strategic forces? Simply put, they are the contradictory forces of growing economic interdependence and rising security rivalries among the region\u2019s great powers: China, the US, Japan and India. Their rivalries mean that they can\u2019t build genuine collaboration around their economic linkages; their interdependence means their rivalry can never be resolved by all-out war. Instead, they have begun to compete for the loyalties of smaller countries in this crucial region that separates the world\u2019s two most important oceans: the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. As a result, the dilemmas and pressures faced by Australia in maintaining positive relations among the great powers are shared by all of the other states of Southeast Asia. There is genuine concern that countries such as Laos and Cambodia appear to have thrown in their lot with Beijing, as well as some discomfort that the Philippines has been gradually building its expectations of American support for its confrontations with China in the South China Sea. Amidst this background tension, Australia and Indonesia \u2013 and Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, etc \u2013 have a real interest that their neighbours maintain a pragmatic balance between the jealous great powers.\u00a0 Then why the outrage in Jakarta? Both Yudhoyono\u00a0and his foreign minister are sensitive to criticisms that they\u2019re been too pro-western in their policies and attitudes. What they didn\u2019t bank on was the media\u2019s serial exploitation of the Snowden revelations, stirring the nationalist pot just when the first phase of the crisis had begun to die down, with Yudhoyono\u00a0and Natelagawa probably feeling they\u2019d hit just the right notes of anger. One gets the feeling that the outrage has somewhat slipped the noose of what they had expected or were comfortable with, and that the crisis has assumed a life of its own. The take-out message for the Abbott government? This too, will pass. The structural forces are all aligned behind a restoration of pragmatic and close Indonesia-Australia relations."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/nov/25/4g-small-businesses", "sentences": ["4G allows Mason to maintain a highly personal service to clients as far flung as New York and Singapore.", "&quot;I&apos;m bound to be losing business in London when I am in New York, and in New York when I am in Singapore, so what I&apos;m really trying to do is digitise myself."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-25T10:21:51Z", "title": "Is four the magic number for small businesses?", "tags": ["Efficiency", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Technology", "4G", "Business", "Small business"], "article": "The first signs are that 4G is opening up surprising new opportunities, especially for very small businesses that are big on ideas but have limited resources. Take street food entrepreneur Mark Gevaux, aka The Rib Man. He is using 4G mobile on his London market stalls to lure customers through social media, with live video feeds of the feasts he is serving up based on pork ribs and his own-recipe hot chilli sauces. Gevaux, a butcher by trade, took to the street markets five years ago selling fresh racks of meat. He had lost his leg in a car accident and his employers could no longer insure him. Working the farmers&apos; markets at Brick Lane and King&apos;s Cross gave him a new lease of life. To show punters how good the meat was, he began cooking samples on a disposable barbeque and soon realised he had a whole new opportunity in front of him. &quot;People wanted to eat the pork there and then,&quot; Gevaux says. &quot;Now we sell more rib meat in rolls than we do fresh racks.&quot; The problem with cooking food is that it needs to be used up the same day, which makes stock planning a delicate art. It is here that 4G has been invaluable. A keen user of social media to build public awareness of his stalls, Gevaux says his Twitter following, now 9,000-strong, has been growing at a rate of 1,000 a month since moving to 4G. Instead of just telling people where he is and what he&apos;s doing, he can post a video link and let the food do the talking. He says: &quot;The other day I saw how much meat I had left with just half an hour to go, so I posted some images and within five minutes I had a long queue of people who&apos;d seen the tweet.&quot; 4G also allows Gevaux to manage his growing online business from the kerb. His sauce has been such a hit that he now sells it via the web. Before, he had to do this from home, waiting until he had a critical mass of orders before he made a batch to send out. Now he can respond to orders in real time from his stall, printing off labels and posting out bottles as part of his market-day routine. &quot;I&apos;ve gained a whole day back in the week as a result,&quot; he adds. Business is booming too. Before he signed up to 4G, the most meat Gevaux sold in a week was about 400kg. This year, in the peak summer season, he was averaging a metric ton of ribs across three to four markets. &quot;4G has helped double my business,&quot; he says. &quot;The fact that I can get to so many people so quickly, tell them where I&apos;ll be and show them what I&apos;ll be doing is incredibly powerful. Even before customers have left the house I am creating demand.&quot; As well as boosting sales, Gevaux is also taking less risk with stock. For example, he is now one step ahead of the weather. &quot;I have a live satellite feed so I can see the clouds moving in,&quot; he explains. &quot;Sudden rain can clear a market, and a couple of bad days can soon wipe out your profits. But this doesn&apos;t happen now as I can track the weather right up to the minute.&quot; If dark clouds are gathering, he can step up his customer promotions in real time to shift stock quickly. Other tactics include streaming live sports matches on the stall and offering a free rib meat roll or bottle of sauce to customers who correctly predict the result. All of this has helped create the buzz around Gevaux&apos;s &apos;Rib Man&apos; brand. Last year he was named Honorary Young British Foodie for his smoky pork ribs. Perhaps the biggest measure of his success is that Gevaux has raised the \u00a310,000 he needed to start up his own kitchen \u2013 through the crowdfunding portal Kickstarter. Here, large numbers of individuals pledge a modest personal investment in projects they believe will offer them a good return. This achievement owes a lot to The Rib Man&apos;s social media profile. Gevaux&apos;s take up of 4G was prompted by EE, the first network provider licensed to roll out 4G in the UK. Earlier this year it targeted five &apos;future creators&apos; from a list of 300 potential businesses to be ambassadors for its 4G services. Each was awarded 4GEE kit to the value of \u00a33,000 to see what new business growth and opportunities it could unlock. Another entrepreneur selected for the challenge was David Mason. To mark James Bond&apos;s 50th anniversary he recently revived Anthony Sinclair, the London-based bespoke tailoring business responsible for Sean Connery&apos;s suits during his years playing 007. He has also developed a made-to-measure arm to the business, which is expected to drive a large proportion of the firm&apos;s growth. 4G allows Mason to maintain a highly personal service to clients as far flung as New York and Singapore. &quot;The challenge is how to manage our growth,&quot; he explains. &quot;80% of the business I get is by going to see customers face to face, so the aim is to make my time with clients more productive.&quot; 4G has allowed the firm to digitise documents, customer notes, and vast libraries of patterns and fabric samples, and access them via the cloud so that Mason can effectively carry his whole business around with him. Previously, Mason had to carry fabric samples and pattern books with him to meetings, risking a scenario where a client might ask to see something he didn&apos;t have with him. This happened in 20% of client meetings, resulting in a loss of business. With a high-resolution fabric library and complete pattern archive to hand, Mason is now more likely to close a sale and can even get an order into production before flying home. In the longer term, Mason would like to see clients have more influence over their own garments, calling up previous patterns and selecting their own fabrics using an online suit &apos;configurator&apos; app. &quot;I&apos;m bound to be losing business in London when I am in New York, and in New York when I am in Singapore, so what I&apos;m really trying to do is digitise myself. 4G makes that possible,&quot; he says.

Alain Prost, the four-time champion known as Formula One&apos;s &quot;Professor&quot; for his intellectual approach to the sport, appeared to praise Vettel as his successor, when he said: &quot;He is a great driver. You can see he is methodical in his approach and builds a strong team around him.&quot; 2 Romain Grosjean \u2013 Lotus The Frenchman could hardly represent a better commercial for the benefits of new fatherhood. He had so many accidents last year that he seemed more likely to make it as a stunt driver than as a genuine world championship contender, but that is exactly what he should be next season. He finished this year strongly with four podium finishes in the final six races. 3 Nico Hulkenberg \u2013 Sauber The driver on a number of wish-lists \u2013 Lotus and Force India have been falling over each other to sign him - it is astonishing that he went into the final race of the season without a confirmed drive for 2014. A serial overachiever in an unremarkable car, the German regularly made Q3 and was fourth in Korea. 4 Nico Rosberg \u2013 Mercedes This Leonardo DiCaprio lookalike is clearly determined to be nothing other than a leading man. He saw off Michael Schumacher, his previous team-mate at Mercedes, but that didn&apos;t stop people predicting that Lewis Hamilton would blow him away this year. But this highly intelligent driver has two wins to Hamilton&apos;s one, and has often out-qualified the Briton. 5 Valtteri Bottas \u2013 Williams When the departing Mark Webber was asked who would be replacing him as the maverick voice in the Formula One paddock he replied &quot;Bottas.&quot; He was being ironic. The Finn lets his driving do the talking for him. He looked superb in Texas at the US Grand Prix and one wonders what he might achieve within a bigger team. The real deal. 6 Kimi Raikkonen \u2013 Lotus The world&apos;s fastest unpaid driver at times this season, the Finn put Lotus&apos;s financial problems behind him to string together a sequence of eye-catching performances as he reproduced his often stunning comeback form of 2012. He was so impressive \u2013 at least until he got a bit sulky at the end when he threatened not to race due to the pay issue \u2013 that Ferrari, the team that paid him off in 2009, re-engaged him. Missed the final two races after a back operation. 7 Jules Bianchi \u2013 Marussia In an uncompetitive car, the Frenchman took the fight to Caterham as Marussia successfully battled for the financially important 10th place in the constructors&apos; championship. Beside a rookie sidekick in Max Chilton, he was often a strong and feisty team leader, and achieved a best placing of 13th in Malaysia. 8 Daniel Ricciardo \u2013Toro Rosso Always smiling, and always working very hard, the Aussie Toro Rosso driver&apos;s greatest achievement was to win the most coveted seat in F1, driving for Red Bull alongside Vettel next season. Red Bull thought long and hard about this, before rewarding the driver who finished seventh in China and Italy. 9 Lewis Hamilton \u2013 Mercedes Most people thought he was crazy to quit McLaren for Mercedes a year ago, but it proved to be an inspired move as he has formed part of a revival at the Arrows. Has not yet got a car that suits his style but he still pulled off five pole positions and a stunning win in Hungary. 10 Mark Webber \u2013 Red Bull The Australian provided another strong drive in Brazil in his final Formula One race to come second and pip Hamilton to third place in the drivers&apos; championship. In the end, Vetel made him look almost ordinary but Webber was better than that and he went out in style. 11 Max Chilton \u2013 Marussia An habitual back-marker \u2013 but not here \u2013 he has finished last on a dozen occasions. His best performance was 14th in Monaco \u2013 and even then he was last but one. But this affable Marussia driver also set a rookie record by finishing every race. Astonishingly, he was the only driver to do so, and at the end of the season the team wanted to keep him. 12 Fernando Alonso \u2013 Ferrari He looked a real title challenger when he won in China and Spain early in the season. And he remained wonderfully consistent, with nine podium finishes. But he also had a row with Ferrari and he didn&apos;t have a good enough car. The mid-season change of tyres appeared to cost him but, nevertheless, did not look quite as formidable as he has been. 13 Paul di Resta \u2013 Force India He looks destined to walk away from Formula One at the end of the season, as Force India settle for Adrian Sutil and maybe Sergio P\u00e9rez. This would be a disappointment because he has shown consistent pace all season. But the sport can be unfair like that and he does not bring in any money in terms of sponsorship. 14 Jenson Button \u2013 McLaren Has coasted a little in recent races, even though his fourth place in the final race pointed the way to better things in 2014. He was never pushed by his team-mate P\u00e9rez, although all that might change when the Kevin Magnussen joins next year from the team&apos;s driver-development programme. It will also help if he has a competitive car. 15 Felipe Massa \u2013 Ferrari Had some of his best drives after Ferrari had shown him the door. But the fact is that he has been living on borrowed time since his serious accident in 2009 reduced his ability to drive fast and made him settle for being Alonso&apos;s stooge. Could still be a good signing for Williams, though. 16 Adrian Sutil \u2013 Force India Was not dominated by his team-mate Di Resta as much as many anticipated. And he also brought some much needed money to the team. He faded in the second half of the season after being a regular single-digit finisher in the first half. But the mid-season tyre change did not suit Force India one bit. 17 Jean-Eric Vergne \u2013 Toro Rosso His best performance was his sixth place in Canada but it was no surprise when he lost out to Toro Rosso team-mate Ricciardo in terms of getting promotion to Red Bull next season. He made a weak finish to the season, with a 17th in Abu Dhabi, a 16th in Texas and a 15th in Brazil. If only the season had lasted a few more months. 18 Giedo van der Garde \u2013 Caterham Driving for Caterham can&apos;t have been too much fun but the 28-year-old Dutch rookie showed some pace on occasions and was 14th in Hungary. His best qualifying performance was his 14th in Belgium. Looked better than Charles Pic at the end of the day, and beating your team-mate is the first priority. 19 Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez \u2013 Sauber He had a difficult start to the season and never properly recovered. When he put it all together he proved he could be quick, at Suzuka for example, and he was also a top-10 qualifier in Singapore and Korea. But there were too many mistakes and he was a poor second to Hulkenberg at Sauber. 20 Sergio P\u00e9rez \u2013 McLaren He was given the opportunity of a lifetime, a drive with one of the biggest and best teams, and he blew it. On the surface he was unlucky to be shown the door by McLaren, because he was often quicker than the much more experienced Button. But the suggestion was that he had not fully embraced Formula One&apos;s work ethic and the feedback that he gave his team was poor. 21 Charles Pic \u2013 Caterham It has been a disappointing second season for the Frenchman. There have been silly mistakes, coming from a non-rookie, and he has not enamoured himself to his team either because the feedback has not been deemed good enough. A big disappointment, feeding rumours that he may not be around next year. 22 Pastor Maldonado \u2013 Williams He was regularly outperformed by his less experienced team-mate, Valtteri Bottas, and at the US Grand Prix he even accused his team of trying to sabotage his effort. Did not build on last year&apos;s maiden win and it may be just as well he has Venezuela&apos;s state oil company behind him. In the cash-strapped world of Formula One that makes him an asset. \u2022 Heikki Kovalainen is not included after driving in only two races in place of Kimi Raikkonen How they finished in the drivers&apos; championship Pos Driver Nationality Team Points 1 Sebastian Vettel German Red Bull Racing-Renault 397 2 Fernando Alonso Spanish Ferrari 242 3 Mark Webber Australian Red Bull Racing-Renault 199 4  Lewis Hamilton British Mercedes 189 5 Kimi Raikonnen Finnish Lotus-Renault 183 6 Nico Rosberg German Mercedes 171 7  Romain Grosjean French Lotus-Renault 132 8  Felipe Massa Brazilian Ferrari 112 9 Jenson Button British McLaren-Mercedes 73 10 Nico Hulkenberg German Sauber-Ferrari 51 11 Sergio Perez Mexican McLaren-Mercedes 49 12 Paul di Resta British Force India-Mercedes 48 13 Adrian Sutil German Force India-Mercedes 29 14 Daniel Ricciardo Australian STR-Ferrari 20 15 Jean-Eric Vergne French STR-Ferrari 13 16 Esteban Guti\u00e9rrez Mexican Sauber-Ferrari 6 17 Valtteri Bottas Finnish Williams-Renault 4 18 Pastor Maldonado Venezuelan Williams-Renault 1 19 Jules Bianchi French Marussia-Cosworth 0 20 Charles Pic French Caterham-Renault 0 21 Heikki Kovalainen Finnish Lotus-Renault 0 22 Giedo van der Garde Dutch Caterham-Renault 0 23  Max Chilton British Marussia-Cosworth 0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/nov/25/global-citizenship-teachers-creating", "sentences": ["Caroline Ferguson is an English teacher at an international school in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-25T18:00:00Z", "title": "What kind of global citizens are teachers creating?", "tags": ["Citizenship", "Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching"], "article": "Global citizenship education is a sociological experiment. Most schools promise to create global citizens or global leaders, but what kind of global citizen do we want to create? It&apos;s a blurred utopian vision. Do we want future citizens who feel a moral responsibility to respond to global crises or do we want to encourage a powerful global elite? The philosophy of cosmopolitanism underlies theories of global citizenship. Cosmopolitanism is the ability to balance a local and global identity. A cosmopolitan individual engages meaningfully with different cultures and feels at home in the world. There are two potentially conflicting types of cosmopolitanism. One is an ethical sense of responsibility and social justice to the earth and its inhabitants. The other is the practical economic potential you get from cultural awareness and cross-cultural ability. In the increasingly competitive worldwide environment, schools are expected to produce globally-competent students ready to take on the future economic world as we see it today. And cosmopolitan capital is evident in curriculums everywhere \u2013 Mandarin lessons and international field trips, for example, are designed to give students the edge in global awareness. The cultural understanding gained from these programmes is valuable. They are, however, expensive and exclusive, which is why cosmopolitan capital can be so dangerous. Not only is it only really available to young citizens who have access to these global opportunities, but because of this it can also reinforce social inequality rather than encouraging social mobility. In Asia and continental Europe, cosmopolitan striving has only served to enforce existing class structures. A push from the middle class to educate their children in English language medium international schools gives students the skills to vie for places in English-speaking universities, which improves their chances of future economic gain. Parents make a significant financial investment in choosing English as their child&apos;s academic language. Active global citizenship, on the other hand, is a moral interpretation of cosmopolitanism. The definition by Oxfam has been promoted as the foundation for ethical global citizenship education. According to Oxfam, an active global citizen understands &quot;how the world works\u2026 is outraged by social injustice&quot; and &quot;is willing to act to make the world a more sustainable place&quot;. It&apos;s important to acknowledge the political agenda behind this form of global citizenship. Active citizenship, as the name suggests, is based on action. But our understanding of this is based on our own cultural norms. For example, when you think of political action, do you assume the action takes place in a stable western democracy? What if the global citizen \u2013 your student \u2013 isn&apos;t living in a western democracy? Some forms of global citizenship action are simply not accepted in many countries and we need to ensure, as teachers, that our own preconceptions aren&apos;t influencing our subject and being passed onto our our students. Furthermore, in promoting active citizenship we can be in danger of creating an imagined world where the enlightened help those less globally aware. Active global citizenship is sometimes interpreted as charity or fundraising, but this isn&apos;t quite right. Active citizenship involves global political awareness and the impassioned advocacy for equality. Tracking how global citizenship is taught is tricky \u2013 it&apos;s often tackled across various subject curriculums and cosmopolitan capital and active global citizenship are often interwoven. Some curriculums attempt to walk a tightrope between the two agendas. For example, the international baccalaureate has a compulsory service component of active citizenship while including the social advantage of an internationally-recognised qualification (cosmopolitan capital). On the other hand, the English national curriculum key stage 3 and 4 has few statutory aspects of global awareness in the citizenship course beyond human rights, and active citizenship is only included at a local school and community level. and active citizenship is only included at a local school and community level. Australia has prioritised Asia literacy across subjects for regional understanding and cosmopolitan capital. Curriculums in fast-growth Asian countries make no excuse for encouraging cosmopolitan capital for the sake of national growth \u2013 everyone has to get along for economic expansion. Currently, schools choose what is taught and how. Curriculums are subject to individual school contexts and budgets allocated to global awareness. This arbitrary nature of global citizenship education demands attention. All students need equal access to cosmopolitan capital and opportunities for ethical global citizenship. Theories, philosophies and our own perspectives as teachers should be questioned rigorously as they inform the global citizenship that we teach and the future society that we shape. There are competing ideological aims and agendas in how we introduce the world to our students. If schools are indeed creating global citizens, let&apos;s be aware of the educational, political and social power that we wield.

Relations between Jakarta and Canberra were downgraded last week after revelations published by Guardian Australia and the ABC that Australian intelligence agencies had targeted Yudhoyono&apos;s personal mobile and those of his wife and inner circle. Yudhoyono said on Tuesday he would appoint a special envoy to draft and negotiate the new &quot;code of ethics&quot; between the two countries and added that he hoped Abbott would join him to sign the code in person once it had been agreed. &quot;When both countries, but particularly Indonesia, have regained trust and also when the protocol and code ethics are fully implemented, then we can continue mutual beneficial bilateral relations including military and police co-operation between the two countries,&quot; Yudhoyono said. Yudhoyono added that Abbott&apos;s letter had assured him that Australia would not take any action that &quot;disturbs and damages relations with Indonesia&quot;. Earlier, the president tweeted a photograph of himself reading a conciliatory letter from Abbott, which was hand delivered. But he laid out six steps before relations could be properly restored.

Yudhoyono had previously described Abbott&apos;s response to the phone tapping revelations as &quot;belittling&quot; after the prime minister refused to apologise. Abbott has refused to confirm or deny that the phone tapping took place. The president used the press conference to reassure Canberra that relations between Australia and Indonesia were &quot;in essence&quot; very good and had to be safeguarded. Yudhoyono acknowledged that the process of negotiating a new code of ethics might take time. &quot;It needs process of course, intensive discussion and diplomacy,&quot; he said. &quot;We will conduct it in the near future.&quot; Separately, Malaysia&apos;s foreign ministry summoned a senior Singaporean diplomat over allegations that the city state had helped the US and Australia tap telecommunications links in Asia for espionage. Singapore&apos;s government has not publicly responded to the allegations. The Malaysian foreign minister, Anifah Aman, said his ministry was seeking clarification from Singapore&apos;s high commissioner to Malaysia. &quot;If those allegations are eventually proven, it is certainly a serious matter that the government of Malaysia strongly rejects and abhors,&quot; Anifah said. He said spying against a good friend and neighbour was unacceptable."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/26/law-clifford-chance-royal-mail-property-portfolio", "sentences": ["It is not clear which client has engaged the law firm, but Clifford Chance has previously represented organisations including the Children&apos;s Investment Fund and GIC, Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, who are two of Royal Mail&apos;s largest shareholders."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-26T19:27:31Z", "title": "Law firm Clifford Chance analyses Royal Mail's property portfolio", "tags": ["Royal Mail", "Business", "Postal service", "UK news", "Real estate"], "article": "Clifford Chance, the &quot;Magic Circle&quot; City law firm with links to some of the leading investors in Royal Mail, has been privately analysing the newly floated company&apos;s portfolio of 2,000 UK properties. News of the evaluation comes a week after MPs on the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills select committee probed bankers on the value of the newly privatised company&apos;s property portfolio, amid criticisms that it may have been undervalued and that Royal Mail sold off on the cheap. Vince Cable and Michael Fallon, the ministers who led the controversial flotation, are set to appear in front of the committee on Wednesday. It is not clear which client has engaged the law firm, but Clifford Chance has previously represented organisations including the Children&apos;s Investment Fund and GIC, Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, who are two of Royal Mail&apos;s largest shareholders. The Guardian understands that Clifford Chance has received a report containing details of around 800 properties held by the Royal Mail subsidiary Royal Mail Estates which are registered with the Land Registry in England and Wales. The portfolio includes a string of sorting offices and plots of land \u2013 such as the Mount Pleasant and Nine Elms sites in central London which are part of three property redevelopment plans already predicted to make Royal Mail around \u00a3300m. Around 95% of the portfolio is freehold property. As a large proportion of the portfolio consists of sorting offices, investors are unlikely to be able to dispose of them for a quick profit as the business needs the sites to operate. However, analysts have estimated that there could be around \u00a3100m of Royal Mail properties that are surplus to requirements, while the fact that the group owns so many freeholds was always likely to attract certain sections of the property industry, at a time when businesses selling their properties for cash and then leasing them back appears to be coming back into fashion. A spokesman for Royal Mail said the company had &quot;pursued&quot; sale and leaseback in the past, but it was not currently &quot;a key part of our strategy&quot;. However, the UK supermarket group Morrisons announced in September that it would review its \u00a39bn property portfolio with a view to doing such a deal. The Morrisons announcement came only five years after Sir Ken Morrison, the chairman who led the company for 50 years, said that sale and leaseback was anathema to the grocer. Aside from the 800 properties registered to Royal Mail Estates, there are further sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland, while the remainder that take the total to 2,000 are largely made up of leasehold sites that Royal Mail has occupied for less than 10 years. Royal Mail floated last month at an initial value of \u00a33.3bn, but the shares quickly soared prompting criticisms that the taxpayer may have been shortchanged. When the stock exchange closed on Tuesday evening, the company was worth \u00a35.3bn.

The news emerged after the Commons business committee investigating the Royal Mail flotation questioned the business secretary, Vince Cable, and his ministerial colleague Michael Fallon how the offer was valued, prompting an assertion from Cable that there was no need for an independent inquiry into the process. Committee chairman Adrian Bailey said he will be writing to the The Children&apos;s Investment Fund (TCI) and GIC, Singapore&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, which have built up their Royal Mail stakes since its listing to more than 6% and 4%, respectively \u2013 having decided the shares would rise far above their 330p flotation price. He said: &quot;Yes, we might well want to [write to major new shareholders to ask why they value Royal Mail so highly]. We are reviewing the transcript [of evidence] to identify areas to follow up.&quot; The committee has been investigating whether the taxpayer has been shortchanged by the Royal Mail flotation, in which 60% of the shares were sold to outside investors last month. The share price has since soared by about 70%, prompting criticisms that the government could have demanded a higher price. The Bow Group, a thinktank led by former prime minister Sir John Major, has called for an independent inquiry into the privatisation. When asked if he thought an inquiry was required, Cable replied: &quot;Absolutely not. We think this is a good process for the taxpayer.&quot; He added that the valuation was only one criteria in deciding whether or not the taxpayer had received value for money, as the company could have withered \u2013 and its services put at risk \u2013 without access to private capital to invest in its future. &quot;Bearing in mind the set of objectives which we set at the very beginning ... the value for money is partly dependent on the offer price, it&apos;s partly dependent on the continuing value of the state&apos;s [30%] share, and it&apos;s partly dependent on what happens to the company. If the company isn&apos;t able to invest successfully [in its business], you could be left with a serious casualty. When we take all those things together, I think the conclusion will be, when people have settled down, that this has been a very professional well-managed and successful operation.&quot; Royal Mail floated at 330p a share when the government sold 600m shares last month. Once the shares began trading on the stock exchange, they quickly soared. The shares were up 5% on Wednesday afternoon following the group&apos;s first results statement as a public company, changing hands at around 563p. Also being questioned alongside Cable and Fallon were Mark Russell, the chief executive of Shareholder Executive which holds state stakes in businesses, and William Rucker, the chief executive of the government&apos;s main financial adviser, Lazard. Russell said the government had been taken by surprise by the surge in the share price, telling the committee: &quot;We did not anticipate the share price to move to the extent that it did.&quot; He added, however, it had been anticipated that the shares would rise following privatisation, which was part of the reason why the government had retained a 30% Royal Mail stake. Typically, the City hopes the shares rise by around 10% on the first few days of trading following a flotation. Bailey also asked the witnesses if it was predictable that Royal Mail shares would surge so strongly, with the offer was 20 times oversubscribed by investors. Lazard&apos;s Rucker claimed not: &quot;A lot of the orders [for shares] that go into the books ... there is a heavy element of gaming. The three biggest orders were $1bn each. That would have represented 20% of the company. Those institutions had no expectations of ever receiving anything like that quantity of the stock.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2013/nov/27/royal-mail-flotation-row-more-questions", "sentences": ["They pointed to the arrival of two enthusiasts for the shares \u2013 TCI, a hedge fund, and GIC, the Singapore wealth fund \u2013 in a thin market."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-27T18:58:53Z", "title": "Royal Mail's flotation row: two unexplored questions", "tags": ["Royal Mail", "Business", "Postal service", "UK news", "Vince Cable", "Politics"], "article": "The business select committee, after its third attempt to solve the mystery of Royal Mail&apos;s post-flotation soaraway share price, cannot claim to have uncovered a killer fact. Wednesday&apos;s session ran to the now-familiar script. Ministers, supported by their advisers, insisted that 330p was the correct clearing price for 600m shares. They emphasised the risks to the business, such as a strike and the lack of a pay deal. They said institutional buyers would have evaporated if pricing had been pushed harder. They pointed to the arrival of two enthusiasts for the shares \u2013 TCI, a hedge fund, and GIC, the Singapore wealth fund \u2013 in a thin market. And business secretary Vince Cable stood by his &quot;froth&quot; remarks, arguing that perspective (anything between three months and two years, apparently) is required to judge real value. The official account, it has to be said, carries internal logic. One can see how and why decisions were made at every stage. Yet the share price still stands above 550p, valuing Royal Mail at \u00a32bn more than the price at which the government sold 60%. What happened? Aside from the TCI factor (undoubtedly real), two elements may have been under-explored so far. First, the flotation roadshow was conducted under a gloomy cloud. Unlike most flotations, where advisers tend to shout about their wondrous potential of their clients&apos; business, the build-up to the sale of Royal Mail was all about the risks. Quarrelsome relations with the Communication Workers Union were mentioned time and again. The transforming effect of the new regulatory regime, allowing Royal Mail greater freedom to set the price of stamps, hardly got a look-in. One could argue that the government was obliged to err on the gloomy side because the unwritten rule of privatisations is that no retail investor must be hurt. Even so, the pace at which Royal Mail, for all its day-to-day challenges, is generating cash in the new regulatory world is striking. Wednesday&apos;s half-year numbers showed net debt reduced by \u00a3183m to \u00a3723m between March and September. And that&apos;s before the benefit of refinancing the debt at 3.5%, rather than the 8% being charged by government, kicks in. Some analysts think Royal Mail will show net cash in three years&apos; time. The second is related: was the initial dividend of \u00a3133m, or \u00a3200m (20p-a-share) on an annualised basis, set too conservatively? Again, one can understand why Royal Mail would wish to start cautiously. There is a long road ahead to modernise operations, especially on the parcels side. The rate of decline in the volumes of letters is unpredictable, and could accelerate. Strikes could still happen. Even so, note Barclays&apos; forecast for the rate of dividend increase \u2013 23% a year, compound, for three years. So 28p-a-share next year, followed by 33p, and then 37p. In other words, investors were being offered a 6% yield at the flotation price, with the possibility of a near-doubling of the dividend by March 2016. Those dividend increases are not guaranteed \u2013 obviously. But the chance of success amounts to a strong entry on the &quot;reward&quot; side of the risk/reward ledger. None of which is to deny that 565p, wednesday&apos;s share price, carries a strong whiff of irrational exuberance, to use the phrase Cable borrowed. But, come on, the shares could surely have been sold close to 400p if the government had not so obviously painted itself as a frustrated seller and if Moya Greene, Royal Mail&apos;s chief executive, could have been prodded to be a tad more aggressive with her initial dividend."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/28/labor-greens-stymie-hockeys-efforts-to-change-qantas-ownership-rules", "sentences": ["Qantas has been lobbying hard for government action to help it compete with Virgin Australia, which is now majority-owned by Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand and Etihad and has received a $350m injection of funds from its foreign owners."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-28T01:31:48Z", "title": "Labor and Greens would block change to Qantas domestic ownership rules", "tags": ["Qantas", "Australia news", "Airline industry"], "article": "Labor and the Greens are ruling out changes to the legislative requirement that Qantas must be 51% Australian-owned, closing that option until at least next year, as the government searches for ways to quickly boost the competitiveness of the national carrier. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, has canvassed changes to the Qantas Sales Act, which dictates the national carrier must be at least 51% Australian-owned, as well as an injection of government aid, as possible ways to help Qantas cope with \u201cvery significant\u201d challenges and compete with its cashed-up rival Virgin. Hockey has called for a \u201cnational debate\u201d about whether Australia still needs a national carrier, and what price it was prepared to pay. While Hockey has indicated he would prefer loosening the airline\u2019s ownership restrictions, Tony Abbott said on Thursday he wanted it to remain an \u201cAustralian icon\u201d. \u201cI want Qantas to remain an Australian icon, a successful Australian icon,&quot; the prime minister said. &quot;I want Qantas to be as successful as it can be in domestic and international markets. I know the management of Qantas is concerned that in some respects it is competing with one hand tied behind its back so to speak ... let\u2019s see what the people of Australia think on this issue,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cI am happy to look at a range of measures to ensure that happens but certainly at this point I am not being prescriptive.\u201d The shadow transport spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said there were \u201cnational interest and national security reasons\u201d for Qantas to remain majority Australian-owned, and Labor would not support a change to that requirement, but would discuss other options for assistance to Qantas. \u201cThe whole point here is Australia needs a national airline that is majority Australian-owned and the policy implications of walking away from that are much greater than people outside the industry might think \u2026 ownership is the foundation stone of the global aviation industry,\u201d Albanese said. A spokesman for the Greens said they would also oppose any change to the ownership restrictions. Albanese said Labor would discuss the possibility of the government buying back a small stake in the carrier to \u201csend a signal\u201d to the markets that this was \u201cnot just any other company\u201d. Hockey said the future of Qantas was \u201csomething we need to think about as a nation\u201d. He said: \u201cThere are significant benefits to having a national carrier, but it comes at a cost \u2026 if Australia wants to place regulatory handcuffs on Qantas then we have to accept it comes at a cost. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of putting taxpayers\u2019 money behind Qantas but if that is the community view then we will have to pay the price,\u201d he said. \u201cUnquestionably [Qantas] growth is impeded in part by the restrictions that the parliament has placed on their share registry \u2026 the market has changed but still the restrictions are in place. \u201cIf Australians understandably say no, we think it should remain not only Australian-owned but Australian-controlled and we need to have a national carrier, and I think there are many good reasons for that as well, then we&apos;ve got to accept we may have to pay a price for that and that&apos;s a burden the taxpayers may have to pick up.\u201d The attitude of Labor and the Greens makes it impossible to get legislative change through the Senate before next July, and the attitude of crossbenchers after that remains uncertain. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, also criticised Hockey for first floating the issue at a business lunch \u2013 from which his comments were leaked. Shorten said Hockey should \u201cspare us the thought bubbles\u201d and present a clear option for consideration if he had one. Qantas has been lobbying hard for government action to help it compete with Virgin Australia, which is now majority-owned by Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand and Etihad and has received a $350m injection of funds from its foreign owners. The independent senator Nick Xenophon said he feared watering down the restrictions would leave Qantas vulnerable to a private equity takeover or a foreign takeover.\u00a0&quot;Both scenarios are bad for Australian jobs,\u201d he said. Albanese said having a designated national carrier was crucial for the agreements between countries over landing rights and Qantas also provided important national interest functions, for example evacuating Australians in times of crisis. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has acknowledged a change to the Qantas Sales Act would be difficult. &quot;The issues about the Qantas Sale Act is it&apos;s going to need an act of parliament to repeal it and I think in the current parliament getting it through the lower house and the upper house is an issue for us. We need urgent, immediate action on this.

In leagues from Italy to Turkey and from Finland to Germany scores of arrests have been made as hundreds of matches have fallen under suspicion. The scale of the threat to the soul of the game, not to mention the commercial implications, has slowly dawned on sports governing bodies around the world. Last month the president of La Liga warned that at least eight matches per season were fixed in the top two divisions in Spain. In Turkey two of its most famous clubs \u2013 Fenerbahce and Besiktas \u2013 are serving European bans due to match-fixing. And yet there was still a frisson of shock at the first arrests on these shores, which linked the illegal and unregulated betting markets in Asia to matches being played on bumpy pitches on freezing Saturday afternoons in the upper echelons of the non-league pyramid considered the lifeblood of the English game. How big is the problem?  Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, spoke on Thursday of fears that the six arrests could be the &quot;tip of an iceberg&quot;. But it is not as though the alarm bells have not been clanging. Earlier this year, in a self-aggrandising press conference, Europol announced it was probing 380 suspicious matches, including a Champions League tie at Anfield, as part of a Europe-wide crackdown. Fifa and Uefa have separately warned that match-fixing is the biggest threat facing the game and the former has begun issuing lifetime bans to those involved. The fixer caught on camera by the Telegraph&apos;s investigation reeled off a list of countries in which he said he could influence results: &quot;I do Australia, Scotland, Ireland, Europe, World Cup, World Cup qualifier.&quot; Closer to home UK bookmakers earlier this year stopped taking bets on a number of non-league teams amid fears about suspicious betting patterns. And the FA, which like other governing bodies uses a monitoring service to track betting activity in the legal market, issued a warning in March to clubs saying it had become &quot;aware of suspicious betting activity on a number of matches played in the Football Conference South&quot;. How do the fixers operate?  Other recent cases in England, such as that involving Accrington Stanley players in 2009, have been clumsy attempts to place bets on matches in which they were taking part. The arrests made this week are significant because they are the first in which police have gathered enough evidence to link players in England to the huge illegal and unregulated Asian betting markets. Interpol has estimated the size of those illicit markets at $500bn. Once the fixer has gained the trust of a player or group of players, or even a referee, he will direct them to ensure a specific outcome \u2013 such as making sure a minimum number of goals are scored in a particular match. The fixer&apos;s main contact on the pitch will deliver a pre-arranged signal, such as getting booked in the opening five minutes, to show the fix is on. Why do bookmakers accept these bets? If the fixer is feeding back information to associates in the Far East, it may be that the sheer liquidity of the market will hide any suspicion over bets being placed. Monitoring firms have claimed that millions of pounds can be wagered on nondescript non-league football matches, or indeed county cricket games. Inside information is more likely to be used by illegal bookmakers rather than against legal ones, giving them the opportunity to make a killing by offering attractive prices on outcomes they know will not happen. If there was a spike in unusual bets placed with a legitimate bookmaker in this country, he would be obliged to report it to the Gambling Commission under the terms of their licence and it should theoretically be picked up by the monitoring services employed by sports governing bodies. Why are players tempted? Hundreds of documented cases across the world have shown that players earning a relatively low wage can be tempted by what is painted as a low-risk opportunity to earn a huge bonus. As the unnamed Singaporean in the Telegraph undercover investigation, who claims to work for the now notorious fixer Wilson Raj Perumal, says: &quot;The players usually earn around \u00a35,000 a month. So for 90 minutes I pay them \u00a37,000. For two hours, definitely they take.&quot; In recent years that has been true for players, referees and football federations around the world. Although Fifa has now promised to invest \u20ac20m (\u00a316.6m) in Interpol to crack down on the problem, given that its own record is not unblemished when it comes to allegations of corruption and bribery, world football&apos;s governing body is often perceived as conflicted. Who is Wilson Raj Perumal? Why is Singapore the centre of global football match-fixing? In the unravelling web of global fixing, still only partially understood, many roads lead to Singapore. The names of Perumal, a Singaporean of Tamil origin who fixed games on an industrial scale across the world for over a decade and ended up living in Wembley before he was jailed in Finland, and Dan Tan loom large. Some say they are kingpins, others that they are no more than mid-ranking criminals in a much wider network. Singaporean authorities, following criticism over their inaction, finally arrested Tan and 13 others in September. Italian investigators claimed Tan had been involved in fixing 680 local, league and international matches in countless countries between 2008 and 2011. Perumal has been blowing the whistle on some of his former associates as international investigators attempt to piece together the way in which a sophisticated, if sometimes sloppy, network operated to drive profits for illegal bookmaking syndicates in south-east Asia. But those battling international organised crime say the threat is not confined to that area and exists wherever sophisticated criminal gangs are looking for a means to make or launder money. Are the top two divisions in England immune?  Some will look at the fact those players arrested this week are non-league footballers and shrug. They may wonder whether players in the upper echelons of the game earning anything up to \u00a3300,000 a week could ever be tempted. But look at other cases around the world. Look, too, at the fact the Sporting Chance clinic has warned that problem gambling is the unseen epidemic facing the game and at the financial difficulties faced by a significant minority of current and former players. Then consider the lengths that some of those players might be tempted to go to if desperate for money, and the company that they may keep. English football prides itself on its sense of fair play and air of incorruptibility. This week&apos;s arrests will have shaken those comfortable assumptions. The key figures Chann Sankaran Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan  Both men were on Thursday night charged with conspiracy to defraud. Sankaran, 33, a Singapore national, and Ganeshan, 43, who has dual UK and Singapore nationality, are alleged to be members of an illegal betting syndicate that has infiltrated English football, and conspiring to defraud bookmakers by influencing the course of matches Dan Tan Allegedly the ringleader of a global match-fixing network, Tan was arrested in Singapore in September along with 13 others. His network was allegedly responsible for rigging hundreds of matches worldwide, although he may not face trial.

The latest developments will be taken as proof that English football can no longer ignore the match-fixing claims that have swept Europe and the world in recent years, as the government came under fire for not doing more to fund the fight against corruption in sport. In fresh revelations the Daily Telegraph reported that during a secretly recorded meeting with a fixer, he said that he had influenced World Cup qualifiers and matches in other countries. &quot;I do Australia, Scotland, Ireland, Europe, World Cup, World Cup qualifier,&quot; he said, and claimed to control the entire team for one African country. He also claimed to be able to influence referees. The newly constituted National Crime Agency confirmed that Chann Sankaran, a 33-year-old Singapore national, and Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, a 43-year-old with dual UK and Singapore nationality, had been charged. The pair, charged with conspiring together and with others &quot;to defraud bookmakers by influencing the course of football matches and placing bets thereon&quot;, have been remanded in custody and will appear before Cannock magistrates . They were among six people arrested earlier this week following a Telegraph investigation that appeared to show a fixer explaining how he could influence the outcome of matches by paying players \u00a350,000 to guarantee a minimum number of goals. A seventh man was arrested on Thursday, the NCA said, and he and four others were bailed pending further inquiries. They are understood to include Delroy Facey, a former journeyman striker turned agent who once played for Bolton in the top flight but now lives in Huddersfield and turns out for Albion Sports in the NCEL Premier League. The charges represent the first time British authorities have amassed enough evidence to make arrests in a case linking attempts to fix matches in England with gangs benefiting from the huge $500bn illicit gambling market in Asia. The matches concerned are believed to be non-league games, and there have been growing fears for some time that fixers are targeting the Football Conference and the tiers immediately below. Soren Kragh Pedersen, from the European Union policy agency Europol, said the news was not unexpected: &quot;We see it everywhere so it would be a surprise if you did not find it in England also.&quot; Tim Lamb, the chair of the Sports Betting Group, said that it was time for the government to consider funding a specialist integrity unit to fight corruption. &quot;Why do we spend \u00a36m on anti-doping when, in the eyes of some sporting grandees, this is a bigger threat? If governing bodies had more money available to help them with their anti-corruption programmes, the football authorities might have picked this up before the press or the police,&quot; he said. &quot;Player education has been a hugely important factor. In this case, there has clearly been no education or insufficient education to remind them of the need to resist temptation.&quot; Some would like to see part of the tax revenue raised from an amendment to the Gambling Act currently passing through parliament, which forces offshore bookmakers operating in the UK to be licensed here, ringfenced for a new unit. &quot;Unless we do something to ensure sport is fair and free from corruption, we will live to regret it. That&apos;s why the stakes are so high,&quot; said Lamb. Asked why football could not do more itself to fund player education or a new unit Lamb, who is also chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said: &quot;A lot of these problems are not football&apos;s fault. It has no say in what bets are placed. It&apos;s easy to say there&apos;s a lot of money sloshing around in football, but there isn&apos;t a lot of money sloshing around in the lower leagues.&quot; Following a previous review in 2010, chaired by the former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry, a new unit was set up within the Gambling Commission to co-ordinate between sports governing bodies and the police. But many within sport believe it remains underfunded. The shadow sports minister Clive Efford backed the idea of bookmakers contributing more to fight corruption and called for new laws that would make it easier to convict those involved in match-fixing. &quot;Sport governing bodies invest a great deal of time and money into protecting the integrity of their sports. It is not right that betting operators contribute nothing to the sports from which they make a great deal of money,&quot; he said. But the culture secretary Maria Miller said the government was committed to tackling the problem: &quot;Match-fixing undermines the integrity of sport across the world and we will do all we can to help stamp it out. In Britain we have one of the leading systems internationally to tackle this blight but we are not complacent.&quot; The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reacted to the allegations by stating: &quot;What is needed is greater cross-border co-operation and sharing of information, as well as a firm commitment to bring national laws in line with the UN Convention against Corruption which promotes global integrity and transparency. If not, there is a risk that we will no longer believe what we are seeing on the sporting field.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/29/revealed-bonfire-papers-empire", "sentences": ["A British colonial official in Malaya reported that in August 1957, for example, &quot;five lorry loads of papers \u2026 were driven down to the naval base at Singapore, and destroyed in the Navy&apos;s splendid incinerator there."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T07:00:00Z", "title": "Revealed: the bonfire of papers at the end of Empire", "tags": ["National Archives", "UK news", "Politics past", "Politics"], "article": "The full extent of the destruction of Britain&apos;s colonial government records during the retreat from empire was disclosed on Thursday with the declassification of a small part of the Foreign Office&apos;s vast secret archive. Fifty-year-old documents that have finally been transferred to the National Archive show that bonfires were built behind diplomatic missions across the globe as the purge \u2013 codenamed Operation Legacy \u2013 accompanied the handover of each colony. The declassified documents include copies of an instruction issued in 1961 by Iain Macleod, colonial secretary, that post-independence governments should not be handed any material that &quot;might embarrass Her Majesty&apos;s [the] government&quot;, that could &quot;embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers&quot;, that might betray intelligence sources, or that might &quot;be used unethically by ministers in the successor government&quot;. In Northern Rhodesia, colonial officials were issued with further orders to destroy &quot;all papers which are likely to be interpreted, either reasonably or by malice, as indicating racial prejudice or religious bias on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s government&quot;. Detailed instructions were issued over methods of destruction, in order to erase all evidence of the purge. When documents were burned, &quot;the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up&quot;, while any that were being dumped at sea must be &quot;packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast&quot;. Also among the documents declassified on Friday are &quot;destruction certificates&quot; sent to London by colonial officials as proof that they were performing their duties, and letters and memoranda that showed that some were struggling to complete their huge task before the colonies gained their independence. Officials in more than one colony warned London that they feared they would be &quot;celebrating Independence Day with smoke&quot;. An elaborate and at times confusing classification system was introduced, in addition to the secret/top secret classifications, to protect papers that were to be destroyed or shipped to the UK. Officials were often granted or refused security clearance on the grounds of ethnicity. Documents marked &quot;Guard&quot;, for example, could be disclosed to non-British officials as long as if they were from the &quot;Old Commonwealth&quot; \u2013 Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or Canada. Those classified as &quot;Watch&quot;, and stamped with a red letter W, were to be removed from the country or destroyed. Steps were taken to ensure post-colonial governments would not learn that such files had ever existed, with one instruction stating: &quot;The legacy files must leave no reference to watch material. Indeed, the very existence of the watch series, though it may be guessed at, should never be revealed.&quot; Officials were warned to keep their W stamps locked away. The marking &quot;DG&quot; was said to be an abbreviation of deputy governor, but in fact was a protective code word to indicate that papers so marked were for sight by &quot;British officers of European descent only&quot;. As colonies passed into a transitional phase before full independence, with British civil servants working for local government ministers, an entire parallel series of documents marked Personal were created. &quot;Personal&quot; files could be seen only by British governors and their British aides, a system that appears to have been employed in every territory from which the British withdrew after 1961. &quot;The existence of the &apos;Personal&apos; series of correspondence must of course be scrupulously protected and no documents in this series should be transferred to ministers,&quot; colonial officials were warned. While thousands of files were returned to London during the process of decolonisation, it is now clear that countless numbers of documents were destroyed. &quot;Emphasis is placed upon destruction,&quot; colonial officials in Kenya were told. Officials in Aden were told to start burning in 1966, a full 12 months before the eventual British withdrawal. &quot;It may seem a bit early to start talking about the disposal of documents prior to independence, but the sifting of documents is a considerable task and you may like to start thinking about it now.&quot; As in many colonies, a three-man committee \u2013 comprising two senior administrators and one police special branch officer \u2013 decided what would be destroyed and what would be removed to London. The paucity of Aden documentation so far declassified may suggest that the committee decided that most files should be destroyed. In Belize, colonial administrators officials told London in October 1962 that a visiting MI5 officer had decided that all sensitive files should be destroyed by fire: &quot;In this he was assisted by the Royal Navy and several gallons of petrol.&quot; In British Guiana, a shortage of &quot;British officers of European descent&quot; resulted in the &quot;hot and heavy&quot; task falling to two secretaries, using a fire in an oil drum in the grounds of Government House. Eventually the army agreed to lend a hand. The declassified papers show colonial officials asking for further advice about what should and should not be destroyed. In 1963, for example, an official in Malta asked London for advice about which files should be &quot;spirited away out of the country&quot;, and warned that while some documents could be handed over to the new government: &quot;There may again be others which could be given to them if they were doctored first; and there may be files which cannot be given to them under any circumstances.&quot; In June 1966, Max Webber, the high commissioner in Brunei, asked Bernard Cheeseman, chief librarian at the Commonwealth Relations Office, for advice about 60 boxes of files. &quot;My Dear Cheese,&quot; he wrote, &quot;can I, off my own bat, destroy some of these papers, or should the whole lot be sent home for weeding or retention in your records?&quot; Not all sensitive documents were destroyed. Large amounts were transferred to London, and held in Foreign Office archives. Colonial officials were told that crates of documents sent back to the UK by sea could be entrusted only to the &quot;care of a British ship&apos;s master on a British ship&quot;. For example, Robert Turner, the chief secretary of the British protectorate of North Borneo, wrote to the Colonial Office library in August 1963, a few weeks before independence, saying his subordinate&apos;s monthly reports \u2013 &quot;which would be unsuitable for the eyes of local ministers&quot; \u2013 would be saved and sent to London, rather than destroyed. &quot;I ... have been prevailed upon to do so on the grounds that some at least of their contents may come in handy when some future Gibbon is doing research work for his &apos;Decline and Fall of the British Empire&apos;.&quot; Those papers that were returned to London were not open to historians, however. The declassified documents made available Friday at the National Archives at Kew, south-west London, are from a cache of 8,800 of colonial-era files that the Foreign Office held for decades, in breach of the 30-years rule of the Public Records Acts and in effect beyond the reach of the Freedom of Information Act. They were stored behind barbed-wire fences at Hanslope Park, Buckinghamshire, a government communications research centre north of London, a facility that it operates along with MI6 and MI5. The Foreign Office was forced eventually to admit to the existence of the hidden files during high court proceedings brought by a group of elderly Kenyans who were suing the government over the mistreatment they suffered while imprisoned during the 1950s Mau Mau insurgency. Even then, however, the Foreign Office failed to acknowledge that the 8,800 colonial files were just a small part of a secret archive of 1.2m files that it called the Special Collections, and which it had held unlawfully at Hanslope Park. The Foreign Office is understood to have presented a plan to the National Archive earlier this month for the belated transfer of the Special Collections into the public domain. On Thursday it declined to disclose details of that plan. The newly declassified documents show that the practice of destroying papers rather than allowing them to fall into the hands of post-independence governments pre-dated Macleod&apos;s 1961 instructions. A British colonial official in Malaya reported that in August 1957, for example, &quot;five lorry loads of papers \u2026 were driven down to the naval base at Singapore, and destroyed in the Navy&apos;s splendid incinerator there. The Army supplied the lorries (civilian type) and laid on Field Security Personnel to move the files. Considerable pains were nevertheless taken to carry out the operations discreetly, partly to avoid exacerbating relationships between the British government and those Malayans who might not have been so understanding ... and partly to avoid comment by the press (who I understand greatly enjoyed themselves with the pall of smoke which hung over Delhi during the mass destruction of documents in 1947).&quot; A few years later, colonial officials in Kenya were urged not to follow the Malayan example: &quot;It is better for too much, rather than too little, to be sent home \u2013 the wholesale destruction, as in Malaya, should not be repeated.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 29 November 2013 to replace part of a sentence that had been accidentally deleted during the editing process."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/29/farmers-view-tough-decision-gives-us-a-chance-to-grow-into-open-market", "sentences": ["\u201cThis was the first big test for Mr Hockey and his claim that Australia is open for business \u2013 and he has failed.\u201d But consider the two big foreign takeover knockbacks by Australian governments in recent years: Peter Costello\u2019s decision to block Shell\u2019s takeover of Woodside and Wayne Swan\u2019s decision on the Singapore Exchange\u2019s takeover of the ASX.", "In the ASX case, because the Singapore Exchange was a competing capital market which could have prioritised Singapore\u2019s capital mobilisation ahead of Australia\u2019s interests."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T07:23:47Z", "title": "Farmer's view: tough decision gives us a chance to grow into open market", "tags": ["Australia news", "Business"], "article": "The pinstripes are on the warpath.

GrainCorp shares have lost 21% in value, business and political commentators are outraged and the nearest agrarian socialist will be burned at the stake. Bankers everywhere are crying, \u201cWe\u2019ll all be rooned!\u201d It is sad for the traders \u2013 worn down by years of long lunches \u2013 but for those of us growers who use the GrainCorp network, it provides some sort of relief.\u00a0Why? Because it is a step towards building a truly open market. What we have right now is not a free market. As we in the eastern states harvest, no matter who we sell that grain to, we deliver through the GrainCorp network. \u201cThis is not mad ideology,\u201d said the Liberal backbencher Angus Taylor. \u201cThis is solid competition policy and we should never be scared of sticking with those principles.\u201d In his reasons for blocking the sale, the treasurer outlined the reach of GrainCorp\u2019s ownership: 85% of eastern Australia\u2019s bulk grain exports are handled through this company\u2019s infrastructure. GrainCorp represents a network with a higher market share than Coles and Woolworths combined, that includes 280 up-country receival sites, most of which were formerly government/grower-owned infrastructure.\u00a0Hockey acknowledged this monopoly in his decision. \u201cGiven that, the transition towards more robust competition continues and a more competitive network is still emerging, I consider that now is not the right time for a 100% foreign acquisition of this key Australian business.\u201d Labor\u2019s Chris Bowen has jumped on the decision as weak and pathetic. \u201cThis was the first big test for Mr Hockey and his claim that Australia is open for business \u2013 and he has failed.\u201d But consider the two big foreign takeover knockbacks by Australian governments in recent years: Peter Costello\u2019s decision to block Shell\u2019s takeover of Woodside and Wayne Swan\u2019s decision on the Singapore Exchange\u2019s takeover of the ASX. Early reaction from commentators has suggested there were stronger \u201cnational interest\u201d grounds for blocking those bids. In Shell\u2019s case, because its own projects could have received priority over Australia\u2019s north-west shelf liquified gas project. In the ASX case, because the Singapore Exchange was a competing capital market which could have prioritised Singapore\u2019s capital mobilisation ahead of Australia\u2019s interests. Yet, if swallowed whole, GrainCorp would have made up 4% of ADM. The other 96% of ADM deals in global food processing, grain transport and trading, primarily for our biggest wheat competitor, the US. Add to that, allegations against ADM of a dodgy corporate record on price fixing and it seems there was some case to answer on the national interest.  The other suggestion following the decision was that this was the \u201ceasy political decision\u201d, to appease those old dinosaurs, the National party, whose members were threatening the Liberals with a thousand kinds of hurt if they acceded to the ADM takeover. The reality was this was a difficult decision, whichever way it fell. And it does not stop with this decision. Negotiations in the next year will determine access agreements for third parties out of GrainCorp ports, which will now be watched closely following the raised awareness of the issues. In the meantime, ADM\u2019s restrained statement reacting to the knockback would suggest it will consider its options. Also considering his options will be the outspoken Liberal senator Bill Heffernan who has been a vociferous opponent of the takeover as well as the head of the Senate inquiry into grain handling. He was due to haul more witnesses into parliament next week \u2013 possibly an indication why Hockey\u2019s decision came unexpectedly early. Heffernan will now consider widening his inquiry back to its original scope of the whole grain trading industry. The ADM bid has lifted the lid on the can of worms that is GrainCorp. It doesn\u2019t end with Hockey\u2019s decision but for growers it is a good start."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2013/nov/29/christmas-markets-festive-cliche", "sentences": ["They&apos;ve gone as global as Starbucks; there&apos;s a Christkindlmarkt on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, in Chicago&apos;s central business district, Vancouver&apos;s Queen Elizabeth Theatre Plaza and Singapore&apos;s Orchard Road."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T13:42:00Z", "title": "Down with identikit Christmas markets: the novelty that became a festive cliche", "tags": ["Christmas", "Life and style", "Retail industry", "United Kingdom holidays", "Travel", "Business"], "article": "It&apos;s been 15 years since the first German-style Christmas market set its gl\u00fchwein pot on the boil in Birmingham&apos;s New Street, and today the Christkindlmarkt is as much of a Christmas cliche as a pile of rejected orange cremes in an otherwise empty tin of Quality Street.

Jersey&apos;s La F\u00eate d\u00e9 Nou\u00e9 in St Helier has steadfastly resisted a German invasion, and this pretty market has a French/Victorian feel. The most delightfully eccentric of the bunch might be Caerphilly Medieval Market in Wales, which is as Game of Thrones as you&apos;d hope. But if it&apos;s good old-fashioned British prettiness you&apos;re after, Bath&apos;s Christmas market in the shadow of the Abbey specialises in locally made food and handmade gifts.

There are 160\u00a0textiles and garments on display, from tapestries and bedcovers to vestments, shawls and chintz dresses \u2013 most rarely exhibited, many never seen before \u2013 occupying nine big galleries. It is a blockbuster of a show proclaiming the role and significance of\u00a0cotton, silk, wool and linen, dyeing, printing, weaving and embroidering in the history of our world. How we should tell that global history, however, is a matter of fraught debate. There is a grandiloquent suite of tapestries in the show, commissioned by Louis XVI, showing the four continents. An allegorical Africa offers its resources \u2013 ivory and ostrich feathers \u2013 in exchange for commodities. Silks, pearls, porcelains, and chests of spices and tea swamp Asia&apos;s throne. America is a demure young woman needing French guidance. But Europe presides over shipping barrels and a sail, commercially supreme. The tapestries are a\u00a0monument to complacent colonialism and the European grasp on the world&apos;s resources. The west takes the rest.     Palampore (1750\u20111800). Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York    And indeed this was how the story\u00a0used to be told: a heroic tale of discovery and conquest. Or as Adam Smith put it in The Wealth of Nations (1776): &quot;The discovery of America, and that of a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, are the two greatest and most important events in\u00a0the history of mankind.&quot; It is inarguable that the golden age of European maritime navigation was transformative for the economies, aesthetics and worldview of the west, with far-reaching, mixed and often devastating consequences for the communities the mariners reached. To\u00a0maritime trading nations the seas were not a barrier but a highway. Where we see emptiness, the Venetians and Genoese, Portuguese, Spanish, and later the Dutch and English saw sea-lanes and the road to El Dorado. As far as Europeans were concerned, the oldest global commodities were not textiles but spices: pepper, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cardamom, mace and cinnamon. Think Christmas cake. They\u00a0were the mainstay of most world cuisines, but beyond flavouring, their uses were manifold. They were a vital preservative before canning or refrigeration, and key ingredients in perfumes, ritual preparations, love potions and painkillers. Spices were literally worth their weight in gold, but the most precious came predominantly from the so-called Spice Islands, now part of the Indonesian archipelago. Spices were transported by ship across the Indian Ocean, relying on the monsoon winds, by Turkish, Arab, Persian, Indian and Malay merchants, many Muslim. The spread of Islam across the Near East facilitated international trade for Muslim merchants as\u00a0laws and commercial customs were shared. Arabic was the lingua franca of eastern trade for centuries.     Blue-Resist Panel (mid\u201118th century). Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York    The cargo tended to be handed on to\u00a0Christian dealers in Cairo and Constantinople, and from thence to Venice and Genoa, and north. The Europeans had no choice but to pay a\u00a0hefty mark-up price for Asian goods carried on Arab ships or by camel trade. It was direct access to spices that the first expeditions sought. The dates of &quot;discovery&quot; are etched in the history of derring-do. As every schoolboy used to know, in 1492 the\u00a0Genoese Christopher Columbus reached the West Indies in the pay of the Spanish. In 1498, Portuguese sea captain Vasco da Gama led a fleet of four ships around the treacherous Cape\u00a0of Good Hope, and completed the\u00a0journey to India. Three years later, Da Gama went with 20 warships to bombard and seize Calcutta. In 1500, the Portuguese claimed Brazil, and in 1521 Ferdinand Magellan reached the spiceries at last. In the same year, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s landed in Mexico, or &quot;New Spain&quot;, laying waste to the Aztec\u00a0with guns and germs within three years. The discovery of vast reserves of\u00a0silver in northern Mexico in\u00a01545 funded the Spanish crown for centuries, and led to a truly global exchange, because silver for coinage was one of the few things the Chinese desired from the west. From the 1560s, huge silver ships sailed every year from\u00a0Acapulco in Mexico to Manila \u2013 the Spanish colony in the Philippines \u2013\u00a0returning laden with oriental delights. There was more Chinese porcelain in New Spain than in Spain itself. Yet to see the Europeans girdling the\u00a0world with trade as the defining moment in world history is to\u00a0reproduce the myopia of\u00a0the conquistadors, denying the complexity of pre-existing medieval interactions and assuming the globe has one centre (north-west Europe) with all else periphery: as if India, China, Persia and\u00a0the Ottomans had no\u00a0civilisation, international trade or imperial reach of\u00a0their own. By the 14th century, the Chinese diaspora had\u00a0spread across the\u00a0South China Sea as far as Singapore and Java, at least the distance between Seville and New\u00a0Spain. Between 1403\u00a0and 1433, Admiral Zheng He led\u00a0expeditions from\u00a0southern China to\u00a0India, the Horn\u00a0of Africa and the Arabian Gulf. Whether the Chinese reached Australasia centuries before James Cook is still open to speculation. Arabic merchants were in south-eastern waters from the sixth century. The dhow and the junk dominated the Asian trade for centuries.     Cope with Hood (c1730). Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York    A luxuriant hybridity is built into the\u00a0DNA of Interwoven Globe. Textiles were not the primary lure of maritime commerce, but they were valuable cargo to be traded for spices and silver; over\u00a0time they grew in volume and significance, especially for the British merchant marine. Lustrous Chinese silks and brilliant Indian cottons were much in demand in Europe. Defoe likened the insidious spread of exotic textiles to a\u00a0plague in 1708: &quot;\u2026 it crept\u00a0into our houses, closets and bed chambers; curtains, cushions and chairs, and at last beds themselves were nothing but\u00a0Callicoes&quot;. Yet alongside a\u00a0beautiful, but familiar riot of chintz, the exhibition spotlights altogether different conjunctions: Inca tapestries woven for the new colonial elite in Peru, Netherlandish wool transformed into Samurai battle jackets, printed cottons dyed in Gujarat for the Japanese and Indonesian market, and\u00a0silk chasubles crafted in China to be worn by Roman Catholic priests, most of them Spanish. This intermingling of\u00a0cultures was not\u00a0a cosy and cost\u2011free\u00a0bazaar. The Portuguese held their forts only by employing merciless force. When the Dutch ousted them in the 17th century they were just as ruthless. European wars fought on the colonial frontier escalated into a savagery unimaginable at home. An 18th-century Indian hanging represents a\u00a0pitched battle fought between the English and the French East India Companies, abetted by their native allies \u2013 Hindu and Muslim \u2013 over the trading post of Pondicherry. A sample book from the London firm of Benjamin and John Bower advertises 500 basic cottons, targeted at the working poor and slaves (or more accurately their owners). The traffic of slaves \u2013 European, Asian and African, east and west \u2013 was a\u00a0normal feature of\u00a0medieval trade, but the American plantation system, used for growing tobacco, cotton and\u00a0sugar, ate\u00a0up humans on an industrial scale. Religion plays a significant role in this economic history of cloth. The popes ruled between the competing territorial claims of Portugal and Spain in 1494 \u2013 the globe was divided &quot;like an\u00a0orange&quot;, according to a letter written to Charles V. Fashionable Jesuits crop up on Mexican ladies&apos; shawls and a room of glittering clerical vestments in Chinese silk speaks to the material pretensions of the Counter-Reformation and Inquisition.     Jacket (Casaquin) and Petticoat (1725-40). Photograph: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York    The least familiar exhibits reveal the\u00a0material world of the Iberian globe. The social mixing of races, ethnicities and cultures was very evident in Central and South America, producing dazzlingly hybrid traditions in textiles and dress. The extent of direct trade between China and South America is revelatory, with Chinese embroideries embellishing traditional Andean and Mexican garments. Textiles are usually low on the pecking order of objects in museums and galleries. &quot;As far as we know,&quot; says Amelia Peck, Interwoven Globe&apos;s lead curator, &quot;this is the first time that anyone has created an exhibition that uses textiles to tell the story of worldwide trade in the early modern period.&quot; When I asked her whether this is what the audience was expecting, she replied: &quot;People seem to be surprised that what is essentially a historical and economic story can be told so compellingly through such beautiful objects.&quot; The exhibition performs a delicate balancing act: on the one hand mapping European expansion in threads, and, on\u00a0the other, evidencing a wealth of blended influences and interactions that bypass the west, provincialising Europe in the history of the world. Yet\u00a0it is not just a material illustration of postcolonial history, it also makes an\u00a0argument about the global visual impact of the textile trade \u2013 that, according to Peck, &quot;more\u00a0than any other type of object&quot;, commercial fabrics &quot;influenced the visual culture of the locations in which they were marketed as well those in which they were produced. By the 17th\u00a0century, the constant interchange of exotic design motifs, fibres and dyes between these now interconnected markets brought into being, for the first time, a\u00a0common visual language of\u00a0design that was recognisable throughout the\u00a0world&quot;. Whether this was the defining global moment in aesthetics will remain open to debate. A global economy was not created by &quot;the Promethean touch of\u00a0merchants from Europe&quot;. As John Darwin insists in his history of empires, it already existed, flourishing in the maritime commerce pioneered by Asians that linked China, Japan, India, the Persian Gulf and east\u00a0Africa. The powerful resurgence of\u00a0Asia that is now under way only re\u2011establishes these older patterns of\u00a0trade and power. What we now call &quot;globalisation&quot; has never been only\u00a0a European or western phenomenon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/01/xi-jinping-china-leader", "sentences": ["According to Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, Xi is adept at wearing many hats; while he has a flare for Maoist rhetoric, his predilection for combining strong political control with liberal economics makes him more like Deng Xiaoping."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T00:05:42Z", "title": "Xi Jinping: Chinese ruler who's a riddle to the world | Observer profile", "tags": ["Xi Jinping", "China", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "In early November, China&apos;s most powerful man, Xi Jinping, stepped into a rustic farmhouse while on an inspection tour in far-flung Hunan province. The occupants&apos; sole electrical appliance, a fluorescent light bulb, burned overhead. Shi Pazhuan, the family matriarch, was confused. &quot;What should I call you?&quot; she asked \u2013 in\u00a0Chinese, a cordial way of asking who he was. Xi shrugged off the unintended slight. He asked for the woman&apos;s age, heard that she was 64, and grasped her hand. &quot;You are an elder sister to me,&quot; he said. State media immediately reported the encounter \u2013 it seemed perfectly to capture the 60-year-old Chinese president&apos;s down-to-earth leadership style, his warm personality and his affection for the rural poor. Three weeks later, China suddenly and unilaterally declared administrative control over a swath of airspace in the contested East China Sea, sparking an international crisis. Japan, South Korea and the US defied the rising superpower by spontaneously sending aircraft into its newly formed &quot;air defence identification zone&quot;; China scrambled fighter jets in retaliation. Tensions are still simmering. Analysts say that Xi himself, also head of the country&apos;s military, was almost certainly behind the move. When David Cameron arrives in China with the UK&apos;s largest trade delegation tomorrow, he&apos;ll meet a man who&apos;s defined by such contradictions \u2013 a hardline reformer, a cosmopolitan nationalist, a pious egalitarian with zero tolerance for dissent. Since Xi was anointed as the Communist party&apos;s general secretary last November, he has pledged to liberalise markets while maintaining state control; he has trumpeted Chinese benevolence abroad while infuriating regional neighbours; he has promised fairness and transparency while cracking down on civil society groups. State-controlled media call Xi a man of the people; analysts call him calculating and ruthless, China&apos;s most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping. Before Xi took China&apos;s top job, he was perceived as a political chameleon, defined more often by others&apos; projections than observable truths. Optimists called him a possible &quot;closet reformer&quot;; a US State Department cable released by WikiLeaks called him &quot;redder than red&quot;. One year on, the truth probably lies somewhere in between. Despite Xi&apos;s calls for transparency and rule of law, he has launched draconian crackdowns on dissent and freedom of speech. He has tightened controls over the country&apos;s media and internet and ruthlessly suppressed the New Citizens&apos; Movement, a group of activists campaigning for government transparency. He is overseeing massive surveillance and forced relocation programmes in the ethnically divided regions of Xinjiang and Tibet, where tensions show no signs of dissipating. Since last November, Xi has also embodied the Chinese leadership&apos;s effort to improve its image abroad. He has professed a fondness for NBA basketball and Hollywood films; he smiles in public, marking a stark contrast to his robotic predecessor, Hu Jintao. He is no stranger to life abroad; according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks, he has an elder sister living in Canada. His daughter, Xi Mingze, enrolled at Harvard in 2010 under an alias. He first visited the US as a low-level official in 1985 and stayed with a family in Iowa. Western leaders have called him &quot;open&quot; and &quot;affable&quot;. Xi&apos;s wife, People&apos;s Liberation Army singer Peng Liyuan, has been described as a &quot;Chinese Carla Bruni-Sarkozy&quot;; for decades, she was more famous than he was. In March, photographs posted online showing her wearing attire by the Guangzhou-based label Exception triggered a run on the label&apos;s online store, causing its website to crash. Xi&apos;s rise to power was detailed in a video called How to Make a Leader, which was posted to Chinese microblogs in mid-October. Its lack of irony, coupled with its mysterious provenance \u2013 it was made by an unknown production company called On the Road to Revival \u2013 led analysts to assume that officials produced it to court the country&apos;s well-connected youth. Xi &quot;experienced 16 major job transfers&quot;, said the video, which showed an animated Xi bouncing\u00a0on floating platforms, as if in an early video game. He began his career at a &quot;primary-level office&quot; before assuming control of a county, then a city,\u00a0then a series of coastal provinces. This is true meritocracy, the video seemed to shout, &quot;one of the secrets of the China miracle&quot;. Yet analysts say that some of Xi&apos;s success comes from his vaunted lineage. Xi is a &quot;princeling&quot;, a child of the Communist party elite, born on 15 June 1953 to a prominent guerrilla fighter during the party&apos;s famed long march. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was anointed vice-premier in 1959, granting the family a home in Zhongnanhai, a central leadership compound in Beijing. Yet Xi Zhongxun fell foul of Mao Zedong in 1962, and a few years later his family was consigned to manual labour in Liangjiahe village, a ramshackle town in northern Shaanxi province. Xi spent seven years in Liangjiahe under the same conditions as his neighbours \u2013 he lived in a cave home, subsisted on rice gruel, hauled buckets of water from a nearby well. &quot;There was nothing flashy about him,&quot; a friend from Xi&apos;s youth told the LA Times. &quot;It was as though he always had a sense of mission about him.&quot; Xi later earned a spot at prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing, joined the Communist party in January 1974 and spent the following decades blasting through two- to three-year posts. He began his career as an aide to the powerful military leader Geng Biao, his father&apos;s former subordinate \u2013 &quot;a job that deepened his affection for the army&quot;, reported Xinhua, China&apos;s official newswire. Later, he connected with rural farmers as a party secretary in Hebei, a flat, dusty province surrounding Beijing. In 1985, he was transferred to Fujian, where he climbed the ranks for more than a decade before becoming its governor. Then came a transfer to Zhejiang province, a mecca for manufacturers and entrepreneurs; in 2007, he was handed the reins in Shanghai after a corruption scandal. Within a year, he was promoted to the country&apos;s highest decision-making body, the politburo standing committee. Xi&apos;s father was known for his moderation and outspokenness. In 1978, after Mao&apos;s death, Deng Xiaoping appointed him as governor of southern China&apos;s Guangdong province, where he helped implement the nation&apos;s first special economic zone. The elder Xi often ran counter to party orthodoxy: he was a staunch supporter of former party secretary Hu Yaobang, a purged reformer whose death sparked the Tiananmen Square protests; he wore an expensive watch given to him in the 1950s by the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader now reviled by Beijing. Xi seems to have inherited his father&apos;s appetite for reform, if not his liberalism. In November, top leaders gathered in Beijing for the third plenum, a conclave that leaders have historically used as a launching point for dramatic reforms. The results lived up to expectations. According to a plenum report published in state media, by 2020, China will relax its one-child policy, abolish a controversial &quot;re-education through labour&quot; penal system and revise an outmoded residence registration system that denies basic social benefits to rural-urban migrants in their adopted homes. The government has pledged to give the market a &quot;decisive&quot; role in the country&apos;s economy, which it is hoped will make it easier for the poor to claw their way into the middle class. Perhaps Xi&apos;s most high-profile campaign has been his frugality and anti-corruption drive, intended to target top party &quot;tigers&quot; and rank-and-file &quot;flies&quot;. While the campaign has far from ended corruption in China, it has netted 11 ministerial and provincial-level leaders and changed the way that officials operate. Yet critics say that Xi has used the campaign to undercut his rivals, while his message of frugality has simply driven corruption underground. One of Xi&apos;s greatest challenges has been dispatching Bo Xilai, a former rival who fell from grace last year following revelations that his wife had murdered a British businessman. In September, a court in Shandong province sentenced Bo to life in prison for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. Critics say that Xi has been whittling away Bo&apos;s power base ever since. According to Bo Zhiyue, an expert on Chinese politics at the National University of Singapore, Xi is adept at wearing many hats; while he has a flare for Maoist rhetoric, his predilection for combining strong political control with liberal economics makes him more like Deng Xiaoping. &quot;Chinese political leaders usually give us a lot of surprises,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;m still trying to understand who Xi Jinping really is.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/01/michael-gove-labour-international-league-table", "sentences": ["England sits near the Pisa average in terms of performance, but Hunt said the country needed to emulate the successful education systems of China, Singapore and South Korea, which have climbed to the top of the OECD rankings."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T17:32:52Z", "title": "Michael Gove blames Labour for international league table performance", "tags": ["Michael Gove", "Education policy", "Education", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Michael Gove has pointed to &quot;children educated almost entirely under Labour&quot; to explain England&apos;s lacklustre performance in international education league tables to be published later this week. The relative positions of England, Scotland and Wales are expected to be little changed when the OECD releases its latest Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) on Tuesday, setting off another political battle over the direction of England&apos;s state schools. &quot;The results due out this week are a verdict on the last government. These tests were taken in 2012 by children who had been educated almost entirely under Labour and before most of our reforms had even been introduced,&quot; said the education secretary. &quot;The real test of our reforms will be how we do in a decade&apos;s time.&quot; But Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, fired the first shots with a commentary piece in the Sunday Times arguing that Gove&apos;s reforms were not helping. &quot;All his frenetic attention-seeking changes of the past three years \u2013 structural reforms, curriculum rewrites, multiplying assessment criteria \u2013 have not delivered the step change in standards we need,&quot; Hunt said. Reports over the weekend said the UK had &quot;stagnated&quot; in the latest tests, following the fall in the OECD league table it suffered in the 2009 edition of Pisa. England sits near the Pisa average in terms of performance, but Hunt said the country needed to emulate the successful education systems of China, Singapore and South Korea, which have climbed to the top of the OECD rankings. Hunt said the quality of teachers and training in China&apos;s high-tech Shanghai corridor contrasted with the government&apos;s efforts to allow unqualified teachers in English classrooms. &quot;In Shanghai all teachers have a teaching qualification and undergo 240 hours of professional development within the first five years of their career,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;Contrast this with Gove&apos;s attack on the status of teaching in England \u2026 In England the South Leeds academy can advertise for &apos;an unqualified maths teacher&apos; with four GCSEs. How is that going to help us win the global race?&quot; Hunt said, referring to a secondary school in Yorkshire that recently posted that job ad. Whitehall sources pointed out that the 12,000 English 15-year-olds who sat the OECD&apos;s tests at the end of 2012 would have had eight years in school under a Labour government, and just two years under the current Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. &quot;In the past, these tests have shown that, despite constantly rising exam results, our performance stagnated as others raced ahead,&quot; Gove said on Sunday. &quot;Our reforms are rooting out grade inflation, restoring rigour to the curriculum, giving headteachers more freedom, improving the quality of teachers and ensuring young people leave school with the skills they need to compete.&quot; The triennial survey of reading, maths and science attainment by 15-year-olds in 66 countries has been criticised for its complex methods, and for the standardised tests it uses to judge reading and mathematical ability across countries as diverse as Qatar, Macau and Russia. Around the world governments are preparing for good and bad news. New Zealand has seen its rankings slip substantially since the 2009 tests, when it was among the leaders, according to comments by the country&apos;s education minister Hekia Parata last week."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/02/productivity-commission-auto-industry-inquiry-begins", "sentences": ["Macfarlane was disappointed that the managing director of Holden, Mike Devereux, was promoted to a new international job with General Motors, based in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T04:37:03Z", "title": "Car industry inquiry is likely to present Tony Abbott with a stark choice", "tags": ["Australian politics", "Automotive industry", "Australia news"], "article": "The Abbott government&apos;s inquiry into the Australian car industry kicks off today in what might be the last hurrah for a much-loved Australian brand \u2013 Holden. Holden was once immortalised in song for being as dinky di Aussie as kangaroos, football and meat pies, despite being wholly owned by General Motors of the US since 1931. But the fate of the carmaker now rests on the Productivity Commission&apos;s inquiry into the shrinking Australian car industry and the response of the government to that inquiry. The company has not yet reached the end of the road, but the commission has to hand over an interim report by 20 December and a final report by the end of March 2014. Holden&apos;s historic rival, Ford, has already announced it will stop making cars locally by October 2016, leaving only Holden and Toyota Australia. If Holden decides to stop making cars here, Toyota is likely to follow because the crucial component supply chain would lack the critical mass to survive. The Abbott government has indicated that it is open to interim funding but this is missing the point. Both Holden and Toyota need long-term taxpayer assistance and industry policy for the next decade, in order to attract investment from their parent companies needed to build new models. Like everyone else, the car industry could see that the Coalition was poised to win the 2013 election. They tried to engage beforehand with the combative shadow industry minister, Sophie Mirabella, over a policy pledge to cut $500m from the main industry assistance program by 2015 while setting long-term funding after studying the report by the Productivity Commission. They got nowhere with Mirabella, and complained of being lectured, even hectored. Along with others, the car industry quietly rejoiced when Mirabella was defeated by an independent candidate at the election, The new industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, previously held the portfolio during the Howard government and is a rare Australian politician who has worked with his hands, being able to do a spot of welding if required. He likes the industry, visiting a new car plant in Italy out of personal interest a few years back, and even having a Holden cap autographed by the late racing driver Peter Brock. Macfarlane has so far lacked support among federal Coalition MPs on continued industry assistance, although the mood is different in the key automotive states of Victoria and South Australia. Macfarlane was disappointed that the managing director of Holden, Mike Devereux, was promoted to a new international job with General Motors, based in Singapore. Devereux is a good talker and is undoubtedly pushing for Holden to stay, but he is now splitting his attention and the company is not expected to get a new full-time boss until early next year. He was further peeved when the Shanghai-based regional chief of General Motors, Stefen Jacoby, made his first visit to Australia earlier in November and did not meet him, despite the fate of the company being up for grabs. Behind the scenes, key government figures are spinning the line that Holden has already decided to go and that no realistic package would keep. In public, the treasurer, Joe Hockey, has even tried to blame Labor for any eventual closures in the car industry. But this is incorrect, Holden and Toyota were prepared to stay under Labor&apos;s policy settings. If the industry shuts now, it is due to decisions taken, or not taken fast enough, by the Coalition. The automotive sector is deeply worried by the sceptical stance of the two main economic ministers, Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann, and the relative silence so far of the prime minister, Tony Abbott. But the rejection of the bid for Graincorp showed that the Coalition are by no means free-market purists. Abbott and his advisers will be keenly aware of the political and economic fallout from the collapse of an industry which directly employs some 45,000 workers.     Holden's Mike Devereux, industry minister Ian Macfarlane and South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill at Holden's Elizabeth plant in Adelaide on October 2. Photograph: AAP/Tim Dornin    Holden has its corporate headquarters and an engine plant in Melbourne, but its assembly plant in Adelaide is a mainstay of the South Australian economy. South Australia has a state election in mid-March 2014, about a fortnight after the Productivity Commission is scheduled to deliver its final report on the car industry, but the fate of Holden is likely to be clear before polling day. This leaves the state Liberal leader, Steven Marshall, in a tricky position, given that his federal colleagues will see him as only one of many voices. South Australia\u2019s Labour premier, Jay Weatherill, is vigorously arguing for continued support to Holden. If that does not work, Weatherill will blame the Coalition, a political tactic that will not fill the economic void. The other major automotive state, Victoria, has its own election in November 2014. One of the first witnesses to give evidence to the Productivity Commission on Monday will be the South Australian premier, who has argued that the cost of industry assistance is dwarfed by not having to pay out some $21.5 billion in future welfare payments if Holden closed its assembly plant at Elizabeth in Adelaide&apos;s northern suburbs. Indeed, the City of Playford, where the Holden plant is located, already has an unemployment rate of 15.5%. The South Australian government&apos;s submission to the inquiry maps out the Australian automotive supply chain as having: \u2022 A total of 33 so-called \u201cTier-1 companies\u201d directly supply Holden, Toyota and Ford and employing more than 3,700 workers \u2022\u00a0Another 719 companies employing 28,000 to 32,000 people supply the Tier 1 companies \u2022\u00a0Only a quarter of the Tier-1 companies were diversified enough to survive if local car making ended and all 719 indirect suppliers would be vulnerable. The tricky thing about this supply chain is that thousands of jobs are located in supposedly non-automotive states like New South Wales and Queensland. Indeed, a company called Australian Arrow manages a high-volume plant in Samoa which produces electrical wire harnesses that are supplied to Toyota Australia. The Samoa plant has more than 800 workers, making it the nation&apos;s biggest employer outside of the public service. It accounts for about two-thirds of Samoa&apos;s manufacturing sector and of its exports in 2012. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union rallied outside the commission\u2019s hearings on Monday and its state secretary, John Camillo, has argued more is at stake than the 7,700 direct automotive jobs linked to Holden. &quot;The Productivity Commission must understand this the isn\u2019t just about economics, it\u2019s about families and communities right here in South Australia,\u201d Camillo said. The state&apos;s main employer lobby, Business SA, disagrees with unions about some of the solutions but it has warned that the last year was &quot;extremely tough&quot; with the local economy contracting by $145 million. &quot;The immediate impact of losing Holden would be akin to several years of similar economic malaise,&quot; it says. For their part, Holden and Toyota argue that Australia&apos;s support for the automotive industry is moderate in global terms and is far outweighed by the economic activity generated. Holden reckons to have received $1.8 billion in federal funding over between 2001 and 2012 while generating $32.7 billion of economic activity. \u201cIf Holden did not manufacture in Australia, the economic activity derived from the foreign investment by GM would not go elsewhere in Australia,\u201d the company&apos;s submission says. \u201cIn fact, it would be invested by GM in another country.\u201d Both Toyota and Holden play down the benefits of the Abbott government scrapping the carbon tax. Toyota&apos;s submission says that the impact of the tax per locally made vehicle has been widely reported to be $400 per car, but it only $115 and this had been absorbed by the company and not passed on to consumers. Holden says the carbon tax added about $45 to the cost of each locally made car, but this was not passed on. Toyota is due to give evidence to the commission\u2019s inquiry on Tuesday. Holden chief Mike Devereux will give evidence on 10 December."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/02/elbulli-ferran-adria-bullipedia", "sentences": ["Sensors will be used to track both the people and the tools used to prepare a dish, to enable those trying to recreate it in a kitchen in Singapore or London to do so with greater precision."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T09:00:00Z", "title": "Ferran Adri\u00e0, the chef who brought us elBulli, takes his next step \u2013 Bullipedia", "tags": ["Ferran Adri\u00e0", "Chefs", "Food & drink", "Science", "Technology", "Spain", "Life and style", "UK news", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "Professor Adrian Cheok was feeling a bit nervous. In October, he and his small team of postgraduate students learned that their invention was one of four finalists in the HackingBullipedia contest, and although the accomplished professor at City University in London, where he is also director of its Mixed Reality Lab, has received a slew of awards for his work on the interface between humans and computers, this contest promised to be different. For one thing, although there would be plenty of IT and computing experts on the jury, the most important judge was a chef. And not just any chef, but Ferran Adri\u00e0. Cheok had reason to be apprehensive: Adri\u00e0 is widely considered the most influential chef of our time. At his restaurant elBulli, located on the north-eastern coast of Spain, he revolutionised cuisine by bringing a radical, scientifically inflected creativity to bear on the process of cooking. The techniques and ingredients he developed in his kitchen and in his famous lab just off of Barcelona&apos;s Boqueria market \u2013 the foams, the sands, the liquids turned into tremulous globules via the magic of spherification \u2013 produced some startling dishes: &quot;dragon&quot; cocktails that made the drinker breath smoke; &quot;caviar&quot; made from pearls of olive oil; a robust plate of lapin royale made into gelatin. Hot into cold, sweet into savoury, solid into liquid or air, during the 27 years he ran the restaurant, Adri\u00e0 played with his diners&apos; expectations, undermined established categories of taste and texture, and constantly, miraculously, continued to surprise. &quot;Presenting our prototype to him,&quot; explains Cheok, &quot;is like performing a song for Michael Jackson.&quot; Luckily for Cheok, Adri\u00e0 won&apos;t be judging the team for its cooking skills, but for its imagination. Indeed, ever since elBulli shut its doors to the public in 2011, the chef has been busy turning the restaurant into the elBulli Foundation, the primary mission of which is to foster not just good cooking, but greater innovation in the kitchen and out of it. &quot;I&apos;ve been very successful, and very lucky, and now I want to give something back,&quot; he says. &quot;And the best thing I can give is teaching others what I know, which is creativity.&quot;     Frozen parmesan foam.    Creativity was always at the core of what Adri\u00e0 did as a chef. By marrying scientific techniques and processes to his wild imagination, he developed what he called &quot;a new language&quot; of cuisine. He and his cooks learned to use sodium alginate and calcium carbonate to turn liquids into &quot;spherifications&quot;; to employ liquid nitrogen to create a frozen parmesan foam; to add hydrocolloids to thicken sauces without flour or butter. Few of these innovations were actually his inventions. Most of the novel techniques he employed had been used previously in industrial food production but had never before been applied to fine dining. And despite the sometimes mocking depictions of him as a test-tube wielding scientist, Adri\u00e0 refused to distinguish his techniques as essentially distinct from anything chefs had always done. How was a PacoJet any more alien a machine than an oven? Why did we consider maltodextrose a processed &quot;additive&quot; and sugar a &quot;natural&quot; ingredient? Once when, in the course of one interview, a journalist enquired yet again about the gadgetry and chemistry-set cooking he had heard so much about, a mildly exasperated Adri\u00e0 pulled the hapless reporter into the kitchen. &quot;You want to see my technology?&quot; he demanded. He grabbed the hand of one of the line of apprentice chefs busy shelling pistachios, and turned it over to revealing red fingers sore from hours of meticulous labour. &quot;There&apos;s my technology.&quot; In other words, Adri\u00e0 rejected the notion that he was somehow breaking with what normal chefs did, just as he rejected the idea that his style of cooking represented a rupture with the centuries of cuisine that had preceded it. His style of cooking \u2013 often called &quot;molecular gastronomy&quot; although Adri\u00e0 reviled the term \u2013 was an evolution, just as nouvelle cuisine evolved from the traditional cooking of France. Now, as he moves onto the next phase of his career, the ways in which he is bringing technology from other disciplines to bear on cuisine are evolving again. &quot;ElBulli never closed,&quot; Adri\u00e0 says, &quot;We just stopped serving meals.&quot; Indeed, ever since the chef stunned the food world in January 2010 by announcing he would no longer be serving food, he and his team, which involves a partnership with the Madrid-based telecommunications giant Telef\u00f3nica, have been hard at work designing the elBulli Foundation. At first, its shape and purpose were noticeably vague (&quot;The only thing I can tell you for sure,&quot; said Adri\u00e0 at one point, &quot;is that it won&apos;t be a cooking school. We won&apos;t be teaching anyone to break down a cod.&quot;) Three-and-a-half years later, however, several concrete projects are underway. Perhaps the easiest to understand is elBulli 1846. It wouldn&apos;t be an exaggeration to call Adri\u00e0 and his crew hoarders, albeit very, very organised ones. Over the years, they have kept track of just about everything, from the prototypes for spoons designed to serve the restaurant&apos;s famous spherified olives to Adri\u00e0&apos;s tasting notes on a black-and-white sesame dish called ying-yang, with a slew of magazine covers and cartoonist Matt Groening&apos;s depiction of Ferran in full The Simpsons style. All of those items will be on display in a new museum and archive that will be housed in Roses, the town on the Catalan coast nearest to elBulli (the 1846 refers both to the number of recipes created at elBulli in Adri\u00e0&apos;s time there, and to the year in which the famous French chef Auguste Escoffier was born.) Adri\u00e0 says he expects 200,000 visitors a year to the museum. Eight kilometres up a winding coastal road to the village of Cala Montjoi, the former restaurant will become a research centre, named elBulli DNA, and will form the second of the foundation&apos;s key projects. There, the old tchotchke-filled dining room and sleekly modern kitchen will be preserved intact, but will be complemented by new buildings with vaguely organic shapes that recall both Gaud\u00ed and Alice in Wonderland, to be designed by the Catalan architect Enric Ruiz-Geli. The complex will include administrative offices, a screening room and archives, but its beating heart will be the old elBulli kitchen, which will be transformed into a hive of culinary experimentation of the sort that Adri\u00e0 and his team used to conduct at their workshop in Barcelona during the six months that the restaurant was closed each year. But instead of inventing new dishes or techniques for the restaurant&apos;s lucky diners, the cooks will be sharing their findings with the world.     Adri\u00e0 with his team. Photograph: Gunnar Knechtel     Thanks to support both financial and technical from Telef\u00f3nica, the elBulli DNA test kitchen promises to be among the most advanced in the world. But with Adri\u00e0&apos;s new emphasis on spreading ideas instead of just fomenting them, it will also be tailored to promote different kinds of interaction. Each day, the fellows at elBulli DNA will upload the results of their work so the rest of the world may follow. Sensors will be used to track both the people and the tools used to prepare a dish, to enable those trying to recreate it in a kitchen in Singapore or London to do so with greater precision. Screens within the kitchen will make it possible for a cook in the cold station to see what another is doing at the stove. And interfaces that rely on gesture rather than touch will enable cooks whose hands are otherwise occupied to access the online database. Other innovations, says Maria Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e9, innovation manager at Telef\u00f3nica R&amp;D, are sure to come. &quot;Ferran sees things in a different way,&quot; says Tom\u00e9. &quot;We are working with him in part because we want to support innovation, and in part because we see this as a way of generating new opportunities for the company, new products that accelerate the creative process and that we may be able to commercialise.&quot; One of elBulli DNA&apos;s first projects, already underway, is to develop a comprehensive classification \u2013 a taxonomy, of sorts \u2013 of all food products: their biological origins, their relation to other foods, even how they got their names. &quot;You can&apos;t fully create if you don&apos;t understand what you&apos;re working with,&quot; Adri\u00e0 says. &quot;What&apos;s the difference between ravioli and empanadas? They&apos;re both dough stuffed with something. How can I come up with a new take on them if I can&apos;t explain what each one is?&quot; At a gathering with chefs and seed breeders in New York in September, he delighted in approaching the scientists and asking each to explain the difference between a fruit and a vegetable. &quot;You see?&quot; he would cackle as one after another stumbled over the answer. &quot;We don&apos;t know anything. I&apos;m Ferran Adri\u00e0, I&apos;ve been cooking for 30 years, and even I don&apos;t know the answer to something like that.&quot; The taxonomy will be created in-house, and turned into software that culinary schools and other institutions can use. Those characteristics distinguish it from the foundation&apos;s third great initiative, named Bullipedia. The goal of that database, however, is no less daunting. In the modest language of its creators, it will &quot;organise in a clear, ordered and precise way all culinary knowledge&quot;. Luckily, Adri\u00e0 and his team will have some help: the database will be created by the same professionals for whom it is intended. Culinary schools, restaurants, and universities will all contribute. Although the comparisons \u2013including in the name \u2013 to Wikipedia are unavoidable, the Bullipedia will not be based on crowdsourcing per se, but rather on the work of a select, vetted group of contributors. And because it is important to the foundation that all the information in the Bullipedia be absolutely accurate (another difference from Wikipedia), the foundation will provide the documentation and templates that contributors need to craft their entries. What that means in practice remains to be seen. But planners \u2013 including researchers at the University of Barcelona, which will oversee the Bullipedia \u2013 are working with the idea that a user searching within the database for information on, say, broccoli, would come up with entries that included not only recipes for dishes simple and elaborate, but also biological information on brassicas, suggestions for flavour pairings, information on optimum growing and harvesting conditions, techniques for cooking and preserving it, and notes about where the next steps in broccoli innovation may lie.     Vegetable gelatin blocks at elBulli restaurant. Photograph: Getty Images    Does the world \u2013 even the rarified world of chefs \u2013 really need so baroque a compendium of knowledge? But Adri\u00e0&apos;s motivation for compiling and organising goes far beyond the mere knowledge itself. &quot;Order, order, order, that&apos;s how you create,&quot; he says. And indeed, both the genome and the Bullipedia can be seen as continuations, albeit on a much grander, more comprehensive scale, of the archival work that Adri\u00e0 and his team used to do back when they were actually feeding people. From early on, the restaurant meticulously catalogued its work, not just the successful recipes and techniques that made it into the dining room, but the hundreds of failures along the way. That tedious labour may not fit most people&apos;s romanticised vision of inspiration, but it was critical to Adri\u00e0&apos;s creative process. If he got a notion to come up a new dish featuring pine nuts, for example, he could go back through years of notebooks to find everything he had ever done to them \u2013 cooked them in a creamy broth to make a pine nut risotto; infused them in pinecones filled with boiling water for a pine nut tea \u2013 and build from there. The Bullipedia takes that basic idea, that from order comes the anarchy of creativity, and multiplies it a thousand-fold. By taking what was originally a purely written form of documentation \u2013 later, Adri\u00e0&apos;s crew would also take photos of finished dishes \u2013 and making it digital, the information contained in the Bullipedia will be available to anyone with an internet connection. By making the compilation of knowledge interactive, it guarantees that the Bullipedia will remain a living document, able to change and react to any new invention or discovery. To jump-start the collaboration, Adri\u00e0 and his partners from Telef\u00f3nica launched the Hacking Bullipedia contest. The competition drew dozens of entries. Cheok&apos;s submission was one of the four finalists It is for a device that uses electric stimulation of the taste buds, coupled with a chemically produced scent emitted from a device that attaches to a mobile phone, to reproduce the flavours of any food or dish. &quot;This is a new kind of virtual reality that allows users not just to see food on the internet but to taste and smell it,&quot; he says. Cheok imagines that the invention could be useful to a chef who, in looking through the Bullipedia, wanted to know what the spherified olives she read about there tasted like, or who wants to use the knowledge contained within the work to create new flavours altogether. Is all this folly? With anyone else, it would be easy to say yes. But Adri\u00e0 has been called crazy before: when he decided to close six months of the year; when he opened a workshop dedicated solely to experimentation. In each of those cases, and in many others, he triumphed. And throughout, Adri\u00e0 has been consistent in his evolution. In fact, all of the changes described above were undertaken in the quest to keep alive his remarkable ability to innovate.     Adri\u00e0 at work at elBulli in 2008. Photograph: Rex Features    Back in January 2010, when the Catalan chef announced that he was closing elBulli, the idea that so successful a restaurant would voluntarily close was unthinkable to many, and foodie circles speculated that an ugly reason \u2013 health problems, money issues, a brewing lawsuit \u2013 lay beneath the unexpected decision. But in a world in which boundless ambition is taken as an obvious good, the truth was even more scandalous: Adri\u00e0 closed the restaurant in order to keep doing what he had always done best, which was not to make money or be successful or even to cook, but rather to innovate. Three years later, as the elBulli Foundation&apos;s shape coheres, Adri\u00e0 is more enthusiastic about the project than ever. &quot;I&apos;m no longer interested in creating dishes,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m interesting in creating the creators of dishes.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/dec/02/ftse-100-falls-caution-upbeat-manufacturing", "sentences": ["The group was previously a subsidiary of Singapore&apos;s CSE Global, which sold its interest in Servelec to concentrate on its Asia Pacific businesses."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-02T16:52:08Z", "title": "FTSE falls back despite upbeat global manufacturing surveys", "tags": ["Business", "Fresnillo", "Randgold Resources", "Anglo American", "Vedanta Resources", "Tesco", "J Sainsbury", "Morrisons", "Debenhams", "Shire", "Lloyds Banking Group", "Royal Bank of Scotland"], "article": "After recording their first monthly fall since August in November, leading shares began the new month on another downbeat note. Despite a series of relatively upbeat manufacturing surveys from around the globe, in particular China and the UK, investors remained cautious and preferred to take more notice of a disappointing Spanish report. But there was little in the way of volume ahead of a busy week on the economic front, with the latest meetings of the Bank of England and European Central Bank, the autumn statement in the UK and US non-farm payroll figures. So the FTSE 100 finished the day 55.24 points lower at 6595.33. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:  Even though today&apos;s economic data has by and large been on the positive side European markets have slid back as investors have appeared to book profits as we head into the final furlong of 2013.  With markets sitting on double digit percentage gains across the board, it seems quite likely that investors are taking the view that markets have front run the recent improvement in data and in the absence of further significant improvements, as well as a worrying divergence in Spanish and French economic data, that now is as good a time as any to think about book squaring into year end.  There is also the small matter that we have a number of key central bank meetings later this week, as well as the latest US employment reports from both ADP and BLS non-farm payrolls on Friday.   With gold and silver prices under pressure, Mexican precious metals miner Fresnillo fell 73p to 760p and Randgold Resources lost 189p to \u00a341.57. Base metal businesses were also lower, with Anglo American down 56p at \u00a312.93 and Vedanta Resources losing 25.5p to 859.5p. With little in the way of corporate news, broker notes had a strong influence on the market. Supermarkets came under pressure after analysts at HSBC suggested Tesco, down 7.05p to 340.9p, could begin aggressively cutting prices to try and regain market share. With signs of further progress from discounters like Lidl, the rest of the sector also suffered. J Sainsbury dropped 10.6p to 396.8p while Morrisons was down 6p at 259.5p. Still with retail, Debenhams dipped 3.8p to 92.95p as Barclays issued a negative note:  Debenhams&apos; online sales are margin dilutive, their online offering lags competitors, and consensus underestimates the investment necessary both in cost and time before the company catches up with competition in our view. Earnings momentum has stalled while earnings visibility has deteriorated. We reduce our earnings estimates by around 12% and now sit 10% below Reuters&apos; consensus earnings in 2014 and 2015. We reduce our target price to 80p from 97p, which implies 18% downside from the current share price. We downgrade Debenhams from equal weight to underweight.   But pork producer Cranswick climbed 15p to \u00a311.56 as Investec issued a buy recommendation following last week&apos;s half year results. Investec analyst Nicola Mallard said:  It&apos;s a familiar pattern now for followers of Cranswick: pig prices rise, the share price wobbles, but then recovers as the margin pressure recedes. The group has confirmed margins are now improving in the second half, hence the recent small rally. However, we think the stock price has more ground to recover as it effectively missed the mid cap re-rating of recent months. We move our target price up to 1275p on unchanged forecasts and reiterate our buy recommendation.   Shire lost 63p to \u00a327.09 after a negative note from UBS. The bank has moved its recommendation from buy to neutral and cut its price target from \u00a331 to \u00a330.60. It said:  Shire has diversified its pipeline and appears ideally positioned to benefit from strong underlying growth but we believe a few upcoming clinical trial read-outs carry more downside risk than upside risk.   On the way up was Lloyds Banking Group, 1.18p better at 78.58p after positive funding for lending figures and confirmation of its new chairman. Royal Bank of Scotland rose 4.2p to 331.4p. Finally Servelec, a UK technology group which provides software, hardware and services to the healthcare, energy and broadcast sectors, made a good start to life as a public company. The group was previously a subsidiary of Singapore&apos;s CSE Global, which sold its interest in Servelec to concentrate on its Asia Pacific businesses. Its shares climbed from the 179p offer price to close at 215p. Chief executive Alan Stubbs said:  Being a public company provides Servelec with a platform to capitalise on the numerous growth opportunities available for both Servelec Healthcare and Servelec Automation, which will help to generate value for all of our stakeholders.   Analysts at Killik &amp; Co said:  We view Servelec as an attractively valued mix of high-margin, secular growth businesses that each have significant elements of recurring revenue. The group is cash generative and has a low capital intensity, which combined with the fact that the company is in a net cash position at float, in our view, leaves scope for returns of capital to shareholders in the future \u2013 over and above the indicated 2% prospective yield.

In it, there was a general sense of chaos, underlined by the headteacher telling me that his goal for the school was simply &quot;to keep the children off the street&quot;. Fast-forward 10 years and the same school is one of many across London that is now succeeding at an extraordinarily high level, thanks to great leadership and outstanding teaching. This success was driven home to me by a child from a low-income family in this school who was planning to study maths at the University of Manchester. His older brother had attended the same school seven years earlier, had dropped out at 16, been unemployed and was now in prison for a petty crime. It was a shame, he confided in me, as his older brother was actually the smart one in the family but had just never seen the point of school. That one family&apos;s story of personal tragedy and triumph is writ large by today&apos;s Pisa results, which highlights the power of great teaching and school leadership in dozens of countries around the world. Unlike in previous generations, there are few good employment opportunities left for poorly educated young people. The countries that understand this shift and manage to run education systems preparing all of their young people for this future \u2013 such as China, Singapore, South Korea, Finland, Netherlands and Canada - will win the global economic race. More importantly, they will have fewer human casualties left behind. I was in Shanghai last month, fascinated to see how China had moved on from a century of war and mass starvation to implement the highest-performing education system in the world, according to Pisa.     OECD_RANKING_CHART_0312.png    Despite my expectation that all I would see was a room of robots, the classes I saw, which were made up of pupils largely from low-income communities, were dense, interesting and interactive. While the proportion of English teenagers gaining five good GCSEs has gone from 46% in 2007 to 59% in 2012, it was expected that in this Shanghai school, over 95% of young people would meet national minimum standards. Those who were failing would stay after school to get extra support, with teachers staying in regular contact with the children&apos;s parents. This change has happened throughout Shanghai, with incredibly low between-school variability, thanks to some clear policies and government focus, but most importantly through excellent, well-supported teachers and school leaders. Only the best teachers get promoted and all of them have personal development plans made up of mentoring and observations to help them improve throughout their careers. Shanghai is not perfect. There is a lack of individualism that does not fit our British strengths and many of these policies are forced on schools, children and parents through a totalitarian political system ensuring compliance of a kind we would find inappropriate. Still, my greatest worry is that we look at Asian countries at the top of the Pisa rankings - punctuated by the likes of Switzerland or Liechtenstein - and think that only these different systems have any hope of succeeding. That would be a shame. The results of countries with similar cultural backgrounds and economies to ours \u2013 such as Canada, which scores above the global average \u2013 show what is possible. Similarly, the changes in London over the last five years, where passes in GCSE results have gone from around 40% to over 60%, show that change is possible even closer to home. What the highest-performing systems have in common with Shanghai and elsewhere are a few clear things: high expectations of their pupils, regardless of their background; excellent quality teachers and school leadership; constant and high-quality training for the professionals in schools; and excellent parental involvement. Where we&apos;ve seen systemic change, long-term political consensus on educational goals has been critical. Not simple to achieve, but not impossible either.

The results of the OECD&apos;s programme for international student assessment \u2013 a triennial exam for 15-year-olds known as Pisa \u2013 show that China&apos;s Shanghai region easily tops the rest of the world in maths, reading and science. Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea made up the rest of the top five for maths, followed by the Chinese island of Macao. Elsewhere, Pisa results were a further disappointment for the US, which saw its maths rank fall to 36th place overall, worse than its 2009 performance, which President Obama dubbed a &quot;Sputnik moment&quot; for American education. In reading, the US fell seven places, to 24th, and in science the country came in 28th, down five. Australia saw a precipitous fall in its maths ranking, from 15th in 2009 to 19th in 2012, as it was overtaken by Poland and the new entrant, Vietnam, which appears in the OECD tables for the first time. Australia&apos;s reading score was little changed but its performance in science slipped from 10th to 16th, tied with Macao. Finland was the highest placed European country, with a top-five performance in science, while Ireland was sixth-equal with Taiwan in reading. In maths, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the Netherlands were the only European entrants in the top 10. The UK&apos;s performance was virtually unchanged from its 2009 results, when its international rankings suffered with the addition of higher-placed new entrants such as Shanghai. It ranked 20th overall for science, 26th for maths and 23rd for reading \u2013 on a par with France and the US, and close to the OECD average for reading and maths. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD&apos;s deputy director for education and skills and co-ordinator of the Pisa programme, said the success of education systems such as Shanghai&apos;s was the result of an emphasis on selecting teachers, as well as prioritising investment in teacher training and development. Shanghai&apos;s lead was so clear that the results were the equivalent of its students having had three additional years of schooling, the OECD estimates. Outside Asia, Brazil, Germany and Mexico have all shown consistent improvement, with Germany, Mexico and Turkey winning praise for improving the performance of their weakest performing students, many of whom were from disadvantaged backgrounds. David Spieghalter, the Winton professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said: &quot;Pisa explores many factors associated with country performance but occasionally seem hasty in assigning reasons for change \u2013 we can&apos;t decide causality from this study, and we should be very cautious in the lessons to be learned.&quot; Spieghalter added: &quot;If Pisa measures anything, it is the ability to do Pisa tests. Aligning policy along a single performance indicator can be damaging. We need to look at the whole picture.&quot; The OECD administered the standardised tests at the end of last year in 34 countries and a total of 64 regions, to 500,000 15-year-olds. According to the findings, girls performed worse than boys in maths exams in 37 regions and countries, although in the majority of cases the gap was small. In most countries the gender gap favoured girls in reading, while in science there was little difference. Schleicher said that the OECD found no evidence from its international analysis that competition between private, state or charter-style schools \u2013 free schools, in the UK \u2013 had any impact on raising standards. &quot;You would expect that systems with greater choice would come out better because you expect competition to raise performance of the high performers and lower performers, and put out of the market schools and systems that do not succeed. But in fact, you don&apos;t see a correlation,&quot; Schleicher said. &quot;Competition alone is not a predictor for better outcomes. And the UK is a good example: a highly competitive school system but still only an average performer.&quot; Instead, Schleicher said parents had higher priorities in choosing schools than simply academic results, according to the OECD&apos;s surveys of parental opinion. &quot;The most important thing for parents is not the performance of the school but what they call a safe school environment. And that is true for privileged and disadvantaged parents,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/dec/02/university-forum-2014-speakers", "sentences": ["He has served as an advocate in Singapore, the US andinternationally for liberal education."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T10:11:30Z", "title": "University Forum 2014 speakers", "tags": ["University Forum"], "article": "Further speakers and sessions to be confirmed Don&apos;t miss out - book today \u00bb Professor Madeleine Atkins, chief executive, Higher Education Funding Council for England     Madeleine Atkins, new chief executive of Hefce.

While the UK spends more on education than most Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member states, it does not make the top 20 for maths, reading or science. Among high-income countries, those who pay teachers more tend to perform betterResults from the study show that best-performing countries tend to pay teachers higher salaries (relative to their per capita GDP). While paying teachers well is only part of the equation, the reports says, &quot;higher salaries can help school systems attract the best candidates to the teaching profession.&quot; Well-being is more important to parents than exam resultsAcross OECD countries, if offered a choice of schools for their child, parents tend to consider &quot;a safe school environment&quot; and &quot;a school&apos;s good reputation&quot; more important than &quot;high academic achievement of students in the school.&quot; Handing power to teachers can boost performanceSystems that provide schools with greater discretion in deciding student-assessment policies, the courses offered, the content of those courses and the textbooks used achieve higher attainment levels. Such autonomy is most effective when an accountability system is used and greater teacher-principal collaboration takes place. Giving schools more responsibility over managing funding appears to be unrelated to a school&apos;s success. Highly-stratified systems do not lead to better resultsIn general, school systems that cater to different students&apos; needs by separating young people into different institutions, grade levels and classes have not succeeded in producing superior overall attainment. In such systems, the influence a student&apos;s socio-economic status bears on their academic performance is far stronger and young people tend to be less motivated. Teacher-student relations matter \u2013 and they&apos;re improvingAmong students with equal performance and similar socio-economic status, those who attend schools with better teacher-student relations report a stronger sense of belonging and greater intrinsic motivation to learn. Teacher-student relations improved between 2003 and 2012 in all but one country, Tunisia, where they remained stable.  Most heads believe morale is high91% of students attend schools whose principals agree that the morale of their teachers is high, while 94% of students attend schools whose principals agree that teachers work with enthusiasm.  Excellent teaching is vitalCountries that have improved their performance in Pisa \u2013 such as Estonia, Poland, Brazil, Colombia, Japan and Israel \u2013 have created policies aimed at enhancing the quality of their teaching staff. This includes making it harder to earn a teaching license, providing incentives for high-achieving students to enter the profession, increasing salaries, and offering incentives for teachers to engage in in-service teacher-training programmes. More school systems are prioritising performance dataThe percentage of students who attended schools that use assessment data to compare themselves to other schools increased from 40% in 2003 to 52% in 2012. The use of student-assessment data to compare against national or regional benchmarks or with other schools increased most notably in Brazil, Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal, and declined only in Finland during the same period. Most UK heads say behaviour is not a major disruption to classesSome 89% of students are in schools whose principals report that learning is not at all or very little hindered by students intimidating or bullying other students. Some 95% of students or more in Montenegro, Indonesia, Albania, the Slovak Republic, Latvia, the United Kingdom, Romania, Spain, Japan, Singapore, Lithuania and Iceland attend such schools. More than 20% of students in Kazakhstan, Shanghai-China, Finland, Colombia, the Netherlands, Brazil, Korea and Tunisia attend schools where learning is hindered by students intimidating or bullying others to some extent or a lot.

Or &quot;unpleasant whiff of eugenics,&quot; as Tris loftily described the London mayor&apos;s analysis of Britain&apos;s 2% super-elite and 16% layer of also-rans. Apart from that, petty point-scoring was all the rage as Michael Gove unveiled the OECD&apos;s verdict on the four home countries. They&apos;re all a bit average (Labour-run Wales is especially average) and must do better if they are ever to catch up with elite Asian education systems like those of Hong Kong, Singapore, Shanghai and (nowadays) Eton. Closer to home Tuesday&apos;s results sounded a bit like the European Championship \u2013 England beaten at home by Poland as well as Germany, Wales struggling, all weak on vital subjects such as maths, physics and penalty shoot-outs. In his cocky 2% way the education secretary means well and tries to be good. In rare reflective moments he knows that no one country has all the answers and that humility is best. After all, as Hunt was even keener to mention than von Boris&apos;s gaffe, Sweden \u2013 Gove&apos;s 2008 free schools pin-up \u2013 has since gone straight down the OECD tubes. It is now the Wales of Scandinavia while England is saddled with free school mania, last year&apos;s fad. But Gove just can&apos;t resist putting the petty-pointed boot in. He does so with the confident patter of a door-to-door annuity salesman. Labour&apos;s 13 wasted years are to blame for our indifferent showing in the worldwide study known as &quot;Pisa tests&quot; he kept telling the customers. He was especially harsh on Labour&apos;s craven subservience to swivel-eyed teachers&apos; unions, the people who condemn kids to work down coal mines which have closed. Hard to believe that Gove was once a union militant himself. Strange to report too, Labour deserves no credit on Planet Gove for what the minister called &quot;the best generation of young teachers ever in our schools.&quot; Even Hunt, a blond demigod of good 2% family who would be spared in any Boris euthanasia plan, spotted that one. Jolly unfair, he said. &quot;The secretary of state cannot have it both ways.&quot; Oh yes he could, and did. So did knuckle-dragging Tory fundamentalists, some of whose families have not seen the inside of a state school for generations. Hunt got a riff going about the Lib Dems joining Labour to stop the scandalous hire of unqualified teachers. He conjured up an updated vision of Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Llanabba school (yes, it&apos;s in Wales), run by a dodgy Dr Fagan, awash with paedophile teachers and innocent, unqualified Paul Pennyfeather, a victim of Bullingdon Club bullies, probably led by von Boris. It was a good try but Gove kept insisting there are fewer Paul Pennyfeathers in our schools than in 2010, just more of them in free schools. He also had fun urging Labour MPs who he identified as Blairites, such as Luciana Berger, to stick to their fallen leader&apos;s vision for academic excellence, which Brownite counter-revolutionaries had overthrown. Labour Wales is an object lesson in what not to do, said the ex-militant Scot. It was shameless, but enjoyable. Being Gove he sidestepped suggestions that, after almost four years in office, he might bear some responsibility for our disappointing Pisa. The OECD says it&apos;s far too soon, he explained. That&apos;s not what you told me after four years in your job, said David Blunkett. But nothing stops Gove for long. When Tory Peter Bone quoted a headteacher saying the secretary of state &quot;is a dreadful person and absolutely hopeless&quot; but has the right policies, he took it as a compliment.

Responding to the OECD&apos;s programme for international student achievement (Pisa) \u2013 which showed no improvement compared with the previous rankings in 2009 \u2013 Gove said: &quot;For all the well-intentioned efforts of past governments, we are still falling further behind the best-performing school systems in the world.&quot;In Shanghai and Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong \u2013 indeed even in Taiwan and Vietnam \u2013 children are learning more and performing better with every year that passes, leaving our children behind in the global race.&quot; The OECD compiled the data for Pisa from the results of triennial tests in maths, science and reading given to 15-year-olds in the 65 countries and regions taking part. Overall, the UK was 21st for science, 23rd for reading and 26th for maths \u2013 a slight improvement in maths and reading offset by a decline in its world ranking in science, having been 16th in 2009. The previous rankings saw a sharp fall in the UK&apos;s overall standings, but this time its position was static, according to the OECD&apos;s Pisa co-ordinator, Andreas Schleicher: &quot;In essence you can say that the UK stands where it stood in 2009.&quot; &quot;UK schools are treading water when we know that matching the very best could boost the growth rate by one percentage point every year,&quot; said Katja Hall, the CBI&apos;s chief policy director. The top five places in maths were taken by the emerging economies of east Asia, with China&apos;s Shanghai region comfortably at the top, followed by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. In Shanghai \u2013 a region of 20 million people \u2013 55% of students who took the maths test finished in the top two grades, compared with just 12% in the UK. Will Paxton, head of education for Save the Children, said: &quot;Looking at the countries which have started to leap ahead, one lesson stands out: they focus on ensuring no child falls behind in their education. &quot;We will never catch up with other countries without better early action when children are in primary school to make sure the poorest do not fall behind, particularly in key skills like maths and reading.&quot; Gove told parliament that it was too soon to see improvements as a result of changes introduced since 2010, but maintained that his reforms would improve England&apos;s standing. &quot;There is a strong correlation in these league tables between freedom for heads and improved results,&quot; Gove said. &quot;That is why we have dramatically increased the number of academies and free schools, and given heads more control over teacher training, continuous professional development and the improvement of under-performing schools.&quot; But Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said Gove&apos;s determination that free schools and academies could hire untrained teachers was a recipe for further decline. Describing the Pisa result as &quot;a wake-up call,&quot; Hunt said Asia&apos;s top-performing regions employed highly qualified teachers and used strong networks of co-operation between schools. &quot;The lesson from Pisa is clear, that you have freedom with accountability, autonomy with minimum standards, or else you end up with the secretary of state&apos;s Al-Madinah school,&quot; Hunt said, referring to a controversial free school in Derby which has had its management replaced by the Department for Education. The education department said the maths results meant that 15-year-olds in the UK were three years behind their peers in Shanghai and two years behind those in Singapore, as well as a year behind those in the Netherlands. The government has recently approved a much tougher maths course at GCSE level in England, described by Mark Dawe, head of the OCR examination board, as &quot;a once in a generation opportunity to reduce the tidal wave of people moving into adult life without the skills to reach their full potential&quot;. Switzerland, the Netherlands and Finland were among the leading European nations, with Poland and Germany boasting improved results from previous years. But Sweden \u2013 previously held up as a model by Gove for its adoption of free schools, many run by for-profit companies \u2013 was shown to have suffered a swift decline, sparking a political debate within Sweden about the role of free schools. In recent months several free school chains in Sweden have been closed or collapsed. When the results for the UK were broken down by nation, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland showed results that were very similar. But Wales dipped further down, dropping from the equivalent of 20th in science to 36th and from 27th in reading to 41st. The weak results from Wales allowed Gove to claim that the Labour government in Cardiff &quot;acts almost as a control sample,&quot; saying: &quot;It is an object lesson in what happens when you abandon reform.&quot; Huw Lewis, education minister in the Welsh government, said: &quot;Everybody working in and around the Welsh education sector needs to take a long hard look in the mirror this week. The Pisa results are stark and the message is very clear, we must improve educational attainment and standards right across the board.&quot; Lewis said that reforms \u2013 including new reading and numeracy tests, secondary school banding, and extra funding for new schools \u2013 had been introduced since 2009. &quot;There are signs of some progress in reading, but significant improvement was never likely at this stage,&quot; he said. The US had the humiliation of seeing its performance in reading, maths and science surpassed by Vietnam, which entered Pisa for the first time. American students scored below average in maths and average for reading and science, with US education secretary Arne Duncan describing the results as a &quot;picture of educational stagnation&quot;. The Pisa tests Pisa is based on a set of exams in reading, maths and science administered to a representative sample of 15-year-olds in countries that pay to take part. In 2012 some 510,000 pupils in 65 countries and regions took the paper-based exams, each two hours long and asking a mixture of multiple-choice questions and written responses. The questions are divided into six levels of difficulty and are designed to test problem-solving rather than knowledge. Nine of the world&apos;s 20 largest countries did not take part in Pisa 2012, including India and Bangladesh, while Tunisia was the only African country to take part. Although the government of China holds the exam in multiple provinces, it only releases the results from Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao. Pisa was first launched in 2000. Alongside the tests, the OECD conducts surveys of pupils, parents and school officials, as well as analysing the exam results by gender and socio-economic context."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/dec/03/britain-ranking-global-education-league", "sentences": ["Can we please stop beating ourselves up and vilifying our teachers.Trevor RandallGreat Missenden, Buckinghamshire \u2022\u2008Michael Gove claims that England&apos;s &quot;mediocre&quot; ranking is the fault of Labour education policies to which current 15-year-olds were subjected, and Tristram Hunt retorts that the results show that England needs to emulate high-ranking countries such as Singapore (Report, 2 December).", "We do not know what characteristics of the English, Singaporean or any other system may be responsible for its performance."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T21:00:00Z", "title": "Britain's ranking in the global education league", "tags": ["Education policy", "Education", "Politics", "OECD", "Global economy", "Business"], "article": "Peter Wilby is right to challenge the reliability and relevance of the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests (Don&apos;t let a dubious test dictate how we educate, 2 December). Likewise when he writes that behind the tests &quot;lies an ideology that accepts economic growth and competiveness as the sole aims of schooling&quot;. No surprise, since Pisa is run by the OECD, which was established in 1960 to achieve &quot;the highest sustainable economic growth&quot;. Since then it is apparent to many that economic growth is a prime driver of global warming and &quot;sustainability&quot; has been lost in economic chaos. As Wilby says, &quot;Might justice, social harmony and a clean environment be just as important for our children&apos;s future as economic prosperity?&quot; It is time that the OECD not only drops the farce of Pisa tests but realigns its aims with the needs of a world that is getting warmer, hungry and angry at injustice. Professor Michael BasseyNewark, Nottinghamshire \u2022\u2008Why have these tests at all? Most teachers can tell us, very cheaply, how well children are performing, who is doing well, who needs more support, without the complicated, expensive and often invalid rigmarole of formal testing. Nowhere in the workplace are people subject to such regimes. Workers are not sat down in serried ranks and given unseen papers to test how well they do their jobs! Such a procedure would be preposterous \u2013 and it is no less preposterous when applied to students.Roy BoffyAldridge, Walsall \u2022\u2008The news that British schools have not improved their position in the Pisa league tables will come as no surprise at all to anyone who has read Fiona Millar&apos;s article on the people who advise political parties in their education policies (Who has all the big ideas?, 3 November). As the majority of advisers and members of thinktanks are privately educated with Oxbridge degrees, they are hardly likely to have the knowledge and expertise to come up with ideas to improve the quality of education in our primary and secondary state schools. On the other hand, the Pisa results are surprising in view of the dramatic improvements in teaching, the increased enthusiasm of the teachers and the huge increase in pupil effort I have witnessed in over 40 years of teaching. Perhaps the constant changes to curriculum, &quot;best practice&quot; and the Ofsted criteria for judging schools and teachers might have something to do with it? Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022\u2008Twenty-five years of the national curriculum, political micromanagement of the syllabus and pedagogy, more than a decade of dismantling the reforms of comprehensive schooling, and years of a punitive Ofsted regime, and what has all this upheaval, stress and coercion actually achieved? Unfortunately, the government response seems to be: &quot;the beatings will continue until morale improves&quot;. A\u00a0cheerier way of reading the results, however, may be to view them as a triumph for those teachers, pupils and families who have managed to maintain standards despite the ideological havoc unfolding around them. Professor Donald GilliesYork \u2022\u2008I have produced a mini league table for mathematics (dividing actual scores by 5.54 to give Korea 100): Korea 100; Japan\u00a097; Germany 93; France 89; UK 89. I think we did very well and our students enjoy school: they also have a life outside it. Can we please stop beating ourselves up and vilifying our teachers.Trevor RandallGreat Missenden, Buckinghamshire \u2022\u2008Michael Gove claims that England&apos;s &quot;mediocre&quot; ranking is the fault of Labour education policies to which current 15-year-olds were subjected, and Tristram Hunt retorts that the results show that England needs to emulate high-ranking countries such as Singapore (Report, 2 December). Both interpretations are fallacious. We do not know what characteristics of the English, Singaporean or any other system may be responsible for its performance. Even if one is prepared to assume that these tests are valid, and there is good research evidence to question such an assumption, it is obvious that countries will do better than others for a myriad of possible reasons. These include cultural differences, economic status, emphasis on test techniques, as well as genuine differences in performance. The results of the P tests tell us virtually nothing about the causes of country differences. The best thing to do with these results would be for policymakers to shrug their shoulders, stop making simplistic comparisons, ignore the hype and work out whether Pisa is value for money.Harvey GoldsteinProfessor of social statistics, University of\u00a0Bristol \u2022\u2008More than 25 years ago the Guardian said &quot;a succession of studies have shown that the UK lags far behind German [sic], Japan and France in mathematical education&quot; (Editorial, 24 February 1988) and that &quot;there is no longer one study but several showing British children lagging behind their German contemporaries. The bottom 40 per cent are now two years behind their German contempories [sic] at 14&quot; (Editorial, 23 March 1988). I decided, for my dissertation, to investigate the provenance of these claims. I discovered that they were based on extrapolations of doubtful validity on original data that were of questionable value. Leeds University awarded me a distinction for my pains, and offered its facilities to get my &quot;astounding&quot; findings published. Alas, none of the relevant journals would accept my article and even the Guardian failed to publish a summary. A colleague explained that it was difficult to get publication for articles that were not &quot;fashionable&quot; (ie supported rather than criticised British education).

Significant achievement gaps remain in Australia based on gender, Indigenous status, location and wealth. The difference between students from the highest and lowest socio-economic categories is equivalent to two-and-a-half years of schooling, according to an analysis conducted by the Australian council for educational research (ACER). Australia\u2019s biggest decline in the OECD\u2019s programme for international student assessment was in the mathematics section, in a finding immediately seized on by the Abbott government as evidence more money for schools did not improve results. The government also portrayed the figures as a repudiation of the long-running education union policy to reduce class sizes. But Labor and the Greens argued the results were a \u201cwake up call\u201d showing the importance of fully implementing the needs-based funding system outlined by David Gonski\u2019s review, ensuring the aim was not undermined by freedom for states to cut their contributions. The education minister, Christopher Pyne, said Australia\u2019s international ranking in mathematical literacy had dropped from 15th in 2009 to 19th in 2012, while its ranking in scientific literacy fell from 10th to 16th, and its placing in reading literacy decreased from 9th to 14th. These ranking are based on the raw mean scores. But taking into account statistically insignificant differences between countries and economies, Australia performed equal 17th in mathematics, equal 8th in science and equal 10th in reading, according to analysis conducted by ACER. Asian nations and economies again dominated the results, with Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, Chinese Taipei, Korea, Macao and Japan leading the pack in mathematical literacy. Australia was also outperformed by Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Netherlands, Estonia, Finland, Canada, Poland, Belgium and Germany. PISA testing of 15-year-old students occurs every three years. The director of educational monitoring and research at ACER, Sue Thomson, said Australia\u2019s slip backwards in mathematics and reading skills over the past decade was cause for concern. She said the mean mathematical literacy performance declined between 2003 and 2012 by the equivalent of more than half a year of schooling. \u201cWhile the maths and reading skills of Australian students have been declining, countries such as Poland and Ireland have improved their performance, enabling them to leapfrog over Australia. Poland has been steadily improving since 2000 and is now ahead of Australia in maths, while Ireland has successfully reversed its own downward trend and now outperforms Australia in reading,\u201d she said in a statement. Thomson said Australia\u2019s mathematical literacy performance declined more for girls than it did for boys. \u201cWhile the overall PISA mathematics score for Australia is still higher than the OECD average, the score for girls has dropped so it is equal to the OECD average. Further, student questionnaire responses collected as part of PISA reveal that Australian girls hold much more negative beliefs than Australian boys about mathematics and learning mathematics.\u201d Days after he found an extra $1.2bn for school funding, restoring the original $2.8bn four-year commitment, Pyne said the results showed more funding did not equate to better outcomes. Pyne said results were declining despite big increases in education spending over the past decade, including on laptops and school halls. He argued teacher quality was critical to lifting student outcomes. He was concerned Australia\u2019s high performing students were not doing as well as students from other countries and its low performing students were struggling. \u201cWe must take note of the decline in our international performance. PISA shows us that our education system is high-equity where socio-economic status matters less when compared to other OECD countries, but there is a large variation in individual schools between high performing and low performing students,\u201d Pyne said in a statement. The education minister later took a swipe at the political Left for being \u201cmesmerised\u201d by teacher-student ratios, saying Australia\u2019s class sizes were below the OECD average yet had not stopped the decline in outcomes. But he told reporters he would leave it up to the states, territories and non-government school sector to decide their own policies on class sizes. The Greens argued the results should place act as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the Abbott government over the need to fully implement the needs-based school funding reforms in every state and territory. The party\u2019s spokeswoman on schools, Penny Wright, said Australia had a large gap between the highest and lowest performing students. \u201cBy ditching the Gonski model in favour of no-strings-attached funding for Queensland, the Northern Territory and Queensland, Mr Abbott and Mr Pyne are ensuring disadvantage will continue, holding back Australia\u2019s global performance,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt is deplorable that in the 21st century, indigenous students are two and a half years behind non-indigenous students, and that kids in remote areas are as much as 18 months behind children in the city.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the government should not conclude from the results that the answer was not to increase school funding. He said Labor had done its \u201chomework\u201d by commissioning the Gonski review and demanded it be implemented in full. \u201cNow if you&apos;re going to change something as big as the educational ship of state and make it steer in a different direction you can&apos;t do that overnight,\u201d Shorten said.

But, according to the Ethical Consumer website, these are all practices in which the UK&apos;s leading banks have been implicated and, as a result any charities that bank with them are effectively allowing their funds to be used for these activities. What may be surprising is the scale of charities&apos; involvement. Recent research using the Charity Financials data tool found that three-quarters of the 5,000 largest charities are with one of the big four banks or their subsidiaries. Barclays&apos; customers include the National Trust, the British Heart Foundation and Barnardo&apos;s, while RBS/Natwest&apos;s include Oxfam GB, Save the Children and the British Red Cross. Putting aside the polemic, there are reasons why charities are sticking with the banking giants. A major one is that the sector is diverse, and many non-profit organisations don&apos;t have a strong interest in the sorts of abuses with which banks have been linked. Therefore, while environment-focused charities such as WWF UK (which is with the Co-operative Bank) and tax haven campaigners such as ActionAid (which recently moved from Barclays to the Co-op) place high value on ethical conduct, medical or educational charities may not be so concerned. As Jane Tully, head of policy and public affairs at the Charity Finance Group that promotes best practice, puts it: &quot;Decisions about banking are informed by a range of factors, one of which may be the charity&apos;s ethics. But determining ethics can be difficult as it is so subjective. A clearer starting point can be mission, and trying to ensure banking practices don&apos;t run contrary to that.&quot; Reality cheque Unfortunately, even those charities that do place a strong emphasis on ethics are encountering obstacles. Forum for the Future works with businesses and government to promote sustainability and and had used the Co-op as its main banker since 1994, but this year it reluctantly took the decision to move to HSBC. Of course, the Co-op&apos;s recent financial troubles have been well documented, and it is unclear at this stage whether the new owners will retain its ethical principles. However, although news of the bank&apos;s financial difficulties was emerging at the time of the decision, director of finance and operations Rosalyn Parker emphasises that the move was primarily to facilitate the charity&apos;s expansion into Singapore, Mumbai and New York. &quot;We&apos;ve been with the Co-op so long,&quot; says director of finance and operations Rosalyn Parker, &quot;and we understand it supports a lot of charities, so we didn&apos;t really want to walk away. However, we didn&apos;t want to have to have local banks in each of the regions, so we had little option but to move to one of the bigger banks.&quot; The charity also holds deposit accounts with Triodos, CCLA and the Co-op, and in this respect is still able to satisfy its ethical preferences. Parker admits, however, that this may come at a financial cost. &quot;It certainly gives you less choice in the market; you probably don&apos;t get such good interest rates. We were keen to have an account with Triodos, and that was more important to us than to get a slightly better rate.&quot; Transaction costs Another organisation that has had to make compromises is Launchpad Reading, a homelessness charity. Adrian Pearson, its finance and administration manager, emphasises that the charity&apos;s banking policy reflects its charitable objectives and therefore considers social and environmental factors. However, while it has savings and investment facilities with Triodos, cost issues mean that its main banking is with Barclays. &quot;For the nature of the business we&apos;ve got, the way that our money comes in, and the way charges work across the ethical banking sector, the only one that was in a position to offer competitive costs compared to the big four was the Co-op. That was an option we looked at earlier this year, but given the problems they have been having, we decided not to pursue it.&quot; He adds: &quot;We have a reasonably high volume of transactions with a relatively low value, so where there are transaction charges, particularly on receipt; we will feel those quite disproportionately.&quot; For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, join our community"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/05/qantas-ceo-calls-for-level-playing-field-with-virgin-as-axe-falls-on-1000-jobs", "sentences": ["Virgin is majority-owned by state-backed carriers Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-05T09:56:30Z", "title": "Qantas CEO calls for level playing field with Virgin as axe falls on 1,000 jobs", "tags": ["Qantas", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Airline industry"], "article": "Qantas is seeking legislative changes from the federal government to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d with its rival Virgin after it announced 1,000 job losses, foreshadowed its first loss in the six months to December and announced cost-cutting to save $2bn over three years. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, complained the airline was shackled with legislated foreign ownership restrictions while Virgin was enjoying a massive cash injection from its foreign state-owned enterprise shareholders while continuing to be designated an Australian airline. Joyce phoned the treasurer, Joe Hockey, the transport minister, Warren Truss, and the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, immediately after issuing a statement to the stock exchange. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, said he \u201cgrieved for every worker whose job has been lost\u201d, but the best thing he could do was strengthen the economy. \u201cWhile I don\u2019t say there is any one measure which is some kind of magic wand \u2026 we have to get taxes down, regulations down \u2026 we have made a very good start and it would be even better if members opposite would not constantly try to oppose the policies we took to the election,\u201d he said. Hockey was even more blunt. \u201cThe government can\u2019t do a hell of a lot other than ensure you have a stronger economy that ensures that all businesses have a chance to continue to grow and not only hold their employees but employee more people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is that governments should not be in the business of propping up private sector operations.\u201d He said taxpayers needed to decide whether having a national carrier, with the legislative restrictions that entailed, was worth the cost necessary to continue the arrangement. \u201cThe issues with Qantas is that it has restrictions on its ownership that are imposed by the parliament,\u201d he told Channel Ten. \u201cAnd if the parliament wants to continue with those restrictions then taxpayers have to be prepared to foot the bill. \u201cThat is not going to be a cheap process. So really, the reason why I opened the debate is because the previous government was having these sorts of debate behind closed doors.\u201d The environment minister, Greg Hunt, linked the airline\u2019s woes to the fact that it was \u201cunder real pressure from the carbon tax\u201d. He said the government could fix aviation if the opposition \u201cget out of the way\u201d of the carbon tax repeal. Shorten responded angrily: \u201cStop politicising job losses, shame on you.\u201d He said Joyce \u201cdoes not say carbon had anything to do it\u201d. The government has called for a \u201cnational debate\u201d on the price Australians are prepared to pay to have a national carrier, with suggestions for government intervention including lifting the foreign ownership restriction, making Qantas and Virgin subject to the same restrictions, buying back a stake in the airline which was privatised in 1992 or guaranteeing the airline\u2019s debt. Shorten also called on the government to provide support for the 1,000 workers losing their jobs just before Christmas. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Dave Oliver, called on the government to intervene to provide the carrier with a level playing field and to help the sacked workers. \u201cBefore the election Tony Abbott was running around the nation with a fluoro vest and a hard hat, saying he was all about jobs, well, now is his chance to put his money where his mouth is,\u201d Oliver said. Speaking on Sky, Joyce suggested the government could make Virgin subject to the same restrictions as Qantas \u2013 including the requirement that it be 51% Australian owned. The independent senator Nick Xenophon and Labor senators Glenn Sterle and Alex Gallacher called on Joyce and the entire Qantas board to resign, accusing them of burdening the airline with losses from the Jetstar Asia business. Xenophon said the government should \u201cgo through Qantas\u2019s books\u201d with a forensic accountant before it offered the airline any form of assistance, because \u201cthis whole thing is an absolute disgrace, if you look closely at the Qantas books, Jetstar Asia has been a dud and it has burnt a fortune of Qantas revenue\u201d. \u201cI am alleging the Qantas group is shifting costs from Jetstar Asia onto Qantas,\u201d he said. Qantas stock fell more than 17% immediately after the news The new sackings add to 300 jobs lost after the closure of the airline&apos;s heavy maintenance base in Avalon, Victoria.

The stakes are high for Australia as the secretive negotiations draw to an end, with our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme set to be a hotly contested political issue in the final hours of the talks. The outcome of the debate will have ramifications for all of us. A recently leaked document\u00a0showed the US sees the TPP as a means of extending patent monopolies for its drug companies. Put bluntly, this would increase the cost of medicines\u00a0for all us, hitting with particular force those who are sick and those who can least afford to be coughing up more cash to pay for vital medications. But the TPP also presents a direct threat to the way the PBS operates and its ability to contain costs and ensure value for money.\u00a0America\u2019s pharmaceutical industry association, PhRMA, has flagged that modifying programs for subsidising medicines, including Australia\u2019s PBS, is one of its key objectives. The big transnational drug companies want changes to the rules and processes for listing and pricing drugs. In 2011, a US proposal for an annex to the transparency chapter of the TPP was leaked. This annex specifically targeted programs for subsidising medicines and medical devices. Reports at the time indicated that this proposal, often referred to as the \u201chealthcare transparency annex\u201d, was rejected in its entirety by the other TPP countries. No further text from this part of the agreement has been leaked since, although reports suggest that a revised (but probably not very different) version was tabled by the US in September 2012 in a second unsuccessful attempt to persuade the other TPP parties to change their processes for pricing and subsidising drugs. The healthcare transparency annex presents an insidious threat to the effective operation of the PBS. While it is framed in terms of increasing transparency and \u201cprocedural fairness\u201d, the real objectives of the US are to limit the ability of countries to regulate prices, and to increase the opportunities for pharmaceutical industry involvement in decision making. The annex will rule out an important pricing mechanism used in the PBS to keep prices low and ensure value for money, known as \u201ctherapeutic reference pricing\u201d. This mechanism means that the prices of new drugs are linked with the prices of existing drugs that are already available for the same condition. But under the draft annex, the value of a drug would instead be determined by whether or not it is under patent. The 2011 draft of the annex also included an appeals mechanism that would give the pharmaceutical industry more rights than the limited review process we currently have in Australia. Unlike the current independent reviews, the appeals mechanism sought by the US would enable drug companies to challenge, and potentially overturn, any aspect of decision making about whether to list a drug on the PBS and how much to pay for it. The 2011 draft annex included many other provisions that would force the PBS to disclose more information about its determinations and decision criteria, disclose the membership of committees and provide more opportunities for pharmaceutical industry input at various points in the process. Despite the rhetoric of transparency and fairness, requirements like these only benefit industry stakeholders, and make it more difficult for health systems to contain pharmaceutical costs. Rising pharmaceutical expenditure brings with it opportunity costs \u2013 more money spent on drugs means less to spend on other health services and preventive health care \u2013 and the need for increased patient co-payments. In other words, it is people who bear the costs, in one way or another, when the pharmaceutical industry is provided with extra privileges. The pharmaceutical industry claims that concerns about the PBS are exaggerated since similar concerns at the time of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement were, on the whole, not borne out in the final text of that agreement. But comparison of the TPP text with the pharmaceuticals annex in the bilateral agreement shows that the provisions proposed for the TPP are far more intrusive and pose a much greater threat to the PBS than those in the AUSFTA. It is highly concerning to public health advocates that the future of the PBS remains undecided at this late stage in the negotiations. The minister for trade and investment, Andrew Robb, recently made a statement that \u201cThe Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an integral part of Australia&apos;s health system and the Government will not permit any outcome in its trade negotiations which undermines the PBS or Australia&apos;s health system more generally.\u201d But trade negotiations involve compromises and trade-offs, and increasing access to overseas markets for our agricultural and other exports is a high priority to the current government. And it seems extremely unlikely, given the influence of the powerful pharmaceutical industry lobby, that the US will give up its ambitions for our PBS. The final meeting for the TPP in Singapore this weekend could find Andrew Robb with a list of market access priorities in one hand and a list of politically sensitive, potential trade-offs in the other. The PBS could well be on that list.\u00a0What plays out could prove to be a bitter pill to swallow for Australia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/06/holden-wont-get-extra-money-says-tony-abbott", "sentences": ["Devereux has been promoted to a regional management role with General Motors, based in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-06T02:06:45Z", "title": "Holden won't get extra money, says Tony Abbott", "tags": ["Automotive industry", "Tony Abbott", "Australian politics", "Australia news"], "article": "The prime minister has called on car manufacturer Holden to put up or shut up, and says the Coalition has no plans to reverse its pre-election commitment to cut future taxpayer assistance to the automotive industry.

Given he faces considerable internal resistance to provide more funds for the carmakers, the federal industry minister, Ian Macfarlane, has been suggesting publicly since October that he might shuffle the existing car industry funding in order to provide some short-term relief for Holden. Macfarlane has been battling pushback from economic ministers, treasurer Joe Hockey and finance minister Mathias Cormann, who are yet to be convinced about the merits of ongoing assistance to automotive manufacturing. The industry minister has indicated he could reorganise funds from within the existing Automotive Transformation Scheme. The ATS runs from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2020 and includes capped assistance of $1.5bn from 2011 to 2015; capped assistance of $1bn from 2016 to 2020; and uncapped assistance of approximately $847m. Macfarlane has been in touch with Holden executives this week and believes the company is yet to make a final call on the Australian business. Macfarlane told Guardian Australia the government wanted a strong manufacturing sector and a &quot;sustainable car industry.&quot; Abbott&apos;s call for Holden to clarify its future comes as the inquiry into the car industry established by his government has only just begun. The Productivity Commission is not due to deliver its interim findings until 20 December and it has until the end of March 2014 to deliver its final report. Macfarlane said the Productivity Commission would complete its current work. \u201cThe government has made clear from day one the timetable for its response, and neither Holden nor Toyota have raised any concerns about that timetable. Consultations are continuing in good faith with Australian car makers, the components industry and workers.&quot; \u201cThese consultations will continue as the Productivity Commission prepares its interim findings, ahead of a full report next March, and a government response by mid 2014.\u201d The managing director of Holden, Mike Devereux, is not due to give evidence to the PC inquiry until next Tuesday, 10 December, although the carmaker has made a written submission which says that continued industry assistance is needed to win $1bn in investment needed to keep its Australian manufacturing operations open after 2016. A Holden spokesman has refused to comment on the most recent ABC report quoting unnamed senior Abbott ministers saying that a decision has already been made for Holden to stop making cars at its Adelaide plant: \u201cWe do not respond to speculation. Our discussions with government are continuing.\u201d The South Australian secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, John Camillo, said Devereux had addressed workers at the Adelaide assembly plant on Thursday, telling them that employees would be the first to hear if any decision was made on the future of the plant. Devereux has been promoted to a regional management role with General Motors, based in Singapore. But he told Holden workers that he would continue to run Holden at the Australian operation until at least February, when a new appointee takes over. Camillo said he had spoken to the SA premier, Jay Weatherill, who had been told by Holden that no decision had been made to shut the plant. But the union leader said he walked the factory floor early Friday morning and that workers were &quot;pretty emotional&quot; about the latest speculative reports quoting an unnamed senior Coalition minister saying that Holden has already made a decision to shut the plant. He said senior figures in the Abbott government appeared to want GM to make a decision, allowing them to argue &quot;hang on, GM left of its own accord\u201d. ACTU secretary Dave Oliver called for urgent action from the government, warning that the PC inquiry could turn into an inquest into the death of the local car industry. Shadow industry minister Kim Carr has meanwhile urged the government to desist from a \u201cfactional fight\u201d and focus on agreeing on a plan to shore up Holden. \u201cWe understand that no decision has yet been made by GM Holden, however it is on a knife\u2019s edge.\u201d Car industry sources say that Holden&apos;s parent, the US auto giant General Motors, has noted the government&apos;s lukewarm stance to its Australian presence, and that the parent is leaving it to local management to try to put in place a survival package. While there is opposition to continued taxpayer assistance to the car industry among the government&apos;s economic dries, there is strong support among state-based Coalition MPs in South Australia and Victoria. The car industry supports about 45,000 direct jobs, with proponents arguing that it sustains about 200,000 jobs overall. The closure of Holden&apos;s assembly plant in Adelaide would be a massive blow to the SA economy and there is a state election in mid-March at which the Coalition is keen to oust the incumbent Labor administration.

He then compounded the problem by criticising Mexican fans, journalists and organisers alike during a &quot;friendly&quot; at the Azteca in 1969, at one point chasing several hacks away from England&apos;s dressing room door while waving his fist in the &apos;Emotionally Engaged&apos; style. As a result, England were given pelters during the entirety of their stay at the 1970 World Cup, to the point that after their quarter-final defeat to West Germany, the happy city of Le\u00f3n resembled a large Bavarian bierkeller on the first day in November. Fast forward 44 years, and Hodgson is telling anyone who&apos;ll listen to him deliver one of his trademark 978-minute soliloquies that &quot;Manaus is the place ideally to avoid&quot;. In fairness to the man, he&apos;s only talking about the temperature and humidity of the city, which is not easy to run about in at full pelt \u2013 &quot;You have a better chance if you get one of the venues where the climate is kinder&quot; \u2013 but on the other hand Hodgson is sold to the public as a cut above the average manager in terms of intelligence, and avoiding this sort of stuff is Public Relations 101. You know what&apos;s coming. &quot;We would also prefer that England doesn&apos;t come,&quot; retorted Arthur Virgilio, the piqued mayor o&apos; Manaus. &quot;We hope to get a better team and a coach who is more sensible and polite. He&apos;s one of the few people in the world who is not curious about the Amazon, who doesn&apos;t want to know about Manaus. To make excuses shows lack of enthusiasm and self-confidence.&quot; The very thought! Unlike Mr Roy, Virgilio has read his copy of Public Relations for People Who Have To Do Stuff Like Public Relations (And Dummies) from cover to cover, and was quick to add that &quot;fortunately the English people are different than Mr Hodgson. It&apos;s polite to be able to value what is beautiful. And nothing is more beautiful than Amazonia, Amazonas and Manaus.&quot; So if England&apos;s travails at Mexico &apos;70 are to be any guide, that&apos;s Hodgson&apos;s team getting no sleep at their team hotel, with irritated locals hanging around outside, operating their car horns, radios and mouths until the early hours. Bring on Argentina, Italy, USA and Ghana in this afternoon&apos;s draw, then! England will be hot, out of breath, and deprived of kip, so it makes little difference now. \u2022 Live on Big Website now: join Scott Murray for the World Cup 2014 finals draw QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;There&apos;s no such thing as coming back and being a hero, that&apos;s the biggest mistake you can make.

BITS AND BOBS Despite losing to Everton in midweek, David Moyes retained his bullish, buccaneering, swashbuckling, devil-may-care attitude before United&apos;s weekend fixture. &quot;It could be a bad time to face Newcastle,&quot; he said. &quot;They are coming to Old Trafford and we will make it as hard and as difficult for them as possible.&quot; Newcastle have not won at Old Trafford in 41-and-a-half years. Dinky Everton manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez seems to have recovered from a traumatic summer of derision and insult prompted by another club&apos;s attempt to sign his players. &quot;We are going to use the window in January to try to help the team,&quot; he asserted. Nike Football&apos;s Footwear Design Director, Denis Dekovic, is a proud man - and rightly so, after commissioning the world&apos;s first sentient shoe. &quot;It has all the latest technology and performance insights,&quot; he boasted.

I know because I happened to wake to the news of his death in Delhi, where the grieving for Mandela is as intense as anywhere outside South Africa. Like so many other nations, the Indians have been quick to claim the great Madiba as their own. &quot;He was a true Gandhian,&quot; said prime minister Manmohan Singh, casting the ANC leader as an apostle of non-violence, despite Mandela maintaining his belief in the armed struggle to the end, even restating it on his release from jail in 1990. You can hardly blame Singh for wanting to see a parallel. India, like post-apartheid South Africa, is a nation whose foundation story tells of a long struggle against oppression \u2013 led by a virtual saint \u2013 that eventually brought liberation and democracy. That narrative, so cherished in Johannesburg, also endures in Delhi. Indeed, as South Africans contemplate their future, they could do worse than look to the dilemmas now gripping India \u2013 and that goes for the rest of us, too. At first glance, Indian democracy is in rude health. This week I witnessed a record turnout in state-level elections, including 67% in Delhi, as voters jostled to have their say. The young especially were represented in big numbers, either manning the wooden trestle tables outside polling stations or lining up to get their fingers marked with the ink that says they&apos;ve voted. But don&apos;t be misled into thinking that it represents enthusiasm for the current political order. &quot;All they are corrupt,&quot; Abdul Farid, 23 and a student, told me as a crowd of young men gathered to nod their agreement. He wished a plague on both the current houses \u2013 the governing Congress party dominated by the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty and the opposition Hindu nationalists of the BJP \u2013 and was trying the new Common Man party, active only in the capital and founded by a former tax inspector. But India&apos;s pundit class is convinced that the current wave of disenchantment will carry the BJP to power in next spring&apos;s general election, deposing Congress after a decade in power. The immediate explanation for voter disaffection is not hard to fathom. India&apos;s economy is slowing: growth that sat regularly at 9% or more is now less than 5%. Prices are up, investment and industrial production are down and wages are static: it&apos;s that 1970s throwback, stagflation. That&apos;s dented optimism, of course, but it&apos;s also made Indians even more fed-up with corruption. The Congress-led government may promise generous handouts and subsidies to the poor, but too little of that money reaches those who need it. En route, most of it disappears, thanks to what is euphemistically referred to as &quot;leakage&quot;. Jay Panda, well-regarded MP for a regional party, told me that when it comes to subsidised food, only 27% of every rupee spent goes to its intended beneficiary. Sometimes he wonders if &quot;we&apos;d be better off dropping money from a helicopter&quot;. He told me of teachers who gladly bank their government salary, then send a low-paid, less able substitute to teach their class while they run a money-making venture on the side. To say nothing of India&apos;s perennial problems. Half of all Indians, some 600 million people, have no toilet. &quot;This country is floating on shit and no one talks about it,&quot; says columnist Mihir Sharma who, like all those who can afford it, fastidiously drinks bottled water only. So-called &quot;open defecation&quot; is still a part of rural life, while in Delhi, for all the gains of the rising middle class, the people who do the affluent&apos;s washing, clean their homes and drive their taxis rely on communal lavatories, with one toilet used by perhaps 100 people. &quot;Child malnutrition rates are on a par with Somalia and Mali,&quot; says Vinod Mehta, founder editor of Outlook magazine. &quot;That makes us hang our heads in shame.&quot; Indians&apos; readiness to tolerate such conditions is eroding, thanks in part to an ever-expanding electronic media, providing a daily reminder of how (much of) the rest of the world lives. That raises expectations, which the BJP&apos;s charismatic leader, Narendra Modi, \u2013 who has never shaken off accusations of complicity in riots that left 1,000 Muslims dead in 2002 \u2013 is only too happy to exploit. His biography \u2013 from selling tea on railway platforms to the brink of power \u2013 appeals to India&apos;s new aspirational classes. But discontent goes deeper than a mere desire to throw the current lot out. &quot;Some suggest that democracy has not served the people well,&quot; PM Singh said on Friday. Sharma speaks of &quot;authoritarian envy&quot;, as India eyes the likes of Singapore and China, where &quot;if their president says something, it actually gets done.&quot; He, like others I spoke to, worries that the populist Nodi might try to meet that longing, turning into a kind of Indian Putin: &quot;In Russia, there are still elections, but nothing you&apos;d recognise as democracy.&quot; And yet, no matter how strong the desire for efficiency and to break free from the daily chaos \u2013 too many inspectors choking businesses in red tape, too few police keeping order on the streets \u2013 Indians are not about to let go of the self-rule they fought so hard to gain. &apos;Democracy can be infuriating at times, we can all see that,&quot; says the pundit and sometime BJP adviser Swapan Dasgupta, a print of Queen Victoria, Empress of India, on his study wall. &quot;But Indians enjoy their democracy: they cherish it; they relish it,&quot; he says. &quot;Too much order is anathema. You can see that from our traffic!&quot; For him, democracy is essential for a nation as diverse and noisily plural as India, where the banknotes confirm 17 official languages and whose states are as different to each other as the nations of Europe. It may not be efficient, but it means everyone is represented: dissenters have their voice, society has its safety valve. &quot;A problem won&apos;t get resolved, but it will get played out,&quot; says Dasgupta. Others I spoke to said democracy might be the only thing holding India together. There is an important reminder here for those of us who sometimes despair of democracy&apos;s inability to grapple with the greatest, most long-term challenges (with climate change perhaps the chief example). The experience of the world&apos;s largest democracy confirms that efficiency is not the only value \u2013 that democracy does not exist solely to provide good, functioning governance. In diverse societies especially, it meets another need. Perhaps that can be a comfort to South Africans, who despite the liberation of 1994 still live in a society saddled with poverty and inequality. Perhaps it can be a comfort to the rest of us, as we remember the man who fought, above all, for the right to vote. Its shortcomings are great, but democracy is still our best hope.

Critics of the TPP are concerned that the deal could affect anything from the cost of medicines to the intellectual property rights of Australian citizens who compete with competitors in Pacific countries, notably the US. However trade minister Andrew Robb on Monday said no final agreement had been made and he committed not to subscribe to anything not in the interests of the Australian people, including on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, says the disclosure in the Senate of information relating to the multilateral agreement would be prejudicial to Australia\u2019s interests and would breach the government\u2019s commitments to other negotiating nations. \u201cAccordingly and consistent with long standing Senate conventions the government claims public interest immunity in relation to the documents covered by this order,\u201d Cormann said in his letter to the Senate. Whish-Wilson described the Senate order as \u201ca win for every Australian who demanded to know how their farm, small business, cost of medicines, labour rights, internet freedoms, and local environment could be affected by this nation&apos;s biggest ever trade negotiation.\u201d &quot;What this letter says is that the Abbott government will not abide by the will of the Senate to allow all Australians the right to know how the TPPA trade deal will affect their lives and businesses because the United States has not said it is OK to do so,\u201d he said. &quot;The Abbott government has shown contempt for the Senate and the Australian people.\u201d The documents, leaked by WikiLeaks, on Monday, show the negotiating positions of the 12 different nations at 6 November this year, prior to the talks currently occurring in Singapore. One document sets out various positions on intellectual property, public health, climate change, industrial relations, sharing of private information, biodiversity and e-commerce. The other document contains excerpts from documents from \u201cinternal government commentary\u201d. The context is not provided. Matthew Rimmer, an expert in intellectual property and associate professor at the Australian National University, said the leaks show stark divisions in the positions of the Pacific nations. \u201cThese texts show these divisions are not going to be resolved in Singapore,\u201d Rimmer said. \u201cIt shows the US have been unyielding in their negotiations - demanding access to all areas. The US have high-pressure sales tactics but countries which accede to their demands may suffer buyer regret.\u201d Rimmer said the US strategy appeared to be to promise market access in return for pushing its agenda on intellectual property and investment, while isolating smaller countries and breaking down alliances between countries. \u201cDespite countries indulging in \u2018boosterism\u2019 in the past few weeks, the cold hard realities is there is lots of discord,\u201d Rimmer said. The TPP agreement is being negotiated between Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Chile and Singapore, aimed at simplifying trade between the 12 nations. Robb said he remained focused on the benefits for Australia. \u201cI have made it clear from the outset that for Australia, material improvements in terms of market access is of highest priority,\u201d Robb said. \u201cWe are not going to engage in commentary regarding material that purports to be the characterisations of another unnamed country. \u201cAs I have said repeatedly, we will not subscribe to anything that is not in the interests of the Australian public or which undermines our PBS or health system. The mandate provided to me by cabinet is very clear on this.\u201d The Greens have raised alarm over the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism in Australia&apos;s free trade agreement with the Republic of Korea. Robb\u2019s spokesman said the agreement contained &quot;a number of important safeguards and carve-outs to protect our ability to govern in the public interest in areas, such as welfare, health, safety, and the environment&quot;. Whish-Wilson said the Treasury had warned in 2010 against limiting future domestic policy flexibility by agreeing to such dispute settlement provisions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/09/students-protest-grade-complain-university-courses", "sentences": ["The researchers talked with many (specifically: 10) students, who hailed originally from Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong or Taiwan."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T14:00:00Z", "title": "Do students complain about university courses?

But several teams of researchers have tried. One attempted to measure how students complain; another, how they intend to complain. A\u00a0third team tried to gauge students&apos; attitudes to complaining. These are not easy to measure well, or consistently. In 2010, David Hart and Nigel Coates, at Northumbria University&apos;s Newcastle business school, published a study called International Student Complaint Behaviour: How Do East Asian Students Complain To Their University? in the Journal of Further and Higher Education. They interviewed students at a UK higher education institution, but they masked its identity, revealing only that it was &quot;a large UK university&quot; with a total of 31,000 registered students, a staff-to-student ratio of 22:1, and that it &quot;has been ranked 73rd in the 2009 Good University Guide&quot;. The researchers talked with many (specifically: 10) students, who hailed originally from Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Hong Kong or Taiwan. The data accumulated from this sampling led Hart and Coates to the finding that &quot;East Asian students are willing to share their dissatisfactory experiences with university staff&quot;. Hart and Coates caution that their investigation came up against some limits. First, &quot;the fact that the interviews were conducted in English may have presented some problems to the respondents being able to accurately convey their opinions&quot;. Second, their &quot;apparent willingness to complain is mediated by a common fear amongst respondents that complaining about a lecturer or course may affect the grades they receive from the university&quot;. In 2011, At Pace University in New York City, business school researchers Vishal Lala and Randi Priluck surveyed how each of 288 students might intend to go about complaining. Lala and Priluck published a study in the Journal of Marketing Education, in which they announce their major discovery: that &quot;students complain to the school only if the effort involved is minimal and they believe the school will respond&quot;. That&apos;s not the whole story, of course. Lala and Priluck say some students would be inclined to complain not to the school, but to their friends and to &quot;unknown others&quot;. Influenced by &quot;personal characteristics&quot;, some of those would-be complainers say they would complain in person; others indicate a preference for grousing on the web. In 2012, Graham Ferguson and Ian Phau, business school researchers at Curtin University in Perth, peppered survey questions at 462 students in Australia, Indonesia and Malaysia. Ferguson and Phau say the Malaysian students enjoy a &quot;more positive attitude&quot; to complaining than do the Indonesian students, whilst the Indonesians are more positive than the Australians. All three teams \u2013 Hart and Coates, Lala and Priluck, and Ferguson and Phau \u2013 complain, in a positive manner, of a need for further research about student complaining. \u2022 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel prize"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/trans-pacific-partnership-a-guide-to-the-most-contentious-issues", "sentences": ["The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement is being negotiated in Singapore this week between Australia, New Zealand, the US, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Canada, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Japan.", "The talks conclude on Tuesday about 5pm Singapore time."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T04:57:58Z", "title": "Trans-Pacific Partnership: a guide to the most contentious issues", "tags": ["Australian politics", "Australia news", "Business"], "article": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement is being negotiated in Singapore this week between Australia, New Zealand, the US, Peru, Chile, Mexico, Canada, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and Japan. The countries have a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of US$28,136bn on 2012 figures, which represents almost 40% of the world\u2019s GDP. Australian trade within the TPP countries represents A$214,224m. The attempt to create the partnership agreement builds on the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement, established in 2006 between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and ingapore. There have been many contentious issues around the TPP: critics are particularly concerned about the secrecy around the agreement given it has the capacity to change many local laws and regulations affecting Australian people. Essentially, in order to receive access to other markets, Australia is in the process of trading off regulations that stop access by other countries and particularly multinational companies to the Australian market. On Monday, documents were revealed on WikiLeaks relating to meetings on November 6, with a run-down of countries\u2019 positions on each issue though no context was released. So far, the majority of public criticism has centred on arguments relating to intellectual property and the cost of medicines, though many have concerns about environmental issues including climate change, investment, e-commerce and labour laws. The talks conclude on Tuesday about 5pm Singapore time. 1. Intellectual property The US has been rigid in its demands for stronger intellectual property protection to champion the rights of its global giants such as IT companies and its film and music industries. For example, every other country was opposed to the US demands on the term of intellectual rights protection, pharmaceuticals data protection and parallel importation. The latter is the practice where an original product, such as a computer game, is imported from another country and sold without the permission of the owner of the intellectual property right. The US also wants to impose criminal penalties for \u201cunintentional infringements on copyright\u201d. This could include copying movies, games and music. Australia was opposed to this position and was also noted as raising concerns in the pharmaceutical area. 2. Investment The US position on investor-state dispute settlement provision (ISDS) grants foreign companies the right to sue the government under international law. This is particularly controversial as Australia faces a legal case by Philip Morris International based on a Hong Kong trade treaty over Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging laws, even though the company already lost the case in the Australian High Court. Although the Labor government refused to give ground on ISDS, the trade minister, Andrew Robb, is reportedly considering acquiescing for greater access to agricultural markets. Robb has not confirmed that position and has said talks in all areas are continuing. 3. E-commerce All countries accepted there needed to be agreement on privacy obligations with regard to information-sharing, apart from the US, which reserved its position on privacy. The US position has left people wondering whether the TPP will undermine privacy, particularly in the wake of the NSA revelations from the Snowden documents. 4. Medicines and health Australia has worked with the US and Japan on a revised transparency \u201cmedicine annex\u201d proposal in respect of medicines. This annex deals with pharmaceutical pricing and not enough detail has been revealed on this proposal, however we know all other countries have rejected the annex, including New Zealand and Canada. The leaked documents show some countries \u201cexpressed annoyance\u201d that the US just resubmitted a text that had been strongly rejected previously. The US is also reportedly seeking to pressure Australia to open up a contract held by CSL for blood separation because it allows the manufacture of lucrative blood products. Australia is resisting that pressure. 5. Environment There appear to be deep divisions on environment and climate change, with the US and Australia opposing any extension of the text on climate matters. Of particular concern is whether the TPP undermines action on climate change, given the Coalition\u2019s opposition to carbon pricing and the divided position in the US. Details have not been released. 6. Financial regulation The US senator Elizabeth Warren has been concerned the deal will undermine the regulation of banks, financial institutions and Wall Street. The US reportedly wants to restrict the \u201cfinancial tools\u201d available to foreign governments to tackle potential financial crises. 7. Labour rights Australia and the US have accepted the text on \u201cdispute settlement on labour rights\u201d \u2013 details as yet unknown \u2013 which every other country has rejected apart from Japan, which has reserved, and New Zealand, which has no position in the November 6 documents. 8. Tobacco control The unknown text on \u201ctobacco exception\u201d has been accepted by only the US and Malaysia. Australia, which has been a leader in tobacco control with plain-packaging laws and graphic warnings, has reserved its position. 9. Agriculture All countries have committed to remove agricultural export subsidies, except for the US."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/delhi-rape-one-year-anything-changed-india-women", "sentences": ["The woman died from her injuries 13\u00a0days later while undergoing em8ergency treatment in Singapore, in a case that sparked national and international protest."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T10:09:00Z", "title": "Delhi rape: one year on, has anything changed for India's women?", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Women", "Rape and sexual assault", "Life and style", "Society", "Media", "Equality"], "article": "It took the police 14 days to register the rape allegation and a further 30 days to make an arrest, by which time the victim had killed herself.

A year on, it seems fair to ask what difference horrific cases such as\u00a0these have made to the treatment of\u00a0women in India. The elder sister of the girl from the small village in the Punjab who was raped in a field has said that after the teenager tried to report the incident, police officials first refused to register the case and then pressured her to make peace with the alleged rapists. &quot;On some occasions, the policemen would take her to the police station in late evening hours. They also tried to force her to withdraw her complaint.&quot; The attackers, under no legal restraint, threatened their victim and her family. On 26 December, the young woman swallowed poison just as protests were gaining momentum in Delhi. One news presenter said: &quot;Even as Delhi streets are bubbling over with protests, it took the suicide of a 17-year-old rape victim for the police to finally act on her complaint. What good is that now?&quot; Others are asking the same question. The Delhi bus case appears to have encouraged more women to come forward if they have been raped, and for the media to report these allegation, but in many other ways little appears to have changed. Soon after the Delhi rape, the Indian government surprised everyone by quickly setting up a commission to update the law before accepting most of its recommendations (except, crucially, to criminalise marital rape). But passing progressive legislation is very different to enforcing it, especially in a country where police corruption is widespread and legal bans on dowry payments and sex-selection are routinely flouted. The latest annual figures available show that of the 706 rape cases filed in New Delhi in 2012, only one, the most famous, ended in conviction. Police in Delhi recorded 501 allegations of harassment and 64 of rape between 16\u00a0December 2012 and 4 January 2013 and yet just four inquiries were launched. In the nine months to October this year, almost twice as many rape victims (1,330) have come forward, while four times as many allegations of molestation have been made. One area that has changed in the past year is the national media, which has maintained interest in stories of violence against women for the entire year. &quot;The media has raised awareness by default that India has a lot of gender problems. People are finally having conversations that were otherwise swept underneath the carpet. It is still not doing enough to educate the masses about violence against women, but the media conversation is finally moving in the right direction,&quot; says Krishna Khunti, a\u00a0charity worker who lives in Mumbai. Just last month, allegations of sexual assault at the respected investigative magazine Tehelka made front page news as its editor-in-chief Tarun Tejpal was arrested and questioned. Even its managing editor Shoma Chaudhury had to resign over accusations that she\u00a0played down the controversy. While heightened media attention can spur politicians and the police into action, activists say it has also had the effect of challenging the shaming of women who have been sexually assaulted. Some rape victims have even revealed their identities on television in a bid to raise awareness of\u00a0the increasing numbers of sexual assaults. The problems of sexual violence in India underlines the deep-rooted misogyny of a society where men are valued so much more highly than women. Back in 1991, the economist Amartya Sen estimated that Asia as a whole was &quot;missing&quot; around 100 million women. This discrepancy has only got worse in the intervening years. According to India&apos;s 2011 census, there are 37 million fewer women than men (586.5 versus 623.7 million). In countries where both sexes receive similar care, there are typically more women; the European Union has an average of 95 men for every 100 women, for example. To equal the more conservative sex ratio of 96 men for every 100 women, India would need around 23 million more women. In other words, there are roughly 60 million women &quot;missing&quot; from India&apos;s population \u2013 nearly equal to all of the people in the UK. This gender gap is due to a toxic combination of foeticide, infanticide, excessive neglect of girls, murder and destitution. In northern and western states, especially in urban middle-class areas, it is not unusual for foetuses to be aborted before birth, simply because families don&apos;t want girls. A\u00a0girl under the age of five has 75% more chance of dying through neglect than a boy \u2013 the highest differential in the world. But as the cost of a dowry is rising in India, making families more reluctant to have daughters, the sex-ratio for children under the age of six is consistently falling \u2013 from a high of 983\u00a0girls to 1,000 boys in 1951, to 914\u00a0girls in 2011. Sehjo Singh, director of programmes at ActionAid India, says: &quot;We have seen over the past decade that sex selection services, which were once limited to urban areas, are now moving into rural areas. These services, such as ultra sonography machines, are also getting cheaper which makes them more available to rural families. ActionAid is extremely worried about these developments and what it means for the huge numbers of girls who are killed in India before they are even born.&quot; As the gap between the number of men and women keeps widening, men in some northern areas are finding it harder to find wives. NGOs report &quot;a boom in sex trafficking&quot; as unmarried men turn to prostitution, kidnapping or even buying young girls as &quot;brides&quot;. Signs of progress are limited. This week&apos;s elections in Delhi saw politicians compete on safety policies for women for the first time. &quot;The very fact that parties are debating women and their rights is a victory for the women&apos;s safety movement. This has never happened before,&quot; Sudha Sundararaman, general secretary of the NGO AIDWA told the Wall Street Journal. But others pointed to how male-dominated party candidate lists were evidence of mere posturing. A survey in the DNA newspaper last week found that only 15% of women in the commercial capital Mumbai felt safe while travelling on public transport. After the death of the 17-year-old rape victim, Punjab police belatedly sacked two officers for misconduct and charged another for abetting her suicide. The state judge said the judicial system was becoming so ineffectual and slow that violence against women was rising because criminals felt they would go unpunished. The victim&apos;s family told local television that the teenager&apos;s final words were: &quot;There is nobody willing to listen to us, mother.&quot; Even a year after these horrific incidents, too many\u00a0Indian women still feel that way."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/dec/10/inside-guardian-weekly-abby-deveney", "sentences": ["We look at troop buildup in the Central African Republic, a purge of staggering proportions in Pyongyang, some rather gentle words from Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and riots jolting Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T16:18:48Z", "title": "Inside the 13 December edition", "tags": [], "article": "Most journalists were ready for it months ago.

In Ukraine, authorities sent in riot police against protesters upset by President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s decision not to sign an integration pact with the EU. In Thailand, authorities stepped back from a violent clash with protesters of their own, instead dissolving parliament and calling a general election to defuse the latest spasm gripping the Bangkok body politic.

It is a striking figure, one of three new &quot;growth and cash&quot; objectives unveiled on Tuesday. To the sceptics who say such medium-term ambitions should be taken with a pinch of salt, especially when they rely on continued strong growth in already-strong Asia, the Pru could make two counter-arguments. First, that the last set of comparable targets, which covered 2011-13, have been met, or are being met. The group has achieved five and the sixth should be secured this financial year. What&apos;s more, none looked to be a breeze back in December 2010, when its chief executive, Tidjane Thiam, was obliged to woo shareholders with a decent self-improvement story after they gave a thumbs-down to his \u00a324bn pursuit of the AIA group. The share price has almost doubled since then. Second, the Pru, as ever, is making the case that investors should study the fundamentals of the high-growth Asian markets. Thiam&apos;s now-familiar charts on the growth of the middle-class in Asia tell the tale: this body of people numbered 525 million in 2009 and the projections are for 1.74 billion by 2020 and 3.23 billion by 2030. Their governments, by outsourcing large chunks of health and pension provision to the private sector, in effect demand that their citizens buy the financial products that the Pru and others sell. Thus the savings ratio in Singapore is 46%, in Indonesia it is 33% and in Thailand 30%. By contrast, the ratios in the UK and US are 7% and 6% respectively. In the insurance game, chasing growth requires capital, of course. But the \u00a310bn figure is for &quot;cumulative group underlying free surplus generation&quot;. The Pru is saying it is now well past the point where its Asian operations are a consumer of cash from the UK and the US. The division generated \u00a3484m of cash last year; the new plan aims for \u00a3900m-\u00a31.1bn in 2017. That&apos;s the bull case. The more bearish view would note that even emerging-markets bank Standard Chartered, after a decade of rising revenues and profits, has hit a bump in the form of a setback in South Korea and weakness in its financial market business. If you&apos;re an optimist, though, insurance in Asia is a more promising prospect than banking. That&apos;s a reasonable view. The Pru, a decade after cutting its dividend for the only time since 1914, now looks to be a formidable cash\u00a0machine."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/10/football-match-spot-fixing-allegations", "sentences": ["In the fallout from the prosecution of the Pakistani cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif \u2013 when the argot of illegal backstreet bookies in Mumbai and Singapore crashed into Southwark crown court via the Long Room \u2013 the fact that no bet was actually placed was often overlooked."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T20:26:00Z", "title": "Range of bets on offer for any sports event creates dangerous climate", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Hard on the heels of revelations that highlighted the vulnerability of non-league football to match-fixing a second wave of arrests has now suggested the related issue of spot-fixing ascends very much higher up the league pyramid. It is a problem of which there have been occasional glimpses, enough to provide an uneasy sense that spot-fixing may be more prevalent in the dressing room than had been thought. Matt Le Tissier&apos;s claim in his 2009 autobiography that he took part in a failed betting coup in 2005 when he attempted to kick the ball out early for a throw-in was treated almost as a light-hearted jape at the time. It did not look so amusing three years later when another former Southampton player, the Norwegian Claus Lundekvam, claimed there was a spell when the team would do it &quot;almost every week&quot; and &quot;made a fair bit of money&quot;. Lundekvam said at the time that among the players they would often influence the first corner, first throw or first yellow card as a &quot;bit of fun&quot;, although his team-mates from the time denied the allegations and Le Tissier said his own experience was a one-off. Now the suggestion has reared its head again, in much more serious fashion. Yet the allegations against those arrested \u2013 including the Blackburn Rovers striker DJ Campbell, two Tranmere Rovers players, a former Portsmouth defender and an Oldham Athletic player \u2013 are more complex than they might appear. As Ed Hawkins, author of a gripping book on the scale of the problem in cricket (Bookie Gambler Fixer Spy), has pointed out, there is no way of wagering large sums of money on outcomes such as a yellow or red card on the legal betting markets in Britain. All are tracked by the major bookmakers and, increasingly, by monitoring firms on behalf of the biggest sports. Any substantial bet of more than, say, \u00a3200 would immediately arouse suspicion and could lead to the market being pulled. Nor is there any evidence that it is possible to place bets on yellow or red cards in the $500bn grey and illegal market in Asia and the Far East. Three things may come into play when a footballer accepts tens of thousands of pounds to get a yellow or red card. He may leap at an opportunity to earn some easy money and not be too concerned with the reasons why it is being offered; there may be an element of simple loose-lipped braggadocio; or a &quot;fixer&quot; may have been attempting to prove he could affect the actions of a player on the pitch in order to prove his influence. In the fallout from the prosecution of the Pakistani cricketers Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif \u2013 when the argot of illegal backstreet bookies in Mumbai and Singapore crashed into Southwark crown court via the Long Room \u2013 the fact that no bet was actually placed was often overlooked. Here, too, the nub of the matter was the fact that Butt&apos;s agent, Mazhar Majeed, was trying to prove to an undercover journalist (the same one involved in the DJ Campbell case) that he had the players under his control. The reason the case was so insidious, and sent such shockwaves around the world, was that it showed the casual ease with which players were prepared to disregard the sanctity of the game. As with a yellow card in football, those involved probably convinced themselves that a no-ball made no difference to the outcome of the match. But for those watching, the purity of the sporting contest is everything. In football, too, it is what these revelations represent \u2013 rather than any gains they may or may not have produced \u2013 that shocks so profoundly. The picture painted by the Sun investigation plays to much wider concerns about the culture surrounding footballers and the globalised, highly remunerated, transitory world in which they, their agents and their entourages operate. Regardless of the protestations of domestic bookmakers that any volume of unusual bets on an individual would be picked up and the market pulled, sports bodies remain alarmed that they have no control over what bets are offered. They are likely to use the current high-profile allegations as support for their argument that the broad range of bets on offer on every single game creates a dangerous template for the illegal market and creates temptation within the legal one. For all that they can offer education to young players to warn them of the dangers and monitor the legal markets, sports bodies will argue that they should have the power to limit the range of bets offered on their sport \u2013 as well as some mechanism to reclaim a small percentage of the bookmakers&apos; profits to help fund the fight against corruption. It is an argument that the bookmakers, who believe they have proved the problem is almost exclusively driven by illegal rather than legal markets, will do all they can to rebuff. Nor does there yet seem to be enough of an understanding of the link between the gambling culture that thrives among Premier League players with huge salaries and the money flowing into the sport from bookmakers, and the integrity problems the game now faces. Sporting Chance, the charity which helps sports people with problems, has spoken of problem gambling as the great hidden epidemic within the game and it does not take a great leap of imagination to picture the pressure some of those players may face or the company they may keep. All those involved must hope that Westminster &quot;summit&quot;, which inevitably recalled a similar event after football&apos;s spate of high-profile incidents of racism that ended with many fine words but not too much appetite to tackle the underlying issues, is more than a mere publicity exercise."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/dec/11/ugandas-win-netball-nations-cup", "sentences": ["The facts of Uganda\u2019s national netball team go something like this: prior to this month the side hasn\u2019t played outside of Africa since 1979, the side is currently unranked, the team only secured government funding at the last minute to make the Singapore six-nation tournament after making a plea for public help via their national newspaper.", "Uganda then crushed ladder-leaders Singapore and thrashed a hapless Sri Lanka side to make the grand final against the odds, just edging out Papua New Guinea on percentage.", "Uganda dominated the grand final beating Singapore 52-29 in front of 2,000 home fans, the win gives them a netball world ranking for the first time in its history.", "Singapore has a new lease on life under Ruth Aitken Meanwhile Singapore looks set to become competitive once under their new coach, Ruth Aitken.", "Her calm, positive and tactical approach has already reaped rewards for Singapore who scored four wins in a row \u2013 including against the higher ranked USA, Papua New Guinea and Cook Islands teams as well as a drubbing of their traditional rivals the Sri Lanka.", "Aitken took the reins in Singapore four months ago.", "Based on Nations Cup (which won last year by Tanzania, who went through the competition undefeated) \u2013 it would seem that Uganda and Tanzania will take the African spots, with Malaysia and Singapore most likely edging out Sri Lanka and Hong Kong in the Asian event."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T21:56:32Z", "title": "Uganda\u2019s inspirational, remarkable Netball Nations Cup win", "tags": ["Netball", "Uganda", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "In Uganda, netball makes headlines \u2013 though the majority of club players play on makeshift dirt courts in villages and grass fields. The facts of Uganda\u2019s national netball team go something like this: prior to this month the side hasn\u2019t played outside of Africa since 1979, the side is currently unranked, the team only secured government funding at the last minute to make the Singapore six-nation tournament after making a plea for public help via their national newspaper. The trouble didn\u2019t end there though; the Uganda side missed their flights, meaning they had to forfeit their opening match. They arrived on day two of the competition \u2013 arriving just six hours before their first match, and beat Ireland 54-41 after a 10-hour flight. Uganda then faced Papua New Guinea. Apparently still suffering from jet lag, the She Cranes were trailing by 14 goals at half-time \u2013 a finals berth looked way out of sight. They then managed a spectacular turn-around led by towering captain Proscovia Peace and crafty wing attack Nakachwa Halima to draw the match 52-52 to stay in grand final contention. Uganda then crushed ladder-leaders Singapore and thrashed a hapless Sri Lanka side to make the grand final against the odds, just edging out Papua New Guinea on percentage. Uganda dominated the grand final beating Singapore 52-29 in front of 2,000 home fans, the win gives them a netball world ranking for the first time in its history. Not a bad effort really. After Uganda won the tournament I received an email from Uganda netball administrator Mpoza Dennis who said \u201cI told you we had some real talent in this country.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to argue with that. Singapore has a new lease on life under Ruth Aitken Meanwhile Singapore looks set to become competitive once under their new coach, Ruth Aitken. Aitken coached New Zealand to two Commonwealth Games medals and a World Cup win between 2002 and 2011. Her calm, positive and tactical approach has already reaped rewards for Singapore who scored four wins in a row \u2013 including against the higher ranked USA, Papua New Guinea and Cook Islands teams as well as a drubbing of their traditional rivals the Sri Lanka. Aitken took the reins in Singapore four months ago. What the Nations Cup means for the Netball World Cup 2015 Directly nothing; however, this tournament offered an insight into which teams we may see qualify for the 2015 event. The top six nations in the world get direct entry \u2013 this will almost certainly be Australia, New Zealand, England, Jamaica, South Africa and Malawi. The netball world is divided into five zones and a regional qualifying tournament will be held in each, with the top two qualifying for the prestigious event. Based on Nations Cup (which won last year by Tanzania, who went through the competition undefeated) \u2013 it would seem that Uganda and Tanzania will take the African spots, with Malaysia and Singapore most likely edging out Sri Lanka and Hong Kong in the Asian event. The Pacific region continues to be dominated by the Fiji Pearls, with Papua New Guinea now emerging as a slight frontrunner to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 2003 ahead of the Cook Islands and Samoa. Netball World Cup tries unconventional draw format  The big imbalance in world netball between the top six and the rest has made for some less than inspiring World Cup match-ups in the past. Even the quarter-finals have usually resulted in shockingly one-sided scorelines that have been nothing but an embarrassment for international netball. Tournament organisers have decided to start the tournament with 1 v 2, 3 v 4, 5 v 6, 7 v 8 \u2013 in separate pools. \u00a0This means the 2015 tournament will probably open with Australia v New Zealand and follow with Jamaica against England on day two on so on. This is certainly a massive improvement on last time, when we missed out on Australia v England and New Zealand v Jamaica.\u00a0 The top two from each pool will all progress to section one, with the bottom two from each pool going into section two. This new format ensures we will see good matches every day, the top four sides will play each other at least once and we will most likely get to see Silver Ferns against the Diamonds twice. This is certainly a significant improvement \u2013 though I would also suggest that teams nine-12 should be seeded \u2013 with the ninth- and 10th-ranked teams grouped in with the seventh- and eighth-ranked sides to ensure the best middle-weight teams have the greatest chance of making it through to section one.

Andrew Dettre and Soccer World", "tags": ["Australia", "A-League", "Australia sport", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "I am a little early to my meeting with Andrew Dettre at a retirement village in Sydney\u2019s leafy northern suburb of Killara. Should I be this nervous about meeting an 87-year-old? For two decades from 1962, Dettre wrote, edited, and often funded the now-defunct Soccer World newspaper. He is a giant of Australian football journalism. As part of my research project into the history of Australian football, in 2012 I spent several months painstakingly leafing through old, bound copies of Soccer World in the New South Wales State Library, as well as trawling microfilms of daily newspapers and magazines. Dettre\u2019s colourful editorials, which commented on everything from football\u2019s multicultural paradox to the future of the game in Australia, became a crucial part of the thesis. I had stalked the man\u2019s work for months, however meeting him came with its own hurdles. After procuring Dettre\u2019s telephone number from his son, Steve, we had arranged to meet in May. That was suddenly cancelled after Andrew sent me a brusque email, commenting that a profile of his time atSoccer Worldwould need an entire biography. \u201cThis, I am sure, is not your aim\u201d he wrote, in typically elegant but direct fashion. It was a crushing disappointment for me, and so when I received another email from him in June, enquiring if I was still interested in the project, I jumped at the opportunity. But by this point I was more hesitant in my approach. It was clear that this was a proud man, wary of young snoopers like myself. By September, we had finalised a date, on the condition that his son would also be present. Instructed by Andrew to sit opposite him and Steve in the living room, a glass-topped coffee table separates me from my subject. As Andrew gazes intently at me and Steve fiddles with his phone, I nervously start the voice-recorder. On the wall, a bookshelf is stuffed with literature on European history and football. At the top of the pile I notice a biography of Karl Marx. Later, Andrew would open the cupboard beside the bookshelf to reveal stacks of old, bound copies of Soccer World. The paper, Andrew informs me, was started by Hungarians in 1958, with the help of a few Scotsmen. \u201cIt was published on a green newsprint, which was imported from Finland,\u201d explains Andrew. \u201cMainly because that was the colour of the most famous Hungarian club, Ferencvaros, but also because that was the colour of the daily newspaper in Hungary in the pre-communist era.\u201d A proud Magyar, Andrew left Hungary in 1948 after the Communist authorities shut down the social democratic newspaper Szegedi Nepszava, where Andrew worked as a junior reporter. He soon became involved in \u2018the green paper\u2019 in Australia after the famous 1957 New South Wales split, which pitted new European migrant clubs in Sydney against the ruling Anglo establishment. As Andrew remembers, \u201cThis was actually the result of the 1957 soccer revolution in this country. The NSW Soccer Association, which was an archaic body, were very unhappy with Hakoah, Prague, APIA Leichhardt and the other big migrant clubs. No matter how many times they [the migrant clubs] won the second division, they were never promoted. It led to a breakaway, and that breakaway spawned the paper.\u201d Founded by Marcell Nagy, a former president of the Hungarian FA, Soccer Worldwas explicitly set up to serve its core constituents. \u201cIt was realised by football-loving migrants\u201d, explains Andrew, \u201cthat no matter how hard they tried, they will not be able to compete for space with rugby league and rugby union. They needed an outlet \u2026 this was the first in the country.\u201d Andrew began writing for Soccer World in 1962. His day job was in the features and supplements section in Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph, which forced him to take the pseudonym \u2018Paul Dean\u2019. Dean was a combination of, \u2018DE\u2019 for Dettre, \u2018AN\u2019 for Andrew. \u201cI had a contract which stipulated that I wouldn\u2019t write for other magazines. I don\u2019t think they would have sued me, because they were too big for that, but I had to be cautious, so I just invented this name.\u201d In 1972, the Daily Telegraph was bought by Rupert Murdoch from Sir Frank Packer. After 18 years at the Telegraph, Andrew Dettre once again became a refugee. Forced to work under conditions that he now describes as \u201cstrange and difficult\u201d, when Andrew was offered a job as press secretary for a minister in the incoming Labor government, he seized the opportunity. Not wanting to lose contact with Soccer World, Andrew came up with a new pseudonym \u2018Mike Renwick\u2019 in order to continue writing. Close observers might have noticed that \u2018Renwick\u2019 was also the name of the street where the paper was printed in Marrickville. From the outset, Soccer World\u2019sattention to detail distinguished itas a publication of record, not just comment and match reports. It was a feature that continued under Andrew&apos;s editorship. \u201cSteve introduced a very good column called \u2018Club Patrol\u2019, which was just little items. If a player arrived or left or broke his leg or got married or divorced or whatever, that was an item. We had a whole page for that. \u201cThen we had a whole page for international news. The [Sydney Morning] Herald occasionally carried the English league, but they would never bother with the Italian league, or the Spanish league. We bothered. We were a universal paper, with a universal interest in soccer. Mainly because we really believed that this was the only way that soccer could survive in this country, where it was suppressed, really suppressed, by the establishment, in favour of the rugby codes.\u201d Soccer World was famously unafraid of commenting on unpopular causes or the difficulties faced by the local game, with Andrew often leading the charge. One of the central questions facing Australian football from the post-war period to the early part of the 21st century was the role that migrants and migrant clubs should play in the game. Should a club run by Greek migrants in South Melbourne keep \u2018Hellas\u2019 at the end of their name? Should they carry the Greek cross on their shirt logo? Should match programs and announcements be in Greek or English, or both? Should migrant clubs even exist at all? This was a question repeated for almost every ethnic group in Australian life, from the Italians at Azzuri in Brisbane, the Poles at Polonia in Adelaide to the South Americans at Penrith Uruguay in western Sydney. In April 1978, in his regular editorial column called \u2018Smalltalk\u2019, Andrew Dettre summed up football\u2019s multicultural dilemma. \u201cMigrants are perfectly entitled to form whatever association or union they want, be that a church choir, welfare agency, scout group or soccer team. The trouble lies elsewhere; Australians [born here] are also entitled to ignore these. And they do.\u201d One year later, after a fresh wave of de-ethnicisation initiatives from the Australian Soccer Federation (ASF), Dettre grew more frustrated. He wrote a hypothetical story of a grandfather telling his grandson, \u201cHakkabi [Hakoah] became Meatpie United, and Plague [Prague] was renamed Vegemite Wanderers\u2026. all the players, coaches, referees, federation officials and even some of the soccer writers had to change their names to make the game more marketable. Of course, there was nothing racist about it, just ordinary business sense.\u201d Thirty five years on, Andrew maintains his position, explaining that many clubs from around the world have maintained their foreign symbolism from another era, whether it be Corinthians in Brazil or Milan in Italy. \u201cThe names were the glue. Hakoah was a Jewish club, and they said \u2018why hide it?\u2019 The Jews suffered enough during World War Two, we don\u2019t have to be ashamed. It was the same at St George Budapest, which was called Budapest at the time. They were all Hungarians, all 11, because there were so many of them! \u201cThey came from good clubs in Hungary, became refugees in Germany, they were accepted as migrants to Australia, and when they got here they wanted to play football. But they didn\u2019t want them. I remember lots of little scandals at Bankstown, Granville, Macarthur Park and so on. They said \u2018come back some other time.\u2019 They didn\u2019t want them in case they disrupted the Anglo-Saxon unity. It was a deep prejudice.\u201d In the Christmas of 1979, the Dettre family traveled to the United States, where Andrew quickly became taken with the booming North American Soccer League. In February 1980, he penned what might be one of the most prophetic editorials in Australian football history. He recommended seven points, five of which included a new one-team, one-city policy, corporate support for clubs, full-time professionalism for players and staff, television packages to be sold on a national basis, and of course, summer soccer. Almost a quarter of a century later, in 2005, the fully-professional A-League kicked off with eight teams representing eight cities. Backed by some of the country\u2019s biggest corporate heavyweights and televised live on Fox Sports, the season started in November, when the Australian autumn gives way to summer. However, in 1980, this was revolutionary stuff, particularly Dettre\u2019s suggestion of \u2018summer soccer\u2019. \u201cIt dawned on me that they [the Americans] had escaped the overbearing presence of gridiron by playing in the off-season. I wrote a couple of pieces, and there was a huge uproar. I said, \u2018the only way we can escape the clutches of rugby league and Australian Rules is by playing in the reverse season.\u2019\u201d \u201cThe funny thing is,\u201d Steve interrupts, \u201cI\u2019ll come up for a coffee with Dad, and he\u2019ll say, \u2018you won\u2019t believe what one of these guys has written\u2019, and they\u2019ll be talking about things we were recommending in the 70s! \u201cWhen Dad was promoting summer soccer, I was at AAP,\u201d Steve continues. \u201cI still remember the tension in the press boxes when we\u2019d turn up. It wasn\u2019t just the concept of summer soccer, a lot of these guys had a very cosy existence. They covered football in the winter, and then they covered cricket or horse-racing or something else in the summer, and if the football season went into the summer\u2026\u201d Andrew quickly finishes his sentence, \u201cit didn\u2019t suit them.\u201d Like much of Australia\u2019s football history, these are stories that are effectively lost to the game. They are whitewashed by glitzy advertisements and the narrow Australian obsession with the future. Andrew Dettre\u2019s brainwave in the Rockefeller Centre in midtown Manhattan in 1979 is not part of the official history of the A-League, but perhaps it should be. \u201cNo-one ever acknowledged the fact that I promoted this concept. But it doesn\u2019t matter to me, what matters is that it works.\u201d Andrew is more comfortable now. \u201cTea or coffee?\u201d he asks me. I have tea. Steve and Andrew drink coffee, served on a platter crowded with biscuits, napkins and a sugar bowl. I think I have earnt Andrew\u2019s trust. \u201cI believed in what I wrote,\u201d my host reiterates. \u201cI never wrote anything, ever, in my life, that I didn\u2019t believe. No, really\u2026 whether I was writing in Hungarian, or English, or on football or travel or news. I think I was a natural writer.\u201d His son nods in agreement. \u201cMy spelling was always shocking\u201d Steve groans. \u201cAs opposed to Dad\u2019s, which was always flawless. Every time I would submit a story with a spelling mistake, there\u2019d be a big red circle around it. One day, I kept on misspelling \u2018surprise\u2019, and he sent it back to me and said \u2018I want you to write it out a hundred times.\u2019 He was sick of constantly correcting it.\u201d The entire Dettre family was roped into Soccer World. In 1976, when his good friend, the late Lucien Gautier, suddenly went missing, Andrew was thrust into running the paper on his own. \u201cI had to carry the job of mine, for the whole year, while at night doing Soccer World with Steven. At the end of the year, we had to decide what to do. Nobody wanted to do it full time, so I had to close it down, or carry on. We had to take a second mortgage on the house.\u201d The Dettre household became an office as the entire family devoted themselves to the newspaper. A compugraphic typesetter was set up in Andrew\u2019s study. \u201cWhatever we could, we set in before the weekend. On Friday and Saturday Steve would do his \u2018Club Patrol\u2019. Then the weekend came the rush, and on Monday morning, I drove to the Post Office and found the envelopes with the scores from Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane ... match reports, ratings, who went off in what minute, everything. It was almost a religious experience to be complete and to be absolutely full.\u201d Andrew says he is indebted to his reporters from around the country, including Keith Gilmour, Charles Spiteri, Alan Crisp, Val Hokin, Alan Fouche, Jim Cook and Vic Migliaccio. All of his reporters received payment. \u201cNot much, but we didn\u2019t ask anyone to do it for a favour. \u201cI loved the paper,\u201d Andrew continues. \u201cWe all loved the paper. I just didn\u2019t have the heart to walk away from it. My wife, who had nothing to do with the paper all those years before, she was roped in.\u201d \u201cThe bookkeeper!\u201d Steve laughs uproariously. \u201cNo, not just the bookkeeper,\u201d levels Andrew. \u201cWhen the paper was printed on Tuesday, she was putting them all in envelopes, because we were proud of the fact that we did not send the papers out in bulk mail, but as private mail. She was always up until about two o\u2019clock in the morning, while I was asleep. This was unbelievable, sometimes I wake up and think \u2018it didn\u2019t happen. This is just my fantasy.\u2019\u201d \u201cThis partially explains why I failed my optometry degree\u201d laughs Steve. He now works with Infostrada Sports, a leading Dutch-based sports data, newswire and consultancy service. His apprenticeship producing Soccer World from his father\u2019s study has no doubt served him well. On cue, Andrew\u2019s wife, Colleen return from her swimming session. \u201cA challenge to Dawn Fraser\u201d Andrew winks at me. \u201cSolved all the problems in the world?\u201d asks Colleen with a smile. \u201cUnsolvable\u201d retorts her husband. She takes a seat to my left and listens intently. There remains one question I want to ask. Les Murray, the godfather of Australian football broadcasting, had recently written an editorial describing the influence of Soccer World on his career. He wrote, \u201cit was my bible and only source of information and nourishment in my insatiable hunger to absorb what I could about football. I counted the days and the minutes to each Thursday when it hit the streets\u2026 I owe Lucien Gautier and Andrew Dettre (who, now in his 80s, is very much with us) an awful lot. My so-called knowledge of football, which was the platform for my career at SBS, would not be without what I learned from the Green Paper.\u201d The day before, I was instructed by Ray Gatt, a senior football journalist for the Australian newspaper, to send my regards to Andrew. \u201cHe\u2019s a fine writer, and a very intelligent man\u201d Gatt had informed me, \u201cgive him my best.\u201d \u201cDo you feel a sense of\u2026\u201d I begin, before Andrew cuts me off. \u201cHuge\u201d he interrupts, before pausing for effect. Colleen giggles beside me. \u201cI feel very proud, and very happy that I did it.\u201d \u201cI was going to ask whether you feel a sense of pride at the number of journalists who were influenced by you?\u201d I ask. \u201cI like them\u201d, Andrew says simply, \u201cand I\u2019m glad they liked me, because we were obsessed, really. Without any obsession, this newspaper would have died.\u201d     Andrew Dettre (front row, far left) at Wentworth Park in Glebe, in 1968, with fellow journalists. Photograph courtesy of Andrew Dettre    We talk more about the enormous effort the Dettre family and others put into producing Soccer World, before Andrew starts again on another of his concepts. \u201cAsia. Asia is our territory, it was obvious to everyone. In 1972, [Sir] Arthur George asked me and Tibor Kalman, an official of Hakoah, to go to Asia to try to get support for a vote to be admitted to the Asian Confederation. So we went along. Tibor Kalman was a well-to-do man, he offered to pay the expenses. He was my friend and my host. \u201cWe went to Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Thailand, everywhere. It was three weeks or something, on behalf of the Australian Soccer Federation. When I came back, I wrote a report, saying every effort should be made to become part of Asia, because they will not come to you begging you to join, but with the right approach, they will let you in.\u201d As with much of Dettre\u2019s visions, the dream took a long time to be fulfilled. The ASF received zero votes at the AFC Congress in 1973, and remained locked in Oceania. On the first day of 2006, over three decades after Dettre and Kalman\u2019s trip, Australia was finally accepted into the Asian Football Confederation. I ask Andrew whether he feels that the game has finally made it. Many of his concepts and ideas, while unappreciated, have since come to fruition. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d he responds, drawing out the last two words slowly. \u201cDeep down in my heart, I always feel, it doesn\u2019t matter whether we are number one. We should love the game of soccer because we feel that it\u2019s a superior sport. But we should try to live within our means.&quot; Steve gets up to leave. His 16-year-old son, Louis, is about to commence exams. Steve kisses his mother goodbye, and gives his father a quick hug. Andrew fetches a book from the shelf and hands it to me \u201cas a souvenir\u201d. The book is How to Play Winning Soccer, published in 1978 and written by my host. Inside is scrawled \u201cto Joe Gorman. With best wishes. Andrew Dettre, 2013\u2019\u201d Touched by his generosity, I ask whether he has any plans to write again. Andrew gazes out of the window, and his wife chimes in \u201cyou become a feather duster when you\u2019re old. I think he\u2019s written out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not only that,\u201d replies Andrew, turning his attention back to the conversation. \u201cI\u2019m not a part of soccer anymore. Technology has bypassed me, events bypassed me. I\u2019m not complaining, I\u2019m just saying, this is the normal thing when you get old. I don\u2019t believe that I am 87, but I am. I only feel 86-and-a-half.\u201d Soccer World ceased publication in 1982. Andrew\u2019s valedictory column finished with this poignant line: \u201cSoccer, as I said, will survive. But for me it will not be the same.\u201d As his wife leaves for the hairdresser, I ask Andrew whether he still feels the same way. \u201cI do,\u201d he says. \u201cI really do. When you get old, you are resentful of youth... you are aware of your mortality, which at the age of 22 you\u2019re not. At the age of 22 I skipped away from Hungary, never to return to see my parents again, for political reasons \u2026 [because of] the communists. \u201cI didn\u2019t think what would happen to me at 30 or 50 or 80 or 87. It\u2019s not resentment but a sad admission of defeat that your best days are over, you\u2019re not going to repeat the huge adventures that you had in publishing and in newspapers and book writing. \u201cAt the same time, honestly, I feel very proud.\u201d By now, Andrew is choking up, but he continues. \u201cI feel very proud to have done what I\u2019ve done. I didn\u2019t get rich, I didn\u2019t get famous, but I enjoyed myself. I chose well. I wouldn\u2019t do anything any different if I had a second go. I love journalism, I love writing, I\u2019m in love with the English language. \u201cI learnt it like a maniac five hours a day during the last years of the war, when I had nothing to do except be scared of bombing. Anyway, this to me means a hell of a lot, that I can speak to you in your mother tongue. I\u2019ve been interested in languages, journalism and writing. To me there is nothing else in life. This is it. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be a bank manager, I didn\u2019t want to be a politician, I didn\u2019t want to be a merchant or entrepreneur or chef. This is it. I am glad I was enabled to do what I did. And now at 87, I don\u2019t want to start again, I don\u2019t want to renew old contacts.&quot; With a grin, Andrew finishes. &quot;As they say in Hungary, \u2018a stuffed cabbage doesn\u2019t taste any good when you heat it up for the second time.&apos;\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/dec/12/robot-commuter-colombia", "sentences": ["Colombia has become so central to the global distribution network that stolen smartphones are arriving by air and sea from points as distant as Spain and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T07:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: offline Sheets, Japan's apps boom, robot writing, snooze = lose, and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Google adds offline editing to its spreadsheet offering &gt;&gt; TIME.com  One decision Google made about this new version is unexpected: It only affects new spreadsheets you create.

How stolen smartphones end up in the hands of Colombian cartels &gt;&gt; Huffington Post Gerry Smith:   The influx of traffickers to the stolen smartphone trade was confirmed by an active Colombian police informant who spoke to HuffPost on condition he not be named, citing threats to his life. He said cartels favor high-end devices like the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy. Many of the phones arriving here in bulk and destined for retail distribution are stolen in the United States, the informant said. &quot;When you turn on the phone,&quot; he said, &quot;it says AT&amp;T or T-Mobile.&quot; According to the informant, the traffickers take stolen phones from the United States to an electronics market at a shopping center in downtown Bogota, where the devices are refurbished and then smuggled across borders, mostly by ground. Colombia has become so central to the global distribution network that stolen smartphones are arriving by air and sea from points as distant as Spain and Singapore.

Born Estelle Loggin in Duncan, on Vancouver Island, Canada, she moved at the age of 10 with her parents to the UK. After attending Micklefield school in Seaford, East Sussex, she completed her English degree at Bedford College, University of London, just before the outbreak of the second world war. In 1940 she married Michael Friend Serpell, an assistant curator at the National Portrait Gallery, who went on to serve in British government security. My sister, Hilary, and I were born during the wartime evacuation of London. After the war, our family lived in the suburb of Barnes, commuting into London for work and school. A devoted home-maker and educator of her children, Estelle maintained a part-time professional career, offering evening lectures at the City Lit adult education college in Holborn on Know Your Classics, covering an international range of literature, and a diploma course in English literature. Michael&apos;s job meant travelling around the world, including stints in Singapore and Thailand, during which Estelle taught at the universities of Nanyang (1959-62) and Thammasat, Bangkok (1964-66) respectively. In 1966, they settled in the Norfolk village of Kenninghall, and Estelle continued to teach until the 1980s. Her approach to teaching aimed to cultivate aesthetic sensitivity and delight in the pursuit of knowledge. Education, she said, should be understood above all as &quot;a feast for the mind&quot;. She attributed her own love of literature to two of her teachers at Bedford College, FP Wilson and Louis MacNeice, and sought to inspire it in her students. Estelle&apos;s sense of social responsibility led her to undertake extensive voluntary work, as well as make donations to Oxfam. The same spirit informed her courageous advocacy on behalf of those facing bureaucratic oppression, and her decision to install solar-powered heating in her house. Her liberal political consciousness, initially somewhat restrained, eventually found expression in fundraising for the Social Democratic party. Estelle&apos;s life in many ways represented the maxim: &quot;Think globally, act locally.&quot; Above all, she was a loyal believer in personal relationships and was much loved and respected by family, friends, neighbours and students. Following Michael&apos;s death in 1983, Estelle remained a pillar of the community in Kenninghall for another 25 years. In 2009, her declining health led her to move to a nursing home in Hilary&apos;s Cornwall village of Coverack.

It may come as a surprise to their children. The survey also asked people who are not yet fully retired how much they expected to inherit and the median response was a much lower $131,801. But this amount was still higher than any other country surveyed. Graham Heunis, head of retail banking and wealth management for HSBC in Australia, says the unusually high amount suggested by Australian retirees is down to the nation\u2019s 22-years of economic prosperity. \u201cOver the past decade Australian household wealth has grown 7.6% per year, making us one of the richest nations per capita globally, allowing retirees to provide their children a significant financial legacy,\u201d he said. Not that it will necessarily have a huge effect. Only 36% of non-retirees who had received an inheritance told the survey that it made saving for their own retirement any easier and 14% said it actually made it more difficult. Globally, 25% of survey respondents said they received a significant financial loan or gift from their parents, with the highest rate of financial gift recipients in India with 53%. The report said 21% of fully retired Australian respondents had received a financial gift and 5% had been given a loan by their parents, both at a median value of US$26,590. \u201cSuch gifts or loans from family were given for a wide range of uses, including major life events such as getting married (25%), children\u2019s education fees (24%), major purchases (23%), or help with housing costs (22%),\u201d said the report. The survey also found 43% of Australian retirees\u2019 income is funded by state pensions and benefits. It was slightly above the 37% global average, but well behind the world leader France, where state benefits and pensions funded 83% of retirement income."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/dec/13/ashmolean-bequeathed-chinese-modern-contemporary-art", "sentences": ["After the war, Sullivan founded the art museum at the University of Malaya in Singapore and became professor of oriental art at Stanford University in California."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-13T19:30:00Z", "title": "Ashmolean given 'extraordinary gift' of Chinese modern art", "tags": ["Ashmolean Museum", "Museums", "Heritage", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "UK news"], "article": "More than 400 works that make up the finest private collection of Chinese modern art that exists in the west have been left to Britain&apos;s oldest museum, it has been announced. The Ashmolean in Oxford on Friday revealed details of what the museum&apos;s director, Christopher Brown, called &quot;an extraordinary gift&quot;. The donor was Professor Michael Sullivan, a long-time friend of the Ashmolean, who died in September. Not only was he the pre-eminent western authority on modern Chinese art, he had also built up an astonishing collection \u2013 often buying directly from the artists themselves \u2013 which filled the walls of his Oxford flat. Behind the bequest is a touching love story. Sullivan, a conscientious objector during the second world war, initially went to China in 1940 to drive lorries for the Red Cross. There he fell in love, first with the country, its history and its art, and then with Wu Baohuan, who became his wife in 1943 and thereafter became known as Khoan Sullivan. After the war, Sullivan founded the art museum at the University of Malaya in Singapore and became professor of oriental art at Stanford University in California. With his wife able to open doors, the Sullivans began making lasting friendships with significant Chinese artists. They gave him work and he began to become serious about buying it, building up a remarkable collection over 70 years. Khoan died a decade ago but Sullivan continued to collect until near the end of his life. Shelagh Vainker, the Ashmolean&apos;s curator of Chinese art, said that Sullivan was &quot;tremendously revered in China&quot; and that an exhibition in his honour was staged at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2012. This included works from his collection and also photographs of the Sullivans in China. Brown recalled receiving a box of books about 18 months ago that had been packed away from his childhood. He opened it to discover a long-forgotten paperback copy of a seminal book on Chinese art by Sullivan, first published in 1959. &quot;I must have asked for it as a school prize and evidently I had read it \u2013 in showing it to Michael I didn&apos;t have to rough it up in any way.&quot; The bequeathed works are still being valued but have been conservatively valued at more than \u00a315m. They include paintings by artists such as Qi Baishi, Zhang Daqian and Xu Bing. The Ashmolean already has the best collection of modern Chinese art of any museum in Europe, one that it began collecting in the 1950s. In addition to the bequest, the Ashmolean announced a 2014 exhibitions programme that will include shows of work by C\u00e9zanne and William Blake, and one on that most enduring of subjects, Tutankhamun. The summer show will be staged in what is the 75th anniversary year of Oxford&apos;s Griffith Institute, home of renowned Egyptological archives. It will shine a light on Howard Carter&apos;s discovery of the pharaoh&apos;s tomb in 1922, as well as exploring the mania for the subject in popular culture that followed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/14/qantas-tony-abbott", "sentences": ["The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has said the airline is not competing on a level playing field, with competitor Virgin receiving a $350m injection from its foreign owners Etihad, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-14T07:40:00Z", "title": "Qantas: Tony Abbott hints foreign takeover might be allowed", "tags": ["Qantas", "Tony Abbott", "Australian politics", "Australia news"], "article": "Tony Abbott has backed releasing Qantas from restrictions on foreign investment, saying it is not an unreasonable request for the Australian airline to be allowed more than 49% overseas ownership.

The prime minister had previously said &quot;the Australian economy would be a stunted impoverished thing without foreign investment&quot;, while ruling out the government subsidising the airline or acting as a guarantor for its debt. The Qantas Sale Act 1992, under which the airline was privatised, limits foreign ownership to just under half. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, has said the airline is not competing on a level playing field, with competitor Virgin receiving a $350m injection from its foreign owners Etihad, Air New Zealand and Singapore Airlines. Qantas has announced it plans to shed 1,000 jobs, impose pay freezes and make cuts across the board as it confronts the prospect of massive losses. Its credit rating was downgraded to junk status by Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s after it unveiled half-year losses of $300m and said it needed to cut $2bn from its costs over the next three years.  The independent senator Nick Xenophon has challenged Joyce to show one dollar of profit since setting up Jetstar Asia and other offshoots. &quot;If the CEO Alan Joyce and the chairman Lee Clifford go, that will transform the airline because they have presided over monumental strategic mistakes including the failed Jetstar experiment in Asia where they have burned hundreds of millions,&quot; he told AAP. &quot;The airline is now vulnerable to a private equity takeover because the share price is so low. The private equity buccaneers are now circling the airline.&quot; The Labor MP Matt Thistlethwaite backed the restrictions in the Qantas act. &quot;Given what happened to private equity in the global financial crisis you could probably fairly say if we didn&apos;t have the Qantas Sale Act \u2026 Qantas would not be here today,&quot; he told Sky News.

Some of the more self-aggrandising chefs would say it is. But they would, wouldn't they? \nMore pointy-headed types than me have also argued that sublime cooking has transformative qualities and can contain layers of meaning, so, yeah, art. But I'm not convinced: surely food's eventual fate precludes it from any aspirations to high culture? Not that it stops rabid foodies using it as shorthand for the old kunst. A recent piece in the New York Times stated, \"Nobody cares if you know about Mozart or Leonardo any more, but you had better be able to discuss the difference between ganache and couverture.\" (Mind you, the same article also said that food is unable to provoke anger or sorrow. The writer clearly hadn't visited Gregg's Table.) \nSo here's the latest gallery restaurant, at the new Serpentine Sackler in Kensington Gardens. It's&nbsp;light years from the traditional art world hospitality of cling-filmed carrot cake served in the vaults. Designed by Zaha Hadid, it's&nbsp;little short of extraordinary. The 200-year-old former gunpowder store looks as though someone has flung a giant, uncooked pizza base over a&nbsp;supersized Alvar Aalto wave vase. In daylight, sitting inside this cream-&nbsp;and sorbet-coloured curiosity, with its swooping columns that manage to be simultaneously phallic and yonic, makes you feel all Alice In Wonderland, as if strange creatures are rustling in the greenery outside. In the evening, with trancey DJs and&nbsp;mood lighting, it's like one of those wildly designed joints in Vegas or Singapore. It's very, very Not London. \nThe chef, too, is very Not London. Oliver Lange is Berlin-born and has worked with Nobu and at pop-up \"happenings\" here and abroad. His dishes are characterised by brow-wrinkling complexity. Take this simple-sounding number: robata lamb tartare, aubergine and cornbread. First conundrum: how can a tartare be also robata'ed? Raw and grilled? The two large meat patties look and taste uncooked, but have about them a whiff of smoke, as though they'd had a brief grapple with the robata behind the bike sheds. The tiniest petals of acidulated onion cradle emulsified blobs of this and that \u2013 mustard, pea (I think) or aubergine, glossy and tongue-coating with oil. There's modernist \"snow\" of maltodextrin, fragranced with chives. And cornbread, reduced to wafer-thin crisps. \nOr there's \"Ollysan's\" (cringe) sushi: bizarre items topped with fried quails' eggs and truffle, or tofu and basil, scattered with seeds and served with soy jelly. Or whipped butter topped with powdered black Hawaiian salt. Or bread made with black pudding. Pork belly \u2013 a huge serving \u2013 features a hectic homage to the carrot: orange glazed; purple scattered with bacon-y dust; processed into a mousse-like sauce. Puffed pork rinds provide contrast and crunch. Oh, and there's a slow-braised pig's cheek, too. It's vaguely exhausting. Cauliflower also gets the treatment: served with cod in paper-thin raw cross-sections, and roasted and caramelised, and violently pureed. There are nuts and seaweeds, too, in case you're tempted to nod off. Puddings, particularly one made with tonka bean-scented tapioca, mango sorbet and dragonfruit, are like some kind of in-joke. I'm not sure I get it. \nMy favourite art-food collision on the planet \u2013 The Wapping Project \u2013 is&nbsp;about to close (go while you still can). I'm not sure this, a five-year installation, will replace it in my affections. But it's worth a visit, to be wowed by Hadid's vision and looked after by charming Juan Calatayud and his sharply dressed team. The food sure made us react, and I've thought about it a lot since.

The documents also state that the British army is &quot;understandably nervous&quot; about the sale to a private company of the Defence Support Group (DSG), a team of 2,800 top-grade engineers who service military equipment including aircraft, armoured vehicles and tanks both at home and in theatres such as Afghanistan. Ministers announced plans to sell off the DSG in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review as part of plans to slash the MoD budget, raising hundreds of millions of pounds. A formal invitation to tender is due in a few days. But the documents, marked &quot;restricted \u2013 commercial&quot;, spell out fears in Washington and the British army about the potential loss of intellectual property if and when top-secret information about equipment is taken out of MoD control and handed to a private company. The UK and US have in recent years increasingly shared military and battlefield communications technology \u2013 including location systems, so as to prevent friendly-fire deaths. However, the Pentagon and some members of Congress have long been nervous about the implications of technology-sharing agreements, even with America&apos;s closest allies. In the past these were governed by tough export control licences, which led to long delays. The process was made easier by the US-UK Defence Trade Co-operation Treaty, signed with George W Bush in 2007, in the last days of the Tony Blair administration. Coming into force last year, and driven by the need to share counter-terrorism technology more quickly during US-UK military co-operation in Iraq, this deal allowed much quicker technology transfers without the need for an export licence. In exchange, the UK is required by treaty to ensure that US technology is both covered by the Official Secrets Act and physically secure. It is the risk to this agreement that is at the heart of the problem. Indeed, US opponents of the treaty at the time pointed to the case of a US defence contractor that illegally transferred classified night-vision technology to China, Singapore \u2013 and Britain. Tory and Labour MPs, as well as trade unions which fear job losses and closure of maintenance and repair bases, have already voiced opposition to the sale. But the documents show that worries extend to the heart of the US and British military authorities. Top-level talks have taken place between US and UK officials. The papers state that &quot;the sale of DSG gives rise to significant IP [intellectual property] issues&quot;. A page marked &quot;Risks&quot; that lists measures taken to mitigate them states: &quot;IPR issues are a potential showstopper if the department does not judge that a buyer would have sufficient rights to deliver the requirement. Risk if sale goes ahead on basis of incomplete information, post-sale IP owners could refuse access to the IP, meaning DSG services couldn&apos;t be delivered and unavailability of equipment.&quot; The same page suggests the US would veto the handing of highly sensitive technical information to a private company if it was worried that agreements did not conform with legal requirements under the International Trade in Arms regulations (Itar), designed to protect national security. The risk assessment states: &quot;US government will be unwilling to agree to the transfer of activity on Itar-related technology to be transferred from MoD to the private sector \u2026 if work to agree such transfer is unsuccessful.&quot; It is understood any contract given to a private company would involve around \u00a31.4bn of work over 10 years. The papers acknowledge concerns that a sale, if not handled well, might not save money and might lead to legal problems that could cause crucial equipment to be unavailable. They also cite concerns over job losses and the security of supply of equipmentto the military. &quot;Specific areas of concern are likely to include job security, site closures and guarantee of supply to the armed forces,&quot; it said. The DSG&apos;s air business will be excluded from the sale, the documents state, because &quot;the market has little appetite to acquire it&quot;. They say that even if no &quot;strategic decision&quot; had been made to sell DSG that &quot;there would be a compelling case for change&quot;. The DSG&apos;s &quot;throughput is set to reduce as operations in Afghanistan cease and the army retires some of its legacy platforms from service. If DSG is to remain viable, it must find new sources of work from MOD and other customers.&quot; An MoD source said the sale of DSG would benefit taxpayers when completed in late 2014. &quot;This will allow us to better concentrate resources on the frontline, rather than the behind-the-scenes supporting functions such as vehicle repairs and maintenance.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/dec/15/letters-computer-systems-fiascos", "sentences": ["Go to countries such as Singapore, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland to see if their software can be cheaply modified for UK purposes."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-15T00:07:14Z", "title": "IT fiascos and how to avoid them | letters", "tags": ["Technology", "Technology sector", "UK news"], "article": "  As an ex-IT professional who has worked on big high-pressure projects, (all successful) I read Nick Cohen&apos;s article on the latest IT fiasco by private sector contractors with dismay (&quot;Just what will it take for Duncan Smith to lose his job?&quot;, Comment).

Stan Labovitch Windsor Proud of our Co-op links   We are proud to be MPs with explicit links to the centuries-old co-operative movement. The high-profile difficulties experienced by the Co-op bank have shocked us all and need to be fully investigated. But meaningful partnerships are strengthened, not broken, in times of adversity. Recent Conservative attacks on the co-operative movement and its ties to the Labour party are opportunistic, showing the shallowness of the lip service David Cameron once paid to mutualism. When the Rochdale Pioneers opened their first co-op shop in the north-west of England they wanted to ensure consumers got what they paid for \u2013 safe, unadulterated food sold using fair weights and measures. This ambition to protect the public interest lives on today in the national co-op movement. Led by its members, the sector is worth \u00a337bn, made up of over 6,000 individual co-operatives. Mutualism brings an understanding not just of how people work together but why and in whose interest. The Co-operative party has always remained resolutely independent, working with the Labour party to promote the values we share. Now, from co-operative housing to payday lending, the distinctive voice Co-operative MPs bring to parliament and the parliamentary Labour party shines through.

No longer the preserve of accountants, it won the attention of governments, parliaments, journalists, campaigners and voters who, according to one recent British poll, are more concerned about tax avoidance than any other aspect of companies&apos; behaviour. With so much focus on how rich people and companies dodge their fair share \u2013 and with many societies struggling with austerity \u2013 it&apos;s hardly surprising the international apparatus of tax evasion and avoidance is starting to look threatened. This year has seen so many breakthroughs that one risk, for those who believe tax justice will change the world, may be complacency. We are still only at the start of a much longer battle about the distribution of power within societies and between countries. We cannot expect the companies and individuals who have gained trillions through cheating the rest of us to let go without a fight. But with that warning about the need to keep pushing against tax dodging and the financial secrecy that sustains it, here are the four highlights of progress towards tax justice in 2013. First, after countless expos\u00e9s of multinationals such as Starbucks and Google, which pay little tax in countries where they do brisk business, G8 and G20 governments agreed to investigate how to tackle such obvious unfairness. The rich countries&apos; club, the OECD, is leading the work, which is supposed to create rules that benefit poor as well as wealthy nations \u2013 although the former will have to fight for it. Since poor countries lose about $160bn a year to tax dodging by multinationals, the likes of Christian Aid, ActionAid, Oxfam, Tax Justice Network and the Global Alliance for Tax Justice are campaigning for developing countries to have a voice, and for OECD member states to take that voice seriously. A second highlight was the G8 and G20 also agreeing that multinational companies must reveal more about their finances, by reporting them on a country-by-country basis. This will help tax authorities identify which firms should be further investigated. Campaigners now have to push for some governments \u2013 including the UK&apos;s \u2013 to accept that these reports should be public, so that everyone with an interest can know more about the companies&apos; tax practices in every country where they operate. A European Union decision this year requiring banks to report on a country-by-country basis should inspire future progress: the same rules should be extended as soon as possible to all industries. A third highlight has been that some governments acknowledged the dangers of allowing people to hide their identity and money behind shell companies, so distancing themselves from crimes such as tax evasion and corruption. In October, plans were announced for a public UK register of the real owners of 3m British companies. The next step is to ensure that others, including UK tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands, do the same. We also need to know who and what lies behind trusts and foundations. So far, most governments seem reluctant to tackle the menace of secret ownership. Finally, there has been progress towards greater sharing of tax information between countries. A growing number of tax havens \u2013 including Singapore, Luxembourg, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands \u2013 have agreed to start sharing information about who has money in their banks, by signing the existing international convention, although some UK tax havens have done so with a forest of reservations. This should help governments, including those of poor countries, to catch up with people who hide dirty money &quot;offshore&quot;. Building on this, the G8 and G20 countries have finally agreed to work towards automatic information sharing between countries. The &quot;automatic&quot; part means governments can obtain information much more easily than at present. Again, the task now is to ensure that the new system works for all countries from the outset, not just for the rich. This is an impressive list of advances, which few would have dared forecast even a year ago. It holds great promise for people living in poverty across the world. But what happened in 2013 is just the end of the beginning. In 2014 and for many years beyond, tax and transparency campaigners will need to keep the pressure on governments, simply to ensure that they do what they have already agreed to \u2013 in the face of well-funded, sustained opposition. There are also other problems, such as the tax incentives through which governments give away billions to companies every year, in the hope of attracting foreign investment. Governments need to realise that the unsustainable paradigm of tax competition has created a race to the bottom, in which most of us are losers and all the benefits accrue to multinationals. I am hopeful about tax justice in 2014. Campaigners are increasingly working together. For example, this year saw the formation of the Global Alliance for Tax Justice, an alliance of tax justice campaigners from different countries and regions.

The points were ridiculous and easily shrugged off. But silly statements about school life from the government are harder to ignore. In a recent speech, Liz Truss, schools minister, seethed about the fact that England&apos;s relatively low use of textbooks compared with other countries is in part due to progressivist &quot;child-centred learning&quot;, a practice that led, at her school, to &quot;anti-colouring books&quot; \u2013 without any blocks in which to colour. (Does this sound like &quot;paper&quot; to anyone else?) Likewise, the education secretary, Michael Gove, gave a speech entitled The Progressive Betrayal in which he argued that such ideas had addled a generation; that restoring rigour was a priority, in particular, more memorisation of facts and &quot;disciplined&quot; learning \u2013 which seems to mean being silent and facing the front. If it were true that &quot;progressive&quot; thinking had taken over, it would be problematic. But how many Sats or GCSE or A-level teachers will tell you their class aren&apos;t memorising anything? And is it not possible that the reason why students might be asked to talk, or work in a group, or complete a task that isn&apos;t sitting and memorising, is because they are at school for six hours a day and there might be a benefit in varying the types of tasks? If my rhetoric does not convince you, perhaps the data will. A couple of weeks ago, the release of Pisa results caused some political handwringing. The tests, taken by 15-year-olds across 65 countries, ranked British students 23rd for reading, 26th for maths, and 20th for science. What almost everyone failed to mention is that as well as having their skills tested, students also completed a detailed survey about their schooling. This was very revealing. Inconveniently for the government&apos;s narrative, when answering questions about the types of activities they do in class, British students report doing many more &quot;traditional&quot; activities than &quot;progressive&quot; ones. Compared with high-performing nations such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Finland and Estonia, British students are more likely to learn materials by heart and have clear learning goals set for them by the teacher in each lesson. Half of British students reported that their teacher tells them what to do in every lesson, compared to just a quarter of students in Hong Kong and Finland. This sounds a lot like the &quot;teacher-centred&quot; approach that Liz Truss would have us believe was banished during the 1960s. Could this be because British students tend to over-report and say they have done activities when they haven&apos;t? If so, we would expect them to report high levels of non-traditional activities, too. But they don&apos;t. Only 6% of British students said they work in groups in every lesson and only 8% said the teacher commonly allows students a say in the planning of the lesson (two activities often considered &quot;progressive&quot;). Both figures were lower than the OECD averages for these activities, and a lot lower than Singaporean students experienced, even though Singapore is often praised by Michael Gove. The data also contradicts the idea that teachers carry the &quot;soft bigotry of low expectations&quot; \u2013 an incantation repeated more than once by the education secretary. Nearly half of British students strongly agreed with the statement that their teacher encouraged them to work hard. Only a quarter of Hong Kong students and less than one in five Korean students felt the same. An even more inconvenient truth emerges about private schools. Commonly heralded as the last bastion of &quot;traditional&quot; schooling, my own research using the 2009 Pisa data found that while state school pupils reported more traditional teaching, private school students reported higher rates of being asked to express opinions in class, completing group work, and having their teacher relate learning to their lives. So if there is a hotbed of progressivism in Britain, it probably isn&apos;t the state schools. One can only wonder how they manage to learn over the noise. \u2022 Laura McInerney taught in London for six years and is now a Fulbright scholar"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/dec/17/firefox-botnet-mavericks", "sentences": ["Xiaomi&apos;s plan for expansion is to invade the two most saturated smartphone markets in the world &gt;&gt; Quartz  So how does Xiaomi possibly think that it can gain a foothold in Singapore, Malaysia, and eventually the rest of the world?", "Since subsidized phones are more common in Singapore and Malaysia, Xiaomi could potentially offer its desirable handsets for free in those countries with the price of a carrier contract."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-17T07:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Firefox botnet, Mavericks.1, Nokia dumps Android, and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Botnet enlists Firefox users to hack websites &gt;&gt; Krebs on Security Brian Krebs:   An unusual botnet that has ensnared more than 12,500 systems disguises itself as a legitimate add-on for Mozilla Firefox\u00a0and forces infected PCs to scour Web sites for security vulnerabilities, an investigation by KrebsOnSecurity has discovered.

Nokia abandons Peter Skillman led Android adaptation plans, refocuses on wearables, smart glasses for 2015 &gt;&gt; Unwired View  According to CTech sources, the decision to shelve work on Android devices was made without direct Microsoft intervention. Android development was done under the Nokia CTO office, which stays with Nokia and is not part of Microsoft deal. So those Normandy phones will not be moving to Redmond anytime soon. However, in my opinion, now that Nokia shareholders overwhelmingly approved the sale of Nokia mobile division to Microsoft, as did most of world&apos;s regulatory agencies\u00a0\u2013 the decision to abandon the project is the logical outcome. According to the terms of the contract, Nokia is not allowed to sell phones, smartphones or tablets under its name for the next 2 years. They could theoretically create a mobile Android device under a new brand, but given the level of competition in the market, competency, manufacturing, logistical and distribution base that is transferring to Microsoft, it makes little sense.  In the words of the dinosaur in Toy Story 2, &quot;Oh well, we tried.&quot; Where I Save Windows Phone &gt;&gt; Tech.pinions Brian S Hall:   I have spent the past 4 years using iPhones as my go-to device. I have spent the past several weeks using the Lumia 1520 almost exclusively.\u00a0In nearly every case, I&apos;ve found an app equivalent for Windows Phone to match my iPhone. Unfortunately, nearly everyone is awful. Limited functionality, poor to no integration with web services (or iPhone apps), bad design. Indeed, the\u00a0vast majority of apps in the Windows Phone store appear to me as little more than high school projects. End this anti-user behavior. Ensure that any app offered from your store is absolutely awesome and in no way a pale, brittle facsimile of what&apos;s long been available for iOS and Android. Reject far more apps than you accept. Fifty thousand great apps is better than 150,000 awful ones. I also recommend you pledge every single of the many billions of dollars you receive from Android patent scofflaws to fund app projects with the very best app development houses. Bonus: offer huge cash windfalls for successful tie-ins with your very best mobile offerings (Skydrive, Bing, Office, Skype).  It&apos;s good advice - especially what he then suggests about advertising. Subsidization and Saturation | strat\u0113chery by Ben Thompson Ben Thompson:   Broadly speaking, there are three ways to grow: increase prices, lower costs, or gain new customers. The iPhone was such a coup for AT&amp;T because it accomplished two of those: the Average Price Per Unit (ARPU) of an iPhone user was significantly higher than a feature phone user (increased prices), and AT&amp;T stole Apple-loyal customers from the other carriers, particularly Verizon (gain new customers). Over time, more smartphones came into the market, and the iPhone spread to other carriers, but all those smartphones had the same higher ARPU. AT&amp;T and all the other carriers could achieve earnings growth simply by selling feature phone customers smartphones and the associated higher monthly fees that accompanied them. That gravy train is nearly over though, and once it becomes more difficult to raise prices (because there are no more feature phone customers to upgrade to smartphones), the remaining option for growth is gaining new users. And, given the fact that nearly everyone in America will soon have a smartphone, that means stealing customers from other carriers.  But how do you do that? Court says Apple did not violate Samsung patents &gt;&gt; ABC News  A Seoul court denied Samsung&apos;s claim that Apple violated three of its patent related to short message services. A judge at Seoul Central District Court said Thursday that two of Samsung patents lacked &quot;progressivity&quot; and can be easily developed by others. He said one patent was not used in the iPad. Samsung Electronics Co. sued Apple in March 2012 accusing the iPhone maker of illegally using its three patented technologies. It sought compensation and a ban on sales of six iPhone and iPad models, which include models still available in the market, such as the model with Retina display known as the fourth-generation iPad.  Superficially, Samsung&apos;s legal strategy resembles Apple&apos;s, but the outcome seems to be different. Mobile Trends Infographic: what SMBs connect &gt;&gt; Intermedia Intermedia provides &quot;Office in the cloud&quot; with a secure login system, and it activates smartphones. From January to October it activated nearly a quarter of a million devices; 76% from Apple, 12% from Samsung, 5% Motorola, 2% HTC, 3% &quot;other Android&quot;, and 1% Windows Phone. (And 1% BlackBerry.) There&apos;s more too (though be warned - it&apos;s an infographic, so might not work well on mobile). Xiaomi&apos;s plan for expansion is to invade the two most saturated smartphone markets in the world &gt;&gt; Quartz  So how does Xiaomi possibly think that it can gain a foothold in Singapore, Malaysia, and eventually the rest of the world? First, the company has shown itself to be a deft practitioner of sophisticated marketing. That includes social media &quot;flash sales&quot; and the cultivation of a devoted base of users, who contribute ideas about how to improve Xiaomi&apos;s Miui operating system (a \u00a0modified version of Android). Second, its phones, which offer high-end specs commonly found in trophy handsets like the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, are significantly cheaper, even without telecom operator subsidies. Since subsidized phones are more common in Singapore and Malaysia, Xiaomi could potentially offer its desirable handsets for free in those countries with the price of a carrier contract. Even if that&apos;s enough to crack the world&apos;s toughest smartphone markets, it may not directly lead to profits for Xiaomi. Its profit margin on handsets is tiny, so\u00a0its business model relies on selling apps, games, and other content to users. That means it will have to develop customized offerings that appeal to customers in each new market.  Could be an effective new business model.

Authorities have found it difficult to tackle pollution, but recognising the scale of the challenge, governments, laboratories and universities in China are now working intensively and collaboratively to better understand sources of air pollution and how they are dispersed or concentrated in the atmosphere.\u00a0 The country&apos;s five-year action plan has provisons to improve environment technology, planning and regulation. Its focus is on &quot;air pollution control led by government, enforced by companies, driven by market and participated in by the public&quot;. It emphasises on making polluters pay and rewarding energy efficiency, conservation and emissions reduction efforts. The plan also aims at reducing heavy pollution by a large margin and improve air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei province, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. Currently the public and private sector use computer models to simulate how emissions from transportation, power plants and industry affect the atmosphere.\u00a0This information is then used to determine levels of concentration of toxic gases and particles at street level. \u00a0 Increasingly, more cities are now monitoring air quality in real time using meteorological towers and remote sensing from satellites to track pollutants.\u00a0In Beijing concentrations of micro particles in the atmosphere have been found to be more than 10 times the safe level recommended by the WHO. This has prompted authorities to take measures such as limiting industrial emissions and reducing traffic across the nation. In Shenzhen and Guangzhou air pollution levels are now decreasing after peaking in 2007.\u00a0Air quality in Shanghai is also recognised as better than in Beijing.\u00a0In part, this is because Shanghai now has strict regulations for ships entering its harbours and has advised that vessels should both switch to cleaner fuels when they are about 100 miles away, and make use of electrical power when they have docked.\u00a0 \u00a0 But even in these cities the haze is so thick that often in winter it blocks out the sun, reducing natural light and warmth significantly.\u00a0As a result temperature drops, households use more energy for heating; pollution gets worse, causing respiratory diseases and eventually more people are hospitalised. However, improvements could be made with more data becoming accessible and fed into simulation models to provide accurate assessments of how changes to transportation, industry and power plants and even agricultural practice could help to reduce pollution.\u00a0Dust and pollution concentrations can also be reduced by better overall planning, including size and type of economic activity, designs of buildings, roadways and green spaces. \u00a0 China is also applying existing technologies more extensively.\u00a0This is resulting in cleaner emissions from power stations, replacement of coal-power heating systems with electric and gas-fired systems, and bio-processing of agricultural waste (rather than burning which adds to pollution).\u00a0The government&apos;s aim is to reduce the country&apos;s coal consumption to below 65% by 2017. The country is also taking up affordable battery-driven cycles, priced at $200. In the near future, roadside detectors will be able to monitor emissions from individual cars. Already, trams and buses with monitors are able to survey street pollution more thoroughly.\u00a0 Air pollution can also be forecast a few days ahead, even on a street by street basis, by using models of how traffic and atmosphere are likely to change.\u00a0This will help tourists, cyclists and others to avoid polluted areas. Smart traffic systems to lessen congestion on roads are also being considered. These are already being trialled in Singapore. \u00a0 Air pollution continue to pose a serious health risk in China but efforts are underway to clean up the air. The government has set up special funds to subsidise environmental-friendly industries, it is improving policies on pricing and taxation and encouraging private funds to invest in air pollution control technology. There are also plans to rank air quality of key cities regularly and establish mandatory environmental information disclosure system for companies causing heavy pollution.

Today, such practices strike us as profoundly misguided, even horrifying. As an executive in the water industry and a member of the so-called &quot;millennial generation&quot;, I believe that many communities will begin to reuse substantially all of their water within my lifetime, and we will look back at today&apos;s wasteful water practices with a similar sense of horror. In 2050, I will be 70. Between now and then, 2.4 billion thirsty people will be born into a world that is already straining to support today&apos;s water needs. Water demand will grow 55% to support rising food, energy and industrial production, and climate change may inflict water stress on 40% of the world&apos;s population. For this future world to be healthy, prosperous and environmentally sustainable, we must quickly turn water reuse into the global &quot;new normal&quot;. Conservation will play an important role: we can and must do more to save water. However, rising demand and the need to return more water to depleted ecosystems will outpace our ability to find efficiencies. Today&apos;s population is already withdrawing water from rivers, lakes and aquifers at unsustainable rates; nearly 30,000 rivers and streams have disappeared in China, groundwater levels have dropped precipitously in the American Midwest, and land subsidence has created massive fissures in my home state of Arizona. We cannot economise our way to a water-abundant future; new and sustainable sources are needed. While seawater desalination is gaining in popularity, it is expensive, energy-intensive, and only viable in coastal areas. Fortunately, the solution stares us in the face every time we do laundry, wash dishes, or use the bathroom: systematic water reuse. Water reuse is a &quot;triple bottom line&quot; solution to the challenges of water scarcity: by giving water a second, third or fourth life, water reuse technologies promote ecosystem health, economic development and community resilience. The core economic, epidemiological and technical questions about water reuse have largely been answered: we know how to treat wastewater reliably and economically to drinking water standards. In India, Xylem&apos;s facility in the state of Gujarat uses aeration, ultra-filtration and UV disinfection systems to purify wastewater to the point that it is fit for human consumption. Proven, economical water reuse technologies are already supplying communities from Orange County to Singapore with renewed water from a mix of sources, including gently used municipal wastewater. In fact, many of us are already drinking high-quality reused water \u2013 even if we don&apos;t know it.  The drinking water supply of Fairfax Water, which serves 1.7 million in Northern Virginia, has been including recycled wastewater since the 1970s. In Texas, a $14m (\u00a38.55m) plant in Big Spring has begun turning treated wastewater into drinking water, distributing about two million gallons daily to the Midland-Odessa area. In Perth, Australia, Water Corp aims to use reclaimed water to provide 10% of the region&apos;s drinking water supply. But moving water reuse from the exception to the rule will require overcoming a powerful barrier: our own outmoded, if understandable concern about drinking what people think of as &quot;toilet water&quot;. And no matter what the science says, social theorists from Emile Durkheim to Mary Douglas have made it clear that our sense of purity and disgust has little to do with science and everything to do with tradition and community standards. Unfortunately, shifting public perceptions is far more difficult than even the most challenging feats of process engineering. We can begin the journey with the low-hanging fruit of non-potable reuse. Use of recycled water in industrial applications or landscape irrigation is already common in many parts of the world, and the growth potential is enormous. We should be asking why we have waited so long: water for power plants, golf courses and toilet flushing doesn&apos;t need to be the same quality as the water our families drink. Places as disparate as California and Namibia, subject to chronic water shortages, have used recycled water for non-potable applications for decades. But to pave the way for a sustainable water future, we will also need to engage and inform the public to change attitudes toward water reuse of all kinds. Success is possible; according to a survey by GE, while the majority of Americans remain hesitant about drinking reused water, people in other parts of the world, including China and Singapore are far more receptive. Research from CH2MHill shows great potential for broader acceptance in the US \u2013 but only if we can tell the story more effectively. Public awareness of the value of water must rise, so people view water as a cherished resource that deserves to be conserved and recycled. Fortunately, social trends are creating an inflection point in the acceptance of new technologies to solve environmental challenges, including water. Communities around the world are facing a simultaneous unemployment crisis and water crisis; investment in reuse infrastructure can support job creation and economic development by increasing the supply of water available for industry. In the US, the millennial generation \u2013 whose members the Pew Charitable Trust calls &quot;confident, connected and open to change&quot; \u2013 is facing the results of decades of under-investment in infrastructure that imperil our future water supply. But if America recycled all the wastewater effluent dumped each day into its waterways, it could increase water supply by nearly 30%, securing the future and creating room for growth. The year 2050 is not so far away, and we will have to live with decisions made today about water infrastructure. Water reuse gives us a meaningful opportunity to bend the arc toward a more sustainable future. With more countries around the world experiencing water stress, it is time for all of us to get over the &quot;ick factor,&quot; raise a glass to the future, and take a drink.

Tricia Kelleher accused the education secretary of &quot;pressing the rewind button&quot; and warned that attempts to chase global education-league rankings will lead schools into a creativity-free &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; of learning. The head of the independent Stephen Perse Foundation in Cambridge said Gove was living in a parallel universe in which he bulldozed through reforms to qualifications and failed to recognise the importance of learning itself, including the role of new digital technologies in the classroom. Stephen Perse equips each secondary-age pupil with an iPad and is working with Apple to publish its own curriculum apps. It is also contemplating abandoning handwriting in favour of screen-only working. Kelleher rejected Gove&apos;s recent ridiculing of the use of popular cultural references, such as Mr Men and Disney, as learning tools: &quot;Why not, if they contribute to understanding and learning?&quot; She said modern pupils had a hugely varied cultural landscape. &quot;I think the sober study of classic literature and dry narrative history do not register highly. Young people need an approach which connects with them and the values in their world.&quot; Kelleher&apos;s criticisms come just days after the headmaster of Eton college, Tony Little, warned that a relentless focus on exams and assessment targets in schools risks turning teachers into &quot;functionaries in a service industry&quot;. He had never seen a generation of teachers who defined &quot;their purpose as teachers in such a limited way&quot;. Calls from the private sector \u2013 unbound by the national curriculum and other restrictions affecting state-sector colleagues \u2013 for less central intervention and greater trust in teachers&apos; professionalism come against a backdrop of continuing, far-reaching educational reform. Gove is pushing through a programme combining structural change \u2013 creating academies and free schools \u2013 sweeping qualification reform and revision of the national curriculum. Focus on the UK&apos;s education performance was renewed last week as the latest Programme for International Student Achievement (Pisa), published by the OECD, showed Britain languishing mid-table in reading, maths and science tests taken by 15-year-olds. The league table, whose UK results reflect the performance of children educated mainly under the last Labour government, was topped by east Asian countries, including China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea. Kelleher, whose school recorded the joint top score worldwide in the international baccalaureate diploma in the Sunday Times table published last month, urged Gove not to narrow education goals to the pursuit of Pisa scores: &quot;My worry is we are now going to be driven towards Pisa because Pisa becomes the next altar we worship at. But it is really a cul-de-sac in learning terms.&quot; She said Pisa took no account of individual countries&apos; cultural differences, including the unrelenting pressure on pupils in top-performing countries, nor did they recognise the creativity of British learning. &quot;If Michael Gove is saying we should just value what is in Pisa, then we might as well just collapse the curriculum and teach what will come top.&quot; Acknowledging the privileged position of her \u00a35,000-a-term selective school, many of whose pupils are the children of Cambridge academics, Kelleher insisted that an approach focusing on sparking the imaginations of children applied across the schools landscape. In a recent personal blogpost \u2013 she also blogs for the Guardian \u2013 Kelleher cited her own experience as a 13-year-old, when a BBC mini-series of War and Peace inspired her to read Tolstoy&apos;s epic work, awakening a life-long love of history. &quot;I am sure Gove would approve of such cultural aspiration from a working-class daughter of Irish immigrants, yet I should never have even considered reading such a vast tome without the stimulus of the TV series,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Just as the medium of television opened up the world of Tolstoy to me, today television is just one of a multitude of possibilities for engaging the young.&quot; Gove&apos;s dismissal of &quot;low-brow&quot; cultural references missed the point, she argued. &quot;The digital world is a game-changer, and we must change with it. If Angry Birds, the staple digital game of many youngsters, inspires a young person to learn coding, surely that is a desirable outcome? &quot;If the GarageBand app provides a creative platform for an aspiring young musician, isn&apos;t this to be applauded? We are on the nursery slopes of digital learning. The potential for transformation of the conventional educational paradigm is extraordinary. Yet none of this registers in the world of the secretary of state for education. It strikes me that Gove&apos;s well-meaning attempt to promote excellence for all young people is being enacted in a parallel universe.&quot; Angry Birds had not featured on her curriculum, Kelleher said, though pupils were queuing up to learn computer coding in other ways. But music teaching included the use of GarageBand to enable non-musicians to arrange music. The school also encouraged pupils to submit some homework as films, and teachers gave some feedback via audio rather than writing, while geography course materials were all screen-based. Handwriting would be maintained while exam boards continued to require it, but its use would be reassessed if that changed. Kelleher added her voice to concerns over the revised history curriculum, which will focus on a chronological account of Britain&apos;s &quot;island story&quot;. &quot;Imagine if you taught children history without Mandela, for example. Of course we should understand what happened in this country, because it is part of the cultural core that brings us together, but not to be looking around the world is just foolhardy. Our children are global citizens. &quot;Michael Gove is looking back to the past: he is hitting the rewind button because he says that is raising standards. But it should be about improving learning.&quot; A Department for Education spokesperson said: &quot;The simple fact is our education system is not keeping up with the rest of the world. Our reforms will reverse this situation and give our young people the best chance of success. &quot;Through academies and free schools we are giving thousands of brilliant heads and teachers the freedom to innovate on their curriculums and teach in more creative ways than ever to inspire their pupils. &quot;We are reforming teacher training to attract the brightest, most innovative graduates, ending grade inflation and introducing demanding qualifications which match the world&apos;s best.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/2013-disasters-asia-typhoon-haiyan-rana-plaza", "sentences": ["These blanketed southeast Asia in the worst haze it experienced in 16 years and reduced visibility in ultra-modern Singapore to under 100 metres."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T15:38:00Z", "title": "2013: a year of disasters for Asia that we're all to blame for", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Asia Pacific", "Bangladesh", "Indonesia", "Typhoon Haiyan", "Rana Plaza"], "article": "Now is typically the season for looking back on the year&apos;s events and reflecting on what they have taught us. A good starting point is an image, posted online in May, which provides a valuable lesson. It drew a circle centered on Hong Kong with a radius of roughly 2,500 miles (or about a four or five hour flight). Within this circle is the majority of the world&apos;s population. 2013 was not a good year for the people inside this circle. They suffered through the Indonesian forest fires in June and July, the result of slash-and burn logging that destroyed vast swathes of Indonesia&apos;s tropical rainforest. These blanketed southeast Asia in the worst haze it experienced in 16 years and reduced visibility in ultra-modern Singapore to under 100 metres. More recently, Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest storm ever to make landfall in recorded history, destroyed entire villages and towns and killed over 5,000 people in the Philippines alone, making it the deadliest typhoon in that nation&apos;s history. Both of these events look like acts of nature \u2013 tragic but unpreventable. And yet they are part of a larger string of events that are in one way or another, the result of actions and decisions made by man. Take the forest fires in Indonesia. Forest fires are nothing new, but the fires that have contributed to Indonesia losing 20% of its forest cover over the past two decades have little in common with the blazes in California and Australia that so often make the headlines. These fires are the product of clearance methods used by palm oil and logging companies to keep costs low and output high. Many commentators have pointed this out yet almost none have gone one step further to identify the root cause of the problem \u2013 our relentless desire globally for ever increasing quantities of cheap goods. Palm oil \u2013 which is used to produce everything from biscuits to cooking oil to shampoo to bio-fuel and is a key ingredient in the fast food explosion \u2013 is the product that much of the forests have been cleared to produce. This, combined with the massive international demand for hardwoods, sealed the fate of the forests. The necessity of keeping costs low requires that most important steps involved in producing goods are simply not included in their final cost. With palm oil, that includes the rapid depletion in soil quality where oil palms are planted, the acres of forest cleared to make room for them and the resulting loss in bio-diversity, and the effluent generated by processing plants which has polluted far too many rivers. Were any of these costs reflected in the final price, palm oil would be many times more expensive than it is and so would our groceries \u2013 but far fewer forests would be lost. Raj Patel&apos;s famous example is of the $200 hamburger (\u00a3122), 1which takes into account the fifty-five square feet of cleared rainforest and 2,393 liters of water it can take to produce. A $200 hamburger may not sound great, but the result of under-pricing resources is that we consume vastly more than is or even good for us. It is impossible, of course, to say with any certainty that climate change was the direct cause of any particular storm. But the fact remains that Typhoon Haiyan came the same year that CO2 levels reached 400ppm, their highest point in at least two and a half million years and possibly far longer. A closer look reveals that the very same under-pricing and consumption habits that create incentives to clear forests and grow ever more palm oil have also warmed the planet&apos;s oceans, which, as scientists have long known, intensifies the severity of phenomenon such as typhoons. This conclusion has unfortunately been borne out time and again in countries such as the Philippines, which was hit by nearly twice as many storms this decade as it was only twenty years ago. Another event that made headlines this year was the tragic collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, which killed more than 1,000 people. This too is part of the same economic logic of keeping production costs low to promote consumption. Resources are not the only thing that can be underpriced; labor is as well. The 5,000 people who worked in the building were there because their work was cheap. The textile industry is notorious for its willingness to ignore any concerns about safety, health and labor rights in search of the lowest prices but this kind of predatory behavior is a product of consumers worldwide demanding ever cheaper clothes. Even cotton, the industry&apos;s material of choice, is often called the &quot;world&apos;s dirtiest crop&quot; because of the sheer volume of insecticides used in its cultivation. Despite covering only 2.5% of the world&apos;s cultivated land, cotton used a staggering 16% of its insecticides. Not only do these chemicals damage the environment; they harm the health of the often untrained and unprotected farmers who use them. None of this is paid for by the consumers of the endless supply of cheap clothing. The model of growth through relentless consumption, which thrives on under-pricing and which has caused much of this damage, has become part of the accepted orthodoxy amongst politicians, business leaders and economists. In part, it&apos;s because of an unwillingness to confront hard truths but also because of the influence of vested interests who shape the rules to suit themselves. The more dramatic consequences of this sad reality have been all too apparent this year, but there are other equally important changes happening just out of sight. There are no easy fixes to these problems as we have been heading in the wrong direction for too long for that to be the case. But Asian governments must step up and recognise that a growth-at-any-cost model that served the world well in the 20th century is no longer applicable and that it is far past time to stop aping western lifestyles. If the people inside the circle don&apos;t take action, it won&apos;t much matter what the people outside it do. Chandran Nair is founder and CEO of the Global Institute for Tomorrow.

Ben Bernanke, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, has turned down the throttle on quantitative easing and calm has prevailed. As the Fed said, monthly purchases of assets will be reduced from $85bn to $75bn (\u00a346bn), stock markets rose and bond markets helpfully went sideways. The baby-steps nature of the Fed&apos;s action was one reason. Another was the assurance that interest rates will stay at next to nothing for ages \u2013 or &quot;well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6.5%&quot;. It&apos;s a long way from the terrors of the summer, when markets worried that even a modest reduction in the dosage of printed money would cause the recovery to falter. A lot of jobs have been added since then, and the US economic data is strong. So confidence in a self-sustaining recovery is more robust than in the weeks when a shutdown in Washington was leading the financial news. All the same, the route to the exit from quantitative easing looks hellishly tricky. The undertaking itself can be deemed a success in the sense that a great global depression may have been averted. And, if the recovery continues to be strong, there&apos;s no problem. Janet Yellen, Bernanke&apos;s successor, would be able to accelerate the tapering of quantitative easing and be applauded. But what if \u2013 next May, say \u2013 the Fed&apos;s monthly habit is down to $45bn, but the employment numbers are softening, growth in the US is weakening and the housing market is faltering? What would be the correct response? In theory, it might be time to hit the accelerator again, perhaps returning to $65bn-a-month. But an about-turn \u2013 halfway through a taper programme \u2013 would send an incredibly weak message. The Fed would stand accused of misjudging the underlying strength of the recovery. Sceptics of quantitative easing would have a field-day, arguing that another increase in an ineffective medicine would be the very worst prescription. Credibility, then, rests on the single premise that the US recovery will continue to be strong and allow a full, gradual and uninterrupted reduction in the asset-buying programme. Life may indeed turn out so sweetly. But a weak patch for the US economy \u2013 not the consensus view, but obviously a possibility \u2013 would test faith in central bankers&apos; magic. The UK form of quantitative easing involved fixed amounts and an imprecise deadline: when the quota was filled, no more gilts were bought until the Bank&apos;s monetary policy committee gave a new mandate. The UK design looks superior to the US version, which uses a rolling monthly programme, thereby creating the illusion that this experimental monetary machine is a finely calibrated instrument. In truth, it&apos;s nothing of the sort, and that fact may cause trouble on the way out. Nobody can really know whether $5bn, $10bn, or $20bn, is the right pace of reduction for the US; or, indeed, whether an immediate halt would produce very different results. Nevertheless, markets will obsess over every tweak of the dial. Yellen is up against it. Last-minute promotional games December 21: time to start the Christmas shopping. It&apos;s only now that retailers display their real prices, as opposed to those they offer suckers who think Christmas starts in mid-November with the blitz of sugary TV adverts. Once again, half the retail industry is surprised that many shoppers are waiting for &quot;sale&quot; stickers to appear before buying. What did they expect? If they play the &quot;last-minute bargains&quot; card year after year, the punters will adapt. Marks &amp; Spencer is where the City analysts have turned their spotlight. The group has been running promotions with increasing intensity all week, heightening the worry that M&amp;S is on course for another seasonal shocker. Surprisingly, perhaps, there&apos;s sympathy for the chief executive, Marc Bolland. The mild winter hasn&apos;t helped clothing retailers; the new, revamped, clothing ranges were never likely to provide instant salvation; and M&amp;S, even in Sir Stuart Rose&apos;s day, played last-minute promotional games. Come on, though, part of the skill in retailing is matching supply and demand. The only certainty about pre-Christmas sales is that customers who paid full-price in recent weeks will be irritated. On M&amp;S&apos;s latest promotion, analyst Nick Bubb says: &quot;Whether it will turn out to be worth doing in the short-term, just to try to save the CEO&apos;s job, remains to be seen, but the M&amp;S brand will suffer long-term damage.&quot; Fair comment. To be fair, M&amp;S shareholders should reserve judgment on Christmas trading until the hard profit numbers are in. But, if it&apos;s bad news, investors should not accept slippery excuses. Arch-rival Next (now worth \u00a31bn more than M&amp;S in stock market value) seems to be able, consistently, to start its sales on Boxing Day without suffering problems with excess stock. Why can&apos;t M&amp;S? Hunting for a deal Complicated name, complicated incentive arrangements. Well, what did you expect from Bob Diamond, boss of Barclays until the last governor of the Bank of England ensured he wasn&apos;t? Atlas Mara Co-Nvest, an adventure into banking in Africa (probably, but nothing is guaranteed), raised $325m this week and can now start hunting for a deal. The founders, led by Diamond, are putting up $20m for a slice of the cake but, naturally, they hope their portion will yield extra cherries. Here&apos;s the formula: after a deal, holders of &quot;founder preferred shares&quot; will collect 20% of the increase in Atlas Mara Co-Nvest&apos;s value provided the gain is at least 15%. This 20% cut will continue to be paid, in shares, every year for seven years so long as the company&apos;s value passes the previous year&apos;s peak. The 20% structure is no more greedy than those demanded by top-end hedge fund managers and private equity principals. And, yes, there&apos;s an alignment of interest of sorts. Even so, it&apos;s remarkable that Diamond can command such a price. It&apos;s not as if Barclays Capital, the investment bank he built, has created much long-term sustainable value for Barclays. A time for calm? Aberdeen Asset Management is in the middle of a big deal: the \u00a3550m purchase from Lloyds Banking Group of Scottish Widows Investment Partnership. A moment, you might think, for directors to calm investors by refraining from selling shares. Not a bit of it. Andrew Laing, deputy chief executive, cashed in \u00a35.3m this week. Chief executive Martin Gilbert sold shares worth \u00a38.6m at the start of the month. Hugh Young, star fund manager in Singapore, banked \u00a35.5m at the same time. The disposals all flowed from the multi-year bonus and incentive schemes. And sales in December, we are told, are a regular practice at Aberdeen, a company that rewards its board with shares. All the same, a display of directors&apos; greed for the long-term prize would have gone down better."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/dec/21/hm-uniqlo-and-ms-compete-for-a-place-on-australias-high-streets", "sentences": ["\u201cAustralian consumers today travel regularly overseas to the UK, US, Europe and Asia and they only have to walk down the streets of somewhere like New York or Singapore to see all the big brands."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-21T04:36:52Z", "title": "H&M, Uniqlo and M&S compete for a place on Australia's high streets", "tags": ["Uniqlo", "H&M", "Australia news", "Zara", "Topshop", "Retail industry", "Fashion", "Marks & Spencer"], "article": "Australia\u2019s high street battle is set to explode in early 2014. If there was any lingering doubt of the country\u2019s clout as a global retail and fashion destination, that will be dismissed when the latest influx of major international fast fashion players \u2013 Sweden\u2019s H&amp;M and Japan\u2019s Uniqlo \u2013 hit our shores early next year. While unconfirmed, the whispers continue to get louder that Forever 21 from the US and iconic British department store Marks &amp; Spencer are also Australia-bound. M&amp;S Leasing Executives are reportedly eyeing a site in a planned $72m redevelopment on George Street in Sydney&apos;s CBD that will see a soaring office and retail precinct, tram and pedestrian walkway. This all comes hot on the heels of the hyped and highly successful 2011 and 2012 launches of Zara and Topshop (from Spain and the UK respectively), which signaled the beginning of the high street revolution. H&amp;M, the world\u2019s second biggest retailer (behind Zara) with annual sales of $18.13bn (US) will open its doors in Melbourne\u2019s GPO building in the first half of 2014. The brand is famed for its collaborations with hot right-now-designers \u2013 the latest Isabel Marant for H&amp;M line which launched in November saw customers camping out the previous evening with coveted items sold out in minutes. A three-level 3000 square metre site on Sydney&apos;s George Street is set to follow Melbourne, and a Brisbane site is also being considered. The Sydney branch will complete what experts have dubbed the Golden Triangle \u2013 a reference both to its prime CBD location and proximity to Zara and Top Shop. Also intent on shaking up the local fashion landscape is Japanese retailer Uniqlo, purveyor of colourful denim and cashmere sweaters at cheap and cheerful prices. A branch is opening in Melbourne in early 2014 with a Sydney store to follow. What Uniqlo lacks in design direction it makes up for in covetable simplicity, which experts predict will be a welcome addition to Aussie wardrobes. Ditto California\u2019s Forever 21, the fast fashion juggernaut aimed at the youth market, which generates annual revenue of $3.7bn (US). The company is believed to be scouting for a site on Pitt Street Mall, which underwent a $1.2bn overhaul in 2010 to become Westfield Sydney, enticing the big guns of Zara and Gap in the process. The availability of expansive multilevel flagship stores in Westfield meant the international brands could finally open stores in Australia. Indeed such has been the success of our first designer mega-mall that the likes of Chanel, Gucci, Prada and Miu Miu have all happily taken up residence behind the churn-and-burn high street brands. \u201cWe\u2019ve got more and more retailers coming to Australia and why wouldn\u2019t they? We\u2019ve got a very stable market and economy and nothing like the 25% unemployment rate of somewhere like Spain,&quot; says Russell Zimmermann, executive director of Australian Retailers Association. \u201cAustralian consumers today travel regularly overseas to the UK, US, Europe and Asia and they only have to walk down the streets of somewhere like New York or Singapore to see all the big brands. They understand it, they love it and they want it.&quot;     Customers at the Isabel Marant sale at H&amp;M in Regent St, London. Photograph: David Levene    The Aussie consumer, the undisputed winner in all this, is driving international demand. Where once Australians had to travel overseas to buy the latest catwalk-inspired pieces, today that can be fulfilled by the likes of Zara, Topshop and Muji (which opened its first Australian store in Chadstone Melbourne last month). Even chains that have not yet opened bricks and mortar stores have still descended online \u2013 fashion retailers Net-A-Porter, Asos, JCrew and Next have all launched Australian sites in response to demand. What impact will heavyweight international brands will have on the local market? Zimmermann believes the competition has forced Australia&apos;s long-established homegrown brands to reinvigorate. \u201cBefore Zara many retailers were complacent in Australia, plodding along with just four seasons. But Zara offering new stock and freshness every two to four weeks has taught us a lot, \u201d says Zimmermann. He cites Forever New, Country Road and Cotton On as \u201cfantastic examples of Aussie brands\u201d who have helped raise the high street bar. Founded in 1974, a decade ago Country Road was in the doldrums but has emerged in recent years as a fully-fledged fashion and lifestyle brand, praised for consistently good, on-trend pieces. In August, Seed (the nearest Australia has to J Crew) rebranded as Seed Heritage in a bid to expand into Asia. Portmans and Kookai, meanwhile, have anointed Australian supermodels Jess Hart and Catherine McNeil as their glamorous faces to maintain kudos in an increasingly competitive market. But what will the arrival of M&amp;S mean for David Jones and Myer \u2013 already embroiled in their own store wars? Zimmermann believes there is room in the market for another department store. \u201cIt would be a challenge but our department stores have to reinvent themselves and both are working hard to get their model right and provided they do they will both be great retailers.\u201d As for whether the future is refined to a mega mall, Zimmermann says shoppers still crave a shopping strip. \u201cPitt Street is one of the best examples of a retail precinct getting it right. George Street will experience turmoil from 2015 to 2017 when they build the tram line, but what better way to get people moving through the CBD? It\u2019s going to be wonderful for the city and I don\u2019t buy the criticism about narrow streets. I\u2019ve stood on the sidewalk in Istanbul and literally touched the tram on one side and the store window on the other and that didn\u2019t stop anyone shopping.\u201d And Australians do continue to shop, to the tune of $42.2bn in pre-Christmas sales according to ARA, on booming high streets that experts predict will soon rival the likes of Fifth Avenue. \u201cOver the next five years I believe Australia will stand very proudly against the major cities of New York, Tokyo and Europe with a retail environment that is as good, if not better,\u201d says Zimmermann."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/dec/23/la-liga-pedro-barcelona-real-madrid-blog", "sentences": ["Talking points \u2022 Valencia have received a takeover bid from the Singapore billionaire Peter Lim."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-23T16:12:49Z", "title": "Canary Islanders Pedro and Jes\u00e9 swoop to save Barcelona and Real Madrid | Sid Lowe", "tags": ["La Liga", "Barcelona", "Real Madrid", "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid", "Getafe", "Valencia", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "They&apos;ll be celebrating on the forecourts of Santa Cruz.

It was the draw for El Gordo, the huge Christmas lottery, and there they were retrieving their balls from huge rotating baskets and chanting numbers, over and over, for hours, like mini Gregorian monks. All across the country people were waiting and when the chant went up, &quot;Seventy-nine thousand, seven hundred and tweeeee-eeelve!&quot;, they went wild down in the south-east of Tenerife.

When they picked up this morning&apos;s sports dailies, covers dedicated to the lottery results, 79,712 stood large among thousands of winning combinations \u2013 so many numbers there was barely room for anything else. Marca ran just two small football photos, squashed onto the right side: one was Jes\u00e9, the other was Pedro \u2026 the World Cup winner whose father pumped petrol at a forecourt barely 20km away. &quot;Pedro puts Barcelona back on top,&quot; the tiny title said. Over at Marca&apos;s Catalan counterparts the numbers had been tucked away inside, freeing up the front so the pictures were bigger, the headlines too. &quot;Super Pedro&quot; lauded Sport. &quot;Pedrooo!&quot; cheered El Mundo Deportivo.

It hadn&apos;t been a good week. Barcelona had been forced to hand over the paperwork relating to the signing of Neymar, El Mundo linked Leo Messi&apos;s benefit games to the laundering of drugs money, and then Messi had attacked the board, describing the club director Javier Faus as &quot;a man who knows nothing about football&quot; and pointedly insisting: &quot;Barcelona is the best club in the world and it deserves to have the best directors.&quot; There was, some in Catalonia said, a campaign against them from Madrid. On Sunday there really was. Well, from just south of Madrid, anyway. Getafe were tearing them apart. Less than quarter of an hour into Barcelona&apos;s trip to Getafe, they trailed 2-0 and it could have been more. Barcelona&apos;s &quot;defending&quot; had been awful. Piqu\u00e9 and Mascherano were isolated and overwhelmed: Escudero had dashed, unopposed to the edge of the six yard box to score the first while Lisandro L\u00f3pez had headed in a corner for the second, almost as close to the goal as anyone was to him. Ciprian Marica, the striker who arrived in Spain and promptly became known by his first name, had just wasted a great chance for the third. Xavi Hern\u00e1ndez was not on the pitch and nor was Messi or Neymar. Pinto, on the other hand, was. Getafe were confident. Under Luis Garc\u00eda they have been a disaster against the big teams away from home: they have never won at the Camp Nou, the Bernab\u00e9u or the Calder\u00f3n. But they had been defeated just twice in nine at home. And Barcelona knew that in the 10 years that Getafe have been in the top flight that when they don&apos;t win there they don&apos;t win the league. Now, as things stood, they were slipping off the top, three points behind Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and just two ahead of Real Madrid, who were still to play. That was when Pedro appeared. Racing on to Cesc F\u00e1bregas&apos;s clever pass, he clipped a shot over Miguel-\u00c1ngel Moya and into the net. Next, he received Andr\u00e9s Iniesta&apos;s quick curling ball, cut in from the left and thumped a beauty into the top corner, screeching into the stanchion. Then, he responded quickly to hit the third into the same side of the net after Jordi Alba&apos;s cut-back was blocked. When Pedro&apos;s first shot hit the net, the clock said 33.58; the second went in on 40.35 and the third flashed in as it ticked up to showed 42.12. In the week in which he had gone swimming with sharks at Barcelona&apos;s aquarium \u2013 insert your own diving joke here \u2013 Pedro not only became Barcelona&apos;s top scorer this season, he became their fastest striker ever. David Villa scored a hat-trick in four minutes for Valencia but this was the quickest hat-trick in Barcelona&apos;s history, level with Dani Garc\u00eda who got three versus Betis in 1999 (although his had a half-time in the way) and Laszlo Kubala&apos;s 74th to 82nd minute hat-trick against Sporting in 1953. Sometimes that line is absurdly fine. In eight minutes and 14 seconds, everything had changed. The tension lifted and the knives were put back. From the kind of defeat that would have deepened the divide, one that would have lingered over the winter break exacerbating the crisis that forever hangs over them, from sitting two points behind Atl\u00e9tico and only two ahead of Real Madrid, January&apos;s Atl\u00e9tico-Bar\u00e7a a threat rather than an opportunity, Barcelona were back on top. When they come back, Messi will be back and so will V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s. They had ridden out the storm and ultimately they had done so, as the Spanish phrase has it, by convincing as well as winning: they had not just vencido, they had convencido too. The former striker Pichi Alonso likened this to a victory from a different if very recent era. Gerardo Martino described the opening 15 minutes as fatal, awful. By the end, he could have justifiably talked about Barcelona&apos;s best performance of the season, swift, slick and incisive. All the more because they had come from two down. Amidt the inevitable talk of character, Martino was putting a different slant on it. Barcelona had, he said, remained faithful to the way they wanted to play, even as the pressure built. The first of their goals came with five men pressuring to win the ball on the touchline and a perfectly weighted pass from F\u00e1bregas&apos;s and Iniesta&apos;s perfectly weighted pass led to the second. The cliche talks of games that win leagues. This may just have been one of them. If Barcelona have never won the league when they have failed to win at Getafe, they have been champions every time they have won here. Emotionally, symbolically, it felt like a huge victory. And yet it was not the only one. All three championship contenders came out of the weekend and into the Christmas break relieved. All three had conceded twice, all there had been on edge. Both Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona had been losing and although Madrid hadn&apos;t, they&apos;d been closest to dropping points \u2013 and for Madrid, who started the weekend five points behind, that might have been fatal. In the end, three fascinating games brought 17 goals: Barcelona beat Getafe 5-2, Atl\u00e9tico beat Levante 3-2 with Diego Costa getting two more, and Real Madrid beat Valencia 3-2, with substitute Jes\u00e9 scoring the winner in the 81st minute. This was one of those weekends where the fact that the Spanish league is spread across 10 different time slots for the sake of TV is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because it meant you could watch them all; a curse because it loses the drama that comes when the contenders take to the field simultaneously, their fates in each others&apos; hands, when the table shifts constantly, everyone permanently on edge. From the first minute at the Calder\u00f3n to the 10th at the Coliseum to the 27th at Mestalla. Atl\u00e9tico down, Barcelona down, Madrid up, Atl\u00e9tico level, Madrid level, Barcelona too \u2026 minute by minute, points shifting, hopes and fears intertwining. Yet even this way it was dramatic, coming to a head in Valencia. Those final minutes at Mestalla were decisive. This was the last game of the weekend, the last of the year. By then, Madrid knew that Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico had won; the opportunity had been denied them, now they were confronted by an obligation. Madrid were drawing and far from dominant. 1-1, then 2-2, and seemingly some way from a 3-2, they stood seven points off, the title was slipping from their grasp. &quot;The league was getting too far away,&quot; admitted Jes\u00e9. Like Pedro, Jes\u00e9 is a Canary Islander. And, like Pedro, he appeared when his team needed him most. His shot went past Vicente Guaita at the near post and he headed off to the bench, sprinting and shouting, racing towards Zinedine Zidane and disappearing under a pile of bodies. &quot;This was the most important goal of my career,&quot; Jes\u00e9 said. Madrid had stayed in touch. Just. At the end of it all, when the dust settled and Monday morning&apos;s papers were out, the numbers showed that Real Madrid had 41 points, Atl\u00e9tico 46 and, thanks to Pedro, Barcelona 46. For a while it looked like they would forfeit that position but the fastest hat-trick in their history changed all that and Barcelona closed the year where they have spent the whole of 2013: on the top. Meanwhile, Pedro&apos;s petrol-pumping neighbours closed the year where they could never have imagined they would be. Down in Tenerife, they were sharing out \u20ac1.25m. Talking points \u2022 Valencia have received a takeover bid from the Singapore billionaire Peter Lim. According to the president Amadeo Salvo, who would carry on under Lim, the bid includes a willingness to assume the debt, which is around \u20ac250m, spend up to \u20ac40m on players in the winter window, and commit to finally completing the construction of the new Mestalla. Lim has given Valencia until 15 January to respond formally. Meanwhile, Bankia (effectively the club&apos;s owners after Valencia defaulted on loan repayments to them) are looking at other bids too. \u2022 So, Valencia to sign? Sevilla won at Villarreal, Athletic beat Rayo and Real Sociedad are flying again, defeating Granada 3-1 in Granada and playing lovely football. The fight for fourth could be pretty seriously tasty. \u2022 New manager, same old fate \u2026 Betis were beaten 1-0 at home by Almer\u00eda, for whom the veteran goalkeeper Esteban, who&apos;s three years older than his manager, performed miracles. Betis remain bottom and are five points adrift. At the end of the game, the scenes made it look like they were already down: new coach Juan Carlos Garrido made them head to the centre-circle to thanks the fans for their support, where there were songs and tears and bowed heads. \u2022 Could this just be the saddest remark of the year, one that is depressingly telling? Vicente del Bosque admitted that he had voted for Xavi and Iniesta for the Ball\u00f3n d&apos;Or in part so as to avoid &quot;a Real Madrid-Barcelona war.&quot; \u2022 A very Karim Benzema to everyone!

The boss of Nats, Britain&apos;s air traffic control service, had a nightmare start to the festive season two weeks ago when a computer glitch at Nats&apos; \u00a3623m Swanwick base in Hampshire caused delays to hundreds of flights. With millions of people leaving and arriving in Britain over Christmas and New Year, Nats needs things to run smoothly. Flights peaked at about 5,800 on Friday and Heathrow expects 1.5 million passengers to take off and land at the UK&apos;s busiest airport from Christmas Eve to New Year&apos;s Day. Deakin offers no guarantee against further Nats-induced delays but says the software problem that caused chaos on 7 December will not recur. &quot;That last event was a one-in-10-year event and that particular system is fixed. That system isn&apos;t going to fall over. As you can imagine, it&apos;s had a bit of attention. We&apos;re not proud of the disruption we caused people. Everyone at Nats was working flat out from the small hours of the morning to minimise the impact.&quot; He adds: &quot;My phone went off extremely early in the morning and I spent most of the day on the phone at Swanwick talking to the Department for Transport and the airlines.&quot; The disruption came ahead of the biggest event of the year for Britain&apos;s aviation industry: last week&apos;s publication of the Davies commission&apos;s interim proposals for expanding UK airport capacity. Deakin says the two subjects are linked because Britain&apos;s airspace operates at maximum capacity. That means any disruption has knock-on effects throughout the day because there is no slack in the system to reschedule flights, unlike at Paris&apos;s Charles De Gaulle airport and Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, which run at about 70% of their full capacity. &quot;We need to plan for capacity, resilience and growth. We need to add resilient capacity instead of continuing to run at 100%,&quot; Deakin says. In his interim report, Sir Howard Davies proposed three firm options for increasing airport space in the South East: adding a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing Heathrow runway, and a new runway at Gatwick. He said he would consider mayor of London Boris Johnson&apos;s proposal for a giant new airport in north Kent, although a green-light is deemed to be very unlikely. Deakin&apos;s concerns over Boris island have contributed to the burying of Johnson&apos;s project. Although Nats is not at the forefront of the capacity debate, its advice is vital because those extra flights need to be placed somewhere over England&apos;s crowded skies. Deakin has argued before that the so-called Boris Island airport is the worst option because it will create airborne snarl-ups with planes bound for Schiphol and other London airports. Nonetheless, Deakin says anything is possible technically. &quot;We can add a hub or extra capacity anywhere.&quot; He has also laid down the gauntlet to airlines and Nats&apos; regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, over this month&apos;s disruption. If airlines want to prevent one-off system glitches they will have to help fund the cost of installing extra safeguards and the CAA will need to make a judgment on how much is enough, he says. &quot;Our back-up system delivered 90% capacity so the longer-term question is if 90% wasn&apos;t enough, what is and how will that be funded?&quot; Nats was established in 1962 as National Air Traffic Control Services to control Britain&apos;s civil flights and has been one of the state&apos;s more successful privatisations, barring the odd system failure like this month&apos;s stumble. The government partly privatised the company in 2000, selling 46% to a group of airlines, giving staff a 5% stake and keeping 49%. Heathrow now owns a 4% piece of the airlines&apos; original stake. Nats handles 2.1m flights and 220 million passengers in UK airspace each year. Last year, the average delay per flight was 1.4 seconds \u2013 4% of the European average and down from 130 seconds 10 years ago. Nats will have a new shareholder when the Universities Superannuation Scheme&apos;s purchase of half of the Airline Group shareholding completes early next year. The deal will give the pension fund a 21% indirect stake in Nats and Deakin says it is keen for the company to grow. Last year the company made a pre-tax profit of \u00a3190.7m and international operations make up a growing share of Nats&apos; activities. In 2000, Nats&apos; only operation outside the UK was in Gibraltar but now it sells air traffic control, technology and advice in more than 30 countries. The Middle East and Asia are top of Deakin&apos;s list target markets. His latest deal is working with Rolls-Royce and Qatar Airways to increase the airline&apos;s efficiency when flying Airbuses in and out of Doha airport, saving fuel and money. &quot;It&apos;s something we proposed to Qatar Airways. The worst contract you can do is where you compete against the world. One of the key challenges is putting bodies on the ground. We&apos;re increasingly putting offices into the Middle East, India, Singapore, Hong Kong and other markets to build relationships. We try to avoid just responding to requests for information,&quot; he says. &quot;Asia-Pacific is a huge growth area. It feels as though things haven&apos;t slowed down there even during the recession. Every month in China, 240 new civil aircraft are registered. Can you believe that?&quot; The new year should bring big opportunities for Deakin. But for now there is the small matter of getting a few million people off the tarmac and to their destinations without further technical failure."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/dec/24/international-students-christmas", "sentences": ["I&apos;m excited to eat Christmas foods I haven&apos;t eaten before, and take part in traditions that you simply can&apos;t find in Singapore.&quot; Hong says it can be hard for some international students to be away from family at Christmas, but that he is choosing to be positive about the situation."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-24T12:52:47Z", "title": "International students: how are you celebrating Christmas?", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Education", "International students", "Christmas"], "article": "Driving Home for Christmas is the one song guaranteed to make me well up at Christmas. All those adverts of families coming together around the dinner table make me miss my family to the point of sappiness \u2013 and they only live two hours away on the train. So what&apos;s it like to be an international student if you can&apos;t get home for Christmas \u2013 celebrating in a foreign country away from your family? &quot;It&apos;s hard,&quot; says Kristina Janovcikova, a fourth-year journalism and French student at the University of Sheffield, whose family live in Slovakia. &quot;I often find myself looking into people&apos;s windows on my way home, envious that they get to watch TV with their families, all cosied up.&quot; Katie Kokkinou, welfare and international officer at University College London, says that Christmas can be difficult for many international students, as unis often freeze services over the break. She says: &quot;Usually everything is closed for a significant stretch of time, but many students are still here. Some students don&apos;t want to go back and prefer to revise instead, while others simply cannot afford to, because flights during winter are so expensive. And others do part-time work.&quot; Getting home can be just too expensive when home is the other side of the world. Wissam Chauhan, a third-year networked systems engineering student at Glasgow Caledonian University, says: &quot;I am originally from Pakistan but was raised in Saudi Arabia. It takes me a whole day of travelling to go to Saudi Arabia and I can&apos;t afford to pay more than \u00a31000 and just be there for 10 days. &quot;It&apos;s hard being away from your family. I will miss them more in these holidays because my university will be closed and I will be at home most of the time. You get homesick.&quot; Instead of going home for Christmas, Chauhan will be using the break to revise and make the most of the cold weather &quot;that I don&apos;t get in my country&quot;. Many universities put on activities for students over the Christmas break, like Durham&apos;s annual Christmas dinner in Durham castle and Kingston&apos;s carol service and festive dinner. At the University of Hertfordshire, the dean of students&apos; team visit all students who stay in halls over the holidays to give out small presents. But lots of students make their own plans for the break. If you can&apos;t get to your own family this Christmas, joining another family for their celebrations could be a happy alternative. Karla Mormoreira, a final-year law student at Cardiff whose family lives in Canada, says: &quot;I&apos;m spending Christmas at a friend&apos;s house. Her family invited me for Christmas there \u2013 it&apos;ll be like having a surrogate family.&quot; Mormoreira had the choice between going home for Christmas, or joining her family on holiday in February. She says: &quot;I chose to join our family vacation in South America, where we&apos;re originally from, rather than going home for Christmas. I felt I&apos;d be having more of an experience going away.&quot; This will be Mormoreira&apos;s first Christmas without any family members. &quot;It is kind of lonely, but the fact that I&apos;ve been invited to spend it with my housemate is really nice.&quot; But some students are choosing to forgo family festivities altogether. When Janovcikova realised she wouldn&apos;t be able to get home to Slovakia for the holiday, she decided to do something completely different and volunteer at a homeless shelter on Christmas Day. &quot;I requested to work on Christmas Day because I thought it was a nice thing to do,&quot; she says. &quot;Lots of the homeless people might not have a family to spend Christmas Day with so it can be lonely for them.&quot; Once she has finished at the homeless shelter, Janovcikova will be celebrating with some English friends who are staying in Sheffield because of work commitments. But the Christmas celebrations will be somewhat different to her traditional Christmas at home. &quot;In Slovakia we have a traditional Christmas meal consisting of fish, potato salad and sauerkraut soup. It&apos;s also different because instead of opening presents in the morning we give out presents after dinner.&quot; Christmas in the UK brings new traditions to many students. Jose Hong, a second-year European social and political studies student at University College London, says: &quot;I don&apos;t actually feel like I&apos;m missing that much. I&apos;m excited to eat Christmas foods I haven&apos;t eaten before, and take part in traditions that you simply can&apos;t find in Singapore.&quot; Hong says it can be hard for some international students to be away from family at Christmas, but that he is choosing to be positive about the situation. &quot;If Christmas is all about spending time with family for you, then it&apos;s natural that having a lonely Christmas will be hard. If, however, you take the opportunity to explore a totally different way of celebrating such a notable holiday, especially with the knowledge that you won&apos;t have many chances to do so once you return to your home country, then it makes celebrating Christmas in a foreign country much easier \u2013 and much more exciting and enjoyable.&quot; For others, celebrating Christmas at all is unusual. Victoria Ngow, whose family live in Malaysia, says: &quot;I personally don&apos;t celebrate Christmas.&quot; Last year, instead of going home, Ngow spent the holiday with her friends. She says: &quot;There were three of us, so we watched movies, painted our nails and ate cookies. On Boxing Day we fought the crowds and went shopping and then in the days that followed we did touristy things around London. &quot;I think we do miss our family and the traditions at home, but we&apos;ve formed our little &apos;family&apos; here whom we&apos;ve grown comfortable with, and we spend the holidays together.&quot; But if you&apos;re a new student who has struggled to settle in during your first term, then Christmas can be a difficult time of year. Khasan Abbas, who grew up in Abu Dhabi and now studies engineering in Cardiff, says that Christmas last year was &quot;quite boring&quot;. He says: &quot;As a first year I didn&apos;t know many people around and spent much of the holidays just walking around Cardiff.&quot; This year Abbas is planning a more exciting holiday though, travelling between UK cities and possibly abroad. Abbas suggests that international students try to go home in their first year to visit family: &quot;I would strongly recommend international students in their first year to go home during the Christmas holidays so they do not get nostalgic. For most of us, it is the first time living away from home. This is the best time to visit because during the second term studies do get tougher, and there is not much time with all the deadlines and tests. &quot;But if you were to stay, I would suggest keeping yourself busy somehow such as going to see the Christmas markets, or travelling and socialising with friends to avoid feeling lonely.&quot; What are you up to this Christmas?

This was not unusual, but during the ceremony I felt pretty sad and hopeless. It was difficult to quaff champagne and toast our futures when I couldn&apos;t make rent. Plus I was horrifically hungover, thanks to the four-bottles-for-a-tenner wine deal my dad had provided the night before. Although I&apos;m now earning money as a\u00a0freelance writer, at the time it seemed unlikely I would ever make a living from doing what I loved. Almost half of those who have graduated in the last five years in the UK are in non-graduate jobs for which they are overqualified and underpaid. This means the average graduate &quot;starting salary&quot; of \u00a329,000 is a distant dream for many university leavers, as they take anything that&apos;s going in a competitive labour market and render it even more difficult for the less qualified to find work. Fresh out of uni and on benefits, it looked as though I might be another casualty of this &quot;lost generation&quot; that the papers insisted existed. Meanwhile, much like a bothersome fridge, Facebook was an ever-present background hum to my existence, a reminder of the imagined good fortunes of friends and acquaintances. Modern folklore has it that social media has made us unhappy in our constant attempts to compete with our better-off peers, a factor often cited when it comes to the &quot;quarter-life crisis&quot; that supposedly hits around 25. Yet on their careers, my old schoolfriends were unusually silent. No one boasted about big bonuses or promotions, instead focusing their posts on friends, family or, of course, cats. Perhaps, career-wise at least, we were indeed that lost generation. I decided to find out. I chose to focus\u00a0on the sixth-form of my Welsh comprehensive, an above-average secondary school for the area, but not without problems. These were students who had gained the necessary GCSE grades to take A-levels, and all went on\u00a0to university. I knew very little about what most of them had got up to after that \u2026 and nothing had prepared me for\u00a0what I would find out. Sam Elliott, 26 Manchester Metropolitan University, hospitality management with culinary arts (didn&apos;t graduate) Earns: \u00a320,000-25,000 It&apos;s hard to concentrate at uni when you&apos;re working 60-70 hour weeks in a kitchen, so I left to go full time as a chef. I wasn&apos;t nervous about job prospects because there are lots of opportunities for chefs. It&apos;s a shame I left, though, because I\u00a0could have done much more. I&apos;d like to have learned the business side of things, not so much the cooking because there&apos;s only so much they can teach you \u2013 hence so many people learning on the job. I now live in Manchester working at a flagship Marriott hotel, renting a two-bedroom house with my girlfriend and 15-month-old daughter, but we&apos;re looking to move to Singapore in a few years. Or I&apos;d like to start my own business. When my daughter was born, my priorities had to change, and I could no longer do 17-hour days for rubbish pay. Now I do 12-hour days for rubbish pay, plus looking after the coolest child ever. Dr Sarah El-Sheika, 26 Graduated: University of Liverpool, medicine, 2010 Earns: \u00a335,000-40,000 When I graduated I had already been offered a job. I completed a two-year foundation programme, then worked in emergency medicine before applying for\u00a0my current specialty. I work full time (though still training through my\u00a0job) and own my own flat. I would definitely do my degree again. I love my work and I have relatively good job security. I was fortunate to have been in the last year before top-up fees, and I feel sorry for the current students who have an increasingly expensive education. I can easily see how leaving with \u00a350,000 debt would put people off. With the changes to the NHS, I and many of my friends are fearful of being unable to get jobs the more senior we become. A few have already left to work abroad. In five years&apos; time I&apos;ll still be working towards becoming a consultant. Or I&apos;ll be lying on a beach in the sunshine with a smile and bottle of rum. Sam Felda, 26 Graduated: Liverpool John Moores in\u00a0French and Spanish, 2009, then Liverpool Hope University (PGCE) Earns: \u00a325,000-30,000 I felt frustrated at my job prospects when I graduated. I had borrowed a lot of money and studied very hard. I was unsatisfied working in jobs I felt overqualified for and that had no relation to my degree, so I retrained. I had considered teaching and had enjoyed jobs where I had worked with young people, so after moving back home to save money I returned to Liverpool to take a PGCE. This was just before tuition fees reached a maximum of \u00a39,000 \u2013 I\u00a0very much doubt I could have afforded the course under these circumstances. There were 30 language-trained teachers in our class alone, and many of us were going for the same posts. Luckily I found a job (I teach languages in a secondary school), as did most of my class. I see friends of mine recently out of university struggling to find graduate schemes, permanent jobs or anything beyond zero-hour contracts. My degree has been vital to my job, but it saddens me to say that, were I 18 again, I wouldn&apos;t choose the subject about which I felt passionate \u2013 I&apos;d make my choice based on job opportunities and pay.     Sharmin Shultan, scientist; and Kirsten Bone, social worker    Sharmin Shultan, 26 Graduated: University of Manchester, biomedical sciences, 2008 Earns: \u00a325,000-30,000 As I graduated there were lots of gloomy stories about job losses, so I was slightly apprehensive. I applied for jobs in Manchester but had no response, so I\u00a0came back to Wales and started a part-time job as a sales assistant in Debenhams. After six months I heard about a job at Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics from a friend and sent in my CV. I was offered a job as a lab technician earning \u00a310,00-\u00a315,000. Five years on, having worked in various different roles, I am a\u00a0scientist. My degree was definitely useful as it gave me experience of working in a laboratory. I still live with my parents, but in five\u00a0years&apos; time I hope to have bought my own house. Kirsten Bone, 26 Graduated: University of Liverpool,\u00a0human anatomy and cell\u00a0biology,\u00a02008 Earns: \u00a320,000-25,000 I wasn&apos;t really nervous about graduating into the recession; I was probably naive as I had been on track for a first, so was pretty hopeful I&apos;d be OK job-wise. I&apos;ve realised since that having a first doesn&apos;t count for much. I decided I was going to do post-grad medicine, so I moved back to Wales to live rent-free while I got some work experience in a doctor&apos;s surgery. By February I was going mad living with my\u00a0parents, so decided to move down to London. I applied for an MI5 job, half as a joke, and got to the fourth recruitment round before being rejected, so I went for a graduate sales role instead. I did a half-arsed medicine application thinking that, with the first and my experience, I&apos;d get a few interviews. I wasn&apos;t successful. I felt I was back to square one, so I freaked out and cut my hair short. I quit the sales job and got a receptionist role in a fertility clinic. Working there made me think about training in that area. I settled on social work as there was a bursary. After doing the required work experience, I applied for a\u00a0social work course. I got a place and graduated this year. I&apos;m now in a shared house while working in a fostering and adoption team. I love it. I think I needed to go the long way round in order to have time to realise what it was I wanted to do.     Left to right: Jacob Taylor, bar manager; Max Hunter, student; and Lisa Williams, assistant manager at McDonald's    Jacob Taylor, 26 Graduated: University of Manchester, social anthropology, 2009 Earns:\u00a0Around Aus $60K (approx \u00a335,000; it&apos;s all relative though \u2013 the\u00a0cost of living here is high) You can&apos;t really avoid a global recession without heading off to Mars, but you can bugger off from the Tories by leaving the country. As for job prospects, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had been incredibly stimulated by my degree, but I had also been in full-time education since I was three years old. More than anything I wanted a break. I quickly learned it was &quot;who you know, not what you know&quot; that matters \u2013 I landed a job doing customer service in the same office as my brother. I used the money to move to Australia, where I\u00a0intended to travel and work casually, while plotting my next career move. After a stopover in Thailand I moved to Melbourne. I intended on just passing through but got a job in a cocktail bar, found I was pretty good at it, and moved\u00a0up the chain. I&apos;m now managing a successful, high-end cocktail bar. It&apos;s not what I want to do for ever \u2013 I am saving up for further study in anthropology \u2013 but it&apos;s fun. Max Hunter, 26 Graduated: University of Manchester, Management and Leisure, 2009 Earning: N/A To be honest, what I would do after graduation wasn&apos;t really on my mind while studying. I had more pressing concerns, like worrying about how to afford a 3L bottle of Strongbow. After looking at my eight-hour-a-week timetable, I realised I was on a Mickey Mouse course, but figured I&apos;d land on my feet. After I graduated I spent the summer trying to find work, failed, and ended up moving back home. Over three years I\u00a0drifted between jobs \u2013 bar and bank work, door-to-door sales, working in a car warranty call centre, dressing up as a superhero in a homeware store, and in a payday loan/pawnbroking store. In 2012 I realised I was going nowhere. As health and fitness interested me, I looked into a career as a physio. The high employment rate and option to be self-employed were appealing. I spent the next year gaining work experience and returned to college to get the A-level I needed to\u00a0apply for the course, while working evenings at a call centre. I&apos;m currently a\u00a0first-year physiotherapy student at Sheffield Hallam University. My first degree was a waste of time. I\u00a0wasn&apos;t one of those kids who always knew what they wanted to do; I fell into university because all my friends were going. It was fun, but we all knew the course was a joke. If I had my time again, I would take a year out to learn more about what I was interested in, and to decide whether uni was the best option. Lisa Williams, 26 Graduated: Bangor University, Business and Marketing BA 2009, MA 2010 Earns: \u00a319,000 I was nervous about graduating into the recession, which is why I did a masters for an extra year. I thought if I stayed in education then perhaps the situation might be better once I emerged. My degree has been useful as I have been able to fast-track through McDonald&apos;s \u2013 I&apos;m now an assistant manager there. I lived at home while I was studying but I&apos;m renting at the moment, though I&apos;d like to be able to buy in future. I have a daughter who is 10 months old.     Kiri Pritchard-Mclean (middle), comedy producer; and Huw Westmoreland, engineer    Kiri Pritchard-Mclean, 27 Graduated: University of Salford, contemporary theatre practice, 2009 Earns: \u00a310,000-\u00a315,000 I&apos;ve always prided myself on my work ethic, having worked since I was 14 in multiple jobs. I remember being halfway through my degree and calling my tutor in my summer job chef&apos;s whites to tell her I was dropping out. But I didn&apos;t. Post-graduation, I had a soul-destroying retail job. I was the unhappiest I have ever been, and overdrawn. In the new year of 2010 I\u00a0decided I&apos;d hand my notice in and go\u00a0from there. I knew I\u00a0wanted to do standup comedy, but was so exhausted and miserable I didn&apos;t have the time or energy to pursue it. The start of 2010 was really tough \u2013 21p noodles from Home Bargain got me through, but then I saw an admin job in\u00a0a comedy club, applied, got it and haven&apos;t looked back. I now work as a live\u00a0comedy producer of day and I gig at\u00a0night. I live in Manchester and bought a house last year, renovating and living in it. I&apos;ve learned I&apos;m a dab hand with a belt sander. I&apos;m going to go full-time as a\u00a0standup in the new year. I&apos;m well aware my degree falls into the Mickey Mouse category of higher education, so often held up as an example of why so many young people are out of work. It&apos;s not fair and not the case. Huw Westmoreland, 26 Graduated: University of Manchester, MEng aerospace engineering with\u00a0management Earns: \u00a340k + Having completed a three-month placement at Jaguar Land Rover between my third and fourth years, I got a position on the graduate scheme. I started back in the same department and on my\u00a0return was immediately made one of\u00a0the cooling systems engineers for the New Range Rover &amp; Range Rover Sport. Last year I moved to my current position as one of the powertrain project leaders for Land Rover. I now own a\u00a0house in Leamington Spa. Without my degree, I wouldn&apos;t have been able to get to where I am today, so it has been very useful. In five years&apos; time I\u00a0hope to have progressed to management level."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/dec/28/railway-mans-forgotten-family", "sentences": ["Less than a year later, he was captured by the Japanese after the surrender of Singapore \u2013 and for the next three and a half years Nan waited, not knowing if he was alive or dead."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-28T07:10:00Z", "title": "The Railway Man's forgotten family: 'We were victims of torture too'", "tags": ["Family", "Parents and parenting", "Life and style", "Second world war", "The Railway Man"], "article": "Watch The Railway Man, which goes on general release in the new year, and you&apos;ll leave the cinema feeling you know all about the complicated, scarred individual at its centre: Eric Lomax, who was tortured by the Japanese during the second world war and eventually rescued from his torment through the love of his wife Patti. But there are three names you won&apos;t hear during the film: those of Nan, Eric&apos;s first wife, and Linda and Charmaine, his daughters. The four of them were a family for 37 years yet they are completely missing from the film, which stars Colin Firth, Jeremy Irvine and Nicole Kidman. Today Nan and Linda are dead, and Eric himself died last year. So when Charmaine attended the film premiere in London earlier this month, she noticed a few puzzled looks when she told people she was Eric&apos;s daughter. &quot;I could see them thinking, where do you fit into all this?&quot; she says. Charmaine wasn&apos;t sure whether she wanted to tell the story of how she fitted in, the story that is missing from the film of her father&apos;s life and yet integral to it. But seeing The Railway Man has prompted her to do so because, watching it, she felt as though the final piece of her lifelong mission to understand her father was being slotted into place. &quot;On screen I got to see him as a young man \u2013 as he was before I met him, as he was even before he married my mum,&quot; she says. &quot;Jeremy Irvine is so like my dad it&apos;s uncanny. What I saw for the first time was the man Dad should have been, the man he would have been if he hadn&apos;t suffered in the terrible way that he did.&quot; That understanding has meant the end of a long journey to forgive her father. That is an extraordinary feat, because the truth is that Charmaine, Linda and Nan were victims of torture just as Eric was. But while he was the victim of appalling physical torture (in Burma he was waterboarded daily and kept at the point of death for weeks), his family were tortured secondhand, for decades, because of what it did to him and to their relationship. For Charmaine, growing up, one phrase continually cropped up. &quot;I was forever being told, &apos;Your dad was tortured&apos;,&quot; she recalls. &quot;But no one ever explained what tortured meant.&quot; The truth was that only Eric knew; and the only way he could survive was by burying it so deeply inside himself that he couldn&apos;t communicate anything. &quot;He had this armour and you could never get beneath it to find out what was really going on,&quot; she says. &quot;My dad&apos;s feelings were locked inside himself. He was there physically, but emotionally he was 100% absent,&quot; says Charmaine. Eric was 20 when he joined the Royal Signals Corps and went, in 1941, to south-east Asia. In the months before he left, he&apos;d been courting Nan in their native Edinburgh and on the eve of his departure they got engaged. Less than a year later, he was captured by the Japanese after the surrender of Singapore \u2013 and for the next three and a half years Nan waited, not knowing if he was alive or dead. Eric, meanwhile, had been force-marched along with other British, Australian, Indian and Malay prisoners to the infamous concentration camp at Changi. Subsequently he was sent to Burma to work on the railway to Siam (now Thailand). Some of the prisoners built their own radio which they used to follow the progress of the war. But in August 1943 they were caught; 10 men were arrested, severely beaten (two died) and moved to a special prison for prolonged torture \u2013 Eric was one of them. Incredibly, he survived until the end of the war. One night in 1945, Nan, a devout Christian, had a dream in which she saw Eric emerging from a bright light. When she woke up, she felt certain that he would come home. A few months later, he did. They might have waited to get married but while Eric was a prisoner of war, his mother died. His father had remarried. &quot;Dad had nowhere to stay, so he moved in with my mum and her parents,&quot; says Charmaine. Today, every professional he&apos;d have encountered once he was home would have urged him not to rush into anything after his experience in captivity. But this was 1945. An army doctor checked his vital signs and told him to get on with his life. Three weeks later, Eric and Nan were married. &quot;My mum told me that on their first night together she rubbed cream into the sores on Dad&apos;s back and asked him what had happened,&quot; says Charmaine. &quot;He said he didn&apos;t want to talk about it and that she should never ask him again.&quot; Nan never did ask again: Charmaine thinks she was too afraid. So they papered over what was a dark, fathomless chasm in their marriage and pretended all was well. A year later, Linda was born. Then Eric, who now worked for the Colonial Office, was posted to west Africa to help build a 600-mile railway across what is now Ghana. While they were there, a second child arrived, a boy who lived for four hours. It was only 40 years later, in 1995, when the autobiography on which the film is based was published, that Nan and Charmaine learned from the dedication that Eric had named his dead son after himself. That spoke volumes, about the emotion locked inside the former soldier and about the complete lack of communication between Eric and Nan. More telling was that in the book Nan and Charmaine were \u2013 in their view \u2013 airbrushed out of his life, with Nan referred to merely as &quot;S&quot;. Consequently, neither Nan nor Charmaine ever did more than dip into the book and never found out the details of his torture. Indeed, even today Charmaine says she doesn&apos;t think she could read the details, and she could barely watch the scenes in the film that show how he was treated. The Lomaxes returned from Africa in 1955, and Charmaine was born two years later. They lived in Edinburgh and Eric worked as a lecturer at Strathclyde University. But the chasm in the marriage was too big and too deep, to be ignored. Eric spent unexplained time away from the family and was unable to deal with ordinary life, especially the bills. As Nan struggled to hold everything together, the bailiffs were knocking at the door. Meanwhile, another blow landed when Linda had a brain haemorrhage at the age of 15 \u2013 she recovered, although the condition that caused it did eventually kill her.     Eric Lomax in Berwick-upon-Tweed in northern England    By the time Charmaine left home to train as a midwife in Bristol in 1980, she suspected her parents&apos; marriage wouldn&apos;t survive. But Nan was devastated when Eric met Patti and left to be with her a few months later. After Eric left, Charmaine and Linda cut off contact with him. &quot;It was hard, but we wanted to concentrate on our mum. Dad had made life very tough for her: Mum deserved better.&quot; It wasn&apos;t until Linda died in 1993, at the age of 46, that Charmaine saw Eric again. &quot;I stood at my sister&apos;s graveside with my mum on one side and my dad on the other,&quot; she remembers. &quot;Afterwards, he asked if I&apos;d meet him sometimes for a cup of tea. So I did, every 18 months or so, although it was often very difficult and we hardly knew what to say to one another.&quot; Part of the fallout from her parents&apos; marriage was that Charmaine vowed never to marry. Instead, she devoted herself to her mother&apos;s needs. &quot;I felt my dad hadn&apos;t cared for her properly, so I wanted to do that,&quot; she says. Nan died in 2003. &quot;After that there was just me and Dad alive. He was living in Berwick and I&apos;d drive down to see him a few times a year. It was never easy because he still never talked about his feelings, but at least we were in touch.&quot; Eric died at the age of 93.     Charmaine with Eric's second wife, Patti, at the London premiere of The Railway Man. Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images Europe    Today Charmaine is 56. Though she swore she&apos;d never marry, in 2007 she did. Being courageous enough to embark on a new life with her husband, Henry, is, she says, proof that she, just like Eric in the film, has emerged from the black cloud of torture that engulfed so much of her life. Her strong Christian faith, and counselling, have helped her to move on: now she means to make the most of the years ahead. The film has brought her a new friend in its screenwriter, Frank Cottrell Boyce, who spent a lot of time with Eric while he was putting the script together. &quot;What Frank has told me has helped me understand my father&apos;s perspective and his experience,&quot; she says. She doesn&apos;t blame Cottrell Boyce for leaving her and Linda and Nan out of the script: it was her father, she says, who left them out of his book. &quot;But we were always there. What happened to him happened to us, too.&quot; The Railway Man opens on 10 January "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/dec/29/bending-adversity-david-pilling-review", "sentences": ["This in turn made it harder to discuss the terrible actions of Japanese forces in China, Singapore and elsewhere."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-29T00:05:00Z", "title": "Bending Adversity by David Pilling \u2013 review", "tags": ["History", "Society", "Books", "Culture", "Fukushima", "Japan", "World news"], "article": "Is Japan the most culturally specific country on Earth? Each time I go there I marvel at the eccentricities: the taxi and bus drivers with their gloves, the ritual of the onsen bath house and the incessant bowing. Nowhere else induces in me such feelings of amused amazement. David Pilling is an Anglo expert on Japan. Some might say that&apos;s an oxymoron, but he is at least one of those foreign correspondents who doesn&apos;t have to try very hard to show his knowledge. He spent most of the first decade of the 21st century based in Tokyo and went back to cover the aftermath of the 2011 earthquake. The result is an authoritative and entertaining attempt to explain the mysteries of the shimaguni, the island nation, and its centuries-old determination to withstand outside influences. The story begins and ends with the disaster that struck the coastal city of Sendai and destroyed the Fukushima nuclear station, with consequences for hundreds of miles around. The author points to systemic failures in the nuclear industry, a combination of the use of casual labour and a management culture that encouraged unquestioning loyalty over robust risk-assessment. Some still struggle to take in the idea that Japan could be anything but efficient. But Pilling helps to explain the extent to which a business model that served the country so well during the great recovery after the second world war has also been at the heart of its more recent economic stagnation. The postwar Japanese company was modelled as a social organisation and most continue to be this to this day. Teams of graduates are recruited each year on the assumption that they will stay with the same firm until retirement. It is, the author suggests, a form of indoctrination, turning them into obedient employees. &quot;It was a career escalator determined not by merit but by length of service, a system that encouraged loyalty and co-operation, not a battle among employees to prove who was most worthy of advancement.&quot; For women, the prospect of promotion or even meaningful employment remains slim. Women still single at 25 have long been referred to disparagingly as &quot;Christmas cake&quot;, an item that plummets in value after 25 December. Home and hearth are assumed, the wife to wait quietly each weekday night until the &quot;salary man&quot; gets home after a heavy evening&apos;s drinking. The after-party drink, niji kai, often involves the boss and his team going to a massage parlour, discussing corporate strategy while being entertained carnally by hostesses. This might give a new meaning to the term bonding exercise. Suffice to say, it is not easy, Pilling notes, for female employees to be on the inside track. The author deftly manages the trick of illustrating grand sweep with small anecdote. Thus during the earthquake, the first response in one supermarket of neatly uniformed staff was to use their hands, arms and bodies to prevent bottles of soy sauce and packets of miso soup from toppling to the floor. For months after the quake, the electricity grid in Tokyo was kept low, to prevent blackouts. Office workers might have been sweltering in the summer without air conditioning, but the lavatory seats were still heated. &quot;Where else in the world?&quot; you might well ask. The answer lies in history. For centuries, Japan cut itself off; it was sakoku, a closed country. Another useful word is nihonjinron, the concept of a racially homogenous society. Only two million out of a population of 127m are descended from a different ethnicity, most of them Koreans. This statistic is important when considering Japan&apos;s terrible war record. Pilling points out that Japan received a slight similar to Germany at Versailles. During the Paris peace conference of 1919, Japan pressed for the principle of racial equality to be made part of the founding covenant of the League of Nations. The western powers refused; they had their colonies and had established their control over the world&apos;s natural resources. Their aim was to shut out latecomers. As for Japan&apos;s refusal to face up to its war record, the author says the Americans are partly to blame. In order to re-establish order, US occupying forces restored the power of the emperor. They also imposed strict censorship, to keep discussion of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to a minimum. This in turn made it harder to discuss the terrible actions of Japanese forces in China, Singapore and elsewhere. From the early 1950s until the late 1980s, Japan was the economy to fear. It is easy to forget, however, how dire it looked in 1945. Starving Tokyo residents would clamber on trains to the countryside to forage for food, eating the leaves off potato plants. Girls lined up to sleep with American GIs in return for nylon stockings or canned food. Then it all took off, corporate giants unleashing Honda cars and Sony stereos on a western world that responded in awe and fear. The Japanese scoffed at the &quot;British disease&quot;, feckless and workshy nation, and the &quot;American disease&quot;, a society riddled with violent crime, drugs and divorce. In the mid-80s, hubris reached a peak. Some of the stories might have been apocryphal, but in this land of the high yen, restaurant diners would sprinkle gold leaf on their food like salt and pepper. Then came the slowdown, years of no growth or slow growth. Korea overtook Japan with its cool tech products; China usurped it with its global power and influence. So what is left? The notion of Japan in crisis is a strange one. Little of the old confidence remains; a succession of weak and unimaginative governments has made little impact. There is much head scratching about a corporate culture that is long past its sell-by date. Yet this is not a country afflicted by overt poverty or social dislocation. Crime remains extremely low, as do prison rates. Pilling is optimistic about Japan&apos;s future. He puts faith in a younger generation trying to break the shackles and a relatively new and dynamic government under Shinzo Abe. Hopes are high that Abenomics will propel Japan back into sunnier uplands. No matter how speedy or sluggish the growth, the most remarkable aspect of Japan is its refusal to embrace globalisation beyond a veneer of McDonalds and Krispy Kremes (where the queue stretches round the block). Like many uninitiated travellers to the country, I remain enthralled and disconcerted in equal measure. This book makes a good fist of disentangling the curious charms of the Japanese and for helping outsiders to understand them a little better. John Kampfner&apos;s latest book, The Rich: A History, will be published in autumn 2014.

It is disastrous enough applied to rich people, leading to an overestimation of their intelligence that is both tragic and comic. Applied to poor people it feeds other, harsher attitudes about social security and safety nets, what our responsibilities are to one another and whether we resent them or feel OK about them. It does appear that the UK, though, unlike the US, has a natural point of retreat: when everybody sees their incomes fall and gets just poor enough to realise that it&apos;s systemic, and has nothing to do with how much effort they put in. At that point, generosity of attitude re-establishes itself, and people start ticking &quot;disagree strongly&quot; to Ipsos Mori statements like &quot;I think the unemployed should just look harder for work&quot;. So my hope for 2014 is not for national poverty as such \u2013 rather, the re-establishment of the principles and ambitions of social justice, which have been at the wellspring of everything the country has ever done that had any meaning or value. I would like to see 2014 choreographed by Danny Boyle, in other words. And many of the years after that. Patrick Barkham: &apos;A piece of land not fracked, a badger not culled&apos;      Nature is uplifting and exhilarating, and yet writing about it is often a gloomy business of confronting the ways in which we are consuming and despoiling it. Each year brings small spits in the wind \u2013 a clean energy advance here, a new nature reserve there \u2013 but these gobbets of good news are blown away by the logic of global capitalism: nature is a finite public resource to be annexed by private individuals for short-term profit. After a 2013 of &quot;green crap&quot;, species loss and ever-rising exploitation, a realist might wish for 2014 to be a bit less bad. But I would love to see just one glorious occasion where people choose nature over profit \u2013 a piece of ground not fracked, a runway not built, a badger not culled. A few such exercises of gentle restraint and voices in mainstream politics and the media may belatedly begin questioning our society&apos;s crazy fixation on economic growth as the source of all wellbeing and happiness. Reframing this miserable, myopic vision is too much to ask for 2014. It&apos;s probably too much to ask for 2041. But it&apos;s never too early to start trying. Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett: &apos;An end to online hate&apos;      The wish closest to my heart would be to see an end to the sweeping cuts being made to disability benefits. These cuts are affecting disabled people and their families in heartbreaking and often tragic ways. Our government should be ashamed. It should also go without saying that I&apos;d like to live in a kinder, more accepting society that treats individuals as human beings, whether it&apos;s allowing women to be fully clothed in music videos, refusing to stigmatise those on benefits or giving those with no quality of life the right to die.  As I&apos;m not going to get that, however, I&apos;d settle for people being nicer to one another on the internet. My general rule is, if you wouldn&apos;t have the guts to walk up to someone in a room and say it, then don&apos;t say it online. From revenge porn to threats of violence against women to slut-shaming to feminists trashing each other, I&apos;d like 2014 to be the year that people close their laptops instead of being nasty \u2013 and realise that very little of significance ever happens on Twitter. Aditya Chakrabortty: &apos;Policy on real benefit scroungers \u2013 employers&apos;      I kept running into a type in 2013: the impoverished worker, on wages too low to keep them afloat. University cleaners doing two or three jobs a day, or staff at high street banks forced to turn to payday lenders. And they told stories of colleagues who were worse off, begging from foodbanks. Impoverished workers are fast becoming the norm. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 2013 was the first year that the majority of people in poverty were from working families. Something remarkable has happened in Britain. Employers are getting into the habit of giving their staff poverty pay \u2013 and leaving the government to top it up with benefits. British taxpayers are ultimately handing cash to miserly bosses. More effectively than any other contemporary figure, the impoverished worker punctures what the Westminster set thinks it knows about the jobs market. From New Labour workfare to Iain Duncan Smith and George Osborne: for decades, the main parties have hammered the unemployed. But they won&apos;t face down firms who don&apos;t pay enough to live on. Ed Miliband so badly wants bosses to give the living wage that he&apos;s promised tax breaks to those who comply; in other words, a Labour government would continue to subsidise Scrooge employers. But we won&apos;t tackle poverty pay until we tackle the massive inequality of which it is part. Look at Lloyds Banking Group, which racked up \u00a31.7bn pre-tax profits in the first nine months of this year. In 2012 its chief executive, Ant\u00f3nio Horta-Os\u00f3rio, took \u00a33.4m in cash, pension and perks. Yet 45% of his staff are on two salary bands that begin at \u00a313,000 and \u00a317,000 respectively. Unsurprisingly, most of them say they can&apos;t manage financially. So that&apos;s my hope for this year: that the politicians start talking about a different kind of benefits scrounger \u2013 the corporations who pay their staff misery wages, and expect the welfare state to step in. Lola Okolosie: &apos;Education policy made by teachers&apos;      I have one wish for 2014 \u2013 that the majority of those responsible for producing countless educational policies have at least two years&apos; experience teaching at the chalkface. This is the case in Singapore, a country whose achievements we are repeatedly told to emulate; 2012 saw it come second in a rank of countries comparing maths, reading and science results. And if, as I suspect, that wish appears fantastical, I&apos;ll settle for something much more realistic \u2013 that teachers have more say in the policies that will affect us. A much closer interaction between educators and policy makers, one that does not merely pay lip service to teachers&apos; ideas, would perhaps have saved us from the numerous policy rewrites and U-turns we have seen over the last year. The embarrassing debacle of the policy adviser appointed headteacher of a free school without a teaching qualification who then resigned after a few weeks teaches us one thing: working in a thinktank on education does not mean you understand how things actually work in the classroom. Jonathan Freedland: &apos;A breakthrough in Israel-Palestine talks&apos;      One of the unexpected breakthroughs of 2013 was the interim \u2013 and far from complete \u2013 deal struck between the world&apos;s leading powers and Iran over the latter&apos;s nuclear programme. My fond hope for 2014 is that the US secretary of state, John Kerry, will reach another breakthrough in an area which is, if anything, even more intractable: the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. I say &quot;fond&quot; because the grounds for pessimism do not need spelling out. Both peoples are led by men who could hardly be described as visionaries for peace and who are, besides, badly boxed in: Mahmoud Abbas&apos;s writ does not run in Gaza, Binyamin Netanyahu presides over a coalition dominated by hawks ready to oppose the first sign of compromise. It&apos;s long been said that the most Israel could offer falls short of the least the Palestinians could accept. Unsurprisingly, the word that hovers around the Kerry talks is &quot;stalemate&quot;. And yet the process is not over. Leaks have been intriguingly few, which suggests seriousness. Above all, Kerry is stubbornly committed to it, devoting more hours to face-to-face contact with the antagonists than any recent predecessor. He clearly believes he is not wasting his time and that some kind of breakthrough is possible. Let&apos;s hope that 2014 proves him right.  Polly Toynbee: &apos;The sudden shaming of this government&apos;      The best hope for this year is the sudden shaming of this government and the unravelling of its plans. Let&apos;s hope that more eyes open to the fact that deficit reduction at this ruthless rate never was a fiscal necessity, but a gleeful Tory opportunity to diminish the public realm and shrink the state. The result has been services slashed and benefit cuts that reverse decades of social progress. Let this be the year Duncan Smith&apos;s &quot;scrounger&quot; attacks rebound on him. The independent Institute for Fiscal Studies shows government plans for the years after 2015 would require yet deeper cuts, devastating the NHS. So far, many voters seem to believe the propaganda that deficit-cutting is worth the sacrifice, though economic growth has been sluggish and deficit-reduction delayed. As foodbank queues grow, let this be the year when most people start asking why the highest price is extracted from the lowest-paid half of the population, their incomes falling while the proceeds of growth only flow to the better off. Let this be the year scales fall from the eyes and a majority see beyond doubt that we were never all in this together."}]}
