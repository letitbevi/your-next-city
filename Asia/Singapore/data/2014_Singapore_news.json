But the 1986-1987 cabinet papers reveal that the reformist process was slow and difficult. The government had to deal constantly with unions, businesses and interest groups who sought to undermine reform in key areas such as industry assistance and industrial relations. The major industry assistance at the time was tariffs. In December 1986 the cabinet considered a general reduction of tariffs but rejected this, as, the minister for industry John Button noted, such a move would inevitably draw comparisons with the 25% across-the-board tariff cut implemented by the Whitlam government. Button\u2019s submission referred to this as the \u201c1973 experience\u201d. For a Labor government desperate to never appear like the Whitlam government, this argument ensured that a general economy-wide tariff cut would not occur. But the desire for reform of industry protection remained and the textiles industry, which at the time was the most protected industry, was the focus of cabinet deliberations across 1986 and 1987. In October 1986 cabinet agreed that a new plan for the industry \u201cmust achieve substantial reductions in the level of barrier assistance\u201d. While noting that the industry could generally be \u201ccharacterised by inadequate management, a narrow domestic focus, a low technological base and a poorly educated workforce\u201d, cabinet also noted that \u201cnearly two thirds of the workforce are females and 47% of the total workforce are migrants\u201d. The Industries Assistance Commission recommended phasing down tariff protection for the entire industry to a 50% tariff by 1996. The unions and manufacturers at the time argued for 75%, but this was dismissed by cabinet as it \u201cwould not represent a substantial reduction in assistance\u201d. The cabinet agreed in November 1987 to a reduction to a 60% tariff for clothing and 50% for footwear. And in a move familiar to that recently undertaken for Holden workers, the government also agreed for up to $200m to be provided for \u201cappropriate industry, labour and regional adjustment programs\u201d. Industrial relations in 1986 and 1987 remained strongly centralised. But there were the seeds being sown by Treasurer Paul Keating towards a more decentralised enterprise-based system. In his November 1986 cabinet submission on the Mark III version of the Prices and Incomes Accord, Keating argued for a \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d wage system with a flat increase for all and a second capped increase based on productivity improvements. Within this fixed system the logic of a need to move to a more flexible system was apparent. Keating\u2019s own submission noted that the second tier \u201cmust allow a reasonable range of outcomes, which can afford some flexibility at the industry/enterprise level\u201d. The importance of reforming industrial relations in order to improve productivity became more and more clear to the government during these two years. In June 1986 cabinet noted that \u201cproductivity growth is the key to our future social and economic progress\u201d. But one great impediment to improved productivity, especially for an island nation, was the woeful performance of the shipping industry. In February 1986 cabinet was informed that cargo shipping in Australia averaged a three- to four-day turnaround compared with 1.3 days in Japanese ports for the same ships and 8 hours in Singapore ports. The minutes from the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations also noted that on average for each \u201c26 hours for which labour was allocated to a ship only 17 hours were used in loading and discharging\u201d. The rest of time included \u201c4.3 hours in shift changes, 1.8 hours for meetings and stoppages, two hours waiting for labour to board the vessel and 0.7 hours due to smokes and breaks\u201d. Reform of this sector, however, would have to wait till the 1998 waterfront dispute. In December 1986 cabinet also considered a proposal to allow foreign ships to handle some of Australia\u2019s coastal trade. Cabinet, led by transport minister Peter Morris, rejected the proposal mostly due to opposition from the unions. In his submission, Morris noted that a change of policy would require \u201cat least ACTU endorsement\u201d, otherwise \u201cmajor and continuing, sporadic industrial stoppages, which would prejudice both our external and internal trade, is most likely to be the result\u201d. Morris noted he did not \u201cbelieve ACTU endorsement would be forthcoming\u201d. It wasn\u2019t only the unions that put pressure on the government to wind back reforms. In September 1987 the cabinet decided to reinstate the negative gearing tax provisions it had abolished in 1985. The submission notes that abolition of negative gearing was done to \u201cpartially close off a generally recognised tax shelter\u201d and that such a rationale remained \u201cbroadly valid\u201d. In 1985 industry groups had criticised the move, suggesting it would cause rental prices to increase. The September 1987 cabinet submission produced little evidence to suggest this had occurred; indeed it noted that \u201cthe evidence suggests that local influences rather than tax measures dominate in metropolitan markets\u201d. But the lobby groups remained strongly opposed and John Howard had gone to the July 1987 election promising to bring back negative gearing. It\u2019s clear the decision to reinstate the provisions were political rather than economic from the near absence of any economic reasons contained within Treasury\u2019s 1987 cabinet submission. The best it could come up with was to argue the changes had become \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d because when they had been announced in 1985 \u201cit was anticipated that other tax shelters would be closed \u2026 which for various reasons have not been\u201d. The submission also noted that the revenue raised from removing negative gearing had not been as great as expected. Most significantly, the Treasury submission also contained submissions from the premiers of Western Australia and New South Wales claiming the shortage of rental housing in their states was due to the abolition of negative gearing, and from industry associations like the Master Builders Association, the Rental Estate Institute of Australia and the Australian Association of Building Societies all lobbying for the reintroduction of negative gearing. And so the cabinet agreed, showing that then as now that lobbying by powerful interest group is hard for any government, even one as reformist in nature as was the Hawke government of 1986-87, to resist."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/02/chinas-xiaomi-double-smartphone-sales-2014", "sentences": ["Xiaomi is expected to start selling its phones in Singapore later this year."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-02T12:13:02Z", "title": "China's Xiaomi plans to more than double smartphone sales in 2014", "tags": ["Smartphones", "Apple", "Samsung", "China", "World news"], "article": "Chinese budget smartphone maker Xiaomi plans to sell 40m handsets in 2014, more than double the number it sold in 2013, its chairman said on Thursday, reinforcing the company&apos;s ambitions to outsell more expensive offerings from Apple and Samsung Electronics. Shipping that many handsets would put Xiaomi into the world&apos;s top 10 smartphone makers for the first time. Lei Jun, who is also co-founder of the tech firm, made the projection on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s most widely used microblogging site, and it was reposted on Xiaomi&apos;s website. &quot;We again promise, we will at least supply 40m phones in 2014!&quot; he wrote. China is the world&apos;s biggest market for smartphones. Xiaomi&apos;s business model \u2013 offering &quot;flash sales&quot; of its mobile phones which generate excitement among would-be buyers, and have seen thousands sold in seconds \u2013 has led to its rapid rise. In August it tempted Hugo Barra to leave his position as head of the Android team at Google to come and work for the company as its head of global business. Barra later explained that Xiaomi is happy to sell phones essentially at cost, and then to make money from selling services on them, and noted that countries such as India, Russia and Indonesia were &quot;sweet spots&quot; for its business. Xiaomi is expected to start selling its phones in Singapore later this year. Lei said privately that Xiaomi had sold 18.7m smartphones in 2013 \u2013 a 160% increase from 2012 \u2013 and that sales revenues, including taxes, rose 150% to 31.6bn yuan (\u00a33.16bn). Xiaomi&apos;s sales growth far exceeds projections for the global smartphone market, which is expected to expand at an annual rate of 18% a year until 2016, according to research firm Canalys. Overall growth in China is far greater than the world market, because there are more people there who don&apos;t yet have a smartphone, and people tend to replace cheap phones much more quickly \u2013 on average every 13 months, according to data collected by sites there.\u00a0 Xiaomi&apos;s cheap yet sleek phones are popular in China, where Samsung Electronics remains the market leader. Xiaomi&apos;s handsets sell for between \u00a379 and \u00a3248, much lower than the \u00a3447 price tag for the least expensive iPhone 5C model or a Samsung Galaxy Note II, which can retail for \u00a3345. The company even managed to briefly rank sixth by market share in the second quarter of 2013, one notch above Apple. But the launch of the iPhone 5S and 5C in the third quarter propelled Apple to third place there, behind Samsung and Lenovo. Apple is poised to boost its sales in China after it signed a deal last month with China Mobile, the world&apos;s largest mobile carrier by subscriber numbers. The deal could generate $3bn in revenue in 2014 for the U.S. firm."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/02/vincent-tan-malaysian-view", "sentences": ["I was even presented with a shirt by my president in Singapore with my name on the back changed from &apos;Darby&apos; to &apos;Must-win&apos;.&quot; Tan is not involved in football in his homeland, where most clubs are owned by regional state football associations and run by powerful presidents from the business or political world."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-02T13:04:00Z", "title": "Vincent Tan is no pantomime villain according to Malaysian experts | John Duerden", "tags": ["Cardiff City", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Kuala Lumpur in 1975. Arsenal are struggling on a pitch alive with thousands of little frogs jumping around. The heat, humidity and jet lag are not making it any easier. And then there is the legendary Mokhtar Dahari. Super Mokh is tearing the London side apart and scores both Malaysia&apos;s goals in a 2-0 win. Fast forward nearly 40 years and British football is finding another Malaysian, who likes to get his own way, hard to handle. Vincent Tan is the owner of Cardiff City and, over the festive season, has become a pantomime villain in the pages of the British sports press having sacked his popular manager Malky Mackay and replaced him with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. In south-east Asia it is a little different and Peter Butler, the tough-tackling midfielder who was a cult hero among West Ham United fans in the early 90s, has spent the best part of a decade managing in south-east Asia and Malaysia and believes there is more to the Chinese Malay tycoon than his media portrayal in the west suggests. &quot;Vincent Tan and the people around him are not stupid, they are very smart indeed,&quot; says Butler, no apologist for a country in which he is regarded as a talented coach who speaks his mind, even if that sometimes gets him into trouble. In 2012 alone, Butler, as manager of Terengganu, substituted his goalkeeper midway through a game for what he saw as the deliberate conceding of a goal, publicly challenged players to a lie detector test, was banned by the club for six months (later overturned by the Malaysian FA) and called journalists &quot;parasites&quot;. &quot;Cardiff wouldn&apos;t be where they are today if it wasn&apos;t for Tan,&quot; Butler adds. &quot;He has achieved so much. You can&apos;t have it all your own way. If you get foreign investment in clubs, then this is going to happen. Asian owners like Tan are very big on KPIs [key performance indicators], accountability and want to know everything that&apos;s going on and want their say. They want to be part of it.&quot; It is hands on with a leather-gloved grip. Butler claims that interference from above in the region, while varying in degrees, is constant and that developing a relationship with an Asian owner is critical \u2013 something that Steve Kean seemed to realise very quickly when Venky&apos;s took over Blackburn Rovers. &quot;Suddenly you don&apos;t just have 25 players to manage, you have to learn how to manage upwards and that is the most important relationship. Malaysian and Asian football is all about managing relationships and, if you can&apos;t or won&apos;t do that, then you will not last long. I&apos;ve learnt that the hard way. In south-east Asia, finishing a contract is success. There are no rules.&quot; Steve Darby is another well-known English export to the region and in charge of Kelantan, one of Malaysia&apos;s biggest clubs. The Liverpudlian is not surprised by events at Cardiff. &quot;The manner in which Tan is running his club is not so shocking to people here,&quot; says Darby, who is an advocate of Malaysian money being invested in local rather than European football. &quot;I have been lucky. I have had royalty, top CEOs and politicians as presidents of my clubs and they have all let me run the football side without interference.&quot; The genial former goalkeeper has, however, seen other coaches receive instructions during games. &quot;In this part of the world winning is all that matters. I was even presented with a shirt by my president in Singapore with my name on the back changed from &apos;Darby&apos; to &apos;Must-win&apos;.&quot; Tan is not involved in football in his homeland, where most clubs are owned by regional state football associations and run by powerful presidents from the business or political world. Kelantan&apos;s president is Annuar Musa, a well-known politician. The University College London graduate insists that he leaves team affairs to the manager, although he admits that results are all important. He argues that the globalisation of what he calls the EPL \u2013 most Malaysians know it as the BPL \u2013 has introduced a new culture that is bound to come into conflict with the time-honoured way of doing things. &quot;Vincent is a friend of mine, though we never talk about football,&quot; said the former minister for rural development in Malaysia. &quot;I am not sure how much he understands traditional football in the UK but now there are people who invest in the EPL who come from Russia, the United States, the Middle East and now in Asia. All these have slightly different traditions in management and come from different backgrounds and it is natural we can see this in how they run the clubs.&quot; Cardiff&apos;s profile in Malaysia has certainly increased in recent months but still lags way behind those of Manchester United and Liverpool \u2013 the two most popular clubs in the country. Tan and Cardiff is a story but not the biggest \u2013 an A to Z of 2013 sport in one newspaper at the end of the year featured Queens Park Rangers&apos; and Hull&apos;s issues with their owners but there was no mention of goings-on in south Wales. The reporting of the affair is led by the UK media. English language newspapers reprint reports from the Daily Mail or the Sun as well as international news agencies. According to Haresh Deol, editor of the Malay Mail, the situation is not much different in the local language press, especially as Tan has not been doing much talking. &quot;Malay language papers translate what has already been printed by the British press or agencies \u2013 and most of it not being very nice towards Tan,&quot; says Deol. &quot;Thus the fans \u2013 having heavily relied on reports from UK \u2013 have formed the opinion that Tan has not been smart in managing the club, despite having success, and that Tan, instead of Malky Mackay, should have been given the boot.&quot; There has been some debate in the letters pages of newspapers between those arguing Tan is embarrassing the country and those who see no problem with a man who owns the club doing what he wants. A bigger story in the political section has been criticism of the \u00a33m handed over by the Malaysian taxpayer to sponsor Cardiff and publicise the Visit Malaysia 2014 tourism campaign. This was a coup for Tan and down, according to Annuar, to his impressive connections with those in power. The tourism and culture minister, Datuk Seri Nazri Aziz, claimed that the one-season deal would bring a global &quot;publicity and public relations&quot; benefit from the exposure of the Premier League. The English top flight has potent publicity potential but, according to Annuar, Tan is in it for the money. &quot;My impression from conversations with Vincent&apos;s partners is that they thought Cardiff was a good club with a great chance of getting promoted. He has made investments in a wide variety of businesses and going into the EPL is just another investment. He has a good record of success and time will tell if Cardiff is another.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jan/03/hery-rajaonarimampianina-longest-named-leaders-world", "sentences": ["(If you want to know the shortest name, maybe head to Singapore \u2026)       On average heads of state rack up an impressive 14.4 characters \u2013 the top 20 are listed below."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-03T12:13:09Z", "title": "Hery Rajaonarimampianina and the global leaders with the longest names", "tags": ["World news", "Madagascar"], "article": "Former finance minister Hery Rajaonarimampianina has won the run-off presidential election in Madagascar.

At 21, I\u00a0was asking the woman who ran the tripe stall in Leeds Market about the cheapest place to buy tablecloths. There are some superficial differences between us, my father and me. Just surface stuff. Skin deep. While my pink, freckled body is blank and pictureless, my father&apos;s is an ink-splattered historical document. It is a living, stretching archive. I can use my father&apos;s map of tattoos to navigate continents, relationships, families, journeys, marriages and deaths. Talking of journeys, after 28 years in\u00a0Blighty, I have finally decided to renew my New Zealand passport. I am going back to the Land of the Long White Cloud to see the country my father left, for good, more than 30 years ago. But before leaving home, I embarked on another journey, a more emotional journey; a voyage round my father. Using the pinpoints of his ink-injected skin, I wanted to meet my father anew, to fill in the dots of his life story, to discover why he left the home to which I am now returning. He got his first tattoo, a butterfly, in Melbourne after several sweaty months of building railways in the outback. That my father helped build the railways always makes him sound more like some wild-eyed Victorian industrialist than an earring-wearing builder. But, after saving enough money, he headed to Melbourne: &quot;I\u00a0checked myself into a hotel and in one day I bought my first motorbike and got my first tattoo.&quot; The Honda 750 was to &quot;ride around Australia and just end up where I&apos;d end\u00a0up&quot;. The tattoo was picked, on\u00a0the spot, in the shop, after a slightly slurred pep talk from a stranger in a\u00a0bar\u00a0over the road. &quot;I can vaguely remember thumbing through the book.\u00a0I didn&apos;t want anything with words or symbolism. It just felt like a\u00a0classic stamp.&quot; The butterfly, his only coloured tattoo, is also my favourite. Its soft, fuzzy lines reflect the softening and sagging of an arm that once held me above rock pools and carried me up trees. Time has lost its focus on that once broad shoulder and the butterfly is now hazily fading out of view. It was shortly after this that my New\u00a0Zealand grandmother&apos;s cancer crept into her bones, rendering it terminal. My father, a mummy&apos;s boy of\u00a0the highest order, decided to head home to surprise her, but also to say goodbye. &quot;I knew she wouldn&apos;t want me to hang around until she died \u2013 she\u00a0wanted me to carry on my little adventures,&quot; he says. &quot;So I surprised her. She thought I was in Australia and\u00a0I walked in the back door, on her birthday. We had a week, maybe three days, then I went.&quot; During this brief and painful visit, he kept his sleeves rolled down and even covered the photos in his album that showed the tattoo. &quot;I thought it was better not to upset her. She wouldn&apos;t have liked it \u2013 I remember her freaking out when I got my earring at school. I\u00a0went home because I knew it was the last time I&apos;d ever see her, so I didn&apos;t want a confrontation.&quot; So he walked out of that house \u2013 just as he was to walk out of my childhood home and away from my mother 20 years later \u2013 knowing that he would never see its inhabitants again. He waved goodbye to his mother, for ever, to pursue a new love in his life: travel. From building telephone boxes in a\u00a0Sydney factory, he earned enough money to hit the hippy trail. He flew to\u00a0Bali and from there boarded a train through Indonesia, took a boat from Jakarta to Singapore, and then went by buses, hitchhiking and trains up and down Thailand. He flew to Kathmandu, met a &quot;hippy freak&quot; and drove in a van all the way down through India to Goa. Which brings us to the second tattoo. Like so many dropouts before him,\u00a0my father spent his time in Goa running a hamburger bar. I know what you&apos;re thinking \u2013 who runs a burger bar in a Hindu country? Presumably the same sort of person who gets their ankle tattooed by a stranger, in the middle of a dusty market with a needle hitched up to a car battery and no common language. &quot;I was being a hippy on the stoned hippy trail in Goa \u2013 wacko land,&quot; he says. &quot;This was pre-Aids. There was no thought of that. He had a book, and I\u00a0chose this sort of sun thing, with another pattern in the middle. Now it just looks like a franking stamp on my ankle. You could see it because I was walking around with no shoes.&quot; He still walks around with no shoes. And it does look like a passport stamp. But from running this burger bar, my father learned how to cut vegetables \u2013 not pushing down from the top, but slicing at an angle \u2013 which is probably the most, if not the only, useful domestic tip he ever taught me. That and how to push splinters out of your bare feet with a needle. There is a 20-year pause until his next tattoo: during which time he met\u00a0my mother, had me, moved to\u00a0Oxford, became a surveyor, got made redundant, drove taxis and finally became a bicycle-riding barefoot\u00a0builder. After 25 years away from his homeland, Bill finally went on a trip back to New Zealand. With me, my mum and sister in tow, he stopped over on Auckland&apos;s Ponsonby Road to get a\u00a0pseudo-Celtic armband tattooed by my cousin Otis. I\u00a0watched and can still remember his grimace of discomfort as the needle tore into the soft, unmarked skin beside his armpit. My parents were staggeringly incompatible. Plate-smashingly incompatible. Long, screaming arguments into the night incompatible. During their frequent and raging arguments, they threw so much crockery that we were able to make a\u00a0giant mosaic in the garden from the shards. In the year before their truly unexpected wedding, my father actually left, moving out for months into a room in a little shared house 10\u00a0minutes away. They finally separated, three weeks before my A-levels. Just as he had left his mother, standing on her veranda in Hastings, so he left the Victorian brick porch of what I called home, to pursue a new life. Mum and I\u00a0stayed in the house, while he slept on various lonely mattresses in Oxford.     Bill's most recent tattoo. Photograph:  Sarah Lee for the Guardian    It was a horrible time. But one that is for ever marked on his arm. &quot;It&apos;s sort of funny saying it to you, but it was part of leaving your mum,&quot; he says of the black-and-white spiral on his shoulder. &quot;It was a burst out, somehow.&quot; He had, by this point, met his new wife Su, who, like him, loves spirals. His last, most recent tattoo is a huge semi-Aztec band across his calf that he gave himself as a 50th birthday present. He has new daughters now, small, blonde ones, who occasionally colour in this hectic heft of jagged lines. But my days of drawing on to dad&apos;s skin with felt-tip pens are well and truly over. The summer holidays spent colouring in his back are long gone. He is no longer my canvas, but my subject. For, although my father and I are back in touch, years of barely speaking, of disappointment, disaffection, distrust and distance have damaged, perhaps for ever, the playful, pikelet-eating relationship we once had. Yet when I look in the mirror at my towpath-pounding legs, my prominent collarbones, swelling biceps and flat, gravel-hardened feet, I am looking at my father&apos;s body. I can see him, there in my own frame. As he softens into a desk-bound middle age, I am running towards a Bill-shaped future. My New Zealand passport renewed, my ticket booked, I am heading to my fatherland to cycle around a foreign country full of people who share my surname and strange nose. I am returning to where a grandmother I\u00a0never knew waved goodbye to the boy who was to become the man, who was to\u00a0become my father. I&apos;m taking her back the baton. I&apos;m off to have an adventure. And I know that makes him very proud. Hell, maybe I&apos;ll catch a butterfly."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/06/bill-gates-preaches-fighting-poverty-hypocrite-microsoft-tax", "sentences": ["Moving earnings through low corporation tax countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Singapore means the company saved itself, according to one estimate, almost \u00a33bn annually in tax."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-06T07:00:00Z", "title": "Bill Gates preaches the aid gospel, but is he just a hypocrite? | Ian Birrell", "tags": ["Bill Gates", "Microsoft", "Technology", "World news", "Department for International Development (DfID)", "Politics", "US taxation", "US news", "US economy", "Tax avoidance", "Global development", "Aid"], "article": "He made his name as a sharp-elbowed businessman who rode the technology revolution with such style.

He has applauded David Cameron for Britain&apos;s embrace of the target, even condemning a Lords&apos; committee that criticised this cash cascade, while constantly telling other countries to do\u00a0the same. But like those other aid apostles Bono and Bob Geldof, he risks being perceived as a rank hypocrite. For he sees nothing wrong in complex tax avoidance schemes while telling nations how to spend their revenues, notwithstanding the growing body of opinion that aid undermines development and democracy by propping up poorly run regimes. The latest expert to highlight this &quot;aid illusion&quot; is Professor Angus Deaton, the leading expert on measuring global poverty and a former true believer, in his fine book The Great\u00a0Escape. Gates says he pays his personal taxes. Great. But he made all that money from Microsoft which, like other tax-avoiding technology giants such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, uses sophisticated systems to shift paper profits around the planet and evade the designs of governments. Indeed, so extreme are its methods the company was used as a case study in a Senate investigation into US corporate tax avoidance, which found one example\u00a0of offshoring profits through a tiny Puerto Rico office alone saved it $4m a\u00a0day in taxes. Moving earnings through low corporation tax countries such as Ireland, Luxembourg and Singapore means the company saved itself, according to one estimate, almost \u00a33bn annually in tax. A Harvard law professor pointed out that Microsoft&apos;s divisions in\u00a0three low-tax nations employed fewer than 2,000 people, but supposedly recorded about \u00a39.4bn of pre-tax profit in 2011 \u2013 more than the 88,000 employees working in all its other global divisions. In Britain, Microsoft reported revenues of \u00a31.7bn in a single year for online sales on which it paid no corporation tax. This is why if you look at the small print when buying software through its British website, you find you are dealing with a Luxembourg offshoot. A newspaper investigation found a small office there with just six staff handling online sales from around Europe. None of this is illegal, however absurd it appears. But it is highly unethical, especially when the chairman is exhorting countries to hand over taxpayers&apos; cash to his pet causes \u2013 and it certainly tarnishes that saintly image. According to tax campaigner Richard Murphy, Microsoft avoids a sum in tax equivalent to more than 3% of the global aid budget. Despite this, Gates was star speaker at the IF campaign rally against hunger in Hyde Park last summer \u2013 although one of the four central issues was supposed to be corporate tax dodging. Gates, when pressed on his firm&apos;s tax policies, gave the usual glib response that they play by the rules. &quot;If people want taxes at certain levels, great, set them at those levels,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&apos;s not incumbent on those companies to take shareholder money and pay huge sums that aren&apos;t required.&quot; Yet we all know these behemoths employ the best accountants and lawyers to engage in financial wizardry,\u00a0unlike most ordinary citizens handing over their full whack of hard-earned taxes each year. In doing so, these global corporations clearly subvert national governments. Close one loophole and they simply find another, shifting assets around on their spreadsheets. This is partly why congressional researchers have estimated that in less than six decades the share of federal tax revenue coming from corporate income taxes has fallen\u00a0from 32.1% to 8.9%,\u00a0forcing a far bigger burden on to other taxpayers. Governments could do far more to challenge tax-avoiding firms, not least refusing to award them state contracts. But given his status as a development guru, Gates should question the example his own firm is setting. One of the key problems facing the developing world is capital flight, which, according to one report, takes 10 times as much out of poor countries as they receive in aid. It is not just corrupt politicians and their cronies stashing stolen cash in secret accounts, but major companies using tax havens to boost profits at the expense of the poor. Gates has every right to do what he wants with his wealth. It is to his credit he is giving away so much, persuading other billionaires to do the same and championing causes close to his heart \u2013 although as others have pointed out, even this is not immune to tax advantages. His determination to push vaccinations and prevent malaria is laudable. But if he wants to discuss development, preach about poverty and tell nations how to spend taxpayers&apos; money, he should put his own house in order first.

It called for five trees each of 13 different species, as if in an arboretum, on the grounds of an elementary school in a densely-populated neighborhood.\u00a0 It seemed like a worthy plan, both for the volunteer effort and the intended environmental and beautification benefits. Then someone pointed out that there were hardly any oaks on the list, even though the 22 oak species native to the area are known to be wildlife-friendly. Local foresters, much less local wildlife, could barely recognize some of the species that were being proposed instead. As if to drive home the logical inconsistencies, both the school and the neighborhood were named after oak trees.\u00a0&quot;Why are we doing this?&quot; someone wondered.\u00a0 That sort of epiphany has been happening a lot lately in metropolitan areas around the world, as people come to terms with both the dramatic increase in urbanized areas and the corresponding loss of wildlife. The portion of the planet characterized as urban is on track to triple from 2000 to 2030\u2014that is, we are already almost halfway there. Meanwhile,\u00a017 percent of the 800 or so North American bird species\u00a0are in decline, and all 20 species on the Audubon Society\u2019s list of &quot;common birds in decline&quot; have lost at least half their population\u00a0since 1970.\u00a0 Those kinds of stark numbers, repeated around the world, have made it disturbingly evident that it\u2019s not enough for cities to plant a million trees, preach the gospel of backyard gardens, or build green roofs and smart streets. The trees, shrubs, and flowers in that ostensibly green infrastructure also need to benefit birds, butterflies, and other animals. They need to provide habitat for breeding, shelter, and food. Where possible, the habitat needs to be arranged in corridors where wildlife can safely travel.\u00a0 Though it may be too soon to call it an urban wildlife movement, initiatives focused on urban biodiversity seem to be catching on. The U.S. Forest Service, which once laughed off the idea that anything urban could be wild,\u00a0now supports a growing\u00a0urban forest program. Urban ecology and urban wildlife programs are also proliferating on university campuses. There\u2019s a\u00a0&quot;Nature of Cities&quot;\u00a0blog, launched in 2012. University of Virginia researchers recently announced the beginning of a\u00a0Biophilic Cities Network\u00a0devoted to integrating the natural world into urban life, with Singapore, Oslo, and Phoenix among the founding partners.\u00a0 And in Baltimore County, officials now stipulate that canopy trees, rather than specimen, or ornamental, trees, must make up 80 percent of any planting on county land, and half of them need to be oaks. In an area where local nurseries hardly ever stocked oaks before, people sometimes balk, until the county\u2019s natural resource manager, Don Outen, explains the logic of it: Research has shown that oaks benefit everything from caterpillars to songbirds. Even fish prosper, because the aquatic invertebrates they feed on favor oak leaves on stream bottoms. At that point, says Outen, the reaction tends to shift to, &quot;Why haven\u2019t we been doing this before?&quot;\u00a0 One reason is that researchers have barely begun to think about what wildlife already lives in the city, or how to encourage more of it. The importance of oaks in U.S. Mid-Atlantic states, for instance, came as news to most people in 2009, when Douglas Tallamy, a University of Delaware entomologist, published a ranking of trees and shrubs according to how many caterpillar species they harbor. (The Royal Horticultural Society has\u00a0published a comparable list\u00a0for Britain.) In contrast to oaks, which accommodate 537 species, says Tallamy,\u00a0gingkoes, a standard street tree in many cities, host just three. &quot;But there is this myth that a tree has to come from China to survive in cities,&quot; he comments.\u00a0 Tallamy likes to point out that a single pair of Carolina chickadees needs to bring 6,000-9,000 caterpillars to the nest to rear a clutch of a half-dozen nestlings. Black-capped chickadees probably need more. If you want the birds, he says, you need the caterpillars, and to get the caterpillars you need the right trees. &quot;All plants are not created equal,&quot; he says. &quot;Natives are more likely to be beneficial than non-natives, but even among natives, there are differences.&quot; For instance, though tulip trees are undoubtedly\u00a0majestic, at 160 feet in height, they are stingy with wildlife, hosting just 21 caterpillar species.\u00a0 At the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), based at the University of California at San Barbara, researchers have begun to fill in a more detailed picture of\u00a0what urban wildlife means. Because wildlife survey data often ends up in scattered locations, and recorded in different formats, they are developing a unified database, with species lists, abundance, and, in some cases, habitat types for urban wildlife in 156 global cities so far.\u00a0 The preliminary evidence may be more encouraging than people tend to think, says Fresno State University ecologist Madhusudan Katti. Although pigeons, starlings, house sparrows, and barn swallows tend to turn up in cities worldwide, these four cosmopolitan species don\u2019t necessarily indicate that urban wildlife has become entirely homogenized. Cities also capture about 20 percent of the world\u2019s avian biodiversity, says Katti. That number may be skewed higher, he cautions, because younger cities tend to have more native birds. So it may be a transient effect. But understanding what\u2019s happening before species start to disappear opens up the opportunity for interventions and urban design to retain them.\u00a0 A new study in the journal\u00a0Landscape and Urban Planning\u00a0also looks at better ways of understanding urban wildlife and habitat in combination. The study uses birds as bio-indicators for other wildlife types because they are easier to count than shy, often nocturnal, mammals, and because they are more broadly familiar to the public. &quot;They\u2019re active during the day, they\u2019re colorful, they sing,&quot; says Susannah Lerman, a University of Massachusetts ornithologist and lead author of the new study. &quot;So even ifmost people know nothing about wildlife, they know something about birds.&quot;\u00a0 The study proposes a marriage of i-Tree and eBird, two current methods for keeping track of the natural world. Designed by the U.S. Forest Service,\u00a0i-Tree\u00a0is software used by organizations around the world to record data on urban tree cover, from single trees to entire forests. Its counterpart,\u00a0eBird, from Cornell Lab of Ornithology, is a checklist system enabling thousands of birders around the world to log their observations into a central database. The combination of the two enables researchers to assess not just which trees characterize a neighborhood, but how good they are as bird habitat, and which birds are using them.\u00a0 To demonstrate the usefulness of this methodology, the study\u2019s co-authors looked at 10 municipalities in the U.S. Northeast for which tree data happened to be available. They were aiming to show that the technology can work in the broadest possible range of communities. So they included municipalities from Moorestown, N.J., a Philadelphia bedroom community with a population of about 20,000, on up to New York City with 8.3 million. The ambition was to provide a quick tool for urban planners to assess how a proposed development would affect local wildlife, or which neighborhoods could benefit most from habitat improvements.\u00a0 Accommodating wildlife in cities doesn\u2019t necessarily require massive investment, says Lerman. You can bring in more birds, she says, just by breaking up endless lawns with the right kinds of shrubs, to create structure and variety. Mowing those lawns a little less often \u2014 not weekly but every two or three weeks \u2014 will increase the population of native bees and other pollinators. As for bird feeders, they don\u2019t necessarily increase overall bird populations, but they do present one significant hazard: They can become &quot;ecological traps,&quot; luring birds to their deaths in a sort of cat smorgasbord. Just keeping cats indoors, says Lerman, could prevent the\u00a0loss of billions of birds in the United States every year.\u00a0 In Britain, adds Mark Goddard, of the University of Leeds, allotments, or community gardens, in urban areas make a major difference for pollinating insects, probably because they tend to feature fruit trees and bushes and because the weedy corners tend to be a little more insect-friendly than private gardens. Concern about dwindling pollinator species has also led to the recent proliferation of 60\u00a0wildflower meadows\u00a0in British cities, modeled after the extensive meadows planted around the\u00a0site of the 2012 London Olympics.\u00a0 The new study by Lerman and her co-authors may also inadvertently have hit on one unlikely source of hope for urban wildlife: Civic pride and competitiveness. Their study looked at the relative wildlife-friendliness of 10 sample cities and boiled the differences down to a series of numbers indicating how well each city accommodated nine representative species. While the study scrupulously avoids an overall ranking of cities, it would be easy enough for local partisans to look at the numbers and make invidious comparisons. For instance, among the big cities, Philadelphia ranked first,\u00a0followed by Washington, D.C. Boston lagged well behind. But it beat New York, and New York topped its Hudson River neighbor, Jersey City.\u00a0 No formal &quot;green city&quot; competition exists in this country, at least not yet. But the &quot;Britain in Bloom&quot; contest, sponsored by the Royal Horticultural Society, increasingly focuses on pollinators and other environmental criteria. Along with a certain amount of municipal bombast, it manages to elicit a vast planting effort in British cities and towns year after year.\u00a0 Maybe it\u2019s a fantasy to think anything like that could happen in the United States. But just imagine: Right now, mayors do verbal jousting over meaningless contests between teams that are merely\u00a0named\u00a0for wildlife \u2014 Chicago Cubs versus St. Louis Cardinals, Anaheim Ducks versus San Jose Sharks, Atlanta Hawks versus Charlotte Bobcats, and so on, through an entire zoo\u2019s worth of rivalries.\u00a0 If those mayors had to go toe-to-toe over the real thing \u2014&quot;My city has more wildlife than yours,&quot; &quot;My city has more green space than yours,&quot; &quot;My city is a better place for bird, butterflies, and people to live&quot;\u2014 that would be a competition worth watching.\u00a0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2014/jan/07/guardian-weekly-letters-obama-surveillance", "sentences": ["In fact, the real surprise has been the very limited impact of these blunt austerity measures on the global US economy in 2013.Francois P JeanjeanOttawa, Canada Tensions in Singapore Your report on rioting arising from tension between Singaporeans and migrant workers in the city&apos;s Little India district is a reminder that we need to understand the way in which class and ethnicity interact with one another as part of the social dynamic making Singapore what it is today (13 December).", "Beneath the surface of Singapore&apos;s authoritarian democracy is, and always has been, a measure of social tension, which came to the surface [through race riots] in 1964 and which, like the current disturbance, had a class as well as a communal dimension.", "It is in large measure in response to this mostly subterranean tension that Singapore&apos;s national unity has always relied on a high degree of state coercion to hold its society together."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-07T14:00:02Z", "title": "Guardian Weekly Letters, 10 January 2014", "tags": [], "article": "Obama is not to blame Ed Pilkington (Obama&apos;s bubble continues to deflate, 20 December) and many other commentators express disappointment at Barack Obama&apos;s inability to achieve a swag of reforms in the US and imply, if not state outright, that this indicates indecisiveness at best and weakness or insincerity at worst on his part. Democratic institutions such as those in the US and most western political systems are designed to prevent maverick leaders from exercising untrammelled power through the checks and balances of the parliamentary system. As long as the parliament does its job properly, this works OK, but if it becomes dysfunctional or corrupted, there is no way that the leader can override it. If subsequent elections fail to produce a government that works any better, radicalisation often occurs and the most extreme form of this is a military coup. This usually leads to even worse consequences, as we have seen in Chile, Greece, Egypt and others over the last century; in fact, the only beneficial military coup in this period was that led by Ataturk almost 100 years ago. Most of the blame for our current woes is being directed at the leaders in both Australia and US, but I suggest that both our parliamentary systems are in very poor shape and should carry the major responsibility for our problems. Evolution works through both gradual adaptation and through traumatic cataclysm. Let&apos;s hope we have the sense to develop our institutions of government through the former rather than have to suffer the latter.David BarkerBunbury, Western Australia Dangers of surveillance Alan Rusbridger&apos;s missive Inside the surveillance state (20 December) fills one with despair for the English-speaking Christian countries that comprise the total surveillance states: namely, the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It took 800 years from the date of the Magna Carta to the present for democratic principles based on the freedom of the individual to grow and mature among the same people. It is a great irony that the creators of democracy have become its executioners. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, visitors to that country came back with scare stories of how the KGB was following them continuously, watching and noting down their utterances and activities. Now our governments have CCTV cameras, telephones, internet and emails to do the same job with meticulous efficiency, without causing us any concern or pain. When a country loses its self-confidence, no matter how powerful it may be, it resorts to total surveillance, as with the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany in the past. Who thought that surveillance was the harbinger of destruction for those political systems at their height of power? The total surveillance state that our political leaders have created with the intention of safeguarding our freedom and security brings to mind a verse from the Hindu holy book, the Bhagavad Gita: I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.Bill MathewMelbourne, Australia Tensions in east Asia Your coverage of the current situation in the East China Sea (Escalating tensions leave Japan depending on US support more than ever, 6 December, and Unapologetic Japan squares up to China, 13 December) downplays a few important points that may affect the outcome. First, it is worth remembering that the current escalation really began when Shintaro Ishihara, then governor of Tokyo, now co-leader of the Japan Restoration party, bounced the previous government into buying the Senkakus from their private owner. As such, the current situation is as much down to the behaviour of the slow-witted nationalists now running Japan as it is to Chinese &quot;aggression&quot;. Second, when China established its Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), all airlines in the region complied with the Chinese demand to file flight plans and to identify all aircraft to Chinese military air traffic control. A week after the ADIZ was imposed, the Japanese government instructed Japan&apos;s major carriers to cease filing flight plans and to tell their pilots to cease identifying their flights to the Chinese authorities. Given the tensions in this region, such action represents the height of irresponsibility, as airline passengers may be used as guinea pigs to test Chinese intentions. The real risk factor here is conflict starting by accident. The danger is the hot-shot Chinese fighter pilot, a little hung-over, having a bad day, and then sent to intercept an &quot;unidentified&quot; aircraft leaving Japanese airspace. Should such a tragedy befall a Japanese commercial flight in the present era of tension, I have little faith in the Japanese government&apos;s ability, or even intention, to contain the situation.David LayfieldOkinawa, Japan Hungarians are not extremists If Andr\u00e1s Schiff is that worried about the imminent resurgence of fascism in Hungary (20 December) why doesn&apos;t he come home and get his hands dirty? The answer perhaps, is that there is no prospect of one actually occurring. Yes, there is Jobbik, recently down from 16% to 13% in the Tarki poll, and yes, Jobbik thugs occasionally do nasty, stupid things in public. But one wonders what public soul-searching of the kind Schiff proposes would actually achieve \u2013 apart from giving a heady dash of oxygen to the fascists. In fact one could argue that Viktor Orb\u00e1n&apos;s current policy of letting them self-combust is actually proving quite successful. Hungary has its problems: near-starvation in some rural areas, little prospect of a quick escape from its economic straitjacket and the absence of a credible opposition. But its long-suffering people are resigned and, some might say, overly tolerant, not extremist.David NorthNagykov\u00e1csi, Hungary The dilemma of austerity Austerity is never a popular word and stimulating an economy in recession with easy monetary policy and fiscal deficits is usually good economic policy (US takes a welcome step away from austerity, 20 December). Unfortunately, the resulting increase in the public debt is not always possible because, in many cases, this debt is already considered to be too high by the financial sector. As a result, further borrowing may become impossible or so costly that it becomes too much of a burden, as Greece, Italy and a few other countries have discovered. Many governments face a dilemma between increasing their deficits to stimulate growth and reducing their debt to avoid the dangerous risk of insolvency. Harry Stein is mistaken when he suggests that the choice is between austerity and economic growth. The reality is that some countries have no choice but to follow austerity. Stein is right to suggest that tax changes would have been better than sequestration to reduce both government expenses and the public debt, but his claim that sequestration caused terrible damage in 2013 is exaggerated, at least at the global level. The reality is that the US economy has performed better than the year before and unemployment has declined. Admittedly, the recovery has been weaker than in previous cases but the recession was also sharper. In fact, the real surprise has been the very limited impact of these blunt austerity measures on the global US economy in 2013.Francois P JeanjeanOttawa, Canada Tensions in Singapore Your report on rioting arising from tension between Singaporeans and migrant workers in the city&apos;s Little India district is a reminder that we need to understand the way in which class and ethnicity interact with one another as part of the social dynamic making Singapore what it is today (13 December). Beneath the surface of Singapore&apos;s authoritarian democracy is, and always has been, a measure of social tension, which came to the surface [through race riots] in 1964 and which, like the current disturbance, had a class as well as a communal dimension. It is in large measure in response to this mostly subterranean tension that Singapore&apos;s national unity has always relied on a high degree of state coercion to hold its society together. That tension, and the state coercion that holds it in check, is reflected in the city&apos;s ill-fated Speakers&apos; Corner in Hong Lim Park. That spacious and very well-organised speaking venue, modelled on the London equivalent in Hyde Park, has no speakers because its potential orators are too afraid of arrest. Class and race are, in effect, among the proscribed topics for discussion at this venue because they are, perhaps understandably given what happened in 1964, considered too destabilising.Terry HewtonAdelaide, South Australia Briefly \u2022 The &quot;newly discovered gas&quot; that is more than &quot;7,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at warming the Earth&quot; (Dispatches, 20 December) certainly deserves to be monitored closely. It becomes a little less scary, though, when you consider that it is actually a liquid, not a gas: Perfluorotributylamine (PFTBA) has a boiling point of 178C at atmospheric pressure, which should make it relatively easy to contain the substance in a closed system. Moreover, a rough estimate based on the figure of 7,000 and established chemical calculations leads me to conclude that one gram of PFTBA released into the atmosphere is equivalent in destructive potential to the carbon dioxide that results from burning around 250ml of petrol \u2013 or from driving an average car for about 8km.Egbert von SteuberLingen, Germany \u2022 That Claire Armitstead should have characterised Dogmatix as &quot;evil-tempered&quot; may be a bit unfair to the cuddly and mild-mannered mascot (3 January). Only under the influence of a wee drop of potion does he transmogrify to unleash his inner beserker \u2013 reminiscent of the Hulk&apos;s rage. And like the latter he swells his girth (or maybe just puffs himself up) and rampages in dogged pursuit of Roman popinjays.R M FranssonDenver, Colorado, US \u2022 I enjoyed Ian Jack&apos;s article on the coverage of the (undoubtedly great) man&apos;s death (20 December).

Money, adulation and marketing are the key tenets of a well-planned, well-publicised pre-season visit. Sporting gains are usually far outweighed by financial ones. What, then, would the Premier League bean counters have made of Dallas Tornado, and their extraordinary world tour of 1967-68? Playing 32 games, across five continents and 26 countries over a seven-month period, Dallas, in just about every sense, took on the world. From Spain in August to Honduras in March, via Christmas in Tokyo and New Year in Manila, this was genuine football globetrotting. And long before it was fashionable, too. No product-placement, milking the market or &quot;expanding the brand&quot; here. Dallas&apos; journey saw them cheat death, Final Destination style, at the hands of Greek-Cypriot terrorists, visit Vietnam whilst war raged around them, and survive an on-pitch riot in Singapore. The football, at times, must have felt like a sideshow. Some sideshow, mind. During the tour, Tornado played in front of crowds of up to 50,000, and against sides of the calibre of Real Oviedo, Fenerbahce and the Japanese national team. &quot;An amazing trip that will never be repeated again,&quot; is how Bill Crosbie, one of the players involved, describes the tour. Even that hardly seems to do it justice. This was a plot worthy of Hollywood. Crosbie was a 19-year-old bus conductor when he answered an advert in the Liverpool Echo, looking for &quot;top-class amateur footballers&quot;. Soon afterwards, he was asked to attend an interview at the city&apos;s Adelphi Hotel. There, he found a man named Bob Kap. Serbian by birth, Kap \u2013 real name Bo\u017eidar Kapu\u0161to \u2013 had studied alongside Ferenc Puskas at the Hungarian national football academy, but was forced to flee Europe during the 1956 uprising. He moved to Toronto, Canada, where he worked briefly as a reporter for a local football magazine. His true passion, though, was always for coaching. So when Dallas, looking for someone to prepare a team for the inaugural North American Soccer League, came calling, he jumped at the chance. Kap used his contacts to recruit from across Europe. Eight of the touring side were English, and seven of those were Merseysiders. They were supplemented by five Norwegians, two Dutchmen, two Swedes and, improbably, just one American, Jay Moore. Crosbie remembers his initial meeting with Kap well: &quot;I was asked a lot of questions, about the amateur teams I had played for, how fast a runner I was, why I wanted to join his team, things like that.&quot; Flanking the coach was Dave Moorcroft, a local amateur player of some pedigree. Moorcroft had played for Skelmersdale United at Wembley in the FA Amateur Cup final, and would go on to play more than 100 times for Tranmere Rovers. &quot;He was there to vet the players,&quot; remembers Crosbie. &quot;I remember leaving thinking that was the last I would hear on that.&quot; He was wrong. A month later, a telegram arrived at his home, asking him to a second meeting, this time at the Regent Hotel. It was the message that would change his life. &quot;He asked me how much notice I would have to give at work,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;I said two weeks, but in extreme circumstances one week. He told me if I wanted to join his team then I would have to fly to the South of France the following morning!&quot; Crosbie, who had he been on duty that night would have missed Kap&apos;s telegram, agreed, only to be told there was a further condition from his new manager. &quot;Bob told me that the next time he saw me, I had better have had a haircut!&quot; he remembers. &quot;My hair was shoulder-length at the time, very much like The Beatles, but Bob wanted an All American look, crew cuts for everyone. It had to go.&quot; Luckily, one of Crosbie&apos;s neighbours was a hairdresser, and so was summoned to an emergency 10pm appointment. Bill&apos;s brother was given a resignation letter to hand in to his bosses, and that was that. He was on the first train out of Lime Street the following morning. &quot;We did not have a phone, so I could not even contact my girlfriend to say goodbye!&quot; Crosbie laughs. Together with another Scouser, Bobby Roach, Crosbie flew to Nice to join up with the side. Tornado had already played five games by that point, visiting both Spain and Morocco. The last was a 4-0 defeat to Real Oviedo, then playing in the Segunda Division. With Crosbie and Bobby Roach on board, and with the players instructed to wear club suits complete with Stetson hats wherever they went, Dallas travelled to Istanbul, drawing 2-2 with the Turkish champions Fenerbahce, having led 2-0 at one stage, in front of a crowd of 25,000. Crosbie missed the game with a virus, which doctors believed was caused by undergoing too many injections within a short space of time. Their next game was to take place in Cyprus, though fate would rear its head before then. After a day sightseeing at the Acropolis, the team were delayed heading to the airport and missed their flight from Athens to Nicosia by half an hour. Lucky them. Flight BEA CY284 exploded at 29,000ft after a bomb was detonated under a seat, killing 63 people. Its intended target, the Greek army general Georgios Grivas, had also missed the flight, and later travelled to Nicosia on the same plane as the Tornado team. &quot;Missing that plane was the best thing we ever did,&quot; says Crosbie, with grim understatement. &quot;But that second flight was the longest two hours of my life!&quot; Two defeats in Cyprus, including one in 95 degree heat, were followed by a trip, via Beirut, to Tehran, where they took on an Iranian Air Force team containing seven internationals, losing 2-1. Draws with a Tehran Select XI and a Governors&apos; XI in Shiraz followed. Kap, though, was preparing to shake up his squad. Crosbie remembers: &quot;A new player called Graham Stirland had joined the tour in France. He was a winger, a fantastic player who was always getting back to help his fullback out. &quot;We arrived in Tehran for our next flight and Graham was asked to follow Frank Randorf, Bob Kap&apos;s assistant, to the toilets. Ten minutes later, Frank returned alone. When we asked where Graham was, we were told that Mr Kap did not think he was mixing with the other players and he was sent home to England. We were not even allowed to say goodbye and that was the last we saw of him.&quot; From Tehran, the squad embarked upon a mammoth tour of the Iranian mountains, taking in games in Rasht and Shahi, as well as three seven-hour coach journeys. With the squad preparing to leave Iran for Pakistan, the Norwegian defender Tom Weinholdt returned home to undergo knee surgery, reducing Kap&apos;s numbers to just 16, of which two were goalkeepers. Nonetheless, Tornado saw off the Pakistan national team 2-0 in front of 35,000 spectators in Karachi. The following day, in Lahore, a new Pakistani side gained revenge, winning the &apos;Second Test&apos; 4-2 in front of 25,000. Games in Lahore, Dhaka and Chittagong followed, before the side headed to India. &quot;We took a four-hour ride on a rickety old bus to the border,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;Then when we got to the border, we had to take our suitcases off the bus and walk the last 400 yards. &quot;There were local rioters screaming and hurling abuse because the country we were walking to was India. We got through passport control and walked 400 yards to our next bus, and the people were laying garlands at our feet!&quot; To make matters worse, a number of non-Commonwealth players had been denied entry to India, and were forced to spend two days waiting for their visas in a run-down hotel near to the border. &quot;They told us the only thing they had to eat in those days was a small chicken,&quot; says Crosbie, whose British passport ensured he made it through without a hitch. Dallas played seven games in India, winning only one, before heading to Sri Lanka. Having lost two games against the national team, they were off to Burma but, typically, their journey was not without danger. &quot;We should have flown via Madras and Calcutta on the 25th of November,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;But when we got to Calcutta there were political riots going on and all flights were cancelled. We had to hide in our hotel for two days, playing billiards and cards, and left on the 28th at 4am to sneak out of India.&quot; From Burma, and a defeat to the national team in front of 47,000, it was on to Singapore, and a hostile reception from locals angered at the arrival of &quot;Yankee Imperialists&quot;. That hostility extended from the stands to the pitch. Crosbie remembers: &quot;When one of our players, Per Larsen, fouled one of theirs, they started throwing stones and other things onto the pitch. Per then further annoyed them by bowing. We had to be escorted from the pitch and stayed in the dressing room for two hours after the game.&quot; A re-match the following day was, wisely, cancelled, and the team travelled to Jakarta for two games, before moving on to Saigon. This was a critical juncture in the Vietnam War. The Tet offensive, seen by many as the turning point of the conflict, began a month after Tornado&apos;s last game, a 2-2 draw with Club Saigon. &quot;We were well-protected, with a police escort from the airport to hotel,&quot; says Crosbie. &quot;But we were allowed to walk around Saigon on our own as sightseers!&quot; Despite a telling off from American Military Police for standing still on a Saigon street corner \u2013 a dangerous move with locals patrolling the area on scooters armed with hand grenades \u2013 Crosbie and the team left Vietnam unscathed and unbeaten, and travelled via Hong Kong to Taiwan, where they beat the national team in front of 43,000. Christmas was spent in Tokyo. The players were each given portable Panasonic radios as gifts from the management, and sampled the delights of sushi for the first time before losing 3-2 to Japan in Osaka on Boxing Day. They had already lost 2-1 in Tokyo&apos;s Olympic Stadium, used for the 1964 Games, on Christmas Eve. Next stop was Manila, and a 7-0 win over a Select XI on New Year&apos;s Day. A defeat to the Philippines National team followed, before an 18-hour journey to Australia for what was to be the home stretch of the tour. Nine games, spread across Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti, saw a tiring team, minus the goalkeeper Odd Linberg who had returned home ill, win just three times. By the time they headed back to Dallas on 15 February, they were given two weeks to &quot;set up their lives&quot; ahead of the NASL season, before a four-game &quot;mini-tour&quot; of Central America. &quot;We were exhausted, both mentally and physically,&quot; says Crosbie, and his assessment would appear to have been spot on. Dallas lost their first league game 6-0 to Houston Stars, and won just four of their 32 NASL fixtures that season, losing 26. Their goal difference, minus 81, told its own story. Kap, unsurprisingly, was replaced by Keith Spurgeon early in the campaign. Crosbie, too, would depart early. Having snapped ankle ligaments in a game on a baseball pitch at St Louis, he would eventually leave the squad after playing just six matches. &quot;I enjoyed my time in the USA,&quot; he says. &quot;But my work Visa only allowed me to play soccer. This was the time of Vietnam, and foreign nationals who were not using their work visas could be drafted to the US army. The risk was too great, so I went back to England.&quot; Dallas would play a key role in the NASL until their dissolution in 1981. They were championship winners in 1971, and finished runners up two years later. The likes of Alex Stepney, Alan Hinton and the Liverpool duo Kevin Kewley and Brian Kettle would all represent the club at various points. Their World Tour, however, is easily the greatest, most incredible tale in their history. As Crosbie, who hopes to organise a reunion for the players next year, says, we will never see its kind again. Kap&apos;s legacy, meanwhile, remains. He is widely credited with changing the face of NFL by introducing &quot;soccer-style&quot; kickers to the game in the early 1970s. One of his recommendations, an Austrian named Toni Fritsch, was the first European-trained soccer player to play in the NFL, and Kap would directly introduce eight more in the next three years. Ever the innovator, Kap would attract headlines in 1978 when fronting a &quot;business syndicate&quot; that attempted to acquire the Argentine World Cup star Ricky Villa. The bid, audacious in the extreme, failed. Villa, along with Ossie Ardiles, moved to Tottenham instead. In later years, Kap would become an accomplished painter. Some of his work, Gridiron-themed, can be found in the NFL Hall of Fame building in Canton, Ohio. Kap died in his sleep in Ontario, Ottawa in March 2010, aged 87. His role in the Dallas Tornado World Tour, however, should ensure his place in football history is assured. You might not have heard of him until today, but nobody who went on that tour will ever forget Bob Kap. \u2022 A shorter version of this article appeared in the Liverpool Echo on December 20, 2013.

Chief executive Peter Sands announced plans to merge the wholesale and consumer divisions in an attempt to energise the emerging markets bank, which is suffering its first profits slump in a decade. The move is likely to lead to job cuts. He was forced to insist &quot;I&apos;m not going anywhere&quot; after the departures and promoted the current boss of the wholesale division \u2013 Mike Rees \u2013 to become his deputy. Chairman Sir John Peace also had no plans to leave, said Sands. One of the highest paid bankers in the industry after receiving nearly \u00a335m in the past four years, Rees was immediately seen as the heir apparent to Sands, appearing to have usurped Meddings, previously regarded as the natural successor. Amid concerns about the bank&apos;s financial strength the shares fell to their lowest level since it paid \u00a3415m to settle money laundering allegations in the US just over a year ago, though they recovered some of their losses to end the day down 2% at \u00a312.83 after Sands insisted the bank was comfortable with its capital position. Sands and Meddings, who insisted the decision to go was his own and taken in the Christmas holidays, had been credited with steering the bank through the financial crisis relatively unscathed until 2012&apos;s money laundering scandal in the US. &quot;It was totally my decision to leave,&quot; said Meddings, often a candidate on lists drawn up for top jobs at rivals. &quot;After 11 years on the board of this bank and seven years as finance director it seems a natural time to step away,&quot; he added. The bank was facing questions about the decision to keep paying Meddings his \u00a3800,000 salary until next year, as well as a potential bonus, even though he will leave in June. The 55-year-old is also walking away with unvested shares currently worth about \u00a38m but whose actual value will only be known when they pay out over the next three years. Meddings&apos; pension pot is likely to reach \u00a37m by the time his 12-month contract expires next year. Meddings had been caught up in the money laundering scandal when remarks by an unnamed bank official to a US colleague \u2013 &quot;You fucking Americans&quot; \u2013 were said have come from him. Also leaving is Singapore-based Steve Bertamini, head of the consumer division, whose role is &quot;falling away&quot; according to Sands. Bertamini was hired in 2008 and the last \u00a3900,000 instalment of his signing-on fee will be paid in May \u2013 two months after he leaves the board. He will have his relocation to the US paid for by the bank, receive his \u00a3600,000 salary until this time next year and take away with him unvested shares worth \u00a36m at current market values, although that value is subject to change . Sands described both departing executives as &quot;outstanding leaders&quot; and &quot;good friends&quot; who would be missed. He said neither was receiving any form of payoff. Last year it emerged regulators had required Meddings to be stripped of responsibility for the risk functions at the bank and Sandy Chen, analyst at Cenkos, said: &quot;FD Meddings&apos; departure is key \u2013 his position had already begun to erode at the end of last year, with risk oversight transferred from him to Peter Sands.&quot; Chen said later his concerns had been allayed and he had been reassured that further management changes were not on the way and that the bank could generate enough capital. Sands \u2013 chief executive since November 2006 \u2013 sought to quash speculation about a boardroom rift. &quot;We remain very comfortable with our capital position and have no plans [for a rights issue of new stock]. We have a unified board which is fully behind the strategy&quot;. Meddings said he had not decided what to do next and quipped he might consider financial journalism. One investor said: &quot;It&apos;s not an ideal world having a finance director leaving without a replacement&quot;. There was speculation that Naguib Kheraj, one-time Barclays finance director and a non-executive at Standard Chartered, might be a candidate while head of strategy Anna Marrs was also cited by some. Rees&apos; salary will rise to \u00a3975,000 pounds from \u00a3735,000 in April although his earnings potential fall by 40%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/09/railway-man-review", "sentences": ["It is an adaptation of the 1995 memoir by Eric Lomax, the former Royal Signals officer who described his wartime experiences of being forced to work on the Burma railway after the fall of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-09T21:30:00Z", "title": "The Railway Man \u2013 review | Peter Bradshaw", "tags": ["Drama", "Colin Firth", "Nicole Kidman", "Second world war", "Culture", "Film", "World news", "The Railway Man"], "article": " \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nHere is an intensely well-intentioned movie with an important story to tell, but also, unfortunately, with jarringly awkward moments and very serious casting problems.

And the Swedish actor Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd is woefully and bafflingly miscast as Finlay, Lomax's old mate from the war. He makes no real attempt to do an English accent; it isn't easy to read how angry and agonised he is theoretically supposed to be.

The education minister, Christopher Pyne, has made numerous claims about the national curriculum \u2013 some of which, education advocates argue, are demonstrably false. Here, Guardian Australia examines the key claims and the frequency of topics in the curriculum, following complaints about a lack of emphasis on conservative leaders, the Anzac story and western civilisation. Leftwing bias The claim: The Coalition\u2019s policy document on schools, released in August 2013, flagged a review of the national curriculum, saying it had \u201cbecome politicised\u201d under Labor. \u201cFor example, the current curriculum suggests that our students are best served learning about the day-to-day activities of trade unions and the history of the Australian Labor party. For example, the curriculum contains two references to trade unions, four references to progressive ideas and associated movements, and the only prime minister to be explicitly referenced is John Curtin. There is no explicit mention of the conservative parties in the curriculum,\u201d the document said. The facts: John Curtin is not the only prime minister mentioned. The history curriculum also refers to Australia\u2019s first prime minister, Edmund Barton, and to George Reid, who was appointed in 1904 following the fall of a minority Labor government whose Arbitration Bill he labelled as \u201csocialism\u201d. These leaders are discussed in the context of a Year 6 history module that focuses on \u201cstudying Australia\u2019s path to federation through an examination of key people (for example Henry Parkes, Edmund Barton, George Reid, John Quick)\u201d. Curtin \u2013 Australia\u2019s 14th prime minister and a member of the Labor party \u2013 governed during the second world war. A year 10 history module mentions Curtin in the context of the fall of Singapore. The curriculum talks about \u2018\u2019explaining the significance of the fall of Singapore (1942) in the changes in Australia\u2019s military alliances and use of troops during World War II, using a range of sources (for example accounts of prisoners of war, commanders such as General Gordon Bennett, politicians such as Prime Minister John Curtin, and Japanese and British sources)\u201d. The acting deputy president of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, Denis Fitzgerald, said it would be impossible to teach students about the fall of Singapore without mentioning prime minister Curtin. Australia\u2019s longest serving prime minister and the Liberal party legend, Robert Menzies, is mentioned in the yet-to-be-implemented senior secondary modern history curriculum titled Australia, 1918 \u20131949 (End of first world war \u2013 election of Menzies). There are two references to unions or unionists, one mention of the Labor party, and no explicit references to the Liberal party in the implemented foundation to year 10 history curriculum. A year 9 history module on the first world war includes identification of \u201cthe groups who opposed conscription (for example trade unionists, Irish Catholics) and the grounds for their objections\u201d. Students also study \u201cthe first and second referenda on conscription, including the division within the Labor party over this issue\u201d. And a year 9 history module on the Industrial Revolution includes \u201coutlining the growth of trade unions as a response to the impacts of the Industrial Revolution\u201d. Western civilisation The claim: The education minister, Christopher Pyne, said concerns had been raised about the history curriculum \u201cnot recognising the legacy of western civilisation\u201d. Pyne said one of the criticisms of the curriculum was that it had \u201cnot sold or talked about the benefits of western civilisation in our society\u201d. The facts: People may have different views about the level of emphasis required, but the curriculum does not ignore western civilisation. For example, a module in Year 6 history on Australia as a Nation is focused on \u201ckey figures and events that led to Australia\u2019s Federation, including British and American influences on Australia\u2019s system of law and government\u201d. It talks about \u201cidentifying key elements of Australia\u2019s system of law and government and their origins (for example the Magna Carta; federalism; constitutional monarchy; the Westminster system and the separation of powers \u2013 legislature, executive, judiciary; the houses of parliament; how laws are made)\u201d. Year 5 history students examine the economic, political and social reasons for the establishment of British colonies in Australia. As part of this they investigate \u201cthe reasons for the establishment of one or more British colonies such as a penal colony (for example Moreton Bay, Van Diemen\u2019s Land) or a colony that later became a state (for example Western Australia, Victoria)\u201d. However, the overall cross-curriculum priorities do not explicitly include western history. The three priorities are: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures; Asia and Australia\u2019s engagement with Asia; and sustainability. Pyne suggests the curriculum is too heavily weighted towards the nation\u2019s Indigenous history with not enough about \u201cour beginnings as a colony and, therefore, our Western civilisation, which is why we are the kind of country we are today\u201d. A year 8 history in-depth study, titled \u201cThe Western and Islamic World\u201d, involves the study of \u201cthe Vikings or Medieval Europe or the Ottoman Empire or Renaissance Italy\u201d. Anzac focus The claim: Pyne also wrote, in an opinion piece in the Australian newspaper, that concerns had been raised about the history curriculum \u201cnot giving important events in Australia&apos;s history and culture the prominence they deserve, such as Anzac Day\u201d. He has previously said the Anzac spirit had \u201cinformed our Australian culture and our character ever since that time, and I don\u2019t think that lining it up with NAIDOC week, reconciliation day, harmony day and so on gives it the central focus that it deserves in our curriculum\u201d. The facts: Pyne is referring to the Year 3 history curriculum bunching together several commemorations. Students look at \u201cdays and weeks celebrated or commemorated in Australia (including Australia Day, Anzac Day, Harmony Week, National Reconciliation Week, Naidoc week and National Sorry Day) and the importance of symbols and emblems\u201d. But it is not the only reference to the Anzac story. The year 9 history topic on the first world war includes a specific section on the \u201ccommemoration of the first world war, including debates about the nature and significance of the Anzac legend\u201d. It involves \u201cinvestigating the ideals associated with the Anzac tradition and how and why first world war is commemorated within Australian society\u201d. A year 10 history section on the second world war also involves \u201cexplaining the significance of Kokoda as the battle that halted the Japanese advance on Port Moresby and helped foster the Anzac legend\u201d. By the numbers Guardian Australia has compiled a count of some other words or phrases mentioned in the history curriculum. This shows the number of times each term appears in the text of the foundation to year 10 curriculum history section: War 77 Aboriginal 50 World war 37 Western 11 First fleet 8 Vietnam 7 Anzac 6 Christianity 6 Britain 5 Diversity 5 Indigenous 5 Federation 4 England 3 Islam 3 Gallipoli 3 English 3 Muslim 2 1788 1 Unionists 1 Unions 1 Multiculturalism 1 Gay 0 James Cook 0"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/jan/10/haoliang-xu-activate-singapore-global-public-leader", "sentences": ["This month, we&apos;ll be at Activate Singapore, the Guardian&apos;s platform for digital innovators, to launch the first of this year&apos;s talks on global leadership and policy with Haoliang Xu, assistant secretary-general of the United Nations."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T08:00:01Z", "title": "UN's Haoliang Xu joins global leadership debate at Guardian's Activate Singapore", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Activate Singapore", "Media & Tech Network"], "article": "January 2014 sees the Public Leaders Network continue its prestigious series of interviews with major figures from the world of global public services.

Kevin Green, one of the country&apos;s biggest private landlords, who rents out more than 700 houses, mainly in Wales, described the universal credit benefit system as a timebomb for private landlords. He said he hoped to stick with benefit tenants but believed he was in a small minority. &quot;Most other landlords are changing now. At least 90% of landlords are considering it. I know a lot of landlords all across the UK and most are saying they&apos;re not going to support housing benefit. It&apos;s a major problem for government.&quot; Private landlords accommodate just over 1 million people who have part or all of their rent paid by the state. &quot;My worry is for the customers. People are going to be homeless as a result of it. There&apos;s absolutely no doubt about it,&quot; Green said. Fears that housing benefit will go directly to tenants under universal credit, bringing an increase in rent defaults, is prompting many landlords to consider following Fergus and Judith Wilson, who own almost 1,000 properties in Kent, who announced a week ago that they would no longer take tenants on benefits. Fergus Wilson was unrepentant, sending an outspoken and at times bizarre statement to the Guardian urging benefit claimants to &quot;get a job&quot; and calling on David Cameron to make it clear that landlords can receive benefits directly. He says: &quot;Calling Dave, Calling Dave, Fergus to Dave. Take a tip Dave! Stop this nonsense of paying housing benefit direct to the tenant! &quot;We have \u00a3800,000 arrears for those on HB [housing benefit]. Has the \u00a3800,000 caused financial difficulty \u2026 to be honest not an awful lot, but it has some!&quot; Marion Money, who rents out more than a dozen flats and houses in north Kent, said three-quarters of private landlords were considering turning away would-be renters on benefits. She said: &quot;Landlords are running scared. They are saying &apos;if I&apos;ve got a choice I&apos;ll choose somebody who&apos;s working&apos;. The government isn&apos;t giving the right message about universal credit. They seem to be in a complete mix-up. The fact it has been delayed is compounding the problem.&quot; Currently around a quarter of private tenants on housing benefits have the money paid directly to their landlords. In some cases this is because they are viewed as vulnerable, and it happens automatically if a tenant misses two rent payments. Universal credit will mean money being paid monthly rather than weekly, with an emphasis on recipients learning to budget properly. The paradox is that after trials in which some social tenants received rent money themselves for the first time, bringing a rise in defaults, the protections for private landlords are now arguably stronger. The latest Department for Work and Pensions plan would keep the system under which rent goes directly to a landlord after two missed payments, while adding a review after a first month&apos;s default. But some warn that the initial message about recipients managing their own money has stuck, while the DWP has yet to confirm whether tenants who currently have rent paid straight to landlords will keep this under universal credit. Kate Webb of Shelter argues that an already difficult climate for tenants on benefits has been made worse by the DWP. &quot;The rules will be broadly the same, and the arrears trigger will actually be stronger, but landlords are very worried. The DWP has bungled the communications. They need to be doing much more to reassure landlords about the rules,&quot; she said. A DWP spokesperson said: &quot;This is needless scaremongering. The majority of Housing Benefit claimants already receive payments directly and there is no change under Universal Credit. Our reforms ensure our strong housing safety net remains in place and there has been no fall in the number of claimants in the private rented sector. Ignoring over a million private rented sector claimants would be foolhardy for landlords&apos; business plans.&quot; What seems certain is that publicity about universal credit, and the Wilsons&apos; decision, is making it even harder for tenants on benefits to find a home. Benjamin Matthews, a letting agent in south-east London, said he was called this week by a client in Singapore: &quot;He has quite a portfolio and the majority are rented out to people who are on benefits. He wanted to know: &apos;Has something happened? Has there been a big change?&apos;&quot; A poll of National Landlords&apos; Association members has found that while three years ago almost half were aiming properties at tenants on benefits this has already dropped to 22%.Chris Norris, the NLA&apos;s head of policy, said universal credit was a major issue: &quot;The difficulty is the government has been very cagey in releasing information and timelines, and so many deadlines have been missed. They have been a little bit secretive and landlords have jumped to conclusions, or filled in the gaps themselves.&quot; Housing charities and landlords&apos; associations, while stressing that the extent of the chaos may yet not be quite so significant, have called on ministers to reassure landlords about the planned changes under universal credit, particularly those connected to housing benefit being paid to tenants rather than directly to property owners. Even landlords with a significant commitment to housing benefit are considering their options. Almost three-quarters of Green&apos;s homes are leased to such people, some with the help of charities working with young homeless people or victims of domestic violence. Green says he is something of an &quot;oddball&quot; among landlords for such efforts, but says this might have to end. &quot;It could be before the end of this year that we follow the Wilsons and say OK, we&apos;re not taking people on benefits any longer. It has to be an option for us. It&apos;s a commercial business. A lot of properties still have mortgages on them and they need to be paid.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/10/beijing-criticism-fishing-rules", "sentences": ["Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were questions about how China would enforce the rule and precisely which areas were covered."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T15:44:16Z", "title": "Beijing brushes off US criticism of its tough new fishing rules", "tags": ["China", "US foreign policy", "Vietnam", "Asia Pacific", "Philippines", "World news", "South China Sea"], "article": "China has hit back after the US, Philippines and Vietnam criticised new fishing rules that require foreign crews to request Chinese permission to work in much of the South China Sea, bolstering Beijing&apos;s claims over disputed waters. The US said the regulations are provocative and potentially dangerous. Tensions in the South China Sea have risen in recent years as a result of a complex disagreements among six nations. The area boasts valuable energy resources, as well as fisheries and some of the world&apos;s busiest shipping channels. A separate territorial dispute between China and Japan, in the East China Sea, has also drawn in the US and sparked concern about regional stability. Criticising the new rules for the South China Sea on Thursday, Jen Psaki, a US state department spokeswoman, said: &quot;Our long-standing position has been that all concerned parties should avoid any unilateral action that raises tensions and undermines the prospects for a diplomatic or other peaceful resolution of differences.&quot; But on Friday Beijing&apos;s foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the disagreement was &quot;not a problem of regulation \u2026 but a problem of the mentality of the reader&quot;. The new rules were introduced by China&apos;s southern Hainan province on 1\u00a0January. They require foreign fishing crews to obtain permits before working in much of the South China Sea. They are based on a Chinese law passed in 2004. Chunying said the government was acting according to international and domestic law, adding: &quot;For more than 30 years, China&apos;s relevant fisheries laws and regulations have been consistently implemented in a normal way, and have never caused any tension.&quot; To insist that implementation posed a threat to regional stability showed &quot;either a lack of common sense or \u2026 ulterior motives&quot;, she added. The Philippine department of foreign affairs said the policy &quot;escalates tensions, unnecessarily complicates the situation in the South China Sea and threatens the peace and stability of the region.&quot; It added it had asked China for clarification and said the regulation violated international law. Vietnam&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Luong Thanh Nghi said in a statement that Hanoi had indisputable sovereignty over the Spratly and Paracel Islands, and that &quot;all foreign activities in these areas without Vietnamese acceptance are illegal and invalid&quot;. Huang Jing, a north Asia security expert at Singapore&apos;s Lee Kuan Yew school for public policy, said there were questions about how China would enforce the rule and precisely which areas were covered. &quot;If there&apos;s some fishing boat from the Philippines or Malaysia or especially Vietnam \u2013 where the fishing industry accounts for a substantial part of GDP \u2013 by what means will China enforce the rules and will this lead to conflict? That&apos;s the issue,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;As China&apos;s capabilities become stronger and stronger, its behaviour seems to have become more and more assertive, especially in the South China Sea.&quot; Fishing crews have often been caught in the territorial wrangling. In March last year, Hanoi accused China of shooting at a Vietnamese fishing boat in the area and setting fire to its cabin. In May, a Taiwanese fisherman was shot dead by Philippines coastguards in waters claimed by both countries. Wu Shicun, the former head of Hainan&apos;s foreign affairs office, now leading a thinktank advising the government on the area, told Reuters news agency that offending foreign fishing vessels would be expelled from waters around Hainan and the disputed Paracel Islands. &quot;If we can&apos;t expel them, then we&apos;ll go on board to make checks to see whether there&apos;s any illegal fishing,&quot; said Wu, president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies. &quot;We&apos;ll drag you back to be handled, confiscate fishing gear, detain the vessel and fine [you]. The most serious fine is 500,000 yuan [\u00a350,000].&quot; While the US is not directly involved in the South China Sea dispute, Jin Canrong, of Renmin University&apos;s School of International Studies, said it was concerned about its overall freedom of navigation. The US also took action when China announced the creation of an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea late last year, including airspace over disputed islands known as the Diaoyu to China and Senkaku to Japan. It flew two unarmed B52s through the zone. Jin said: &quot;Another concern of the US is that in the past, the US and its partners set the norms and rules in Asia and they are afraid [of whether] China tries to set norms of its own. China has risen so fast and is so big. It&apos;s natural for the US to have some concern.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/10/an-mbe-hairdressing-why-not", "sentences": ["After the war came promotion and visits to Royal Navy yards in Malta, Singapore and Aden; she certainly worked for the Empire, if not for God."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T16:31:00Z", "title": "An MBE for hairdressing?

I\u00a0don&apos;t think I&apos;d ever seen one close\u00a0up before. It was bigger than I expected, and lovely in its colours: a floriated cross in pale blue enamel with a gold badge at its centre surrounded by a crimson ring, a silk ribbon in pink and grey folded beside it. Oddly, given that the design dated to the order&apos;s birth at the height of the first world war, it looked rather Teutonic, as if it might have been happy jiggling up and down on the chest of a Prussian general. But the most surprising thing was the wording in the crimson ring: FOR GOD AND THE EMPIRE, this order of chivalry&apos;s motto. Not surprising in 1917 or 1937, and perhaps surprising only to radicals as late as 1967; but to think that a medal with such a motto could be freshly minted in 2013, and not just this medal but hundreds, perhaps thousands, of them still pouring every year from the medal factory in the West Midlands, five classes of them from top to bottom, from Knights and Dames Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire to the humble Members of the same, each of them bearing the legend FOR GOD AND THE EMPIRE \u2026 the thought took some grasping. We looked at it in its box on a Sunday morning. None of us mentioned the possibility of worship, though across the watery English countryside a spire could be seen from the garden. God, or at least the god the medal had in mind, was as absent as the Grand Fleet. And yet \u2013 the rhythm of an Auden poem came to mind \u2013 all across the United Kingdom similar medals would be lying quietly in their boxes: medals for the rich, not so many for the poor, the shop on the corner, the girl next door. Soon one will be nestling in the home of Lino Carbosiero, the barber who cuts David Cameron&apos;s hair and allegedly moved his parting from left to right \u2013 not a grand enameled CBE like my friend&apos;s, nor an OBE in plain gold, but a simple MBE in silver. For God, for the Empire, for crimping. The award has caused a stir. Did the prime minister have a hand in it? This week the Daily Mirror found a Labour MP willing to suggest so, which enabled the headline &quot;David Cameron facing fresh claims of cronyism \u2026 &quot;, which Downing Street found ludicrous, honours being decided by independent committees that, according to a spokesman, were beyond prime ministerial influence. Carbosiero himself said he was surprised and thrilled by an honour that he suspected had been given him for his charitable work and his part in the campaign to turn hairdressing into a properly skilled and regulated trade. It may be true; he has raised funds in marathons and five-a-side football, and seems genuinely concerned that anyone can set up as a hairdresser and start rubbing chemicals into people&apos;s heads without training or qualifications. But it&apos;s at least as likely that his celebrity friendships put him in the frame. Among his early clients were the pop songwriting and production team Stock Aitken Waterman, who introduced him to Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. The rest is history, of a kind: as well as Cameron, his client list includes Zara Phillips, Sharon and Kelly Osbourne, Ant and Dec, Lawrence Dallaglio, Kevin Spacey, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Paul McCartney, and according to the Daily Mail columnist Jan Moir, who is herself a\u00a0client of 20 years&apos; standing, previously included Andy Coulson. In certain circles, their hairdresser is as famous as any of them, having written columns for the Sun and easyJet magazine, styled contestants in the first three series of the X Factor and endorsed several beauty products. The actor Amanda Holden kicks off the list of testimonials on his website: &quot;A day without Lino, is\u00a0like a good meal without wine. He surely is the Godfather of hairdressing.&quot; His surprise at his honour, therefore, must surely be no more than a form of politeness; society hairdressing and medals go together like the words &quot;blow&quot; and &quot;dry&quot;. Daniel Galvin, who owns the salon that employs Carbosiero as its creative director, got his OBE in 2006. The Duchess of Cornwall&apos;s stylist, Jo Hansford (&quot;the best tinter on the planet&quot; \u2013 American Vogue), got an MBE in 2009; the late Vidal Sassoon a CBE in the same year; Nicky Clarke an OBE in 2008; the late Raymond Bessone (&quot;Mr Teasy-Weasy&quot;) an OBE\u00a0in 1982. Well, why not? They make people happy. But what all these decorated hairdressers have in common are media attention, famous customers and a social connectivity that stylists beyond London can only dream of. We can be sure that the salons of Swansea, Rochdale and Falkirk also dispense happiness, certainly more cheaply and perhaps in equal measure, but have they any medals to show for it? I first heard the question addressed in my childhood \u2013 why them and not us, or rather why her and not me? \u2013 when my Aunt Ella, my father&apos;s much younger sister, got an MBE for her work in what was then known as the Admiralty. For a girl who left school at 15 and started work in a Fife butcher&apos;s shop, my aunt had done well. Hard-learned shorthand and typing had won her a government job in London, where just before the outbreak of war she became a clerical assistant to a succession of naval bigwigs in Whitehall. After the war came promotion and visits to Royal Navy yards in Malta, Singapore and Aden; she certainly worked for the Empire, if not for God. But hadn&apos;t my father also worked? A foreman mechanic, overalls, dirty hands. Machines under his supervision had poured out great lengths of cotton, linen and fire brigade hose. Where was the justice in the MBE for his pen-pushing little sister? In fact, I suspect he didn&apos;t mind, and may even have been a little proud. What was incontestable in his view, and looks even more incontestable now, is that the honours system is ridiculous. A person&apos;s worth calibrated by its rankings, the mystifications of the fine difference, GBE or DBE, a code that specifies Bob Geldof KBE and not Sir Bob Geldof, allegedly impartial committees: what do\u00a0all these solemn intricacies matter when the outcome so often flows from friendship and lobbying, or a government&apos;s attempts to be popular, or a financial contribution to a political party? Perhaps honours really should be\u00a0confined to people who do demonstrably good or brave things, such as saving children from drowning or single-handedly capturing an\u00a0enemy machine-gun nest. Still, I liked the delight my friend took in his CBE, which was for his services to journalism. No drownings prevented, no enemy overpowered; a reward instead for creating two fine magazines, for writing entertainingly and inspiring others to do the same. On the one hand, FOR GOD AND THE EMPIRE is charming and perhaps rightly implies that the best place for honours is the antique shop. On the other, it makes a comedy of ideas that were once powerful to our ancestors. As a serious estimate of the state&apos;s esteem, it really won&apos;t do. \u2022\u00a0The picture caption was amended on 13 January 2014 because the original said Lino Carbosiero was now a CBE. This has been corrected to say MBE."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jan/12/labour-licensing-teachers-plan-improve-status", "sentences": ["In a speech, Hunt will outline further measures, citing methods used in Singapore, where teachers can follow different &quot;career pathways&quot; according to their interests and abilities."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-12T00:06:17Z", "title": "Labour says new licensing plan will improve status of teachers", "tags": ["Teaching", "Education", "Tristram Hunt", "Education policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Labour will set out wide-ranging plans this week to drive up standards in the teaching profession after the main unions gave a mixed response yesterday to plans to introduce a new licensing system for teachers working in state schools. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, said the relicensing of teachers every few years would allow the best to advance and the worst to be weeded out, while bringing teachers&apos; status closer to that of professions such as lawyers and doctors. In a speech, Hunt will outline further measures, citing methods used in Singapore, where teachers can follow different &quot;career pathways&quot; according to their interests and abilities. The moves show Labour wants to concentrate on teaching standards in the classroom, as opposed to what Hunt sees as the coalition government&apos;s focus on school structures. Hunt told the BBC yesterday that he wanted the &quot;enormously important&quot; role of teachers to be recognised. But he added: &quot;If you&apos;re not a motivated teacher \u2013 passionate about your subject, passionate about being in the classroom \u2013 you shouldn&apos;t really be in this profession.&quot; Teaching unions responded sceptically to the plans for regular licensing, an idea floated by the last Labour government but dropped before the 2010 general election after opposition from the unions. But Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, the largest teachers&apos; union, said that if the proposal was part of a wider plan, her members would be open to discussing it. But Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said she had serious reservations. &quot;The fact is that teachers are very highly observed. Many of our members describe themselves as being surveilled the whole time,&quot; she said. Hunt has already set dates to meet teachers&apos; unions in the near future. A Conservative party spokesman said it was willing to look at any proposals that would &quot;genuinely improve the quality of teaching&quot;. He said: &quot;We have already taken action by allowing heads to remove teachers from the classroom within one term, as opposed to within a year previously, and by scrapping the three-hour limit on classroom observations. &quot;We are improving teacher training, expanding Teach First and allowing heads to pay good teachers more. Thanks to our reforms, a record proportion of top graduates are entering the profession.

But Ghana is pressing ahead to build this $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) technology city outside the capital, Accra. Designed by OBR architects, the city will consist of six towers, including a 75-floor, 270m-tall (885ft) building, the highest in Africa, where 25,000 people will live and 50,000 will work. There have been teething problems, with the site moved to a larger one at Pampram. Residents at the original location, Dunkunaa, claim the project had incurred the displeasure of the gods when the developers refused to acknowledge the chiefs and elders of the area. That could be the least of Hope City&apos;s problems, warns Professor Vanessa Watson of the University of Cape Town. She has flagged up concern not just over the Pampram project, but over other &quot;urban fantasies&quot; involving large-scale reconfigurations of existing cities (such as Kigali in Rwanda, and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia) or the construction of satellite cities (such as Tatu, outside Nairobi in Kenya, and Kigamboni, outside Dar es Salaam in Tanzania). These new city plans are a relatively recent phenomenon, most dating from the past five or six years, with the private sector playing a dominant role in nearly all the projects. In the paper African urban fantasies: dreams or nightmares?, published by the International Institute for Environment and Development on Monday, Watson casts doubts over whether these grandiose urban projects, driven by local politicians and global investors who see Africa as the &quot;last frontier&quot;, will meet the real needs of most people. &quot;The bulk of the population in sub-Saharan African cities is extremely poor and living in informal settlements,&quot; she writes. &quot;Some of these settlements are on well-located urban land that is also attractive to property developers. Attempts to implement these fantasy plans within existing cities will (and is already) having major exclusionary effects on vulnerable low-income groups through evictions and relocations.&quot; She questions the premise on which these big projects are based: rapid urbanisation in Africa and the growth of a middle class on the continent. Watson cites studies arguing that claims of very rapid urbanisation may be overstated and rates may be higher in smaller towns. The Africa Development Bank defines the middle class as those spending $2-20 a day, and the upper middle class as spending $10-20 a day. &quot;It is difficult to imagine how households with such minimal spending power can afford the luxury apartments portrayed in the fantasy plans (as well as the vehicles needed to move around these new cities), and it may be that prospective property developers are seriously misreading the African market,&quot; she writes. As an example of an architectural white elephant, Watson cites the Chinese-built &quot;ghost towns&quot; outside the Angolan capital, Luanda \u2013 cities comprising of tower blocks of apartments selling at $150,000 to $200,000 each. Ambitious urban projects may have worked in Shanghai, China and Ho Chi Minh City, and cities such as Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore are clearly the models for the new African cities. But Watson doubts whether African governments have the capacity to pull them off. On a mundane level, she wonders how cities, invariably described as smart and sustainable and consisting of tower blocks reliant on lifts and air conditioning, can function in an environment where power cuts occur several times a day. &quot;Maybe they will be able to, but what nobody can tell me is what will happen to the people living in shack settlements in those cities,&quot; Watson says. Satellite cities are frequently justified on the basis that they are located on empty land. But it is rare, she argues, for larger cities to be empty, and if such land is not within an environmentally protected area, then it is likely to be actively farmed. &quot;In all kinds of eviction processes, landowners rarely hold land title, and full compensation for land, shelter and livelihoods is unlikely,&quot; she adds. The desire to construct fantasy cities is bound to divert scarce resources from meeting the basic services and housing needs of the much larger poor urban populations. &quot;What seems most likely is that the majority of urban populations will find themselves further disadvantaged and marginalised,&quot; writes Watson. &quot;It is access to land by the urban poor (as well as those on the urban periphery and beyond) that is most directly threatened by these processes, and access to land in turn determines to urban services, to livelihoods and citizenship.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jan/13/paul-dempsey-media-internet-bbc", "sentences": ["Before the Activate Singapore Summit 2014 on 16-17 January, Paul Dempsey, president global markets, BBC Worldwide, spoke to us about about what the open internet and growth in mobile computing mean for the future of media companies.", "A focus of the Singapore Activate event is the role of the open internet in transforming how companies do business."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-13T16:23:21Z", "title": "Paul Dempsey: 'Media companies must embrace the open internet to survive'", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Activate Singapore"], "article": "Before the Activate Singapore Summit 2014 on 16-17 January, Paul Dempsey, president global markets, BBC Worldwide, spoke to us about about what the open internet and growth in mobile computing mean for the future of media companies. Can you tell us a bit about BBC Worldwide Global Markets, and your role within the corporation?Global Markets is the term we use to describe the non-English speaking territories of the world. Essentially, it is the whole world less the UK, North America and ANZ. Our main business activities are: international distribution of finished TV programmes; the sale of TV formats; our network of 34 owned and operated BBC branded TV channels; consumer products; and brand licensing. We also have a production presence in France, Germany and India making localised versions of some of the best known BBC formats. My job, as president, is to lead all of our business activities in each of these 200-plus markets and to find and grow audiences for BBC content. We do this through our network of 16 international offices. I also have overall responsibility for major sales events such as BBC Worldwide Showcase, MIPCOM and MIPTV. How does BBC Worldwide differ from its parent company, the BBC?BBC Worldwide is the commercial arm of the BBC. We exist to support the BBC public service mission and to maximise profits on its behalf. We do this by commercialising and showcasing content from the BBC around the world. We are the biggest distributor of completed shows outside the US players. We also build the reach and reputation of the BBC brand overseas and champion British creativity. By maximising the value of BBC intellectual property, we provide investment for great new BBC programmes and help keep the licence fee as low as possible. Profit for the year 2012/2013 rose 1% to 156m. How do intend to keep profits rising, while still keeping the integrity of the BBC brand?We are very happy with our track record of delivering growth in profits year-on-year. Our strategy for growth is to invest even more into premium TV content, build brands in the genres where we enjoy a world class reputation and to invest in bbc.com as our primary direct-to-consumer digital service. And further investment in content means more and better content for our third party partners as well \u2013 a virtuous circle. We see the global markets as a rich source of future growth for us. We know audiences all over the world enjoy our shows and with the new focus we are putting on these territories, I expect the share of business that we generate in the non-English speaking world to increase significantly. The restructuring of BBC Worldwide away from separate global operating divisions to geographical lines of management will also help to deliver growth. Bringing together our sales, channels and digital businesses into integrated regional teams puts decision-making closer to our customers and allows us to respond more quickly to changing dynamics in different markets \u2013 and the markets really are different. The restructure also allows us to put more focus on fast-emerging markets in the world \u2013 particularly Latin America and Asia. Global Markets takes the format of a television programme, such as The Great British Bake Off, and helps produce localised versions. How do you ensure the format stays the same?BBC Worldwide has international format producers who work very closely with local broadcasters to develop shows while maintaining the core format points and creative vision. This doesn&apos;t always mean sticking rigidly to the format. Often, we will work with local producers to localise shows in specific territories. The ability to have some flexibility to reflect regional mores is important in creating successful shows. On the 23-26 February, BBC Global Markets is hosting the BBC Worldwide Showcase in Liverpool. How do you expect such events to be reflected in the sales and profits of 2014?Our Showcase event is a major moment in our annual calendar. Run in the UK each year for each of the last 37 years, it is the largest individual TV distributor sales market of its kind in the world. We attracted \u2013 a record \u2013 700 of our global TV sales customers to Showcase 2013 and this year we are predicting that Showcase will be even bigger and better than ever and are anticipating another record attendance. We generate more than \u00a3300m a year in sales of our programmes to third-party broadcaster and digital entertainment services. The showcase is fundamental to this success. A focus of the Singapore Activate event is the role of the open internet in transforming how companies do business. How can you utilise this change to increase profits for BBC Worldwide?The open internet and growth in mobile computing is the driving force behind commercial and cultural change around the world. Media companies willing to embrace and lead these changes will be the global brands of the future. The BBC has long known this and has led the way in taking its services digital \u2013 we were first with News Online, first with Radio Online and we led the way with digital video on iPlayer in the UK. Our innovation in these areas has led to real gain in reach both internationally and domestically. As content costs continue to increase and content becomes harder and harder to miss, media companies must embrace the open internet to survive. Over IP, the BBC can be a truly global brand giving audiences direct access to content we know they will like. The internet presents very exciting opportunities for BBC Worldwide in mature markets like the UK, North America and Australia; it also allows us to leapfrog the traditional linear TV world in other markets, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. There are many more mobile phones in Africa than there are TV sets, for example. Now that&apos;s exciting. The internet challenges us to behave more like a startup to find audiences in new ways. To succeed, we have got to be more consumer-focused \u2026 our consumers are becoming more demanding of what, when and how they consume content and we have got to listen to them in every market we operate in.

But now vice-chancellors have evidence to back up their case, with the publication on Monday of an interim report by the British Educational Research Association (Bera) and Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce on the role of research in teacher education. While the policy implications of the findings will only be spelled out in the full report, due out in March, it highlights the fact that in other countries there has been a shift away from school-based training and towards university-based teacher education in institutions with relatively high entrance standards and status. It suggests that the education systems that perform best and have improved most, such as in Finland and Singapore, put particular emphasis on research training for teachers. John Furlong, professor of education at Oxford University and chair of the steering group behind the report, says: &quot;There is strong evidence that research is important in the best-quality teacher education programmes around the world in at least four different ways: it underpins the knowledge communicated to teachers; teachers need preliminary research skills in order to be able to start thinking about their own work; it helps explain how people develop professionally; and, built into programmes, it monitors what programmes are doing, making sure they are staying up to date with the latest developments about how professionals learn.&quot; Chris Husbands, director of the Institute of Education, says the decision to transfer responsibility for teacher training in England away from universities to schools flies in the face of findings on best practice internationally. &quot;In Singapore, the government is clear: the improvements in teacher training since a low point of low morale and shortages in the 1980s have been driven by improving teacher training through the National Institute of Education,&quot; he says. &quot;I was in Singapore working for the government a few weeks ago and no one could believe what we are doing in terms of de-regulation.&quot; Joy Carter, vice-chancellor of the University of Winchester, where 12% of entry for 2013-14 was for initial teacher training, says the potential effect of the changes on teacher quality is particularly worrying given the relatively poor performance of British schoolchildren shown in figures published last month by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, comparing standards in maths, reading and science. &quot;If the quality of teaching plummets any further we are in trouble as a country,&quot; she says. A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents 132 higher education institutions, more than half of which are involved in teacher training, says it is raising concerns &quot;at the highest levels&quot; about implementation of the School Direct scheme introduced two years ago, and will discuss the implications of the Bera report with its members. Analysis by UUK for 2014/15 shows that allocations for postgraduate training in HE institutions have been reduced by more than 18% to 16,342, while School Direct allocations have increased by nearly 60% to 15,254. This means 37% of all initial teacher-training places are now allocated to School Direct, up from 25% last year. Drawing on a survey of universities involved in teacher training, the analysis highlights concerns about a potential shortage of trained teachers in some subjects and particular parts of the country. Maths, modern foreign languages, physics and design and technology are way below their recruitment targets this year. But many universities have also expressed concerns about a possible future shortage of English teachers, in which allocations for training places have been slashed. UUK understands that only 14 English trainees have been allocated to the whole of Sheffield. It also reports worries about reduced allocations for primary-school training places at postgraduate level. James Noble-Rogers, executive director of the University Council for the Education of Teachers (Ucet), says this is a worry because of increased pupil numbers in primary schools. This bubble will soon hit secondary schools, he warns, while at the same time, fewer people are likely to turn to teaching because of more opportunities in other sectors. &quot;It is a bit reckless for the government to introduce such a huge change when demographics are coming up and we are coming out of recession,&quot; he says. While Ucet is not opposed to the principle of School Direct, he says, &quot;the problem we are having is that it has been expanded far too quickly&quot;. Both the Open University and Bath University have recently decided to close their PGCE courses, citing uncertainty caused by the changes as a factor. The concern is that others will follow suit. Bob Burgess, vice-chancellor of the University of Leicester and chair of the UUK/Guild HE Teacher Education Advisory Group, says that even if universities do not immediately stop teacher training, they may be forced to cut down in particular subject areas or in training teachers for particular age groups and that could eventually &quot;nibble away&quot; at the whole system of teacher training in universities. &quot;The model clearly assumes that universities will be there so that schools can draw on their expertise,&quot; he says. &quot;But you need to have enough money fuelling that.&quot; Carter says all universities with any form of teacher training are worried about the changes because they make it much harder to plan for future demand. Already, she says, applications to university teacher training are substantially down this year for the first time in decades, which, she suggests, could be the result of over-marketing of School Direct places at the expense of higher education-based courses, combined with applicants being wary of new basic skills tests for trainee teachers. An added worry is that the School Direct scheme was less successful than universities in filling the places allocated to it last year. &quot;We cannot afford for that to happen again this year,&quot; says John Howson, managing director of the research company Data for Education and a former government adviser on teacher supply. &quot;If this is going to be a credible training route for large numbers of teachers then schools have to play their part in filling those places.&quot; Since there has as yet been no evaluation of the School Direct scheme and little data on its effect on teacher-training numbers, he suggests it is being expanded too rapidly. This means, says Burgess, &quot;there is a risk to the future training of teachers, there is a risk in terms of schools having a supply of appropriately trained teachers, and I also think there is a risk to the way teachers are trained. There needs to be a place for universities in that training because universities bestow, in any qualification, a concept of professionalism&quot;. But an education department spokesperson says: &quot;School Direct is a response to what schools had said they want \u2013 a greater role in selecting and recruiting trainees with the potential to be outstanding teachers. The programme is only in its second full year of operating and it is already proving very popular, allowing heads to pick and choose the very brightest graduates and actually raise teaching standards.&quot; He says that last year, three candidates applied for every School Direct place, compared with 1.8 applicants per place in universities; requests from schools for School Direct places have gone up from 9,600 to 17,700 in the past year and 99% of the overall target for postgraduate places through schools and universities were filled."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/14/bankers-charged-us-fix-libor", "sentences": ["Robson worked as a senior trader on Rabobank\u2019s money markets desk in London; Thompson was the bank&apos;s head of money market and derivatives trading in Singapore; while Motomura was a senior trader at Rabobank\u2019s Tokyo desk, according to court papers.", "\u201cThese three traders \u2014 working from Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom \u2014 deliberately submitted what they called \u2018obscenely high\u2019 or \u2018silly low\u2019 Libor rates in order to benefit their own trading positions,\u201d acting assistant US attorney general Mythili Raman said in a statement."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-14T07:10:28Z", "title": "Three Rabobank traders charged in US with five-year plot to fix Libor", "tags": ["Business", "Libor", "Banking", "UK news", "US news", "Americas"], "article": "Three former Rabobank traders have been charged in the US with engaging in a five-year scheme to manipulate benchmark interest rates as international probes of rate rigging escalate. Paul Robson, a Briton, Paul Thompson, an Australian, Tetsuya Motomura of Japan were charged on Monday with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud, as well as two counts of wire fraud, according to a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court. None of the men are in US custody, a court official said. From about May 2006 to January 2011, it is alleged that the three men and unidentified \u201cothers\u201d at the Dutch bank \u201cagreed to make false and fraudulent yen Libor submissions for the benefit of their trading positions&apos;&apos;, according to the government. If convicted, each of the three defendants faces as long as 30 years in prison. Robson worked as a senior trader on Rabobank\u2019s money markets desk in London; Thompson was the bank&apos;s head of money market and derivatives trading in Singapore; while Motomura was a senior trader at Rabobank\u2019s Tokyo desk, according to court papers. \u201cThese three traders \u2014 working from Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom \u2014 deliberately submitted what they called \u2018obscenely high\u2019 or \u2018silly low\u2019 Libor rates in order to benefit their own trading positions,\u201d acting assistant US attorney general Mythili Raman said in a statement. Global fines on companies including Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc reached $US6bn in December, and authorities around the world are investigating the alleged abuse of financial benchmarks by companies that play a central role in setting them. Regulators are still examining traders at half a dozen more firms. Robson coordinated his yen Libor submission with the trader responsible for making the Libor position at another bank on behalf of co-defendants, the US alleged. The US also said the unidentified trader who conspired with the three defendants was a \u201csenior trader\u201d for Rabobank\u2019s money market unit in Tokyo. The US said Robson made a higher or lower yen Libor submission \u201cconsistent with the direction requested by a defendant and consistent with the co-defendant\u2019s trading position\u201d. These manipulated Libor submissions were frequently to the detriment of Rabobank\u2019s counterparties to derivative contracts, as alleged by the US. The US complaint includes excerpts of e-mails, instant messages and calls that were recorded by the bank which the three defendants exchanged. In one exchange on May 10, 2006, Robson said in an e-mail \u201cit must be pretty embarrassing to set such a low libor. I was very embarrassed to set my 6 mth--but wanted to help thomo\u201d in what the US prosecutors says was a reference to Thompson. In a May 19, 2006, email, Thompson informed Robson that his net exposure for his three-month fixes was 125bn yen and stated \u201csneak your 3 m libor down a cheeky 1 or 2 bp\u201d because \u201cit will make a bit of diff for me.\u201d Robson responded that same day stating, \u201cNo prob mate I mark it low.\u201d In an exchange on August 4, 2008, Motomura asked Robson, \u201cPlease set today\u2019s 6mth LIBOR at 0.96 I have a chunky fixing\u201d. In an telephone call on 30 October, 2007, that was recorded by the bank, Robson asked Motomura: \u201cDo you want me to set anything for you?,\u201d to which Motomura replied that same day, \u201cif it is lower, it\u2019s better for me\u201d asking for a \u201clow 6\u2019s please&apos;&apos;. Rates under investigation include the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and ISDAfix, used to determine the value of interest-rate derivatives. The rates are used by banks to determine the cost of borrowing for businesses, home-buyers and students. European regulators also have reviewed allegations of collusion in crude oil and biofuels markets. Regulators from Switzerland to Washington are examining evidence reported by Bloomberg News in June that currency traders have been manipulating spot foreign-exchange rates for at least a decade, affecting the value of funds and derivatives. Those inquiries look at benchmark WM/Reuters rates, which are determined by trades executed in a minute-long period called \u201cthe fix\u201d at 4 p.m. in London each day. Probes of benchmark rates are prompting financial firms to overhaul internal controls and business practices, such as by reining their employees\u2019 use of electronic chat rooms. In November, foreign-exchange dealers from the world\u2019s biggest banks told the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that inquiries in their market could prompt an overhaul of the way they handle customer orders. The US alleged the three former Rabobank employees traded in derivative products that referenced yen Libor. Rabobank on 29 October entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the US justice department as part of its investigation in benchmarks including Libor and agreed to pay a $325m penalty. A spokeswoman for Rabobank declined to comment on Monday. The US Libor probe has led to criminal charges against eight individuals and resulted in more than $3.7bn in penalties paid to law enforcement and regulatory agencies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/14/manchester-united-share-price-david-moyes-premier-league", "sentences": ["The initial public offering (IPO), originally planned for Singapore but then switched to New York and leading to the club&apos;s incorporation in the Cayman Islands, was the latest in a series of moves that repackaged, sliced, diced and refinanced the debt that the Glazers had incurred to buy the club in the first place."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-14T14:56:18Z", "title": "Manchester United's share price mirrors form under David Moyes | Owen Gibson", "tags": ["Manchester United", "The Glazer family", "David Moyes", "Sir Alex Ferguson", "Finances", "Business", "Financial fair play", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "In the Premier League era, it is often hard to tell where the financial section finishes and the sports pages begin. The line between the two has not so much blurred as collapsed. So as relentless scrutiny of his transfers, tactics and team selections has intensified the pressure on David Moyes, so the effect of Manchester United&apos;s lacklustre form on their Wall Street share price has been reported as though enunciated by Charlotte Green. It stood on Tuesday at $15.16, only three cents above its 12-month low, as it continued its drift from a high of more than $19 in the heady days of May as United celebrated their 20th championship. That slide, which has wiped $250m off United&apos;s overall value in a little over six months, has refocused scrutiny on the business model and future intentions of the American family that have bitterly divided fans throughout their ownership. Since the Glazers surprised some analysts by persuading investors to pay $14 a share for a 10% stake in the club on Wall St in August 2012, at a price lower than that initially hoped for but still considered high given the lack of voting rights they conferred, that figure has fluctuated. It initially dipped sharply below the offer level, and hit a low of $12.18 in September 2012, before beginning a steady climb and reaching a high of $19.04 on 2 May as Sir Alex Ferguson celebrated his last, and arguably greatest, achievement in squeezing the last drops from a squad that was creaking at the seams (not to mention their joints). The announcement of his retirement sparked an immediate fall, followed by a recovery into autumn as the club announced healthy financial results that underlined the further potential for revenue growth. It then fell sharply from mid-December onwards, coinciding with a fresh wave of concern over the Moyes era. The initial public offering (IPO), originally planned for Singapore but then switched to New York and leading to the club&apos;s incorporation in the Cayman Islands, was the latest in a series of moves that repackaged, sliced, diced and refinanced the debt that the Glazers had incurred to buy the club in the first place. It is only in hindsight that the huge debt they owed Ferguson, who saw no contradiction between his socialist Govan shop steward roots and the product of global capitalism that United became, has truly become clear. Not only did his spat with the Coolmore mafia effectively usher in their takeover bid but his steadfast support in the face of massed fan protest and his insistence that he was never refused money for transfers did much to solidify their tenure when it was tottering. And that is before you consider the feat of alchemy he performed by maintaining a winning streak on a relative shoestring. In doing so he arguably left behind a heap of trouble for his successor, exacerbated by the failure of new vice-chairman Ed Woodward to land the sort of statement signings required to usher in a new era. Yet it was Ferguson&apos;s genius, combined with the acumen of Woodward in minting a commercial model that has become a juggernaut, that allowed the Glazers to pilot a course through a series of risky financial manoeuvres that blogger Andy Green has calculated will have cost the club more than \u00a31bn in fees and interest by 2016. While picturing what sort of club they may have become under alternative ownership is inevitably an exercise in guesswork, what United might have done with that money instead will always remain the biggest stain on the Glazer era. Football clubs are notoriously hard to value because they are not like any other business. Nor is it easy to disentangle the fluctuations in United&apos;s share price from wider market conditions and it would be wrong to draw a direct line between results on the pitch and the graphs on traders&apos; screens. But any sensible investor will be keeping a concerned eye on what Ferguson&apos;s departure means for the Glazer model, the level of investment likely to be required and what a period of relative underachievement on the pitch \u2013 and, in particular, an absence from the Champions League of more than a season \u2013 might do for revenue forecasts. United&apos;s financial predictions are based on the club finishing third in the league and reaching the quarter-finals of cup competitions \u2013 which looks like an ambitious target at this juncture. As does the promise, made at the time of the IPO, that annual net transfer spend would continue to average \u00a325m to \u00a330m a year. At at time when the need to rebuild the squad looks more urgent with every passing day, significantly more than that may be required. Nor is it quite right to say the Glazers are paying little attention to the share price fluctuations \u2013 they will be monitoring them keenly. In the short term, any plans they may have had to float further tranches of shares and cash out, while retaining overall control, will surely have to be paused until a more attractive &quot;narrative&quot; emerges. Following the float, the best guess at the future intentions of the ever-silent Glazers \u2013 having weathered the riskiest point of their debt-funded model and the stormiest fan protests \u2013 was that they would sit back and continue to cash in batches of shares, under no pressure to sell unless they received a ludicrous offer. Clouds of uncertainty over the future put that vision at risk. At the same time, some of the wilder talk of the last few weeks that the Glazers might be spooked into drastic action by a fall in the share price are also well wide of the mark. Beyond this period of instability, they still believe \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 that they have only begun to scratch the surface of a model that will yield further growth and see themselves as long-term owners. Gazing west to the US and east to China, and mindful of the potential of technology, they can see further riches even beyond the $1bn they hope for from Nike for a new kit deal and the $559m Chevy shirt sponsorship contract. Meanwhile, they hope financial fair play and rising broadcasting income will further lock in their natural advantage. The contrast between the gloom surrounding United&apos;s performances on the pitch and the upbeat announcement last week of their latest global partner, drinks brand Aperol, was striking. Yet if the rewards of success dry up, all the romance and history of the United &quot;brand&quot; will not stop partners looking to Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich instead. It is only then that you might expect change to be considered in the dugout. For now, Old Trafford insiders preach patience, point to Moyes&apos;s six-year contract and insist he will be given the time and money to drastically reshape his squad in the summer. Those hoping the Glazers, considering the task at hand, will falter in their determination not to sell are likely to be disappointed. Yet as any student of small print knows, if there is one certainty that links the stock market and the league table it is that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Just as it is too early to judge the Moyes era on the pitch, so it will only become clear in time whether the fluctuations in United&apos;s share price are merely a temporary blip or a harbinger of longer-term flux."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/14/school-curriculum-review-conservative-panellist-hits-back-at-critics", "sentences": ["He said curricula in better performing countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Finland were often 15 to 20 pages whereas Australia\u2019s curriculum documents were like a \u201ctelephone book\u201d."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-14T21:14:13Z", "title": "School curriculum review panellist Kevin Donnelly hits back at critics", "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics"], "article": "A conservative education commentator reviewing the national curriculum has hit back at \u201cvitriolic\u201d attacks on his credentials, arguing he would be \u201cnear the top of the list\u201d of people best qualified to examine the issue. Kevin Donnelly - who will join public policy academic Ken Wiltshire in reviewing what is taught in schools \u2013 said he was not seeking to overturn the national curriculum and replace it with \u201can ideological conservative one\u201d. An open letter to the education minister, Christopher Pyne, signed by 176 educators, has noted that the two panellists were highly critical of the national curriculum and questioned whether they would \u201chold the requisite openness to diverse views and perspectives required to produce a balanced and fair review\u201d. Interviewed on ABC radio on Tuesday, Donnelly argued that the central focus of the review commissioned by the federal government would be to find ways to raise standards and ease the burden on teachers, rather than addressing claims of left-wing bias in the national curriculum. Pyne announced the appointment of Donnelly and Wiltshire on Friday, setting a June deadline for a review that would in part consider concerns that the curriculum downplayed western civilisation, the Anzac story and the role of conservative prime ministers while placing excessive focus on unions and the Labor party. Groups representing parents and teachers told Guardian Australia on Monday the review was premature because the national curriculum was yet to be fully implemented in all states and territories. The Tasmanian education minister, Nick McKim, denounced the choice of Donnelly and Wiltshire, saying the review had \u201call the hallmarks of a brainwashing and propaganda mission to let Mr Pyne impose his extreme right-wing views on Australian students\u201d. On Tuesday, Pyne defended Donnelly and Wiltshire as \u201cexcellent appointments\u201d and said everyone who had been to school had a view about education. &quot;Whomever had been appointed, there would be criticism of their particular views. I think both men will do a very objective job and make sure that our curriculum is the best in the world. There&apos;s no reason we should settle for second best,\u201d Pyne said at a media conference in Canberra. He said results had declined over the past 30 years while a &quot;particular education establishment&quot; had been &quot;in power&quot; and it was &quot;time for some fresh eyes&quot;. Donnelly singled out Ken Boston, a former head of the NSW education department and member of the Gonski review panel, for making a \u201cvitriolic personal attack\u201d on his integrity. Boston told the ABC on Friday that Wiltshire was \u201ca serious academic\u201d for whom he had \u201ca great deal of respect\u201d but Donnelly had a history of voicing ill-considered and uninformed views. Boston said Donnelly launched \u201cattacks on anyone who disagrees with him as being members of the cultural left and that includes the leaders of education in each of the states, teachers, the Fairfax press and most recently, the ABC\u201d. \u201cHe is not taken seriously. He doesn&apos;t engage with reasoned argument or evidence. His views or rantings, frankly, are well known and have been disregarded for many years,\u201d Boston said. Donnelly said: \u201cI was talking to my daughter the other day and she was looking at some of the tweets in the Twittersphere and some of the emails going around and she heard some of Ken Boston\u2019s quite vitriolic personal attack on my professional integrity and qualifications on the ABC radio ... and she was appalled. The reality is I taught for 18 years, I have a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate in curriculum studies, I\u2019ve undertaken three benchmarking projects in Australia and New Zealand; if there\u2019s anybody qualified to look at curriculum then I think I\u2019d have to be near the top of the list.\u201d Donnelly downplayed his former role as a chief of staff to the Liberal minister Kevin Andrews, saying he performed that job \u201cfor about a year\u201d, but education was his \u201cfirst love\u201d and the review would be independent. \u201cYou can get involved in the hurly-burly of the day-to-day political debate but at the same time in such an important and significant review as this you can be objective and balanced; and that\u2019s why the whole process will be quite transparent, there are terms of reference, there\u2019s a web page, anybody can put in a submission and they will be duly read and noted.\u201d Donnelly said the review was needed because student performance in literacy, numeracy, mathematics and science was declining or flatlining. He said he and Wiltshire would consult state and territory governments \u2013 whose support would be crucial to implementing the recommendations \u2013 and \u201ceducation experts from around Australia\u201d. In an opinion piece in Fairfax newspapers on Tuesday, Donnelly denied the claims of critics that the review\u2019s outcomes were predetermined. But he repeated his concerns with the emphasis of the three cross-curriculum priorities: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures; Asia and Australia\u2019s engagement with Asia; and sustainability. \u201cNow, that\u2019s a good thing, but I\u2019d argue the pendulum has moved too far towards that kind of approach and we really need to balance that with an understanding that our political, our legal institutions are derived from western civilisation, so I think children need good grounding in that,\u201d Donnelly told the ABC. \u201cGeographically we\u2019re part of Asia; I\u2019ve got no problem with that. Our Indigenous people need to be respected; their story has to be told, but equally I would argue that the history of this nation, its legal and political institutions in particular, can only be understood in terms of that western narrative.\u201d As highlighted by a Guardian Australia analysis on Friday, the national curriculum includes a module in Year 6 history on Australia as a Nation focused on \u201ckey figures and events that led to Australia\u2019s Federation, including British and American influences on Australia\u2019s system of law and government\u201d. It talks about \u201cidentifying key elements of Australia\u2019s system of law and government and their origins (for example the Magna Carta; federalism; constitutional monarchy; the Westminster system and the separation of powers \u2013 legislature, executive, judiciary; the houses of parliament; how laws are made)\u201d. The open letter to Pyne raises concerns about the framing of the review as removing partisan bias from the curriculum. It says the lengthy development of the national curriculum \u201cinvolved contributions from thousands of stakeholders, including teachers and other educators, students, and parents and community members\u201d and was negotiated with state and territory governments of various political persuasions. Its signatories include Professor Peter Renshaw, head of the school of education at the University of Queensland; Garry Collins, president of the Australian Association for the Teaching of English; Dr David Zyngier, senior lecturer in curriculum and pedagogy at Monash University; and Dr Maggie Clarke, senior lecturer at the University of Western Sydney. \u201cWhilst it is true that some commentators have raised voices about alleged &apos;bias&apos; and inadequacies in the curriculum, these critiques have come from &apos;left&apos; as well as &apos;right&apos; and most who have put work into, and engaged with, the new curriculum so far \u2013 in schools, state governments and universities \u2013 do not see a strong bias in either direction,\u201d the open letter says. The letter describes the timing of the review as \u201chighly disruptive\u201d to students and teachers because not all states and territories had completed full implementation of the curriculum from foundation to year 10 in English, history, mathematics and science. The suggestion that changes could be made in time for the 2015 school year \u201cdemonstrates a lack of understanding of the processes of thoughtful planning that classroom implementation requires on the part of schools and teachers and a gross misunderstanding of teachers\u2019 work\u201d. On Tuesday the Council of Catholic School Parents NSW issued a statement warning that a comprehensive review of the curriculum content may &quot;undermine the confidence of teachers, senior students and parents at a critical time in the implementation phase&quot;. Donnelly said he aimed to perform the review from the perspective of the classroom and making it easier for teachers, particularly in primary school, \u201cwho are drowned, inundated, with a curriculum that can be very prescriptive, can be very top-heavy\u201d. He said curricula in better performing countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Finland were often 15 to 20 pages whereas Australia\u2019s curriculum documents were like a \u201ctelephone book\u201d. \u201cAt the end of the day I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to overturn the national curriculum, write an ideological conservative one. What we will be doing is \u2026 trying to look at issues about standards, about rigour, about how better-performing countries teach the curriculum and what we can do to make it easier for teachers and hopefully raise standards for children.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2014/jan/15/citizenship-lesson-pens-paper-teach-digital-citizens", "sentences": ["Holly is an English language arts teacher in Singapore who loves paper and computers equally."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-15T16:30:00Z", "title": "My best citizenship lesson: using paper blogs to teach international digital citizens", "tags": ["Citizenship", "Teacher Network", "Education", "Teacher survey", "English and creative writing"], "article": "The idea of citizenship is in constant flux, just as the notion of what it means to be literate in the 21st century is also evolving. Viewed under the cultural and global lens required of international school citizens, the definition is even harder to pin down. Teachers in international schools bring a myriad of ideologies and cultural understandings which present opportunity and dichotomy for their school community. Rich and fertile in breadth of experience and belief, their knowledge and cultural understandings can be at cross-purposes with the culture of the country, which again might be different to the culture of the school. In international schools, the nature of what we teach as citizenship is arbitrary, and individual schools decide how to address the subject. One form of citizenship that needs particular attention is that of digital citizenship. Many international schools deliver lessons using technology; students are constantly operating in the digital realm and are out there in a global sense. A major focus for many international schools has to be transferring the idea of citizenship from face-to-face behaviours to screen-to-screen behaviours. But we have to be aware that technology is primarily used by school-aged children for entertainment purposes and they won&apos;t perceive them as educational just because they&apos;re in a classroom. This means we have to explicitly teach them how to operate safely, successfully and ethically online. In my classroom, I find that blogs are a great way to address digital citizenship. Blogs offer students the opportunity to create an online portfolio that documents success, progress and achievement. More significantly, it provides them with an authentic audience, which is a great motivator in terms of language use, length and quality of work produced. As an English teacher, I set up blogs with my students to showcase their writing, and I emphasise the need to create a positive online persona. I teach my &quot;Snapshot&quot;&apos; unit to year seven students on entry into secondary school. The big question underpinning the unit is: &quot;How do I present who I am to the world?&quot; The final outcome is a reflective learning blog that they use throughout their time in school. I begin using analogue tools. We learn what blogging is and how it can help our learning \u2013 but on paper. We create a paper blogging community that mimics the digital realm, and allows students to learn about safe and ethical behaviours before going online. Students begin by writing a draft blog about a favourite food or drink on paper. They then move around the room according to whether their food is hot or cold. This demonstrates tagging or labels, which is really important as it allows them to document and search for their work effectively for comparison and progression. Students then &quot;publish&quot; their work by creating a neatly decorated paper post that includes their text, a referenced image, a title and tags. Once their posts are ready, students lay them all on the floor. We talk about comments and how this is an integral part of a blog when it comes to learning because it&apos;s like peer assessment. We talk about how to be helpful but critical friends who offer ways to improve, not just mean or nasty comments. Students are then asked to take away another&apos;s blog, read it carefully and then write a comment on a sticky note and stick it to the bottom. They are to write something positive, as well as a suggestion for improvement, and return it to the front. We repeat this a few times so each post has a couple of comments on it. While this is going on, I whisper to a few students and ask them to write something deliberately mean, unpleasant and unhelpful. After each blog has at least two sticky notes on, we all gather together at the front, where students collect and read the comments. Almost immediately some indignant and upset students will storm up to me pointing at the deliberately mean comment, upon which I ask them to read it aloud, and then ask the class, &quot;Is this helpful?&quot; This leads into a discussion about trolls and how to deal with them. It also leads to a discussion about ownership of the blog. I ask the student if they want to keep the comment, to which they always answer no. I tell them to take it off, rip it up and put it in the bin. I reinforce the idea of ownership by saying that they have control of their blogs at all times and can remove any comments that are unkind or deliberately mean. They finish by checking their work against the rubric, editing and finishing as needed and then &quot;publishing&quot; by sticking up on the outside of the classroom. Sticky notes are left outside with the paper blogs and the school is informed so that comments from the whole community can be made. Students are encouraged to check their posts regularly and remove unwanted comments. Finally, they write a reflection on their learning from the paper blogging project. A set of guidelines is then sent home, which students read and sign with parents/carers. Only once this is returned can they set up a live blog, which becomes an e-portfolio for all their best English work. Even if teaching with technology doesn&apos;t happen in every school yet, many students&apos; social interactions do. Without doubt, at least some form of our students&apos; future jobs will be conducted digitally, meaning all educators have a responsibility to address digital citizenship. But we need to explicitly teach them how to behave ethically and responsibly by providing plenty of opportunities to actively and safely experiment and learn how to be open-minded, responsible digital citizens.

Ars\u00e8ne Wenger&apos;s side came close to doing something similar in Monday night&apos;s 2-1 victory at Villa Park, but the resilient backbone they have developed over the last 18 months held firm. Much of the credit for that has gone to Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny at centre-back (unbeaten as a pair in the league since January 2012), but it&apos;s a different emphasis throughout the team that&apos;s really making the difference. Wenger&apos;s best teams may be remembered for their passing and their flair, but it&apos;s the hard defensive work of Mathieu Flamini, Mikel Arteta, Olivier Giroud, Jack Wilshere, and even Mesut \u00d6zil that is allowing Arsenal to close out the narrow wins that in past years have eluded them. Fulham may never have won at the Gunners in their history \u2013 in any competition \u2013 but they have managed draws in the last two seasons at the Emirates, so this match provides Arsenal with ample opportunity to demonstrate the change they have undergone and the growth that has taken them to the top of the table.  \u2022 Paul Wilson on Arsenal&apos;s new-found grit\u2022 Fulham have bid rejected for Ravel Morrison  2) Pulis&apos; quest for points is crystal clear in Stoke reunion  Tony Pulis should be hailed by Stoke fans as a hero. The man who guided the club from mid-table Championship status to Premier League stalwarts, who took them to an FA Cup Final, who signed Ricardo Fuller. The football may not have been attractive, but it was effective \u2013 they were never a soft touch, and the lowest top-flight finish was 14th. However, it&apos;s not that simple. That stolid style of play, coupled with a large outlay on transfers and wages, left fans disgruntled and there were few tears shed when he was shown the door at the end of last season. Mark Hughes was appointed to unpick the conservative tactics \u2013 which was more than apparent in the helter-skelter 5-3 loss to Liverpool last week \u2013 but it&apos;s proving an arduous task. Meanwhile, Pulis has taken charge at Crystal Palace, and will face his old team for the first time on Saturday. Will the travelling support cheer? Will they jeer? Palace may be languishing at the bottom of the table, but a win could well lift them out of the relegation zone, and will put them just two points behind Stoke. One can&apos;t imagine there&apos;ll be any gratitude shown by the visitors for Pulis&apos;s long service if they travel back to the Potteries without all three points.  \u2022 From office to Premier League, the rise of Jedinak\u2022 John Guidetti signs for Stoke on loan  3) Hughton receives dreaded vote of confidence Now Chris Hughton has received the dreaded vote of confidence how much longer can he last? It&apos;s unclear what the Norwich chief executive, David McNally, hoped to achieve with his interview on BBC Radio Norfolk \u2013 but his words did have distinct element of menace about them. &quot;The brief for Chris was to keep us out of the bottom three \u2013 we&apos;re not in the bottom three,&quot; which of course begs the question what happens when they are in the bottom three? &quot;In any position at the football club, if you don&apos;t produce results then ultimately that&apos;s how you&apos;ll be measured. Are we disappointed this year with performances? Yes. Are we disappointed we are 15th in the league? Yes ... Clearly the results haven&apos;t been what we&apos;d like.&quot; Not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it? And, of course, that drop into the relegation zone could happen this weekend if they come a cropper against Hull City. What then? Norwich haven&apos;t done much business in the transfer window \u2013 Jon\u00e1s Gutti\u00e9rrez has arrived on loan, but there have been no permanent additions, which seems at odds with McNally&apos;s insistence on the primacy of Premier League survival. &quot;We would not contemplate relegation at our club,&quot; says the chief executive. &quot;In a sporting sense, it&apos;s worse than death. We are absolutely focused on making sure this great club stays in the Premier League.&quot; So might the club be waiting to see if Hughton is still in charge before freeing up significant funds to secure their top-flight status?  \u2022 Hull City agree deal for Shane Long\u2022 Chris Hughton must steer clear of the drop zone  4) Holt ready to make villains of doubters  Aston Villa&apos;s home record may be woeful, seven losses in 11 games is relegation form, but the results away from Villa Park have been much stronger \u2013 and with a 3-1 win on their last trip to Anfield Paul Lambert will be hopeful of an upset against Liverpool. The Villa fans may not have been too happy with the loan signing of Grant Holt, but the introduction of the hefty No9 to support Christian Benteke could be a masterstroke. Lambert&apos;s youthful set-up means that his gaggle of promising players don&apos;t have anybody to look up to, or learn from \u2013 their most experienced attacker is Gabriel Agbonlahor and at 27, and still infuriatingly inconsistent, he isn&apos;t well placed to act as anybody&apos;s mentor. Holt on the other hand has a wealth of experience, from Singapore, to non-league, to the Premier League, he&apos;s been witness to the vagaries of footballing fortune \u2013 and that sort of old head could be just what the dressing room needs. It also shouldn&apos;t be forgotten that in his last top-flight outing he scored against Manchester City at the Etihad \u2013 no mean feat \u2013 and he&apos;s even got previous at Anfield. A goal there again on Saturday will soon change the doubters minds.  \u2022 Grant Holt joins Aston Villa on loan\u2022 Liverpool land Dunkin&apos; Donuts deal  5) Saints face test of nerve Since the controversial departure of Nigel Adkins Southampton had seemed a model club. A promising young manager, a supportive chairman, an owner willing to inject cash for signings \u2013 everything was going swimmingly. But now Nicola Cortese, the chairman, and man who convinced Mauricio Pochettino of the charms of the south coast club, has left suddenly due to disagreements with the owner, Katharina Liebherr. In theory, this shouldn&apos;t have much impact on the pitch \u2013 what do players care who signs their pay cheque? However, when the manager has felt moved in the past to make such bald statements as: &quot;Basically, my future in Southampton has to be with Nicola,&quot; and Luke Shaw welcomed the news by saying he was &quot;gutted&quot; it is clear that it&apos;s going to cause some upheaval. Pochettino may have moved to quell the whispers, but if some doubt over his or the squad&apos;s future remains then Sunderland must take advantage of any hesitance within the Southampton ranks. Their style relies upon hard work, pressing, closing the space \u2013 if any of the players slack off it can fall apart, and Gus Poyet&apos;s side will have an opportunity to secure some vital points in their fight against relegation.  \u2022 Pochettino says he is committed to Southampton\u2022 Gus Poyet plans to take advantage of a club in turmoil  6) West Ham must quell anger over Morrison West Ham are said to be furious over Fulham&apos;s alleged tapping up of Ravel Morrison \u2013 so much so that they&apos;re willing to report them to the Football Association. It&apos;s bad enough that they face losing one of the few bright spots in their otherwise disappointing campaign, but to lose the young English midfielder to a relegation rival is clearly too much to bear. But might the owners have been better advised to let the injustice slide, and instead set about renegotiating Morrison&apos;s contract, if indeed they are so keen to keep him? When Arsenal successfully charged Chelsea and Jos\u00e9 Mourinho of tapping up Ashley Cole in 2005 it resulted in record fines for the Blues, Mourinho but also Arsenal&apos;s own player. Come the end of the season not only did they finish second behind champions Chelsea in the league table, but they also saw Cole depart for Stamford Bridge a year later,disgruntled now not just by the &quot;derisory&quot; \u00a360,000-per-week contract offer, but the hefty fine he&apos;d been forced to pay to the FA. Did the furore distract Arsenal? Was Ashley Cole performing under-par for the remainder of his time at the club in part because of the \u00a375,000 fine levied? It&apos;s impossible to know for sure, but if there is a lesson to be learned it&apos;s surely that teams are better off focusing on their own affairs, and not things that are out of their hands. Clubs will always tap up talent that interests them, agents will always seek larger contracts for their clients, and players will always have their heads turned by the next big offer. West Ham cannot afford distractions, they must concentrate on reinforcing the squad and staying in the Premier League, and beating Newcastle on Saturday, rather than petty, lose-lose squabbles with the teams around them.  \u2022 Lacina Traor\u00e9 granted work permit for West Ham move\u2022 FA sends a warning letter to Alan Pardew  7) City goal machine rolls into town 99 goals and counting. Manchester City may not be at the top of the league, but at home, at least, they appear unstoppable. There was a little wobble in Newcastle, but a helping hand from the referee saw them victorious, and the 5-0 mauling of Blackburn meant it was business as usual for City \u2013 with the added bonus of the return to fitness of Sergio Ag\u00fcero. Manuel Pellegrini may not want to be led into describing his attacking trio as the best in Europe, but he&apos;s happy to sing the praises of a strikeforce which is the envy of the league. And that&apos;s without the highly-rated Stevan Jovetic, injured for most of the season, but now returning to fitness . It&apos;s a huge ask of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer&apos;s Cardiff team to halt them in their tracks and delay the century celebrations \u2013 they&apos;ve managed five clean sheets all season, and only two of those were away from home, against Stoke and Norwich. Peter Crouch and Gary Hooper may have their fans, but they&apos;re hardly Ag\u00fcero and Dzeko. Solskjaer&apos;s already a United legend of course, and if he were to match Malky Mackay&apos;s early-season victory over City this Saturday he would go a long way to cementing himself in the affections of the South Wales faithful too.  \u2022 Pellegrini hails free-scoring City\u2022 Cardiff chase Ravel Morrison and Wilfried Zaha  8) Sherwood must play tactical game to nullify Swans Swansea may have lost to Manchester United last Saturday, but they did enjoy 61% of the possession, with their three central midfielders able to take control in the middle of the pitch. With a bit more incision it could have proved another bad weekend for David Moyes. At Tottenham, Tim Sherwood is persisting with his switch to a 4-4-2 \u2013 allowing Roberto Soldado some much-needed support up front. However, while this may work against the lower placed teams, and when matching up against teams set up in a similar fashion, it seems likely to leave Spurs exposed against sides that overload the midfield. Arsenal have rarely had such a comfortable ride in the north London derby as they did in their FA Cup third round tie, with Sherwood unwilling \u2013 or unable \u2013 to compromise his vision in order to combat their midfield three. If he shows the same stubborn streak against Michael Laudrup&apos;s team expect Swansea again to dominate the possession. The question then becomes whether Wilfried Bony can find a way to break Spurs&apos; resistance at the back, or whether Emmanuel Adebayor has one of those rare good days to get his manager out of jail.  \u2022 Tottenham prepared to sell Etienne Capoue\u2022 Adnan Januzaj proves difference against Swansea  9) Will Special One release the hounds? After Chelsea lost to Sunderland in the Carling Cup Jos\u00e9 Mourinho sounded an ominous warning that he was considering a shift in their tactics to help the defence: &quot;If I want to win 1-0, I think I can, as I think it&apos;s one of the easiest things in football. It&apos;s not so difficult, as you don&apos;t give players the chance to express themselves.&quot; There swiftly followed a dour 0-0 draw at Arsenal, and Chelsea have conceded just one goal \u2013 at home to Liverpool \u2013 since the League Cup exit. In truth it was a slightly disingenuous statement \u2013 Mourinho had already shown his true colours in just the third game of the season, when he took his side to Old Trafford to play out a 0-0 draw in which neither side seemed to have much interest in pushing for a win. However, those sort of tactics are easy to justify away from home against a strong side \u2013 but will Chelsea fans, and the owner, accept a similar performance at home to a Manchester United team looking distinctly wobbly? Moyes&apos;s team have played sides from the current top six seven times in the league so far this season, managing only five points and a solitary win from those game. Now shorn of their main attacking threats, with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie both injured, they&apos;re ripe for the taking. So will Mourinho unleash the hounds \u2013 or will United&apos;s lingering reputation of strength and his natural conservatism result in another disappointing &quot;Super Sunday&quot; clash at Stamford Bridge?  \u2022 Robin van Persie: Moyes will turn thing around soon\u2022 Wayne Rooney may be out for three more weeks  10) Is Mel a Wenger or more of a Ramos? When the TV companies picked West Bromwich Albion v Everton for the Monday night match one suspects it was more out of obligation \u2013 every team must feature a certain number of times \u2013 rather than any great expectations of the quality or excitement at the sporting contest. However, as luck would have it, it gives everybody the chance to witness first hand the club&apos;s new manager in his first match in charge. Not much is known about Pepe Mel, sacked at Rayo Vallecano after leading them to the second division, then sacked by Real Betis following a poor run at the end of 2013 it&apos;s an appointment that&apos;s come somewhat out of left field, and doesn&apos;t seem like a significant improvement upon Steve Clarke, who&apos;d enjoyed such a good start to his managerial career last season. The Baggies&apos; fans never seemed wholly convinced with the rationale for disposing of Clarke, and a strong start by Mel will be vital if he&apos;s to get them on side and lead the team up the table. Of course, a match against Everton is no easy start \u2013 Roberto Mart\u00ednez&apos;s side are maintaining their push for a Champions League place, and have upset far stronger sides than West Brom this season, so the crowd may be wise to reserve judgement until next week&apos;s encounter against Aston Villa, direct rivals both geographically and in league positions. Mel is not the first foreign manager to arrive without name recognition on these shores \u2013 &apos;Ars\u00e8ne Who?&apos; springs to mind, as does the similarly timed arrival of Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton last year. But then so too do the names Gross, Venglos and Perrin. So what is it to be for Mel, is he a Wenger or more of a Juande Ramos?  \u2022 Matej Vydra: Pepe Mel needs a great start\u2022 Everton sell Nikica Jelavic to Hull City\u2022 Sid Lowe on new Baggies boss Pep Mel "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/17/uk-planning-expert-peter-hall-britain-wrong", "sentences": ["When we meet to discuss his work, he mentions that he has returned from a flying visit to Singapore, where he was judging a competition."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-17T14:00:00Z", "title": "UK planning expert: there is something wrong with Britain", "tags": ["Architecture", "Books", "Culture", "Regeneration", "Communities", "Housing", "Society", "Planning policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "There are all sorts of stereotypes about academics: their learning is deep but absurdly narrow. They write only for their peers and do that badly. They like a quiet life. Their research is of little direct practical relevance. Granted, most academics don&apos;t conform to all of these stereotypes. But few defy them as completely as Peter Hall. As the most celebrated planning expert in\u00a0the land, Peter Hall is a\u00a0good advert for a\u00a0not-much-loved profession. During a career lasting 60\u00a0years, he has written highly influential books, some for specialists, others for the public, but all\u00a0highly readable. He has travelled the world tirelessly, studying cities and regions, and forging connections and alliances \u2013 he reckons he has travelled about 70,000 miles for each of the last 40 years, the equivalent of about seven trips to the moon. And his ideas have had a direct influence on politicians and policymakers across the\u00a0political spectrum. I recently emailed him to ask if he had any sense of the number of articles he has written. &quot;A quick count: chapters in books, 173; academic articles, 214; New Society (1962-87), 60 main articles plus about 1,500 shorter pieces; The Planner (1989-91), 29 pieces; Town and\u00a0Country Planning (1999-2012), 140\u00a0pieces. Total: around 2,100, and 50\u00a0books, not counting second/third editions/translations.&quot; And he doesn&apos;t show any sign of slowing down. Some of his students have just published a festschrift in his\u00a0honour, entitled The Planning Imagination. When we meet to discuss his work, he mentions that he has returned from a flying visit to Singapore, where he was judging a competition. He has recently finished another book: Good Cities, Better Lives, How Europe Discovered the Lost Art of Urbanism. And\u00a0he is working on a\u00a0major revision of Sociable Cities, a\u00a0book he co-authored in the 1990s with\u00a0the anarchist planner, Colin Ward, which explores the enduring significance of Hall&apos;s great hero, the early 20th-century radical planner Ebenezer Howard. Hall was born in London in 1932 and\u00a0one of his earliest memories is of his father \u2013 a &quot;not very elevated civil servant&quot; \u2013 lifting him up over a wall to\u00a0get a view of a Piccadilly line underground train emerging from a tunnel. It\u00a0was the beginning of a deep interest in trains and transport. At the age of six\u00a0he could draw an accurate map of\u00a0the London underground. During the war, however, Hall&apos;s family moved to Blackpool where he got an &quot;Eton-quality&quot; education at the local grammar school. It is no coincidence that his work is marked out by a great interest in London, but also a concern with the north-south divide. He was chair of Blackpool&apos;s regeneration agency from 2004 to 2008 and remains devoted to the town. His school and university years left him with a lifelong love of ideas and literature. The new Feschrift ends with an autobiographical chapter by Hall himself, the Latin title of which, &quot;Apologia Pro Vita Sua&quot;, pays homage to Cardinal Newman \u2013 an author not much read in planning circles.     Hall's Great Planning Disasters sought to draw lessons from projects that had been badly managed such as the Sydney Opera House. Photograph: Hemis/Alamy    Hall began firmly on the left. The first of his books to attract widespread attention, London 2001, published in 1963, is in some ways a period piece. It\u00a0argues for a major replanning of London and the south-east, complete with urban motorways and &quot;clean sweep&quot; demolition programmes. But by the end of the 1960s he had begun to see\u00a0the limits of top-down planning. He says now it is easy to forget how &quot;dreadful Britain was in the 1970s \u2026 In\u00a01979, I had been offered a job at Berkeley, California. I was attending a\u00a0conference in Manchester. There was a tanker drivers&apos; strike and I\u00a0was sitting in a half-mile motionless queue at a\u00a0petrol station on the Oxford Road. I\u00a0remember thinking, what do\u00a0I\u00a0do if I\u00a0can&apos;t get back to London? Do I abandon the car or try to sell it? It\u00a0was then I decided to take up the offer from\u00a0Berkeley.&quot; In 1980, he published a classic text, Great Planning Disasters, an attempt, as he put it, to answer the question: &quot;How is it we can&apos;t get to the airport, when we can get to the moon?&quot; The book sought to draw lessons from a\u00a0series of well-known government-backed projects that had never been built, or had run badly over budget or time. They included the third London airport, Concorde, the Sydney Opera House and San Francisco&apos;s bay area rapid transport system. As former industrial cities began to rot in the 1970s, he produced a series of\u00a0papers arguing that one response to\u00a0the challenge of urban regeneration might be to experiment with an anarchist approach and simply remove planning restrictions in a limited number of areas. &quot;In other words, we would aim to recreate the Hong Kong of the 1950s and 1960s inside inner Liverpool or inner Glasgow.&quot; These ideas turned out to be a major influence on the new Thatcher government, and helped prepare the ground for the &quot;enterprise zone&quot; policy of the early 1980s, which itself led, among other things, to the creation of Canary Wharf. Most academics would be dismayed to see their ideas spin beyond their control in this way, but Hall appears to savour the irony. Asked which of all the political leaders he has worked with have impressed him most, he answers without hesitation: &quot;Oh certainly Michael Heseltine and Andrew Adonis.&quot; He and Heseltine worked closely together, during Heseltine&apos;s time in the Thatcher and Major government. Hall and Adonis got to know each other when Adonis was minister of transport in the last Labour government, and they continue to plot together on roads, railways and trams. Hall&apos;s work developed in other ways, too, that could not be foreseen back in 1963. When he started teaching at Berkeley, he was one of the first to apprehend the enormous transformation that computing and information technology would bring about \u2013 he has been a close observer of Silicon Valley He became increasingly interested in cities as crucibles of innovation. It is commonplace now to say that invention and economic development are characteristically urban phenomena \u2013 they depend on unplanned connections and extensive collaborations that only large cities can facilitate \u2013 but his great book Cities in Civilisation, which starts in Athens and ends in Canary Wharf, was pretty much first on the scene. Stretching over 1,100\u00a0pages, its\u00a0scope extends beyond technical and\u00a0economic innovations to\u00a0take in religion, art, literature and\u00a0philosophy.     'A model of sustainable urban life' \u2026 Freiburg in Germany. Photograph: Olivier Kern/Eastway    But there are strong continuities in his intellectual life, as well as turning points. He has long been interested not\u00a0just in cities but in regions. Indeed, he helped invent the concept of the &quot;city\u00a0region&quot;, with which all planning students are now familiar. Just as his 1988 book Cities of Tomorrow is probably the most widely read history of modern planning, so his 1974 Urban and Regional Planning was for 30 years the most widely used text book in the field. For all his culture and globe-trotting, he is at home in Milton Keynes and Reading, where\u00a0he\u00a0taught throughout the 1970s,\u00a0and\u00a0is\u00a0as happy talking about the need\u00a0to upgrade the A13 as he is about\u00a0quattrocento Florence. Hall is a big fan of high-speed rail and a long-term term advocate of HS2 \u2013 though he has been impressed by some of the objections to it and has recently changed his position somewhat. He is also one of the leading champions of Boris Johnson&apos;s plans to replace Heathrow with a massive airport in the\u00a0Thames estuary. How is it that the author of Great Planning Disasters could continue to champion such risky\u00a0infrastructure projects? &quot;People forget that I discussed two types of disaster in my book: disastrous developments and disastrous failures to develop.&quot; Finally, there is his lifelong commitment to Ebenezer Howard and\u00a0the garden-city movement. In his celebrated book Garden Cities of Tomorrow (1902), Howard put forward a vision of\u00a0a new sort of development to replace the cramped, fetid cities of the 19th century. Garden cities would be pleasant, healthy, equitable and industrious. Hall continues to argue that, while large cities have their place, smaller cities on the garden-city model have enormous potential. &quot;I remain very firmly wedded,&quot; he says, &quot;to a huge new programme of garden cities.&quot; The essential argument of the new book, Good Cities, Better Lives, is simple: there is something wrong with\u00a0the way we develop our built environment in Britain. We don&apos;t build enough, and what we build is too often\u00a0ugly, alienating and poorly served by infrastructure. For some time, Hall and\u00a0his colleagues at the Town and Country Planning Association have been organising field trips to\u00a0cities in France, the Netherlands, Germany and\u00a0Scandinavia that appear to have it\u00a0all figured out \u2013 he cites Freiburg as the\u00a0outstanding example. &quot;They have created good jobs, built superb housing\u00a0in fine natural settings and generated rich urban lives. But not\u00a0only that: simultaneously these cities have become models of sustainable urban life, minimising energy needs, recycling waste and reducing emissions.&quot; Hall has a clear idea of what the planning discipline should be about: it\u00a0should be grounded in an understanding of the real world; it should be\u00a0informed by a deep knowledge of\u00a0history and a sense of cultural possibility; and, above all, it should remain focused on improving lives. He\u00a0is himself the consummate planner."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/18/chang-rae-lee-interview", "sentences": ["When he was creating the Charter villages in the novel, he had in mind Singapore, where everything is shiny and bright, and fanatically orderly."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-18T08:45:00Z", "title": "Chang-rae Lee: 'When people asked, I'd say, \"I'm writing a very strange book.\" I thought no one was going to get it'", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Chang-rae Lee was on\u00a0a\u00a0research trip to China, looking around a factory he\u00a0imagined he might write about.

There&apos;s all this great journalism about China these days.&quot; Instead, what germinated was an idea of the future: a\u00a0dystopian novel set in America, where the descendants of immigrant Chinese workers occupy the safe, closed and relentlessly monotonous society of the kept worker class, exchanging liberty for security in\u00a0a system permitting no upward advancement. The town they live in is called B-Mor, an iteration of Baltimore, after its native inhabitants have cleared out, and they work as intensive fish farmers until they die, young, of new diseases. &quot;Our tainted world looms within us, every one,&quot; Lee writes, and admits that he was, at times, baffled by the direction of his own work. &quot;When people asked, I&apos;d\u00a0say, I&apos;m writing a very strange book. I thought, no one is going to get this book.&quot; Much of this has to do with the unconventional heroine. On Such a Full Sea (the title comes from Julius Caesar: &quot;On such a full sea are we now afloat; / And we must take the current when it\u00a0serves, / Or lose our ventures&quot;) is driven by the adventures of Fan, aged 16, who leaves B-Mor to take her chances in the unpoliced &quot;counties&quot; outside the industrial sector. There is nothing cute about Fan; she doesn&apos;t say funny things or run an interior monologue. She doesn&apos;t say much at all; rather, she moves around the story as unselfconsciously as water. &quot;I meant her to be the focus of our attention, the central character,&quot; says Lee, &quot;but not necessarily the central consciousness. She&apos;s not that sort of hero: she&apos;s not loquacious, she&apos;s not philosophical; she is more elemental. She&apos;s there, she persists. And that&apos;s the sort of person I wanted her to be.&quot; Lee smiles. He is not overly loquacious himself. Fan is, perversely, more attractive a heroine precisely because of these things, and to maintain\u00a0a space around her, Lee tells the story not from her point of view but from the perspective of the people she left behind. It is a first-person plural that contributes to the sense of\u00a0her journey as mythic and was necessary, says Lee, to establish &quot;the\u00a0ways in which these folks in the dystopia need to create stories for themselves. It&apos;s the only way they can\u00a0break out of their circumstance.&quot; The tone of the narration is muted, like a held breath \u2013 Fan, before her departure, was a diver in the fish tanks, capable of extraordinary feats of free diving, which, writes Lee, left her exhausted &quot;not by the work or holding her breath but instead from the strange exertion of pushing against the emptiness.&quot; The ellipsis of those moments in the tank seems to hang over the novel as a whole; it has the quality of something held finely but perilously in balance. It also, like the best novels, leaves a great deal unsaid. When Fan leaves B-Mor, it is ostensibly to find her missing boyfriend, but she is also propelled by a less distinct yearning, for something the factory town makes no allowance for: the sublime. On Such a Full Sea is, at heart, a\u00a0romantic novel, but with so few adornments that Lee had to hold his nerve writing it, particularly when it came to Fan. &quot;All the things that we have now are about\u00a0revealing private moments of consciousness, and sharing them with each other. A\u00a0constantly defining and redefining of\u00a0each other and ourselves by all this stuff. And it&apos;s exhausting. And the thought experiment for me artistically was: could I write a story in which the main character had none of that stuff? But you&apos;d still feel something for her, and care about her, if you didn&apos;t really know her. And what was that? That seems to me elementally what a\u00a0hero is. It&apos;s not because we know them so well. They&apos;re magnetic. It&apos;s a\u00a0different kind of charisma.&quot; The fascinating thing about On Such a Full Sea is that, for all its adventure narrative, it is underpinned by a solid and shrewd reading of present-day American economics. It is a novel of its\u00a0time, caught up in recessionary politics and what happens when social mobility, except for a lucky few, effectively grinds to a halt. Lee grew up in Westchester, a posh suburb of New York that, in the book, is\u00a0represented by the &quot;Charter villages&quot;, the highly secure zones where rich people live and work, unless they lose their place in the pecking order and are\u00a0chucked out into the wilderness. Lee&apos;s parents, a psychiatrist and a home-maker, were immigrants from Korea, which gave him, he says, some perspective on the privilege of his upbringing. &quot;Even though I went to Exeter and Yale, and I enjoyed all the trappings of\u00a0those places, I think at the same time \u2013 and maybe it&apos;s because I&apos;m an immigrant kid and not white \u2013 there was always this other consciousness; that is, I was conscious of everything that was going on. And I was observing. Some people just ARE, because the temperature of the water is exactly the temperature of their body.&quot; He laughs. &quot;But my temperature is always off, a\u00a0little bit. And I have to note it. And I\u00a0always did, from a very young age. I\u00a0don&apos;t know if that&apos;s my character or upbringing or both.&quot; Like the residents of B-Mor, who find themselves making small, meaningless gestures of revolt, as a child Lee could never quite stop himself from upending things. &quot;I felt something creative. I\u00a0remember when I was in art classes I\u00a0hated following the assignments. And I would get in trouble for doing something totally different, or taking it in a weird direction. I didn&apos;t think it through or anything, it was just this impulse. I felt like I was never going to quite fit in terms of following rules. And I&apos;d been taught my whole life to follow rules. And to a great extent did. But the last 5% I always wanted to ruin everything.&quot; Lee felt under pressure from his parents to get a conventional job after college, and so, against his better judgment, went into finance. Exactly a\u00a0year to the day after he joined a Wall\u00a0Street firm as an analyst, he quit. &quot;My\u00a0parents \u2013 my mother particularly \u2013 were very focused on our succeeding. I\u00a0loved my parents, and was very grateful to them for everything, and I\u00a0didn&apos;t want to disappoint them. But I\u00a0knew it wasn&apos;t going to be my passion. I quite enjoyed making some money. But I could tell that others had a passion for it that I would only be straining to manufacture \u2026 So I got out when I was 22. I thought, if I fail at writing, I can go back at 27.&quot; He had some money saved, and his parents helped in the last few years of that five-year test period. Lee also went to graduate school, and by the end of the five years was getting somewhere with his first novel, Native Speaker, which won the PEN/Hemingway award. By his fourth, The Surrendered, which draws on his father&apos;s war-time experience in Korea, he was a Pulitzer finalist. In On Such a Full Sea, his fifth novel, Lee draws on some of what struck him during that brief period in Wall Street, particularly pertinent now in light of debates about the 1%. The question, he\u00a0asks, is what does that kind of stratified privilege do\u00a0to a person&apos;s interior life, when the alternatives are so utterly miserable? When he was creating the Charter villages in the novel, he had in mind Singapore, where everything is shiny and bright, and fanatically orderly. To\u00a0me, it sounded more like contemporary Manhattan in the age of the hedge-fund manager. &quot;So much of this book is the narrator talking about freedom, but it&apos;s not political freedom. It&apos;s freedom of imagination. Freedom of the soul, somehow. And all these people are trapped; the counties people are trapped in chaos and neglect. The B-Mors are trapped in\u00a0their regulations and need to get along. But the Charters, in my view, are\u00a0trapped most. They&apos;re imprisoned by all the things that they feel are safeguarding them. From death. And completely wasting their time.&quot; He has a keen satirical eye for modern fads. Of the inhabitants of Seneca, one of the Charter villages, he writes: &quot;They looked fit enough and not one of\u00a0them could be termed fat, but it seemed to Fan they were maintaining themselves in a stressful way, such as not quite eating enough, their dogged faces a bit too drawn, even slightly desiccated.&quot; The most savage event in the story does not take place in the unpoliced zones, but rather within Seneca, where people have the most to lose. Lee says, &quot;The Charters are not stupid. They&apos;re educated. They&apos;re all like us. Good health care. Means. But because of their entrenchment and cloistering, they&apos;ve ceased to think that there&apos;s any reason or possibility of looking outwards. It&apos;s not even lack of empathy. It&apos;s almost...lack of vision. The possibility of even seeing.&quot; The question is what does it do to introspection? &quot;Yes. The question is what&apos;s left, after that? Fetish. Obsession. Some sort of pathological interest in staying alive. And a certain kind of degeneracy that&apos;s not creative. I&apos;m all for degeneracy if it&apos;s creative. But it&apos;s a living death.&quot; It comes down, as in all things, to perspective. Lee&apos;s defection from finance was something his parents might have worried about more, if it hadn&apos;t been for the timing. &quot;My mother was dying at the same time, so I think that was obviously a bigger issue than my career. In a way, it also put things in perspective for all of us. I think my parents recognised that I&apos;d always wanted to be a writer, and so they didn&apos;t think that this was some idle, faddish wish on my part.&quot; After his mother&apos;s death, he wrote a\u00a0very touching piece for the New Yorker recounting her last days and the\u00a0weeks and months afterwards, when he cooked her favourite Korean recipes but they always came out wrong. While\u00a0she was dying, she had raised a\u00a0worry that shocked him at the time. She wondered if sending him to boarding school had been the wrong thing to do, taking those years away from them both. &quot;So\u00a0why did you?&quot; he\u00a0asks. She says, &quot;Because I\u00a0didn&apos;t know I was going to die.&quot; There is a lot of brutality and deadened feeling in On Such a Full Sea, but it\u00a0ends, finally, on notes of love. Lee\u00a0is tender on this subject. &quot;If she possessed a genius,&quot; he writes of Fan, &quot;it was a\u00a0capacity for understanding and trusting the improvisational nature of her will.&quot; The role of the individual only has\u00a0meaning in relation to the whole, a\u00a0point Lee makes via the comical image of Fan&apos;s outsized boyfriend standing alongside her diminutive figure. They should look ridiculous together, Lee writes, but, &quot;he sized her, if this can be said, the way a planet does its moon, the two bodies perhaps much differing within their scale but nothing like they would be once adrift in the profound vastness of space.&quot; Throughout her adventures and near-death experiences, the point at which Fan feels most adrift is an ordinary moment of disconnect: &quot;the feeling can come from something as unpitched as this: standing among a\u00a0roomful of strangers in a house far\u00a0away&quot;. It was Lee&apos;s own daughters who partly inspired him to write the book; he has a 13- and a 16-year-old, and he wanted to write something they might potentially enjoy, or create a heroine they might identify with. The book has, half tongue in cheek, been compared to\u00a0The Hunger Games, which makes him laugh. &quot;It&apos;s because there&apos;s a young girl and she leaves. It&apos;s fine! Those people will be disappointed.&quot; Then he quickly adds, before his publishers can shout at him: &quot;But I&apos;m hoping even those readers might magically think, &apos;Hang on, I like Fan, and I don&apos;t quite know why.&apos; And that&apos;s OK. That&apos;d be great.&quot; Perhaps, too, he would like to show his daughters that it&apos;s not a bad idea, occasionally, to quit passively consuming and get up and do something. &quot;Fan\u00a0seems to be the only one who is discovering by doing. And that&apos;s what everyone in the book, all the people who meet her, whether they want to use her or not, they all see that little thing in her, that is inspiring. They see that she&apos;s free. She&apos;s free of all those other attachments and deformations that have happened to them because of their circumstance. And that somehow she&apos;s able to, just by the act of moving around, transcend those things. And it&apos;s moving that has kept her still.&quot; Without quite planning to, Lee has provided an antidote to the background yapping we all suffer these days. &quot;Almost all of\u00a0western literature is about talk,&quot; he says. &quot;There&apos;s this great line in Beckett: keep talking, you&apos;re winning. And somehow I wanted to subvert that; the\u00a0need to constantly express and put your verbal and psychological stamp on everything.&quot; He smiles. &quot;You\u00a0don&apos;t always have to talk.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/18/mike-leigh-mr-kipling", "sentences": ["&quot;Or an Irish whiskey?&quot; The sweetest story he told me was of how, during solo travels following his father&apos;s death, in midlife crisis mode and with hernia, he&apos;d &quot;sat on a toilet, in a cheap hotel in Singapore, reading a local English-language newspaper&quot;.", "They retitled the play Be My Sushi Tonight and performed in Chinese-Singapore patois."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-18T18:00:00Z", "title": "Mike Leigh: actors and Mr Kipling cakes", "tags": ["Mike Leigh", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Film"], "article": "In 1988 director Mike Leigh welcomed me into his Wood Green home with an &quot;I&apos;ll put the kettle on&quot;.

Gisborne acknowledged: &quot;The superiority of the female mind is unrivalled.&quot; Unrivalled, that is, in duties that &quot;\u2026 refresh the over-laboured faculties of the wise \u2013 and, diffuse, throughout the family circle, the enlivening and endearing smile of cheerfulness.&quot; In her 2010 book, Delusions of Gender, psychologist Cordelia Fine points out we conform to whatever are the prevailing social expectations of what it means to &quot;man up&quot; or act as a &quot;real woman&quot;. In the 18th century, that meant many girls abided by notions of excessive femininity. But now? As the last several days have amply demonstrated, when male and female roles are under constant redefinition, dictated not least by the market and the need to earn a family wage, while a certain class of men, accustomed to generations in power, see both their influence and &quot;their&quot; institutions challenged, it can become a bruising and, at times, ugly, contradictory and profoundly socially unjust battle. But first, we have the good news. On Friday, the London Stock Exchange appointed two women directors, Sherry Coutu and Joanna Shields. The proportion of women on FTSE 100 boards has topped 20% for the first time, raising hopes that the UK government&apos;s weedy target of 25% of female representation by 2015 is reached without mandatory quotas. According to Jane Scott, the UK director of Professional Boards Forum, only 13 FTSE 100 companies have 30% or more female representation on the board. &quot;There is no shortage of candidates,&quot; Scott says. &quot;And there is no compromise on the experience or skills required.&quot; The economic argument has been repeatedly proved. In a 2012 report, for example, the Credit Suisse Research Institute said that organisations with one woman or more on the board outperformed those with none by 26% over a six-year period. In that context, shareholders should be appalled at the poor commercial judgment on display, if not the sexism. Change in the boardroom is under way but it is hardly a female revolution. Greater participation in public and political life is vital to such an endeavour. However, only one in four MPs is female; women are a tiny minority at the cabinet table and in the Lords, in senior financial committees, at the higher echelons of the judiciary and on public boards. Innovatory schemes such as the Fabian Women&apos;s network programme are essential to challenge the old boys&apos; alliances whose roots are centuries old. However, until a critical mass is achieved, women in parliament and public office will continue to feel guests in a predominantly hostile house. A battle that resumes tomorrow at Westminster  yet again reveals the size of the gulf between the Lords and the ladies. Or, more precisely, in this case, the 10 women who have alleged that the Liberal Democrat Lord Rennard behaved &quot;inappropriately&quot;. The women have been judged &quot;credible&quot; witnesses yet, surreally, the rules of the Liberal Democrat party do not permit disciplinary action. Rennard has refused Clegg&apos;s request to apologise. Undoubtedly, the electorate will take heed that in 2014 a major political party has no suitable procedure for dealing with serious sexual allegations. In contrast, the law courts are, belatedly, proving more active. Tomorrow, supported by more than 100 peers, Lord Rennard intends to resume his seat. As we report today, Bridget Harris, one of his accusers, has quit the party in disgust. &quot;Nick Clegg had a duty to show moral leadership. He hasn&apos;t&quot;, she says. &quot;I don&apos;t believe that parliament is the place for change anymore.&quot; It is precisely this lack of representation that means women, unjustly, have become the shock absorbers of austerity. They are paying a far higher price proportionately than men, finding themselves cemented into a lifetime of low earnings and under-utilised qualifications. George Osborne, has announced a further \u00a312bn in public spending cuts. As feminist economists on the Women&apos;s Budget Group repeatedly point out, 65% of jobs in the public sector are held by women; 310,000 public sector jobs will be axed in five years until 2015. Eighty per cent of the &quot;new&quot; jobs are in the private sector, according to the TUC. They are low skill, low paid. A far higher proportion of female income therefore also comes from benefits so, again, women are hit hardest by benefit cuts. Paradoxically, at school, girls outperform boys. However, they are scarce, for instance, in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). In 2012, 12 times more boys than girls took computer studies at A-level. In Shanghai and Singapore, there is no gender division in the subject. Here, segregation by occupation continues. Women are steered into the arts and &quot;care&quot;, grossly undervalued. Even when they enter the professions, progress halts when they have children. Part-time means a career is sabotaged. Childcare costs cripple. According to the Fawcett Society, twice as many women as men are economically inactive; three times more women are in part-time work; and 28% of women are low paid compared with 17% of men. Skills-appropriate jobs for women could boost GDP by 10% by 2030. Everyone benefits. Instead, currently for women, the ladders are rapidly disappearing as the snakes on the board multiply. A general election may help. In 2015, politicians will temporarily scramble to find their inner woman as they go in search of the crucial female vote. Manifestos should signal that investment in social infrastructure matters. Universal free childcare ought to carry as much clout as rail expansion and HS2. Women need flexible working that strongly supports part-time careers. Reskilling is a priority; child benefit should be restored and anomalies in tax credits addressed. More than 900,000 working families will not qualify because one or both parents earn too little to pay income tax. Among other demands should be added equal pay and positive action in public life, quotas even. What this agenda costs in the short term will be more than matched by what is unleashed in talent and capabilities, improved tax revenues and reduced benefits. Ideally, a flourishing society allows everyone, male and female, to fulfil their potential. Instead, gender, class and ethnicity all carry heavy and unnecessary penalties. That is socially unjust, economically unsound, globally uncompetitive and politically naive. Not even the men in charge can affordthis to continue."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/19/cardiff-dubai-icc-administrative-base-singapore-colombo", "sentences": ["Cardiff is one of three contenders, with Colombo and Singapore, to replace Dubai as the administrative base of the International Cricket Council.", "The F&amp;CA is currently in the final stages of evaluating these options, including reviewing the comparative advantages and disadvantages of Singapore, Colombo, Cardiff and Dubai as the administrative home of the ICC, and will report back to the ICC executive board on this matter shortly.&quot; The ICC has been linked with a move from Dubai on a couple of previous occasions, with the former England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (and Glamorgan) president David Morgan heading a six-man panel that considered a return to Lord&apos;s in 2009, when Mumbai was also mooted.", "Singapore missed out to Dubai when the decision was made to leave Lord&apos;s in 2005 and, like Colombo, would recognise the new power-base of the global game in Asia."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-19T18:27:00Z", "title": "Cardiff in contention to replace Dubai as ICC's administrative base", "tags": ["International Cricket Council", "England cricket team", "India cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Australia sport", "Cricket", "Sport", "Sport politics"], "article": "Cardiff is one of three contenders, with Colombo and Singapore, to replace Dubai as the administrative base of the International Cricket Council. That is one of the more unlikely and intriguing proposals in the leaked working paper of the ICC&apos;s financial and commercial affairs committee, to be discussed at a board meeting on Wednesday week, which has inevitably been overlooked in the global furore provoked by the desire of England, Australia and India to seize greater control of the game. There is no chance of the ICC leaving the jurisdiction of the United Arab Emirates, where it has been based since leaving Lord&apos;s in 2005. But in its working paper, which has been seen by the Guardian, the F&amp;CA stresses: &quot;Under UAE laws it is not necessary for the management to be located in the same jurisdiction. &quot;This facilitates the possible relocation of ICC management from Dubai to any potentially more favourable location where local talent is also available. The F&amp;CA is currently in the final stages of evaluating these options, including reviewing the comparative advantages and disadvantages of Singapore, Colombo, Cardiff and Dubai as the administrative home of the ICC, and will report back to the ICC executive board on this matter shortly.&quot; The ICC has been linked with a move from Dubai on a couple of previous occasions, with the former England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (and Glamorgan) president David Morgan heading a six-man panel that considered a return to Lord&apos;s in 2009, when Mumbai was also mooted. Singapore missed out to Dubai when the decision was made to leave Lord&apos;s in 2005 and, like Colombo, would recognise the new power-base of the global game in Asia. However, Cardiff has emerged as a more cost-effective British option than Lord&apos;s. It was one of three host cities for the ICC&apos;s Champions Trophy last summer, largely due to financial support from the Welsh government, which would almost certainly be forthcoming in an effort to secure a permanent ICC presence in Cardiff. Reaction to the more contentious aspects of the F&amp;CA&apos;s proposals \u2013 notably the creation of a new four-man executive committee on which England, India and Australia would be permanent members, and the exemption of the same three countries from relegation under a new two-tier system for Test cricket \u2013 has been mostly hostile. Giles Clarke, the ECB&apos;s chairman who also chairs the F&amp;CA, and his major allies \u2013 Wally Edwards of Cricket Australia and N Srinivasan of the Board of Control for Cricket in India \u2013 will not have been remotely surprised by that. But the key for them will be how the numbers stack up when their paper is considered at the quarterly meeting of the ICC board on 28-29 January. If the alternative, as has been suggested, is India walking away from the ICC, then the other seven full members may regard proposals that bind India to a four-man executive committee and maintain some, admittedly reduced, financial guarantees \u2013 including the establishment of a new Test Match Fund to support loss-making five-day cricket \u2013 more sympathetically than most in the media. Martin Snedden, a member of the New Zealand Cricket Board, provided a first hint of the lesser nations&apos; priorities when he conceded that a desire for India to secure a greater share of the revenue for which they are largely responsible is &quot;not unreasonable&quot; but stressed the importance of at least maintaining the current future tours programme, which runs until 2020. &quot;Do we have power at the ICC table?&quot; Snedden asked in Wellington&apos;s Dominion Post, rhetorically. &quot;Not a hell of a lot. Do we have an ability to influence and persuade? A little bit. &quot;The critical thing that [we] have to do is identify those things that are most critical to us and try and ensure we secure the stability of a playing programme and the stability of revenue that we need.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2014/jan/20/south-korea-housing-problem-jeonse-rent", "sentences": ["Unlike booming Hong Kong or Singapore, home prices fell about 8% last year."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-20T11:31:41Z", "title": "How do you solve a problem like Korea's dysfunctional housing market?", "tags": ["Housing Network", "Housing management", "South Korea", "Housing network blog", "Housing", "Communities", "Society", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Society Professionals"], "article": "Imagine a world where a \u00a3100,000 deposit for a small flat is cheap; where having 60% of the value of your next home means you haven&apos;t saved enough and you&apos;re running short of time because your tenancy (yes, that the huge deposit was only key money) will be over in two years. Welcome to jeonse and the Korean housing market. And it is a strange market to British eyes. Homeownership is not popular. Unlike booming Hong Kong or Singapore, home prices fell about 8% last year. Rather than buy a depreciating asset, the middle classes look to rent. The only problem is that the sums no longer add up for the majority of landlords either. Jeonse (pronounced cheon-say) is a unique derivative of an old Korean tenure. It made sense in a rapidly urbanising country in the late 20th century. Once tenants raised the deposit, they would live rent free, usually for two years. The landlords got a healthy rate of return from the deposit, which they often invested in a booming economy, with the bonus that the growing population and urban redevelopment would push up the property&apos;s value as well. Unfortunately, a long-term decline in interest rates and insipid house price growth now means the only way to make jeonse worthwhile is for the deposits to rise. And they have rocketed. The average jeonse deposit has increased for a record 64 straight weeks and now stands 35% above 2008 levels. Borrowing for jeonse deposits has doubled since 2009. This is now particularly hurting the Republic&apos;s middle classes, who took on three-quarters of the \u00a334bn lent in the first half of 2013. Ministers in Seoul are keenly aware of the twin political threats housing poses for president Park Geun-hye&apos;s one-year-old administration. Not only are disposable incomes being squeezed by costly borrowing, but the switch from personal consumption is also undermining economic growth. So, in moves reminiscent of Britain&apos;s recent housing ministers, the government has pulled every policy lever it can grasp: relaxing personal borrowing restrictions, developing public brownfield land, halving housing purchase tax and introducing both a Help-to-Buy-style mortgage and a &quot;profit-sharing&quot; mortgage. But, three other policies stand out as a reminder of what governments can do. The Park administration intends to double the number of state-owned homes it builds for rent, introduce a national regeneration commitment (comprising grants and legislation) and finally, a detailed plan to reform the financing of affordable housing.

The prize sees a panel of judges select the six best entries from more than 1,400 stories submitted this year. The authors&apos; identities are kept secret from judges, but, remarkably, for the second year in a row they wound up choosing stories by the writers Angela Readman and Sheila Llewellyn. Readman&apos;s entry this year was the short story The Keeper of the Jackalopes, about &quot;a girl, her father, a Jackalope and survival&quot;, while Llewellyn was selected for her entry The Papakh Hat, set during the Iranian revolution, and following the lives of two men who &quot;are forced to make life-changing decisions about their future together&quot;. Both writers were also shortlisted for the 2012 short story award, which was also judged anonymously and which had more than 1,800 entries. &quot;I was amazed to\u00a0be shortlisted last year and even more amazed this year. It&apos;s a real boost to my confidence.\u00a0There are some fantastic stories again, this year, so I&apos;ll go along to the award ceremony, but not hold my breath. I guess\u00a0I can celebrate the achievement of being shortlisted twice\u00a0\u2013 anything else will be a bonus,&quot; said Llewellyn, who worked for the British Council in Iran, Africa and Singapore, and then retrained as a psychologist specialising in post-traumatic stress disorder before turning to writing. Readman, who is currently working on a short-story collection and who has won awards for her poetry, was also stunned. &quot;I was shocked to get shortlisted again. What are the odds? I don&apos;t know, I can&apos;t do that sort of maths,&quot; she said. &quot;It&apos;s not something anyone expects, particularly from a writer who hasn&apos;t had a story collection or anything out yet. I love that it could happen though \u2013 that it&apos;s so anonymous these things can happen. It&apos;s a confidence boost for anyone to get on the shortlist I think, but for unknown writers it&apos;s amazing. It&apos;s a much-needed feeling of validation\u00a0\u2026 you&apos;re suddenly not writing in the dark.&quot; This year, Readman and Llewellyn are up against stories from Tony Bagley, Clare Chandler, Erin Soros and Kit de Waal. The public has been voting on the six entries, with voting now closed, and the authors&apos; names kept secret until today. The winner will be announced at the Costa book awards on 28 January, and will receive \u00a33,500. Bagley&apos;s The Forgiveness Thing sees a journalist suspect the motives of a disfigured man who forgives his attacker. Chandler&apos;s The Gun Shearer is set during a New South Wales heatwave, when a young sheep shearer arrives at a farm, and Soros&apos;s Still Water, BC, set on a logging camp, telling the story of the only woman present as she nears the end of her pregnancy. De Waal&apos;s The Old Man and the Suit takes place in the basement workshop of an old tailor, as he and his apprentice &quot;struggle with life, love and mastering the perfect suit&quot;. &quot;The general level of entries this year was pleasingly high, and presented us with a wide variety of themes, voices and settings,&quot; said judge Fanny Blake, a novelist and journalist. &quot;These stories represent the best of those. We chose six strong voices that draw the reader into six very different worlds with writing that is concise, effective and touches the heart.&quot; The winner of the short story prize does not go forward with the other Costa category winners \u2013 first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children&apos;s book \u2013 to compete for the overall book of the year award.

First among our priorities are adolescent girls; women; and children in their first 1,000 days of life, when poor nutrition causes lifelong problems. We support innovative, multi-stakeholder partnerships that deliver nutrition to as many people as possible. By helping to introduce new and improved models of delivery to meet local needs, our partnerships leverage the resources of governments, civil society, business and humanitarian agencies interested in reversing malnutrition. Motivated by the key themes of Innovation, Scale and Impact, GAIN is organised across six global initiatives: large-scale food fortification; multinutrient supplements; nutritious foods for children and mothers; agriculture and nutrition; nutrition in the workplace, supply chains and communities; and our newest initiative, nutrition in emergencies. GAIN-supported programmes in 2013 reached an estimated 811 million people across almost 40 countries, at a cost of only US$ 0.27 per target individual. Our near-term goal is to provide a sustainable source of affordable, nutritious food for 1 billion people by 2015. In our programmes, we aim to reduce micronutrient deficiencies and stunting by up to 30% and 10% respectively. As a Swiss-based not-for-profit with international organisation status, GAIN&apos;s worldwide presence includes country offices in Abuja, Accra, Addis Ababa, Dhaka, Kabul, Jakarta, Maputo, Nairobi and New Delhi. Our head office is in Geneva; we also have representative offices in Amsterdam, London, Singapore and Washington, DC.

I\u00a0participated because it was clear the world&apos;s wealthiest leaders finally understood that to deal with this complex problem, an international response was needed. Cameron said: &quot;We need to make sure that mineral wealth in developing countries becomes a blessing, not a curse. So at the G8 I will push for greater transparency alongside more open trade.&quot; Few countries have experienced that\u00a0curse more than Guinea. For generations, internal corruption and a lack of governance and democracy allowed a few predator companies to steal the assets of our people with impunity. The Sudanese philanthropist, Mo Ibrahim, recently said of one of the contracts the government are now investigating: &quot;Are the Guineans who did that deal idiots or criminals? Or both?&quot; A good question. And one we hope to answer with the imminent publication of a review into the contracts signed in those dark days of dictatorship. I became Guinea&apos;s first democratically elected president four years ago, with huge public expectations. Among them, bring back the rule of law, return Guinea to solvency, and reduce the levels of fraud in our previously bloated military. It has been a hard and often bitter journey for Guineans but we are slowly starting to turn the tide. We have reduced our fiscal deficit to 3%, the army now accounts for 10% of our GDP rather than 40%, and economic growth this year is projected to exceed 4.5%. Yet there is a terrible irony in our struggle to bring our economy back from the brink. It is that Guinea is incredibly rich in natural resources \u2013 with the largest bauxite deposits and the single largest untapped iron ore assets in the world \u2013 none of which, until now, the people of Guinea have enjoyed. A small number of offshore companies, aided and abetted by corrupt domestic regimes, bled Guinea&apos;s resources for decades. A slow death facilitated by the network of lawyers, accountants and financial advisers sitting in offices in New York, London, Paris, Geneva, Hong Kong and Singapore. No more. I am in Davos to call on western governments to put power behind their promises of transparency and protect the interests, not only of Guinea, but also the responsible partners who are investing in our country and playing by the rules. I am asking nothing that Guinea is not doing itself, under far harder circumstances than those of the west. Our central bank reforms mean that our economy must rely on cash budgeting. We cannot print money, we must live on\u00a0what we have. The continuing overhaul of our mining industry has brought much-needed transparency to the allocation of contracts. We have involved the international NGO, Revenue Watch, to monitor state accounting practices. But we live in a global economy. We simply can&apos;t deal with the network of corruption embedded in a few key western institutions from a distance of nearly 3,000 miles. These corrupt practitioners operate from the west, but their practices are global and require a global response. Only tighter, more responsive and highly co-ordinated action between law enforcement authorities in both developing nations and the world&apos;s financial centres will be effective. Many companies and some governments already understand this. Some of the world&apos;s most respected companies are investing in our mining industry on fair and transparent terms. Co-operation from the US has already uncovered sizeable evidence of previous corruption. With international legal co-operation, Guinea will soon be announcing the outcome of an investigation into some of\u00a0the most disturbing allegations of mining corruption in Africa&apos;s history. I\u00a0ask other countries to do the same with their own financial institutions. Our country&apos;s past has not been one of which many Guineans can be proud. Our future must be. We are doing everything we can to create a state built on transparency and the rule of law. We do not expect western countries to solve our problems for us. But, starting with those few corrupt institutions they host, I do ask them to be part of a joint solution."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/banker-singapore-insults", "sentences": ["A British banker has been forced to apologise to the people of Singapore after he complained he would have to &quot;wash the stench of public transport&quot; off himself during a period of separation from normal mode of transport \u2013 his Porsche.", "Anton Casey, who lives as an expat in the city-state with his wife \u2013 a former Miss Singapore \u2013 also mocked the &quot;poor people&quot; he shared public transport with and made derogatory comments about a taxi driving in a series of posts online.", "In one post, he published a picture of his young son using Singaporean public transport, along with the caption: &quot;Daddy, where is your car and who are all these poor people?&quot; He also posted a picture of his son sitting inside a silver Porsche and added: &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh, reunited with my baby.", "Normal service can resume, once I have washed the stench of public transport off me FFS!&quot; In another, he published a picture of a Singaporean taxi driver and wrote: &quot;And today&apos;s cabbie retard award goes to \u2026 Mr Arm Warmers, stripy mittens &amp; towel on the lap man.", "In a statement released by his PR firm, he said: &quot;I would like to extend a sincere apology to the people of Singapore.", "&quot;I have the highest respect and regard for Singapore and the good people of Singapore; this is my home.&quot; Casey is a permanent resident of the city state."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-23T00:46:29Z", "title": "British banker receives death threats for anti-Singapore diatribe", "tags": ["Singapore", "Banking", "Business", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "A British banker has been forced to apologise to the people of Singapore after he complained he would have to &quot;wash the stench of public transport&quot; off himself during a period of separation from normal mode of transport \u2013 his Porsche.

So, yes, in many ways, London is a suburb of Paris and Paris is a suburb of London. If one takes a global vision, London and Paris are increasingly close. With Eurostar, London&apos;s St Pancras and the Gare du Nord are just over two hours apart. Ask a Chinese tourist and an American student touring Europe. Ask the numerous professionals who commute several times a week, if not every day. Ask an international investor or an entrepreneur looking for opportunities. Ask our youth who jump on the train to party across the Channel. People are increasingly linked and mobile. This narrows the distance between us. To use the term coined by sociologist Saskia Sassen, London and Paris are &quot;global cities&quot; or &quot;villes-monde&quot;. As such, they have links that go across national borders. These connections are the very source of our common strength. In a globalised world, the winners will be those who build networks. To be successful, let us avoid unnecessary parochialism. While drafting my programme for Paris 2020, I was inspired by the visions of other great cities \u2013 including London, New York, Singapore, Sydney and Vancouver. One striking feature of their visions is that many of the challenges, objectives and strategies are similar, if not identical. Some issues are localised, but we are all dealing with sustainable development, efficient transport systems, energy savings, innovation ecosystems, food supply, resilience ... All those long-term visions are based on pillars for which co-operation is vital. This is not to deny that our market economies are defined by competition \u2013 the City of London is a major financial centre competing with Paris&apos;s \u2013 but the future of our urban systems lies in the collaboration needed to adapt to the 21st century&apos;s challenges. As a parallel, think about the intensity of the entrepreneurial spirit within science parks and business incubators: the attitudes are competitive \u2013 becoming the best, the first, the fastest is a driver for excellence. However, it does not prevent people from collaborating on many issues. Partnership is actually the raison d&apos;\u00eatre of those structures and spaces. I look forward to the same degree of cross-fertilisation between our cities. We need to exchange ideas and best practices better, benchmark our results to see what works in all our majors concerns, from security to housing, through culture and tourism. The attractiveness of our cities ought to be a common goal, beyond slogans. In the competition of an increasingly connected world, the size and diversity of skills and resources will matter. From Tokyo, Shanghai, Lagos or Rio \u2013 cities that will have more than 20 million inhabitants by 2030 \u2013 Greater London and Paris Grand, with a combined population of 20 million, may well be seen as a single conurbation. Indeed, in this not-too-distant future, London and Paris together could be seen from Asia, Latin America or Africa as a solid partner, possessing a critical mass of resources to reckon with.

So I think it is just helping to market the sport in a way that hasn&apos;t been done before.&quot; Black pants and a coloured shirt are standard curling garb but the Norwegians took it to a new level at the last Games in Vancouver when they inadvertently created their own style. &quot;We received the black T-shirts and jackets from our [Norwegian curling] federation quite late and there were no pants to go with the set, so we decided to go ahead and find some more colourful pants to get some of the nation&apos;s colours in there; red, white and blue,&quot; says Svae. &quot;We just happened to find these diamond shaped, red, white and blue pants online and decided to buy them.&quot; The Norwegians won a silver in 2010 but afterwards on social media many believed Norway had won because of the blanket coverage they got for their trousers, Svae says. The Norwegians have since been sponsored by the British company that manufactured the trousers, Loudmouth Golf, and have been playing in every colour available. When they revealed their kit for next month&apos;s Sochi Olympics this week, their fans were not disappointed. &quot;We feel pretty good about it: it is just a way to make our sport popular and get into the media. I think it will be popular around the world and hopefully more people will come and check it out. So I feel we contribute on and off the ice. We are a pretty decent curling team \u2013 and also we have this going with the fashion,&quot; he says. However, Svae plays down any suggestion it will make a difference to their Olympic performance. &quot;I mean, obviously the first couple of days of the Olympics last time, people looked once or twice when we came on the ice in colourful pants. Now we have played like this for a while, so I don&apos;t think it gives us an advantage. &quot;When we feel good wearing a uniform we play better, so within the team it might have given us an advantage &quot;Right now we are focusing on the Olympics.

Could that really be true?&quot; There are various stories about this, and even Ince himself hasn&apos;t been consistent on the subject, so the best we can do, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is consider the evidence. Generally, the story goes that Ince arrived at Manchester United asking to go by the nickname he said he&apos;d had at West Ham: the Guv&apos;nor. And that&apos;s the way Steve Bruce told it in an interview with the Daily Express a few years ago. &quot;He liked to think he was the Guv&apos;nor,&quot; Bruce said, recalling the time that Ince brought an air rifle to poke through Alex Ferguson&apos;s door. Ah, office japes. &quot;It just showed you how much front and bottle he had to be called the Guv&apos;nor even when he first walked in the door. I just thought: &apos;Who&apos;s this cocky little thing from West Ham?&apos;&quot; Although Ince insists that he and the Manchester United manager never fell out, it&apos;s near impossible to talk about Ince&apos;s move to Internazionale without someone mentioning that Fergie called him not the Guv&apos;nor, but a &quot;fucking bottler&quot; and a &quot;big-time Charlie&quot; who&apos;d gotten too big for his boots. In his biography of Ferguson, Frank Worrall suggests that the final straw came when the two men arrived at Old Trafford at the same time and the door staff called Ince, not Ferguson, &quot;guv&quot; \u2013 eliciting a knowing wink from Ince. His number plate at the time (and possibly when he was at Liverpool, too) was GUV 8. &quot;We used to tease him about his nickname,&quot; Jamie Redknapp once said. &quot;He said he&apos;d never liked it, but it was on his car number plate.&quot; This was an inconsistency that Ince tried to scrub out in his account of the nickname in FourFourTwo in 2004. &quot;I used to play snooker with my mates in Dagenham,&quot; he explained, possibly while pulling on a pair of cor blimey trousers. &quot;When I hit a good shot, they used to shout, &apos;Who&apos;s the Guv&apos;nor?&apos; at me.

Me being me, I shouted out, &apos;Who&apos;s the Guv&apos;nor?&apos; and it stuck. &quot;I would say it when others scored a good goal too. Then all of a sudden Kiddo [Brian Kidd] called me &apos;Guv&apos;, and that&apos;s how it started. It maybe went a bit over the top as all the fans started calling me it too, and I had it on my car too. It was a little phase I went through. I hate being called it now, though.&quot; On the balance of probabilities, our money&apos;s on Bruce&apos;s version of events, but we&apos;re still taking evidence via knowledge@theguardian.com. DREAM STARTS &quot;Berwick Rangers&apos; new manger Colin Cameron had a dream start when Darren Lavery scored a goal after 14 seconds against Stirling Albion,&quot; says William Dods. &quot;Has any manager had a more auspicious start when managing a new team?&quot; &quot;I can&apos;t beat 14 seconds,&quot; says David Chalmers, &quot;but Jock Stein&apos;s managerial career got off to a flier. His first match, as manager of relegation-threatened Dunfermline Athletic in March 1960, saw the Pars score within 60 seconds, and beat Celtic 3-2. His second match saw Dunfermline 2-0 up after two minutes against St Mirren, and that was the final score. He won all of the remaining four matches that season and, not surprisingly, Dunfermline escaped the drop.&quot; Stein had a knack of getting off to a running start, winning his first matches as manager of Hibernian, Scotland and Celtic \u2013 his first match there in 1965 was a whalloping 6-0 win over Airdrie. Ian Holloway has a similar habit: his first match in charge at Crystal Palace in November 2012 was a 5-0 thrashing of Ipswich Town, a result that put them top of the Championship (having been bottom at the start of the season). When he won his first match as Leicester City manager by overseeing a 2-0 defeat of Bristol City, he was the club&apos;s first new manager to open with a win in more than 50 years. From Holloway to the Tottenham Hotspur legend Bill Nicholson, obviously. Nicholson&apos;s first game as manager came in October 1958, and a mere seven days after a 1-1 draw with not-long-to-be-relegated Portsmouth. Spurs had nine points from 11 matches; no one at White Hart Lane had gone expecting the new man to orchestrate a 10-4 pounding of Everton. Nicholson had only been appointed that morning, for pete&apos;s sake. It was 6-1 at half time. &quot;We won&apos;t win 10-4 every week, y&apos;know&quot; Tommy Harmer told the new manager after the game. Nicholson always believed in trying, mind. Any other nominations? You know where to send them. STRIKERS ON STRIKE &quot;At time of writing, Jozy Altidore has scored just two goals in 46 Premier League appearances,&quot; writes Callum O&apos;Toole. &quot;Is there any other striker in the league&apos;s history to have played more than 45 games and scored fewer goals than this?&quot; &quot;The name Carl Leaburn springs to mind,&quot; says David Haugen. &quot;Didn&apos;t he play at least 40 games in a row without scoring at Wimbledon?&quot; We&apos;re breaking the rules a bit here, because Leaburn actually scored three goals in his first four appearances for Wimbledon: two against Palace, as Wimbledon won 3-0, and the winner against Aston Villa a couple of weeks later. Before the end of the 1997-98 season, he scored another, the only one of the game against Southampton. But after that, the only thing he hit was a lengthy dry patch \u2013 he didn&apos;t score another league goal for the Dons, despite playing another two-and-a-bit seasons before leaving for Queens Park Rangers. Maybe the Independent&apos;s match report from that away win at Palace gives us a clue as to why, though: &quot;Two of the Wimbledon goals came from the head of Carl Leaburn, his first for the club,&quot; the report said, &quot;but he may have second thoughts about repeating the feat after having a hefty kiss plonked on his cheeks by Sam Hammam, his chairman, as the teams left the field.&quot; Or it could have been this bit: &quot;Leaburn will never have it so easy. On this awful form, Palace&apos;s first home Premier League win of the season looks as far away as ever.&quot; MORE MANAGERS CHOOSING THEIR SUCCESSORS Last week we looked at managers who had recommended the men who took over from them; Chris Storey has more. &quot;When Paul Simpson was headhunted away from Carlisle United by Preston North End in the summer of 2006, he recommended Neil McDonald as his successor; owner Fred Story took the advice and appointed McD.\u00a0 And a good choice he was as well, finishing eighth in League One only two years after struggling to get out of the Conference at the first attempt.\u00a0 Maybe as a Carlisle lad himself, Simpson didn&apos;t want to leave his hometown club in the lurch.&quot; KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE &quot;What&apos;s the weirdest kick-off anyone&apos;s ever seen?&quot; inquired Daniel Perry back in 2005. One of the more memorable kick-offs is Scotland&apos;s World Cup qualifier in Estonia in 1996. After Fifa ordered the match to be brought forward by three hours because of inadequate floodlights, the home side refused to turn up (citing insufficient notice), leaving Scotland with no opposition \u2013 and they still didn&apos;t win. The game kicked off on the stroke of 3pm, when Billy Dodds passed to John Collins \u2013 three seconds before referee Miroslav Radoman blew to end the farce. Despite Estonia&apos;s behaviour, Fifa ordered the match to be replayed, when the Scots were held 0-0 in Monaco. And remember last season&apos;s Carling Cup first-round meeting between Yeovil and Plymouth Argyle? After defender Graham Coughlan sustained an injury, Lee Johnson&apos;s attempt to return the ball to Pilgrims goalkeeper Luke McCormick failed spectacularly, the ball accidentally sailing into the net. Yeovil responded by allowing Argyle striker Stevie Crawford to take the kick-off unchallenged, run all the way from the centre circle and put the ball into an empty net. The honourable gesture must have been good karma: Johnson went on to complete a hat-trick and secure his side victory. Equally embarrassed by a kick-off mishap was the Cambridge United striker Carlo Corazzin, according to Clive Vedmore: &quot;In about 1994, he was booked after taking the kick-off incorrectly \u2013 Carlo didn&apos;t seem to understand that the ball has to go forward and kept tapping it backwards. After three or four attempts at retaking the kick-off, the official finally had enough and booked him. I think the ref got another player to restart in the end.&quot; Even more comical was the goal Hans-Jorg Butt conceded for Bayer Leverkusen in his side&apos;s 3-2 win at Schalke in April 2004. Celebrating scoring his side&apos;s third goal just that little too much, the penalty-taking goalkeeper failed to notice the referee return the ball to Schalke; Ebbe Sand played the ball to Mike Hanke, who fired into the empty net from the halfway line. &quot;I didn&apos;t think the referee would allow them to kick off so quickly,&quot; admitted the red-faced Butt later. However, trumping all of these tales is Jan Egil Romestrand, who recalls a Norwegian local cup derby between Surnadal and Sunndal in April 2000. &quot;While the game flowed back and forth, caution got the better of each team,&quot; he explains. &quot;The full-time score was 0-0 and the first half of extra-time was goalless as well. At this point, Surnadal goalkeeper Olav Kare Fiske had a certain urge and, as the teams regrouped during the half-time break, he succumbed and sought relief behind his left goalpost. &quot;Sadly, he underestimated his own capacity and his irrigation of the land was not finished when the referee decided the half-time break was. The whistle went and Sunndal striker Tor Oddvar Torve took a speculative punt directly from kick-off. With the goalkeeper still handling his unfinished business, he could do nothing but look over his shoulder as the ball sailed into the empty net. While a protest duly ensued, the referee did not crack and awarded the goal. Sunndal went on to secure the 1-0 win and the right to enter the HM King&apos;s Cup Championship.&quot; For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.

The latest Unesco Education for All global monitoring report, published Wednesday, underlines how far we still are from guaranteeing a good quality education for every child. While many pupils are now attending school, the quality of the education is often so poor that they are failing to learn the most elementary skills. Around 175 million young people in poor countries \u2013 equivalent to one quarter of the youth population \u2013 cannot read all or part of a sentence. The situation for girls is particularly dire. If current trends continue, it will take until 2072 for all the poorest young women in developing countries to become literate. In other words, it will only be the grandchildren of today&apos;s pupils in sub-Saharan Africa that can expect to learn the skills that the developed world takes for granted. Though the subject of improving education in the region could keep conference organisers in business for years, the overwhelming problem outlined in the report is simple: the availability of teachers and the quality of teaching. Over the last few years, there has been much excitable talk about Africa being on the cusp of an economic renaissance. But this will amount to another lost opportunity if the number of teachers is not increased to cope with the continent&apos;s exploding young population. Worldwide, 8.2 million new teachers need to be recruited by 2015 (pdf). If they are not, then Sub-Saharan Africa will be the worst affected region. The quality of teachers is equally important. In a third of countries analysed by the report, less than three-quarters of primary school teachers are trained to national standards. In West Africa, where the teaching of basic skills is particularly poor, over half the teachers have little formal training and are on low-paid temporary contracts. Poor pay results in many teachers earning supplementary income through second jobs, or running family businesses, when they should be in the classroom. This culture has been allowed to develop because there is little accountability: independent observers do not regularly inspect schools, and teachers do not have to prove their competence in the classroom after they have been hired. There is, of course, no simple solution to this litany of problems. But the Education for All report is right that developing countries must attract the best candidates into teaching and incentivise them to stay. When governments have to choose whether to spend education budgets on new facilities or the salaries of teachers, there&apos;s a good argument that spending on attracting teachers will yield the most tangible results. Peter Dolton from LSE has proven that there&apos;s a clear link between the level of teachers pay and the quality of a country&apos;s educational outcomes. Those countries that are in the upper-reaches of the Pisa rankings \u2013 South Korea, Finland, Singapore \u2013 all make an effort to recruit the best graduates and often demand that entrants to the profession have a second degree. With many competing demands on fragile states \u2013 to build roads, provide healthcare and provide a welfare safety net \u2013 it&apos;s unrealistic to expect that governments can provide the additional education provision required by Africa&apos;s youth bulge alone. If managed well, partnerships with the private sector can bring in the investment to build schools quickly and import international expertise. For instance, entrepreneur James Tooley has pioneered school places in Ghana for 65 cents per day \u2013 including a school uniform, a hot lunch and work books \u2013 which is within reach of regular families. Most importantly, we must raise the status of teaching. This isn&apos;t just a problem in developing countries. In a survey in 21 different countries on which profession the public thought was comparable with teaching, it was only in China that people thought that the status of teachers was similar to that of doctors. Unsurprisingly, with such attitudes towards teachers, Shanghai topped the 2012 Pisa rankings. And it&apos;s not just about teacher pay. We must culturally value teaching \u2013 seeing it not simply as a worthy vocation but as a job for the highly skilled that is essential to our future. Without that, we will condemn more generations to leave school unable to read to the end of a sentence. Vikas Pota is chief executive of the Varkey GEMS Foundation.

It announced a far-reaching new policy commitment \u2013 no deforestation, no exploitation, no peatland development in any of its business. Shared with only a handful of journalists because of the late hour, it was only in the US where filing deadlines had not yet passed that the news filtered out. Picked up here and there in the subsequent days, it made no real bang in the global media, quite different from the worldwide interest when pulp and paper giant Asia Pulp and Paper made a similar announcement ten months earlier. Wilmar&apos;s commitment represents the latest but also by far the most significant &quot;no deforestation&quot; commitment yet. It has the legs to create a global revolution in how we grow food. No deforestation commitments spring from the logic that deforestation is driven by businesses sucking it through supply chains, that forests are destroyed to grow raw materials such as palm oil, soy, beef and wood fibre. Embedded in products made with the raw materials, deforestation drives climate change, species loss, and human rights violations. Thus, to solve it, we need to block the pipeline for deforestation-linked products and instead produce raw materials without destroying forests. &quot;If your product contains deforestation, I will not buy it&quot; is a powerful deterrent. It&apos;s also a powerful incentive to disengage from deforestation, exploitation or peatland clearance \u2013 &quot;desist and I&apos;ll buy your entire stock&quot;. Nestl\u00e9 deserves special mention for making the first no deforestation commitment in December 2009 when its Chairman committed that no Nestl\u00e9 product would cause deforestation. Attacked by Greenpeace for links to deforestation in its palm oil procurement, Nestl\u00e9 announced No Deforestation Responsible Sourcing Guidelines for the palm oil and pulp and paper it buys in May 2010. Indonesia&apos;s largest and the world&apos;s second ranked palm oil grower, Golden Agri Resources, made its own commitment, mirroring Nestle&apos;s policy, in February 2011. Asia Pulp and Paper followed in February 2013, then Neste Oil (the biofuel giant) in April 2013, Ferrero in November 2013, Reckitt Benckiser in December 2013 and now Wilmar. Unilever, Delhaize, E Leclerc supermarkets and others have made policy commitments enshrining the no deforestation concept. The Consumer Goods Forum, comprising 400 member companies, many with links to deforestation through beef, palm oil, soy and pulp and paper, made their own commitment in November 2010 to &quot;no net deforestation&quot; by 2020. The CGF, in partnership with the governments of the US, UK, Netherlands and Norway as well as some NGOs, then formed the Tropical Forest Alliance to help move the commitment from policy to implementation. The Government of Indonesia hosted the first TFA meeting in June 2013. This looks like positive action, a growing push. Yet deforestation continues. Wilmar&apos;s commitment has the potential to change that. Wilmar is the world&apos;s largest palm oil company; it controls some 45% of the market. Estimates suggest it buys from 80% of all palm oil growers. With its new policy, those growers will have to stop cutting down forests, stop exploiting people and stop clearing peatlands. Implementing the policy will not be straightforward. We&apos;ve recently seen concerns from Forest People&apos;s Programme that Golden Agri&apos;s implementation in Indonesia has not respected community customary rights. The focus is now on fixing that but the reality is that we&apos;re in very new ground here. No one has ever sought to protect forests, respect community rights and run a profitable business on this scale before in an industry famous for focusing solely on profits. Wilmar&apos;s Chairman spoke eloquently and passionately recently at Davos where he noted that the younger generation of plantation growers had received the policy commitments positively. There had been an expectation of large-scale push back. That hasn&apos;t happened yet and it raises the hope that the snowball has started to roll downhill. Even more significantly, questions are already being asked about other commodities, &quot;If we can grow palm like this, what about soy, beef, pulp and paper, cocoa, sugar?&quot; The fascinating thing about these policy commitments is that they are predicated on the very simple idea that a buyer can work with suppliers to specify broadly defined qualities \u2013 ethical specifications like no forests destroyed, and no people exploited and so go beyond traditional technical specs like colour, strength, price and so on. No tortuous UN resolutions needed, good practice is rewarded; food is grown in a different way, let the multi-trillion dollar food market work. Wilmar going for it has set a new threshold for responsible food production. Yes, the company has to work through the challenges of implementation but there is real hope that with this germ of an idea, this relatively new approach to saving forests and respecting people, we just might be witnessing the final, beautiful unfolding of a butterfly&apos;s wings. Its subsequent flight could indeed change the world. Scott Poynton is executive director of the Forest Trust Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

One of my testers boasted of her considerable experience in the field in Thailand; another thought the origins were Indonesian \u2013 then backtracked, asking: &quot;Actually, is it Malaysian?&quot; I had to admit that I wasn&apos;t quite sure \u2013 the Oxford Companion to Food credits it to all three, but notes that food writer Jennifer Brennan names Java as the place where the Indian kebab, imported by Muslim traders, first took on a distinctly more eastern feel. Unsurprisingly, then, even though all satay involves grilled meat skewers, the marinades and accompanying sauces vary considerably \u2013 which made choosing between them a tough task. (I was relieved to find none resembled the reformed, oddly juicy sort that come along with a little sachet of peanut butter sauce, still sold at supermarket deli counters.) Those based in Britain will probably be grateful for the news that, although in an ideal world satay would be cooked over a smoky charcoal grill, at this time of year a smoking-hot griddle pan proves a pretty decent substitute. In fact, it gives a better flavour than the kerosene-heavy ones I had in Singapore a few years ago. The meat     David Thompson's satay.    Thigh is the most popular choice, given the juicier meat has more chance of standing up to the scorching heat. French chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who has worked in Asia for many years, serves a breast-meat satay at the Spice Market, his south-east Asian restaurant. Rick Stein suggests a mixture of breast and thigh in his Far Eastern Odyssey. I&apos;m not convinced: the breast, though pleasant enough, is definitely duller than the thigh, which offers a multitude of sensory pleasures. American food writer James Oseland advises: &quot;When making satay, it is best to retain some of the fat with the chicken thigh. When grilled, the fat keeps the meat moist and sometimes bits and pieces of them becomes crunchy, thus adding texture and smokiness to the meat.&quot; This may or may not explain why one of my testers describes one particularly well-larded skewer as tasting &quot;like KFC. But better.&quot; Marinade     Jean-Georges Vongerichtren's satay.    The difference really comes in the marinades, which range from the wonderfully simple \u2013 Rosemary Brissenden&apos;s garlic, ginger and light soy sauce version in South East Asian Food \u2013 to the fiendishly complex: Vongerichten&apos;s involves 11 ingredients, David Thompson&apos;s Thai Street Food and Saveur magazine10 apiece, almost all of which require toasting or chopping and grinding before use. Spice-wise, I like the fresh flavour of the coriander Saveur, Thompson and Vongerichten use \u2013 toasting the seeds and grinding them fresh, as the latter two suggest, brings out their flavour \u2013 but I don&apos;t find that cumin, fennel, turmeric and chilli add much. I do like Stein&apos;s black pepper, though, and his wonderfully zesty kaffir lime leaves, which, like the lemongrass used by Thompson, imbue the chicken with a lovely perfumed freshness.     Saveur's satay.    Indeed, after tasting five varieties, ranging from the sweet and fruity (Vongerichten) to the exotically coconutty (Thompson), I come down in favour of this delicately aromatic flavour: the shallots used by Vongerichten and Stein can be saved for the sauce, as can the coconut, and, of course, the peanuts. I&apos;ll be leaving out Vongerichten&apos;s condensed milk, however: palm sugar does the job nicely. No substitute is required for his whisky, which is a rather puzzling addition. Vongerichten and Stein use shallots in the marinade, but I think a generous quantity of garlic works better, along with ginger for sweetness. As a balance, some soy sauce \u2013 Stein&apos;s syrupy Indonesian kecap manis, and ordinary salty stuff \u2013 works wonders. Time     Rick Stein's satay.    Saveur&apos;s recipe demands four hours in the marinade, Thompson specifies at least an hour, Brissenden 30 minutes, Stein at least 10 and Vongerichten sticks the meat straight on the grill. I&apos;m surprised how little difference it makes: the flavour comes through on Vongerichten&apos;s meat almost as clearly as the Saveur version. Half an hour seems a happy medium, but if you don&apos;t have the time, it&apos;s no disaster. Sauce     Rosemary Brissdenden's satay.    This is another area of contention: while all the sauces are peanut-based, Thompson&apos;s coconut cream and lemongrass version is sweet, rich and, yes, coconutty, while Stein&apos;s, with its kecap manis and two types of chillies, is savoury and spicy. Vongerichten bases his on red curry paste, whereas Stein and Brissenden add lime juice and shrimp paste for a rather more bracing effect. Stein&apos;s reminder that the sauce should be be sweet, sour, salty and spicy is a good one: palm sugar and coconut milk, kecap manis, lime juice and chilli will be the dominant flavours in my version \u2013 along with the peanut, of course. At the risk of infuriating lovers of authentic satay, I disagree with all the recipes over texture. Finely ground is fine for peanut butter, but my testers agree that they prefer the chunky sort I&apos;ve left in Stein&apos;s sauce as an experiment, which gives it a far more interesting texture. Feel free to grind them if you prefer a more traditional version. Most of the sauces are also rather too thick at room temperature, but they&apos;re easily loosened with a little water or a dash more coconut milk for your dipping pleasure.

Toast the coriander seeds in a dry pan until fragrant, and then grind to a powder in a pestle and mortar. Add the garlic, ginger, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves and pound to a rough paste along with a generous grinding of black pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and stir in the oil, kecap manis and soy sauce. Cut the chicken into long strips about 3cm wide and stir into the marinade, mixing well. Cover, refrigerate and leave to marinade for at least 30 minutes if you&apos;ve got it, and up to 12 hours. Soak eight wooden skewers in cold water until ready to use. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the chillies, shallots, garlic and shrimp paste in a pestle and mortar, or the small bowl of a food processor, and pound or blitz to a paste. Heat the oil in a wok or wide frying pan, and then fry the paste until it smells cooked. Add the coconut milk and palm sugar and simmer for a couple of minutes, then add the peanuts and simmer until slightly thickened. Stir in the kecap manis and lime juice, add a little water or coconut milk if it&apos;s too thick, then taste to check the balance of flavours; add more lime juice, sugar or soy sauce if you think it&apos;s lacking. Serve warm or at room temperature. Thread the strips of meat onto the skewers in an &quot;S&quot; shape, pushing them down so they&apos;re all touching. Cook the skewers on a barbecue, or a griddle pan over a medium-high heat, for about 20 minutes until cooked through, turning regularly.

Most budget airlines fly from smaller airports to cut costs, but they&apos;re further from town, and have less of the expected attractions. My colleagues and I weren&apos;t taking risks. Arriving early for a flight is standard procedure, but in this case, time was on our side. Perhaps a little too much. Check-in desks were 20 metres from the entrance. The baggage scanners were 20 metres to the right, shielded from the public only by frosted glass. My workmates and I got through all the stops in 10 minutes, and were left not knowing what had just happened. We had spent days constantly under stress for work, and now because of the efficiency in this tiny airport we had to endure each other for much longer than expected. Sure, there were some restaurants and shops to browse, and they were diligently browsed with haste \u2013 again, from habit. There was only so much of the magazine bookshelf and Toblerone bars one can gaze at before getting antsy, and I couldn&apos;t for the life of me figure out why. Airports are expected to be modern, grandiose in size, and filled with a variation of duty-free stores that make you wonder if you&apos;ve stepped into a Westfield. Singapore&apos;s Changi airport has almost 100 restaurants, bars and cafes in its terminals. Some locals take the journey to the airport for a place to eat out \u2013 and why not? With a playground for the kids and even a cinema, these amenities score big points. But Tegel airport is a world away from Changi, and without the added pressure of toe-tapping through baggage check-in, peeking over shoulders waiting for security and groaning at border control, a large chunk of stress had just disappeared. Heck, the distance from the taxi to my gate would&apos;ve been short enough for a climactic romantic comedy moment to actually occur, unlike those poor souls who try running through US airports for love, to no avail. In bigger airports, the environment around you prompts an urge to do something productive during the wait. But others provide a single overpriced cafe (instead of multiple overpriced restaurants), and just enough duty free to claim that both wine and spirits are available. Some airports seem like (and sometimes are) mere tin sheds. With no opportunity to wander around in a lethargic trance, there&apos;s less inclination to spend on more gifts, pay for exchange rates you tried for days to avoid or eat before a flight with free food. The windows become viewing stations to stare out of \u2013 transfixed by every small jet that magically lifts from the ground carrying tonnes of travellers and trinkets. Likewise, when the building cuts off your 3G access, and payment options for Wi-Fi seem unreasonable, life forces you to look elsewhere for entertainment. The book that you&apos;ve insistently carried with you becomes a gift for moments like these. The sole traveller sitting to your left \u2013 with a carry-on backpack that heaves at the struggling seams holding it together \u2013 becomes a welcome conversation for travel stories you would never dream of experiencing yourself. The worst feeling after a wonderful week on holiday is being so wound up from the bits and pieces that come from a visit to an airport that the joy and tranquillity earned simply wash away. Instead, imagine your comfy chair at home, or what you&apos;re going to cook once you get there. By all means, feel free to pull out that camera and flick through photos taken just hours ago. Take the time to appreciate the moment, and relax. The last thing your colleagues want to hear from you first is about the airport. \u2022 This article was commissioned after a suggestion from mattpointblank"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jan/31/chip-spending-chromebook", "sentences": ["Singapore&apos;s self-driving car makes Google&apos;s version an unnecessary luxury &gt;&gt; Tech In Asia Terence Lee:   a team in Singapore has successfully developed their own self-driving car prototype at under half the cost [of Google&apos;s] \u2013 just S$30,000 ($23,500) for two off-the-shelf Lidar sensors and an onboard computer which are mounted onto a conventional vehicle.", "The team, comprising of 12 researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), hopes to bring the cost down to S$10,000 ($7,800) eventually.", "Singapore could really do with self-driving cars."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-31T07:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: chip spending, recommending Chromebooks, cheaper self-driving, and more", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Apple and Samsung lord over field once again as top OEMs in semiconductor spending for 2013 &gt;&gt; IHS iSuppli  As in 2012, Apple and Samsung were the top semiconductor spenders in 2013 among original equipment manufacturers (OEM) making more than $1bn in revenue,&quot; said Myson Robles-Bruce,\u00a0senior analyst for semiconductor spend and design analysis at IHS. &quot;Apple was in first place with chip spending in 2013 of $30.3bn, outspending runner-up Samsung&apos;s $22.2bn by more than $8 billion.

November 2008: Apple iPhone doomed to failure - Windows Mobile 7 plans for 2009 leaked &gt;&gt; Network World Mitchell Ashley in November 2008:   Too many major players are in the mobile phone market, who have and will bring iPhone-like products to market over the coming months and years. LG has already done so with the LG Voyager phone, and now Microsoft&apos;s plans for Windows Mobile 7 OS have been leaked and described in considerable detail by Inside Microsoft blogger Nathan Weinberg. With many features dubbed &quot;iPhone compete&quot;, WM7 is all about effective uses of the touch screen, finger gestures, and additional motion gestures. Microsoft&apos;s put a lot of thought into how to make the mobile phone interface more intuitive and easier to use, even more so than Apple&apos;s iPhone.  Apple has never had a product, or a year, when it hasn&apos;t been &quot;doomed to failure&quot;. MacBook Touch &gt;&gt; All this Dr Drang:   A couple of weeks ago, I got to do the kind of observation that user interface experts like to do. I was at a high school swim meet, in the stands a few rows behind a dad who was working on a touchscreen notebook computer between his son&apos;s events. In between my son&apos;s events and checking my email and Twitter, I could look down and see how he used the machine. What I saw is only one data point, but it represents real-world use, not the somewhat artificial use of a test subject who knows he&apos;s a test subject. The action I saw again and again was him reaching up to touch a button or a menu, bringing his hand away, and then going back to touch the screen again because he missed the target. He was pretty patient about it, which suggests it was behaviour he was used to. Had it been me, I would have flung the damned thing into the pool. This is exactly what [Apple software chief Craig] Federighi was talking about. Targets in Windows\u2014which is what the man was using, of course\u2014and OS X aren&apos;t designed to be hit with a finger. They&apos;re designed to be hit with the much more precise tip of a mouse pointer.  Expand the targets, and you lose space for content. Ultra-portable PCs top 12% of notebook market in 2013, says ABI Research &gt;&gt; Digitimes  An estimated 12.3% (22.5m) of the notebook shipments in 2013 (182.7m) fit into the ultra-portable segment, according to market intelligence firm ABI Research. The year-on-year growth of ultra-portables reached 100% from 2012 to 2013.  That includes Apple&apos;s MacBook Air, which probably accounts for around 8m of those (Apple sold a total of 17m PCs in 2013). Ultrabooks are looking like something of a niche for Windows buyers. Total PC sales in 2013 were 315m.

It happens with debates on diet, frequently with childcare and diseases, occasionally with sex and reproduction. &quot;Of course,&quot; the person will say, with an air of putting an end to all discussion, &quot;humans evolved in the palaeolithic era. Physiologically and psychologically, we are hunter-gatherers.&quot; I was sitting in a hut in the highlands of Papua New Guinea and \u2013 can you believe it? \u2013 the old couple sitting by the fire reached for the stone age. The only difference was that this couple were speaking from personal experience: they were born in it. &quot;When the first white people appeared, we were very frightened,&quot; said the woman, Keira. &quot;We picked up our pigs and ran to the jungle to hide.&quot; &quot;They were Australians, I think,&quot; said the man, Daniel. &quot;After them came the Japanese and made the men work.&quot; This all happened during the second world war, when the Japanese used slave labour to construct fortifications, even here at 3,000 metres up in the wilds of the central mountains. Once they left, the missionaries arrived. I came to Namasaro after trekking in from a neighbouring village which is on the road from the central highland town of Goroka. The road doesn&apos;t yet reach Namasaro, but it soon will, and I was keen to see it before the changes that easy communication will bring. I&apos;d read Jared Diamond&apos;s enthralling new book, The World Until Yesterday, and was intrigued to see a community poised between palaeolithic yesterday and modern today: the former taking up most of our human past while the latter is but the blink of an eye. In my country, I told Keira and Daniel, some people think it must be good to live like you once did: without guns, Christianity or TV. They looked surprised to hear this and Daniel was keen to put me right: &quot;It was a bad time. We men had to guard against attack at all times. Our neighbours were our enemies. We built watchtowers and fences. It wasn&apos;t good.&quot; But Keira disagreed: &quot;It was better then. We wore beautiful things and there was more singing and dancing.&quot;     Approaching Namasaro on the trail from Garoka    The village has not developed a\u00a0great deal, at least not from what I\u00a0could see. It was spread along a narrow mountain ridge with deep, jungle-clad gorges on either side, a location chosen for defensive reasons in ancient times. There was no electricity or running water. The main visible sign of modernity was the abandoned playing cards scattered all around: the entire village is addicted to card games. As for clothes, the older people seemed to wear what the missionaries, Anglican and Adventist, told them is decent: baggy floral print smocks and cast-off American T-shirts. Accessorizing, however, is a deep instinct, obviously palaeolithic: a purple Astrakhan hat, a day-glo string bag, an emerald-green beaded headband \u2013 no, wait a minute, those were the wing cases of beetles. The younger people were more up on western mores: sunglasses, baggy jeans and dreadlocks. Footwear? Forget it. No shoe could contain these broad, jungle-hardened feet. Magnificent feet: they made my lily- white appendages feel like the useless bound monstrosities of a Ming dynasty Chinese maiden. I tripped over roots and struggled to find toeholds on steep inclines. These people had no such trouble: nimble and sure-footed, they never stumbled. When I arrived here, after a day&apos;s trek through the jungle, old ladies rushed forward and gently rugby-tackled me at knee level. &quot;Nice boy!&quot; they kept cooing. Everyone had to then shake hands, literally everyone, all 400 of them. We processed along the ridge from group to group and my guide, Samuel, explained who I was. Not that this had to be done often, because everyone here talks constantly to everyone and so, by the time I reached the end of the village, they already knew who I was and what interested me. &quot;Ah, Kevin,&quot; said one stout stranger with the muscles of an ageing prize-fighter. &quot;There&apos;s a bird on that tree you could photograph.&quot; My name had been passed along correctly, I noted, as had my possession of a camera and my interest in wildlife. Games of Chinese whispers would not go down well here. I took the photograph. A small boy sidled up with a catapult: &quot;Do you want us to kill it now?&quot;     A couple outside their hut in Namasaro    One of the first groups I was introduced to were The Lads: a gang of youths who live together in a hut at the end of the village, a traditional arrangement for teenage males. I was going to stay with them that night. They asked a lot of questions about England and &quot;our Queen Elizabeth&quot;, who is incredibly popular in Papua New Guinea. I tried to explain why I had never met the woman, how difficult it would be to make contact. &quot;She has guards and there&apos;s a huge fence around her house.&quot; I could see they thought I was joking. Guards and fences? It sounded like the stone age. &quot;I will go to her and say happy noon,&quot; said one of them, &quot;Then she will give me a job.&quot; In Namasaro, if you want to talk to someone, you walk up to them and begin a conversation. There is no such thing as privacy. The idea is incomprehensible. The houses have only one room and everyone just grabs a sleeping mat and lies where there is a space. In the lads&apos; hut I\u00a0had been honoured with a wooden cot and mosquito net but everyone else just collapsed on the floor in a heap. Whenever I thought the place must be full, the door would creak open and someone else would throw themselves on the pile. I began to feel a\u00a0bit awkward, taking up so much room in my cot. On Sunday morning a few people were wandering around clutching bibles but no one seemed bothered about starting anything like a service. Besides, there was going to be a &quot;sing-sing&quot; and that was much more interesting. A group of old people had started changing into their traditional costumes and I could hear the laughter and shouts of glee. Eventually they all emerged and sat in a loose circle to sing. I sat with them, taking photos. The old ladies of earlier now seemed decades younger; the men had become dashing warriors. They chanted together, all seated, then began a stamping droning song out on the muddy terrace overlooking the valley. The young men watched but did not take part.     A Namasaro villager    When it was over, and it was time to start trekking back to the road where we would wait for a minibus to take us back to Goroka, a group of The Lads came along. They wanted to show me the special forest birds that live around them: we spotted the bird of paradise first, then the Princess Stephanie&apos;s astrapia, both astounding creatures revealed by sharp jolts of electric-blue feathers in the jungle. After a long walk and a wait, a\u00a0lorry came along and I was offered a lift. But The Lads had a last urgent question. One of them came forward as spokesman. &quot;Answer me: true or false,&quot; he said. &quot;Is the movie Braveheart true history?&quot; I was taken aback. &quot;You watch films?&quot; &quot;There&apos;s a generator, and we watch on Sundays. What about Braveheart?&quot; I pondered. &quot;Yes, I think the story is basically true.&quot; They all sighed with evident satisfaction. &quot;We love that movie,&quot; said another. &quot;We cry a lot.&quot; We waved goodbye and the lorry pulled away down the track. Perhaps, I reflected, despite all the changes that progress brings, good and bad, it is one step forward when real tribal violence becomes just a film about it. \u2022 The trip was arranged by the Papua New Guinea Tourism Promotion Authority (papuanewguinea.travel).

Not only do they have double Grammy-winner Lorde playing, but the bill also boasts Vance Joy, who beat her to No 1 in the Triple J Hottest 100 last weekend. Add to that the vertiginously fast-rising Haim and Chvrches and painfully hip acts like King Krule, Earl Sweatshirt and Parquet Courts, and you&apos;ve got a festival that couldn&apos;t be more 2014 if it tried.  Laneway has only been going 11 years, but has carved out a deserved reputation as the place to see bands who are on the way up. Originating in Melbourne, it now travels around Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, and even had a foray to Detroit last year, a journey it intends to repeat. Compared to the likes of Big Day Out, Laneway is a minnow (its capacity in Sydney, where it travels on Sunday, is only 12,000), but it punches far above its weight. In a wobbly festival market, it&apos;s focused on a young audience hungry for new music \u2013 the bill is notably free of the heritage acts on which other festivals have come to rely. As a proportion, it also has far more women musicians than other festivals tend to book.  So does it work? Arriving way too early at 11.30am, the record stall is replete with vinyl and the clothes racks are stuffed with tat \u2013 sorry, top quality vintage garments. There&apos;s free sunscreen, free water and even a barbers, ominously run by a rum company. There are four stages, spaced sufficiently far apart that the sound doesn&apos;t bleed. In other words, it&apos;s well run, but focused firmly on the bands. It&apos;s not Burning Man or Glastonbury.  The first band on are the Creases, &quot;unearthed&quot; by Triple J, whose playlist seems to dovetail neatly with Laneway&apos;s booking policy. From Brisbane, the Creases have already had a single out on the UK&apos;s celebrated indie label Rough Trade, and have both tunes and a pleasingly sleazy melancholia about them which recalls both the Strokes and Lou Reed. Glamour isn&apos;t their strong point \u2013 the guitarist is wearing a hat with corks on \u2013 but their improvised solution is worse than the problem. A few songs in, they invite their lanky guitar tech onto the stage, who is wearing denim hot pants and not much else. He camps around in incredibly distracting style, particularly when his foot goes on the monitor and the boys almost come out of the barracks. It&apos;s a shame to overshadow such mouthwatering melodies as Fall Guy with the sight of two long, hairy legs. There&apos;s no such misfiring stagecraft over on the Carpark stage, where Cass McCombs is finishing his set. While There Can Be Only One is on the verge of going into the realms of Dire Straits, the following song, which takes in a shuffle rhythm, hi-life guitar and a doo-wop-style chord sequence, shows that McCombs has the ability to conjure up a twilight atmosphere even at lunchtime.  Back at the Alexandria Street stage, where the Creases played, Fremantle&apos;s the Growl are strutting their stuff. Being from Western Australia, the shark cull is clearly uppermost in their minds \u2013 they&apos;ve written &quot;stop culling sharks&quot; on the bass drum. The bearded singer has charisma \u2013 he looks a bit like Jim Morrison in his drinking days \u2013 but the double bass, Hammond organ (well, synthesizer impersonating one) and blues chord changes make it as retro as the Sailor Jerry&apos;s run being spruiked all over the site \u2013 and for me, rather less intoxicating. Passing by the Zoo stage, the young, British two-piece Drenge are battering the hell out of their instruments (guitar and drums), showing that you don&apos;t need much more than the judicious application of some pedals to make a truly overwhelming sound. Known to casual listeners in the UK thanks to the unlikely patronage of Labour MP Tom Watson, they&apos;re soon to embark on a British tour with the Creases, and while they don&apos;t have the latter&apos;s tunes, they certainly win when it comes to mesmerising stage presence \u2013 not to mention brute force. Compared to them, their fellow Brit King Krule is a disappointment. A slight young man with red hair, flowing grey clothes and a Jafaican-inflected voice that sounds like he&apos;s been gargling lava, he should add up to something extraordinary. Sadly, despite intriguing hints of what might happen if you fused the Smiths with dub reggae, the killer melody eludes him, and a lot of his songs simply end up evaporating without trace \u2013 though his testifying, spoken-word intro to The Krokodil lingers in the memory. Back on the Zoo stage, it&apos;s time for some Aussies in the shape of Melbourne&apos;s Dick Diver, who have a hilarious line in banter thanks to their outraged fixation with Clive Palmer (&quot;Rupert&apos;s twerked with Palmer&apos;s brontosaurus&quot; they claim), the ability to swap instruments, a fine if perhaps underused line in harmonies, and a take on indie rock which is traditional yet refreshing, a highlight being the mildly insurrectionary Head Back. Towards the end they&apos;re told that they have another 15 minutes on stage and threaten to perform Truly, Madly, Deeply by Savage Garden. They&apos;re funny, subversive and addictive.  Outside a host of eager young fans are waiting for Vance Joy, whose Riptide is now an international hit as well as unexpectedly scooping the Triple J Hottest 100 crown from Royals. Riptide is pretty irresistible and gets a massive singalong when Joy plays it as the final song, as well as two women clambering atop their friends&apos; shoulders and hoisting off their bras (Joy the gentleman doesn&apos;t mention it, or indeed look in their direction). Over a whole set however, his shortcomings become obvious. Almost everything seems to start with an acoustic verse before the four-on-the-four drum stomp kicks in, and some of the lyrics wobble over the line between charming and twee \u2013 particularly the one about wearing socks in bed. That said, it&apos;s remarkable to think how early Joy is in his career \u2013 he hasn&apos;t even put an album out yet, and thanks to Riptide his post-Mumfords folk is now firmly turbocharged and pointed in the direction marked &quot;ubiquity&quot;.      Haim salute the crowd at Laneway Photograph: Aaron Webber/Public domain    Back on the Carpark stage, Daughter are coming across like a British Beach House, dressed in black and muffling their drum kit in order to make it sound the more portentous, as the guitar arpeggios chime. It all comes together on the song Youth, which is warm and embracing rather than chilly and austere. &quot;Thanks for being so beautiful,&quot; says singer Elena Tonra bashfully as they leave the stage.  Vance Joy&apos;s ukelele safely stowed away, a bouncing synthesizer bass throb heralds the arrival of Chvrches. The crowd barely dissipate; Australia has taken the Glaswegian synth trio to its collective heart, with their three singles to date all appearing in the Triple J Hot 100. The highlight of the set is Lies, whose Gary Numan synth strut sounds exhilarating after Joy&apos;s hay-chewing folk, but Chvrches have plenty of songs which fuse rock dynamics with synth pop sounds in the way that made Depeche Mode world famous. At the very least, they&apos;re picking up where La Roux left off. They&apos;re also engagingly eccentric-looking, with their cool and short-clad singer Lauren Mayberry flanked by her two male bandmates, who are both sweatily throwing shapes like they&apos;re in Limp Bizkit. By the end of their set, someone has unfurled a Saltire in their honour. Haim are an even more in-your-face proposition, and their set is as exhilarating as you&apos;d hope judging by the ridiculously orgasmic faces pulled by bassist Este Haim. It&apos;s also \u2013 crucially \u2013 well paced, sprinkling the hits evenly through the 45 minutes allotted and also leaving room for a rambunctious cover of Fleetwood Mac&apos;s Oh Yeah. Haim&apos;s set reminds us that the sight and sound of young women wrestling massive guitars while thrashing their hair around is a glorious one, and their songs, often overly manicured on record, are enjoyably roughed up by axe heroics from Danielle Haim. It all culminates in Let Me Go&apos;s full-on Burundi drumming session, plus a demand to go to a beach party.  Half the crowd would undoubtedly leave then and there to hit the surf with Haim were it not for Lorde supplanting them on the stage. (Both bands also unfairly clash with Savages, whose rock hard neo-punk is sounding wonderfully forbidding on the Zoo Stage.) Lorde&apos;s &quot;band&quot; consists a lone man in a silver suit standing deep in the shadows and prodding at a computer while Lorde performs her now celebrated jerky dance moves in a voluminous grey skirt \u2013 very much in the vein of the great synth duos of the early 80s, like Yazoo.  Her wonderfully deep voice sounds as sure as an arrow, although some of the crowd grumble that she&apos;s essentially just singing over the records. But what records \u2013 songs like Team, Buzzcut Season and of course Royals seem effortlessly fresh and au courant, while a cover of Swingin&apos; Party by Paul Westerberg, inspired by the version by obscure British artist Kindness, doesn&apos;t hurt either. The only danger is that sometimes the show is so minimal that it risks testing the audience&apos;s patience \u2013 yet even if the tunes wore thin, Lorde&apos;s strange twitching and hair-tossing would still mesmerise. As if to underline the fact that this has been a great festival for women musicians, the Jezebels follow Lorde on the Alexandria St stage. Singer Hayley Mary delivers their new, politically engaged material with total confidence, though guitarist Sam Lockwood stares distractedly as though he&apos;s trying to spot a distant relative at a railway station. Another Australian band, Cloud Control, cause an outbreak of crowdsurfing on the Carpark Stage, pulling in one of the biggest crowds of the day. Yet the real treat comes afterwards as Warpaint make their comeback, with Sydneysider Stella Mozgawa on drums. Now on their second album, their sound is even more quicksilver and elusive than it was previously, only underpinned by Mozgawa&apos;s relentlessly funky shuffle. The closing Undertow, with that nagging Nirvana quote, culminates in the whole band massing around the drums and playing faster and faster, a show of virtuosity which never seems self-indulgent, but thrilling. As the bands leave the stage, Four Tet&apos;s bucolic rave is animating the dance stage, while Earl Sweatshirt is bringing some edge to the Zoo stage. Really though, the story of the day has been the day&apos;s women musicians, and how they made Laneway theirs.

Thit kho t\u00e0u, or braised pork, is a classic, hearty family dish that&apos;s often part of a Tet spread; best spooned over rice and with some kind of pickled veggies to offset the richness. Nuoc m\u00e0u (caramel sauce) is available at oriental grocers, but it&apos;s far cheaper to make your own: there&apos;s a recipe on my website: aliettedebodard.com/recipes.aliettedb via GuardianWitness Serves 43 tbsp nuoc m\u00e0u (caramel sauce)400g pork belly, skin on400g pork shoulder2 tbsp nuoc mam (fish sauce), or to taste1 onion, finely chopped3 garlic cloves, finely chopped\u00bd-1 tsp salt1 tsp ground pepper330ml coconut water4 eggsSugar, to tasteRice and pickled vegetables, to serve 1 Cut the pork into small, chopstick-sized chunks. Put a heavy-bottomed pan on a medium heat, and add the caramel sauce (nuoc m\u00e0u). Stir in the pork, and fry for a few minutes until the meat is\u00a0coloured. 2 Add the fish sauce (nuoc mam), onion, garlic, salt, pepper and coconut water; the coconut water should cover the meat by about 1cm so you can top up with more nuoc mam, or plain water, if necessary. 3 Lower the heat, cover, and braise for at least an hour, but the longer the better; 2\u00bd hours if you have time. Meanwhile, hard-boil the eggs, drain, cool and peel, then cut each in half\u00a0lengthways. 4 About 15 minutes before the pork is done, uncover it, stir in the eggs and leave on a low heat for for the remaining cooking time. Season to taste, adding sugar if necessary; the sauce should have thickened a bit, but should still be liquid. Serve over rice with pickled vegetables. Tang yuan (glutinous rice balls) The round shape of these small, sweet dumplings symbolises family togetherness; the stickiness echoing the fact that family should stick together. They are traditionally consumed on the first full moon of the new year; in our family we always like to have them right after the new year\u00a0countdown.TwinnyDip, London, twinnydip.com Makes 24For the filling100g peanuts/sesame seeds, or nut of your choice, toasted and ground50g sugar4 tbsp melted lard/butter For the dumplings225g glutinous rice flour2 tbsp rice flour/tapioca starch100g desiccated coconut/toasted sesame seeds (optional) 1 Mix the filling ingredients together and chill for 30-45 minutes, or put into the freezer for a few minutes. 2 Meanwhile, mix the glutinous rice flour and rice flour or tapioca starch with 150ml luke-warm water to make a soft dough, adding more water if necessary. Divide in half and, on a lightly rice-floured surface, form into cylinders about 4cm thick. Cut each into 12 pieces. 3 Divide the filling into 24 portions. Take a piece of dough and flatten it with your thumb, making an indent in the middle. Place the stuffing into the indent, seal carefully and gently roll into a ball. Repeat. 4 Cook in a pot of boiling water until they float, and look almost translucent. Roll in desiccated coconut or sesame seeds to coat. Soy sauce chicken     TheHomeCook's soy sauce chicken.

Cover and simmer gently for 40 minutes, turning every 15 minutes or so to colour the thighs evenly. Keep an eye on it towards the end of the cooking time as the sticky sauce can catch (though I quite like that, myself). 3 Garnish with the spring onion, and serve with steamed rice and Chinese\u00a0greens.

Photograph: Igglybuff via/GuardianWitness    Traditionally eaten on the first day of the New Year, each ingredient bestowing its own symbolic token to the mix, this is one big pot of health, wealth and happiness. What I love most is the contrast in textures; the smooth slipperiness of the cellophane noodles, the &quot;meaty&quot; chewiness of the shiitake mushrooms, the crunch of the cloud ear fungus, tender spinach, and crisp mange tout.

Trim any tough or hard bits off and cut the shiitake in half, or quarters if very big. Rinse well, and place in a small pan with enough water to cover. 2 Add the wine, ginger, sugar, and a good pinch of salt. Cover, bring to the boil, reduce the heat, and simmer gently for 30 minutes. Drain. 3 Rehydrate the noodles by soaking in boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain, and refresh in cold water. 4 Heat the sunflower oil in a wok. Add the mangetout, carrot and spinach and stir-fry for a minute, then add the tofu, noodles, mushrooms and about 3 tbsp of the mushroom cooking liquid. Cover and simmer for about 4 minutes until the vegetables are crisp but cooked. Drizzle with sesame oil and seeds and serve immediately.  Send us your global grains recipes  Ever heard of teff?

More than one in five parents has received requests from their child&apos;s school for a trip costing that much or more, and many feel pestered into paying for an expedition they can ill-afford \u2013 and often feel is overpriced. Guardian Money spoke to families across Britain about the pressure to send their children on trips which, they claim, are often of dubious educational value. Many felt they were paying four-star prices for stays in youth hostels, and were made to feel like &quot;rubbish parents&quot; if they refused to allow their child to go. We found wealthy families for whom \u00a32,000 school trips to Washington DC were barely a drop in their annual holiday spending budget. But we also found others asked to pay more than their entire family could spend on a holiday in a year, and who felt the cost of trips should be capped. We also found private schools where trips cost \u00a34,500 a head. We polled 1,000 families about the cost of trips. One in five had been asked by their child&apos;s school to pay more than \u00a31,000 for a trip. Seven in 10 said they thought it unacceptable for schools to even ask for such sums \u2013 but 47% said that the pressure and guilt were such that they ended up paying. The poll was carried out for Guardian Money by Hogan&apos;s Irish Cottages, a budget family holiday company. We obtained our case studies by appealing on social media to families that have been asked to pay more than \u00a31,000 for a school trip to get in touch. Interestingly, nearly all the replies came from relatively well-off parts of the UK. This probably suggests that the pricier expeditions reflect the income profile of the area \u2013 with state schools in Surrey and Buckinghamshire organising \u00a31,000-plus trips, but schools in low income areas steering clear of such deals in the knowledge that most parents would not be able to stump up the cash. We asked schools to justify the cost of the trips (see box below), and all of them told us that they offered invaluable, exciting experiences linked to pupils&apos; studies, that staff volunteered their time, and that many schools have hardship funds so no student misses out. Here eight families tell their story, seven with children at state schools and one at a private school. South Africa, biology trip \u00a33,000  &quot;I was gobsmacked when I heard the price of the trip&quot; Louise, from Weybridge, Surrey, works in PR and overseas property, and has a household income in the 40% tax bracket. Her son, aged 14, was invited on a two-week biology trip to South Africa by Heathside School, a local state school. &quot;I was gobsmacked when I heard it was going to cost \u00a33,000. I want to give my children the best possible chance in life and I&apos;ve paid for \u00a3650 school trips in the past, but I think \u00a33,000 is hugely expensive and puts too much pressure on parents. &quot;The first week was going to be spent working with elephants and the second half was deep sea diving. I don&apos;t regret saying no because we made a similar trip as a family last year, which was our trip of a lifetime, not an annual event. &quot;I think there should be a common-sense limit of say \u00a31,000 on school trips or things get out of hand. I don&apos;t believe it is acceptable for a state school to ask parents for such a large sum for a school trip. &quot;Although the children are meant to be fundraising to help, in effect parents underwrite the trip and could still end up paying the whole amount.&quot; Washington and New York, politics and history trip \u00a31,800     Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty    &quot;We spend \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 on holidays each year so it wasn&apos;t an issue&quot;  Rebecca, 50, a GP, has a household income of over \u00a3300,000 and lives in Marlow. Her son, aged 18, was invited by Sir William Borlase&apos;s Grammar School, a selective state-funded academy school in Buckinghamshire, on a week-long politics trip to Washington DC and New York for \u00a31,800. &quot;The trip seemed very worthwhile and we spend \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000 on holidays each year so a \u00a31,800 school trip wasn&apos;t an issue for us at all. We said yes. It&apos;s a grammar school in a very affluent area, and it didn&apos;t surprise me that most \u2013 if not all \u2013 the students on his politics and history course also went. The children did stay in four-star hotels but they flew economy, so it wasn&apos;t a lavish thing. Unfortunately, after their first day in Washington a massive hurricane hit the east coast and instead of going to New York, they sat in the basement of the hotel watching movies. He didn&apos;t enjoy it in the end. Even though I can easily afford to pay more, I wouldn&apos;t be against a \u00a3500 cap on state school trips. I think it would be fairer to other families. And I could just take him wherever he wants to go myself.&quot; New York, orchestra tour \u00a3980 &quot;There was absolutely no way we could afford to pay \u00a3980 for a school trip.&quot; Sarah, 48, an administrator from north London, has a household income of \u00a347,000. Her daughter, aged 17, was invited by her state school to go on a four-day orchestra tour to New York. The price was \u00a3980, plus lunches. &quot;There is an assumption of wealth if you live in north London, even by schools, but there was absolutely no way we could afford to pay \u00a3980 for a school trip. That made me feel like a rubbish parent. The school made the trip sound so exciting, and it annoyed and surprised me that a state school would dangle a carrot like that in front of my daughter. I think it was divisive and she would have got the same experience touring five music venues in the UK. She didn&apos;t need to go to New York. I&apos;m holding my breath because I think the question is going to come up again for my son, who is 15 and at the same school. I&apos;m dreading him coming home and asking to go. I think state schools should limit trips to \u00a3500 and allow you to pay over a year.&quot; Zambia, charity and safari \u00a31,700     Photograph: Alamy    &quot;My daughter paid \u00a31,400 towards the trip all by herself&quot; Philippa is a shopkeeper, from Esher, Surrey. At the age of 15, her daughter was invited by Esher Church of England High School, a state school, to spend two weeks working at charity schools in Zambia for \u00a31,700. &quot;The school has asked her on \u00a3900 ski trips in the past and we&apos;ve always said no. But this trip was different. It seemed like a wonderful opportunity. At \u00a31,700 it was an expensive trip, but I also thought it was a fair price. We agreed to it, but told her she&apos;d have to raise half the money herself, and not through sponsorship \u2013 by babysitting, cat-sitting, hosting supper parties and working at my shop. At the end of the trip she was going on a three-day safari and staying in a hotel with a pool, so it wasn&apos;t just working at the charity schools. The school set up a fundraising group, and all the parents helped by holding quiz nights, car boot sales etc. We collectively raised enough to contribute \u00a3300 per student. I&apos;m proud to say she paid the remaining balance of \u00a31,400 all by herself. She spent the first week in the capital, Lusaka, teaching dance and tag rugby to the local children, organising sports tournaments and painting the school walls. And although she enjoyed the safari at the end, she felt that first week was life-changing. It opened her eyes about the world. I think working to pay for the trip also boosted her confidence and she made new friends at school. It was absolutely worth every penny.&quot; Austria, skiing \u00a31,000 &quot;If she&apos;d wanted to go, I would have had to borrow the money&quot; Olivia, 35, runs a training company in Bristol and has a household income of \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000. Her daughter, 11, was invited by her state school to go on a five-day \u00a3895 ski trip in Europe. &quot;My first thought was: &apos;bloody hell, I could take the entire family on holiday for that.&apos; In my view, skiing is not a useful life skill and the trip was going to be a lot less educational than, say, visiting a capital city. If she&apos;d been absolutely gutted when I said no, I would have felt guilty. And I wouldn&apos;t have wanted her to feel left out if all her friends were going. I would have had to borrow the money and it would have cost us more than \u00a31,000 including her kit. Fortunately, she wasn&apos;t desperately upset. In total, the school has asked us for more than \u00a31,350 in school trips this year. I think it&apos;s ridiculous. I can&apos;t ask my daughter to contribute \u2013 she&apos;s only 11. What am I supposed to say: &apos;Give me your pocket money for the next five years? Cut the grass every day?&apos; It puts a lot of pressure on parents.&quot; Australia, hockey and netball tour \u00a34,500     Photograph: Alamy    &quot;I prefer to spend my money on a holiday with with my kids, not sending them away&quot; Viv, 47, works for a PR company in Fetcham, Surrey. Her daughter 16, was invited by her private school, Epsom College, to go on a \u00a34,500 hockey and netball tour of Australia. &quot;An email came round saying there was an opportunity for her to do three trips, each over \u00a33,000. My ex-husband, who is wealthy and lives in the Philippines, said he would pay for the hockey trip in full if she wanted to go. In the end, not enough parents signed up. I think it was because it wasn&apos;t seen as good value. Despite the price, the kids would mostly have been staying with families at the schools they were visiting. The teachers, however, would have been staying in hotels. So instead of that trip, they&apos;re going on a \u00a31,500 hockey-only tour of Europe, in a coach. Personally, I wouldn&apos;t have paid for either trip. But I don&apos;t have much money. The money I do have, I prefer to spend on a holiday with my kids, not sending them away. On the other hand, their father has\u00a0plenty of spare money and sees these trips differently. He thinks they live in a very global world and it gives them a\u00a0better perspective. He didn&apos;t hesitate.&quot; Austria, skiing \u00a31,500  &quot;Skiing is an expensive hobby and I accept that&quot; Sharon, 43, owns a design and marketing company in Thelwall, and has a household income of \u00a3100,000. Her 14-year-old daughter was invited on a \u00a31,000 week-long ski trip to Austria while she was attending Lymm High School, a state school in Cheshire. The price was \u00a31,000. &quot;We said yes, but we felt the trip was expensive for what she was getting. She was travelling by coach and staying in youth hostels. At \u00a31,500 (including her meals, kit and spending money), it wasn&apos;t great value. But skiing is an expensive hobby and I accept that. I think it&apos;s a good thing she gets the opportunity to do it on a school trip. It makes her more independent. Plus I don&apos;t enjoy skiing, so it&apos;s not a holiday I&apos;d want to take her on myself. We used it as a bargaining tool with her for good behaviour and paid in instalments over four months. She had a great time and made friends with people she wouldn&apos;t normally socialise with. I think it was worth it.&quot; Singapore/Malaysia, sports tour \u00a32,050     Photograph: Alamy    &quot;Anyone can manage to raise \u00a32,000 if they put their minds to it.&quot; Pamela, 44, works in local government in Uttlesford, Essex, and has a household income of \u00a390,000. Her son, 14, has been invited by his state school to go on a \u00a32,050 12-night sports tournaments trip to Singapore and Malaysia in August 2014. &quot;We have seven kids so although our household income is high, it has to go far. We&apos;ve been saving for this trip ever since they told us about it two years ago. We think it is a fantastic opportunity for our son to see that part of the world, and\u00a0we could never afford to go as a family. He has a paper round so has been contributing \u00a330 a month towards the trip for 18 months. He&apos;s also training for the tournaments after school. He loves his sport and is very good at it. I wouldn&apos;t have been able to say no \u2013 I would have gone to great lengths to make sure he could go. I think with two years to pay for it, anyone could manage to raise \u00a32,000 if they put their minds to it.&quot; Thanks to Hogan&apos;s Irish Cottages, Mumsnet and MoneySavingExpert.com for help with this story. Some names have been changed. What the schools say We asked all the schools named in these case studies to respond. In summary, they said:  \u2022 The trips offer students invaluable, exciting experiences linked to their studies outside the classroom. \u2022 Staff volunteer their time to keep costs down and trips are not compulsory nor part of the curriculum. \u2022 Not all trips could realistically be taken by parents and the point of some trips is that students are exposed to situations without their parents along. \u2022 Many school trips cost less than \u00a31,000. \u2022 All the schools named help parents to fund or fundraise for the trips, and encourage students to self-fund where possible, as a valuable life lesson. Many have hardship funds, so that no student misses out due to financial need. For example, Tarun Kapur, CBE, executive principal of Lymm High School said: &quot;At Lymm High School we are proud to say that we offer trips for all abilities and pockets, including subsidised trips for those in most need.&quot; Mrs A\u00a0L\u00a0Cullum, principal at Heathside School said: &quot;The school operates a hardship fund to support students on trips linked to the curriculum; this expedition is not part of the curriculum nor takes place in term time and parents are not expected to cover the cost \u2013 rather students are expected to meet the cost through organising fundraising activities.&quot; Simon Morris, Headteacher at Esher Church of England School said: &quot;We are incredibly proud as a school to be able to offer a wide range of experiences through trips to our students, and this particular trip is part of a six-year school community project helping children from poorer communities to access education. This is the only trip of around 70 annual trips in the school that has a cost above \u00a31,000&quot;.  Dr Peter Holding at Sir William Borlase&apos;s Grammar School said: &quot;Our goal is that no child should miss out on an opportunity owing to lack of finance and we try to help parents find funding for such trips, which we think provide our students with invaluable experiences linked to their studies.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/arctic-city-new-route-china", "sentences": ["Eleven countries, including Poland and Singapore, have appointed Arctic ambassadors to promote their national interests."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-01T12:24:17Z", "title": "Russian Arctic city hopes to cash in as melting ice opens new sea route to China", "tags": ["Arctic", "Polar regions", "Environment", "Climate change", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "The city of Nadym, in the extreme north of Siberia, is one of the Earth&apos;s least hospitable places, shrouded in darkness for half of the year, with temperatures plunging below -30C and the nearby Kara Sea semi-permanently frozen. But things are looking up for this Arctic conurbation halfway between Europe and China. Over the next 30 years climate change is likely to open up a polar shipping route between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, cutting travel time to Asia by 40% and allowing Russia&apos;s vast oil and gas resources to be exported to China, Japan and south Asia much faster. Nadym stands to benefit from a warmer climate more than any other Arctic city \u2013 the Russian government plans to connect it by road and rail to other oil and gas centres; Gazprom, the world&apos;s largest gas company, is building a port nearby with French oil major Total; and if the new northern sea route is open for even six months of the year, Nadym will find itself on the 21st-century equivalent of the ancient silk route. &quot;The entire centre of gravity of the world economy is shifting to Nadym,&quot; said the mayor, Stanislav Shegurov, a former gas worker, at a recent meeting of Arctic leaders in Norway. Expectations are high that the route will complement the Suez canal as a key waterway for trade to and from Asia. &quot;The Arctic is our home and our future. We will make full use of the northern sea route. We are building infrastructure, we are making history. We have ambitious plans,&quot; said Anton Vasiliev, Russian ambassador for the Arctic. Only 71 large ships, working mostly with Russian icebreakers, navigated the route in 2013, but Russia expects a 30-fold increase in shipping by 2020 and ice-free water over most of its length by 2050. The summer ice has declined by nearly 50% in 40 years and by 2050, say Laurence Smith and Scott Stephenson of the University of California, ordinary vessels should be able to travel easily along the northern sea route and ice-strengthened ships should be able to pass over the pole itself. Confidence that the Arctic will become economically important is seen in the rush of countries and companies to claim a stake. Eleven countries, including Poland and Singapore, have appointed Arctic ambassadors to promote their national interests. Gazprom last week launched in South Korea the first of four giant &quot;ice-class&quot; natural gas carriers for the sea route. The Russian government plans to spend more than $3bn reopening a military base on the Novosibirsk Islands and is building new icebreakers and navigational centres. Oil giant Rosneft and ExxonMobile will start drilling for oil in the Kara Sea this year. Norway and the other Nordic countries have all made Arctic development a priority. &quot;The Arctic is changing rapidly. It will be our most important foreign policy area. Climate change is putting Norway under pressure,&quot; said its prime minister, Erna Solberg. Finland, which has no access to the northern sea route, has proposed a railway linking its mines to the Russian coast. &quot;Finland needs a new Nokia. The Arctic could be it,&quot; said its Arctic affairs ambassador, Hannu Halinen. American, Canadian, Japanese, South Korean and British companies all intend to use the sea route to mine across the region, but no country hopes to gain more than China, according to Wang Chuanxing, polar researcher at Tongji University, Shanghai. &quot;China&apos;s economy is 50% dependent on trade. The development of the northern sea route would have a major impact on its economy. One-third of China&apos;s trade is with the EU and the US. The opening of the northern sea route is vital for China,&quot; he said. Japan also hopes to benefit. &quot;Ten per cent of the world&apos;s unexploited crude oil and 20% of its natural gas is said to be in the Arctic. Recent changes because of climate change are attracting people in Japan. We want to actively participate. We are researching the Arctic sea route,&quot; said Toshio Kunikata, the Japanese ambassador in charge of Arctic affairs. &quot;A great chess game is being played with countries staking claims to the Arctic to make sure they are not left out. Climate change is taking place at twice the global average speed in the Arctic. Some countries, like China, are looking 50 years ahead,&quot; said Malte Humpert, director of the Washington-based thinktank the Arctic Institute. &quot;The polar research institute of China said that Arctic shipping would play a major role in the country&apos;s future trade, and suggested that, by the year 2020, 5%-15% of China&apos;s trade value \u2013 about $500bn \u2013 could pass through the Arctic. But that may be too hasty. We think the route will mostly benefit China&apos;s trade with Europe, but this is not likely to be because its priority is to build closer ties with Latin America and Africa. &quot;We think future shipping in the polar region will mostly consist of seasonal activity and transporting the region&apos;s natural resources to markets in east Asia. Climate change will transform the frozen north into a seasonally navigable ocean, but Arctic shipping routes will not become a new silk road for China.&quot; says Humpert. Norwegian shippers are cautious, too. &quot;Sailing trans-arctic from Yokohama to Hamburg would shave 40% off the distance compared to the Suez Canal. Yet our own predictions have been modest. In 2013 there were 71 commercial transits through the polar sea, compared with 18,000 and 14,000 through the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal,&quot; said Sturla Henriksen, head of the Norwegian Shipowners&apos; Association. &quot;In 30 years, more than two-thirds of the volume of Arctic summer ice has disappeared.

Free-market organisation Civitas castigates government ministers for allowing wealthy foreign investors to stoke a property boom that it says is driving up prices and locking millions of UK citizens out of the housing market. The plans would prevent the likes of Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, or other Russian oligarchs from adding to their multimillion-pound UK portfolios. They also aim to stem a flood of investment from countries such as China, Malaysia and Singapore. Concerned that many middle and lower earners are being forced to pay high rents in London because they can&apos;t afford to buy, Civitas calls on ministers to adopt a scheme similar to one operating in Australia, which ensures that no sale can take place to overseas buyers unless they can show that their investment will add to existing housing stock. Such a system would mean that no existing home could be sold to a buyer from outside the EU, and that such buyers could acquire newbuild homes only if their investment led to one or more additional properties being built. The report, called Finding Shelter, cites statistics showing that 85% of prime London property purchases in 2012 were made with overseas money. Estate agent Savills found that last year \u00a37bn of international money was spent on &quot;high-end&quot; London homes, with just 20% of that spent by UK citizens. Two-thirds of homes bought by people from overseas were not purchased for owner-occupation but as investments. Civitas says the problem is not confined to the top end of the market and that overseas buyers are also acquiring less expensive newbuild homes. It says that over the past two years only 27% of new homes in central London went to UK buyers, while more than half were sold to residents of Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Russia. &quot;The UK property market is being used as an investment vehicle by the global super-rich \u2013 and increasingly the simply well-to-do,&quot; the report says. &quot;The inflationary impact of this extra cash is good news for property owners \u2013 until they want to trade up the housing ladder. &quot;It is good news for estate agents on commission, who report with glee every pulse and surge in the market. But it is not good for those already being priced out at the bottom.&quot; Overseas investment, it adds, is also &quot;distorting housebuilding priorities, with developers disproportionately attracted to high-value developments while ignoring the undersupply at lower levels of the market.&quot; Oligarchs including Abramovich and former Yukos Oil vice-president Konstantin Kagalovsky have bought London properties, with Belgravia, Knightsbridge, Kensington and Chelsea their favourite hunting grounds. Under Australia&apos;s scheme, all foreign non-residents and holders of short-term visas have to apply to the Foreign Investment Review Board if they want to buy property. Its rules state that they can do so only if their investment leads to an increase in available dwellings. Civitas says that if a similar scheme were adopted here, people from outside the EU would be able buy a newbuild property only if they had invested in a building scheme. In last year&apos;s autumn statement the chancellor, George Osborne, announced that he was closing a loophole that had allowed foreign investors to make huge profits on sales of UK homes by avoiding any capital gains tax. Civitas says that move, while a step forward, is unlikely to deter them, because the booming British market remains so attractive. Labour recently announced a series of measures to boost housebuilding and deter foreign investment in London, including changing the rules so that newbuild homes have to be marketed to Londoners first, rather than sold off-plan to investors around the world. It also plans to double council tax for homes left empty and will end another loophole that allows overseas owners to cut their tax bills by claiming their properties are &quot;second homes&quot; and furnishing them with minimal items such a single table and chair. Sadiq Khan, the shadow London minister, said: &quot;London is in the middle of a severe housing crisis, yet there are around 50,000 empty homes across the city. It&apos;s complete madness. We must stop housing that&apos;s built as family homes being used instead as a piggy bank for the world&apos;s wealthiest people. &quot;We urgently need to build more affordable housing in London, but unless all new homes are made available for Londoners to buy, they won&apos;t help solve the crisis.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/02/tories-taxing-poor-ignoring-billionaires-row-scandal-labour", "sentences": ["More than half were sold to buyers from Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Russia."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-02T15:24:00Z", "title": "Tories are taxing poor while ignoring 'Billionaires Row' scandal, says Labour", "tags": ["Tax", "Conservatives", "Property", "Council tax", "London", "Real estate", "Money", "Labour", "Bedroom tax", "UK news", "Housing", "Society", "Housing market", "Politics", "Communities", "Boris Johnson"], "article": "     Labour has accused the Conservatives of being obsessed by taxing the poor for unoccupied bedrooms while refusing to act against the super-rich who keep mansions empty for years. The allegations follow the Guardian&apos;s revelation at the weekend that a third of houses on the most expensive stretch of &quot;Billionaires Row&quot; in Hampstead, north London, are standing vacant. The London mayor, Boris Johnson, called on more town halls to levy a punitive 50% extra council tax on owners of empty homes. But Labour immediately hit back saying it was not enough to end the &quot;scandal&quot;. At least \u00a3350m worth of property is sitting unused in The Bishops Avenue, the so-called Billionaires Row. The vacant and often ruined properties include 10 mansions previously owned on behalf of the Saudi royal family that have not been lived in for up to 25 years. The situation prompted local anger at the weekend. Phoenix Rainbow, a housing activist and community organiser in the London borough of Barnet, which includes the avenue, said it showed &quot;gross mismanagement of the space we have in this country&quot;. Johnson said: &quot;With unprecedented demand for housing it makes little sense for property which could easily be rented to be left empty for years on end. I would welcome more boroughs charging 150% extra council tax to owners of property that has been empty for over two years. These taxes should deliver a strong incentive to encourage owners to rent out or live in long-standing unoccupied homes.&quot; Clive Betts MP, chair of the Commons communities and local government select committee, said the situation in the avenue was &quot;an astounding and stark example of the empty homes problem&quot;. He called for councils to be given powers to treble rates on empty homes after a certain period. A 50% empty homes premium on properties standing empty for two years has been available to councils since last April. But some authorities have complained that it has had no effect on multi-millionaire owners. On Bishops Avenue the fine would come to just \u00a31,416.20 a year.

(Graeme Robertson)    Betts said: &quot;People can claim to do what they want with the property they own, but how must those living in cramped and poor accommodation feel when they see some of the most palatial, beautiful, properties with incredible amounts of space going to waste? &quot;This is a government obsessed by under-occupation of two-bed council houses in London occupied by people with nowhere else to go. But in the same city you have mansions unoccupied with no action being taken.&quot; Labour&apos;s policy is a 100% council tax levy on empty homes; it estimates there are 50,000 empty homes in London. The shadow housing minister, Emma Reynolds, said: &quot;With the country in the midst of the biggest housing crisis in a generation, at its worst in London, it is a scandal that overseas investors are buying London homes as piggybanks with no intention of living in them. &quot;Labour would crack down on empty home loopholes and give councils proper powers to tackle buy-to-leave where overseas investors buy up properties and then leave them empty.&quot; Asked to comment on The Bishops Avenue revelations the communities minister, Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams, said the coalition had supported councils to &quot;tackle the blight of empty homes&quot;. He said government policies included &quot;reforms on council tax flexibilities and the new empty homes premium,[which] allows councils to remove the special tax subsidies being given to empty homes&quot;. The free-market thinktank Civitas is increasing pressure on the government by proposing a ban on buyers outside the EU acquiring existing homes; it would let them buy new property only if it led to more properties being built. Civitas cites statistics showing that 85% of prime London property purchases in 2012 were completed with overseas money and says overseas investment distorts house-building priorities. In central London only 27% of new homes went to UK buyers, according to the estate agency Knight Frank. More than half were sold to buyers from Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Malaysia and Russia. Councils have powers under empty dwelling management orders to take over the running of empty homes and collect rent or force their sale, but these powers are not routinely used. Conservative-controlled Barnet council, which oversees The Bishops Avenue, cited the legal costs of taking on and challenging absent owners. Barnet council&apos;s leader, Richard Cornelius, said: &quot;The Bishops Avenue is in its own little bubble and frankly has little connection with the rest of Barnet. I would rather spend public money bringing family houses back into use than get involved in battles with the lawyers of billionaires.&quot; David Ireland, chief executive of the Homes from Empty Homes campaign, said the council&apos;s failure to bring the vacant mansions back into use sent out a bad message nationally. He said: &quot;There are countless people in inadequate housing and here are homes on The Bishops Avenue that could be used. I call on the local authority to use empty property management orders or enforced sale of these properties. If they showed they were willing to do that it would force other owners to take action.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/03/durian-worlds-smelliest-fruit-sale-britain", "sentences": ["The green, spiky durian is an awkward travel companion: it is banned on Singapore&apos;s rail network, as well as many in airports and hotels in south-east Asia."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-03T15:45:00Z", "title": "Durian, the world's smelliest fruit, goes on sale in Britain", "tags": ["Fruit", "Malaysian food and drink", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Nose pegs at the ready \u2026 musang king durians are now on sale in the UK. The infamous durian \u2013 regarded the king of fruit in much of south-east Asia \u2013 is best known for its pungent smell, variously compared to sewage, rotting flesh or, at best, ripe cheese. The green, spiky durian is an awkward travel companion: it is banned on Singapore&apos;s rail network, as well as many in airports and hotels in south-east Asia. Durians polarise people. Fans say if you can get past the stink, the flesh has an ambrosial taste. &quot;Aficionados will travel terrible distances \u2026 do anything \u2026 to scarf down globs of custardy flesh from a durian,&quot; writes Thomas Fuller of the New York Times in a recent ode to the fruit. While durians have long been available in Chinese supermarkets around Britain, this is the first time the prized Malaysian variety has been on sale in the UK, although thus far it is restricted to Loon Fung stores in London. Musang kings are left to ripen naturally on the tree; the growers spread large nets underneath and wait for them to fall. They are collected and vacuum-packed on the same day to preserve their ripeness. The fruits don&apos;t smell while still in their packaging, promises a spokesperson for Malaysia Kitchen, which promotes Malaysian food in the UK. Once you open the packaging, however, you&apos;re on your own. Do it in the garden, or at least with all the windows flung open.     Durians are banned on some planes, trains and in hotels. Photograph: Alamy    Masterchef winner and chef Tim Anderson is coming round to durians. &quot;I first tried durian in Thailand. The smell is so strange: onions and meat, if I&apos;m being charitable. Some people say it smells like dead rats.&quot; Anderson persevered with the durian, however, and is now working with Malaysia Kitchen to create recipes. He has used it in a silky gelato with coconut and ripe banana, which, he says, are the closest foods to durians in texture and taste: &quot;The durian&apos;s flavour isn&apos;t far off an overripe banana.&quot; Many people find it hard not only to get past the durian&apos;s stench, but also to reconcile this smell with the sweetish, &quot;custardy&quot; flesh inside. &quot;The smell is savoury but the flavour is sweet,&quot; says Anderson, who has also tried durian in a risotto instead of cheese, served with ox-cheek rendang.     Peeled durians. Photograph: Minowa Studio Co/Getty Images/StockFood    Of course, its notoriety could be the very thing that makes the durian a success in the UK. &quot;I know loads of people put off by the smell of kimchi, but that&apos;s getting really popular,&quot; says Anderson. Will musang kings become a similar cult hit \u2013 a must-try for curious food lovers, or a macho feat for those that seek out the world&apos;s hottest chillies and biggest burgers? The durian is surely on any tick-list of the world&apos;s stinkiest foods, along with French vieux-boulogne cheese and Swedish surstr\u00f6mming, the fermented herring that made even Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall balk on his current TV show, Scandimania. Blogs and online articles explain &quot;How I learned to love durian&quot;, for those who want to push past the stench. Others will ask: why bother? Anderson thinks durians will remain a niche food: &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll see them on the menu at a Jamie Oliver restaurant soon.&quot; Perhaps something will be lost in translation: a ripe durian scoffed on a Malaysian beach is surely a more exciting proposition than eating one in a Middlesex semi. Either way, Boris Johnson may wish to draw up the wording for a durian tube ban, just in case they become this year&apos;s burger. Love them or hate them, no one wants to smell durians in a packed train carriage."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2014/feb/04/pericles-lewis-yale-nus-research-humanities", "sentences": ["Pericles Lewis is president of Yale-NUS College in Singapore \u2013 a collegiate liberal arts college set up by Yale University and the National University of Singapore.", "Largely funded by the Singaporean government, it opened its doors in July 2013 to its first cohort of 150 high-achieving undergraduate students, recruited from some 25 different countries \u2013 including Wales."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-04T07:00:00Z", "title": "Pericles Lewis: a humanities education produces truly creative leaders", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Research", "Academics", "Student engagement", "Student experience", "Fundraising", "Funding", "Fees", "Higher education", "Education", "University teaching", "Lecturers"], "article": "Pericles Lewis is president of Yale-NUS College in Singapore \u2013 a collegiate liberal arts college set up by Yale University and the National University of Singapore.

Lewis taught English and comparative literature at Yale University for 14 years and designed the humanities curriculum at Yale-NUS. He tells me why canny employers see the value of humanities graduates. As someone who has dedicated their academic career to the humanities, do you think it&apos;s a subject that still struggles to gain respect, recognition and funding?  I do notice a lot of people writing about the crisis of the humanities or the decline of the study of the humanities, but they are still overall quite strong. Humanities degrees haven&apos;t actually declined in numbers, it&apos;s just the proportion of degrees granted is somewhat smaller. By studying the humanities, you don&apos;t neccessarly learn the job skills that you are going to need right away \u2013 what you learn is the ability to think creatively, to write and communicate well. There are a lot of very distinguished leaders in business, government and non-profit organisations who credit their training \u2013 whether it&apos;s in philosophy, history, literature or art history \u2013 as part of why they have been so successful. American policy leaders often look at Asia and say, oh gosh, they are producing so many engineers, how are we going to keep up?  It is certainly important to strengthen science and technology education in the US, but on the other hand, the US has a very innovative and dynamic financial culture. If you think about silicon valley or the entertainment industry, people who have a creative kind of background contribute in an important way to the US economy.  Many Asian leaders turn to the US and see that there is something about the US education system that is promoting some of this flexibility in creativity, and inject some that into their educational systems too. Do you believe that humanities research makes an impact on society? And do you think &quot;impact factor&quot; is a good way to measure quality of research? I am a little sceptical of quantitative judgments based on how many times your article is cited. In some fields, all the citations will happen in the first couple of the years. In others, it may take a while for people to recognise the importance of a piece of research.  Qualitative assessment is much more important \u2013 the best university departments use peer review and the view of scholars in the field rather than sheer numbers to assess quality. As for impact on society, it&apos;s very desirable that good scholarship should have an impact on society, but not all scholarship has a direct impact. To take an example from the sciences, there is important scientific research that is going to cure a disease in the immediate future, but a lot of scientific discoveries are made because of basic research and principles that aren&apos;t directly related to a cure that might 30 or 50 years down the line. In the humanities, you can&apos;t go on the basis of how many people read your book or how many people attend your lecture, the quality of the work is something that is not measurable in simple impact terms. What can the UK learn from the US in how it assesses the value of research in the humanities? Close qualiatative analysis of work is important, as is using the system of blind peer review so that research grants are based on quality than political connections.  I don&apos;t know that much about the British system, but I do know some British academics feel the way UK research is assessed is too numbers-driven. That can have a negative effect, because you feel you have to get your book or article done by a certain deadline. That may lead to more short-term projects, or to rushing things. The blind peer review system is, of course, not foolproof \u2013 if you are in the field you may be able to guess whose article you are reviewing.  It is notable that a lot of top scholars from around the world have moved to the US, including me. Not to say that I&apos;m a top scholar. But I am Canadian and I moved to the US because of the quality of its tertiary education and research systems. &quot;To grow investment for the humanities, we must start with a clear sense of narrative backed up by solid data,&quot; says Earl Lewis, president of the Andrew W Mellon foundation. What story, for the humanities, do you think we should be telling? The humanities address questions about what it means to be human: how should I live my life? What is justice? How did we become who we are? What makes a person human? Those are essential and eternal questions and the best research illuminates them. I don&apos;t think there will be a time when people don&apos;t value that. It is true that people now and in the past tend to say, well what is its utilitarian value and how is it going to improve my salary? But ultimately, the humanities are about human value and human work, so the best scholarship addresses that, and I think we will continue to have an audience.  In my experience, when you speak to potential donors and foundations about trying to educate students about these matters, they want to support it because they also recognise its value.

However, a new era is ahead where creative teams step outside their firm&apos;s activities and focus on where they can contribute to fixing broken systems through new business opportunities. Moreover, many of these endeavours are part of the net positive movement, an attempt to restore some of what&apos;s been lost \u2013 such as forests, flowing rivers, a stable climate and clean air. Targeted innovation is where companies aim new kinds of commercial propositions at the big social and environmental hotspots in society. They build on their own competencies and creatively intervene within their sector or adjacent sectors to tackle the local and global challenges. If we take our current system of mobility we can see the pollution and congestion that go with it reaching critical levels in many parts of the globe and yet much of the automotive sector remains stuck in designing more fuel-efficient vehicles. But, some are engaged in more of a step change. BMW and Nissan are responding to the need for smarter mobility, the changing aspirations among customers, and rise of Zipcar. They are intervening in new ways: getting serious about both electric vehicles and new kinds of mobility services in a few key markets that promote collaborative short-term car use. Smaller and lesser known enterprises, such as Zoom and iCarsClub, also see the benefits of targeted innovation and are taking car sharing services to parts of Asia where smog and crowded roads are becoming unmanageable. Zoom provides hourly rentals in Bangalore (Bengaluru) and iCarsClub offers a peer-to-peer service in Singapore. These enterprises bring experiences gained in the west and present the benefits of car sharing over car ownership to customers. Our power system is also in urgent need of fixing. Interestingly, fixes are emerging from an adjacent sector: retail. Ikea and Kingfisher offer micro-renewables and energy services as part of their net positive commitments. Ian Cheshire, the CEO of Kingfisher, has been vocal on the opportunities for pinching customers from utilities and capitalising on the distrust and lack of innovation in the power sector. What if others enter the fray? Positive and lucrative interventions from retailers and other sectors could start to transform the way we produce and consume energy. Philips has capitalised on the urgent need to address other systemic challenges \u2013 healthcare, lighting and pollution \u2013 in key regions. It recently diverted sales of air purification devices to where they were needed most within various parts of Asia. As a result of tackling such challenges, the company has substantially improved its balance sheet. These events prompt questions around where else shifts are starting to take place that provide new opportunities. A milestone was passed recently, with half a million buildings in the UK now installed with solar panels. How might home insurers provide support in this space? Another example is new developments in manufacturing . The &quot;maker movement&quot; is a response to the increasing appetite for people to train up on making things using welding equipment or 3D printers, and &quot;collaborative production&quot; brings customers and designers together in physical or virtual spaces to co-produce goods. Nike, Puma, Adidas and Converse are among the few in the clothing industry who involve customers in the design process, and some of them go further to build in sustainability options. The food system is witnessing some of the big catering companies exploring greener and healthier diets. Sodexo is part of the Meatless Monday campaign and Bon Appetit Caterers provide meals with less meat and more vegetable content. The next tranche of questions follows: how can retailers, insurers, ICT companies and all kinds of service providers capitalise on and accelerate moves towards smart mobility, smart energy, smart buildings, smart manufacturing and smart food? The answers will lead to more targeted and successful innovations for outward looking businesses.

PwC&apos;s Escape index \u2013 which looks at a range of economic, political, social, technological and environmental indicators of success \u2013 placed the UK 19th, down seven places on its pre-financial crisis position. Britain&apos;s fall down a league table headed by Sweden, Switzerland and Singapore was matched only by the declines suffered by the countries worst hit by the eurozone sovereign debt meltdown: Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC and co-author of the report, said: &quot;The UK continues to score well as an easy place to do business and recent sharp falls in unemployment show the flexibility of its labour market. But the UK was hit hard by the global financial crisis: since then it has had relatively low GDP per capita growth and high inflation, although both measures improved significantly during 2013.&quot; As Europe&apos;s financial centre, the UK was particularly hard hit by the near-collapse of the global banking system in the winter of 2008-09, with national output falling by more than 7% and then recovering only slowly thereafter. It scored badly on many of the economic indicators assessed by PwC, such as living standards, the cost of living and the government&apos;s budget deficit. The sharp decline followed a period between 2000 and 2007 when Britain held its place in the global pecking order despite the strong advances enjoyed by parts of the emerging world. Hawksworth said the UK was now likely to start moving back up the table after better economic news in 2014. &quot;UK businesses and consumers are likely to feel the benefit of the current recovery because the brakes went on so hard between 2007 and 2012. Now we&apos;re seeing renewed job creation and growth, the UK is likely to be moving back up the index. &quot;Despite the recent cyclical upturn, our analysis shows that the UK has had some persistent structural weaknesses throughout the period since 2000. We find that the UK lags behind the average of its advanced economy peers in terms of investment, education, trade, income inequality and also general levels of trust in the population.&quot; PwC said its aim was to produce a holistic measure of how countries were performing over time, based on five yardsticks of success: economic growth and stability; social progress and cohesion; communications technology; political, legal and regulatory institutions; and environmental sustainability. Northern European countries dominated the PwC top 10, with China rising five places to 16th, above the US at 18th and France at 20th. None of the four MINT countries \u2013 Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey \u2013 identified by the economist Jim O&apos;Neill, made it into the top 30. Hawksworth added: &quot;To graduate to the advanced economy club, it is not enough just to do well on traditional economic indicators such as GDP growth and inflation. Governments and business investors should pay attention to the broader range of measures that our Escape index captures.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/05/virgin-atlantic-australia-drops-flight-direct", "sentences": ["Craig Kreeger, Virgin Atlantic chief executive, said: &quot;Despite the best efforts of our employees, external factors such as increasing costs and a weakening Australian dollar have affected our profitability.&quot; &quot;These are still difficult times for the airline industry and as part of our strategy to operate more efficiently we need to deploy our aircraft to routes with the right level of demand to be financially viable.&quot; Virgin Australia, in which Branson retains a minor stake, is a separate company and continues to operate as a domestic rival to Qantas in Australia, with codeshare agreements with Etihad and Singapore airlines for international flights."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-05T18:15:57Z", "title": "Virgin Atlantic drops flights to Australia", "tags": ["Virgin Atlantic", "Airline industry", "Virgin Group", "Sydney", "Business", "UK news", "Australia news", "Transport", "World news"], "article": "Virgin Atlantic is to stop flying to Australia, having decided its Sydney route is no longer economically viable.

But then came the suit-and-tie responsibilities of government, and the sentiments of opposition crashed into the realities of managing an economy and reducing a budget deficit, and it turned out that continuing to \u201cmake things\u201d like cars, or tinned tomatoes and peaches, was going to be expensive, and the Coalition decided on a very different path to economic sophistication. If you set aside that very large discrepancy between pre-and post election, it\u2019s entirely defensible for the Abbott government to draw a new \u201cline in the sand\u201d on corporate handouts, especially as it re-examines government payments to families.  The problems are, we still don\u2019t actually know where the line has been drawn, and the government is refusing to accept responsibility for the fact that this kind of line-drawing has consequences, not just for businesses, but for people \u2013 the kind of blue-collar working people they were appealing to before the poll. The \u201cline\u201d came with the government\u2019s refusal to grant $25m to SPC Ardmona to retool its loss-making Shepparton factory. SPC\u2019s request was not especially large or unjustifiable as these things go \u2013 the company just had the misfortune that its request landed on the cabinet table right at the time the government needed to make the point. And the government could have said exactly that \u2013 this was the kind of request that might have been considered in the past, but could no longer be afforded, and that if the refusal meant the plant had to shut, it stood ready to help the workers retrain and the region find other employers. But it didn\u2019t. It painted SPC as a poorly managed business brought down because it had agreed to overgenerous perks and conditions for its workers. Sure, SPC\u2019s enterprise agreement has some provisions most employers would think should not be there, but as the company eventually clarified in an unusually blunt statement, some of the conditions being cited by the government were either no longer there, or were no longer paid, or were the result of trade-offs with the workers. And in any event, the total cost of the conditions was tiny compared with the cost to the company of the high dollar and cheap foreign imports, \u201cpiffling\u201d in the words of the increasingly outspoken local Coalition member Sharman Stone. (That central point turned out to be far less newsworthy than whether she had called the prime minister a liar.) The government also presented SPC\u2019s parent company, Coca-Cola Amatil as a greedy, mega-profitable business with \u201ca stronger balance sheet than the commonwealth\u201d, trying to shift to taxpayers costs it could easily afford itself. Yes, as the prime minister has repeatedly told us, Coca-Cola Amatil makes a hefty profit, but for years SPC has been making big losses. What any company, greedy or otherwise, does in that situation is close the factory \u2013 which is exactly what the CCA board has been contemplating for some time. But SPC happens to be the biggest employer in a region that already suffers very high unemployment, a situation which, in the past, might have prompted governments to offer some assistance to retool the plant and allow it to stay open. And it is also unclear exactly where the \u201cline\u201d has been drawn. Joe Hockey, the driving force for the government\u2019s new economic philosophy, has come closest to a definition. He told the Australian Financial Review on Thursday that Qantas, for example, could still qualify for some kind of government assistance for two reasons \u2013 it was constrained from operating freely by government-imposed law (the Qantas Sales Act) and it was not operating on a level playing field because its major competitor, Virgin, was backed by three state-owned airlines, Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Etihad. The first is a clear point of difference between SPC and Qantas. But SPC has a good case to argue that its playing field is also pretty skewed by unfairly cheap foreign imports \u2013 it only needs to point to the finding by the anti-dumping authority this week that it is competing with Italian canned tomatoes dumped in Australia at up to 26% below cost. The only criteria that can explain the difference between the government\u2019s \u201cno\u201d to SPC and \u201cyes\u201d to Cadbury before the election is that the Cadbury decision came when the only line in the Coalition\u2019s sights was the election date. And the difference between helping a company struggling with dumped imports and a high dollar \u2013 both beyond its control \u2013 and farmers battling a drought beyond their control is also not yet clear.  With cabinet yet to decide on drought assistance, Hockey hedged his bets on that one.  \u201cThere are slight differences as there are differences between government stepping in when there is a natural \u00addisaster and governments stepping in when simply the company is asking for help with the financial restructure,\u201d he told the AFR. Still, the government is beginning to define a coherent economic direction. Now, following Tony Abbott\u2019s script of how-to-be-a-successful opposition leader, Bill Shorten is donning the high-vis vest to score political points from a government making difficult decisions. Shorten at least has actual job losses at Ford, and looming job losses at Holden, and most likely at SPC Ardmona, to bang on about. Abbott for the most part had to resort to wild conjecture to find the jobs about to be destroyed by the so-called \u201cwrecking ball\u201d of the carbon tax. But like opposition leader Abbott, Shorten is also taking the easy shots in the argument. He says governments should \u201cstand up for workers\u201d and \u201cfight for Aussie jobs\u201d, which is all very nice, but avoids the much more difficult question of exactly which industries should get assistance and in what circumstances. The Coalition has not yet explained how it will help the workers who will inevitably be left behind in Geelong, or Shepparton or Broadmeadows, even if its new economic strategy boosts overall growth and employment. And Labor has not explained how continued \u201cco-investment\u201d with carmakers and fruit canners will succeed in protecting Australian jobs in the future when billions of dollars of manufacturing \u201cco-investment\u2019 in the past hasn\u2019t prevented the inexorable contraction of the sector.

Amid growing concern at bulk-buying abroad of new London housing as &quot;buy-to-leave&quot; assets, the shadow housing minister, Emma Reynolds, said it was wrong that people living in the UK were being denied the chance to buy a home because they were &quot;being sold exclusively to overseas buyers&quot;. More than half of the 127 apartments in one recently built block in east London were sold to overseas buyers, with investors from Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong buying one in three for a total of \u00a325m, according to Land Registry records obtained by the Guardian. Ten homes in Bezier, a 14-storey apartment block in Islington, have been registered as empty with the town hall and only a third of the flats have anyone listed on the electoral roll. The pattern is being repeated across the capital. About 500 of the 866 flats proposed in the first phase of the Battersea Power Station redevelopment were sold in the far east, and this week campaigners against regeneration plans for Earls Court accused developers of acting to &quot;socially engineer middle- and low-income families out of central London&quot; because they say just 10% of the homes on the site will be genuinely affordable. The property industry attacked Labour&apos;s proposal. The British Property Federation said it could &quot;spook inward investment&quot; by imposing too many unnecessary restrictions on foreign capital. &quot;In the midst of a housing crisis, less housing development won&apos;t help anyone,&quot; said Ian Fletcher, the federation&apos;s director of policy.     Buyer nationalities for Bezier.    Jon Thompson, operations director of Tudor Vale, the developer of Bezier, said it would cut off essential upfront investment that UK buyers were reluctant to provide. &quot;Many schemes would not get off the ground, which would greatly reduce the amount of both private and affordable housing and put further upward pressure on prices,&quot; he said. He also disputed Islington&apos;s figures, which were gathered by electoral roll officials, and said he was aware of only four unoccupied apartments in the block. &quot;The vast majority are homes people come home to each night,&quot; he said. Bezier opened in 2010 in Old Street, beside a technology hub known as Silicon Roundabout. Hong Kong buyers bought six flats worth a combined \u00a33.4m, Malaysian owners bought 10 properties for \u00a35.7m and Singapore investors splashed out more than \u00a315m on 21 apartments. Other foreign owners are based in Dubai, Thailand, Australia, Italy and Brazil, as well as the British Virgin Islands tax haven. James Murray, Islington&apos;s executive member in charge of housing, said the situation was galling for people who were trying to continue living in London, and that it was wrong that flats were sold abroad and kept empty in a borough where 3,000 people are living in overcrowded conditions. Tim Griggs, 47, a private equity executive, who is among the 29% of Bezier owners who who gave their flat as their only address on Land Registry forms, said: &quot;There are a lot of Russian and Chinese people and some students are here for term time.&quot; Asked whether he felt the block was fully occupied, he said: &quot;I get the sense I can make a lot more noise that I would otherwise be allowed to. It works for me that it is not that busy.&quot; Griggs said the international makeup of such blocks was key to London&apos;s economy, a view supported by research published this week by Ramidus, a property research consultancy. &quot;Despite concern about foreign ownership of UK property, our research suggests foreign investors contribute considerably to the UK economy,&quot; said Sandra Jones, a consultant at the firm. &quot;Those with homes worth more between \u00a35m and \u00a315m spend \u00a32m-\u00a33m a year in the UK.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/07/bank-england-forex-price-fixing", "sentences": ["Ryan is former head of a foreign exchange trading desk at Citi in Singapore and joined Barclays as a director."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T18:36:25Z", "title": "Bank of England 'knew about' forex markets price fixing", "tags": ["Bank of England", "Business", "Financial Conduct Authority"], "article": "The Bank of England has been dragged into the mounting controversy over allegations of price fixing in the \u00a33tn-a-day foreign exchange markets after it emerged that a group of traders had told the Bank they were exchanging information about their clients&apos; position. The latest twist in the unfolding saga \u2013 already the subject of investigations by regulators around the world \u2013 puts the focus on a meeting between key officials at the central bank and leading foreign exchange dealers in April 2012, when they discussed the way they handled trades ahead of the crucial setting of a benchmark in the prices of major currencies. This benchmark is used to price a wide variety of financial products and is the subject of regulators&apos; attention amid allegations that traders at rival banks were sharing information about their orders from clients to manipulate the price. The Bank of England has previously released brief details of the April 2012 meeting, but Bloomberg reported that a senior trader who attended the meeting had made notes showing that officials did not believe it was improper to share customer orders. According to Bloomberg, there had been a 15-minute conversation on currency benchmarks during which traders said they used chatrooms \u2013 now banned by many banks \u2013 to trade ahead of the volatile period when the benchmarks were set. The notes have been given to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which is among the regulators \u2013 including ones in the US, Switzerland and Asia \u2013 investigating potential manipulation. The record of the meeting released by the Bank shows it was chaired by Martin Mallett, its chief currency dealer, and includes an entry entitled &quot;extra item&quot;. The record says: &quot;Processes around fixes. There was a brief discussion on extra levels of compliance that many bank trading desks were subject to when managing client risks around the main set-piece benchmark fixings.&quot; The Bank would not provide any additional information about the meeting of its so-called foreign exchange joint standing committee and said it was &quot;continuing to support&quot; the FCA with its investigation. As the FCA&apos;s investigation becomes more detailed, it would be in traders&apos; interests to suggest that the Bank knew about their activities, which they raised at a time when there was increasing scrutiny of the Libor setting process. The latter has since resulted in huge fines for Barclays, UBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, Icap and Rabobank. More Libor fines are expected. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the FCA, told MPs on the Treasury select committee at the start of this week that the allegations were &quot;every bit as bad&quot; as those surrounding Libor. The chairman of that committee, Conservative MP Andrew Tyrie, on Friday said the allegations were &quot;extremely serious&quot; and urged the government to implement regulatory changes recommended by the parliamentary commission on banking standards, which he also chaired, and was set up in the wake of the Libor scandal, which he also chaired. Tyrie said: &quot;These included making individuals personally responsible for lapses in standards, supported by sanctions. Among the most important were the commission&apos;s recommendations that remuneration incentivise good, not poor, behaviour. A fundamental reform of the structure of variable pay \u2013 which, for too long, has incentivised people to do the wrong thing \u2013 is needed.&quot; In December it was reported that banks had known about the processes around setting the benchmark as long ago as 2009. The scrutiny of the foreign exchange markets has put a fresh focus on dealers leaving banks. More than 20 traders at banks around the world are said to have been suspended or left roles in connection with the forex investigations. Graeme King, co-head of foreign exchange spot trading at RBC Capital Markets, was said to have left. The bank said: &quot;We do not comment on employee matters, but any suggestion that this is related to the broader FX regulatory investigations is incorrect.&quot; Barclays has also appointed an interim head of its foreign exchange desk after Chris Ashton was suspended. He is Daniel Ryan, who only joined a year ago and was described as &quot;junior trader&quot; by the Financial Times. Ryan is former head of a foreign exchange trading desk at Citi in Singapore and joined Barclays as a director."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/09/india-implement-cricket-decision-review-system", "sentences": ["The controversial reforms to the ICC were ratified at the weekend in Singapore, conferring greater power on England, Australia and especially India as the three major wealth-generators of world cricket, with N Srinivasan, the chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, to become the ICC chairman in July.", "Another significant development from the ICC&apos;s Singapore meeting was the confirmation of England&apos;s leading role in opening up a route into Test cricket for associate nations, including Ireland and Afghanistan."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-09T21:25:00Z", "title": "India leans toward implementing hi-tech cricket decision review system", "tags": ["International Cricket Council", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "India may be ready to accept more responsibility for improving the decision review system (DRS) as part of their new leadership role in the International Cricket Council (ICC). The controversial reforms to the ICC were ratified at the weekend in Singapore, conferring greater power on England, Australia and especially India as the three major wealth-generators of world cricket, with N Srinivasan, the chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, to become the ICC chairman in July. Within hours India were left to rue their consistent opposition to DRS, as they were left without recourse to technology to overturn a poor decision, which was crucial as they went down to defeat by New Zealand in the first Test in Auckland. But their willingness to listen afresh to the arguments in favour of DRS, and to play a key role in working on it rather than railing against it, had already been established. The chief executives committee of the ICC had a lengthy session on DRS in Dubai two weeks ago, in which David Collier, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, played a leading role and the former India leg-spinner Anil Kumble was also involved. That is likely to see the amended implementation of DRS that was trialled by Nigel Llong in the Old Trafford car park during last summer&apos;s Ashes series, whereby a television official will be given greater access to a wide range of replays, which will be introduced for the first time at a major tournament at the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh next month. But in the longer term there are hopes that India will take the lead in refining technology \u2013 Australia previously led in the development of Hot Spot and Real Time Snicko \u2013 in an effort to reduce the number of errors and controversies and to ensure more robust testing procedures. Another significant development from the ICC&apos;s Singapore meeting was the confirmation of England&apos;s leading role in opening up a route into Test cricket for associate nations, including Ireland and Afghanistan. England have left a space in their Future Tours Programme, to be announced shortly, for the Ashes summer of 2019 to play a Test against the winners of the next Intercontinental Cup, if that team also win the play-off against the bottom-ranked full ICC member in 2018. That opens up the real possibility of Ireland playing their inaugural Test at Lord&apos;s in the spring of 2019 \u2013 and &quot;breaking the glass ceiling&quot;, as it was described in the ICC&apos;s post-meeting statement. The proposals were ratified 8\u20130 by the 10 full ICC members. Of the three that had queried the ICC&apos;s description of &quot;unanimous support&quot; for the plans when they were discussed in Dubai last month Sri Lanka and Pakistan abstained and South Africa voted in favour. India confirmed shortly after the meeting that talks were under way with South Africa about a bilateral agreement for series between the countries. South Africa were recently left counting the substantial cost of India shortening their tour this winter to allow Sachin Tendulkar to play his farewell Test on home soil."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/social-media-green-tech-sustainable-communities", "sentences": ["In Singapore three million patients, or 60% of the population, are seen by doctors through remote consultations on digital media."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-10T07:00:00Z", "title": "Social media and green tech helps create sustainable communities", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Community", "Communities", "Environment", "Solar power", "Technology", "Social media", "Local government"], "article": "Recent flooding and other extreme weather events are the most obvious signs that unless we live more sustainably we will face increasingly biblical consequences. Literal storms have arrived within a dreadful economic climate, leading to cuts that threaten the social care, health and other services that an ageing and unhealthy population relies on in increasing numbers. Industrialisation and hi-tech financial markets helped get us into this mess. Now technology, if used to empower people and communities, holds the key to creating a sustainable future. Take waste as an example. It was not so long ago that all waste was chucked into one bin that would be emptied into a giant landfill site, poisoning land, water and air. Now in London, Lambeth council runs a system where food waste is collected separately to be anaerobically digested creating fuel and compost for farming. Recyclables are sorted at a high-tech plant for use as new materials while the small amount of waste that is left over is incinerated to create energy. Since November, when this new system was rolled out with a social media campaign, recycling has increased by 34% and waste is down by one third or 8,000 tonnes. None of this would be possible without residents feeling they are part of a collective effort, doing their bit by separating waste for everyone&apos;s benefit. Meanwhile in the same south London borough an unlikely challenger to the &apos;big six&apos; energy companies is rising from some of the poorest social housing estates in the country. Brixton Energy, a co-operative owned and run by local residents and workers, has placed hundreds of solar panels on the roofs of blocks of flats. Investors get a 3% return for financing the set-up costs and local people benefit from jobs, training and money back on their service charge. Social media has helped Lambeth council recruit hundreds of &apos;green champions&apos; to support communities to take action to improve their environment. The borough now has 60 environmental groups and 150 community food growing projects reducing pollution and traffic whilst encouraging people to work together, learn new skills, exercise and produce healthy food. This is part of the area&apos;s efforts to improve the health of residents and technology has an important part to play. In Singapore three million patients, or 60% of the population, are seen by doctors through remote consultations on digital media. In the UK, telemedicine is nothing like as widespread but it is improving access and outcomes while also cutting costs and waiting times. Across the country, councils and the NHS are investing in telecare and telehealth services which use technology to help people live more independently at home. As well as digital consultations they include personal alarms and health-monitoring devices. Sensors can check whether a person has had a fall, got back into bed safely, has a high heart rate, blood pressure or blood sugar level and alert a family member, warden or health and social care service. Nearly everyone wants to stay in their own home as long as possible and technology makes this possible for longer which also saves the taxpayer the cost of residential care. From generating green energy and improving recycling to enabling independence and reducing isolation technology has great potential to help our communities become more environmentally, economically and socially sustainable. The trick is to ensure that such technologies are used to connect people in a common endeavour and that those who most need it, the poorest and the oldest, are not excluded through lack of resources or support.

It is certainly true that the bank is committed to paying competitively. From &quot;Singapore to San Francisco&quot;, as Jenkins put it, Barclays wants to go head-to-head with JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs to hire and retain the investment bankers it values most highly. But pay for performance? Nonsense. Pre-tax profits in the investment bank fell 37% last year to \u00a32.52bn and return on equity plunged from 12.7% to 8.2%. A performance of that sort demands a cut in bonuses, not a 13% increase. Jenkins and Barclays have breached two understandings with shareholders. The first is the general principle that the bonuses are meant to adapt to the financial weather. Banks themselves prefer the term &quot;variable compensation&quot; \u2013 awards are meant to go up in sunny years and down in a downpour. But Jenkins is now citing a sub-clause in this unwritten contract. &quot;After careful consideration, we determined that an increase of \u00a3210m over the prior year in the incentive pool was required in 2013 in order to build our franchise in the long-term interests of shareholders.&quot; In other words, Barclays feels long-term franchise-building, however vaguely expressed, trumps the need to tie annual rewards to annual performance. This is not &quot;pay for performance&quot; as the outside world understands the term. It is more like &quot;pay for performance that we hope will occur one day provided JP Morgan et al don&apos;t ramp up bonuses even higher and if trading bonds becomes interesting again&quot;. The second breach of understanding with shareholders is specific. A year ago Barclays declared that a &quot;turning point&quot; had been reached on pay and that shareholders would get a fairer cut in future. Here&apos;s Sir John Sunderland in last year&apos;s annual report: &quot;For 2012 and in future we are taking a different approach to the balance between directors&apos; and employees&apos; remuneration, and returns for shareholders.&quot; That statement still holds, Barclays tried to suggest on Tuesday: medium-term targets for compensation-to-income ratios have not been altered. Really? Sceptical shareholders will feel that &quot;medium term&quot; is a flexible term at Barclays; the phrase seems to mean whatever management wishes it to mean. Jenkins, to give him some credit, is getting a few things right at Barclays. But his line on bonuses is absurd. What he has revealed is that when &quot;pay for performance&quot; and &quot;competitive pay&quot; come into conflict, Barclays will choose the latter. Jenkins&apos; soundbites may be more customer-friendly than his predecessors&apos;, but his protection of the bonuses of senior staff at the expense of shareholders&apos; rewards is straight out of the John Varley/Bob Diamond era. Barclays is still being run for its staff, not its owners."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/11/barclays-hikes-bonuses-profits-slide", "sentences": ["&quot;We employ people from Singapore to San Francisco."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-11T20:28:00Z", "title": "Barclays condemned over \u00a32.4bn bonuses", "tags": ["Barclays", "Banking", "Business", "Executive pay and bonuses", "UK news", "Antony Jenkins"], "article": "Barclays faced condemnation on Tuesday after announcing a 10% rise in bonus payouts despite a dramatic fall in profits and plans to cut 12,000 jobs this year. The bank&apos;s new boss, Antony Jenkins, came under intense pressure after being accused of failing on promises made only a year ago to clamp down on pay and change the culture of the bank after its \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor. The TUC accused the bank of &quot;sticking two fingers up to hard-pressed families across Britain&quot;, while the Unite union was furious at further cuts at the retail bank, which could harm customer service. But the harshest words came from the Institute of Directors, whose corporate governance director Roger Barker asked &quot;for whom is this institution being run?&quot; after the bank paid out \u00a32.4bn in bonuses but just \u00a3860m in dividends to shareholders. The bank disputes that figure, but refused to say exactly how much it is paying out to shareholders, which has been complicated by last year&apos;s \u00a35.8bn rights issue, forced upon Barclays by the Bank of England to boost its financial strength. The main investor body, the Association British of Insurers, refused to respond to Barker&apos;s accusation that investors were &quot;supine&quot; in failing to control pay at\u00a0Barclays. The position of the bank&apos;s chair of remuneration committee Sir John Sutherland \u2013 appointed to the role only 18 months ago \u2013 was also questioned. Sunderland is entering his 10th year on the board, after which he is technically no longer deemed independent. The total bonus pay for 2013 is \u00a32.4bn \u2013 up from \u00a32.2bn a year ago. Within that, the investment bankers enjoyed bonuses of \u00a31.6bn compared with \u00a31.4bn a year ago, even though their division suffered a loss in the fourth quarter and its annual profits tumbled 37%. Profits across the group, which also includes high street banking, Barclaycard and operations in Africa, fell 32% to \u00a35.2bn. On a statutory basis \u2013 including accounting quirks and other one-off items \u2013 the profits were higher, at \u00a32.9bn. Frances O&apos;Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: &quot;Barclays has stuck two fingers up to hard-pressed families across Britain by announcing another multibillion-pound bonus pool.&quot; Labour said its bonus tax should be reintroduced. Jenkins, who has waived his own \u00a32.7m bonus, insisted he had the support of shareholders for the higher bonuses, which had to be paid because he had no control over market-led pay. He also insisted the bank was acting within the &quot;spirit and letter&quot; of the law by paying monthly &quot;allowances&quot; to key staff who might otherwise face pay cuts as a result of the new EU cap on bonuses, which will limit payouts next year to 100% of salary, or 200% if shareholders approve. &quot;We employ people from Singapore to San Francisco. We compete in global markets for talent. If we are to act in the best interests of our shareholders we have to make sure we have the best people in the firm,&quot; Jenkins said. The average bonus per member of staff, across the bank, is \u00a317,000, up from \u00a315,600. However, the average payout in the investment banking operation is \u00a360,100, up from \u00a354,500 \u2013 including payouts to low level and administrative staff. The bonuses to the highest paid staff will be revealed next month when the bank publishes its annual report. Last year, it handed more than \u00a31m to 428 of its bankers. Jenkins said 820 senior roles \u2013 or 10% \u2013 would be cut. He also disputed concerns about the impact of job cuts on customer service. Seven thousand of the 12,000 job cuts will be in the UK but not all in the high street.  &quot;The reason why we&apos;re doing this is not because we&apos;re trying to deliver poorer customer service, actually quite the reverse. Customers can now do their banking when its convenient to them, not \u2026 us. Technology allows [us] to reduce headcount,&quot; said Jenkins. There was no programme for branch closures, he said, but conceded the 1,700-strong network was changing. Vince Cable, the business secretary, said: &quot;We need a responsible banking sector [that] rejects the bonus-fuelled culture of the past and puts the needs of consumers and businesses at the heart of what they\u00a0do.&quot; Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, said Barclays&apos; shareholders needed to ask if the pay was justified by the bank&apos;s returns to shareholders. Even the presentation to City analysts was dominated by questions about bonuses and the investment bank. &quot;Analysts were &quot;perplexed&quot; and &quot;disappointed&quot; by the investment bank pay rises,&quot; said independent analyst Louise\u00a0Cooper. A year ago, when Jenkins announced his plan to turn Barclays into the &quot;go to&quot; bank, the shares rose 9% to 327p. On Tuesday, they were the biggest fallers in the FTSE 100, ending nearly 4% lower at 264p.

The government is considering offering Qantas a \u201cstandby\u201d or emergency debt guarantee after two ratings agencies downgraded its credit rating to \u201cjunk\u201d status. The move would not require legislation. The company, and some Coalition backbenchers, have been lobbying for changes to the Qantas Sales Act to remove the requirement for majority Australian ownership and allow foreign investors to hold more than 49%. But the Labor party and the Greens have ruled out support for the amendment in the Senate, meaning it could not pass parliament before the new Senate sits in July. In his speech, Joyce acknowledged that neither a direct cash injection nor legislative change was possible. \u201cWe have never asked for a handout. And we are not asking for one now \u2026 The Qantas Sale Act limits our financial options, it adds cost to our business and it influences our actions as a publicly listed company.

It\u2019s hard to take a taxi in Bangkok after a Thailand game and not be told that the team needs a modern version of legendary 80s striker Piyapong Pue-on. Part of the deal of being a Malaysian fan is to mention \u2018Super\u2019 Mokhtar Dahari, the tree-trunk thighed terroriser of 70s and 80s defences and there are the Barcelona antics of the Filipino goal machine Paolo Alcantara that have caused many a misty-eyed Manila night. The present is not quite as glorious. One-by-one, after falling behind those in west and east Asia, the region\u2019s teams have fallen by the wayside en route to the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia next January. Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam have played a combined total of 15 qualifiers and managed one point between them. Then Singapore were put out of their misery in the early days of the Chinese Year of the Horse, leaving just Malaysia with a chance of representing south-east Asia next January \u2013 and even that is far from certain. Failure would leave a region of 600 million without representation again while roughly 150 million in west Asia have eight and counting \u2013 talk about underachievement. The sad truth is that match-fixing is the most likely topic in the international media when you read about football connected to Malaysia or Singapore. If it\u2019s Indonesia then it is going to be about political chaos or players dying after not getting paid and being unable to afford medical treatment and if it\u2019s Myanmar then perhaps it\u2019s crowd trouble and if it\u2019s another country, well, you are probably not reading about the other countries at all unless it is about another pre-season tour by an English Premier League giant. In most of the region, you can watch pretty much every English top-tier clash live every weekend. Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal (even after Saturday) shirts are common sights and exhibition games are as popular as they are expensive. In Singapore, football-lovers gather round in cafes and restaurants while ignoring the local S-League. In truth, the Premier League can be an easy target and blaming it for ASEAN ills is an oversimplification but it does cast a long shadow that makes it that little bit tougher for the local game to find a place in the sun. Corruption is a much bigger threat. Stories of match-fixing still abound in Malaysia creating a climate of suspicion. When a T-Team goalkeeper let in a corner last season, he was immediately hauled off, then literally pushed off, the pitch by English coach Peter Butler. But incompetence and politics are just as damaging. Powerful people are attracted to the beautiful game in the region and often local media either can\u2019t or won\u2019t call them to account. What has happened in Indonesia will become a case study for how not to run a country\u2019s football scene. It remains the only ASEAN participant in a World Cup (back in 1938 under the guise of Dutch East Indies) but now has the distinction of being the country with the highest potential but the lowest standard of governance. Fifa allowing a convicted criminal to run the national FA from his prison cell and return to his office upon release was breathtaking as were the eventual results that included the setting up of rebel leagues and federations, fan deaths, player deaths, player strikes and a whole lot more. Being caught in December in the Fifa rankings by Guam, an island with less than one thousandth of Indonesia\u2019s population, was another low.  At the national team level, repeated failure reinforces a negative tendency for south-east Asia to retreat into itself. It has become something of a football bubble with the national teams playing each other far too often outside the AFF Suzuki Cup. This biennial ASEAN tournament is far more colourful than equivalents in east, south or west Asia but few elsewhere care. The region does not yet export players to Europe to any significant extent and those who go overseas often leave amid fanfares before returning home quickly and quietly. There are occasionally wildly ambitious plans with major clubs in the big leagues such as the Thai trio who went to Manchester City in 2007 thanks to former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Exports to Australia and Melbourne victory were more successful but have not been built upon. Japan\u2019s J-League is eager to build links with the region and Indonesian star Irfan Bachdim has just signed for top tier club Ventforet Kofu in a move that needs to be a success, even just a moderate one.  Most of what progress has been made has come at club level where money can have a swift impact and while it is sporadic, some leagues are starting to be taken seriously. When Melbourne Victory take on Muangthong United in the final play-off of the Asian Champions League, they will be meeting a well-run, well-financed and well-supported outfit. The club from just north of Bangkok are setting standards in the Thai Premier League along with Buriram United. Buriram, owned by well-known politician and former Thakshin ally, Newin Chidchob, reached the last eight of the Asian Champions League last season, disposing of Brisbane Roar in the playoffs before finishing above Japan\u2019s Vegalta Sendai and China\u2019s Jiangsu Sainty. Then Uzbek powerhouse Bunyodkor was seen off in the second round. It was no fluke. The Malaysian league is also on the move, match-fixing controversies notwithstanding. While the likes of Vincent Tan and Tony Fernandes are investing money in the UK, there are others spending big in the former British colony. Pablo Aimar is with newly rich Johor DT and the Argentinian scored a beauty at the weekend even if his star-studded team lost 3-2 to a Pahang FC coached by Ron Smith and marshalled at the back by former Fulham defender Zesh Rehman. Attendances in the new season are booming. Malaysia and Thailand provide some cause for optimism but it is not enough. Standards are rising \u2013 though the same is true of almost everywhere \u2013 with some decent young talent coming through though it comes through slower than it should, held back as it is by a lack of good coaching at youth levels. Youth development, or the lack of it, is perhaps the biggest failing of all with too much meddling, politics, short-sightedness and not enough investment in the right areas and patience.  It will happen one day. Not in time for the 2015 Asian Cup or 2018 World Cup and probably a little beyond that but one day, south east Asia is going to shake off the politics, the incompetence, the corruption, the short-sightedness and the parochialism and become a genuine power in Asia with new heroes."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/feb/13/unaffordable-cities-singapore-workers-millionaire-island", "sentences": ["It is a balmy Saturday afternoon in the suburbs of Singapore.", "Patricia, 21, and her partner Sham, 28, share their first meal of the day: a box of chicken nuggets at McDonald&apos;s. &quot;It&apos;s getting much harder to survive in Singapore,&quot; Patricia says between bites.", "In Singapore, with its sky-high housing prices and conservative Asian values, most young people have no choice but to live with their parents until they get married.", "She is undereducated by Singapore&apos;s standards, with only n-levels (below high school) and an ITE (technical college) certificate in nursing, and earns S$1,400 (\u00a3670) per month.", "In a country where a small, two-room condominium unit in the city centre can fetch a monthly rental of S$5,000 or more, Patricia pays a pricy S$850 a month to rent a non air-conditioned room in a flat at Admiralty, a suburban area in the north of Singapore, a 90-minute commute by public transport to her workplace.", "&quot;Definitely life is hard, with the increasing costs in Singapore,&quot; Patricia says.", "Though I know I&apos;m suffering inside, I still motivate and push myself to work harder.&quot; A 2013 white paper on increasing Singapore&apos;s population to a recommended 6.9 million by 2030 made reference to nursing as a low-skilled job.", "Even if it is, passion is paying me peanuts!&quot;     A man walks along the corridor of a public housing estate in the Katong area of Singapore, 2011.", "Don&apos;t nurses have the right to sit down, too, or are we supposed to stand throughout our journey?&quot; Patricia&apos;s situation stands starkly against the case of Anton Casey, a British wealth manager who ignited the wrath of Singaporeans when he referred to public transport commuters as &quot;poor people&quot;.", "Despite apologising publicly, Casey and his family (he&apos;s married to a former Miss Singapore) were forced to leave the country and he was also fired.", "In 2001, Singapore was ranked 97th in the list of world&apos;s most expensive cities.", "Singapore does not have a minimum wage, and Sham felt this most acutely when she was forced to work for S$900 a month doing essentially the same job (dog handling) that she used to get S$2,500 for at a different company.", "A study by the National University of Singapore&apos;s (NUS) social-work department stated that &quot;the working poor in Singapore \u2026 is defined as someone earning less than half of the average monthly income of a Singaporean, which now stands at S$3,000&quot;.", "Photograph: Marc Nair for the Guardian    But Singapore&apos;s minister for social and family development, Chan Chun Sing, has said the government doesn&apos;t want to define a poverty line in Singapore.", "&quot;We don&apos;t feel poor because we have each other,&quot; says Patricia, looking at Sham, &quot;but knowing how rich some people are in Singapore, I think we are poor&quot;.", "In contrast, it&apos;s coming up roses for a growing upper class \u2013 17% of Singapore&apos;s population has a net worth of over S$1m and more rich individuals are flocking here, drawn by the low corporate tax rate, no capital gains or estate tax, and a personal income tax capped at 20%.", "Jim Rogers, the famed American investor, now resides in Singapore.", "He has said &quot;Singapore is the most successful country of the past 40 years."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T07:00:00Z", "title": "Unaffordable cities: Singapore workers tread water on millionaires' island", "tags": ["Cities", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "It is a balmy Saturday afternoon in the suburbs of Singapore.

But what choice do I have?&quot; Patricia recently moved out of her parents&apos; house to be with Sham. In Singapore, with its sky-high housing prices and conservative Asian values, most young people have no choice but to live with their parents until they get married. Singles cannot apply for public housing until they turn 35. Patricia works full time as a nurse in a government hospital. She is undereducated by Singapore&apos;s standards, with only n-levels (below high school) and an ITE (technical college) certificate in nursing, and earns S$1,400 (\u00a3670) per month.

Her monthly rental does not entitle her to the use of her landlord&apos;s kitchen, so she has to eat out for all her meals. &quot;Definitely life is hard, with the increasing costs in Singapore,&quot; Patricia says. &quot;Somehow I buck up and struggle through these storms. Though I know I&apos;m suffering inside, I still motivate and push myself to work harder.&quot; A 2013 white paper on increasing Singapore&apos;s population to a recommended 6.9 million by 2030 made reference to nursing as a low-skilled job.

But I won&apos;t get a seat to rest in the train and moreover, when I&apos;m in my nursing uniform, people expect me to give up my seat. Don&apos;t nurses have the right to sit down, too, or are we supposed to stand throughout our journey?&quot; Patricia&apos;s situation stands starkly against the case of Anton Casey, a British wealth manager who ignited the wrath of Singaporeans when he referred to public transport commuters as &quot;poor people&quot;. He also posted a status update about washing &quot;the stench of public transport off me&quot; once he had gotten his Porsche back from the workshop. Despite apologising publicly, Casey and his family (he&apos;s married to a former Miss Singapore) were forced to leave the country and he was also fired. In 2001, Singapore was ranked 97th in the list of world&apos;s most expensive cities. Ten years later, it was ranked sixth. Ongoing inflation means that basic amenities such as food continue to rise without an equivalent match in real wages. According to Hui Weng Tat, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy: &quot;We have a large number of households who are earning income in the lower end and not having enough to cover their household expenditure, especially at the lower 20%.&quot; This hits home hard for Patricia and Sham, who have to eke out a living on Patricia&apos;s salary alone. Singapore does not have a minimum wage, and Sham felt this most acutely when she was forced to work for S$900 a month doing essentially the same job (dog handling) that she used to get S$2,500 for at a different company. This was a precipitating factor in causing Sham to seek employment elsewhere. But it seemed companies didn&apos;t take too kindly to a gay Indian girl with a penchant for dressing boyishly. She was rejected from numerous job interviews even before being seen. She says, not without irony, &quot;Dogs don&apos;t discriminate against you&quot;. A study by the National University of Singapore&apos;s (NUS) social-work department stated that &quot;the working poor in Singapore \u2026 is defined as someone earning less than half of the average monthly income of a Singaporean, which now stands at S$3,000&quot;. The World Bank&apos;s poverty line is set at 50% of the country&apos;s mean income.     'They say nursing is about passion but passion is paying me peanuts.' Photograph: Marc Nair for the Guardian    But Singapore&apos;s minister for social and family development, Chan Chun Sing, has said the government doesn&apos;t want to define a poverty line in Singapore. The reason is to avoid a cliff effect, where families narrowly above the poverty line will not be privy to the subsidies and benefits offered to families below the line. &quot;We don&apos;t feel poor because we have each other,&quot; says Patricia, looking at Sham, &quot;but knowing how rich some people are in Singapore, I think we are poor&quot;.\u00a0 In contrast, it&apos;s coming up roses for a growing upper class \u2013 17% of Singapore&apos;s population has a net worth of over S$1m and more rich individuals are flocking here, drawn by the low corporate tax rate, no capital gains or estate tax, and a personal income tax capped at 20%.

In 2012, it made a large investment in website Pinterest. \u201cThis combination presents an amazing opportunity for Viber to enhance our rapid user growth in both existing and new markets,\u201d said Marco in a statement. \u201cSharing similar aspirations with Rakuten, our vision is to be the world\u2019s number one communications platform and our combination with Rakuten is an important step in that direction.\u201d Viber is one of the top five most downloaded smartphone phone call and messaging apps, and counts the United States, Russia and Australia among its biggest markets. It recently launched an instant messaging app for personal computers that allows users to make outgoing mobile calls to other Viber users and non-registered mobiles, making it a rival to Skype. Its 300 million registered users represents growth of over 120% in 2013. But the company is tight-lipped about how many of its users are \u201cactive\u201d, rather than merely signed-up for the service. By indicators such as tweets or google search activity, it appears tiny in comparison to competitors such as Skype and Whatsapp. The acquisition by Rakuten is expected to be completed by the end of March, both companies said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/feb/14/un-sustainable-development-goals-forests", "sentences": ["Consider an example from June of last year, when rampant fires across parts of Sumatra, Indonesia, shrouded the skies of Sumatra and neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia in a thick, choking haze."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-14T17:43:41Z", "title": "Forests: time to reclaim the 'wastelands'?", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Environment", "Trees and forests", "Global development", "Climate change", "Sustainable development", "Environmental sustainability", "Millennium development goals", "Policy and advocacy", "Research"], "article": "Earlier this month, the UN open working group on the sustainable development goals (SDGs) proposed a framework to replace the millennium development goals (MDGs), which expire in 2015. The SDGs are meant to guide global action on health, poverty, hunger, climate and other development challenges. The key component of the SDGs, as its name indicates, is to help the world deliver food, health and empowerment for all sustainably, without exceeding the Earth&apos;s resource limits or contributing to climate change. The future of the world&apos;s forests, one of several topics on the table lies in the balance of these and subsequent discussions. Forests are fundamental to maintaining water supplies, providing economic goods, mitigating climate change, and housing biodiversity \u2013 furnishing billions of the world&apos;s poorest with income, food and medicine. Global policymakers know well the immense value of forests \u2013 so why have development interventions largely failed to harness the positive contributions of forested landscapes? Our work at the Center for International Forestry Research has found three possible reasons. For one, government sectors and actors managing rural development are fragmented. On a sectoral level, for example, forests and agriculture have long been inextricably linked \u2013 the most negative illustration of which is the clearing of forests to make way for farms - in the 10 seconds it takes to read this sentence, about 10 acres (four hectares) of forests are cleared, predominantly for agriculture. And with respect to actors, you would think there would be more communication between national ministries and other institutions that govern forests and agriculture to find joint solutions, but that is not always so \u2013 when it comes to land-use planning, very often we have found that ministries within the same country aren&apos;t even working off the same maps. Secondly, forests and land are undervalued and have been for a long time. This becomes evident when we try to put price tags on forest functions. Research shows that a billion people around the world derive their livelihoods from forest resources \u2013 and that forests provide one-fifth of income for the rural poor. Still, this is rarely included in corporate accounting or national planning. Too often, forested lands are treated as &quot;wastelands&quot; or &quot;free&quot; and easily cleared for agricultural and infrastructure expansion. But not only do we fall short in valuing environmental goods \u2013 we also fail to account for the &quot;bads.&quot; Environmental damage is only beginning to be included in natural resources accounting practices, acknowledging that many of these damages can have a negative effect on profits. Lastly, governance is weak and inconsistent. Local and regional practices are different and often don&apos;t match with national policies; national policies cannot keep up with impacts that international trade and investment flows have on forests; and international initiatives \u2013 like timber certification or environmental conventions \u2013 can succeed only if they consider local realities and are meaningful to local stakeholders, which is rarely the case. And in many countries, tenure rights are so nebulous that it is difficult to know who has the rights of access to forests, leaving a vacuum open to unbridled exploitation. What happens when all these problems collide? Consider an example from June of last year, when rampant fires across parts of Sumatra, Indonesia, shrouded the skies of Sumatra and neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia in a thick, choking haze. The fires, which had devastating impacts on people and the environment, were not a natural disaster, but rather the product of a combination of weak law enforcement, short-sighted economic interests, and lack of political and policy coordination at different levels. In response to the haze crisis, actors across multiple sectors in the region have begun to come together and work toward joint solutions. So what does this have to do with the SDGs? How can the world&apos;s next &quot;road map&quot; for global development forge joint solutions and steer a path to well-being without leaving forests behind? I submit that there are two possible ways that can complement each other. The first is to make forests an essential element in the soon-to-be chosen SDGs. We must recognise that forests are critical to achieving several goals, and so the indicators and targets by which we measure success must reflect the values I have listed above. For example, if we create a goal on &quot;access to safe drinking water,&quot; then this goal should recognise the invaluable services that forested watersheds provide. Moreover, these goals, indicators and targets must be designed in a way that encourages synergies and manages trade-offs. By comparison, the MDGs only looked at forests under what is known as goal 7, or the environment goal. The SDGs should consider the broader contributions that forests can make towards the future we want. The second option would be to include a specific goal on sustainable landscapes. A &quot;landscape,&quot; simply put, comprises the natural environment as well as the people who live in and manage a given area. This SDG would consider several landscape targets, like livelihood provision, sustained ecosystem services, control of pollution (especially carbon emissions, the central cause of climate change), resource efficiency and the production of food and non-food products \u2013 all benefits that forests provide or play a role in providing. With an SDG on sustainable landscapes, we could focus on balancing human development with environmental sustainability and so stay within planetary boundaries. The SDGs, if developed correctly, are not &apos;pie in the sky&apos; or utopian, but the keys to developing and measuring a sustainable planet. The MDGs made major tangible gains in slashing world hunger, rates of HIV/Aids and infant mortality while increasing access to maternal care and primary education. However, the MDGs were unable to reverse environmental degradation, increasing emissions and rising social inequality. The SDGs can go a long way in tacking these issues. They also offer a real chance to recognise the potential of the world&apos;s forests to contribute to solving the many challenges that lie ahead. Let&apos;s not miss that chance.

A part of me still feels that way, but what makes this one stand out is that it is not simply an account of the events of 1994. It brings the story right up to date, confronting the dilemmas and tensions that lie not far below the surface in that most tragic and beautiful of countries. Belton is a television journalist who was first dispatched to Rwanda at the time of the genocide and who has since\u00a0been back several times. This elegantly written book is part personal\u00a0odyssey, part history, but above all it is a tribute to one remarkable man, a Bosnian Croat Franciscan priest, Vjeko Curic, who, almost alone among foreigners, stayed\u00a0throughout the slaughter and in\u00a0so doing saved many lives. No recitation of bald statistics can do justice to the nightmare. It is enough to note that in the space of less than 100 days 800,000 men, women and children were murdered, many chopped to pieces with machetes. The victims were mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe. The killers were mainly Hutus, the majority ethnic group. The killers were not some alien species or invading army, they were the former friends and neighbours of those they slaughtered, goaded into an orgy of hatred by an evil, insane regime determined to achieve ethnic purity. Nor was the picture unremittingly bleak; everywhere there were acts of heroism: Hutus who refused to participate in the killing, who sheltered Tutsi neighbours and who, in many cases, paid with their lives. Belton tells the story in three time frames: 1994, 2004 and 2012-2013. The genocide he recounts by painstakingly reconstructing the experience of two people \u2013 Jean-Pierre, his driver and fixer, and Father Curic. Jean-Pierre survived, with the help of a Zairean friend, by hiding for two months and 16 days in a disused septic tank. He emerged to find that while, remarkably,\u00a0his wife and children had\u00a0survived, his parents and seven of\u00a0his 10 siblings had not. Father Curic, a latter-day Schindler, looms large throughout. A handsome, fearless, irrepressible, whisky-drinking bundle of energy, bribing, cajoling, bullying. One minute giving sanctuary to terrified Tutsi, the next smuggling them out of the country in a\u00a0compartment on the underside of his lorry. We first come across him driving into the capital, Kigali, as the slaughter begins, to rescue a Tutsi businessman. Confronted by members of the Hutu presidential guard at a roadblock, he tells them that he is en route to collect his cook and offers them $500 for safe conduct. As he drops them back at the roadblock, one of the soldiers leans into the car and fixes the rescued man with a hard stare. &quot;I know he is not your cook,&quot; he says. &quot;No one pays that kind of money for a cook.&quot; Before long Curic is organising convoys of food and medical supplies from the Red Cross in neighbouring Burundi to the thousands of desperate\u00a0Tutsi seeking sanctuary at the nearby cathedral and elsewhere. Each trip involves running the gauntlet\u00a0of a dozen or more roadblocks\u00a0and at every one the criminals manning them have to be bribed, and appeased. When some semblance of order is eventually restored, Curic redirects his efforts into\u00a0building homes and feeding the tens of thousands of alleged genocidaires who\u00a0clog the local jail.     Franciscan priest Vjeko Curic, who helped many Tutsis escape slaughter and was assassinated in 1998.    Perhaps it was inevitable that sooner or later the priest would fall foul of the new authorities. He soon noticed that, for all the talk of reconciliation and justice, revenge killings by forces loyal to the new regime went uninvestigated. Soon he was heard complaining that &quot;life had been simple during the genocide: there were the victims and there were the killers. Now Rwanda was a seething mass of local jealousies and ethnic rivalries&quot;. Curic survived several attempts on his life and cheerfully ignored warnings that he should leave until, in January 1998, he was shot dead in broad daylight. His assassin was briefly detained by passersby, but\u00a0escaped. His death remains unexplained to this day. In many respects, as Belton acknowledges, Rwanda&apos;s progress in the 20 years since the genocide has been remarkable. To be sure, the country is for all practical purposes a one-party state ruled by a Tutsi elite, but great order prevails under heaven. As anyone who has spent time there will testify, there is an energy and efficiency about the new Rwanda that is generally lacking in most other\u00a0parts of Africa. Singapore, not Africa, is the role model. Officially at least there is no more talk of Tutsi and\u00a0Hutu, only of Rwandans. And yet, as Belton soon discovers, one does not have to scratch hard to discover that all is not as it seems. Is it possible, he asks the president, Paul Kagame, for Rwanda to outpace its ethnic past? &quot;There is a long pause. The two presidential aides sit motionless\u2026 when he next speaks his voice is whispery quiet. &apos;We have to,&apos; he\u00a0says. &apos;We have no choice.&apos;&quot; Chris Mullin is a former Africa minister and the author of three volumes of diaries"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/feb/16/george-wilson-obituary", "sentences": ["Appointed OBE on return to the UK, he went to Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and each of the Caribbean colonies to advise on arrangements leading to independence."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-16T16:26:55Z", "title": "George Wilson obituary", "tags": ["Civil service", "Politics", "NHS", "Health", "Society"], "article": "My father, George Wilson, who has died aged 92, had humble beginnings in a small village in north Cumbria but went on to play important roles in the preparation of British colonies for independence and in the development of the NHS and the social security system. He was born in Wetheral, Cumbria, moving soon after to Blaydon near Newcastle. He excelled at school and in 1939 won a state scholarship to Durham University. His father was a railwayman and to help alleviate poverty at home George turned down this opportunity, preferring to earn an income with the civil service. Throughout the second world war he served with the Signals, working on the tall masts over the Manchester ship canal after the Liverpool blitz, and setting up communications for the decoy &quot;towns&quot; of the Peak District intended to divert bombers from Sheffield. After service in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), he moved to the Colonial Office (CO). Having a broad northern accent he was a bit of an oddity there, his senior colleagues considering him a &quot;rough diamond&quot;. In 1951 he was CO adviser at the UN general assembly, and then financial secretary in Mauritius, reorganising its infrastructure before independence. Appointed OBE on return to the UK, he went to Singapore, Sarawak, North Borneo and each of the Caribbean colonies to advise on arrangements leading to independence. During the 1960s George moved to the Ministry of Health to take charge of the hospital building programme for England and Wales. Headhunted by the architect John Poulson in 1969, he became his general manager, working alongside political associates of the company such as Reginald Maudling. Concerned by the company&apos;s business methods, he returned to what had then become the Department of Health and Social Security in 1971, a year before the scandal of Poulson&apos;s corrupt practices broke. As undersecretary from 1972 to 1981, he oversaw the 1974 reorganisation of the NHS, then became controller at DHSS Central Office at Longbenton in Newcastle in 1980, meanwhile implementing the child benefit allowance scheme, and upgrading the most extensive and complex computer installation in Europe. On retirement, he set up an international hospital development business with Paul James. His work finished in 1992 at the age of 71, after the loss of an eye that had caused him lifelong impaired vision. In the 1980s and 90s he struggled to maintain Clarghyll Hall, north of Alston, in Cumbria, a rambling historic building based around a bastle (a fortified farmhouse), which soon caused great financial worry.

Located in suburban corridors that were only accessible by car, these places put little emphasis on creating communities where people work, live and go out. But now, as the economy emerges from the recession, a shift is occurring where innovation is taking place. Districts of innovation can be found in urban centres as disparate as Montreal, Seoul, Singapore, Medellin, Barcelona, and London. They are popping up in the downtowns and midtowns of cities like Atlanta, Cambridge, Philadelphia, and St. Louis. These are places where advanced research universities, medical complexes, and clusters of tech and creative firms are attracting businesses and residents. Other innovation districts can be found in Boston, Brooklyn, San Francisco, and Seattle, where older industrial areas are being re-imagined and remade, leveraging their enviable location near waterfronts and city centres and along transit lines. Innovative companies and talented workers are flocking to these areas in abundance. Even traditional science parks like Research Triangle Park in Raleigh-Durham are scrambling to urbanise to keep pace with their workers&apos; preference for walkable communities and their companies&apos; desire to be near other firms. In these districts, leading anchor institutions and start-ups are clustering and connecting with one another. They are coming together with spin-off companies, incubators, and accelerators in the relentless pursuit of new discoveries for the market. These areas are small and accessible, growing talent, fostering open collaboration, and offering housing and office space as well as modern urban amenities. They are both competitive places and &quot;cool&quot; spaces. The growth of innovation districts is being driven by private and civic actors like universities, philanthropies, business associations and business improvement districts. Yet local governments play an important role in accelerating the growth of districts and maximising their potential . Three roles stand out: 1) Mayors are leading efforts to designate districts Barcelona&apos;s former mayor Joan Clos set his eyes on transforming his city into a &quot;city of knowledge&quot;. Through extensive, focused public planning and investment, Clos designed an innovation district from the debris of a 494-acre industrial area, which was scarred and separated from the rest of the city by railroad tracks. His vision included burying these tracks, increasing access via a new public tram, designing walkable streets, and creating new public spaces and housing. Today, the area is a 21st-century urban community with 4,500 firms, thousands of new housing units, and clusters of universities, technology centres, and incubators. Across the Atlantic in Boston, former mayor Tom Menino declared the South Boston waterfront an innovation district in 2010. Menino persuaded innovators like MassChallenge to move to the district and exacted important concessions from developers (including land for innovation-oriented retail, shared labs and other spaces, and micro-housing) to help realise the district&apos;s vision. 2) Changing land-use laws to build spaces with a mix of facilities Barcelona and Research Triangle Park, for example, developed bold master plans encouraging the &quot;mixing&quot; of large and small firms, research facilities, housing, restaurants, and retail and outlining where to create open spaces for networking. Cambridge, Massachusetts, by contrast, has allowed incremental moves from rigid, antiquated rules to encourage similar outcomes in Kendall Square . 3) Supporting scarce public resources with large private and civic investments In New York , former mayor Michael Bloomberg deployed $100m in municipal capital to prepare the infrastructure necessary to lure Cornell and Technion universities to Roosevelt Island. In other cities, including St Louis and Seattle, local resources are financing infrastructure improvements to buttress and accelerate private growth. Given that many innovation districts are adjacent to low-income neighbourhoods, cities like Philadelphia are considering smart use of school investments to prepare disadvantaged youth for good jobs in the Stem (science, technology, engineering, and math) economy. As this decade unfolds, we should expect more cities to use their powers in the service of this new model of innovative, inclusive, and resilient growth.

Having bulldozed my way through the city&apos;s hawker markets on a stopover from Australia, my mind is on my next meal. Not the foil-wrapped tray that awaits me, but a proper taste of home. I&apos;ve been away from the UK for 15 months, and in that time been asked what I miss, crave and covet. A greasy spoon fry-up, a bacon sandwich, Sunday lunch or a binge of Monster Munch and the Beeb? It&apos;s like being asked to pick my favourite song. Home is London. It&apos;s Yorkshire and Lancashire, too. All play parts in my life and shape my tastes. Choosing between them is too loaded for me to consider on an empty stomach, so rather than a homecoming meal, I am preparing for a homecoming food journey. London is the first stop and the scene of my last meal all those months ago. Atonement for an airport festive turkey sandwich is on the cards. There is only one place to wipe the slate clean on that breaded abomination: Brixton, a place I&apos;ve missed more than I would have imagined. The lanes of Brixton Village and Market Row, the bustle on Electric Avenue. I&apos;ve tried to explain it to many, but they don&apos;t quite get the appeal. Perhaps it is an experience that has to be had, not explained. Amongst the myriad tastes there is a spot where I&apos;d be divorced pretty sharpish should I not make it the first stop: Rosie&apos;s Deli Cafe, sitting boxed in between tables with a coffee and fancy cheese on toast. Yes, I could have gone for bone marrow at St John or salt marsh lamb at the Canton Arms, but Rosie&apos;s appeal is far beyond comfort food. It is comfort of a different sort. The kind you feel when moving to a city, finding your haunts and defining your village. Biting into a generous cheesy wedge feels like home. The homecoming could stall here on a slice of toast, but must move north. To Yorkshire, and an experience that I&apos;ve tried to replicate in Australia but as yet fallen short. Ingrained in my childhood is my introduction to curry. My dad would take us to Bradford, for dinner (or should that be tea?) at the celebrated likes of the Mumtaz and Aagrah, or somewhere a bit more flock than fancy. I&apos;m imagining a lamb rogan josh, the quintessential Kashmiri dish of my childhood and one that I graduated to from korma training wheels. It all felt very grown up at the time, and an experience that most of my friends didn&apos;t have. It could be anywhere, as long as there is a pile of chapatis and rain beating on the front window. On the bleakest of winter nights, a curry can lift the spirits. In western Australia, where winter days feel like the best of English summers, the rain or bleak chill is the missing ingredient. Last stop, and a short hop over the Pennines to Colne. It is sacrilege for a Yorkshireman to consider Lancashire home, but this mill town is where I find myself drawn. A ritual pint of Burnley&apos;s finest, Moorhouse&apos;s. A Black Cat or Pride of Pendle, drawn from a hand pump; I&apos;ll watch as the glass fills with each pull. My stepdad will know where it&apos;s particularly good, and be sure that I have at least one before trying anything fancy. Every homecoming needs a raised glass, and this is the place and the beer. Whether these departure-lounge daydreams will live up to the food fetishising remains to be seen, as does the question of where home is. Either way, it will be a homecoming that won&apos;t see me go hungry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/ferrovial-buy-aberdeen-glasgow-southampton-airports", "sentences": ["The sovereign wealth funds and pension funds on Heathrow&apos;s board \u2013 Britannia Airport Partners, Singapore&apos;s GIC, Qatar Holding and Alinda Capital Partners \u2013 are believed to be willing to divest the other holdings and focus solely on the UK&apos;s largest airport."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-17T12:44:26Z", "title": "Ferrovial makes bid to buy Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports", "tags": ["Air transport", "World news", "Business", "UK news", "Heathrow airport"], "article": "Ferrovial, the biggest single shareholder in Heathrow, has made a bid to buy Heathrow Airport Holdings&apos; three other British airports outright.

She was a founder member of the Actors&apos; Company and made appearances in diverse productions, from Midsomer Murders to a Harry Potter film. Born and brought up in Hackney, east London, she came from a modest background, and after rudimentary education left school at 15. Her parents ran a semi-professional dramatic company, from which Margery&apos;s acting career developed. Initially she performed in their company at working men&apos;s clubs in the East End of London, starting as principal boy in pantos, then succeeding to adult parts, sometimes competing with her mother for the starring female roles. Her father ran an early cinema, the Hackney Bioscope, and subsequently established the Impartial Film Report, which distributed weekly film reviews to the then many independent cinemas. Margery attended film trade showings, wrote reviews and helped produce the Report. Before the second world war she was active in repertory theatres in Macclesfield, Oldham, and Worthing. In 1943 Ensa (the Entertainments National Service Association) recruited her for tours in Egypt, Palestine and Jordan; then again to India, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. She was an army lieutenant, and claimed to enjoy the luxury of service life. After the war, she returned to repertory acting and wrote her first play, And Use of Kitchen, about London bedsit life. From the 1950s to early 60s she managed theatres, including at Amersham, and later ran her own theatre company in Bangor, Northern Ireland. She was a founder-member of the Actors&apos; Company, before joining the Royal Shakespeare Company for touring and Stratford seasons. Her marriage in 1951 to the classical violinist Peter Daminoff was short-lived. In Talking to a Stranger, John Hopkins&apos; 1966 seminal four-part television drama, Margery co-starred alongside Maurice Denham, Judi Dench and Michael Bryant, and gave an acclaimed performance in the final episode&apos;s central role. Other television work followed in several episodes of Peak Practice, A Family at War and The Bill, with guest appearances in Midsomer Murders, Jonathan Creek, Cadfael and many others. In films she played in The Princess Bride and had cameo parts in Love Actually and Harry Potter and Goblet of Fire. Margery had extraordinary energy and enthusiasm. She loved travel and had been a keen horsewoman and tennis player. Until she was 99 she swam five times a week at the Swiss Cottage baths. She was an autodidact and an idealist, and loved life. She always spoke her mind and relished argument. Politically she was of the old Left, and for many years was a member of the Communist party. She resigned in disgust after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her chief love was theatre and the spoken word: poetry, novels, plays. Her farewell to the stage came in 2003 when, aged 90, she played the nurse in Chekhov&apos;s Three Sisters at the Playhouse theatre, London."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/feb/18/guardian-weekly-21-february-graham-snowdon", "sentences": ["Le Monde reveals how French authorities ignored the extent of a &quot;plague&quot; of Aids-related deaths in the nation&apos;s deprived urban estates and, from the Guardian Cities project, we look at how the cost of living in Singapore is soaring beyond the means of many ordinary residents."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-18T16:26:51Z", "title": "Inside the 21 February edition", "tags": [], "article": "More than 600 days have passed since the siege of Homs began.

And Le Monde takes us on patrol with French troops in the Central African Republic, where an end to sectarian violence seems as distant as ever. There was outrage in India as religious conservatives forced a book on Hinduism to be pulped, while Delhi&apos;s &quot;Common Man&quot; chief minister quit suddenly, seemingly planning a tilt at the forthcoming general election. In Bosnia, economic strife seems to have become a shared cause for still bitterly divided ethnic communities. In Venezuela, street protests against hyper-inflation have led to a government crackdown on a prominent opposition leader. It was a bad week for Scottish nationalists, who came under pressure after a sterling currency union was ruled out by London, and doubts were also cast over whether an independent Scotland would be welcome in the European Union. As Britain mops up after recent heavy flooding and the US shivers in more icy conditions, the leading environmental scientist Nicholas Stern argues on our Comment pages that the effects of climate change he forewarned the British government of in 2006 have well and truly arrived. The Weekly Review opens with a fascinating first-person account by the author Barbara Taylor of life inside a 1980s British mental asylum. Le Monde reveals how French authorities ignored the extent of a &quot;plague&quot; of Aids-related deaths in the nation&apos;s deprived urban estates and, from the Guardian Cities project, we look at how the cost of living in Singapore is soaring beyond the means of many ordinary residents. Discovery asks why ancient life forms can come to be encased so perfectly in amber, Books lays bare the true cost to society of cheap meat production, and Culture meets the actor Kristin Scott Thomas. Notes &amp; Queries asks why fortune tellers don&apos;t win the lottery more often (I&apos;ve often wondered this myself), while Good to Meet You features a reader who paid a short visit to Malawi and ended up staying rather longer than he&apos;d imagined. Finally, Sport reports from the Sochi Olympics, where slushy snow conditions have made life hard for competitors. More evidence of climate change? Then again, perhaps it&apos;s just wiser not to hold the Winter Games in a city where the streets are lined with palm trees \u2026 We hope you enjoy the edition.

Signs placed above the breakfast fry-up station warn against asking for an egg sunny side up: it&apos;s available over-easy only. The reason, as explained by patient cooks to bemused visitors, is that diseases might lurk in a runny yolk. Feeding soldiers in a warzone is one of the biggest challenges for any army. Generals want to keep their soldiers healthy, and food done well, both in the &quot;d-facs&quot; (dining faciliites) and MREs (&quot;meals ready to eat&quot;, in US army speak \u2013 or &quot;ration packs&quot;) can be a morale booster, a reminder of home in a hostile, alien place. So for soldiers on the ground, one of the most important recent breakthroughs in military technology may be the &quot;three-year pizza&quot;, described by its scientist creators as the &quot;holy grail&quot; of ration-pack food. Pizza is the most asked-for dish when troops are quizzed on what they would like to see in their supplies, but it has taken years of research to come up with a slice that tastes like the real thing, yet can sit on the shelf without the tomato sauce turning the crust soggy or mould growing on the cheese. The US and other militaries have poured billions into these technologically impressive ration packs. Few commanding officers forget Napoleon Bonaparte&apos;s apocryphal remark &quot;an army marches on its stomach&quot;, so ration packs have already come a long way from the cans of corned beef that one officer confided were so hated by British soldiers, that on training exercises, they threw them over a cliff, preferring hunger. Scientists and chefs have worked for years to produce tasty food that lasts for months in a sealed pouch or tin. We decided to test how palatable the newer ration packs are, and begged a meal from the many countries with soldiers in Kabul for a charity dinner in aid of schools in Afghanistan. The meals were rated by a collection of diplomats, officials, aid workers and security contractors from around the world, each paying for the privilege. The Estonian ambassador returned to Kabul with an overweight suitcase full of smoked sprats, stuffed peppers and halva. Only the Americans declined to contribute. They were legally forbidden from giving away their ration packs, embassy and military officials said apologetically, and no one was willing to risk bending the rules. Fortunately, supplies trucked in through Pakistan often vanish in transit, and US packs are for sale at $2 each in the &quot;Bush bazaar&quot;. On the night, diners chose between food from 11 countries, from Denmark to Spain to Singapore. Most popular was the Italian pack: diners were undoubtedly lured in by the country&apos;s culinary reputation, and the surprise addition of a splash of grappa \u2013 the only alcohol on offer. Second were the French, who once included a carton of red wine, but now serve only dry rations. One surprise was the German pack \u2013 the meal people were most reluctant to try, but a runaway success thanks to the liver sausage spread and rye bread. Still, most of the diners weren&apos;t moved to renounce conventional cooking. When asked to rate the meal, one wrote, &quot;1 on a scale of 1 to 1,000&quot;. The best bit about the meal, he added, was &quot;that I did not have to eat it&quot;. Another added, &quot;now I know how it will feel on Mars&quot;. But not everyone went home hungry and disappointed. &quot;Tasteful but impractical in wartime,&quot; said one woman after polishing off, of course, a French meal. \u2022 The Kabul dinner was a charity event to raise funds for two different types of school. School of Leadership, Afghanistan, aims to train a new generation of leaders for a country that lost most of its educated elite to decades of war. The Afghan Schools Trust has built basic schoolhouses in the poorest and often conservative rural areas; some of their graduates, children of illiterate parents, are now studying in India and Italy. Italy     Italian Army ration pack. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    The Italian ration pack contains a breakfast shot of 40% alcohol cordiale, a powdered cappuccino, lots of biscotti, and a disposable camping stove for heating parts of the meal, including a pasta and bean soup, canned turkey and a rice salad. Dessert is a power sport bar, canned fruit salad or a muesli chocolate bar. France     French Army ration pack.

The main courses include the British favourite, chicken tikka masala, and a vegetarian pasta. There&apos;s also pork and beans for breakfast, and lots of sweets and snacks from trail mix to an apple &quot;fruit pocket&quot; that looks like it might not be out of place in a school lunchbox. Plus packets of Polos and, of course, plenty of teabags. Australia     Australian Army ration pack.

Most of it is packaged by the military, from a serving of love-it-or-hate-it Vegemite to jam sandwich biscuits and a tube of sweetened condensed milk. The bag includes a can-opener-cum-spoon for getting at the Fonterra processed cheddar cheese, and main meals of meatballs and chilli tuna pasta. There are lots of sweets and soft drinks, and two unappetising-looking bars labelled &quot;chocolate ration&quot;. Spain     Spanish ration pack Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    The Spanish lunch pack has cans of green beans with ham, squid in vegetable oil, and pate. There is also a sachet of powdered vegetable soup, peach in syrup for dessert and crackers handed out to go with the meal in place of bread (not shown). There is a disposable heater with matches and fuel tabs, as well as lots of tablets: Vitamin C, glucose, water purification, and rehydration. US     US Army ration pack. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Almond poppy seed pound cake, cranberries, spiced apple cider (the hot US non-alcoholic drink) and peanut butter and crackers make up this very American meal package. The main \u2013 pasta with vegetable &quot;crumbles&quot; in spicy tomato sauce \u2013 is less traditional, but the &quot;flameless heater&quot; shows off American tech skills \u2013 just add water to the powder in a plastic bag and it heats up enough to warm the plastic meal pouch. Canada     Following photographs: David Levene for the Guardian    While there are Bear Paws snacks in the Canadian ration pack, there&apos;s the shocking omission of maple syrup.

As Vanessa Vanakorn, she was somewhat less distinguished on Tuesday, finishing in 67th place out of 67 finishers in the women&apos;s giant slalom. But Mae, who used the surname of her Thai father to fulfil her dream to compete at the Winter Olympics under the flag of Thailand, celebrated almost as much as those who made the medal podium after successfully navigating her way to the end of the course on both of her runs. Weather conditions were appalling on the mountains above Sochi, with low-hanging cloud, fog and driving rain, and even the most experienced hands said the course was incredibly hard to ski due to the soft snow and condensation on goggles. After finishing her first run with arms aloft \u2013 she was 74th out of 74 at that point \u2013 Mae said: &quot;It was cool. I think it&apos;s hard to stay focused when you only have six months training like me, but I was just happy I didn&apos;t get lost, because this was my first two-gates and I thought I was going to go the wrong side, but I made it down.&quot; The German favourite Maria Hoefl-Riesch, who won the event at the Vancouver Games four years ago and won gold in the super-combined in Sochi, was amused by Mae&apos;s physique before the race. &quot;She&apos;s so small and fragile, you can&apos;t imagine how she can finish a run like that or even hit a gate,&quot; said Hoefl-Riesch, who had to pull out with a sore throat and did not compete. Some of the other skiers seemed starstruck by Mae&apos;s presence in their field. Germany&apos;s Barbara Wirth, who spent time training with Mae in the runup to the race, and who finished 25th, said: &quot;It was a nice experience. She was really excited to be training with us, but we were equally as excited because she&apos;s such a big music star. She is extremely ambitious and works really hard, and we were impressed with how well she was skiing, despite the little amount of practice she&apos;s had.&quot; Mae, who grew up in Singapore and London, is one half of a two-person Thai team at Sochi, and only the third person to represent the country at a Winter Olympics. She got into the event by the skin of her teeth after competing in a number of qualifying events over the past months. &quot;You&apos;ve got the elite skiers of the world and then you&apos;ve got some mad old woman like me trying to make it down,&quot; she said. &quot;I think it&apos;s great the Olympics is here, it gives you the chance to try something new later in life. If you do everything when you&apos;re young, you leave no fun until the end. I was lucky that the Olympics, you know, allow exotic nations, for people like me who have day jobs.&quot; The gold medal went to Slovenia&apos;s Tina Maze, who had already won one gold in a dead-heat finish in the women&apos;s downhill. Anna Fenninger of Austria took silver, 0.07 seconds behind. The top five finishers were separated by half a second over the two runs, while Mae finished a full 50 seconds behind. Nevertheless, her cautious approach in the poor conditions paid off: 22 of the 89 starters crashed out on either their first or second run. Before the Games, Mae had spoken about how her passion for skiing caused a rift with her mother, who was the driving force behind her violin career and was terrified of anything that could threaten her daughter&apos;s ability to play. Mae was determined that despite the potential for injuries, her desire to ski was more important. &quot;You can insure yourself up to your eyeballs, but if you don&apos;t take risks, what&apos;s the point? You have to enjoy life,&quot; she said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/18/maths-more-pointless-than-latin-british-pupils-china", "sentences": ["The other top maths countries were also de facto city states, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, shorn of their poorer hinterlands."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-18T20:42:51Z", "title": "For Britain's pupils, maths is even more pointless than Latin | Simon Jenkins", "tags": ["Mathematics", "Education policy", "China", "Education", "UK news", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Politics", "Mathematics", "Science"], "article": "There are lies, damned lies and statistics, but worse still are maths statistics. They send people mad. Elizabeth Truss, the education minister, sets off next week to see why Chinese pupils are so good at maths: indeed, why even working-class Chinese pupils are better than middle-class British ones. She and her boss, Michael Gove, believe the future of the British economy rests on her findings. Truss&apos;s trip, with loyal headteachers in tow, makes The Hunting of the Snark look like sanity. David Cameron and his colleagues are infatuated with anything to do with China. Now it is education. It so happens that in 2010 researchers from the London Institute of Education reported that Chinese school performance had nothing to do with China. Even in Britain, &quot;Chinese pupils from families in routine and manual jobs perform better than white pupils from managerial and professional backgrounds.&quot; It is maths that has the mesmeric appeal. To Gove and Truss it is virtually a state religion. Captains of industry, titans of science, politicians of all parties, they all take up the cry, declaring maths to hold the secret of the universe. Stuff the little blighters full of maths, they demand, and Britain will again rule the world. Square the hypotenuse, and Johnny Taliban will beg for mercy. The appeal of school maths to control-minded politicians is obvious: it is easy to test, and thus to measure, unlike vague, slippery humanities. British governments, gripped in the vice of targets, crave quantification. They have thus made what is measurable important, rather than what is important measurable. They are Gradgrind&apos;s useful idiots. How else could they credit the OECD&apos;s rubbishy but much publicised Pisa tables, which put China &quot;top&quot; in maths in 2012? For a start, the Chinese figures are not for China at all, but just booming Shanghai. The other top maths countries were also de facto city states, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, shorn of their poorer hinterlands. Truss might as well compare rural China with the cities of London and Westminster. These global surveys are notoriously unreliable. Barely 15% separates the top 25 Pisa states, meaning that sampling discrepancies can move countries wildly up and down. The Cambridge statistician David Spiegelhalter is splendidly dismissive: &quot;The imputation of plausible values, based on an over-simplistic model and assuming the &apos;difficulties&apos; are fixed known quantities, will underestimate, to an unknown extent, the appropriate uncertainty in the scores and rankings.&quot; I could not put it better. The maths cult is relentless. The Institute for Fiscal Studies claims that maths achievers &quot;earn 7% more at 30&quot; than others. It does not ask if people who earn more just happen to have been good at maths. Truss too is obsessed. Shortly before the crash in 2008, she wrote that Britain&apos;s &quot;world-class mathematicians have aided its ascension as one of the financial capitals of the world&quot;. They had elevated British financiers from mere bank lenders to &quot;masters of the universe&quot; through their brilliant derivatives modelling and trading. We needed more of them, she pleaded. In that case, I assume it was being too good at maths that cost Britain the worst recession and the deepest misery since the second world war. I learned maths. I found it tough and enjoyable. Algebra, trigonometry, differential calculus, logarithms and primes held no mystery, but they were even more pointless than Latin and Greek. Only a handful of my contemporaries went on to use maths afterwards. Our teacher told us it was for &quot;mind training&quot;, the last cry of the desperate pedagogue. Hence my delight on reading the words of the great mathematician GH Hardy, that his subject &quot;must be justified as art if it can be justified at all&quot;. I know of no proof of a causal link between maths and national success or happiness. The fact that countries that do badly in Pisa league tables, such as America, Britain and Germany, are neither poor nor specially wretched ought to make statisticians at least pause. Of course children need to be taught the rudiments of number, proportion and probability, as they do to read and write. But there are few occupations that need maths at the level I studied, and they can learn it as a language skill. I firmly believe all the maths most people use can be found in John Allen Paulos&apos;s short classic, Innumeracy. It damns alike those who boast &quot;I was never any good at maths&quot;, and those who teach it so badly that millions loathe it. Government manpower planning rarely works. Margaret Thatcher&apos;s government declared that Britain needed more mathematicians and scientists. Universities were starved of money for arts and given double grants for science. Teacher salaries were loaded against humanities. John Major and Tony Blair took up the cry. The BBC went on to broadcast hours of Brian Cox and friends, showing science with a sense of humour, cool clothes and better sex. It was a total failure. Young people voted with their feet for the arts \u2013 while the economy boomed. If British schools are to be slaves to Gove&apos;s economic dogma, they should be turning out accountants, lawyers, administrators and salespeople. That is where the money is. Britain needs literate and presentable young people, sensitive to culture and the world around them, skilled in health, entertainment, finance, the law and citizenship. The truth is that Gove, like most of Cameron&apos;s ministers, is an old socialist planner at heart. Nobody has a clue what ought to be taught in schools. Britain&apos;s curriculum, like its teaching methods and school year, is stuck in Tom Brown&apos;s Schooldays. Confused education ministers default to &quot;What was good enough for me is good enough for them&quot;. We should all go back to rote. I once visited Chinese schools; they were like communist drill halls, factories of pressure, discipline and childhood misery. The ultimate ambition for China&apos;s top mathematicians is to flee to America&apos;s Silicon Valley, where I gather they are packing their children into progressive Steiner Waldorf schools \u2013 as far from Gove&apos;s dirigisme as could be imagined. The wisest comment on all this comes from South Korea&apos;s former education minister, Prof JuHo Lee. Looking at the highest youth suicide rate in the world, he declares that &quot;test scores may be important in the age of industrialisation&quot;, but that was over. Schools should turn their attention to &quot;creativity and social and emotional capacities&quot;. Britain is out of date. The maths lobby&apos;s bluff should be called. That is the message for Truss to bring back from the east."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/feb/19/william-larman-obituary", "sentences": ["In 1945 he was sent with the severely depleted 1st Airborne Division to recapture Singapore from Japanese forces, but the war ended as he was en route.", "On arrival he was instead put in charge of repatriating Japanese soldiers via the railway from Singapore to Siam (Thailand)."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-19T13:36:08Z", "title": "William Larman obituary", "tags": ["Second world war", "Peterborough"], "article": "My grandfather William &quot;Gaffer&quot; Larman, who has died aged 89, led a full life and was variously a paratrooper, employment law specialist and organic food pioneer. Born to Ernest and Maud Larman in Peterborough, the youngest of six children, he was a practical joker who was famous as a young man for having flown his underwear from the town hall. He was also a keen sportsman with several boxing trophies to his name and an outdoorsman who worked his way up to King&apos;s Scout. William&apos;s knack for bushcraft was to serve him well in the second world war. After a stint with the Home Guard, things took a more professional turn when, at 17, he enlisted with the Northamptonshire Regiment, soon transferring to the Royal Signals and then the newly formed Paratroop Regiment at RAF Ringway in Cheshire in 1943. Working his way up the ranks of the Red Devils, William served across North Africa, Sicily, mainland Italy and finally at the ill-fated battle of Arnhem in 1944, where he took part in the final defence of divisional HQ alongside Major General Roy Urquhart and became one of the lucky few to escape across the Rhine. In 1945 he was sent with the severely depleted 1st Airborne Division to recapture Singapore from Japanese forces, but the war ended as he was en route. On arrival he was instead put in charge of repatriating Japanese soldiers via the railway from Singapore to Siam (Thailand). He retired from the army with the rank of captain in 1946. William married a Londoner, Iris Rice, in 1951 and they moved to Malaya, where he worked for the electricity board; their daughter Jane was born in Kuala Lumpur, and on their return to Britain their son, Hugo, was born. The marriage ended in divorce. William eventually became chief personnel manager for the British Ever Ready Electrical Company and was heavily involved in turbulent union negotiations there throughout the 1970s, using his experiences of those challenging times to write a book on health and safety law. He also wrote several unpublished works, including a history of the Monmouth rebellion, and became a regular contributor to Organic Gardening magazine. In the 1980s William opened an organic wholefood shop in Hatfield with his new partner, Fleur Hargrave.

The properties will go on sale on 1 May and buyers can register their interest online. However, the company behind the renovation said the 254 apartments, ranging from studios to five-bedroom penthouses, would be marketed only in the UK. &quot;This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own one of a relatively small number of fantastic homes being created in the iconic Power Station itself,&quot; said Rob Tincknell, chief executive officer of Battersea Power Station Development Company. &quot;There has been a lot of comment recently about London&apos;s housing problems, and we believe the only way to try and solve this is to build great homes and create a community that people actually want to live in. &quot;We are proud to be launching these new homes in London only, and this decision is part of a wider strategy to create a product well-suited for owner-occupiers and people who will help us create a real and lasting community here in Battersea.&quot; London&apos;s rapidly increasing house prices have been blamed on foreign investors looking to the UK as a safe haven for their cash, and in some cases leaving properties empty while would-be buyers struggle to afford to buy. Developers have been keen to tap into investors&apos; interest, marketing homes at property shows in the likes of Singapore and Hong Kong before they are offered to UK buyers. The siutuation has caused increasing political unease, and on Monday the Labour leader Ed Miliband vowed that if his party came to power it would prevent developers advertising properties overseas first. It is understood that overseas purchasers who register their interest online in the power station properties will have to attend a sales appointment in London in order to buy. Darren Johnson, the Green party member of the London Assembly who has been calling for developers to prioritise local buyers, said: &quot;The key thing is whether Londoners bother turning up at the viewing when they see the prices for these flats. Property prices and rents are accelerating away from incomes at a rapid rate and increasing numbers of Londoners are being left out in the cold. London&apos;s housing market is an investment driven bubble. &quot;Whether the investors are domestic, or foreign, the key thing is that they are inflating prices.

King announced last month that he would step down as head of Sainsbury&apos;s in July after a decade in the post. It fuelled speculation that he could replace Ecclestone, who is 83 and stood down from the board of F1 in January after being told that he faces bribery charges in Germany. King is known to be a motor racing fan and his son Jordan is a professional driver. Last year Jordan won British Formula 3, a junior series which is two steps below F1. Speaking for the first time since King announced his resignation, Ecclestone says there is &quot;no truth at all&quot; to the rumour that he will be taking over F1&apos;s driving seat. Asked what the Sainsbury&apos;s boss knows about running a motorsport series, Ecclestone said: &quot;All he knows about is looking for support for his kids.&quot; It is a reference to a controversy in 2012 when it came to light that five brands with business ties to Sainsbury&apos;s sponsor his son&apos;s racing career. Sainsbury&apos;s said that its board had approved the arrangements and that there was &quot;no conflict of interest&quot; because King had no direct involvement with the brands&apos; commercial relationships. Mr King&apos;s interest in racing has also driven talk about him taking over as chief executive of the McLaren F1 team. He is a close friend of its chairman Ron Dennis and the two go on shooting trips together. Dennis recently created the chief executive post but a spokesperson for McLaren said it was &quot;untrue&quot; that King would fill the role. This month King was asked by London radio station LBC whether he would be interested in a role in motor racing. He replied: &quot;I&apos;m more focused on my son&apos;s ambitions to get to Formula One \u2013 it would make me very proud and I&apos;d get a lot of pleasure if he achieved that.&quot; A spokesperson for Mr King declined to comment further. Speaking last month in the wake of his resignation announcement, 52-year old King said he still had &quot;plenty more in the tank&quot; for another big job, but added that he had not been talking to other organisations. A non-compete clause in his contract means he cannot work for another supermarket, or former employer Marks &amp; Spencer, until at least July 2015. King is also an elder statesman of the business world, as senior figure at the CBI and a former member of David Cameron&apos;s business advisory group. Ecclestone has not groomed a successor despite facing possible threats to his position. In April he is due to be put on trial in Munich for allegedly paying part of a $44m (\u00a326.3m) bribe to steer the sale of F1 to the private equity firm CVC in 2006. He denies the charges against him and although the German legal system allows the case to be settled by making a financial payment, he insists that he &quot;wants to be there to clear his name. I bet it is going to happen.&quot; Despite stepping down from the F1 board, Mr Ecclestone continues to run F1 on a day-to-day basis and CVC has given him its full support. The only sign of succession planning so far has been its hiring of head hunting firm Egon Zehnder as part of the stalled plan to float F1 on the Singapore stock exchange in 2012. Egon Zehnder drafted a confidential shortlist of potential replacements for Ecclestone, which reportedly includes Premier League boss Richard Scudamore. However no one has been engaged. Ecclestone says he is already looking to his next challenge which is to deal with the Olden, his 16-room hotel in the Swiss ski resort of Gstaad. He recently bought out his business partner, former Ferrari team boss Marco Piccinini, and he is understood to have spent the past few days at the hotel. &quot;I&apos;m going to try to sort my hotel out,&quot; says Mr Ecclestone &quot;I have bought the other people out so I have now got the aggravation from that too.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/19/robert-mugabe-birthday-plans-condemned-zimbabwe-struggles", "sentences": ["Mugabe, who continues to defy the march of time and constant health speculation, travelled to Singapore this week for cataract surgery on his left eye, according to his spokesman.", "The president regularly travels to Singapore for medical check-ups and, some believe, a mysterious treatment involving blood transfusions."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-19T17:55:04Z", "title": "Robert Mugabe's lavish 90th birthday plans decried as Zimbabwe struggles", "tags": ["Robert Mugabe", "Zimbabwe", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "  Plans for a lavish $1m (\u00a3600,000) celebration of Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe&apos;s 90th birthday have been condemned as the country lurches towards another financial crisis. The tribute to Africa&apos;s oldest head of state \u2013 and second oldest in the world after Israel&apos;s Shimon Peres \u2013 is expected to surpass last year&apos;s party, when special gold coins were minted and Mugabe was presented with a cake said to weigh 89kg. But the costly event will come amid heavy job losses, slowing economic growth and what the central bank describes as a &quot;severe and persistent liquidity crunch&quot;, reviving memories of the disastrous meltdown five years ago. Mugabe, who continues to defy the march of time and constant health speculation, travelled to Singapore this week for cataract surgery on his left eye, according to his spokesman. But he is expected back in time for the birthday celebration with thousands of supporters at the Rudhaka stadium in the town of Marondera on Sunday, two days after he turns 90. Absalom Sikhosana, secretary for youth affairs in Mugabe&apos;s Zanu-PF party, told reporters recently: &quot;This is a very special celebration. Turning 90 is no mean feat. You cannot turn 90 years when you are a womaniser, a drunkard or a chain smoker. We will be celebrating the life of a very special person on a very special occasion.&quot; It is a milestone in the history of the country, which has known no other leader since gaining independence from Britain in 1980, but activists and opposition politicians described the event as an extravagant waste of money when many citizens are going hungry. &quot;It would be inappropriate for a country&apos;s head of state to have such a lavish and costly celebration at a time when the country is faced with the disaster of flooding and a crumbling economy,&quot; said Dewa Mavhinga, a Zimbabwe researcher at Human Rights Watch. &quot;It&apos;s about cultism, hero worship, institutionalising Mugabe, with sycophants around him trying to oil the wheels of patronage. There&apos;s an entire system behind this corruption.&quot; Reflecting on Mugabe&apos;s 34 years in power, Mavhinga added: &quot;His human rights record is one that no one can honestly admire. There is nothing to celebrate about his birthday or his legacy \u2013 and there are concerns that, if something should happen to him, the country might be plunged into chaos if there is no clear mechanism for transition.&quot; Officially, funds for the birthday bash are being raised by the Zanu-PF youth league and not from the public purse. But Tendai Biti, who was finance minister until his party lost heavily to Zanu-PF in disputed elections last year, said: &quot;When I was finance minister we never contributed a cent, but I&apos;ve absolutely no doubt that they will get money from the treasury this time.&quot; As the economy stumbles back into trouble, long queues are returning to bank branches and companies are laying off aroundabout 300 people a week, according to trade unions. Biti said: &quot;The economy is going down and we need to do something about it. The government is clueless and has no idea how to manage it. Things are getting worse every day.&quot; David Coltart, the former education minister, noted that the economy was in far worse shape during the hyperinflation of 2008 but Mugabe&apos;s supporters organised birthday celebrations even then. &quot;Some people will be appalled by it but they don&apos;t seem bothered,&quot; he said. The president regularly travels to Singapore for medical check-ups and, some believe, a mysterious treatment involving blood transfusions. A US diplomatic cable from 2008, leaked three years later by WikiLeaks, quoted Mugabe&apos;s close ally and former central bank chief Gideon Gono as telling former US ambassador Christopher Dell that Mugabe had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The far east became the destination of choice for Mugabe&apos;s medical care after the European Union imposed sanctions on him in 2002. On Monday the EU said it had lifted a visa ban and assets freeze against members of Zimbabwe&apos;s ruling elite with the exception of Mugabe and his wife, Grace. If he serves his full term, Mugabe will be 94 when the next elections are due. At the funeral of his sister Bridget last month, he spoke for more than an hour and mused: &quot;I do not know how I have lived this long. It is all in God&apos;s hands.&quot; &quot;I do respect that he&apos;s reached 90 years,&quot; Coltart said. &quot;I was constantly amazed in cabinet by his vigour; he was not a doddery, senile man. Against that, the country remains in crisis and the economy is in turmoil. That needs an energetic pair of hands to deal with.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/feb/19/corrections-and-clarifications", "sentences": ["\u2022 Singaporean soldiers&apos; rations are not quite as meagre as we suggested in an article examining the military fare of 11 nations."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-19T20:59:01Z", "title": "Corrections and clarifications", "tags": [], "article": "\u2022 A story about the organisation that advises the government on teachers&apos; pay and conditions stated, because of an editing error, that it &quot;agreed with Michael Gove, the education secretary, that teachers should still have to undertake 21 tasks including filing, taking formal minutes at meetings, and\u00a0investigating student absence&quot;.

It\u2019s a prediction many are making after the team\u2019s performances at the ANZ pre-season tournament. Throw in new recruits Caitlin Thwaites, Sharni Layton and Gretel Tippett, and the Swifts are one of five teams capable of taking the crown this year.   The Swifts have many reasons to push themselves this year, not least their rather ordinary performance last season. The trouble began for the Swifts when a well-intended, but poorly executed succession plan went awry in 2011.  Long-time coach Julie Fitzgerald was subjected to an \u201cinternal review\u201d by Netball NSW and her contract was not renewed. Instead management hired a former Diamonds\u2019 player, Lisa Beehag.  Beehag seemed the natural successor; she had served a long apprenticeship with experience coaching the AIS, Singapore, various NSW and ACT state teams, and as a Diamonds assistant coach. But the former wing-defence\u2019s first call was a daring and unpopular decision, telling team stalwart Catherine Cox she would no longer be captain.  Cox had skippered the side since 2008, guiding the team to a premiership and two finals campaigns but she found out about the planned demotion only after she had called her new coach for a pre-season chat. Cox noted Beehag had been cool to her on the phone and when she rang back to ask why, she was told there were plans to change the Swifts\u2019 attacking line. Cox would no longer be captain. A furious Cox resigned, went public with her rage and moved to the West Coast Fever. Cox later alleged that Beehag not only told her she did not want to her to be captain, but told her she did not \u201crequire\u201d her in the Swifts team at all. The general consensus is that while the top netball team in NSW needed to freshen up their on- and off-court play, the saga worked against the Swifts. Indeed, the problem for Beehag and Netball NSW played out in four parts. 1) Netball NSW\u2019s review of Fitzgerald\u2019s coaching job was conducted during the season. Cox and Liz Ellis publicly criticised Netball NSW for distracting players with this review \u2013 there were even some suggestions it was to blame for the Swifts\u2019 minor semi-final upset loss. From the outset, it looked as though Beehag\u2019s crown came with a more than a few thorns.  2) Cox had no warning of Beehag\u2019s decision. Cox was angry and vented her spleen in the media \u2013 this spelled P-R M-E-S-S. Diamonds defender Rebecca Bulley followed Cox out the door, as did Courtney Tairi. Crucially, a number of young, upcoming NSW players (Brazil, Simmons, Simpson and Ravallion) and future Australian squad members took up contracts in Brisbane and Perth, where they remain. 3) Beehag and Netball NSW did not recruit anyone to replace Cox (or Bulley for that matter). This left a couple of gaping holes in the line-up. To make matters worse, Beehag made frequent and often ill-timed substitutions during matches, exposing the lack of talent on the Swifts bench. 4) Fitzgerald\u2019s and Cox\u2019s departures also severed the team from its traditions. While the Swifts are now a slick, well-funded franchise, their origins lie in grassroots suburban netball in the state\u2019s northern suburbs. The NSW Swifts were originally the Sydney Swifts, which was in turn based on the Ku-ring-gai state league side (an association made up of about a dozen suburban netball clubs) \u2013 a team coached by Fitzgerald and in which Cox had played alongside Ellis since 1996. Arguably, the team lost a bit of their soul when Fitzgerald and Cox left in the way they did. Under Fitzgerald, the Swifts had failed to make the finals just once between 1997 and 2011. The side had picked up a swag of premierships. Under Beehag\u2019s two year reign, the team failed to make the finals. In 2013, the Swifts finished a dismal eighth, losing 71-51 to Cox\u2019s new side along the way. At the end of 2013 Beehag\u2019s contract was not renewed.  It was humiliating all around. Beehag\u2019s reign as coach of an ANZ team had come to an end, while Netball NSW\u2019s mishandling of generational change was self-evident. Guardian Australia asked Netball NSW whether they knew of Beehag\u2019s plans for Cox before hiring her and whether they felt the process had been handled in the best possible way for the Swifts. The body was also asked why Fitzgerald had been let go and if, in retrospect, it had been a good idea to hire Beehag.  The questions were not answered directly, instead the response was \u201cthe focus of Netball NSW is on the 2014 season. We are excited about the NSW Swifts\u2019 playing roster and coaching panel we have recruited for the 2014 ANZ Championship and are looking forward to getting the new season underway\u201d. Looking forward might be the only way to go after the Swifts\u2019 last two years. But this makes the job of new coach Rob Wright, the first man to hold a head coach role of an ANZ team, all the more tricky. A native NSW coach who has risen steadily through the ranks, he will be in charge of one of the most exciting rosters in the 2014 season.  \u201cIt is well-known that we were the lowest scoring team in the competition last year and hence why we have recruited both Caitlin [Thwaites] and Gretel [Tippett],\u201d Wright told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe have been working on a number of combinations and we are confident that any of the four [shooters] will be more than capable of getting the job done on court.\u201d  Wright will be assisted by his long-time friend Anita Keelan, along with specialist midcourt, defence and shooting coaches. Wright and the NSW netball establishment have much to prove this year and the indications thus far are that this time they may have got it right. \u2022 The Swifts open their ANZ championship campaign against the Fever on Sunday 2 March at the State Sports Centre in Sydney.

Despite some recent disappointing economic data from China and the US, investors are accentuating the positive, including Thursday&apos;s more upbeat American manufacturing survey, with the leading index currently up 32.13 points at 6845.12. This is around 100 points shy of its record intra-day high. The current chaos in the Ukraine seems to be having little effect so far on market sentiment. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said:  This week we&apos;ve had very little comfort on the economic data front with Chinese and US data disappointing across several fronts. The latest [US Federal Reserve] minutes haven&apos;t done anything to suggest that the Fed seems perturbed about the recent weakness in economic data thus far, and yet we are still seeing evidence of irrational exuberance amongst some in the market, in an effort to make their money work for them as markets continue to look to retest their recent highs.  How else can the decision by Facebook to pay $19bn for WhatsApp be otherwise described, when just under a year ago it was being touted about for $1bn?  Recent policymaker statements have reinforced the belief that we will see another $10bn shaved off the monthly total of Fed asset purchases in four weeks&apos; time which you would have thought would mean that investors might finally need to be more discerning about where they put their money. Currently that doesn&apos;t appear to be the case with European markets [following] last night&apos;s US lead .   Vodafone is up 5.35p at 234.95p as UBS issued a buy note and raised its target price from 260p to 275p. This comes a day after Citigroup set a target price of 290p on the mobile phone group. Analysts believe the cash and share distribution from Vodafone - which followed the $130bn disposal of its share in US joint venture Verizon Wireless - could keep the market buoyant as the proceeds are reinvested in other FTSE 100 companies. Elsewhere Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 5.3p to 361p ahead of next week&apos;s results as the market, in typical fashion, welcomed reports of 30,000 job cuts. Analyst Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:  Reports indicate that the bank could cut a further 20,000 to 30,000 jobs (up to a quarter of its workforce), while further shrinking its Investment Banking operations and exiting overseas businesses (e.g. Asia). This would enable the company to become much more focused on the UK retail, business and corporate banking segments, while also allowing for significant cost cuts and re-investment in new technology. Such a strategy is likely to result in a smaller but more efficient, higher return and less risky bank, we believe.   Arm has added 15p to 962p as technology shares continued to the lifted by the aforementioned Facebook deal. It was also helped by an outperform rating from Credit Suisse. But InterContinental Hotels has fallen 40p to \u00a319.35 as Credit Suisse moved from neutral to underperform after a trading update earlier in the week disappointed investors. Many had been hoping for news of a cash payout following the group&apos;s disposal programme, but there was no update. Still with the sector, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels has climbed 25p to 596.5p after a 54% rise in full year profits to \u00a3263.6m, albeit flattered by a \u00a3139m contribution from the one-off sale of 147 condominiums in Singapore.

It was the brainchild of Singapore&apos;s first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. When he swept to power in 1959, Cambridge-educated Lee rejected calls to patch up the densely packed slums and demanded a fresh start. In his garden city, modelled on the 19th-century ideals of Letchworth Garden City, plants were central. Five decades later, with one of the world&apos;s highest per capita incomes and percentages of resident millionaires, the gamble on gardening has paid off. This Victorian view of landscaping as crucial to draw in the crowds (and\u00a0their money) is in stark contrast to the UK today, where landscaping is often sidelined as a\u00a0drain on project resources. The 21st century brought a\u00a0shift in\u00a0vision for Singapore&apos;s town planning: it was no longer to be a\u00a0garden city, but a city in a garden. Horticulture became part of standard planning laws, with developers of skyscrapers obliged to\u00a0shroud large sections of their buildings in living walls and to top\u00a0them with public-access &quot;sky\u00a0parks&quot;. Lifted from ideas pioneered by British designers in London and New York nearly three-quarters of\u00a0a\u00a0century earlier, including the Kensington Roof Gardens, these are\u00a0re-envisioned pleasure gardens. Key\u00a0among them is the iconic Marina Bay Sands resort, three glittering towers set aloft an enormous park on a platform. Mature palms shade deck chairs that\u00a0overlook an infinity pool, which appears to spill over the building&apos;s edge. An architectural ha-ha, an idea first employed on Britain&apos;s country estates, prevents water cascading on\u00a0to the traffic below. Across town at the Park Royal on\u00a0Pickering hotel, a multistorey rainforest clings to the side of a glass building suspended high above the street. Palms, plumerias and tree ferns shade the interior of the building, keeping it cool, and curtains of jungle climbers drape down to connect the gardens on each floor.

The $1bn Gardens by the Bay contains dozens of themed gardens, many designed by British architects. In true Victorian fashion,\u00a0the 101-hectare park is centred on two conservatories \u2013 albeit with the interiors chilled to mimic Mediterranean and cloud forest habitats. The Flower Dome, the world&apos;s largest columnless greenhouse, houses an olive grove, a\u00a0recreation of the South African fynbos, Australian outback and an elevated baobab garden. In the Cloud Forest Dome, lifts transport visitors 140ft up the central hollow of a &quot;cloud mountain&quot; to suspended walkways over treetops. Even Singapore&apos;s Changi airport houses six indoor and outdoor gardens, which are managed using skills picked up from Chelsea Flower show \u2013 plants are whipped out the second their blooms fade in the air conditioning and replaced from a\u00a0nursery sited along the runway. Singapore&apos;s glossy, thematic approach to horticulture may seem theatrical and gimmicky, but in many ways it is more faithful to the\u00a0pioneering spirit\u00a0of the British Victorian gardeners we often try to\u00a0emulate than our own obsession for rehashing the\u00a0past."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/feb/21/vodafone-ftse-100-highest-since-may", "sentences": ["Still with the sector, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels climbed 17.5p to 589p after a 54% rise in full year profits to \u00a3263.6m, albeit flattered by a \u00a3139m contribution from the one-off sale of 147 condominiums in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-21T17:08:09Z", "title": "Vodafone helps lift FTSE 100 to highest level since last May", "tags": ["Business", "Vodafone", "ARM", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "BAE Systems", "Morrisons", "InterContinental Hotels", "Millennium and Copthorne Hotels", "Imperial Tobacco", "Associated British Foods"], "article": "Leading shares enjoyed their biggest weekly rise since July with the FTSE 100 within striking distance once again of its record high.

Around 40% of the total will go to UK invetors, and is likely to make its way into other major FTSE 100 companies. Meanwhile the mobile phone group, which is distributing the payout following the $130bn sale of its stake in US joint venture Verizon Wireless, was one of the reasons for the market&apos;s recent strength, partly on renewed suggestions it could now become a bid target. It added 6.9p to 236.50p on Friday as UBS became the latest bank to issue a positive note on the business. UBS raised its target price from 260p to 275p, saying:  New Vodafone trades from Monday 24th ex-Verizon Wireless. It starts near a sector multiple of 6.1 times, too low in our view.  If the market does not realise this value, we wonder if a third party could.  US group AT&amp;T recently ruled itself out of a bid, but under takeover rules this only bars it from making a move for six months, and only then if there is not another bid or the Vodafone board agrees to a deal. Overall the FTSE 100 finished at 6838.06, up 25.07 points on the day and almost 175 points on the week. That was its highest level since 22 May last year and less than 100 points short of its record close of 6930 on 30 December 1999, the height of the dotcom boom. And technology was a main talking point during the week, with Facebook paying a startling $19bn for messaging service WhatsApp. In the UK, that brought chip designers Arm, which added 23p to 970p, and Imagination Technologies, up 3.5p to 186p, back into the investor spotlight. Arm was also helped by an outperform rating from Credit Suisse. A mixed bag of economic data during the week failed to hamper the market&apos;s rise, with weak Chinese growth numbers and disappointing US housing figures offset by a better than expected US manufacturing survey. Friday&apos;s UK retail sales disappointed, with a 1.5% fall in January, while a borrowing surplus of \u00a34.7bn was lower than expected. Even the chaos in Ukraine failed to stem the market&apos;s rise. Elsewhere Royal Bank of Scotland added 4.4p to 360.1p ahead of next week&apos;s results and amid reports of further job cuts. BAE Systems had a rocky week, moving higher on Wednesday as it resolved a long standing payment dispute with Saudi Arabia over a Eurofighter jets order. A day later it disappointed the market by warning US defence cuts would hit its 2014 profits, knocking 8% off its shares. But on Friday it recovered 10.9p to 411.3p. Morrisons suffered some profit taking, down 1.2p at 240.9p, after earlier moving higher on renewed talk of a possible buyout bid backed by private equity. InterContinental Hotels fell 50p to \u00a319.25 as Credit Suisse moved from neutral to underperform after a trading update earlier in the week disappointed investors. Many had been hoping for news of a cash payout following the group&apos;s disposal programme, but there was no such update. Still with the sector, Millennium and Copthorne Hotels climbed 17.5p to 589p after a 54% rise in full year profits to \u00a3263.6m, albeit flattered by a \u00a3139m contribution from the one-off sale of 147 condominiums in Singapore. The company is planning a final dividend of 11.51p a share and a special payout of 9.15p. Imperial Tobacco added 13p to \u00a323.73 following news that its Puritane e-cigarettes will be on sale in Boots stores from next Monday. Analyst Damian McNeela at Panmure Gordon said:  The launch... is slightly ahead of our expectations and should ease concerns over Imperial being a laggard in the space.  Finally Real Good Food, the ingredients and sugar group, slumped 25% to 47p after announcing that a continuing pricing dispute with key supplier British Sugar would hit profits this year and next. In an unexpected update, the group said its Napier Brown subsidiary, Europe&apos;s biggest non-refining sugar distributor, had filed a complaint to the Office of Fair Trading regarding &quot;an abuse of a dominant position&quot; by British Sugar, which is owned by Associated British Foods, up 26p at \u00a329.93.

It is not a fight to defend one of the nation&apos;s most priceless assets, or the soul of London. It is not a struggle between enlightenment and barbarism. On the other hand its \u00a3160m redevelopment as offices and shops is not, as supporters of the market&apos;s part-demolition claim, crucial to &quot;maintaining and enhancing the role of the City of London as the world&apos;s leading international and financial business centre&quot;. If the proposed 16,237 square metres of office space (about a third of a Gherkin, or a seventh of a Shard) are not built, those invaluable fat cats will not be scampering for the planes to Singapore and Frankfurt. It is rather a finely balanced argument about heritage and development. The market is now the subject of a public inquiry due to run until Friday, the second concerning this site in recent years, thanks to the intervention of the planning minister Nick Boles. His is a striking decision, given this government&apos;s aversion to holding inquiries relating to Unesco world heritage sites in Liverpool and London. Even if Boles&apos;s intervention looks tokenistic, however, the issues at Smithfield still matter. General Market is at one end of a long oblong block, on the north-west fringe of the City of London, that also includes the famous meat markets, which are still serving their original purpose and are not under threat. The meat markets&apos; fine Victorian structures are well maintained and protected as listed buildings. The General Market&apos;s buildings, like the meat markets&apos;, are by Sir Horace Jones, who was also the architect of Tower Bridge. They are less ornate than the meat markets, and were damaged in the war, but consist of an airy, atmospheric, top-lit market hall with iron columns and a graceful timber roof, wrapped in pleasant-but-not-remarkable support buildings in red brick. The site proposed for redevelopment also includes two neighbouring structures, the triangular Fish Market and a former cold store known as the Red House. After some hawing and humming, English Heritage decided some time ago against recommending the General Market for listing, although the Victorian Society have recently applied for it to be listed after all. The whole site is, however, in a conservation area, which means that the market buildings cannot be heedlessly destroyed.     A CGI of the proposed plan for office and retail space within the shell of the Victorian buildings. Photograph: Smithfield Quarter    Henderson Global Investors, who hold a long lease on the site from its freeholders, the Corporation of London, are proposing to remove the market hall but keep most of the brick wrapping and perch an office building on top. They also plan to keep the Fish Market, making it into a retail arcade, and demolish some of the Red House so that they can build another office building. They have hired the architects John McAslan and Partners to design the project \u2013 who, having made over the Grade-I listed King&apos;s Cross station and reconstructed the earthquake-hit Iron Market in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, can claim to know and care about such things. Henderson argue that no alternative is commercially viable. The Corporation of London are on their side, as are English Heritage, who formerly opposed substantial demolition. Save Britain&apos;s Heritage and the Victorian Society, who are leading the opposition, say that the market hall is an essential part of the building and must be kept. With the support of celebrities including Alan Bennett and Kristin Scott Thomas they argue that it&apos;s viable to make it into a specialist market of the kind that has been so successful in Borough and Spitalfields. Eric Reynolds, who long ago created the phenomenally successful Camden Lock Market, and helped make Spitalfields Market into an asset now worth \u00a3100m, is supporting their case, saying that he could work the same magic at Smithfield. Save say that alternatives to Henderson&apos;s scheme have not been properly tested in the open market, as was required following the last public inquiry. The arguments fly back and forth. Henderson&apos;s advisors rubbish Reynolds&apos; figures, and he rubbishes their rubbishing, saying that the advisors seem to know little about specialist markets. Henderson say the General Market is shabby and too difficult fully to repair. They take me on a long tour of its rat cemeteries and pigeon toilets to prove the point. Save say its poor condition is the fault of the Corporation of London, who should have done more to keep it intact.     The site proposed for redevelopment includes the neighbouring Fish Market. Photograph: Save Britain\u2019s Heritage    Save say that, although it has been locked up for many years, the General Market was always intended as a public space and should be one now, which means that the interior of the hall is as important to the experience of the conservation area as the brick exterior. Henderson say they are keeping 75% of the original building. Save disagree. Henderson says that the postwar rebuilding of its central dome makes it less worth keeping. Save say the dome is of value in its own right. There are some tragedies here, the first of which is that the whole tedious effort could have been avoided if English Heritage had not fluffed the decision of whether or not to list it. There are many buildings less remarkable than Smithfield General Market that are listed, and had it been so protected, the situation would have been much clearer. A Reynoldsian market might be up and running there by now. The second tragedy is that, if there is to be redevelopment, the choices of preservation and demolition in the Henderson scheme are the wrong way round. The special part is not the brick exterior but the hall and the roof, war damage notwithstanding. Its value is not just aesthetic, but in the fact that it can be a shared public space. Personally I would like it if a fancy specialist market were not the only alternative to demolition for places like this, but given that it probably is, such a future would enrich a sterile part of London. But the conservation discussion is framed in such a way that it is bad at recognising such qualities. It emphasises &quot;townscape&quot;, which means that the picturesque qualities of the facades and roof matter more than the urban experience of being in the hall. It treats the basically functional buildings of the old market as if they were works of artistic composition.     The derelict Smithfield General Market. Save Britain's Heritage say its poor condition is the fault of the Corporation of London. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images    In a wise world a way might be found to have the best of both plans. The hall could be kept, along with a new office building higher than the low-ish stepped design currently proposed, which for reasons of townscape feels obliged to limbo dance beneath an invisible height limit. It could be beautiful, this coexistence of market and office building, not a compromise. Since such wisdom is not on offer, what should the planning inquiry decide? I can see Henderson&apos;s arguments for allowing a building like Smithfield General Market, which was always functional and not-too-precious, to evolve and change. They may or may not be right that no alternative would pay its way \u2013 they make convincing arguments, but developers usually do in these circumstances. The market&apos;s previous leaseholders argued with equal force that total demolition was the only answer, and were proved wrong. But if you stand back, think, and consider what would be best for this part of London, the answer has to be a rare and beautiful public interior containing a lively specialist market. Or maybe something even better."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/23/guy-lodge-mister-john-diana-thor-dark-world-review", "sentences": ["The superb Aidan Gillen (recently seen leering to delicious effect on Game of Thrones) is on supremely taciturn form as a jaded London businessman who travels to Singapore to tidy up affairs following his brother&apos;s death \u2013 and finds it easier to slip into the dead man&apos;s shoes than he probably should do."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-23T00:05:08Z", "title": "Guy Lodge's DVDs and downloads", "tags": ["DVD and video reviews", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "     The Bafta awards have been and gone, and with them the eyebrow-raising announcement that Gravity, Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n&apos;s marvellous Hollywood space spectacle, was the best British film of the year, a classification made possible by its UK-produced effects work. Make of that what you will, but the list of great British (or even part-British) films ignored entirely by awards voters\u00a0this year is rather a long one, with the under-seen Irish co-production Mister John (Artificial Eye, 15) somewhere near the top. Husband-and-wife duo Joe Lawlor and Christine Molloy made a startling 2009 debut with Helen, and that film&apos;s thematic preoccupation with identities lost and assumed is extended in this even more accomplished follow-up. The superb Aidan Gillen (recently seen leering to delicious effect on Game of Thrones) is on supremely taciturn form as a jaded London businessman who travels to Singapore to tidy up affairs following his brother&apos;s death \u2013 and finds it easier to slip into the dead man&apos;s shoes than he probably should do. Lawlor and Molloy tease the viewer with thriller possibilities, but it&apos;s a film where tension exists chiefly within the protagonist as we (and perhaps even he) tangle with the motives behind his self-disappearance. Beautifully composed and immaculately played, it&apos;s the film Only God Forgives might be if it went off and had a good think.

All the best jokes about Oliver Hirschbiegel&apos;s portrait of a princess&apos;s post-divorce romantic awakening have already been made; to crack more is to suggest the film has acquired the status of essential high camp, and it&apos;s far too dull for that. If you must, fast-forward to the scene where Naomi Watts&apos;s relentlessly doe-eyed Diana asks her cardiac-surgeon beau if hearts can actually be broken, chuckle mildly, and then stick on Madonna&apos;s W.E. for proper House of Windsor hilarity. There&apos;s probably more authentic royal intrigue at play in Thor: The Dark World (Disney, 12), though that&apos;s faint praise indeed for this half-hearted superhero sequel, in which the bastardised Norse god (Chris Hemsworth) and his malevolent brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) are teamed up to battle indiscriminately sinister forces. Eschewing the rousing classicism and goofy fish-out-of-water farce of Kenneth Branagh&apos;s 2011 franchise starter, this feels altogether more directed by committee: one doubts accomplished TV man Alan Taylor had much say over the doomy tone, sludgy effects and jabs of Joss Whedon-esque snark. Hemsworth and Hiddleston&apos;s chemistry just about saves it; Natalie Portman looks to be considering participation via Skype in the next instalment.     The 'fine' Andrzej Chyra in Polish clerical drama In the Name Of. Photograph:  Film Movement/Courtesy Everett    Two arthouse releases arrive, coincidentally enough, a year after appearing in competition at Berlin. Polish clerical drama In the Name Of (Peccadillo, 15) centres on a handsome Catholic priest (a fine Andrzej Chyra) with a dark secret that is neither particularly dark nor particularly secret; the tasteful homoeroticism oozes from the opening frame. Director Malgorzata Szumowska dodges the story&apos;s potential for ripe melodrama. Another tale of Catholic inner conflict, decorative French period piece The Nun (Metrodome, 15) has no such qualms, least of all in Isabelle Huppert&apos;s bonkers turn as a sapphic abbess. On the streaming front, a relatively forgotten Disney title makes its way to Netflix this week, and with Frozen having recently revived the flagging fortunes of the company&apos;s animation arm, it&apos;s worth looking back to a time when things looked considerably bleaker for them. The most expensive animated feature in history at the time of its release in 1985, The Black Cauldron was a mortifying flop: surprisingly enough, kids didn&apos;t flock to a Welsh mythology-inspired tale of youths and bards fighting horned kings for control of a magical cooking vessel. Watch it again, however, and there&apos;s grace in Disney&apos;s folly: the storytelling is sophisticatedly dense, the pioneering computer-aided visuals frequently remarkable and Elmer Bernstein&apos;s orchestral score a treat."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/23/scottish-referendum-salmond-independence-oil", "sentences": ["There are big countries that are basket cases and small countries such as Singapore and Switzerland with high living standards."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-23T16:35:00Z", "title": "Scottish referendum: Salmond offers the independence of a granny flat", "tags": ["Scottish independence", "Scotland", "UK news", "Alex Salmond", "Politics", "Scottish politics", "Oil", "Petrol prices"], "article": "Scotland could make it as a fully independent country. It would be tough, especially at first, but there are plenty of examples of small rich nations. When it comes to economic success, size really doesn&apos;t matter. There are big countries that are basket cases and small countries such as Singapore and Switzerland with high living standards. Real independence is not on offer to the Scottish people in this September&apos;s referendum. The yes campaign is really suggesting that Scotland becomes Britain&apos;s Massachusetts, lacking its own currency and central bank but using its limited autonomy to have higher taxes and public spending, and to be altogether more groovy than the rest of the country. A number of issues arise from this, not least what constitutes real independence. To be fully independent a country must be in charge of its own affairs, be able to protect its own territory and run its economy. That means having its own currency, setting interest rates and having control over the budget. By this token, of course, eurozone members are not really truly independent. They have ceded some of their national autonomy to a central bank that sets monetary policy for all of them. This can make life hard, especially for some of the smaller members, but is seen as a price worth paying for the security it offers from currency fluctuations and speculation. So would Scotland be better off with its own central bank in Edinburgh setting borrowing costs and operating a currency unshackled from the pound sterling? It might well be, but only after a painful period of transition during which Scotland&apos;s government established its credibility and the supply side of the economy was improved. This period is likely to be measured in decades. The argument in favour of an independent Scotland setting its own monetary policy is the same as for Britain having its interest rates set by the Bank of England rather than by the ECB. It allows the central bank to set policy according to local conditions. There have been times when Scotland, and indeed all parts of the UK outside London and the south-east, have been adversely affected by monetary policy that has been too tight for their needs. But cutting loose from the rest of the UK would entail costs. Here are just three of the many reasons for thinking that would be the case. First, the UK runs a big budget deficit and an independent Scotland would be liable for a slice of that. It would need to borrow in the financial markets to do so. As a newly established state, this would be more expensive than it currently is for the UK government, particularly given the tax and spending promises made by the yes campaign. Second, if Alex Salmond succeeded in securing for an independent Scotland the lion&apos;s share of North Sea oil, Scotland would become a petro-currency. That would leave it even more vulnerable to fluctuations in the oil price than the UK currently is. When the price rose, the Scottish currency would rise and hot money would come flooding into the country. When it fell, the hot money would flood out again. These are the classic conditions for boom-bust. Third, Scotland is home to two extremely big banks that were kept afloat by the Treasury during the financial and economic crisis of 2008. In any repeat of those conditions, a Scottish government would be overwhelmed, and have the dilemma previously faced by Ireland and Iceland: do you ask for help from the International Monetary Fund to bail out the banks or do you let them go to the wall? Of course, a Scottish government could put curbs on the activities of the banks to prevent them behaving as foolishly as they have in the past. This would be no bad thing. T he risk, however, is that the banks would decide they no longer wanted to be domiciled in Scotland and would move somewhere they considered more congenial. Again, it could be argued that in the long term, Scotland&apos;s economy would benefit from being less dependent on finance, with a stronger productive base. But the short-term costs in terms of lost jobs and output would be considerable. There will be Scots who say hang the cost. They will argue that in the long term Scotland will be better off running its own affairs, and if that means accepting higher mortgage rates and lower living standards for a period then so be it. That&apos;s a perfectly respectable point of view. But as Salmond knows, there are not enough purists to win a referendum, so his pitch has been that Scotland can have the best of all worlds. It can be independent while using the pound. It can have most of the North Sea oil money while the rest of the UK picks up the tab for decommissioning fields as they run dry. It can have Scandinavian levels of public spending while the Bank of England provides Royal Bank of Scotland with a lender of last resort guarantee. But this is fantasy politics. The idea that after a yes vote, Scotland could quickly negotiate a currency union with the rest of the UK, and be accepted for EU membership without lengthy debate about such issues as whether Edinburgh would be eligible for a slice of the UK&apos;s budget rebate, seems improbable. The misgivings of the Bank of England and the Treasury about a currency union are valid: the experience of the eurozone is that a currency union without fiscal and banking union is inherently unstable. In the case of an independent Scotland, the tensions would quickly become apparent because the country that formed the smaller part of the currency union would have a social-democratic bent while the bigger part would, by virtue of having lost Scotland, have a more conservative economic approach. At the very least, there would be strict rules on Scotland&apos;s fiscal autonomy, with curbs on the size of its budget deficit. These sort of arrangements have proved burdensome for the smaller members of the eurozone and a post-referendum Scotland would find them difficult to accept. Perhaps that is the point: Salmond may be playing a long game in which Scots find a halfway house arrangement so unpalatable that they go for the real thing next time. For, make no mistake, this is a halfway house. There is a case for an independent Scotland, but it is not being made in the current campaign. It would be a strange sort of freedom in which all the decisions that matter are made in London. It is an independence of sorts but it is the independence of the granny flat."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/23/ukraine-crisis-western-nations-eu-russia", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s very, very early days, early hours, but the people of Ukraine seem to have demonstrated their wish to take their country into the future, to have stronger links with Europe, and I don&apos;t think we should be repelling that, we should be embracing that,&quot; he said speaking to journalists in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-24T00:19:00Z", "title": "Western nations scramble to contain fallout from Ukraine crisis", "tags": ["Ukraine", "Europe", "World news", "Viktor Yanukovych", "Yulia Tymoshenko", "Vladimir Putin", "Russia", "US foreign policy", "European Union"], "article": "Western governments are scrambling to contain the fallout from Ukraine&apos;s weekend revolution, pledging money, support and possible EU membership, while anxiously eyeing the response of Russia&apos;s president, Vladimir Putin, whose protege has been ousted.

Oleksandr Turchinov said the parliament should work to elect a government of national unity by Tuesday, before preparations begin for elections planned for 25 May. Yanukovych appeared on television from an undisclosed location on Saturday night, claiming he was still president and comparing the protesters to Nazis, but he continued to haemorrhage support on Sunday; even the leader of his parliamentary faction said he had betrayed Ukraine, and given &quot;criminal orders&quot;. Western leaders, while welcoming the unexpected turn of events in Kiev, are worried about the country fracturing along pro-Russian and pro-western lines. They are certain to push for a new government that is as inclusive as possible to replace the collapsed and discredited administration of Yanukovych, who vanished within hours of signing an EU-mediated settlement with opposition leaders on Friday. &quot;France, together with its European partners, calls for the preservation of the country&apos;s unity and integrity and for people to refrain from violence,&quot; said Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister. British chancellor George Osborne said early on Monday that the UK was standing ready to help the country through schemes set up by the IMF and European Union. &quot;It&apos;s very, very early days, early hours, but the people of Ukraine seem to have demonstrated their wish to take their country into the future, to have stronger links with Europe, and I don&apos;t think we should be repelling that, we should be embracing that,&quot; he said speaking to journalists in Singapore.  &quot;We should be there ready to provide financial assistance through organisations like the IMF, and of course a lot of this will take the form of loans and the like, but there will be good investments in the economy of Ukraine&quot;.  Putin, preoccupied with the closing ceremony of the Sochi Olympics, has not yet commented publicly on the violence of the past week and Yanukovych&apos;s flight from the capital. Angela Merkel phoned him on Sunday to press for assurances on Russia&apos;s reaction. Susan Rice, the national security adviser to Barack Obama, warned that Moscow would be making a &quot;grave mistake&quot; if it sent military aid to Ukraine.     Protesters roam the garden in front of the mansion of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych's home in Mezhygirya, near Kiev. Photograph: Etienne De Malglaive/Getty Images    &quot;There are many dangers,&quot; said William Hague, the foreign secretary. &quot;We don&apos;t know, of course, what Russia&apos;s next reaction will be. Any external duress on Ukraine, any more than we&apos;ve seen in recent weeks \u2026 it really would not be in the interests of Russia to do any such thing.&quot; Whether such nightmares are realised will hinge largely on the Kremlin&apos;s position and policies. Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister, has called the protesters on Independence Square &quot;pogromists&quot;, but it appears that Moscow is grudgingly coming to terms with the new reality. In a phone call with the US secretary of state, John Kerry, on Sunday, Lavrov accused the opposition of seizing power and failing to abide by the peace deal thrashed out on Friday. Analysts say Yanukovych, disgraced as he is, no longer holds any use for the Kremlin, but how the Russians will react on the ground is still an open question. This also partly depends on the new Ukraine government. One of the first issues the parliament tackled this weekend was that of the language, annulling a bill that provided for Russian to be used as a second official language in regions with large Russian-speaking populations. If the new government also looks to end the lease of a Black Sea naval base by the Russian military, the response from Moscow could be more aggressive. &quot;It will definitely depend on how the new government behaves,&quot; said Vladimir Zharikin, a Moscow-based analyst. &quot;If they continue with these revolutionary excesses then certainly, that could push other parts of the country towards separatist feelings. Let&apos;s hope that doesn&apos;t happen.&quot; In Kiev, the barricades around Independence Square remained in place, though the lines of riot police have long dissipated. Thousands of people came to the barricades to pay respects to the 77 people who died last week in the bloody clashes that eventually led to Yanukovych fleeing. As the third of three official days of mourning ended, priests continued to sing laments from the stage in the square. Between the soot-black pavements and the slate-grey sky, there were splashes of bright colour as thousands brought bunches of flowers to lay at makeshift memorials to the dead. At Yanukovych&apos;s residence outside Kiev, a team of investigative journalists went to work on a trove of documents fished from the water; the president&apos;s minders had apparently tried to destroy them before fleeing. Thousands of people again came to see the vast, luxurious compound with their own eyes. Tymoshenko, who has her eyes on the presidency, met the US and EU ambassadors in Kiev. She was released from prison on Saturday and went straight to Independence Square, where she promised to fight for a free Ukraine. There was ambivalence about the former PM among the protesters, with many feeling that she represents the divisive and corrupt politics of the past. There was no clear central authority in Kiev on Sunday, with the city patrolled by a self-proclaimed &quot;defence force&quot;, comprising groups of men wearing helmets and carrying baseball bats. Nevertheless, the mood was orderly and peaceful, and the protest representatives have been meeting with the police and security services in an attempt to restore a feeling of normality to the capital. With the country about to turn a new page in its history, for the first time since the crisis erupted in November senior EU officials spoke of the possibility of Ukraine joining the union which, if serious, would represent a major policy shift. &quot;We are at a historical juncture and Europe needs to live up to its historical moment and be able to provide Ukraine with an accession perspective in the medium to long term \u2013 if it can meet the conditions of accession,&quot; said the economics commissioner, Olli Rehn, at a G20 meeting in Australia. Until now, Brussels&apos;s policy towards Ukraine and other post-Soviet states, known as the eastern partnership, has been expressly intended as a substitute for rather than a step towards EU membership. It was the EU deal \u2013 Yanukovych&apos;s rejection of political and trade pacts with the bloc in favour of cheap loans and energy from Russia \u2013 that sparked the conflict and crisis in November. With the likelihood of Russia&apos;s $15bn (\u00a39bn) lifeline dissolving, the EU is under pressure to come up with funding to shore up the country&apos;s economy, on the brink of bankruptcy. &quot;We are ready to engage in substantial financial assistance for Ukraine once a political solution, based on democratic principles, is finalised and once there is a new government which is genuinely and seriously engaged in institutional and economic reforms,&quot; said Rehn. The EU said Baroness Ashton would travel to Ukraine on Monday. &quot;In Kiev she is expected to meet key stakeholders and discuss the support of the European Union for a lasting solution to the political crisis and measures to stabilise the economic situation,&quot; an EU statement said. The upshot is expected to be an IMF programme, supported by the US and the EU, although EU officials partly blame the IMF for the November fiasco by attaching strict terms to loans and prodding Yanukovych towards Moscow. &quot;We will be ready to engage, ready to help,&quot; said Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief who is also being tipped as a contender for a top job at the EU this year. The fund is likely to insist on major reforms and steps in an attempt to prevent the plunder of the country by Ukraine&apos;s oligarchs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/24/football-transfer-rumours", "sentences": ["Despite on-loan-at-Everton striker Romelu Lukaku being up for sale to anyone prepared to pay \u00a322m and Fernando Torres featuring prominently of the shopping list of Singapore-based billionaire Peter Lim, who is currently trying to take over La Liga outfit Valencia, Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has said it will be &quot;impossible&quot; to bring Radamal Falcao, Edinson Cavani or Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Stamford Bridge."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-24T08:51:01Z", "title": "Football transfer rumours: Toni Kroos to Manchester United?", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "Having added the loose change thrown at Wayne Rooney at Selhurst Park over the weekend to their club coffers, Manchester United have accumulated enough wealth to offer Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos a contract worth \u00a3250,000 per week, should he decide to leave the European Champions this summer. As Arsenal discovered to their cost last week, the 24-year-old from Greifswald in north east Germany can, according to Guardian Bundesliga correspondent Raphael Honigstein: &quot;play the killer pass, bring order and symmetry into congested space and, most importantly, keep possession for his team&quot;. For all that, he is apparently far from indispensable at Bayern, who have thus far rejected his exorbitant wage demands. Currently scraping by on a comparatively paltry stipend of \u00a380,000 per week, Kroos is believed to be available for a fee of around \u00a330m and is just one of several expensive transfer targets being lined up in the cross-hairs of United manager David Moyes. Borussia Dortmund&apos;s Ilkay G\u00fcndogan is another and several tabloids report that United are &quot;confident&quot; they&apos;ll land the 23-year-old central midfielder, who has been sidelined with a back injury since the opening game of his club&apos;s league campaign this season. Should the German international make a full recovery he could ink a deal with United that would see Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa go the other way and return to the club where he made his name. Whelpish Bayer Leverkusen winger Julian Brandt, 17, is also wanted by United. Described as &quot;one of the most talented players in German football&quot; by no less an authority than Leverkusen&apos;s sporting director Rudi V\u00f6ller, Brandt only joined the club from Wolfsburg last month, as they promised him first team football. The teenager had looked to be on his way to Chelsea, who will almost certainly attempt to step up their efforts to secure his signature if they feel they can turn his head. With so many players being tipped to leave Germany in the summer, there ought to be no shortage of vacant training ground parking spaces and Bayern Munich may offer one to Newcastle&apos;s Mathieu Debuchy.

And in managerial news, Harry Redknapp&apos;s future at QPR looks a mite uncertain. Already rumoured to be considering retirement come season&apos;s end as a result of persistent pain in one of his knees, speculation now abounds that the club&apos;s recent slide down the Championship table could cost him his job much sooner.

But the argument in favour of self-driving cars is far broader, with huge positive effects on the quality of life in our cites by redistributing our access to shared and sustainable transport. Popular car sharing programs such as Zipcar are effectively two-way rental schemes: the user picks up a vehicle and returns it to the same location. This is easy to manage, but severely limits the market for sharing schemes. Point-to-point systems such as bike-sharing programmes allow users to pick-up and drop-off vehicles at different locations. If properly designed these schemes can be complementary to public transport. Users can take a bus or subway train and then transfer to a shared bicycle for the last mile of their trip. But bikes tend to cluster at popular locations at certain times of the day, while other locations may be devoid of available vehicles. Shared bike programmes solve this problem by redistributing bikes manually via truck. This is very costly and operators can never keep up with the demand for redistribution. Studies point to the significant impact bike redistribution has on total operational costs in running a shared bike programme. Clearly using trucks to move cars is hardly a reasonable proposition. But with autonomous vehicles, we can solve this problem and release the power of the collaborative consumption economy. Imagine the following scenario: a customer uses a smartphone app to request an autonomous shared vehicle, it arrives at your door and drops you to your destination, and the vehicle then either moves on and picks up another customer or parks itself and recharges. A recent study by my colleagues at MIT&apos;s Aero/Astro department, led by professor Emilio Frazzoli, estimated that a fleet of 300,000 autonomous shared vehicles could serve the entire population of Singapore (almost 6 million people) with a maximum 15 minute waiting time during peak hours. Today 800,000 private cars are owned by less than 12% of the city state&apos;s population and as a result most people use Singapore&apos;s world-class transit system. As a comparison, the ownership rate of private automobiles is nearly 80% (797 out of 1,000 people) in the US.  The use of such few vehicles underscores the potential of shared autonomous vehicles to radically alter how we move about and design our cities \u2013 and cut the substantial resources that we consume to transport people and goods. However, simply adding autonomous technologies to our existing private-automobile based economy would be a major lost opportunity, as other experts have already argued. If you&apos;ll pardon the pun, this will only fuel our automobile-dependent society by reinforcing unsustainable low density, sprawling urban development. If we continue to drive alone (as most people do) we would still suffer from congestion and the time, energy, and environmental impact it creates. Improved traffic flow may encourage those used to using public transport to shift to the shared vehicles, once again increasing the volume on our already clogged roads. What&apos;s more, customers may now spend even more time in an autonomous vehicle and live further from their destination away since they could now use that time to check email, for example, or even eat a meal. The challenges for autonomous vehicles, either shared or private, are many: the technology still costs upwards of $200,000 (\u00a3119,624) per vehicle; we need progressive policies to allow autonomous vehicles on our roads (they currently require a &quot;safety driver&quot; - a passenger sitting in the driver&apos;s seat in case something goes wrong, which undermines the autonomous sharing proposal); and data needs to be managed carefully to protect the privacy and location of users. Autonomous vehicles are not the stuff of science fiction. The technology has existed for years and recent research has elevated the field from experiment to near-commercial readiness. Experts know this, but all interested parties have potentially conflicting goals. Visionary leaders in every sector \u2013 from government to industry and research \u2013 must act now, before autonomous vehicle technologies become inexpensive and ubiquitous, so that they can be managed for the greatest benefit to society.

The suggestion from the home secretary&apos;s migration advisory committee was criticised by immigration lawyers for creating an &quot;eBay culture&quot; for permanent UK residence. Under the proposal, overseas millionaires will be invited to bid for a limited proportion of investor or tier-one UK visas that allow holders and their families to live indefinitely in Britain. Professor David Metcalf, the chairman of the committee, said: &quot;Some people say isn&apos;t it awful to sell off visas? Well, it is better than giving them away, which is what we are doing now.&quot; The proposals are being put forward in response to concerns that the existing investor visa route fails to benefit the UK and has become a cheap way for some wealthy Russian, Chinese and Middle Eastern families to settle permanently in Britain. The existing route, known as tier one of the points-based immigration system, lets rich individuals accelerate the process of being allowed to settle in the UK by between two and five years depending on how much is invested. Applications have been running at about 600 a year to apply under this route, which does not require applicants to be able to speak English or have a job to come to. Official concern over the use being made of tier-one visas first came to light in December 2012 when the Home Office announced that leveraged investment funds held in offshore accounts could not be used to fund their investments in Britain. There has also been concern that the investments made have often been in government gilts or loans to the applicant&apos;s own businesses, neither of which are directly beneficial to the British economy. The committee proposes that about 100 &quot;premium&quot; investor visas should be auctioned off each year with sealed bids and a minimum reserve price of \u00a32.5m. Successful bidders would be expected to invest at least that amount in gilts, infrastructure bonds and other investments. They would be required to donate \u00a3500,000 to a &quot;good causes&quot; fund. The current \u00a31m minimum to qualify for the route is to be raised to \u00a32m and the &quot;premium&quot; route for those willing to invest \u00a35m and \u00a310m is to be scrapped. In return, they would get a fast-track route to the right to settle permanently in Britain in two years instead of five years and a relaxed residency requirement, meaning they would only need to spend 90 days a year instead of 180 days a year to qualify. They would not automatically get a UK passport but would have to apply in the normal way. A total of 560 overseas millionaires applied for investor visas in the 12 months to last September. Fifty of the applicants were turned down. Most who have applied have been Russian and Chinese. Metcalf said the idea of a visa auction had been experimented with in Singapore but the committee had come to the solution as a group of economists trying to find a mechanism to establish the market price. &quot;At the moment the Brits get very little out of this and the investors get an awful lot. With an auction that requires them to give money to good causes, such as funding for cancer research.&quot; He denied it was selling passports. Metcalf has told MPs he believes it is time to think more creatively about the operation of the investor visa route. &quot;It may very well be that we should be auctioning some of these slots,&quot; he told the Commons home affairs select committee. &quot;There should be a proper discussion about it. Equally it may well be that we should be letting people in if they endow a Cambridge college, a major teaching hospital or the London School of Economics with \u00a310m,&quot; he added. Nick Rollason, head of business immigration at the Kingsley Napley law firm, warned that an auction of investors&apos; visas would create an &quot;eBay culture&quot; for visas that would be unpopular with the British public. Another leading immigration lawyer, Sophie Barrett-Brown of Laura Devine Solicitors, said: &quot;An auction approach has, rightly, been rejected by the Home Office previously (when the points-based system was first introduced) and sent out the wrong message to the public.&quot; She said the alternative suggestions expected in the advisory committee&apos;s report had to be seen in the context that it had been asked to provide an analysis and recommendations on the economic impact of tier-one investors. &quot;The UK government will take into account wider policy considerations in deciding which of the committee&apos;s suggestions to follow,&quot; she said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/feb/25/build-overseas-campus-international-student-nottingham-malaysia", "sentences": ["Keeping up standards at arms-length A number of countries were looking to position themselves as educational hubs, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-25T11:42:00Z", "title": "Why it still makes sense to build an overseas campus", "tags": ["Higher Education Network", "International", "Student experience", "Partnerships", "Higher education", "Education", "International students", "University of Nottingham", "Students"], "article": "Students have always travelled in search of the best study opportunities and researchers have always collaborated across borders. But until fairly recently, higher education institutions have been stubbornly national \u2013 whether limited by the demands of domestic regulation or by protectionist approaches in potential destinations. With the exception of a small number of private sector initiatives and small-scale overseas study centres, universities have for the most part remained fundamentally bound by their geography. But the past 20 years or so have seen almost seismic shifts in context, policy and regulation, and in attitudes and behaviour. Now a new report by the British Council on opportunities for UK universities in India has warned them off investing in the bricks and mortar of an overseas campus. Instead, it points to calls from Indian higher education officials for more research partnerships. All this comes in the context of a big growth in the number of degree programmes being delivered through international partnerships, as shown by new statistics on the number of people studying for UK degrees abroad. And despite the words of caution above, institutional mobility has much to offer universities \u2013 it is a realistic strategic option. Pushed and pulled overseas The University of Nottingham opened its Malaysia campus back in 2000. A number of push and pull factors made the idea of an international campus particularly attractive \u2013 and they still apply. Estimates suggest fewer than 5% of students globally travel overseas for their education, a figure which is unlikely to increase dramatically. So, establishing a physical presence internationally would provide the opportunity to work with staff and students who would not, or could not, come to the UK. A range of factors, including considerations of scale, funding and demographics, placed limits on domestic expansion. And, as other countries became more active in terms of international student recruitment, it became increasingly clear that UK institutions would need to be innovative if they wished to continue to attract high-quality students and staff. Keeping up standards at arms-length A number of countries were looking to position themselves as educational hubs, including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Singapore. Malaysia had formulated an ambition to be a major higher education destination by 2020 and saw international university campuses as key to delivery. Malaysian students had been coming to study at Nottingham since the late 1940s and there were many supportive alumni in prominent positions in public and corporate life. Making the decision to build a campus in Kuala Lumpur was only half the battle. Implementation remains a major challenge. Nottingham&apos;s approach has been to stress the idea of &quot;one university, multiple campuses&quot;. What this meant in practice was that the Malaysian campus (and subsequently the campus in China, opened in 2004) had to be full parts of the university. Not just a teaching outpost University of Nottingham Overseas campus cannot just be teaching outposts. They have to be functionally equivalent campuses. The operational challenge for the university has related to delivery \u2013 and specifically how to deliver the University of Nottingham educational experience at arms-length. To address this challenge, both of Nottingham&apos;s international campuses rely on the leadership of senior academics seconded from the UK campus, working alongside locally recruited staff. What to keep the same A major issue in building a new campus overseas relates to the balance between standardisation and adaptation. How much should be identical across campuses and how much should be adapted to local context? This matters for two reasons. Pragmatically, an international campus can only really work if students can be confident that they are receiving an education and a qualification that is comparable in quality and standards to that delivered in the institution&apos;s home country. Morally, education is of such importance to people and to societies that those institutions who provide it must accept a responsibility to ensure that what they offer is right in terms quality and standards. But, it would also be wrong to ignore the need to adapt to local legal and cultural contexts. The social side of life on-campus and the ways programmes are marketed require adaption to fit with the host country. Easy to say, not so easy to do. Regular staff visits, frequent meetings and a committee structure that operates across borders all help. Management processes also need to balance strategic central direction with the right degree of local operational autonomy. The outcome has been a campus with close to 5,000 students, a significant research portfolio and an active student community. It has been financially sustainable for a number of years, and is generating surpluses which are reinvested in the growth and development of the university&apos;s activities at its Malaysian campus.

It has posted an underlying loss before tax of $252m for the last six months of 2013, as the Abbott government considers potential assistance for Qantas, which has complained about an \u201cuneven playing field\u201d in the airline industry. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said the \u201ctruly devastating\u201d job cuts represented the worst day in Australian aviation since the collapse of Ansett. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Tony Sheldon, raised the prospect of strike action unless the government worked with the airline to find ways to avoid the job losses. \u201cBut if [the treasurer] Joe Hockey\u2019s not prepared to do that, then it\u2019s industrial action that the workforce should be considering,\u201d Sheldon said. Australia\u2019s national airline cited a \u201cdeterioration in business performance and operating environment\u201d for the need to reduce full-time-equivalent positions by 5000, including 1000 job cuts flagged in early December. More than 50 aircraft would be deferred or sold. Chief executive Alan Joyce said the company would accelerate its \u201cQantas transformation program\u201d to achieve $2bn in cost reductions by the 2016-17 financial year. He said he regretted the need for the job losses and they were not a reflection on the performance of hard-working Qantas employees. \u201cHard decisions will be necessary to overcome the challenges we face and build a stronger business,\u201d Joyce said, flagging talks with unions on Friday. \u201cThere are many examples of Australian companies that have failed because they have not been prepared to make the hard decisions. Qantas is not one of them.\u201d Qantas said the 5,000 full-time equivalent positions across the group would incur about $500m in redundancy costs across the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15. This would include a reduction of management and non-operational areas by about 1,500 full-time-equivalent positions and the loss of operational positions affected by fleet and network changes. Joyce said every aspect of the company would be affected. Unions complained about a lack of consultation, arguing the cuts would deepen Australia\u2019s \u201cjobs crisis\u201d. Qantas had already implemented a wage freeze for executives but now wants to extend this to all Qantas Group employees. The company said it would freeze wages until the Qantas Group made a full-year underlying profit \u2013 a move that would be ongoing for executives, immediate for open enterprise bargaining agreements (EBAs) and proposed for other EBA-covered staff. Line maintenance operations and catering facilities would also be restructured, including the previously announced closure of the Adelaide catering centre. Qantas would proceed with its previously announced closure of the Avalon maintenance base. Qantas said it would exit underperforming routes and make aircraft changes on certain routes to better match capacity to demand. This would include withdrawing Qantas International from the Perth-Singapore route and operating all Sydney-Singapore and Brisbane-Singapore services with A330-300s from later this year. Qantas said it would adjust the timing of services between Melbourne and London to reduce A380 ground time in Heathrow, but the overall capacity on this route would not change. Qantas shares fell about 7.5% to $1.17 in morning trade. The government has been considering providing Qantas with an emergency debt guarantee, despite unease from some senior ministers and Liberal backbenchers. Virgin has argued a debt guarantee would give Qantas a \u201cleg-up\u201d worth at least $100m a year and would amount to \u201cpicking winners\u201d.  It is understood the government\u2019s preferred course of action would be to remove government-imposed restrictions, including on the level of foreign ownership, set out in the Qantas Sale Act. But the prospects of getting such changes through parliament are murky. Joyce said Labor and the Greens had indicated they would not support changing the Qantas Sale Act, meaning such legislation was unlikely to pass before the new Senate takes effect in July. He noted the Palmer United party, which will have a powerful role in the new Senate, had also signalled its opposition, indicating no changes to the act were realistic in the short term. Joyce said Qantas could compete \u201cin any fair fight\u201d and he would continue discussions with the government about levelling the playing field. \u201cThe Australian domestic market has been distorted by current Australian aviation policy, which allows Virgin Australia to be majority-owned by three foreign government-backed airlines \u2013 yet retain access to Australian bilateral flying rights. Late last year, these three foreign-airline shareholders invested more than $300m in Virgin Australia at a time when, as Virgin Australia reported to the ASX on 6 February, it was losing money,\u201d Joyce said. Shorten accused the government of not acting quickly enough to spell out its clear plans to assist Qantas, having known of the need for action since 6 December. \u201cThat the Abbott government has done nothing to try and fight for Australian jobs at Qantas, like they failed to do anything for Australian jobs in other closures announced, is truly alarming,\u201d he said. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Dave Oliver, said the 5000 workers had been dealt a major blow through no fault of their own. Oliver said the company\u2019s business plans were focused on \u201cmanaging decline and not necessarily going for growth\u201d. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement further plunges Australia into a jobs crisis,\u201d he said.

John Robinson Jumbo: The Plane That Changed The World9pm, BBC2 The Boeing 747 changed the game for air travel, not least by swankily installing a spiral staircase on a plane. A lumbering beast compared with the sleek tubes that preceded it, its construction hangar is the largest by volume ever built, and the plane took Boeing to the brink of bankruptcy before it paid off. This documentary looks at its gestation. Car batteries, we learn, were used as backup power on the first flight. Ben\u00a0Beaumont-Thomas The Storms That Stole Christmas9pm, Channel 4 The flooding across the UK has dominated the news agenda for the last few weeks, but the storms have been around for almost two months now. This documentary looks at the weather that battered the country over Christmas, causing felled trees, cancelled trains and airport chaos, and leaving at least 50,000 homes without power. Using footage recorded by the people who experienced the storms as well as eyewitness testimony and expert commentary, the film relives and explains the devastation.

The prime minister said it was a \u201cvery troubling day\u201d and he grieved with workers facing an uncertain future, but moved to dampen expectations the government would offer a debt guarantee. \u201cThe difficulty is this: what we do for one business, in fairness, we have to make available to all businesses,\u201d Abbott told parliament on Thursday. The government attempted to refocus the debate on changes to the Qantas Sale Act \u2013 which restricts foreign ownership of the airline \u2013 after Qantas posted its figures for the last six months of 2013. Qantas shares closed down 9% at $1.16. The government would face difficulty getting Senate approval to remove the 49% foreign ownership cap, but Labor has not ruled out discussions about amendments to other thresholds outlined in the act. Qantas unveiled job losses and route changes as it reaffirmed its argument it was competing at a disadvantage to Virgin, which is majority-owned by three foreign government-backed airlines. The chief executive, Alan Joyce, said Qantas could compete \u201cin any fair fight\u201d and he would continue discussions with the government about levelling the playing field. Australia\u2019s national carrier cited a \u201cdeterioration in business performance and operating environment\u201d for the need to reduce full-time-equivalent positions by 5,000, including 1,000 job cuts flagged in early December. More than 50 aircraft would be deferred or sold as part of a $2bn package of cost savings by 2016-17. Joyce said he regretted the need for the job losses and they were no reflection on the performance of hard-working Qantas employees.  But the Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Tony Sheldon, raised the prospect of strike action unless the government worked with the airline to find ways to avoid the job losses. \u201cBut if [the treasurer] Joe Hockey\u2019s not prepared to do that, then it\u2019s industrial action that the workforce should be considering,\u201d Sheldon said. In question time, the opposition sought to extract concrete details from the government about its plans to support Qantas. Abbott said the government was seeking to abolish the carbon tax, as it was costing Qantas more than $100m each year, and cut red tape. \u201cWe will create a million new jobs within five years; we will create 2 million new jobs within a decade,\u201d he said, reaffirming his election pledge. \u201cThe challenge of government is not to guarantee every single existing job; the challenge of government is to ensure that there are new and better jobs available to the workers of Australia when they want them and when they need them.\u201d Asked about speculation on a standby debt facility, Abbott said the government had been in regular discussions with Qantas and would do what it could \u201cconsistent with responsible economic management\u201d. The prime minister raised fairness as an objection to the proposal, saying: \u201cWhy should the government do for one what it is not prepared to do for all?\u201d He said amending the Qantas Sale Act would ensure the airline could \u201ccompete on a level playing field\u201d. \u201cWe want to ensure that Qantas is not competing against its rivals with a ball and chain around its leg. That\u2019s what we are trying to ensure,\u201d Abbott said. The deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, defended his comments, in an interview with Fairfax Media, that Qantas wages and cost structures placed the company at a significant disadvantage to its competitors, including Asian and Middle Eastern carriers with pay rates that were \u201cvery much lower\u201d. Labor\u2019s transport spokesman, Anthony Albanese, asked whether there was \u201cany occasion in which workers lose their jobs in which this government doesn\u2019t blame those very workers themselves\u201d. Truss said he was not blaming workers, or arguing for wage cuts. The unions say they would prefer support in the form of a debt guarantee for Qantas, rather than changes to foreign ownership laws. But Virgin has argued a debt guarantee would give Qantas a \u201cleg-up\u201d worth at least $100m a year and would amount to \u201cpicking winners\u201d.  The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, accused the government of acting too slowly to spell out a clear plan to assist Qantas, leaving the workers \u201cin a state of insecurity\u201d. Shorten said he would be interested in discussing a proposal to guarantee the company\u2019s debt. He indicated he would also be open to talks about raising the limit of 25% a single foreign investor was allowed to invest in the company. Albanese said raising the 25% cap was included in the former Labor government\u2019s aviation white paper, but noted that the total current level of foreign ownership was not \u201cpushing up against the barrier\u201d of 49%. \u201cIt\u2019s not the issue and today Mr Joyce made it clear what his priorities were,\u201d Albanese said. Joyce played down the prospect of imminent changes to the Qantas Sale Act, noting opposition from Labor and the Greens, which retain a combined majority in the Senate. Joyce noted the Palmer United party, which will have a powerful role in the new Senate from July, had also rejected the idea, indicating no changes to the act were realistic in the short term. The independent senator Nick Xenophon called for an inquiry into Qantas\u2019s finances, saying the government should not hand over any assistance if the current management remained in place. \u201cAlan Joyce should be ashamed of himself announcing thousands of job losses when the job that should be going is his,\u201d Xenophon said. The deputy leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, warned against relaxing foreign ownership rules, saying \u201cmoney and jobs could be on the next 747 flight to Singapore or Kuala Lumpur\u201d. On 13 February, Hockey raised expectations of government assistance for Qantas, when he said the airline met four \u201ccrucial tests\u201d for government involvement in individual enterprises. These tests were whether that business was subject to government-imposed restrictions that did not apply to competitors; whether the business was fundamental to the economy; whether other governments were actively supporting other players; and whether the company was trying to fix its own balance sheet."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/27/lego-builds-record-profit", "sentences": ["&quot;But we want to be a Danish company that&apos;s welcoming to all sorts of cultures.&quot; To do so the company is diversifying senior management into four global offices in London, Singapore, Shanghai and Connecticut."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-27T20:40:29Z", "title": "Lego builds yet another record profit to become world's top toymaker", "tags": ["Business", "Lego", "Denmark"], "article": "It is a brand name familiar to children around the world, but a decade ago Lego was in crisis. Sales were collapsing at a rate of 26% a year, it lost 1.4bn Danish kroner (\u00a3150m) in 2003 and private equity firms were circling the 82-year-old family-owned Danish company. Now, after a series of job cuts and the ending of the family&apos;s management of the company, the plastic brick business has rebuilt itself into the world&apos;s most profitable toy maker ahead of Barbie&apos;s Mattel. The company, which has been headquartered in the small Danish town of Billund (population 6,155) since 1932, has reported &quot;another record breaking year&quot; of sales and profits growth \u2013 for the ninth consecutive year. Its high profitability comes from its ability to turn each kilogram of raw material plastic \u2013 which costs less than $1 \u2013 into sets that sell for more than $75 per kg. Annual profits increased by almost 10% to 8.2bn kroner (\u00a3900m) \u2013 about the same as the profit Facebook turned in last year. Sales jumped 10% to 25.3bn kroner (\u00a32.8bn). &quot;That is an incredible quadrupling of our revenues in less than 10 years,&quot; Joergen Vig Knudstorp, Lego chief executive, said. &quot;We think we are changing children&apos;s lives forever when they play with Lego. We think this was another year where we got great affirmation of that.&quot; Knudstorp is credited with driving Lego&apos;s resurgence since he took over as CEO from Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, grandson of the company&apos;s carpenter founder, during the 2003-4 crisis. He said Lego&apos;s success was due to constant innovation and the creation of 60-70 new products every year, including Harry Potter, Star Wars and SpongeBob SquarePants ranges. But he admitted it is still a &quot;major innovation challenge&quot; to &quot;stay on the top of children&apos;s wish lists&quot; against competition from iPads and computer games. &quot;We need to constantly become better, or otherwise there will be someone out there who will catch up to us,&quot; he said. Jane Westgarth, a toy analyst at market research firm Mintel, said Lego&apos;s recovery had been fuelled by its investment in quality and design. &quot;They are doing things that are taking Lego into a slightly different position, from the boxes of bricks where you had to use your imagination to sets you use in specific ways with characters you already know,&quot; she said. &quot;If it&apos;s good quality, people are prepared to pay that little bit extra.&quot; Westgarth said Lego was also benefiting considerably from parents&apos; nostalgia for their own childhood \u2013 parents including David Beckham, who admitted earlier this month that he builds Lego with his children to stay calm and had just completed the 4,287-piece Tower Bridge kit. &quot;For a parent aged 30 there&apos;s no doubt about it that they would have Lego in their homes. Parents like to introduce their children to things that they loved as children.&quot; The company, which sold its Legoland theme parks to Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments in 2005, is building on its &quot;red core business&quot; by boosting its digital presence, but Knudstorp said his customers have done most of the work for him. More than 99% of Lego videos on Youtube \u2013 featuring Lego recreations of everything from the London 2012 Olympics to the New Testament \u2013 are made by users. &quot;We&apos;re not leaving the brick, but we will leverage digital technology to stay relevant over the next 20 years,&quot; he said. Lego, which is derived from the Danish &quot;leg godt&quot; meaning &quot;play well&quot;, is also benefiting from &quot;a considerable amount of excitement&quot; prompted by the Lego Movie. The film, which features the hit Tegan and Sara song Everything is Awesome, is taking \u00a32m a day in UK cinema box offices, and has topped the US and Canadian charts for three consecutive weekends. Next up is Knudstorp&apos;s &quot;pretty simple ambition&quot; to &quot;take the bricks all over the world&quot;. Lego is sold in more than 130 countries round the world, but Knudstorp admits that &quot;we&apos;re not really there&quot; in many of the world&apos;s less well off nations. &quot;We see a huge opportunity to bring Lego further out into the world in the next 20 years,&quot; he said. Sales in China, where Lego will open a new $300m factory in 2016, grew by more than 50% last year - although from asmall base. Knudstorp believes Lego could be expanded to 600m Chinese customers within in the next decade.&quot;But we need a set up that is much more diverse, much more international, than we are today. &quot;It would be arrogant to think that just because you&apos;re Danish you&apos;re equally knowledgeable about what it takes to succeed in countries all over the world,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to remain very much a Danish company rooted here in Billund, a place where we were born and we have our heritage and we will never leave. &quot;But we want to be a Danish company that&apos;s welcoming to all sorts of cultures.&quot; To do so the company is diversifying senior management into four global offices in London, Singapore, Shanghai and Connecticut. The company is still owned by the descendents of Ole Kirk Kristiansen, a master carpenter and joiner who founded the company in Billund in 1932, when it was a small village. Ole&apos;s son Godtfred joined the firm when he was 12 years old, and the company&apos;s first toy was a wooden duck called Lego. The first plastic bricks were produced in 1949. Godtfred&apos;s son Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen was chief executive from 1979-2004. Forbes magazine named Kjeld as Denmark&apos;s richest man with a net worth of $7.3bn in March 2013. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the family&apos;s current wealth."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/28/qantas-needs-to-grow-up-a-bailout-wont-solve-its-problems", "sentences": ["If the taxpayers of Singapore, New Zealand, and the United Arab Emirates want to continue to subsidise the airfares of Australian consumers, frankly that is a matter for them."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-28T00:32:22Z", "title": "Qantas needs to grow up - a bailout won't solve its problems | Aaron Lane", "tags": ["Qantas", "Australia news", "Business", "Australian politics", "Unions"], "article": "If we really care about the long-term viability of Qantas, the worst thing the government can do is offer any sort of debt guarantee.  There is no doubt that Qantas is facing serious financial difficulties. There is also no doubt that yesterday\u2019s profit results will be especially felt by 5,000 Qantas employees that will be laid off as the company looks for $2bn in savings. Ultimately, however, Qantas needs to grow up and not look to government to solve its problems.  It is easy to be swept up in sentimental feelings about having a \u201cnational carrier\u201d, and wanting to help an \u201cAussie icon\u201d. Beyond sentimentality, no one has offered a convincing argument as to why Qantas is a special case in need of government assistance.  A debt guarantee is corporate welfare. It would potentially put billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money at risk, and provide the airline with millions of dollars\u2019 worth of tangible benefits by way of cheaper credit. Yesterday, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce complained that Qantas was under pressure in the domestic travel market from foreign \u201cgovernment-backed\u201d competitor Virgin Australia. If the taxpayers of Singapore, New Zealand, and the United Arab Emirates want to continue to subsidise the airfares of Australian consumers, frankly that is a matter for them. Australian consumers have been the beneficiaries of this increased competition. Importantly, no one is claiming that Qantas is destined to fail without government intervention. The opposite is true. The great tragedy of any bailout package is that it discourages companies from being competitive by rewarding inefficiency and loss-making behaviour. In the long run, companies become dependent on corporate welfare, and the vicious cycle continues until eventually a decision is made to turn off life support.  The slow death of Australian car manufacturing is the obvious case study. Corporate welfare in that industry has finally ended after 60 years of being drip fed a mixture of quotas, tariffs, tax concessions and direct cash handouts. If the government bails out Qantas, it will be destined for the same fate.  The government\u2019s role in this situation is to foster the best economic and regulatory environment possible. Removing substantial barriers to foreign investment would be a good start towards allowing Qantas to remain globally competitive. The government should proceed with repealing sections of the Qantas Sale Act that cap foreign ownership. An ambitious government would also abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board to boost investment Australia wide. There is also scope to reforming Australia\u2019s anti-competitive and outdated industrial relations system. Qantas has been particularly affected by the increase in union power delivered by the Rudd and Gillard governments. For example, in 2011, the Transport Workers Union (TWU) hijacked the enterprise bargaining process as a mechanism to prevent Qantas from utilising employees of its subsidiaries, and from engaging contractors, in order to remain cost competitive. Although the Fair Work Commission eventually rejected the union\u2019s restrictions, this was not before Qantas was forced to make the extraordinary decision of grounding its fleet in order to bring unions to the bargaining table. Qantas estimated that industrial action by three separate unions in 2011 cost the company $68m, disrupted 70,000 passengers and saw 600 flights cancelled. To put these costs in perspective, Qantas yesterday announced a $252 million half-year loss. True to form, the TWU yesterday threatened strike action to prevent Qantas from restructuring to make its business viable. While it is pleasing that the government has recently announced sensible amendments to the Fair Work Act, these changes are relatively minor compared to the entire re-regulation of the labour market under Labor. A true industry assistance package would increase access to foreign investment, deregulate the labour market, cut the cost of business and allow businesses to make their own decisions.   That would not just bail out Qantas, but hundreds of thousands of businesses right around the country.

Hong Kong&apos;s domestic workers have few places to meet on their only day off; many have huddled under flyovers to stay dry as they chat to friends. But this group is grinning as they brave the downpour. Some are barefoot in the puddles as they dance in plastic raincoats, twisting left to right and raising their hands to the heavens. &quot;Women united will never be divided! Migrants united will never be divided!&quot; chant women in hijab, dipping and turning alongside others in hot pants. &quot;With this kind of solidarity, people can be heard,&quot; said Eni Lestari, chair of the International Migrant Workers Alliance, as she surveyed the rally. &quot;More and more people are speaking out. But in terms of conditions, it&apos;s not getting better.&quot; The numbers of foreign domestic helpers, overwhelmingly female, have soared across the Asia-Pacific region. In 1992, Hong Kong had slightly more than 100,000; now there are three times as many. Malaysia has 125,000; in Thailand, 88,000 were registered in 2010. But the true numbers are thought to be far higher for all three. The Filipino and Indonesian diaspora have been joined by Burmese, Nepalese and Cambodian workers. But the flow of migrants, and their growing voice, has far outpaced their progress in winning protections. Reports of exploitation by employers and agencies are rife; rights are limited. While Singapore recently introduced a statutory weekly day off, campaigners say it is not being adequately enforced and employers can legally avoid granting it by increasing pay. Migrants in Taiwan have been fighting for the same right, without success. The One Billion Rising event in Hong Kong \u2013 one of many worldwide demanding an end to violence against women \u2013 had a particular resonance for the domestic workers who organised and participated in it. Recent allegations of abuse have spurred a fresh push for improved conditions and rights. In September, a judge jailed a couple who had tortured and beaten their maid with a bicycle chain. Last month, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih returned home to Indonesia with extensive injuries and reportedly weighing less than four stone (25kg). Her employer has since been charged with wounding, common assault and criminal intimidation. Lestari, who is from Indonesia, knows from experience how vulnerable and isolated workers can be. She said her first employers did not give her a single day off in four months; paid her only half her promised wages; insisted she eat pork despite her being Muslim; and banned her from talking to people outside the house. &quot;I didn&apos;t know where the consulate was; I didn&apos;t know the immigration department; my passport was kept by the agency. I ran away and an NGO helped me to find shelter,&quot; she said. First she learned about her rights; then she shared her new knowledge with others. As an Indonesian worker, she credits Filipino women \u2013 who came to Hong Kong earlier \u2013 for helping teach later arrivals how to organise. Social media ensures that information spreads fast, particularly since domestic workers are unusually dependent on their mobile phones for communication with the outside world. Improved awareness of their rights enables them to challenge unfair treatment. But &quot;our problem is not simply bad employers, but bad policies&quot;, Lestari said. Domestic workers&apos; organisations, and the new HK Helpers campaign supporting them, are seeking to end abuses by agencies who charge fees of as much as HKD$21,000 (\u00a31,620) and confiscate workers&apos; documents. The legal maximum is around HKD$400. They also want maximum working hours legislation and an end to the &quot;two-week rule&quot; \u2013 giving workers just a fortnight to leave Hong Kong when their employment ends \u2013 and the insistence they live with their employer. Those regulations, say activists, make it harder to leave an abusive situation \u2013 especially if helpers have large debts to repay to the agency that placed them. But even when workers speak out, officials in home and host countries turn a blind eye to problems because of migration&apos;s economic benefits, said Norma Kang Muico, Asia-Pacific migrant rights researcher for Amnesty International. &quot;Authorities disregard them because they are not voters and have no right to abode.&quot; Domestic workers are specifically excluded from legislation allowing foreign nationals to gain permanent residency after living in Hong Kong for seven years. A legal challenge to their exclusion was rejected by the special autonomous region&apos;s highest court last year. Mark Daly, the solicitor who represented the workers, said the case brought to the surface &quot;the divide between those believing in a multicultural society based on respect and dignity and those believing that you can have second-class citizens \u2026 Regrettably, Hong Kong society is slow to change attitudes and I think the HKSAR government is disappointing in this respect.&quot; Joseph Law, founder of the Hong Kong Employers of Domestic Helpers Association, accused foreign critics of failing to understand local conditions and of seeing themselves as saviours. He said he was angered by the focus being on claims of violence and insisted problems were &quot;individual and isolated&quot;. However, in a 2012 survey of 3,000 domestic workers in Hong Kong, 58% reported verbal abuse, 18% physical and 6% sexual.

They are often turgid affairs conducted in the ballrooms of hotels so identical to one another that you can&apos;t tell whether you are in Singapore or Manchester. The same speakers are there, for the most part droning on about the same thing they droned on about at the last conference. I should know, I am one of them. But occasionally, just occasionally, someone says something so radically new that it causes you sit up and actually listen. Your neighbours are no longer fiddling with their smartphones; there is the proverbial buzz in the air. This was the scene at the Materials Research Society conference in Boston last December, where a breakthrough in perovskite solar cells was announced. If perovskites mean nothing to you read on, as they may have a very big impact on your future fuel bill. If we could capture approximately 1% of the sunlight falling on to the British Isles and turn it into electricity we would meet our current energy demands. The reason no one suggests doing this rather than building wind, nuclear or conventional power stations is the cost. We currently use silicon solar cells to turn sunlight into electricity but they are expensive and require subsidies. Silicon is a poor conductor of electricity because all of its four outer electrons are bound up in the chemical bonds holding the crystal together. However, by adding a tiny amount of phosphorous, which has five outer electrons, you effectively add a free electron to the crystal and make it conduct moderately well. Similarly, you can add boron, which has only three outer electrons, and effectively do the same thing, only now the conducting charge is called an electron\u00a0hole. The magic comes when you put a phosphorous silicon layer next to a boron silicon layer: the holes and the electrons cancel each other out at the junction but create an electric field that means that electrons only like to flow in one direction across the junction. This is called a diode. There are many flavours of diodes, each having a different junction architecture. Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit light when electrons flow across the junction but the opposite effect also works: light hitting the diode creates an electric current, and this is how a solar cell works. Silicon solar cells are as intricately micro-engineered as the silicon chips in your smartphone or tablet, but instead of being the size of a postage stamp they are the size of a table. They are made in enormous billion-dollar clean-room and high-temperature fabrication facilities, which are expensive precisely because controlling the purity of the silicon and the doping levels of phosphorous and boron is not trivial. It is also energy intensive. Although prices have been coming down, fossil fuels are still so cheap it is very hard for silicon solar cells to compete. Materials scientists have been exploring other semiconductor technologies for a long while, trying to find something cheaper and better than silicon. Until recently the best bet was dye-sensitised solar cells. These have been around since the 1980s, but they have not managed to make a big impact on the energy market because, although they are cheap because they don&apos;t require billion-dollar clean-room facilities, their efficiency is generally low. This is where the new perovskite solar cells come in. There are exotic-sounding compounds, such as methylammonium trihalogen plumbates, that have a quite simple crystal structure called a perovskite. Like the dye-sensitised solar cells, these solar cells are easy and cheap to make, but they have another trick up their sleeve \u2013 they don&apos;t need a complicated diode architecture to achieve high efficiencies. Materials researchers in Oxford, led by Dr Henry Snaith, have recently shown that they can make simple perovskite solar cells with efficiencies pushing 20%. This is big news, because 20% makes them competitive with existing commercial silicon solar cells while being much cheaper to make in high volumes. They are also more suitable for incorporating into roofing materials and glass panels than silicon and so have the clear potential of being as fundamental to our city architecture as steel, concrete and asphalt. In other words, they could well be the materials that will make it possible to collect the 1% of solar energy we need as a nation, at a cost that can compete with fossil\u00a0fuels. Hearing research results such as this makes you grudgingly admit conferences are worth going to, and indeed gets you wondering whether we might look back in 10 years and pinpoint this as the time the solar energy revolution really ignited. One of my industry colleagues believes so; after the talk he immediately Skyped his research group, told them to stop what they were doing and get working on perovskite solar cells. The race to commercialise them is on."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/02/bernie-ecclestone-safe-formula-one-firm", "sentences": ["It currently holds a 35.5% stake and planned to exit in 2012 through a flotation on the Singapore stock exchange which stalled due to the eurozone crisis."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-02T17:55:34Z", "title": "Bernie Ecclestone safe for now, says Formula One firm", "tags": ["Bernie Ecclestone", "Business", "Sport"], "article": "Bernie Ecclestone will not be removed from his position as chief executive of Formula One despite facing a bribery trial during the summer, according to CVC Capital, the private equity firm that controls the sport. &quot;We don&apos;t have any changes planned at the moment,&quot; said a source close to CVC. &quot;The board constantly reviews facts and circumstances and the current position is that no changes are planned.&quot; The trial, which opens in Munich in April and is expected to last until September, has been sparked by a $44m (\u00a326m) payment by Ecclestone and his Bambino family trust to Gerhard Gribkowsky, a former executive at German bank BayernLB (BLB) who was responsible for selling the bank&apos;s 47% stake in Formula One to its current private equity owners. Prosecutors believe the payment was a bribe to steer the sale of the stake to CVC as it had agreed to retain Ecclestone as chief executive. Ecclestone recently won a related civil case in the high court in London, in which he was accused of undervaluing Formula One through the alleged bribe because other bidders may have paid more than CVC. Although Ecclestone won the case, the judge, Mr Justice Newey, ruled that &quot;the payments were a bribe \u2026 under which Dr Gribkowsky was to be rewarded for facilitating the sale of BLB&apos;s shares in the Formula One group to a buyer acceptable to Mr Ecclestone&quot;. After the judge&apos;s ruling, Ecclestone insisted it was &quot;business as usual&quot; and said he would not be stepping down despite the lack of public backing from CVC. &quot;They never say anything,&quot; he said at the time. During the case in November CVC co-founder Donald Mackenzie said: &quot;If it is proven that Mr Ecclestone has done anything that is criminally wrong, we would fire him.&quot; The source said that CVC had decided to base its decision on the outcome of the trial in Munich, rather than the high court ruling, and he believed Formula One had not been dented by the cases. &quot;People have come out of the woodwork making offers thinking that it is opportunistic to do so around this court case but the proof of the pudding is that no one has sold anything,&quot; he said. &quot;If people were running for the door you would have seen some share sales, but not one share has traded and I think people believe in the fundamental value of this business.&quot; Formula One has been one of CVC&apos;s best-performing assets and it has made a return of more than 350% in dividends and share sales from its initial $965.6m investment. It currently holds a 35.5% stake and planned to exit in 2012 through a flotation on the Singapore stock exchange which stalled due to the eurozone crisis. Ecclestone&apos;s future is the biggest question hanging over the sport: he turns 84 this year and could face a prison sentence of up to 10 years if convicted in Munich. Last year the CVC source said his successor &quot;almost certainly has to come from externally&quot;. The outgoing Sainsbury&apos;s boss, Justin King, and the football Premier League chief, Richard Scudamore, have both been rumoured as replacements. In February it emerged that the American billionaire John Malone&apos;s Liberty Media had teamed up with Discovery Communications to consider mounting a bid for Formula One. Ecclestone said: &quot;Malone is the sort of company that could buy. I can&apos;t say who are the latest people who want to but I know there isn&apos;t a sale on the cards.&quot; He added: &quot;The way CVC are structured, I think they eventually have to sell, not just this company but any company. They can only keep for a certain period.&quot; The private placement memorandum for the fund which owns CVC&apos;s Formula One stake states that the term is &quot;10 years, subject to three discretionary one-year extensions&quot;, which means that it has to dispose of the stake by 2018 at the latest."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/03/qantass-problem-has-a-better-solution-wholesale-re-nationalisation", "sentences": ["The political reality is that most Australians would be unlikely to accept Singapore Airlines, China Southern or Emirates purchasing a substantial shareholding in Qantas."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-03T03:58:24Z", "title": "Qantas's problem has a better solution: wholesale re-nationalisation", "tags": ["Qantas", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Business", "Transport policy"], "article": "Neoliberals assume that private ownership is more efficient than other forms of ownership. By the test of the market, this assumption does not hold in view of Qantas: its board and management have performed poorly compared to other international airlines, many of which are publicly owned and operated. The chickens are now coming home to roost.  We know that domestically, Qantas has been engaged in a fierce battle with Virgin (and Ansett before it) to maintain a dominant market share. Both airlines, and international carriers more broadly, have been amassing more and more aircraft. This has produced a capacity glut, pushing down ticket prices (good for passengers) and margins (bad for shareholders). Qantas and Virgin are bleeding. Virgin would be quietly confident of emerging as the last airline standing in this showdown. It should not come as any surprise that Qantas, having argued vehemently against government assistance for Ansett when the competitor was on its knees, is now asking government for a bailout. So what is to be done? Should we go for the Liberal party\u2019s favoured option of relaxing foreign ownership restrictions in the Qantas Sales Act? In a word, no.  There are compelling strategic reasons for a geographically isolated and dispersed nation such as Australia to maintain a genuinely national carrier. In 2011, we saw that a significant portion of our means of transport and commerce could be paralysed at the whim of a militant boss. Would we be comfortable with a foreign state-owned entity being able to do the same? The political reality is that most Australians would be unlikely to accept Singapore Airlines, China Southern or Emirates purchasing a substantial shareholding in Qantas. Moreover, Alan Joyce recently pointed out that Qantas has rescued endangered Australian citizens in Bali and Egypt. There is, then, a clear public good dimension to the service Qantas provides. Indeed a caring nation might even think it worthwhile to expand Qantas\u2019 services to cover medically needy but financially constrained rural citizens who require transport to urban centres, instead of relying on the admirable goodwill of a few. On the other hand, the Labor party\u2019s proposal to give Qantas a public debt guarantee shouldn\u2019t be touched with a ten foot pole. If we learned anything from the global financial crisis it should have been that throwing good money after bad and assuming private enterprises will behave responsibly with that money is socially inefficient and condones the poor performance discussed above. Let\u2019s not forget that Qantas\u2019 problems run deep: those in charge of the enterprise have failed to plan for a sustainable and innovative future. Critics point out that the operational practices and management systems of Qantas have not kept pace with international standards. Simply shedding jobs is an insufficient strategy. There are more fundamental organisational inefficiencies which lie squarely at the feet of the board and management. The optimal solution, therefore, is to re-nationalise Qantas and keep it in public hands. The most feasible re-nationalisation path would be (a) for the government to wait until Qantas\u2019 share price falls to a low enough level, and (b) to purchase an overwhelming equity stake in the enterprise. By this I mean in the range of a 90-100% stake. With the public as shareholder, the present Qantas management would be replaced with a more competent group of people. Ah, but the government is inefficient, I hear some of you cry. Well, the government hires former treasurer Peter Costello to pick winners in the share market to build the superannuation funds of the public service. He is doing a fine job. The government would likewise call for people with successful backgrounds and experience in the aviation industry to sit on the Qantas board as public servants. Contractual arrangements in which rewards are tied to performance would be imposed. At the same time, direct democratic control over major decisions in a nationalised Qantas, including the composition of the board, must be implemented. Modern communications technology makes this easy to coordinate. A core reason behind Qantas\u2019 under-performance is that the people directly affected by its operations\u2014passengers, employees, citizens\u2014are excluded from participating in the major decisions of the enterprise. These decisions are made by a private shareholder-appointed board, who have in recent times locked out employees, stranded passengers and sent jobs offshore. With a democratic vote routinely given to all stakeholders in the community on major Qantas decisions (regarding investment, technology, wages, routes and so on), more socially beneficial outcomes can be expected to be enacted. This is because the people who use and are affected by Qantas services and activities will own the results of their decisions. A democratically controlled Qantas would need to decide, for example, whether higher or lower ticket prices are more appropriate under given circumstances. In the former case, the Australian public (as shareholders) would be the beneficiaries. In the latter case, the Australian public (as passengers) would be the beneficiaries. For all its challenges, air transportation remains a booming industry that is projected to grow into the future. Of course, periodic shocks are inevitable and these have hit many airlines over the years. Like it or not, many successful airlines today are backed by governments. In this environment, the present policy settings for Qantas are not viable. A nationalised flag carrier would give all Australians the opportunity to build a brand of which we could once again be proud."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/03/china-knife-attack-police-capture-suspects-kunming", "sentences": ["Professor Rohan Gunaratna, head of the international centre for political violence and terrorism research at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the killings were the natural progression of a growing terrorist threat within Xinjiang, as perpetrators sought to increase their impact."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-03T14:05:18Z", "title": "China knife massacre: police say they have captured remaining suspects", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Chinese police have seized the remaining suspects sought for the massacre of 29 people in Kunming this weekend, state media announced on Monday. &quot;Of an eight-member group (six men, two women), four were shot dead by police at the scene, a wounded woman was arrested and the other three have been captured,&quot; said the official Xinhua news agency. It cited a statement from the Ministry of Public Security, which identified the leader of the gang as Abdurehim Kurban. Previous reports said more than 10 people were involved. No explanation of the discrepancy was given. Saturday&apos;s attacks at the city&apos;s train station also saw 143 people injured, as the assailants hacked and slashed at people apparently at random. Earlier on Monday, a state newspaper warned that China must adopt expensive and controversial measures to prevent further terrorist attacks. &quot;To guard against the terrorists from East Turkestan [Xinjiang] doing evil things, we must introduce additional measures for Chinese society outside Xinjiang. It is expensive, necessary and especially sensitive, and it will bring a series of inconveniences, and result in some controversy,&quot; said the editorial in the Global Times. It warned that Uighurs \u2013 the Turkic-speaking ethnic minority from Xinjiang \u2013 in particular should &quot;understand and tolerate some inconvenience&quot; and urged others in China to maintain harmonious relations with Uighurs, rather than playing into the hands of terrorists seeking to split society. The newspaper is state-run, although it does not represent the official voice of authorities. The piece was titled: &quot;Let East Turkestan scum suffer the state&apos;s iron fists \u2013 the more fiercely they attack, the faster they die.&quot; Xinjiang has seen repeated outbreaks of violence amid friction between authorities and members of the Uighur minority, many of whom complain that their religion and culture are suppressed. In 2009, almost 200 died in riots in the capital of the north-western region, as Uighurs attacked Han Chinese and other ethnic groups, and Han launched revenge attacks on Uighurs. So far it appears that the incident in Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, will echo previous attempts to counter Xinjiang-related violence: tougher security measures coupled with accelerated economic development. Some believe that the strategy has backfired. Yu Zhengsheng, one of the country&apos;s top leaders, told the opening session of a political advisory body in Beijing on Monday that China would boost development and industrialisation in ethnic-minority areas to increase unity and harmony, although he did not explicitly link the comments to the Kunming incident. Professor Rohan Gunaratna, head of the international centre for political violence and terrorism research at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, said the killings were the natural progression of a growing terrorist threat within Xinjiang, as perpetrators sought to increase their impact. Gunaratna said the last year had seen 200 terrorist incidents in Xinjiang. Others query that figure but agree that unrest has increased sharply. China has poured growing sums into security in Xinjiang, but Gunaratna said it needed to build a robust security and high-quality intelligence system both inside and outside the region \u2013 meaning that it should not overreact and adopt harsh measures. &quot;It&apos;s only through engagement that China can improve intelligence. [This attack] demonstrates the real need for China to work with the Uighur community, because most do not support terrorism,&quot; he said. Analysts differ on the extent to which unrest in Xinjiang is co-ordinated or arises from small groups acting individually; and to the extent of its links to overseas groups. There is particular disagreement on whether the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM)_ \u2013 frequently blamed for violence \u2013 is, or was, a significant and sophisticated organisation. But a growing number believe that foreign influences have become more important. Gunaratna suggested that political violence had become politico-religious thanks to the impact of the Taliban and al-Qaida. He argued that some attacks were caused or led by ETIM while others were inspired or instigated by the group. Nicholas Bequelin, at Human Rights Watch, suggested the upsurge in violence reflected in part the spread of information on foreign jihadist movements via the internet, offering an ideology to those who were disgruntled and disenfranchised for reasons relating to ethnicity. &quot;Radical Islam around the world is the grammar of oppression in Muslim society,&quot; he said. Li Wei, director of the anti-terrorism study centre at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, said he did not believe the motivation for the Kunming attack was religious, but political. He added that the public needed to be better educated about the escalating terrorist threat. The New York Times reported that one local police station in Nanning \u2013 the capital of Guangxi, which borders Yunnan province \u2013 urged citizens to report anyone from Xinjiang &quot;living, doing business or travelling here&quot; so officers could investigate. An officer at Xiangu police station said it was intensifying management and control but that the detention of four Uighur &quot;escaping criminals&quot; on Monday was not related to the Kunming attack."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/03/andre-agassi-international-professional-tennis-league", "sentences": ["Agassi and Pete Sampras, reunited on court in London on Monday night for an exhibition match to celebrate World Tennis Day, gave their qualified support to the IPTL, which starts in Singapore on 28 November and will be held on a home-and-away basis in four Asian cities over three weeks.", "However, Agassi&apos;s inclusion, as a past champion for the Singapore team, looks doubtful, as the competition starts in that city a day after Thanksgiving and the American had informed organisers he would not sacrifice that holiday time.", "Six or seven days away is too much of a price to pay.&quot; Owners from Singapore, Mumbai, Bangkok and Dubai gathered after the Dubai tournament final \u2013 in which Roger Federer (who is not playing in the IPTL) beat Tomas Berdych \u2013 to bid for players past and present, as well as key members of the WTA Tour."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-03T22:06:48Z", "title": "Andre Agassi refuses to give up holiday time to take part in IPTL", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "Andre Agassi"], "article": "The $24m (\u00a314.4m) International Professional Tennis League, which was launched at a player auction in Dubai on Sunday, has already run into trouble, with Andre Agassi the first to cast doubt on his participation.

The world&apos;s so-called &quot;ultra high net worth individuals&quot; \u2013 those with $30m (\u00a321m) or more in assets apart from their main home \u2013 number 167,669, according to a report from estate agents Knight Frank \u2013 up 59% over the past decade.  Roughly equal to the population of the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea \u2013 and many of them do indeed have a place there \u2013 they control more than $20tn in assets \u2013 more than the national output of the US and Germany put together.  London was home to more UHNWIs (4,224) than any other city in 2013 and this will still be the case a decade later, with nearly 5,000 expected to be living there, according to the report.  Singapore and New York will leapfrog Tokyo and Hong Kong to take second and third places. The top six cities have more UHNWIs living in them than Latin America and the Middle East combined. Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said the cluster of businesses, international appeal, heritage and democratic institutions in London and New York are not easy to replicate. But, he said, &quot;London wins over New York: It&apos;s more diverse. There are more nationalities living here and it&apos;s a more global city.&quot; Britain is the number one destination for those seeking a new domicile, although the US is still more popular with the Asian wealth elite. Russia has seen an outflow of ultra-rich individuals to places like London, New York and Dubai.  Pippa Malmgren, ex-economic adviser to George Bush, said: &quot;I would argue that the UK has now emerged as the world&apos;s most attractive residence for non-domiciles. The crackdown on tax havens in Switzerland has removed these old options for new capital. As a result, there has been a huge influx of global capital into the UK \u2013 and this is reflected in many things, including property prices.&quot; In coming decades both London and New York could be eclipsed by Asian cities, where luxury property markets are booming.  The numbers of super-rich are forecast to double in Africa and India in the next decade. In China the ranks of the ultra-wealthy will soar by 80%. Bailey said: &quot;History, location and their long established wealth mean London and New York&apos;s positions look unassailable, at least for now. It is further down our leader board that the real city wars are being waged. The main battleground is Asia, where a handful of locations are slugging it out in the hope of establishing a clear lead as the region&apos;s alpha urban hub.&quot; Asian cities, led by Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, experienced the fastest growth in property prices last year, but some of the cities affected by the 2008 downturn \u2013 such as Dublin, where prime property soared 17.5% last year \u2013 are now on the road to recovery.  As well as swanky estate agents and yacht builders, all this is music to the ears of the big jewellers, auction houses and most prestigious wine estates. The ultra-rich like to spend their wealth on jewellery, especially in emerging markets, followed by art, watches, wine and cars, a survey for the report found.  Bailey said space travel and asteroid mining were hot investments, with 70 billionaires putting money into space or sub-orbital flights. Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic plans its first space flight this year, holds out the prospect of travelling from London to Sydney in a couple of hours \u2013 allowing Chinese or Indian investors to pop over to their Tuscan farmhouse on a whim.  How they spend it Superyachts and private jetsSuperyachts \u2013 defined as those longer than 60 metres \u2013 and private jets are the preserve of the seriously rich and last April saw the launch of the world&apos;s biggest, the 180-metre Azzam. With a reputed price tag of \u00a3400m, it is widely understood to have been built for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emir of Abu Dhabi. The market for smaller yachts is only just returning to normal. Private jet sales also bounced back in the second half of 2013.  Luxury brandsBoston Consulting Group calculated earlier this year that the world&apos;s wealthiest spent \u00a31.1tn on luxury goods and services. Very little of that money would have been spent in Africa but the continent is expected to see the greatest growth in spending, along with the Middle East. Growth in luxury brand outlets is slowing in Asia, as the Chinese government cracks down on conspicuous consumption and many rich residents shop abroad.  Rare stamps and coinsCoins are becoming more popular in China, India and Russia. Gold Roman coins are particularly sought after. A 1794 US &quot;Flowing Hair Silver Dollar&quot; fetched a record $10m at auction in New York a year ago. Rare stamp values are also rising: The Stanley Gibbons China 200 rare stamp index climbed 36% between 2011 and 2012. Classic carsClassic car values are up 28% over the past 12 months, according to the Historic Automobile Group&apos;s Top Index. Not only the most famous marques are doing well: one of the biggest movers last year was Japan&apos;s first supercar, a Toyota 2000 GT from the late 1960s. Jewellery and artGold prices are falling, but the best untreated stones \u2013 particularly &apos;fancy&apos; diamonds and other coloured stones \u2013 are fetching record sums. Natural saltwater pearls, amber, coral and jade are also in demand. Contemporary and postwar works set new records last year, according to Art Market research: Francis Bacon&apos;s Three Studies of Lucian Freud sold for $143m at Christies in New York in October \u2013 a record for any artwork. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 6 March 2014 to clarify that it is the Chinese government which has been cracking down on conspicuous consumption."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/mar/06/apple-moved-89bn-in-profits-from-australia-to-ireland-report-says", "sentences": ["Apple reported pre-tax earnings in Australia that totalled just $88.5m last year, but sent $2bn of income to Ireland via Singapore in the same period, according to the AFR."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-06T06:05:54Z", "title": "Apple moved $8.9bn in profits from Australia to Ireland, report says", "tags": ["Apple", "Australia news", "Tax avoidance"], "article": "Apple has reportedly moved $8.9bn in profits from Australia to Ireland in the past 10 years, sparking renewed calls to curb corporate tax avoidance.

Apple reported pre-tax earnings in Australia that totalled just $88.5m last year, but sent $2bn of income to Ireland via Singapore in the same period, according to the AFR.  The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the federal government had not been doing enough to counter tax avoidance, after the Coalition announced it would not be supporting the closure of some loopholes in the banking regime. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair to other Australian businesses that do pay their fair share of tax if some companies are able to shift profits around to avoid tax,\u201d he said on Thursday.

She lives in a converted storage room on the sixth floor of her landlord&apos;s building, close to the Champs Elys\u00e9es. The room, which has a sink, measures less than 5 square metres and costs Sophia \u20ac350 (\u00a3290) per month, or \u20ac70 per square metre. There used to be a kitchen in the corridor, until her landlords ripped it out after trying to force her to leave. &quot;One night I came home to find they had used a lock I don&apos;t have the key for. I had to call a locksmith to open my home, which cost \u20ac400. So I didn&apos;t have enough to pay my rent the next month.&quot; Sophia is unable to find alternative lodgings due to her modest revenue. &quot;If I could leave, I would \u2013 trust me, I have looked. When I first arrived, I thought these small, expensive spaces were the norm in Paris. It&apos;s only when I brought a friend here one day and he explained it is illegal to rent out this sized room that I realised I was being abused.&quot; The housing crisis in Paris dates back more than a century to the golden years of the belle \u00e9poque \u2013 when the city could not grow fast enough to satisfy a population finally freed from the cares of war and revolution. But according to the Economist Intelligence Unit&apos;s latest cost-of-living report, Paris is now the second most expensive city in the world after Singapore. The price of rented accommodation is so inaccessible that many workers on modest pay are having to take up illegal and substandard rooms rented out by modern-day marchands de sommeil, or &quot;sleep vendors&quot; (the term originally described those who rented beds by the hour to 1950s workers in shantytowns on the outskirts of Paris). Last year, housing action group La Fondation Abb\u00e9 Pierre (FAP) uncovered the case of Dominique \u2013 a now 50-year-old temporary worker who had spent the past 15 years living in a tiny former chambre de bonne (maid&apos;s attic room) that measured just 1.56m x 1.56m. One of many such rooms being rented out illegally, Dominique paid a monthly rate of \u20ac330 (\u00a3271). He had no access to a shower or toilet, just a sink in his room. &quot;We didn&apos;t live, we survived,&quot; he told French radio station RTL. &quot;But we ended up saying it&apos;s either that or living out on the streets.&quot; Prior to Dominique renting the room, it had been on the books of three different estate agencies.\u00a0He has taken legal action to claim back the 15 years&apos; rent from his landlady. &quot;Dominique should be compensated for the abuse he has suffered; the rent should be reimbursed in full because his vulnerability was abused \u2013 but also it is necessary to make an example of the landlady,&quot; said FAP&apos;s chief executive officer, Patrick Doutreligne. &quot;Even prison cells aren&apos;t as bad as some of these lodgings.&quot; The final verdict is due on 24 March. Under French law, to be deemed fit for habitation, a living space needs to be a minimum of 9 square metres and 1.80m in height, and possess adequate heating, running water, electricity and access to a bathroom, shower and kitchen. Many landlords, however, are still renting out converted cupboards, garages, cellars or chambres de bonne. The FAP estimates one-fifth of all housing issues it deals with concern illegally small accommodation, and that more than 3.5 million people across the country are living in unacceptable accommodation. Doutreligne describes it as &quot;a serious abuse of the poor in renting out these sorts of places on a permanent basis. These illegal lodgings must be reported and landlords sanctioned if we want to protect human dignity&quot;. In France there are a great many obstacles to renting a place. The tenant must earn three to four times the rent; they must provide pay slips, references, work contracts, identity papers, bank account details and tax declarations; and all are required to have a guarantor. But above all, excessive demand plus various gentrification projects are causing property prices to sky-rocket (buying an apartment in Paris now costs an average of \u20ac8,000 (\u00a36,600) per square metre). &quot;If a place costs more than \u20ac30 per square metre to rent per month, it&apos;s too much,&quot; said Jean-Baptiste Eyraud, founder of housing rights association DAL (Droit au Logement). Penalities in the form of taxes and fines are in place for landlords who rent rooms illegally, but they are easily evaded according to Eyraud.     This tiny rented room in Paris is an example of the cramped conditions many people live in. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    Looking through properties to rent on France&apos;s three biggest online accommodation websites, it does not take long to find illegal rooms. One landlord was offering his 7.5 square metre room for rent at \u20ac420 (\u00a3346) per month, or \u20ac46 per square metre. Another lodging, advertised by an estate agent, was a chambre de bonne,\u00a0supposedly of 9 square metres, located on the seventh floor of a decrepit building\u00a0in the upmarket 17th\u00a0district of Paris. Without an elevator and with shared toilets, it was on the market for \u20ac380 (\u00a3312) per month. When I measured the room, it was just over 5 square metres. Claiming he had already climbed the seven floors that morning, the agent handed me the keys and told me to have a look at the room unaccompanied while he waited downstairs. When I finally reached the top floor, the\u00a0long corridor\u00a0was filthy with dust that looked like it had accumulated over several months. The room, equally grimy, was shockingly small. When the sofa bed was unfolded, it left hardly any room to move around. A narrow shower cubicle had been fitted besides the sofa \u2013 one could only imagine the humidity in the room after showering.\u00a0&quot;It&apos;s a small room, but it&apos;s just perfect for a student because it has everything you need,&quot; said the agent when I returned the keys. I also met Aissatou, originally from Guinea, who lives in a ground-floor 25 square metre space, without double-glazing and minimal heating for \u00a3585 (\u20ac710) per month with her three boys, aged three, six and nine \u2013 whose puffy faces confirm their suffering health from the humidity due to the exterior walls being dampened every time it rains. Aissatou sleeps in a bed with her three-year-old, while the two older boys sleep in bunk beds in the same room. The conditions are cramped. &quot;I don&apos;t understand why we end up having to settle for this sort of accommodation when we work,&quot; said Aissatou. &quot;The hygiene commission has judged that the landlord needs to renovate the space, but instead he&apos;s kicking us out. My work contract has ended and we have nowhere else to go.&quot; According to the FAP&apos;s study, there are currently 800,000 severely overpopulated lodgings in Paris that are unfit for living. Aissatou&apos;s application for council housing was finally accepted in January, but she isn&apos;t confident. &quot;I know people with &apos;urgent&apos; applications that have been waiting for eight years. They told me I&apos;m registered as an urgent case and but that it could take up to six months, but even six months is too long for an &apos;urgent&apos; situation. If a single mother and three growing children isn&apos;t one of the most urgent cases, then what is?&quot; &quot;The government is breaking the 2007 Dalo law by not placing the vulnerable in decent housing,&quot; said Eyraud. &quot;They [the Paris council] could re-house people in private housing \u2013 housing that is left empty \u2013 but they don&apos;t because it costs them too much,&quot; said Eyraud. Last January, the Guardian revealed that 11m homes across Europe are empty, 2.4m of which are in France. Following the FAP&apos;s 19th report released in January, the housing minister, C\u00e9cile Duflot, announced that &quot;2014 will be the year of the realisation of a real action plan in favour of people recognised as a priority by the Dalo law&quot;. Currently, 57,000 families living in vulnerable conditions are registered for priority housing.     A computer image of a Roland Castro's vision for a greener Paris in La Courneuve.

Search and rescue teams from Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore were scouring waters south of Vietnam for traces of flight MH370, more than 12 hours after it lost contact. Ships and aircraft from China and the Philippines were also on their way to help. Two infants were among the 227 passengers, more than 150 of whom were Chinese nationals. Twelve crew were on board. The other travellers included 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, and six Australians as well as passengers from India, France, the US, New Zealand, Ukraine, Canada, Russia, Italy, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Austria. The Boeing 777-200ER left Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am on Saturday (6.41pm GMT) and was last detected somewhere between 20 minutes and two hours into its flight. Vietnamese media reported an admiral as saying that the plane &quot;could have&quot; crashed in Vietnamese maritime territory, but Malaysia&apos;s acting transport minister denied reports that it had been found south of a Vietnamese island.

We are doing everything we can to ensure every possible angle has been addressed,&quot; Hishamuddin Hussein told reporters near Kuala Lumpur International airport. He said the Malaysian military was awaiting information from Vietnamese counterparts. Malaysian naval vessels saw no immediate sign of wreckage when they reached the area off the country&apos;s north-east coast where the flight last made contact, a senior rescue official told Reuters. China&apos;s state news agency, Xinhua, said President Xi Jinping had urged officials to strengthen contacts with their counterparts in Malaysia and other countries and take all necessary measures for any emergency treatment needed. He had also ordered the Ministry of Transportation and the Civil Aviation Administration to enhance security checks to ensure the &quot;absolute safety&quot; of domestic operations. &quot;We are extremely worried,&quot; China&apos;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told reporters in Beijing. &quot;The news is very disturbing.&quot; Fuad Sharuji, Malaysia Airlines&apos; vice-president of operations control, told CNN the plane had been flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet (10,670 metres) and that the pilots had reported no problems. Analysts said it was highly unusual to lose a flight without any previous indication it was experiencing difficulties \u2013 although an Air France flight that crashed into the South Atlantic in 2009, killing all 228 people on board, had never issued a distress call. The plane is a Boeing 777-200, which aviation experts said has a strong safety record. One crash-landed in San Francisco in July last year, killing three passengers and injuring more than 180, but the crash investigation, which is ongoing, has so far indicated no mechanical failure and focused on the pilots&apos; failure to recognise that the plane was flying too low and too slow as it approached the runway. Boeing said via Twitter that its thoughts were with all on board and their families. Malaysia Airlines is also regarded as having a strong safety record. Its last major incident was in 1995, when 34 people died after a plane crashed in the Malaysian city of Tawau. The flight was operating as a China Southern Airlines codeshare. In a statement on Saturday afternoon, Malaysia Airlines wrote: &quot;We are currently working with international authorities on the search and rescue mission and as at 1400 hours, 08 March 2014, we have no information on the location of the airline. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with all passengers, our crew and their family members.&quot;     This screengrab from flightradar24, a flight tracker that shows live air traffic from around the world, shows the last reported position of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 Photograph: AP    Confusion surrounds the point at which the flight lost contact. In a statement, Malaysian Airlines&apos; chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said it was in contact with air traffic controllers until around two hours into the flight, at a point 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu. Other sources suggested that was an error. Flight tracking website FlightAware showed the plane flying north-east over Malaysia after takeoff and climbing to 35,000ft. The flight vanished from the website&apos;s tracking records a minute later, 20 minutes after it took off. Twenty minutes after that, while flying over the sea between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh city, the plane failed to check in as scheduled, an official at the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) said. In a separate statement, Lieutenant General Vo Van Tuan, deputy chief of staff of the Vietnamese army, said the flight &quot;lost all contact and radar signal one minute before it entered Vietnam&apos;s air traffic control&quot;. Pham Hien, a Vietnamese search and rescue official, said the last signal was detected 120 nautical miles south-west of Vietnam&apos;s Ca Mau province, close to where the South China Sea meets the Gulf of Thailand. The black boxes on planes are equipped with electronic beacons that emit ultrasonic signals detectable underwater and can, in the right conditions, be detected from hundreds of miles away. But if trapped deep inside wreckage or an underwater trench, the effectiveness can be hindered. Australia&apos;s Department of Foreign Affairs has said it &quot;fears the worst&quot; and has contacted the family members of the Australians on board. By 10.30am, four hours after the plane was due to arrive, most people waiting for it at Beijing International airport had left. The arrivals board still listed the flight.     Relatives of passengers on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 arrive at the Family Friend reception centre at Kuala Lumpur International airport. Photograph: Ahmad Yusni/EPA    A whiteboard next to an information booth offered waiting families transportation to a nearby hotel, where they were promised more information. By late afternoon, many relatives had been waiting for hours in a hotel ballroom guarded by police. Those contacted by Chinese media said they had not been given any updates. ABC News reported that some relatives screamed in frustration that they had not been able to speak to an airline official. One sobbing woman, who had gone to meet her brother, told ABC that airline officials initially told her the flight had not taken off when she asked about its non-arrival. Several of the Chinese passengers are thought to have been returning from an art exhibition in Kuala Lumpur. In Kuala Lumpur, more family members gathered at the airport. Malaysia Airlines has named the captain as Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old Malaysian with 18,000 hours of flying on his log book after 23 years with the company.

It\u2019s made of an eclectic assortment of ingredients including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 pineapple chunks, deep-fried tofu, bean sprouts and raw onion, tossed together with sweet sauce. But rojak also stands for a distinctly Singaporean idea of community, one that\u2019s different from the American melting pot. In Singapore, things don\u2019t blend into one \u2013  they\u2019re mixed, and each ingredient retains its distinctiveness.   Perhaps this is why Singapore\u2019s bi-lingual language policy \u2013 each person learns at least two languages (one is English) at school from the age of six \u2013 allows for true diversity. During primary school, my class did everything together, except when it came to these second-language sessions. We would pick up our bags and split up into Chinese, Malay and Tamil groups. I studied Chinese (which meant Mandarin), and in secondary school added German to the list, neither of which were languages I could have learned at home. Singapore is a cacophony, with new sounds every which way. New York is supposed to sound that way, too, but when I arrived, I was mainly hearing English in a wide variety of accents. And traveling further across the US, I realized even accents were a measure of diversity.  I wouldn\u2019t claim that Singapore\u2019s system has no problems \u2013 there could be more of a choice as to which second language we learn. At the moment, one is assigned to you along ethnic lines, which can get complicated if you\u2019re mixed race like me or if you\u2019re Chinese but your mother\u2019s native tongue is Cantonese. Still, the result is a linguistically diverse population, and a daily collage of words: announcements in the four official languages on the train, English for official documents, Chinese when ordering at the food court and the National Anthem in Malay.  We\u2019d be unlikely to see a backlash to a commercial like the recent Superbowl Coca Cola spot, in which \u2018America the Beautiful\u2019 was sung in a number of languages, a wonderful testament to the diversity of the nation. Or so I thought. To be fair, that was by and large the public reaction, but a significant vocal minority let rip on the internet with a startling amount of vitriol. Perhaps it\u2019s not that startling to anyone who\u2019s ever read a comments thread. Still, even amongst the welcome-to-America-now-speak-English tweets, people said things that have made my jaw drop. My favorite so far: \u201cCoca Cola is the official soft drink of illegals crossing the border.\u201d This uniquely American vitriol isn\u2019t just a question of linguistic ability. It\u2019s a symptom of a profound lack of interest in other cultures: speaking \u2018foreign\u2019 languages becomes something strange people do in faraway places. Various studies have determined that only about 3% of published work in the US is translated, which means 97% of all reading matter comes from the English-speaking world. Given that only about one in three Americans speak a second language with any fluency, this leaves a great deal of the world\u2019s culture inaccessible to the bulk of the country.  America is justly proud of the richness and diversity of its people, but it\u2019s a pity this isn\u2019t better reflected in the languages spoken here. The country seems ripe for a Singapore-style bilingual or trilingual education system. This happens in some places, but is often elective, and starts too late. The malleable mind of a young child is a sponge for languages, and it\u2019s a missed opportunity not to teach every elementary schooler a second language they\u2019ll be able to pick up with tremendous ease, compared to how difficult learning a language can become as you grow older.   I\u2019m not saying America should become less of a melting pot. But it could learn a thing or two from Singapore\u2019s rojak."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/08/malaysia-airlines-vigil-missing-plane", "sentences": ["Singapore joined Vietnamese and Malaysian teams in the search; China, too, dispatched search and rescue vessels, as did the Philippines."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-08T19:43:33Z", "title": "Malaysia Airlines: a flood of tears at the vigil for missing flight", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "Vietnam", "China", "Air transport", "Airline industry", "World news"], "article": "It was 12.41am on Saturday \u2013 just six minutes later than scheduled \u2013 when flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and climbed steadily into the clear skies, bound north-eastwards for China. A few minutes earlier, the 227 passengers had been settling into their seats aboard the Boeing 777 as the 12-strong crew prepared for departure. One young man made a last-minute call telling his sister he was on board and that he would see her at the airport in Beijing. A Malaysian couple were anticipated their holiday, a longed-for break after the anguish of a miscarriage. A Chinese father had his own vacation plans but was coming home from work one day early so that he had time to take his child to the dentist. Flight data shows the plane rising steadily to a cruising altitude of 35,000ft as it flew across Malaysia and over the Gulf of Thailand towards Vietnam. But six hours later, as friends and relatives in Beijing airport waited to greet the passengers, a single line in red topped the arrivals board. Above the yellow rows of anticipated flights and blue rows of newly landed planes ran the words: MH370 \u2013Kuala Lumpur \u2013 6.30am \u2013 Delayed. Malaysian Airlines announced it had lost all contact with the plane. And as night fell over the South China Sea, ships and aircraft from five nations would still be scouring thousands of square miles of ocean for any trace of it. One possible sighting perhaps confirmed what those waiting had feared all day: one, possibly two, oil slicks near the area where the plane was last detected. Reports \u2013 even from official sources \u2013 offer contradictory accounts as to when concerns first emerged. What is certain is that the plane vanished not long into the five-and-a-half-hour flight, hours before the alarm was raised publicly. The most dangerous points for a flight are takeoff and landing. The airline reported that it had lost contact two hours after departure, with the plane at cruising altitude. Whatever happened to MH370 happened quickly: no distress signals were emitted and there was no other indication of difficulties. Other sources suggest the problems set in much earlier than the airline has indicated. Online flight data for the plane halts abruptly around 20 or 40 minutes into the flight. Vietnamese aviation officials say it was due to check in with them 40 minutes after takeoff, but never did so. Its last recorded position \u2013 according to co-ordinates from the Malaysian government \u2013 was 120 nautical miles north-east of Kota Bharu, close to where the Gulf of Thailand meets the South China Sea. Malaysia Airlines has one of the best safety records in the region; its last fatal incident was in 1995, when 34 people died in a domestic crash. Similarly, Boeing 777s have been praised by analysts for their impressive performance \u2013 unblemished by a single fatality until last year&apos;s crash at San Francisco airport, which claimed three lives. The captain of the flight was Zaharie Ahmad Shah, a 53-year-old Malaysian with 18,000 hours&apos; flying on his logbook after 23 years with the airline. Despite that substantial record, flying seems to have been a passion as well as a career; a Zaharie Ahmad Shah posted on several forums for flight simulation enthusiasts, on one occasion mentioning his employer as Malaysia Airlines. The first officer, Fariq Hamid, was half Shah&apos;s age but had amassed 2,750 hours of experience since joining the airline in 2007. The 10 other members of the flight crew were also Malaysian. But their passengers \u2013 the youngest aged two, the eldest 79 \u2013 came from 14 nations. More than 150 were Chinese; they included artists and their families, returning from a calligraphy exhibition in Kuala Lumpur. Another 38 were Malaysian. There were several Indonesians, Australians, Indians, French and US passengers on board, as well as people from other parts of Asia and Europe. Two of their number, however, remain mysterious. The passenger manifest lists a 37-year-old Italian man named Luigi Maraldi. But Italian authorities said his passport was stolen in Thailand some time ago; although it was replaced, he was not aboard the plane. &quot;Mr Maraldi is now in Phuket, but somebody who used his passport died on the flight. It is something we don&apos;t understand,&quot; said Dr Francesco Pensato, Italy&apos;s honorary consul in Phuket, where Maraldi lives. He noted that it was possible there might be another person with the same name and date of birth. Shortly afterwards, the Austrian press agency said its foreign ministry had announced that an Austrian national listed on the flight was also safe and well. His passport had also been stolen in Thailand. It is too early to know what connection, if any, the two unknown passengers have to the flight&apos;s disappearance. As the hours ticked by at Terminal 3 of Beijing airport, concerns grew among waiting friends and relatives. One told reporters that when she first asked about the non-arrival of the flight, an airline employee told her it had never taken off. By mid-morning, a taciturn official had scrawled a notice on a whiteboard, telling family members that transport was provided to take them to a nearby hotel. &quot;They want us to go to the hotel; it cannot be good,&quot; a woman said into her mobile phone as she wept. Relatives waited in a conference room for hours, without news, while rumours circulated. China&apos;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told a press conference that the disappearance was &quot;very disturbing&quot;. The cruellest speculation was a rumour that the plane had made a successful emergency landing at Nanning airport in southern China. In the hours of confusion, Malaysian Airlines and officials said they were looking into the story; it was simply untrue. As the day wore on, and hope as well as patience was stretched thin, relatives complained that no one was helping them. &quot;There&apos;s no one from the company here; we can&apos;t find a single person,&quot; one man told Reuters. &quot;They have just shut us in this room and told us to wait.&quot; Malaysia Airlines, which was posting regular statements online, tweeted as the volume of complaints rose: &quot;We understand everyone&apos;s concern on MH370 pax &amp; crew. We&apos;re accelerating every effort with all relevant authorities to locate the aircraft.&quot; In Kuala Lumpur, officials asked relatives to bring their documents to the airport, ready to board evening flights to Vietnam. Meanwhile, the rescue operation was swinging into action. Tensions have run high in the area in recent years, thanks to a multi-party dispute over much of the South China Sea. This time, however, neighbouring countries were drawing together to co-operate. Singapore joined Vietnamese and Malaysian teams in the search; China, too, dispatched search and rescue vessels, as did the Philippines. The US told Malaysia it would send extra support. In the last hours of daylight, Vietnamese officials said that its air force had spotted one, perhaps two, oil slicks off the southern tip of the country, each between 10 and 15km long, and consistent with the kinds that would be produced by the fuel tanks from a crashed jetliner. Malaysian officials said it was too soon to speculate on the fate of the craft. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are missing on flight MH370,&quot; said Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak. &quot;Today all Malaysians stand in solidarity with those on flight MH370 and their loved ones.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/08/whats-new-f1-2014", "sentences": ["2014 race calendar 16 Mar Australia (Melbourne) 30 Mar Malaysia (Sepang) 6 Apr Bahrain (Sakhir) 20 Apr China (Shanghai) 11 May Spain (Barcelona) 25 May Monaco 8 Jun Canada (Montreal) 22 Jun Austria (Red Bull Ring) 6 Jul Britain (Silverstone) 20 Jul Germany (Hockenheim) 27 Jul Hungary (Budapest) 24 Aug Belgium (Spa-Francorchamps) 7 Sep Italy (Monza) 21 Sep Singapore 5 Oct Japan (Suzuka) 12 Oct Russia (Sochi) 2 Nov United States (Austin) 9 Nov Brazil (Interlagos) 23 Nov Abu Dhabi (Yas Marina)"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-08T22:00:01Z", "title": "What's new in F1 for 2014?

POWERTRAINS What used to be called an engine but is now a combined group of components. The major element is still the engine with the 2.4-litre V8 replaced by a turbo-charged and quieter 1.6-litre V6. It combines with the new Energy Recovery System. Similar in concept to last year&apos;s Kers, the ERS harnesses energy under braking and from the turbo to deliver a larger and longer return. Making the package work is key in 2014. Mercedes seem to have it cracked with Ferrari not too far behind but Renault are desperately struggling. 2. FUEL LIMITATIONS Likely to be second only to engine performance in importance for the new season and intrinsically linked due to the increased energy return from ERS, the weight of fuel to be carried has dropped from 150kg to 100kg. It is enough to make it to the chequered flag but will require careful management in-race, with drivers having to adapt their strategy while racing to ensure best performance. 3. DOUBLE POINTS Unloved, unwanted and unnecessary. The decision to award double points in the final race was derided by drivers and greeted with anger by fans, rightly suggesting it was a facile ploy that devalued the rest of the season. Nonetheless, in an embarrassing bid to try to make the season go to the wire, 50 points will be on offer in Abu Dhabi. 4.

The 21-year-old was already part of the McLaren family in their young driver programme. He&apos;s quick and is a Formula Renault champion but the team will not only measure him on track; the importance of in-season development means technical feedback will be key.

Investigators are examining the entire passenger manifest after European diplomats said late on Saturday that two of the 227 passengers were travelling on stolen passports. Hishamuddin Hussein, who is also defence minister, said Malaysia would work with the FBI and other international agencies and that two more names were being checked.  \u201cAll the four names are with me,\u201d he said, according to Reuters. He spoke as the multinational hunt for any sign of the Malaysia Airlines flight missing with 239 people on board widened on Sunday, with officials saying search and rescue teams had so far found no trace of it. Hishammuddin also said there was a chance the aircraft had turned back in mid-air. \u201cWe are looking at the possibility of an aircraft air turn back, in which case different locations will have to be identified,\u201d he said. Citizens from 14 nations were on board, though the vast majority were Chinese. The 12-strong flight crew were all from Malaysia. On Saturday night, diplomats confirmed that two Europeans listed on the passenger manifest \u2013 an Italian, Luigi Maraldi and an Austrian, Christian Kozel \u2013 had not been on the flight and were safe and well. Maraldi had his passport stolen in Thailand last year and Kozel\u2019s was stolen in the region two years ago. The flight was a codeshare with China Southern and the two people named as Maraldi and Kozel on the list booked together via the Chinese airline, Chinese media reported.  The company said it had CCTV footage of the two people who checked in as Maraldi and Kozel. The Boeing 777 disappeared from radar screens just 40 minutes into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in the early hours of Saturday morning. It was last detected over the seas between Malaysia and Vietnam. On Sunday morning the Malaysian director-general of civil aviation, Azaruddin Abdul Rahman, told reporters the search had expanded to a larger area of the South China Sea area and west coast of Malaysia, the Straits Times reported. Warships from Singapore and China were heading to the area and the United States also offered vessels and aircraft. In a statement issued on Sunday morning, Malaysia Airlines said: \u201cMore than 24 hours after the loss of contact with Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, the search and rescue teams are still unable to detect the whereabouts of the missing aircraft. \u201cIn fearing for the worst, a disaster recovery management specialist from Atlanta, USA will be assisting Malaysia Airlines in this crucial time.\u201d An earlier statement began with the words: \u201cMalaysia Airlines humbly asks all Malaysians and people around the world to pray for flight MH370.\u201d Vietnam\u2019s deputy transport minister, Pham Quy Tieu, said no wreckage had been seen in the vicinity of two oil slicks detected late on Saturday, but that the search continued. The pilot of another flight told a Malaysian newspaper he had made brief contact with the plane via his emergency frequency, at the request of Vietnamese aviation authorities who had been unable to reach it as expected. Vietnam has said it believes the flight never entered its airspace. The unnamed man said his Japan-bound plane was deep into Vietnamese airspace when officials asked him to relay to MH370 to establish its position, and that he succeeded at about 1.30am local time.  \u201cThe voice on the other side could have been either Captain Zaharie [Ahmad Shah, 53,] or Fariq [Abdul Hamid, 27], but I was sure it was the co-pilot. \u201cThere were a lot of interference ... static ... but I heard mumbling from the other end. \u201cThat was the last time we heard from them, as we lost the connection,\u201d he told the New Straits Times. He said he did not think any more of it at the time, as losing connections was common. Malaysia Airlines executives have said the flight was at 35,000 feet when it vanished and had given no indication of problems when last in contact.

Transport and defence minister Hishamuddin Hussein said officials were considering all possible explanations for the disappearance of flight MH370, adding: &quot;We cannot jump the gun. Our focus now is to find the plane.&quot; The airline warned families to prepare for the worst as the search widened amid inconclusive reports that debris had been spotted floating in the sea between Vietnam and Malaysia. At least two people on the plane were travelling together on stolen passports, fuelling concerns about the Boeing-777&apos;s abrupt disappearance in the early hours of Saturday. However, experts said there were many possible reasons for why it vanished and for people to travel on false documents. Malaysian officials said they were looking at four suspect identities and were examining the entire passenger manifest. Interpol confirmed that at least two passports were listed in its database as stolen and that it was examining other documents. The international police agency&apos;s secretary general, Ronald Noble, said it had spent years urging countries to screen all passports systematically. &quot;Now, we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists, while Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries worldwide are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights,&quot; he said. Two-thirds of the travellers were Chinese, while the rest were from elsewhere in Asia, North America and Europe. The vast search area in the seas between Malaysia and Vietnam expanded further on Sunday because of the plane&apos;s apparent turn off course. At least 40 ships and 22 aircraft from Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, China and the United States are participating in the hunt.     The head of the MMEA, Mohd Amdan Kurish, left, checks a radar during the search for the missing plane. Photograph: AP    The director general of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said it had sent a patrol ship to gather samples from an oil slick to determine whether the oil came from the flight or a passing ship, the government-backed Bernama website reported. No debris was found nearby. The Beijing-bound Boeing-777 had reached cruising altitude when it disappeared from radar screens around 40 minutes after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.40am on Saturday. Both the airline and the aircraft model have strong safety records. The weather was generally good and the plane did not issue a distress signal. Malaysia&apos;s air force chief Rodzali Daud told a press conference that it appeared to have gone off-route. &quot;We are trying to make sense of this \u2026 The military radar indicated that the aircraft may have made a turn back and in some parts, this was corroborated by civilian radar,&quot; he said. The chief executive of Malaysia Airlines, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said the plane had not informed the airline and air traffic control authorities of its change of course, as it was supposed to do in such circumstances. The pilot of another flight told a Malaysian newspaper he had made brief contact with the plane via his emergency frequency at the request of Vietnamese aviation authorities who were expecting it to enter their airspace but had been unable to reach it. The unnamed man said he was deep into Vietnamese airspace when officials asked him to relay to MH370 to establish its position, and that he succeeded at around 1.30am \u2013 around 10 minutes after the last recorded flight data. &quot;There [was] a lot of interference \u2026 static \u2026 but I heard mumbling from the other end,&quot; he said, adding that he believed the voice belonged to the co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid. He then lost the connection, he told the New Straits Times. An airline pilot who flew within 100 nautical miles of the route 12 hours before the Malaysia Airline flight disappeared said there were large thunderstorms in the area, with some turbulence, but the weather did not appear to pose serious problems for commercial flights. While the circumstances of the plane&apos;s disappearance are extremely unusual, an Air France flight vanished without warning over the South Atlantic in 2009; investigators blamed that crash on a combination of technical problems and pilot error. Experts also cautioned that there were various reasons why people could be on board with invalid documents. In 2010, when an Air India Express flight overshot the runway at Mangalore, killing 160, it emerged that 10 of those on board had fraudulent passports. One US Department of Homeland Security official told the Los Angeles Times: &quot;Just because they were stolen doesn&apos;t mean the travellers were terrorists.&quot;     Vietnamese air force crew prepare to head out from Tan Son Nhat airport to search for the Malaysian airliner. Photograph: AP    The passengers, using the names Luigi Maraldi and Christian Kozel, bought consecutive tickets on 6 March from China Southern, which had a codeshare agreement for the flight, paying in Thai baht. They were booked together to Beijing, where they would have had a stopover of just over 10 hours before travelling onwards to Amsterdam. &quot;Maraldi&quot; was then booked to fly to Copenhagen while &quot;Kozel&quot; was booked on a flight to Frankfurt. Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, Malaysia&apos;s civil aviation chief, told a press conference investigators were looking at CCTV footage of the individuals on those passports &quot;from check-in to departure&quot;. The real Maraldi and Kozel \u2013 Italian and Austrian nationals respectively \u2013 had previously reported their passports stolen in the region. Maraldi told a Thai website he lost his in a deal that went wrong at a motorcycle rental shop in Phuket. The Malaysian transport and defence minister Hishammuddin Hussein said authorities were looking at two more possible cases of suspicious identities. &quot;All the four names are with me and have been given to our intelligence agencies,&quot; he said. &quot;We are looking at all possibilities.&quot; No information has been issued on the other cases under review. Chinese state media reported that one of the passport numbers reported on the manifest belonged to a man from Fujian, eastern China, who was safe and well. But his name was not that listed alongside the number, which according to the manifest belonged to another Chinese man. The man told police his passport had not been lost or stolen. An FBI team is on its way to assist the investigation because three Americans were on board. Experts from the National Transportation Safety Board \u2013 which investigates all US domestic civil aviation crashes \u2013 the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing are also flying to the region, the NTSB said in a statement. The CEO of a Malaysia Airlines subsidiary told reporters the plane was last inspected 10 days ago and found to be &quot;in proper condition&quot;.

Luigi Maraldi, 37, said he was on holiday last summer when he left his passport at an undisclosed rental shop in Patong, the resort island&apos;s tourist centre, only to discover when he later went to collect it that the shop owner had handed it over to a man who &quot;looked similar&quot;. Passports are often asked in exchange for car and motorbike rentals in Phuket \u2013 visited by 12 million tourists every year \u2013 but the island is a hotbed of identity theft, and complaints of stolen and lost passports are rife. According to Italian honorary consul Francesco Pensato said: &quot;We have 250,000 [Italian] tourists a season, so it&apos;s normal that [some] lose a passport.&quot; Pensato confirmed that Maraldi had had his passport stolen in Phuket in July last year, and that the number of the passport used to board the flight was the same as that of the stolen passport \u2013 ruling out any possibility that there was another Luigi Maraldi with the same date of birth who may have been on board. Christian Kozel, the 30-year-old Austrian citizen listed on the flight&apos;s manifest, also had his passport stolen two years ago during a flight from Phuket to Bangkok, the Austrian foreign ministry said. Malaysian officials are now using CCTV footage to try to identify the two travellers, while investigators are also looking into reports that another two passengers may have been travelling on false documents. Just why the men posing as the Italian and Austrian would have used the false documents is still unclear. Terrorism is a possibility, but so is asylum: six Syrians hoping to seek refugee status in Sweden have been detained for over a month at Phuket&apos;s international airport after attempting to fly to Stockholm via Beijing on Greek passports. Local media outlet Phuketwan reported that the group said they had chosen to fly through Phuket and Beijing because other refugees had reached Sweden using the same flight path. The two men on board MH370 had booked onward flights via Beijing to Amsterdam, and then Copenhagen for the &quot;Italian&quot;, and Frankfurt for the &quot;Austrian&quot;. The two men seem to have purchased their one-way tickets at the same time from a travel agency in the Thai beach town Pattaya on Thursday. Both Kozel&apos;s and Maraldi&apos;s passports had been reported stolen and were listed in Interpol&apos;s database, yet the airline did not cross-check the 40m-record database to confirm whether any passengers on flight MH370 were flying on dubious documents. Terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna from Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technological University said there were only two categories of travellers using stolen passports: criminals and terrorists. &quot;To blame Malaysian authorities for this is probably unfair \u2013 they have to get it right all the time and potential hijackers just have to get through once,&quot; he added. Malaysia Airlines officials told a press conference on Sunday that terrorism was being investigated as a reason why the plane may have tried to turn back, as reports of potential serious lapses in security at Kuala Lumpur International airport emerged. Just a few months ago, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission and police formed a &quot;flying squad&quot; to address allegations of immigration officers accepting bribes to allow illegal immigrants into the country. At the same time human trafficking gangs were reportedly selling a &quot;Get into Malaysia package&quot; for \u00a3450, in return for which the buyer was smuggled into the country and given a fake &quot;MyKad&quot;, the compulsory identity document for Malaysian citizens. Malaysia&apos;s deputy home minister, Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar, said the government does not deny that &quot;there may be some black sheep among the staff&quot; and added: &quot;Generally, they are good, efficient and honest officers. We will not allow them to be condemned, nor will the department be condemned because of the actions of a few.&quot; The US is expected to investigate the stolen passports once the FBI arrives in Malaysia to assist with the investigation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/flight-mh370-passengers-stolen-passports-not-asian-looking", "sentences": ["Some 40 ships and 30 planes, including teams from Thailand, Australia, the US, Philippines, Vietnam, China, Singapore, Indonesia and New Zealand, are aiding the Malaysians on search and rescue."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-10T18:18:00Z", "title": "Flight MH370: passengers on stolen passports 'not Asian looking'", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Air transport", "Malaysia", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Confusion mounted on Monday over the identities of the two passengers travelling with stolen passports aboard missing flight MH370 after reviews of CCTV footage prompted a Malaysian official to describe them as resembling a black Italian footballer. Civil aviation chief Azharuddin Abdul Rahman told reporters in Kuala Lumpur that the men, who had been travelling on stolen Italian and Austrian passports, were &quot;not Asian looking&quot; and may have been part of a stolen passport syndicate. When prompted by reporters to describe the two men, Azharuddin said: &quot;Do you know a footballer by the name of Balotelli?&quot;, referring to AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, who was born in Italy to Ghanaian parents. It was unclear if Azharuddin was suggesting that the men were of a darker skin tone or if they did bear any resemblance to Balotelli \u2013 who usually sports a mohican and diamond studs. He later explained that investigators were unable to determine the passengers&apos; nationalities based on CCTV footage alone but added: &quot;I think they are not Asian.&quot; The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people lost contact over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam on Saturday. No distress signal was sent. China expressed its frustration over Malaysia&apos;s handling of the investigation with the English-language Global Times \u2013 a government mouthpiece \u2013 saying Malaysia&apos;s response &quot;was not swift enough&quot;. Beijing has sent 10 officials to Kuala Lumpur to provide assistance. &quot;This incident happened more than two days ago, and we hope that the Malaysians can fully understand the urgency of China \u2013 especially of the family members \u2013 and can step up the speed of the investigation and increase efforts on search and rescue,&quot; a foreign ministry spokesman, Qin Gang, told reporters in Beijing. Rahman admitted that Malaysian investigators were puzzled over how the aircraft was able to just suddenly disappear. Earlier potential leads were ruled out after it emerged that the oil slick spotted off the coast of Vietnam was caused by a ship and not an airplane, and the yellow &quot;life raft&quot; suspected to be from the airplane was actually a moss-covered cap of cable reel. However, another debris sighting, some 50 miles off Vietnam&apos;s coast, saw ships dispatched to the area to investigate, as Malaysia said it was doubling its search operations to 100 nautical miles, including parts of peninsular Malaysia, waters north of Sumatra, more of the South China Sea, as well as a section of the Malacca Straits. Some 40 ships and 30 planes, including teams from Thailand, Australia, the US, Philippines, Vietnam, China, Singapore, Indonesia and New Zealand, are aiding the Malaysians on search and rescue. &quot;To confirm what really happened we need hard evidence \u2013 concrete evidence,&quot; Rahman said. &quot;We have not found anything that appears to be objects from the aircraft, let alone the aircraft.&quot; Although Rahman said no protocols had been breached on the Beijing-bound flight, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, announced that all air travel security protocols would be reviewed and stepped up if necessary. The FBI is assisting Malaysian authorities in investigating what may have caused the flight to go missing at 1.30am on 8 March with 239 people on board. In another potentially bizarre twist to the story, the Thai travel agent who booked the tickets for the two men with stolen passports said the purchase had been arranged through an &quot;Iranian contact&quot;. The clients were looking for cheap flights to Europe, Benjaporn Krutnait of the Grand Horizon travel agency in the resort town of Pattaya told the Financial Times, adding that a &quot;long-term business contact&quot; who went by the name of Mr Ali had asked her to reserve the flights, which were later paid for in cash by a friend of Ali&apos;s. While there is as yet no reason to believe that Ali, who Benjaporn described as a middleman, knew that the two men were travelling on stolen passports, the revelations are sure to further fuel speculation of foul play as a senior police official told Reuters that passengers armed with explosives and travelling on stolen passports had previously attempted to fly out of Kuala Lumpur&apos;s international airport. Thailand&apos;s prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, told CNN that Thai police were investigating the identities of the two men as the passports had been stolen from Thailand and were registered with Interpol&apos;s stolen document database. &quot;We don&apos;t know about their nationality yet. But we gave orders for the police to investigate the passport users,&quot; she said. In Beijing, distraught families who have been camping out in the Metropark Lido hotel&apos;s second-storey ballroom finally met Chinese government officials for the first time, during which the frustrated crowd began heckling the officials over the perceived lack of assistance. &quot;Where have you been all this while?&quot; shouted one angry passenger, while another yelled: &quot;Tell us what the chances are of survival for the passengers!&quot; More than 100 people at the hotel signed a petition demanding &quot;truth&quot; from Malaysia Airlines, CNN reported, as the carrier said it would fly out five relatives of each missing passenger to Kuala Lumpur. A US-trained Chinese psychologist, Paul Yin, who has been offering counselling to friends and family of the passengers, told the Guardian that &quot;the uncertainty, really, is the most difficult thing to digest&quot;. &quot;A rationalised explanation doesn&apos;t help them,&quot; he added. &quot;Most of them are holding on to a thin ray of hope. Whether they believe it to be realistic or not,most of them are not letting it go.&quot; Flight MH370 had 227 passengers and 12 crew on board from 14 countries, two-thirds of whom were Chinese. It was scheduled to land in Beijing before disappearing from radars at 1.30am Kuala Lumpur time, roughly an hour after takeoff.

Customers at Eros Kafe can sit outside or head indoors where the blue wallpapered walls are decorated with framed vintage Greek advertisements for cigarettes, coffee and ouzo. Peter Pessios recommends the morning offerings as \u201ctotally different from a regular breakfast\u201d. The cafe offers Australian and Greek flavours, with bacon and eggs ($12.90) sitting alongside yaourti ($12.90), yoghurt with poached figs and crushed walnut, or tiropita ($8.90), filo pastry cheese with fig and tomato relish. The cafe is also known for its meze platters served from mid-afternoon. Try the dolmathes ($12.90), kataifi prawns ($17.50), and octopus tis skaras ($16.90).

Howison discovered the dish after \u201creading about Singapore taxi driver food. It comes in big bowls, and they used to eat it while driving, and exchange dirty bowls for full ones \u2013 a real Singapore taxi driver culture.\u201d NanYang Cafe: Renaissance Arcade - nominated by Lucinna Chua, the Asian Grocer     Lucinna Chua of the Asian Grocer.

The small corner shop has a rustic feel, with plaster giving way to brick, and exposed globes lighting the space. On the back wall, you\u2019ll find the bar\u2019s centrepiece: the wine barrels from which staff will pour you a glass of wine. (From $9 a glass). Pedder is a fan of the \u201ccool and interesting wine varieties\u201d. To go with your Lagrein, Montepulciano or Nero d\u2019avola, there is a concise list of tapas. Try mussels ($12), duck liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 with beetroot jelly ($10), or \u2013 aptly for Pedder \u2013 some cheese (individual servings $5). The selection changes weekly: past offerings have included espresso cheese \u2013 an American-style moist parmesan with freshly ground espresso beans rubbed on the outside \u2013 and, naturally, the Spanish sheep\u2019s milk cheese manchego.

The bar is known for its great coffee (from $3.40), and is particularly popular on Saturday mornings for those in search of the full egg and bacon breakfast ($12). Pasta fan Lee Bugeja is a regular at lunch and Friday nights, when his favourite meal is pasta with bolognese ($12.50). \u201cIt\u2019s great because they use veal and beef mince,\u201d he says, \u201cand with that you get a really good flavour.\u201d Parisis: 138 King William Road, Hyde Park \u2013 nominated by Jo Dunn, Something Wild     Jo Dunn of Something Wild. Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian    The Hyde Park strip of King William road is home to a thriving cafe culture \u2013 and Jo Dunn calls Parisis, which serves modern Italian cuisine, \u201cthe best restaurant in Adelaide\u201d. The room\u2019s main feature is a large wood-fired pizza oven, but most customers choose the outdoor courtyard where you sit in a cast-iron cage, under modern chandeliers. Parisis is not the cheapest place in Adelaide to grab a pizza, but at $17 for a napolitana ranging to $32 for a pollo gambero, it\u2019s good value for the quality. It\u2019s always worth saving a spot for desert: Dunn recommends you finish with the chocolate mousse ($13.50).

Feliciano won\u2019t be to everyone\u2019s taste, but Ross Savvas is a big fan of Pelosi\u2019s \u201cold-school Italian cooking\u201d and the feeling that you\u2019re just being welcomed into someone\u2019s kitchen. The baked pasta is, \u201cabsolutely delicious, in those old aluminum trays, like grandma used to use,\u201d he promises.

It&apos;s the voice, stupid. Where Mervyn King always sounded brittle and defensive, Carney has a delivery that sounds as if it&apos;s been forged out of whisky, quaaludes and late nights listening to Joni Mitchell. Even when he was telling you that you were completely broke all you would hear is this soft Canadian lilt saying, &quot;Chill out, dude. The powder&apos;s great today. Let&apos;s go snowboarding.&quot; Or you would if you could stay awake to the end of one of his sentences. Carney, up before the Treasury select committee, was as intensely relaxed about everything as ever. Was he worried about a housing bubble? Nah, not really. &quot;Though we have to be alert to that possibility,&quot; he replied, with one eye closing. Would it be a problem if businesses went bust if interest rates went up? The eye briefly reopened. &quot;It would be an issue, not a problem.&quot; How did he feel that the economy was in a far better state than he had predicted? &quot;Like, stop hassling me, man. Things are good. Real good. Just enjoy it. This forecasting thing can be really heavy shit sometimes.&quot; (In effect.) Was there any danger he might keep the cash tap turned on and interest rates low for another year just to quantitatively ease the Tories through the election? &quot;Hell no! Do you think I&apos;m on amphetamines?&quot; (More or less.) Carney&apos;s reputation for sound economic judgment as governor has been built on doing not very much and doing that slowly. And he&apos;s not about to change tack anytime soon. Then came Scotland. This was more of a two eye problem. If the Scots gained independence, he said, then the head office of the Royal Bank of Scotland would have to move to London. This came as a bombshell to the committee, but for Carney it didn&apos;t seem that big a deal. It&apos;s not like it would be moving from Montreal to Vancouver, his demeanour suggested. Besides, the snow is just as bad in Edinburgh as it is in London. Danny Alexander has rather less reason to be intensely relaxed. Having spent the last four years being more Tory than the Tories, the chief secretary to the Treasury is now anxious to reposition himself back as a Lib Dem before next May&apos;s election and a possible leadership contest with Nick Clegg. So he could probably have done without being left to take the plaudits for carrying out Conservative policies from the Tory backbenches at Treasury questions in George Osborne&apos;s absence. He also probably regretted saying that &quot;the British people need to know that what every party says is what it means&quot; in answer to a question about having election promises audited. You would have thought that might be a subject the Lib Dems would choose to avoid. At least there was someone having an even worse day. Having been ticked off by the Speaker for giving the wrong answer to an earlier question, Sajid Javid, the economic secretary, blundered straight into an obvious Labour set-up about the failure of the chancellor to appoint any women to the monetary policy committee. &quot;Appointments to the MPC should always be on merit,&quot; said Javid. Whatever the right answer may have been, this was very much the wrong one. On days like these, Javid must wonder whether it was worth taking a 98% pay cut from his job running the Singapore office of Deutsche Bank to become a politician. A weekend on the half-pipe with governor Carney would do him the world of good."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/mar/12/boris-johnson-londoners-first-for-new-homes", "sentences": ["Don&apos;t they get Rightmove in Singapore?"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-12T06:45:00Z", "title": "Boris tells developers to put 'Londoners first' for new homes.

It&apos;s entertaining to see the Tory mayor snuggling so close to Ed Miliband, who&apos;s vowed a ban on homes being exclusively marketed overseas, yet his own press release about the matter quotes Jo Valentine of London First, which represents many of the capital&apos;s property trade giants, confirming that &quot;many of our members already give UK buyers the same chance to buy as anyone else.&quot;  Some of the trade&apos;s biggest cheeses have for some time been party to a &quot;charter&quot; pledging to launch sales drives no later in the UK than in south-east Asia, which is where most of the keenest overseas punters are. The mayor&apos;s &quot;concordat&quot; appears to be the same thing by a posher name.  It&apos;s no skin off developers&apos; noses, you see. A number of them, I&apos;m told, are now even choosing not to look beyond the UK at all if they think their scheme is right for buoyant buyers living here, saving themselves around 75 grand in the process - the sort of outlay required to set up a swish marketing suite in the bubble-blowing regions. In any case, how could a &quot;Londoners first&quot; policy work in practice? Would prospective purchasers be required to show estate agents a gas bill as proof of address? Don&apos;t they get Rightmove in Singapore? This bit of archetypal &quot;Good old Boris&quot; flag-waving PR was advertised as the highlight of his address to the annual MIPIM property trade jamboree in the south of France on the subject of population and housing. The speech makes rather painful viewing, the mayor coming across like a pub comedian fighting a losing battle against the rival attractions of a bar billiards table by the gents.  The content was as thin as the audience appeared indifferent, a blend of solicitous boasts about market-priming transport schemes and plaintive appeals to global property magnates to be generous with their &quot;affordable&quot; percentages when doing their planning gain trade-offs with London boroughs - a bit rich coming from a mayor who&apos;s nodded through Capco&apos;s miserly 11% additional affordable at Earls Court and stepped in to permit a mere 12% at Mount Pleasant. There were, though, a few things to applaud. Johnson asked, rhetorically, if foreign pension fund investors who&apos;ve put money into new, bespoke homes for private rent in London should be shunned. Answer, no. He also repeated his now familiar assertion that the inflationary effect of overseas investors on the London housing market as a whole has been exaggerated, at least in the sense that any ripple effect beyond white hot &quot;prime central&quot; territory seems limited.  He&apos;s not alone in that view. And take note that Outer London house prices are still below what they were before the recession (which helps explain why some of those for which planning permissions were received pre-crunch have become stalled). The whole rich-foreigners-are-driving-Londoners-from-their-own-city narrative has been embraced far too uncritically by certain journalists and politicians. It&apos;s not the foreignness of such investment or the scale of it we should be grumbling about, but the use to which it&apos;s being put. If only Johnson would do more to address that."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/malaysia-airlines-mh370-how-search-unfolded", "sentences": ["Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search and rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began looking for debris or wreckage off Vietnam."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-12T18:44:06Z", "title": "Malaysia Airlines flight MH370: how the search unfolded", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Air transport", "Malaysia", "Plane crashes", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Airline industry", "Business"], "article": "When Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on a clear Saturday night from radar screens, no one could explain how the Boeing 777 had seemingly vanished into thin air. Four days later, there is far more confusion and misinformation circulating than solid evidence, and the aircraft with 239 people on board is still missing. Saturday, 8 March Just hours after the 12.40am flight disappeared, the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said the plane was still in contact with air traffic controllers about two hours into the flight, pinning the last contact at about 2.40am at a point 120 nautical miles off the east coast of Malaysia. But FlightAware, a flight-tracking website, showed the plane climbing to 10,700 metres (35,000ft) before disappearing from records at 1.00am, about 20 minutes after it took off. At 1am, the plane was scheduled to enter Vietnamese air space while flying between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City and did not. No distress signal was issued. Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search and rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began looking for debris or wreckage off Vietnam. China and the Philippines soon sent over their own ships and aircraft to help. A few hours later, a Vietnamese admiral told media the aircraft could have crashed in Vietnamese waters near an island \u2013 with reports of a giant oil slick and column of smoke emerging. Soon, questions over whether terrorism was involved began circulating after an Italian and an Austrian came forward to say they had not flown on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, despite being listed in the flight&apos;s manifest. Sunday Teams from the US began aiding search efforts. Malaysia&apos;s prime minister, Najib Razak, said terrorism was a possibility as authorities began investigating reports that as many as four people on board MH370 may have been using stolen passports. Later that day, a Japan-bound pilot from another Boeing 777 claimed to have made contact with MH370 at 1.30am, minutes before it disappeared, saying he had asked the aircraft if it had entered Vietnamese airspace yet, but received only static and mumbling in return. Vietnam claimed to have found more debris, while the transport minister, Hishamuddin Hussein, told reporters the aircraft may have actually turned back towards Malaysia. Later that day it emerged that the Italian and Austrian men believed to be on board the flight had had their passports stolen in Thailand within the past two years, prompting fears that the men using their passports were terrorists. Monday Malaysia&apos;s aviation chief Aharuddin Abdul Rahman stoked fears of a terrorist plot when he said five passengers had checked in but never boarded the flight. Authorities denied Vietnamese reports that debris had been found, with the oil slick believed to belong to the plane revealed to be from a ship, while the &quot;life raft&quot; spotted off the coast of Vietnam turned out to be a moss-covered cable reel. CCTV footage of the two men travelling on stolen European passports prompted Malaysian officials to describe them as resembling the black Italian striker Mario Balotelli. Razak demanded a review of Kuala Lumpur&apos;s security measures. Tuesday Malaysia Airlines said the pilots may have tried to turn the plane back towards Malaysia as the country widened its search-and-rescue hunt to include a wider trajectory and more teams. In a bizarre twist, Malaysia&apos;s air force chief Tan Sir Rodzali Daud said the plane was detected at 2.40am near Pulau Perak, an island in the Malacca strait \u2013 indicating the plane had indeed flown back and was accounted for a whole hour later after it initially disappeared. He would later deny this claim. Earlier fears of terrorism were slightly assuaged as Interpol said that as more information emerged about the men it sounded less and less like terrorism. Interpol named the two as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, 19, and Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29. Reports suggested they were asylum seekers rather than terrorists. Wednesday Daud said the last radar signal from the missing aircraft was received 200 miles north-west of Penang at 2.15am on Saturday \u2013 a third potential last sighting. This would put the last signal at 45 minutes after authorities had initially said they lost contact. However, Daud said the data had not been received in real time, so it could have belonged to another aircraft. &quot;I&apos;m not saying this is MH370. We are still corroborating this,&quot; he told a press conference. &quot;There is a possibility of the aircraft making a comeback. It remains as a possibility \u2026 It is very difficult to say for sure it is the aircraft.&quot; Unconfirmed reports also emerged of Malaysian fishermen spotting what looked like a life raft with the word &quot;Boarding&quot; on it floating off the east coast of Malaysia, although it is believed to have sunk when authorities attempted to bring it back to shore, while the Beijing News claimed that a dead body was seen in the Malacca strait wearing a life vest. There were still no confirmed reports of any sightings of passengers or debris as night fell."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/12/mh370-malaysia-airlines-search-expands-third-possible-sighting", "sentences": ["Earlier on Wednesday, pressed by relatives of Chinese passengers on what information the military had given civil officials, the Malaysian government&apos;s envoy to China told them now was &quot;not the time&quot; to reveal it, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times reported."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-12T20:07:00Z", "title": "Missing plane search expands as third possible sighting adds to confusion", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "World news", "Air transport", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "Vietnam", "China"], "article": "The international hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 expanded to cover 27,000 square nautical miles on Wednesday as a third potential last sighting added to the confusion over its movements. India became the 12th country to say it would join the search, indicating how far north the operation had been extended. The plane was heading north-east to Beijing when it took off from Malaysia in the early hours of Saturday morning. Officials have said it may have turned around and headed back to Kuala Lumpur when it was lost. On Wednesday, in a new twist to the mystery, officials suggested the plane may have been detected on military radar at 2.15am on Saturday, 200 miles north-west of Penang \u2013 a point which is not only west of the Malay peninsula, but so far north that it would be beyond the coast of Thailand. It was the third possible final time and location officials have given. &quot;We are not saying this is MH370. It&apos;s an unidentified plot,&quot; said air force chief Rodzali Daud at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian authorities are facing growing criticism about muddled and sometimes contradictory briefings. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters: &quot;Right now there is a lot of information, and it&apos;s pretty chaotic, so up to this point we too have had difficulty confirming whether [detection over the strait of Malacca] is accurate or not.&quot; Vietnamese officials had said they were calling off their air search and scaling back their sea search pending further information from Malaysia, but have since announced they will resume a full-scale search. Malaysia&apos;s transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, told reporters: &quot;With each day that passes, I fear search and rescue becomes just search \u2013 but we will never give up hope.&quot; He insisted that authorities had been consistent and transparent, adding: &quot;It is only confusion if you want it to be seen to be confusion.&quot; He told reporters: &quot;We have nothing to hide.&quot; Five days after Beijing-bound MH370 disappeared not long after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am on Saturday, questions regarding its final moments have if anything multiplied. The last certain contact with the plane was at around 1.30am, when it was flying over the South China Sea, between Malaysia and Vietnam. Subsequent readings come from military radars which can detect civilian planes but do not communicate with them, meaning that they cannot identify a particular flight. It is not clear if these radar readings were cross-checked with other information. On Tuesday it was reported that the Malaysian air force chief said the plane had been detected at 2.40am close to Pulau Perak, an island in the strait of Malacca \u2013 meaning it had not only turned back but flown right across the peninsula. Rodzali Daud subsequently denied making that comment, but it is not clear if the authorities are discounting the possible presence of MH370 over the strait or simply cannot confirm it. Experts stress it is far too early to be certain what happened. If both the military radar spots are correct, then they could be consistent with the plane turning back and attempting to navigate back to Kuala Lumpur along the west coast of the peninsula. Earlier on Wednesday, pressed by relatives of Chinese passengers on what information the military had given civil officials, the Malaysian government&apos;s envoy to China told them now was &quot;not the time&quot; to reveal it, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times reported. He did disclose that the last words heard from the flight were: &quot;All right, good night&quot; \u2013 the crew&apos;s response to Malaysian air traffic controllers telling them the flight was entering Vietnamese airspace and that air traffic controllers from Ho Chi Minh City would take over. Two-thirds of those on board the Boeing-777 were Chinese, and China has repeatedly urged Malaysia to speed up search efforts as well as sending more ships and aircraft to assist. It is under pressure as public concern grows about the state of the operation, and relatives have already vented their frustration at Chinese officials. The Washington Post cited one popular post, which has been shared thousands of times by Chinese microbloggers: &quot;Vietnam keeps discovering. Malaysia keeps denying. China keeps sending things on the way. Journalists keep waiting at the Lido hotel [where relatives are waiting]. Family members keep being in pain \u2026 But where is the plane?&quot; Malaysia Airlines has confirmed it received a warning from the Federal Aviation Administration in November, urging airlines to look out for corrosion under the skin of the fuselage of Boeing 777s. Chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya added: &quot;We ensure that all our aircraft are airworthy and comply with all the [circulars] issued by the manufacturers.&quot; Experts have said the aircraft has a strong safety record."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/13/malaysia-airlines-flight-satellite-images", "sentences": ["The envoy said now was &quot;not the time&quot; to reveal the last transmission, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times reported, but went on to disclose it anyway.", "Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search and rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began plying the waters off Vietnam looking for debris."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-13T00:15:00Z", "title": "Malaysia Airlines flight MH370: satellite images give fresh lead", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific", "Plane crashes", "China", "World news"], "article": "Hopes of finding the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have been raised after satellite images showing possible debris from the plane were released on a Chinese government website.

It locates them in the sea off the southern tip of Vietnam and east of Malaysia, near the plane&apos;s original flight path. The revelation could provide searchers with a focus that has eluded them since the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard in the early hours of Saturday. However this is not the first time authorities have announced sightings of objects or oil slicks that they claim might be tied to the missing aircraft. No other governments have confirmed the latest report, and on Wednesday eveningone senior US defence official said that American satellites had not located any sign of a crash.

The crew were responding to information from controllers that the flight was entering Vietnamese airspace and that air traffic controllers from Ho Chi Minh City would take over. The Malaysian government&apos;s envoy to China revealed the last words after being pressed by relatives of Chinese passengers on what information the military had given civil officials. The envoy said now was &quot;not the time&quot; to reveal the last transmission, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times reported, but went on to disclose it anyway. Malaysia has been criticised for giving conflicting and confusing information on the last known location of aircraft. Amid the confusion, Vietnam briefly scaled down search operations in waters off its southern coast, saying it was receiving poor information from Malaysia. Hanoi later said the search was back on in full force and was even extending on to land.     A Vietnamese air force plane involved in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Photograph: Le Quang Nhat/AFP/Getty    On Wednesday night it was reported that the missing flight had been seen going down in flames into the sea south-east of Vietnam. The New Zealand Herald quoted a letter from an oil rig worker who claimed he saw the Malaysian airlines plane descend. The letter has been authenticated, the paper says. Mike McKay told his employers, in an email made public overnight, that he had observed the plane burning at high altitude. &quot;I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right,&quot; he said. &quot;I tried to contact the Malaysian and Vietnam officials several days ago. But I do not know if the message has been received.&quot; McKay said he was on the oil rig Songa Mercur, off south-east Vietnam. When he observed the plane it appeared to be in one piece, he said. &quot;From when I first saw the burning [plane] until the flames went out [still at high altitude] was 10 to 15 seconds,&quot; he wrote. ABC news reported that Vietnam officials confirmed they had received the email but found no wreckage in the area\u00a0specified.

By raising prices of homes, especially in London and the south-east, Help to Buy defeats the purpose of extending access to housing. The six-point plan proposed here would result in a more durable recovery powered by much-needed investment in infrastructure and housing. It begins with two fundamental reforms: switching to a fiscal target that takes account not just of government debt but of assets, and setting up a national land bank, learning from international experience. The ratio of government debt to national income matters: interest has to be paid on debt, and current national income is a rough proxy for the future national income that will generate the tax revenue to service the debt. But the current exclusive concern with debt is a big mistake: the government&apos;s asset position is just as important because assets help to generate the future income to service the debt or can be sold to pay down debt. For example, roads generate revenue directly, even without road pricing or toll roads, from taxes on petrol and licences, and indirectly from the economic activity they lubricate. The real rate of return in Britain on such infrastructure investment \u2013 for example, upgrading the A1 in the north-east \u2013 greatly exceeds the current cost of funding. Further, much of government-owned land is obviously saleable and not hard to value. It makes no sense to include only financial assets in government net debt and exclude potentially saleable land. The first announcement of the budget should therefore state that, in future, the government will target the growth of debt minus assets. Increasing government debt would then not be a concern if it was matched by an increase in assets such as publicly owned productive infrastructure and land. This better target would also discourage the accounting practices of the Brown era, when expensive PFI contracts were used to fund public sector investment without recognising the underlying liabilities. The second fundamental announcement in the budget, made possible by the first, should be the setting up of a national land bank. This acquires land cheaply and holds it for future release for housing and commercial development. In countries such as South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, national land banks have played major roles in urban development, supplying land for housing, generating planning gain to pay for infrastructure and in controlling real estate prices. In Britain, with sometimes hundred-fold price differences between land with and without planning permission, a government land bank could buy land without residential or commercial planning permission but with potential for future development. In future, this would be a source of land release for housing and other development, capturing planning gain for the taxpayer. Such land purchases would initially have zero impact on correctly measured net debt, but future revaluation gains would bring down net debt, while the cashflow from sales would lower future government deficits. This radical step, together with better incentives for local authorities to grant planning permissions, would transform the supply of housing in under-housed Britain. Currently, young people without wealthy and generous relatives have great difficulty getting onto the housing ladder. According to the census the fraction of owner occupiers among those aged 25 to 34 has declined from 58% in 2001 to 40% in 2011. The land bank proposal would allow house prices relative to income gradually to decline in coming decades, helping the &quot;lost generation&quot; of those born after 1979. The next four decisions would complement these two fundamentals: 1. Substantially increase infrastructure spending. 2. Restrict Help to Buy to regions outside London and the south-east but retain Help to Build everywhere to encourage house building. 3. Announce a mansion tax in which the excess of current values above \u00a33m is taxed at 1%. Britain has the lowest property tax rates for the super-rich among advanced countries. The proposed tax rate would still be lower than in many other countries such as the US. Measures 2 and 3 would take some of the heat out of housing markets in London and the south-east. 4. Take advantage of low borrowing costs in index-linked gilts to fund more than the current government deficit by issuing large amounts of index linked gilts. &quot;Overfunding&quot; of this kind was used in the 1980s. It would save the taxpayer money in the long run. It would also have the advantage of lifting current yields and so reducing the apparent deficits in defined-benefit pension schemes. This should boost company investment in the real economy. These measures for balanced and sustained growth and a more equal society need a government capable of taking the long view currently lacking in Westminster. \u2022 John Muellbauer is a professor of economics at Nuffield College and INET Oxford"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/14/flight-mh370-false-leads-confusion-hunt-missing-plane", "sentences": ["Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search-and-rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began looking for debris or wreckage off Vietnam."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-14T15:14:33Z", "title": "Flight MH370: a week of false leads and confusion in hunt for missing plane", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Air transport", "Plane crashes", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "When Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared on a clear Saturday night from radar screens, no one could explain how the Boeing 777 had seemingly vanished into thin air. Seven days later, there is far more confusion and misinformation circulating than solid evidence, and the aircraft with 239 people on board is still missing. Saturday, 8 March  Just hours after the 12.40am flight disappeared, the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said the plane was still in contact with air traffic controllers about two hours into the flight, pinning the last contact at about 2.40am at a point 120 nautical miles off the east coast of Malaysia. But FlightAware, a flight-tracking website, showed the plane climbing to 10,700 metres (35,000ft) before disappearing from records at 1am, about 20 minutes after it took off. At 1am, the plane was scheduled to enter Vietnamese air space while flying between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City and did not. No distress signal was issued. Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search-and-rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began looking for debris or wreckage off Vietnam. China and the Philippines soon sent over their own ships and aircraft to help. A few hours later, a Vietnamese admiral told media the aircraft could have crashed in Vietnamese waters near an island \u2013 with reports of a giant oil slick and column of smoke emerging. Soon, questions over whether terrorism was involved began circulating after an Italian and an Austrian came forward to say they had not flown on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, despite being listed in the flight&apos;s manifest. Sunday      A family member of a passenger on flight MH370. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex    Teams from the US began aiding search efforts. Malaysia&apos;s prime minister, Najib Razak, said terrorism was a possibility as authorities began investigating reports that as many as four people on board MH370 may have been using stolen passports. Later that day, a Japan-bound pilot from another Boeing 777 claimed to have made contact with MH370 at 1.30am, minutes before it disappeared, saying he had asked the aircraft if it had entered Vietnamese airspace yet, but received only static and mumbling in return. Vietnam claimed to have found more debris, while the Malaysian transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, told reporters the aircraft may have turned back towards Malaysia. Later that day it emerged that the Italian and Austrian men believed to be on board the flight had had their passports stolen in Thailand within the past two years, prompting fears that the men using their passports were terrorists. Monday      Two men who boarded the flight using stolen European passports. Photograph: Joshua Paul Gilbert/Rex    Malaysia&apos;s aviation chief Aharuddin Abdul Rahman stoked fears of a terrorist plot when he said five passengers had checked in but never boarded the flight. Authorities denied Vietnamese reports that debris had been found, with the oil slick believed to belong to the plane revealed to be from a ship, while the &quot;life raft&quot; spotted off the coast of Vietnam turned out to be a moss-covered cable reel. CCTV footage of the two men travelling on stolen European passports prompted Malaysian officials to describe them as resembling the black Italian striker Mario Balotelli. Razak demanded a review of Kuala Lumpur&apos;s security measures. Tuesday      Chinese air force crew members search for the plane. Photograph: Xinhua/Landov/Barcroft Media    Malaysia Airlines said the pilots may have tried to turn the plane back towards Malaysia as the country widened its search-and-rescue hunt to include a wider trajectory and more teams. In a bizarre twist, Malaysia&apos;s air force chief Tan Sir Rodzali Daud said the plane had been detected at 2.40am near Pulau Perak, an island in the Malacca strait \u2013 indicating the plane had indeed flown back and was accounted for a whole hour later after it initially disappeared. He would later deny this claim. Earlier fears of terrorism were slightly assuaged as Interpol said that as more information emerged about the men it sounded less and less like terrorism. Interpol named the two as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, 19, and Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29, both from Iran. Reports suggested they were asylum seekers rather than terrorists.

Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP    Daud said the last radar signal from the missing aircraft was received 200 miles north-west of Penang at 2.15am on Saturday \u2013 a third potential last sighting. This would put the last signal at 45 minutes after authorities had initially said they lost contact. However, Daud said the data had not been received in real time, so it could have belonged to another aircraft. &quot;I&apos;m not saying this is MH370. We are still corroborating this,&quot; he told a press conference. &quot;There is a possibility of the aircraft making a comeback. It remains as a possibility \u2026 It is very difficult to say for sure it is the aircraft.&quot; Unconfirmed reports also emerged of Malaysian fishermen spotting what looked like a life raft with the word &quot;Boarding&quot; on it floating off the east coast of Malaysia, although it is believed to have sunk when authorities attempted to bring it back to shore, while the Beijing News claimed that a dead body was seen in the Malacca strait wearing a life vest. There were still no confirmed reports of any sightings of passengers or debris as night fell. Thursday      A Vietnamese military official looks out of a plane window during the hunt. Photograph: Luong Thai Linh/EPA    Sources &quot;familiar with the details&quot; of the missing Boeing 777 told the Wall Street Journal Sources that US investigators believed the plane had flown for a total of five hours, indicating that the plane may have been diverted &quot;with the intention of using it later for another purpose&quot;. The theory was apparently based on data downloaded in real time and &quot;sent to the ground&quot; straight from the Boeing&apos;s engines, which are manufactured by the British company Rolls-Royce. The data-retrieval system is said to be standard procedure for maintaining and monitoring the engines and is loaded with information regarding the jet&apos;s performance, altitude and speed, which is then &quot;compiled and transmitted in 30-minute increments&quot;, according to the Journal. A New Scientist report on the Boeing engine data-retrieval system also indicated that Rolls-Royce had received two data summaries from MH370 \u2013 one while it was taking off from Kuala Lumpur, and the second as it was climbing towards Beijing. However, Malaysian officials denied that the engines transmitted any data past 1.07am. &quot;We have contacted both the possible sources of data \u2013 Rolls-Royce and Boeing \u2013 and both have said they did not receive data beyond 1.07am,&quot; Ahmad, the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, told reporters on Thursday afternoon. &quot;The last transmission at 1.07am stated that everything was operating normally.&quot; Malaysian authorities have also stated that the plane was again caught on radar at 2.30am (this was later denied), and on military radar at 2.15am near the Malacca strait, indicating the plane had turned away from its flight path towards Beijing. Officials are still verifying whether the &quot;blip&quot; on the military radar at 2.30am was actually the MH370, Hishammuddin reiterated on Thursday, and he refused to answer whether that blip had also dropped off the military radar. Friday  After a week of no plane and no real leads, a dramatic storyline emerged after radar-trafficking data suggested MH370 may have flown deliberately off course towards the Andaman Islands after it last made contact with air traffic control, indicating that foul play was behind the jet&apos;s disappearance. Sources told Reuters the flight path of an unidentified aircraft investigators believed to be MH370 was following a route with specific navigational waypoints, suggesting someone with aviation training was at the helm, zigzagging the plane from its flightpath towards Beijing out west towards the Bay of Bengal. &quot;What we can say is we are looking at sabotage, with hijack still on the cards,&quot; a senior Malaysian police official told Reuters.     Men offer prayers for the missing plane at the Kuala Lumpur international airport. Photograph: Wong Maye-E/AP    The revelations emerged the same day as reports that the aircraft&apos;s two communications systems were &quot;systematically shut down&quot; and that &quot;manual intervention&quot; was the probable cause. According to two US officials who spoke to ABC News, the 777&apos;s data reporting system was shut down at 1.07am, while the transponder \u2013 which sends back information to civilian radar regarding performance, location and altitude \u2013 was turned off at 1.21am. American authorities have since decided to move their search operation towards the Indian Ocean after an undisclosed suggestion the plane may have crashed there. &quot;We have an indication the plane went down in the Indian Ocean,&quot; a senior Pentagon official said. At a press conference late on Friday afternoon, Hishammuddin, Malaysia&apos;s acting transport minister, said authorities were investigating the possibility that the plane&apos;s communications systems had been deliberately shut down and said there were &quot;four or five possibilities&quot; why. &quot;It could have been done intentionally. It could be done under duress. It could have been done because of an explosion,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s why I don&apos;t want to go into the realm of speculation. We are looking at all the possibilities.&quot; Hishammuddin confirmed that MH370&apos;s &quot;whole passenger manifest&quot;, including crew, was being looked into and added: &quot;If investigation requires searching the pilots&apos; homes, it will be done.&quot; The Wall Street Journal also changed its earlier report about &quot;engine data&quot; to &quot;satellite pings&quot;, which are believed to also send back data regarding a plane&apos;s location.

Uncovering abandoned sex museums and decrepit amusement parks Urban exploration has been gaining adepts for a while now, and it seems to be the go-to-hobby for the adventurous souls who need tangible and risky thrills in city environments. Now, the Japanese have given it a name, haikyo, and are taking it to structures such as abandoned amusement parks and old sex museums. This CNN reportage follows the steps of German Florian Seidel, who has been seeking out and visiting crumbling Japanese infrastructures for five years. He visited two abandoned sex museums which have been deserted for a decade \u2013 after the advent of the Internet, he says \u2013 but still maintain quite a lot of their charm, so to speak. \u201cThe one in Hokkaido he remembers best for the bizarre shooting games and taxidermy animals in sexual positions -- horses and monkeys\u201d, writes Kate Whitehead.

Cities we lost This Al-Jazeera article follows the history of cities that were once pan-Mediterranean hubs such as Alexandria and which, in the last century, have been losing a lot of their character though demolition. In the context of political and economic crises in Turkey and Greece or the strife in Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere, \u201cwhy cry over the eradication of an era that is anyway irretrievably extinct?\u201d asks Iason Athanasiadis. \u201cI believe we should care because the story of how the cosmopolitan era ended allows us to uncover the threads of the narrative that brought us to the current precipice: a largely homogenised region facilitated by the expulsion of minorities and fostering of so-called \u2018pure\u2019 Turkish, Greek or Arab nations\u201d, he writes. A fascinating read.  3. Shipping containers reinvented as new homes for Shanghai\u2019s migrant workers  Many migrant workers in Shanghai have long been living in deplorable conditions \u2013 some of them even in homes built out of containers, and for years. While some of these communities have faced relocation, a new container village endorsed by the government and created by a non-profit company is ready to open. Dubbed Community Cube, this two-storey 150 square-metred structure was completed last year and is formed by a number of used shipping containers joined together by metal plates, as reported in Gizmag. These plates can actually be detached, explains Adam Williams, \u201callowing the separate containers to be transported more easily if the migrants need to move on\u201d. 4. Seven Cairo documentaries While The Square, the Oscar-nominated documentary about Tahrir and the Egyptian revolution, might undoubtedly be an interesting watch, it can be difficult to find recent films about Cairo that are about the city itself putting the Arab Spring aside.

American authorities have confirmed that they went through the passengers and crew members on the manifest and none had any known links to extremist groups. Now attention is shifting to the two pilots after Malaysian police began a search of their homes. The last message from the flight deck to Malaysian air traffic control was &quot;all right, good night&quot;. This appears to have been made after the aircraft communications and reporting system (Acars), which sends information about the plane&apos;s location to air traffic control, was deliberately switched off. If so it may suggest that one or both of the pilots were key players in the drama, possibly under duress. Mike Glynn, a committee member of the Australian and International Pilots Association, thought pilot suicide was the most likely explanation for the disappearance. It was the suspected cause of a SilkAir crash flying from Singapore to Jakarta in 1997 and an EgyptAir flight in 1999. &quot;A pilot rather than a hijacker is more likely to be able to switch off the communications equipment,&quot; Glynn said. &quot;The last thing that I, as a pilot, want is suspicion to fall on the crew, but it&apos;s happened twice before.&quot; The two pilots, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, have both been described as respectable, community-minded men. Shah who joined the national carrier in 1981, spent his off days playing with a flight simulator. &quot;He was an aviation tech geek,&quot; one pilot said. &quot;You could ask him anything and he would help you. That is the kind of guy he was.&quot; An avid collector of remote-controlled, miniature aircraft, he is certified Malaysia&apos;s Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) as an examiner to conduct simulator tests for pilots. Shah, born in Penang state in Malaysia, studied at Penang Free School before becoming a pilot. A keen amateur chef, his signature dishes included bihun noodles and butter prawns. Friends and colleagues said it was impossible that he could be to blame for the disappearance. &quot;He knew everything about the Boeing 777,&quot; said one pilot. &quot;Something significant would have had to happen for Zaharie and the plane to go missing. It would have to be total electrical failure.&quot; Shah had more than 18,000 hours of flying experience. His co-pilot, Hamid, had clocked 2,763 hours \u2013 having joined Malaysia Airlines in 2007. Hamid was revealed to have invited two female passengers into the cockpit during a flight from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur, breaking Malaysia Airlines rules. Investigators are also re-examining the backgrounds of others on board. Flight 370 had 153 Chinese, 38 Malaysians, seven Indonesians, six Australians, five Indians, four French people, three Americans and two people each from Canada, New Zealand and Ukraine. Two Iranians were travelling on stolen Austrian and Italian passports. Eighteen-year-old Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad was hoping to join his mother in Germany. The other was named by Interpol as Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29. Also among the passengers was a group of Chinese artists returning home after an exhibition.

But Babymetal, a trio of Japanese teenage girls, have paired rah-rah skirts and hair ribbons with infernal metallic riffs to produce what could be the most unlikely music phenomenon of the year. The band&apos;s eponymous debut album is No 3 on iTunes&apos; US rock chart and has made the online top 10 in six other countries, including the UK. The video for their new single, Gimme Chocolate, has received more than 3.7m views on YouTube, and their dramatic arrival on the international metal scene won them a place on the cover of the latest edition of Kerrang! magazine. Babymetal&apos;s music owes more to the uncomfortable marriage between the J-pop perennials of Lolita fantasy than to the bare-bones metal sound of, say, Slipknot. In the Gimme Chocolate video, the guitarists and drummer are practically invisible, while the catchy chorus will sound more familiar to fans of J-pop girlband AKB48. Babymetal \u2013 Suzuka Nakamoto, 16, Moa Kikuchi and Yui Mizuno, both 14 \u2013 grew out of the all-girl band Sakura Gakuin. Their mission \u2013 to fuse the saccharine sound of J-pop with thrash metal \u2013 was daunting, given none of the girls had even heard of metal before being thrown together by executives at the Amuse talent agency. But they have handled their tricky musical brief with ease. The band&apos;s first major single, Ijime, Dame, Zettai, sold 19,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number six in the Japanese Orion weekly singles chart. Steve McClure, the executive director of the online music site McClure Music, described &quot;karaoke-friendly&quot; Gimme Chocolate as &quot;well done for what it is&quot;. &quot;Babymetal have some clever marketing and slick production values behind them. They&apos;re a good example of a spin on the &apos;kawaii&apos; [cute] template. The song is a bit formulaic in the sense that it&apos;s a knock-off of the AKB48 kawaii genre, but it&apos;s a catchy tune.&quot; Despite the phenomenal domestic success of AKB48 and other girl bands, J-pop has struggled to make an impact outside north-east Asia. Korea&apos;s Girls&apos; Generation and Co, however, is riding a global K-pop wave. And yet McClure does not forsee Babymetal as the new face of Japan&apos;s pop industry. The critic has drawn an unfavourable comparison between the band and rival outfit Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, whose viral success led to a sellout concert at the Japan Expo in Paris in 2012 and a world tour the following year. &quot;I see them more as a novelty act, and by definition that means they&apos;re probably going to be a one-off,&quot; he said. &quot;And Babymetal aren&apos;t really being marketed as a Japanese act. They&apos;re coming out of leftfield, so I&apos;m sceptical about this being the start of something bigger for J-pop.&quot; Just as South Koreans had been listening to Psy for years before he became a household name with Gangnam Style in the summer of 2012, Babymetal are hardly new \u2013 they formed three years ago \u2013 and have since appeared on Japan&apos;s festival circuit, performing twice at Summer Sonic in Tokyo and Osaka. At the end of last year, they performed overseas for the first time, in Singapore, on the back of their Death Match tour of Japan.

Investigators are working to narrow down the last possible observation of flight MH370 after analysis of satellite information revealed it was in one of two vast corridors: a northern area stretching from the border of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to northern Thailand; and a southern range stretching from Indonesia to the southern Indian Ocean. Twenty-five countries are now involved in the search for the plane, which officials believe was deliberately diverted from its route to Beijing not long after it took off from Kuala Lumpur just after midnight on 8 March. Malaysia&apos;s New Straits Times reported that investigators were considering the possibility that the Boeing 777 dropped to 5,000ft or potentially even lower to avoid detection. It suggested that the aircraft might not have roused the suspicions of those watching military radars if it followed commercial routes. It also cited unnamed sources as saying the plane had flown low over the Malay peninsula. It is unclear where the altitude estimate originated and experts said that if it came from radar data it could well prove incorrect. Aviation safety expert Sidney Dekker, of the Safety Science Innovation Lab at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, noted: &quot;Particularly over oceanic areas, radar coverage is extremely unreliable and partial.&quot; He dismissed the idea that flying at 5,000ft would put extensive strain on the airframe, as some have suggested: &quot;The only really relevant effect is a dramatic increase in fuel use \u2013 its range would be very much shortened by that,&quot; he said. Jason Middleton, head of the aviation department at New South Wales University, said avoiding the radar was a well-known technique used by drug runners and others. He added: &quot;Radar goes in a straight line. If you are in the shadow of a mountain or even the curve of the Earth \u2013 if you are under the radar beam \u2013 you can&apos;t be seen. &quot;The further [radar beams] go out the weaker they are and the further they need to come back. Radars have dead zones which are low and also which are far away.&quot; However, pilots might also fly low on their way to a landing, if the cabin was depressurised \u2013 to prevent crew and passengers suffering oxygen deprivation \u2013 or if they were suffering mechanical problems. Kazakhstan&apos;s civil aviation authority told the BBC it was not possible for the plane to have reached its airspace undetected, noting that it would have had to fly over China, India and other countries, while Pakistan&apos;s civil aviation authority said checks of its radar recordings found nothing connected to the flight. Military radar systems can also be limited in their coverage and may not always be in use. Malaysia&apos;s briefings have made it clear that its own military did not initially take heed of MH370 when it appeared on radar screens heading westwards after diverting. A senior Indian official also told Reuters this weekend that the Boeing 777 might not have been detected by installations on the Andaman and Nicobar islands because the radars might have been switched off, adding: &quot;We operate on an &apos;as required&apos; basis.&quot; The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, told parliament that the country had taken on responsibility for searching a major section of the southern Indian Ocean at the request of his Malaysian counterpart. He added that Najib Razak had also accepted an offer of additional Australian maritime surveillance resources. The foreign ministry of China, which has more than 150 citizens on board the flight, said in a statement on Monday that Malaysia must &quot;immediately&quot; expand and clarify the search. The English edition of the Global Times \u2013 a state-run populist tabloid \u2013 ran a scathing commentary on the search effort, accusing Malaysia of incompetence and suggesting it might need to hand over responsibility for the search operation. Three French investigators have joined the multinational team in Kuala Lumpur to share their expertise from the 2009 search for Air France flight 447. Investigators from the US, UK and China are already involved, but the New York Times reported that Malaysia had refused to accept large-scale American assistance, citing unnamed senior officials. Families of the 239 on board have said that investigators&apos; belief that the plane was diverted deliberately has given them fresh hope that the passengers and crew might have survived. David Lawton, an Australian man whose brother and sister-in-law are on the missing plane, told Fairfax Media: &quot;While you&apos;ve got hope, you&apos;ve got worries too. Because if they&apos;re alive, are they being treated well, or what&apos;s happening?&quot; Authorities were also exploring whether anyone on board besides the pilots had aviation experience. Reuters reported that Malaysian police were investigating a Malaysian flight engineer who was among the passengers, 29-year-old Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat. According to Singapore&apos;s Straits Times, his father said his son would have done no wrong and that no officers had been to search their home, adding: &quot;Even if they do, we have nothing to hide.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/17/housing-alternatives-to-buying-house-young-people", "sentences": ["Friends have accepted job offers in Hong Kong; a few more moved to Singapore, or Berlin."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-17T16:30:22Z", "title": "Home and dry: young people on alternatives to buying a place", "tags": ["Property", "Real estate", "First-time buyers", "Housing", "Society", "Housing market", "Renting property", "Business", "Communities"], "article": "     In the UK, buying a house is often presented as the only credible option for someone wanting a happy, settled, successful life. We are a culture hopelessly devoted to home ownership. But as the property market has spiralled out of control \u2013 in the late 1990s, the average house was five times the average salary, whereas now it is 10 times that, and rising \u2013 more and more people, especially young people, are questioning this. One twentysomething I spoke to said that what was now being asked for a house felt like finding a \u00a390 pricetag on a doughnut. And rather than being despondent, many are seeking out more affordable, alternative options, and finding unexpected silver linings \u2026 Sharing a flat Jaber Mohamed, 24, is a reporter for the Haringey Independent, and rents a flat in Tottenham with his sister, Bushra, for which he pays \u00a3550 a month In the three years since he moved to London, Jaber Mohamed has lived in a range of houses and flatshares \u2013 and found the one in the most expensive area was by far the most boring. He came to the city as an intern in 2011, and found a room in a shared house in Peckham through the classified ads website Gumtree. At \u00a3500 a month, including bills, it is the most affordable place he has lived in London so far, and he says other friends have had similarly good experiences with sites such as spareroom.co.uk.     Jaber Mohamed and his sister Bushra. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    For Mohamed, the answer to finding somewhere affordable to live has been to look in areas people often dismiss. Tottenham has a certain reputation, he says, &quot;and for the most part it&apos;s nonsense. I&apos;ve lived in Peckham, Tottenham and Elephant and Castle, some of the, quote-unquote, roughest areas of London, and I&apos;ve loved them all. I&apos;ve also lived in East Finchley, and to be honest, I absolutely hated it. It was very boring. Obviously, it&apos;s very family-friendly, but if you want a bit more variety and culture in an area, there are much more interesting places.&quot; He and his friends live in an old, converted house in Tottenham, which was refurbished just before they moved in. He recognises rental prices will probably rise in Tottenham soon too, that people are being pushed out of cities such as London, and he would like to see more rent controls. Being able to rent has given him a freedom he appreciates. &quot;Buying a house feels like a massive commitment, like having children,&quot; he says. &quot;All of a sudden you have responsibilities, and you&apos;re tied down. I&apos;m constantly on the verge of going away, travelling, deciding I want to move country \u2013 recently I was contemplating moving to Germany, and before that, Australia.

She could live on the water. Since moving to London in her early 20s she had moved from one flatshare to another, with no prospect of buying a place. She had been left some money by a relative \u2013 too little for a house deposit but just enough, she realised, to explore a different option. Haydock spoke to a colleague who was living on a boat, stayed there to see whether she liked it, then started looking on a website called Apollo Duck. She found a 56ft houseboat for \u00a324,000, and decided to go for it. There&apos;s a tiny bathroom with a shower and toilet, a living space with a kitchen, and a separate bedroom compartment, which swung it for her, she says.     Paula Haydock outside her houseboat with Rupert. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Permanent moorings can be difficult to find in London &quot;because those who have them keep them&quot; and so instead Haydock has a continuous cruiser licence, which means she has to move every two weeks. This is included in her annual boat licence, she says, which costs around \u00a3800 a year. Moving suits her because, as a freelance, she works in offices all over the city, and it allows her to &quot;pull up near work. I don&apos;t have a big commute, which is nice.&quot; In fact, &quot;being on the canal is an amazing opportunity to be in the centre of London \u2026 You&apos;re so lucky, you can be in Regent&apos;s Park, and not that many people could afford to live there normally, could they?&quot; Being able to buy the boat outright also freed her from some of the pressures of her work, &quot;because when you&apos;re freelance you&apos;re always thinking, &apos;when&apos;s my next job, when is the next contract coming in?&apos; And that&apos;s not quite as stressful now.&quot; The downsides are the cold in winter and having to empty the toilet every few weeks, but these haven&apos;t fazed her. She lives on the boat with her rescue dog, Rupert, a staffie cross, and remembers evenings last summer, with her hatch open, as being magical. &quot;A swan will go past, and it&apos;s very calm and quiet. You think of London as being so noisy, but it&apos;s much more relaxing on the canal.&quot; Moving back home Rachael Jones, 27, works for a PR agency in Shrewsbury, and lives with her parents and younger sister in Kerry, mid-Wales When she tells people she has moved back in with her parents, Rachael Jones often sees a look cross their face \u2013 they clearly think she&apos;s taken a step back. But she feels differently. Before moving to her parents&apos; farmhouse almost a year ago, she was living with friends in a small house in Birmingham, spending nearly half her monthly salary on rent. &quot;You can&apos;t really enjoy yourself if you&apos;re always thinking about money,&quot; she says. &quot;There was a strong sense that I was working my arse off every day, and I didn&apos;t have much to show for it.&quot; When her company decided to move her job from Birmingham to Shrewsbury \u2013 a 40-minute commute from her childhood home \u2013 she asked her parents if she could move back in. She&apos;s not alone in making this decision. In the UK, 3.3 million people aged 20 to 34 now live with their parents, 26% of the young adult population.     Rachael Jones with her parents Gwen and Phillip. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    There have been some obvious advantages for Jones. She doesn&apos;t pay rent but contributes to food and bills. She can now afford a car, and see her friends more often, and the move has given her much more financial freedom to travel too \u2013 she&apos;s going to Australia in a few months&apos; time, and has been thinking about a trip to South America. It&apos;s also given her the chance to spend time with her family again, and she says the experience is quite different to living at home as an adolescent. &quot;I definitely feel there&apos;s more equality in my relationship with my parents, and they respect my decisions and independence.&quot; Her family keep about 50 sheep on their smallholding, and she&apos;s been helping out recently with her favourite time of year \u2013 lambing season. Being a property guardian Jonny Douglas, 33, runs his own design consultancy, and is a property guardian in Sheffield, paying \u00a3250 a month When Jonny Douglas&apos;s friend Jamie first heard about the house they now live in, he assumed the advertised price was an error. The building is a three-storey mansion in Sheffield, built as a private home in 1777, and used over the years as an asylum, a school and, most recently, a community centre. When it fell into disuse, the council decided to fill it with property guardians \u2013 a cheaper option than security guards \u2013 and the rooms were advertised through Ad Hoc. The \u00a3250 a month Douglas pays includes all his bills. Property guardians live in empty properties \u2013 sometimes fairly quirky ones \u2013 to help keep them secure, and report any problems that might arise, such as leaks. There are eight people where Douglas lives, and they share a communal kitchen and shower rooms. He has three rooms to himself: a large living room, bedroom, and kitchen. &quot;Including my little balcony, I&apos;ve got about 1,100 sqft,&quot; he says, &quot;which is the size of the average two-bedroom house in the UK.&quot; Concerns have been raised about the limited rights afforded to property guardians \u2013 Douglas&apos;s contract stipulates he can be given two weeks&apos; notice to leave, for instance, but the freedom to leave also suits him, he says. He has felt settled and confident enough to redecorate his rooms, mostly via Freecycle, where people give unwanted items away. &quot;I&apos;ve ended up with everything I could want \u2013 a pool table, a table football table, dining table and chairs, sofas, carpets. I even got five and a half metres of kitchen worktop and a fridge freezer. The only thing I&apos;ve spent money on in this place is paint.&quot; There is more than an acre of grounds for him to practise his hobby, slacklining, (a form of tightrope walking), and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. &quot;Every single morning when I get up and walk into the main room,&quot; he says, &quot;the sun is coming through the windows \u2013 because my room is south-facing \u2013 everything&apos;s light and airy, and I sit in here, with birds tweeting, and kids running around enjoying themselves in the school nearby, and there&apos;s nowhere I would rather be \u2026 It&apos;s perfect. I don&apos;t play the lottery, but the one reason I would is so I could buy this place.&quot; &apos;I regret entering the housing market so young&apos; by Eleanor Ross After university I moved to London to start a graduate role in the Civil Service on an average wage. I quickly got sick of renting grubby, dirty rooms. I had worked thankless waitressing jobs since I was 16, and, coupled with a small inheritance from my late grandmother, I&apos;d been able to put aside a small sum of money. My boyfriend suggested that we should look into buying. I thought he was joking. Rich kids buy houses, I did not. Before long he&apos;d booked us into a whirlwind of appointments with banks and we were told that we could look at getting a small mortgage. A &quot;small mortgage&quot; stretched to a one bedroom in the least salubrious area of London&apos;s zone two, which we were assured by the estate agent was &quot;up and coming&quot;. We jumped and our offer was accepted. I felt overwhelmingly fortunate, and surprised. Perhaps it was a rushed decision or perhaps it was just a &quot;two fingers up&quot; to everyone who said that this generation were lost. Although buying a flat gave me enough financial security to leave a job I hated and start a journalism masters&apos;, I still regret entering the housing market so young. Newspapers in London have stopped hiring and I&apos;m terrified that I&apos;m going to end up unemployed and saddled with a mortgage when I graduate. Friends have accepted job offers in Hong Kong; a few more moved to Singapore, or Berlin. In London, the job market is saturated with graduates. On job sites, adverts for jobs based abroad dominate in my field. At university we&apos;re encouraged to look further and further from the UK, to the Middle East and to China. But I&apos;m tied to London now, I can&apos;t leave. I can&apos;t bear to even think what will happen if I can&apos;t get a job on graduation \u2013 will my home be repossessed? What may have been right for my parents&apos; generation, who bought when the job market was buoyant, is possibly not right for mine. Because of the conditions of my mortgage, I can&apos;t even rent the flat out. Something that should be a pleasure, feels like a noose around my neck."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/17/clarissa-dickson-wright", "sentences": ["Both parents were of Scottish descent, although her mother&apos;s immediate forebears had connections with Singapore and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-17T19:08:44Z", "title": "Clarissa Dickson Wright obituary", "tags": ["Clarissa Dickson Wright", "Food & drink", "Food and drink", "Life and style", "Books", "Television & radio", "Law", "Alcoholism", "Scotland", "Edinburgh", "Rural affairs", "Hunting"], "article": "Clarissa Dickson Wright, who has died aged 66 in Edinburgh&apos;s Royal Infirmary, took the world of television food and drink by storm when she was paired up with Jennifer Paterson in the BBC series Two Fat Ladies (1996-99). The presenters&apos; eccentricity, their love of cream and meat and very rich food, the unscripted whimsy of their on-screen exchanges and, of course, their physical presence and demeanour made them unforgettable \u2013 as if two women of a certain age perambulating Britain in an uncertainly piloted motorcycle combination was not already enough to fix them in our memory. Born in London, Clarissa was the youngest daughter of Arthur Dickson Wright, a prominent surgeon, and Molly (nee Bath). Both parents were of Scottish descent, although her mother&apos;s immediate forebears had connections with Singapore and Australia. Clarissa was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and remained one, albeit sometimes truculently. Educated at the Sacred Heart Convent in Hove, East Sussex, she studied law at University College London, being at the time the youngest woman \u2013 at the age of 21 \u2013 ever to be called to the bar. Had she done as she was told, she would have studied medicine at Oxford. By her own account, her childhood was not happy. Within the family her father was autocratic and violent, and often drunk. Her siblings were much older, so she bore the brunt of his displeasure alone, save for her mother, whom she adored, and whose early death in 1975 precipitated Clarissa&apos;s own descent into alcoholism. She hauled herself out of that pit by the end of the 1980s (thanks to the Promis recovery centre near Canterbury, Kent). Her drinking had put paid to a legal career, but she refashioned her identity as a good and knowledgeable cook at Books for Cooks in Notting Hill, central London. There she alternately terrified and charmed keen cooks and bibliophiles from behind her desk. Terrified: because she knew more than most of them and looked quite fierce (and had little sufferance for fools); charmed: because she had lashings of wit and told a good story. That venture came to an untidy end and she popped up next with her own shop in Edinburgh, the Cook&apos;s Bookshop: it lasted until she declared herself bankrupt in 2004. Although I had seen Clarissa on television in the laste 1980s extolling the culinary virtues of that proto-artichoke the cardoon (whose torch she continued to bear until the very end), it was only in 1994 that the television producer Pat Llewellyn had the idea of creating the dreamteam of Clarissa and the characterful cook at the Spectator magazine \u2013 and motorcyclist \u2013 Jennifer Paterson. They were acquaintances, but not particularly close friends. The Two Fat Ladies series on BBC2 was inspired. They took to the medium with little coaching and needed little scriptwriting. They simply reacted to whatever situation \u2013 boy scouts&apos; camp, aristocratic shooting lodge, Brazilian embassy \u2013 the producers put them into. Paterson&apos;s death (she was two decades older than Clarissa) in 1999 put a sudden end to their joint trajectory. Clarissa&apos;s television career continued, now embracing more of country life and its blessings. Her new role was set in aspic in the series she made with Sir John Scott, a hill farmer, called Clarissa and the Countryman (2000-03): roughing it with the plus-four set with some discussion of the plight of rural Britain, the farming industry, the local food producer and the happy huntsman in the mix. She became a pin-up girl for the Countryside Alliance, the pro-hunting lobby and the students of Aberdeen University, where she was the first woman lord rector (1999-2005). Clarissa wrote her autobiography, Spilling the Beans, in 2007 and produced several food books including A Sunday Roast (2002), The Game Cookbook (2004) and the prizewinning A History of English Food (2011). We used to share bookstalls at a regular summer conference of foodsters in Oxford and my wife always maintained that the skirt she was wearing this year was exactly the one she wore twelve months prior (same stains, same creases). For two days she would regale us with anecdotes, each more hair-raising, each more mordant \u2013 sometimes to be repeated the next year, sometimes not. Her style was inimitable and actually you didn&apos;t mind the odd repeat. She is survived by two sisters.Tom Jaine Mary Contini writes: Clarissa came into our shop, Valvona &amp; Crolla, more than 20 years ago, a bedraggled figure, eccentric and very, very posh. I had heard of her from her tenure at Books for Cooks in London: her reputation had preceded her. She had just moved to Edinburgh to open the Cook&apos;s Bookshop in the Grassmarket and was checking us out. Her venture was a huge success, becoming a haunt for chefs, tourists and food writers, welcomed by Clarissa sitting in front of a glowing wood fire, drinking tea and holding court. She also opened a cafe at Lennoxlove House, Haddington, the seat of the Duke of Hamilton. Meeting her led instantly to an enduring friendship. In our caff\u00e8 bar she held court, too, always on table seven, usually with an entourage of authors, food producers, family and celebrities. A constant critic of our efforts to provide good artisan local food and produce, she introduced us to suppliers and complimented us with abundance and generosity \u2013 but if we made a mistake or changed a recipe in a way she did not like, boy did she tell us. She loved her food highly seasoned, and our chefs knew when she was in to be on their guard: a bowl of chilli oil was prepared and extra salt put on the table. Simple dishes such as grilled meats or fish she had no time for: &quot;I can cook that myself at home.&quot; What she did favour were highly flavoured seasonal Italian dishes like Roman puntarelle with salsa acciughe, a bitter vegetable served with an ancient anchovy sauce, or scarola, bitter greens cooked with garlic, chilli, black olives and anchovies. Her favourite passion was fresh white truffles, which were served to her the same way every time: with homemade taglierini pasta, lots of Italian butter and black pepper. She was a great fun girl, loyally following the Italian music shows of my husband, Philip Contini, and was happiest when she had her special song, Fravula Fra, dedicated to her in the tiny theatre in the back of our caff\u00e8, where she sat always at the back of three rows of tightly packed chairs, laughing and cheering as he sang in Italian: &quot;I love your sweet cherry lips \u2013 but please don&apos;t eat the garlicky baccal\u00e0!&quot; He always translated this tale of flirting and salt cod before the song: she adored it, and the rest of the audience shared in her delight. \u2022 Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright, cook, bookshop owner, writer and broadcaster, born 24 June 1947; died 15 March 2014"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/annie-white-australia-policy", "sentences": ["The Singapore-based Malay newspaper Utusan Melayu said the deportation threatened the goodwill Australia had built up in supporting Indonesian independence."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-18T03:02:06Z", "title": "How one refugee signalled the end of the White Australia policy | Paul Power", "tags": ["Australia news", "Second world war", "Australian politics"], "article": "Sixty-five years ago today, a second world war refugee from Indonesia and her eight children achieved a stunning legal victory in the High Court of Australia. The case of Annie O\u2019Keefe and her family made international headlines, highlighting the cruel implementation of Australia\u2019s race-based immigration laws and the obstinacy of the immigration minister, Arthur Calwell. The action in the High Court was the first successful legal challenge to the White Australia Policy and was perhaps the first step towards the policy\u2019s ultimate abolition 24 years later. Annie O\u2019Keefe was among around 15,000 people who were evacuated to Australia from nearby countries during World War II and given sanctuary. While the Australian government was happy for the 10,000 or so wartime refugees of European background to remain in Australia, when the war was over it began work on forcing the 5,473 non-Europeans to leave. While the majority of the non-European refugees left voluntarily, by late 1948 Calwell and his department were turning their attention to forcing the removal of the 800 or so who remained. Annie had arrived in Australia in September 1942 at the age of 33 with her then husband Samuel Jacob and their seven children, being at risk because of the assistance Samuel had given Allied forces fighting the Japanese army in the Aru islands in Indonesia. They settled in the outer Melbourne community of Bonbeach, boarding in the home of John O\u2019Keefe, an unmarried retired postal worker. Shortly after his eighth child was born, Jacob returned to Indonesia to take part in a military mission. Before he left, he asked O\u2019Keefe to take care of Annie and the children if anything should happen to him. Jacob did not return, dying in a plane crash in September 1944. Because of the postwar unrest in Indonesia, Annie and her children were permitted to stay temporarily but by 1947 the Australian government began to pressure them to leave. O\u2019Keefe married Annie in June 1947, believing that the marriage would also allow Annie to remain in Australia and her children to continue their education in Bonbeach. However, the Government did not accept that the marriage conferred citizenship and issued a deportation order for Annie and the children in January 1949. When a local Catholic priest used the pulpit to attack the planned deportation, media and public interest grew quickly. Calwell received letters from all around Australia asking him to reverse the decision, and Sydney\u2019s Daily Telegraph set up a fighting fund which raised \u00a3747 in just five days for a legal challenge. Public criticism came from many quarters, including Labor party branch members, returned soldiers\u2019 groups and church members, among them Calwell\u2019s confidante Cardinal Daniel Mannix, the Catholic archbishop of Melbourne. While the Liberal-Country opposition strongly supported the White Australia Party, it saw Calwell\u2019s victimisation of individuals as foolish and likely to weaken support for the policy. Calwell responded in Parliament in February 1949, declaring that he had a responsibility \u201cto hand down this country to our children and our children\u2019s children in the same manner as we received it from our fathers and as they received it from their fathers\u201d. He continued: \u201cWe can have a white Australia, we can have a black Australia, but a mongrel Australia is impossible, and I shall not take the first steps to establish the precedents which will allow the floodgates to be opened.\u201d The Government\u2019s action drew wide criticism in southeast Asia. The Singapore-based Malay newspaper Utusan Melayu said the deportation threatened the goodwill Australia had built up in supporting Indonesian independence. Asians were trying to forget past indignities and understand Australia but Calwell\u2019s action was a great disappointment, the paper added, noting that Australia\u2019s support for Indonesia had \u201craised hopes among Asians generally that Australia realised her dependence on Asian goodwill for her future security\u201d.  Public financial support enabled the O\u2019Keefe family to challenge the deportation order. On 18 March 1949, the High Court of Australia, in a 4-2 decision, ruled that the immigration department did not have the power to deport Annie O\u2019Keefe because she had not been declared a prohibited immigrant when she arrived in Australia. The decision was received with great joy in Bonbeach.  Newspapers reported that neighbours rushed to Mrs O\u2019Keefe\u2019s home to tell her the news and that the O\u2019Keefe children\u2019s classmates at St Joseph\u2019s School cheered when the nuns shared the result of the court case. Mrs O\u2019Keefe declared herself \u201cdrunk with happiness\u201d and began planning an Indonesian-style party on the beach at which she would serve nasi goreng (described to newspaper readers as \u201ca spicy Indonesian dish\u201d). Calwell immediately declared his intention to introduce legislation to close the loophole revealed by the High Court decision. His legislation, which became the Wartime Refugees Removal Act, was passed by the Parliament with the opposition of only two MPs \u2013 the left-wing independents Jack Lang and Doris Blackburn. It took effect on 12 July 1949, giving the minister wide powers to designate which wartime refugees could be deported and introducing jail sentences for people who harboured them.  While the Liberal-Country coalition supported the legislation, it did not have the same enthusiasm for its implementation, particularly as public opposition to Calwell\u2019s hardheartedness grew. Calwell\u2019s treatment of a Philippines-born US Army sergeant Lorenzo Gamboa who had married an Australian woman in 1943 caused such outrage in the Philippines that the national parliament passed the Reciprocity Immigration Bill. If it had been enacted, the legislation would have prevented Australians from entering the Philippines. Before Calwell had the opportunity to force the deportation of many of the people targeted by his legislation, the Chifley Labor Government faced the electors and, in December 1949, was swept from office. In January 1950, the Menzies government\u2019s new immigration minister Harold Holt declared that the remaining wartime refugees merited special consideration and would be allowed to stay.

Ten days later, there is still more confusion and misinformation than solid evidence, and the aircraft with 239 people on board is still missing. Saturday 8 March           Faith leaders gather at Kuala Lumpur airport on Sunday to pray for passengers of a Malaysian Airlines flight that has been missing for more than a day    Just hours after the 12.40am flight disappeared the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said the plane was still in contact with air traffic controllers about two hours into the flight, pinning the last contact at about 2.40am [all times local], at a point 120 nautical miles off the east coast of Malaysia. But FlightAware, a flight-tracking website, showed the plane climbing to 10,700 metres (35,000ft) before disappearing from records at 1am, about 20 minutes after it took off. At 1am, the plane was scheduled to enter Vietnamese air space while flying between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City and did not. No distress signal was issued.     Malay authorities initially said contact was lost at 1.20am on Saturday headed towards Vietnam    Twelve hours after the plane vanished, search and rescue teams from Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam began looking for debris or wreckage off Vietnam. China and the Philippines soon sent their own ships and aircraft to help. A few hours later, a Vietnamese admiral told media the aircraft could have crashed in Vietnamese waters near an island \u2013 with reports of a giant oil slick and column of smoke emerging. Soon, questions over whether terrorism was involved began circulating after an Italian and an Austrian came forward to say they had not flown on the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, despite being listed in the flight\u2019s manifest. Sunday     MH 370\u2019s last communication to Malaysian air control \u2013 \u201cAll right, good night\u201d \u2013 came minutes before the plane disappeared    Teams from the US began aiding the search. Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Najib Razak, said terrorism was a possibility as authorities began investigating reports that as many as four people on board MH370 may have been using stolen passports. Later that day, a Japan-bound pilot from another Boeing 777 claimed to have made contact with MH370 at 1.30am, minutes before it disappeared, saying he had asked the aircraft if it had entered Vietnamese airspace, but received only static and mumbling in return. Vietnam claimed to have found more debris, while the Malaysian transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, told reporters the aircraft may have turned back towards Malaysia. Later that day it emerged that the Italian and Austrian men believed to be on board the flight had had their passports stolen in Thailand within the past two years, prompting fears that the men using their passports were terrorists. Monday      Chinese satellite imagery appeared to show debris floating to the east of what would have been MH370's flight path    Malaysia\u2019s aviation chief, Aharuddin Abdul Rahman, stoked fears of a terrorist plot when he said five passengers had checked in but never boarded the flight. Authorities denied Vietnamese reports that debris had been found, with the oil slick believed to belong to the plane revealed to be from a ship, while the \u201clife raft\u201d spotted off the coast of Vietnam turned out to be a moss-covered cable reel. CCTV footage of the two men travelling on stolen European passports prompted Malaysian officials to describe them as resembling the black Italian striker Mario Balotelli. Najib demanded a review of Kuala Lumpur\u2019s security measures. Tuesday     A report in the Wall Street Journal said the Boeing's engines had transmitted data to maintenance engineers for four hours beyond its last sighting    Malaysia Airlines said the pilots may have tried to turn the plane back towards Malaysia as the country widened its search and provided more teams. In a bizarre twist, Malaysia\u2019s air force chief Tan Sri Rodzali Daud said the plane had been detected at 2.40am near Pulau Perak, an island in the Malacca strait \u2013 indicating the plane had indeed flown back and was accounted for a whole hour later after it initially disappeared. He would later deny this claim. Earlier fears of terrorism were slightly assuaged as Interpol said more information had emerged about the men who travelled on stolen passports that indicated terrorism was less likely. Interpol named the two as Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, 19, and Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29, both from Iran. Reports suggested they were asylum seekers rather than terrorists. Wednesday     Military radar reported by Reuters has suggested the plane could have taken a path north-west to the Andaman Islands    Rodzali said the last radar signal from the missing aircraft was received 200 miles north-west of Penang at 2.15am on Saturday \u2013 a third potential last sighting. This would put the last signal at 45 minutes after authorities had initially said they lost contact. However, Daud said the data had not been received in real time, so it could have belonged to another aircraft. \u201cI\u2019m not saying this is MH370. We are still corroborating this,\u201d he told a press conference. \u201cThere is a possibility of the aircraft making a comeback. It remains as a possibility \u2026 It is very difficult to say for sure it is the aircraft.\u201d           Malaysian minister says the search for flight MH370 has been extended to two areas in the Straits of Malacca and the South China Sea    Unconfirmed reports also emerged of Malaysian fishermen spotting what looked like a life raft with the word \u201cBoarding\u201d on it floating off the east coast of Malaysia, although it is believed to have sunk when authorities attempted to bring it back to shore, while the Beijing News claimed that a dead body was seen in the Malacca strait wearing a life vest. Thursday     The Beijing News claimed a dead a body in a life raft had been sighted in the Malacca Strait. Fishermen claimed to have seen a life raft some 10 nautical miles from Port Dickson    Sources \u201cfamiliar with the details\u201d of the missing Boeing 777 told the Wall Street Journal that US investigators believed the plane had flown for a total of five hours, indicating it have been diverted \u201cwith the intention of using it later for another purpose\u201d. The theory was apparently based on data from the Boeing\u2019s engines, manufactured by the British company Rolls-Royce, sent to the ground. However, Malaysian officials denied that the engines transmitted any data past 1.07am.Malaysian authorities also said the plane was again caught on radar at 2.30am \u2013 this was later denied \u2013 and on military radar at 2.15am near the Malacca strait, indicating the plane had turned away from its flight path towards Beijing. Friday     The search area is extended into the Malaysian peninsula, the Malacca strait and Andaman Sea. It now includes 27,999 square nautical miles    With almost a week gone, a new theory emerged: a report based on radar-trafficking suggesting MH370 may have flown deliberately off course towards the Andaman Islands after it last made contact with air traffic control. Sources told Reuters the flight path of an unidentified aircraft investigators believed to be MH370 was following a route with specific navigational waypoints, suggesting someone with aviation training was at the helm.           Malaysia\u2019s acting transport minister on the latest developments in the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370    On the same day came reports that the aircraft\u2019s two communications systems were shut down, with \u201cmanual intervention\u201d the probable cause. According to two US officials who spoke to ABC News, the 777\u2019s data reporting system was shut down at 1.07am, while the transponder \u2013 which sends back information to civilian radar regarding performance, location and altitude \u2013 was turned off at 1.21am.  At a press conference late on Friday afternoon, Hishammuddin, Malaysia\u2019s acting transport minister, said authorities were investigating the possibility that the plane\u2019s communications systems had been deliberately shut down and said there were \u201cfour or five possibilities\u201d. Hishammuddin confirmed that MH370\u2019s \u201cwhole passenger manifest\u201d, including crew, was being looked into and added: \u201cIf investigation requires searching the pilots\u2019 homes, it will be done.\u201d Saturday In perhaps the most dramatic twist to the story so far Najib confirmed that the plane\u2019s communications systems had been deliberately turned off and that the jet had seemingly flown on for another six hours after contact was lost.  Addressing a press conference Malaysia\u2019s prime minister said that while the transponder and Acars data system were turned off early in the flight, the plane communicated with satellite seven hours after it took off.            Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak delivers a statement on Saturday, revealing new information in the search for missing flight MH370    The satellite communication could only determine that the plane took one of two huge flight corridors following its last confirmed location at 2.15am a week before over the Malacca strait \u2013 south from Indonesia towards the Indian Ocean; or north from Thailand towards central Asia. \u201cThese movements are consistent with deliberate action by someone on the plane,\u201d Najib said, saying attention was being focused on potential motives for those among the crew or passengers. Malaysian police began searching the home of the plane\u2019s 53-year-old captain, Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Sunday     Malaysian officials have requested official assistance from fifteen countries in south-east and south Asia to find MH 370 after satellite data indicated the aircraft flew on for hours after it last made contact with civilian radar    Malaysian investigators said the last voice communication from MH370 \u2013 a brief message to ground controllers saying \u201cAll right, good night\u201d \u2013 came after the first set of communication systems was disabled. This placed yet more focus on the potential actions of Zaharie and his 27-year-old co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, with their families interviewed. There were now 25 countries helping with the vast search, including Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia, with special assistance regarding satellite data from the US, China and France. Monday Malaysia said it believed the final spoken words from the plane came from Fariq, the co-pilot, not his colleague or an intruder on the flight deck. However, they appeared to backtrack from their earlier belief that the words were spoken after communications devices were deliberately switched off.           The co-pilot of the missing Malaysian plane\u2019s last words heard from the cockpit were \u2018all right, good night\u2019, according to the airline\u2019s chief executive    The voice communication came at 1.19am, two minutes before the plane\u2019s transponder was seemingly turned off. While the last signal from the Acars data communication system came earlier, at 1.07am, it was not due to transmit again until 30 minutes later, Hishammuddin, the interim transport minister, told reporters, meaning that could have seemingly been turned off at any point before 1.37am. Despite increased focus on the potential actions of the pilot and co-pilot, no possible motive or connection to extremist beliefs had emerged, with friends and family describing them as moderate and balanced. Tuesday     Australian aircraft conduct search operations in an area of 600,000 sq km off the western Australian coast. Photograph: Xinhua/Rex    In yet another indication that someone with a high degree of knowledge about airliners was behind MH370\u2019s change of course, the New York Times said the initial westward turn by the plane came about not through use of the manual controls but after a flight computer was reprogrammed, most likely by someone in the cockpit. Quoting unnamed US officials, the paper said such an operation would have to be carried out by someone with considerable knowledge of such systems. At yet another press briefing, Hishammuddin said the search for the plane had \u201centered a new phase\u201d of international co-operation, with other countries taking on an increased role. The entire search area, he said, was now 2.24m square nautical miles. With no definite news about what might have happened to the plane and the people on board, the father of one Chinese passenger told reporters he and other relatives were considering staging a hunger strike to push for more answers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/19/mh370-plane-search-sweeps-far-to-north-and-south-of-equator", "sentences": ["Ian Storey, a senior fellow at Singapore\u2019s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, told Reuters: \u201cInformation and intelligence exchange is very sensitive in this part of the world where there is a lot of distrust and sovereign issues.", "\u201cThere are all these polarising theories with so little definitive information that is verified,\u201d Paul Yap, an aviation lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore, told Agence France-Presse."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T06:59:53Z", "title": "MH370: plane search sweeps far to north and south of equator", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Plane crashes", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Twenty-six countries have continued searching two vast arcs of land and sea for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, with no sign of a breakthrough in the investigation 11 days after flight MH370 vanished. The search area now covers 2.24m square nautical miles \u2013 an area larger than Australia and stretching from central Asia down to the southern Indian Ocean. The Boeing 777 vanished early on 8 March en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 227 passengers and 12 crew on board. Malaysian officials have said they believe the plane was diverted deliberately but are not ruling out any possible reasons for the change of course. Police in the Maldives said they were investigating reports that people on one of its outer islands had seen a low-flying plane early on 8 March but gave no further details. Media reports have suggested that residents saw a low-flying white plane with red or blue markings but there have been previous potential sightings that do not appear to have been borne out, adding to the anguish of waiting families. \u201cPersonally I hope it has been hijacked and she is still alive,\u201d said Wang Yongzhi, from Beijing, whose wife was on flight MH370. \u201cBut from a practical, scientific point of view I know it has been quite a long time. Probably bad luck outweighs the good.\u201d On Tuesday Malaysian officials urged countries on the plane\u2019s potential path to reanalyse their military radar data in the hope of narrowing down the area \u2013 which comprises two great arcs sweeping north towards Kazakhstan and deep into the southern Indian Ocean far off the coast of Australia. A coalition of 26 countries is looking for the aeroplane, which vanished on 8 March with 239 people aboard en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. China said it had deployed 21 of its satellites. Several countries including Laos and Kazakhstan have said there is no evidence MH370 entered their airspace after diverting from its route to Beijing. \u201cThis is an enormous search area. And it is something that Malaysia cannot possibly search on its own,\u201d said the Malaysian transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein. \u201cAll efforts are being used now to reduce the [search] area \u2013 looking at satellite data; seeking assistance from other friends who have satellite capability; asking if they have looked [at radar data] to relook at them; finally, the use of assets whether in air or at sea.\u201dThailand was criticised for taking 10 days to state that its military radar information appeared to back up Malaysia\u2019s own data about the plane\u2019s apparent passage over the Malacca Strait. The Thai authorities said they did not release the details earlier because they had not received a specific request.  Ian Storey, a senior fellow at Singapore\u2019s Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, told Reuters: \u201cInformation and intelligence exchange is very sensitive in this part of the world where there is a lot of distrust and sovereign issues.   \u201cCountries are unwilling to share sensitive intelligence because it reveals their military capabilities \u2013 or lack of capabilities.\u201d Hishammuddin said China and Kazakhstan were taking the lead in the search of the northern arc, while Indonesia and Australia were taking charge in the south. Earlier the Chinese ambassador to Malaysia said the country had begun searching its own territory for any sign of the plane. Huang Huikang also said extensive checks on all Chinese passengers on board MH370 found no evidence they were involved in the diversion of the plane. A multinational team of investigators has established that the plane\u2019s last contact with satellites was at 8.11am but so far they have not fixed its location at that time any more specifically than along the sweeping search arcs. More than 150 Chinese nationals were among the 239 people on the Beijing-bound flight when it disappeared. Investigators say they are looking into the background of all crew, ground staff and passengers.  State news agency Xinhua reported that the country\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, rang the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, on Monday asking him to provide Beijing with more detailed and timely information. While China has urged Malaysia to be more transparent, its foreign ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, declined to give any details of its own search \u2013 such as when it began to search its own territory, which agencies were involved and what regions were covered. With so many days having passed since the plane disappeared, some now wonder if the puzzle may ever be solved: \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery and it may remain a mystery,\u201d says Elizabeth Quintalla, chief air power researcher at the Royal United Services Institute in London. The lack of progress in the investigation has bred numerous theories about the case, from prosaic discussions of possible mechanical failures to highly outlandish conspiracy theories. Few seem capable of explaining the disappearance entirely but with so few facts available it is hard to disprove any of them. \u201cThere are all these polarising theories with so little definitive information that is verified,\u201d Paul Yap, an aviation lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore, told Agence France-Presse. \u201cEverything that is not denied so far is being considered to be true, making a lot of theories quite plausible and that makes it even more difficult.\u201d  One theory that has emerged is that some kind of emergency prompted the pilots to divert to attempt a landing on a Malaysian runway, turning the flight westwards. The transponder \u2013 an identifying device that replies to radar signals from the ground \u2013 appears to have switched off two minutes after the last verbal communication with air traffic control. The Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said a malfunction could not be ruled out. While an onboard plane-to-ground monitoring system known as Acars had stopped sending data back to base, the plane\u2019s satellite transmitter had continued to communicate its presence to satellites until 8.11am. \u201cThere [was] some functionality in the system, except the reporting system was disabled,\u201d he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/bosch-edf-gsk-panasonic-veolia-invest-singapore-tech", "sentences": ["When it comes to sustainability ambitions, Singapore might take the prize.", "Moreover, its Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, which the government released in 2009, sets a target of certifying 80% of its buildings as green by 2030.", "And the sustainability push extends beyond buildings and civic services: Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technological University is shooting for greenest eco-campus in the world, with a 35% reduction in energy, water and waste by 2020.", "Chee Kiong Goh, executive director for cleantech and infrastructure at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said Singapore&apos;s national targets demonstrate its push towards environmental sustainability.", "Singapore&apos;s lack of land and natural resources also means the country must focus on sustainability,&quot; Goh said.", "The Economist Intelligence Unit&apos;s Asian Green City Index (pdf) ranks Singapore at the top of its list.", "Meanwhile, global corporations \u2013 including Panasonic, Bosch, EDF and Veolia \u2013 are investing in helping Singapore reach its goals with innovative tech solutions.", "Corporate partnerships Singapore&apos;s corporate-driven sustainability projects extend to almost every aspect of society.", "In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline and Singapore&apos;s EDB formed a 10-year, $33m partnership for advancing green manufacturing in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries.", "Meanwhile, EDF and Veolia are helping Singapore&apos;s Housing &amp; Development Board, the country&apos;s largest urban housing developer, to build out an urban modeling IT tool.", "On the transportation front, Bosch Software Innovations recently concluded the first phase of its investigation into the technical and commercial viability of electric vehicles in Singapore.", "Singapore as a springboard Singapore makes a sensible test bed for new products and ideas, many of which could be applied to other countries, experts say.", "Manoj Singh, global chief operating officer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, added that the lessons corporations learn from sustainability initiatives in Singapore will be highly transferrable elsewhere in Asia: &quot;The Singapore experience allows corporations to cut their teeth, test and actually implement the projects elsewhere, avoiding the same startup costs.&quot; Challenges ahead Vermeer cautioned, however, that companies innovating in Singapore might only be buying an &quot;option on the future&quot;.", "&quot;Water solutions are growing in importance to address situations like California&apos;s profound drought, while Europe is rolling back their carbon reduction and renewable energy commitments due to a changing economic and energy natural gas landscape.&quot; Meanwhile, environmental challenges prevail in Singapore and throughout Asia.", "&quot;But change is a necessity and public-private partnerships will be an increasing focus and a corner suite agenda in the next 10 years \u2013 not just in Singapore, but [also in] other Asia centers where sustainability is a heavy focus,&quot; he said.", "A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Singapore aims to achieve water self-sufficiency by 2050."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T21:53:00Z", "title": "Why Bosch, EDF and others are investing in Singapore", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Technology", "Emerging markets", "Smart cities", "Transport", "Environment", "Business", "Corporate social responsibility", "Ethical business"], "article": "When it comes to sustainability ambitions, Singapore might take the prize. The island nation, which currently relies on neighboring Malaysia for its water, is aiming for water self-sufficiency by 2060, with 55% of its water needs met via recycled water and 25% from seawater desalination.  Moreover, its Sustainable Singapore Blueprint, which the government released in 2009, sets a target of certifying 80% of its buildings as green by 2030. And the sustainability push extends beyond buildings and civic services: Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technological University is shooting for greenest eco-campus in the world, with a 35% reduction in energy, water and waste by 2020.  Chee Kiong Goh, executive director for cleantech and infrastructure at the Singapore Economic Development Board, said Singapore&apos;s national targets demonstrate its push towards environmental sustainability. &quot;Overcrowding is a big problem here and throughout Asia \u2013 Asian cities are growing at a rate of 37 million (residents) a year.

Using 3-D visualization and simulation techniques, planners can simulate complex scenarios to determine which planning strategies to pursue. The tool, which is currently being used in the Jurong East residential district, assesses buildings&apos; energy efficiency, air-conditioning systems, domestic waste collection and solar panel integration.  On the transportation front, Bosch Software Innovations recently concluded the first phase of its investigation into the technical and commercial viability of electric vehicles in Singapore. The island already has 111 charging stations, and Bosch hopes to expand into car sharing and commercial fleets, said Thomas Jakob, Bosch&apos;s managing director for the Asia Pacific region.  Singapore as a springboard Singapore makes a sensible test bed for new products and ideas, many of which could be applied to other countries, experts say. &quot;The companies can move more quickly and try more radical approaches than they could in less resource-constrained markets, while also being ready when the market begins to demand these solutions,&quot; said Daniel Vermeer, founder and director of Duke University&apos;s Center for Energy, Development and the Global Environment. Manoj Singh, global chief operating officer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, added that the lessons corporations learn from sustainability initiatives in Singapore will be highly transferrable elsewhere in Asia: &quot;The Singapore experience allows corporations to cut their teeth, test and actually implement the projects elsewhere, avoiding the same startup costs.&quot; Challenges ahead Vermeer cautioned, however, that companies innovating in Singapore might only be buying an &quot;option on the future&quot;. To ultimately succeed in emerging markets, they will still need to diversify their bets and learn the right lessons from their experiments. And they face the risk that the generally glacial pace of change in many of the big markets may not be sufficient to meet their needs.  &quot;The global picture is mixed,&quot; Vermeer said. &quot;Water solutions are growing in importance to address situations like California&apos;s profound drought, while Europe is rolling back their carbon reduction and renewable energy commitments due to a changing economic and energy natural gas landscape.&quot; Meanwhile, environmental challenges prevail in Singapore and throughout Asia.  China and Malaysia, among other Asian countries, have recently recorded dangerous levels of air pollution. Population trends also place a strain on sustainability. A Siemens Report, cited by the Economist Intelligence Unit (pdf), estimates that Asian populations living in cities will exceed 50% by 2026. Many of these urban areas are already strained by economic growth and migration. Asia&apos;s environmental challenges are acute, Singh said, adding that solving those problems will require formidable change. &quot;But change is a necessity and public-private partnerships will be an increasing focus and a corner suite agenda in the next 10 years \u2013 not just in Singapore, but [also in] other Asia centers where sustainability is a heavy focus,&quot; he said.

It played a month&apos;s run at the Royal Court back in 2010 but, despite some speculation about a potential West End run, that was the last we saw of it. Raine&apos;s play has, however, been a huge international success. It has been seen in 15 different countries \u2013 three times as many as War Horse \u2013 and in some cases had multiple productions. The US has already run 14 different professional productions, with another 10 lined up. By the end of 2014 it will have had more professional productions outside the UK than its British premiere had performances. Tribes is not alone in its extensive international life. Duncan Macmillan&apos;s Lungs has been Lunger, Longen, Pulmons and Atmen (Danish, Dutch, Spanish and German) in some of its 15-odd productions since 2011, and there are several more en route. Nick Payne&apos;s Constellations \u2013 also a two-hander \u2013 has proved another strong traveller, although it&apos;s still awaiting a US premiere. Britain is, and has always been, very good at exporting plays. &quot;If you&apos;re sitting anywhere else on planet earth, you know that this country is the country that produces plays,&quot; says director Ramin Gray, a former international associate at the Royal Court. &quot;Wherever you are, you&apos;ll see more British plays than anything else \u2013 apart from maybe Neil Simon. On the whole, British plays have a better build quality.&quot; What&apos;s curious though is that we rarely hear of such successes. Invariably, when we talk of British theatre overseas, we mean productions. War Horse, Matilda, Les Mis\u00e9rables: production franchises, global brands. Otherwise we might refer to smaller touring operations, such as 1927 or The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart. We don&apos;t generally think of British plays revived by local creative teams as a British success story. When culture secretary Maria Miller stressed the importance of cultural exports at the British Museum last April, she name-checked War Horse, Matilda, Shakespeare&apos;s Globe and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. &quot;British culture is perhaps the most powerful and compelling product we have available to us,&quot; she said. Miller stressed the need to make the economic case that day, so why aren&apos;t Britain&apos;s new writing organisations shouting about their international reach? In Battalions, Fin Kennedy&apos;s survey designed to present a case for the sector, makes little mention of it. Bureau de change International revivals can be remarkably lucrative. Rights for a single territory can fetch between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000, depending on the size of the theatre and nature of the production, with premieres at the top end. That makes it quite possible for a playwright to earn a six-figure sum off the back of a single play. It&apos;s that, says Raine, which can make being a playwright &quot;completely viable&quot;. Commissioning fees are not particularly lucrative in theatre and a playwright would need several major commissions a year for a reasonable salary. Instead it is royalties and rights that pay dividends over time \u2013 sometimes more so than television. &quot;The money in TV is better to begin with,&quot; says Raine. &quot;But the slow-burn of plays is such that it can earn you enough money that you don&apos;t continually have to write TV treatments for the quick buck. You write a play and it carries on earning.&quot; Her debut, Rabbit, which premiered at the Old Red Lion in 2006 after three years of rejection letters, still gets professional productions around the world eight years on. &quot;You write this play and put it on in a pub theatre and, eventually, it earns you more money than you&apos;ve ever earned writing TV. You wouldn&apos;t think that would be the case, but it actually is.&quot; Of course, only a small percentage of plays get international productions and fewer still are revived regularly enough to create a reliable income stream. Macmillan admits that he &quot;wouldn&apos;t be able to live off the income of international productions of Lungs&quot;. But the old adage that says you can&apos;t make a living from theatre, only a killing, holds true to some extent. Think how regularly a modern classic like The Weir has been revived globally since its 1997 premiere. A new frontier The difficulty is that it&apos;s just not possible to predict which plays will go global. Debbie Isitt&apos;s marital comedy, The Woman Who Cooked Her Husband, is usually on stage somewhere, while Marie Jones&apos;s Stones In His Pockets is an unlikely Scandinavian favourite. That leaves venues unable to bank on such income. As the Royal Court&apos;s executive director Lucy Davies explains: &quot;We get participation in future royalties, but only when the writer has reached a certain threshold within a certain window of time. We certainly don&apos;t budget for it and we don&apos;t expect it.&quot; That&apos;s despite Royal Court plays having had 70 productions around the world in the past three years alone. &quot;The work isn&apos;t a massive income stream for us, but it&apos;s brilliant for our reputation,&quot; adds Davies. Plus, if it&apos;s good for the Royal Court&apos;s playwrights, it&apos;s good for the Royal Court. There has always, as Gray says, been interest in British plays, but it&apos;s fair to say that the international marketplace has expanded in a few ways. First, we&apos;re seeing an increase in international collaborations. New territories have opened up \u2013 China, Singapore, Malaysia \u2013 but the speed of turnaround has also drastically increased. The internet has also made it easier to stay connected to far-off theatre locales and their critical and commercial hits. An increasingly connected global society has also meant that plays can become more universal in their concerns. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

Rinehart\u2019s company Hancock Prospecting signed a US$7.2bn (A$7.98bn) funding package for the US$10bn Pilbara mine and railway in Singapore on Thursday. The Roy Hill iron ore mine will be more than 70% debt funded. The move comes more than 60 years after Rinehart\u2019s father, Lang Hancock, discovered the world\u2019s largest iron ore deposit in Western Australia\u2019s Pilbara. Roy Hill\u2019s chief executive, Barry Fitzgerald, said the funding package was the biggest of its kind in the world. The funding from an international consortium of 19 banks, including Australia\u2019s big four lenders, is a vote of confidence in the mine despite falling iron ore prices and warnings of oversupply and less demand out of China. The mine is due to start exporting next year and when it ramps up to 55m tonnes a year it will be the world\u2019s fifth-biggest producer behind Andrew Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals. Rinehart described the project as a \u201ccrucible of opportunity during a period of global uncertainty\u201d. There are 2,500 people working on building the project, to rise to 3,600 later this year, with 2000 permanent staff to be employed at the operating mine. \u201cIt has already shown it will create new jobs and benefit the greater mining and construction-related industries,\u201d Rinehart said. \u201cIt will add to Australia\u2019s exports, and significantly benefit our West Australian and national economy.\u201d The mine will also enable Rinehart to operate a mine in her own right, with her near $20bn in current wealth attributable to her share of profits at the Rio Tinto-operated Hope Downs mine. Some commodity analysts warn the iron ore market is becoming oversupplied, which will make it harder for Roy Hill to be profitable. But senior resources analyst Gavin Wendt, a director of MineLife, disagrees, citing the quality of iron ore Roy Hill will produce. It is located in the same Pilbara region as the world\u2019s iron ore giants BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals. It will also not be wholly dependent on China, counting Japan\u2019s Marubeni and South Korea\u2019s Posco as major shareholders and export credit agencies and banks from those countries will supply much of the funding. Wendt pointed out that Japan and South Korea\u2019s more-developed economies produced a higher quality steel than China and demanded the high-quality product Roy Hill would produce. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been the biggest customers historically for Pilbara iron ore,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s demand for Pilbara-blend high-quality iron ore is also going to probably grow as it cracks down on inefficient high polluters in its steel industry. \u201cIt really is a triumph for her and good on her ... It is an important project, Roy Hill, as you don\u2019t typically find high-quality premium iron ore projects in low political-risk destinations like Australia.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2014/mar/21/circus-social-enterprise-developing-world", "sentences": ["Circus allows them to hide behind the prop and perform without being judged&quot; explains Jay Che, founder of Circus in Motion in Singapore.", "The organisation, which was recently named as one of Singapore&apos;s youth enterprises of 2013, have also worked with young offenders."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-21T07:02:00Z", "title": "How social enterprise circuses are impacting on disadvantaged youths", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Global development professionals network", "Social enterprises", "Society", "Circus", "Cirque du Soleil", "Social enterprise"], "article": "Teachers often tell students to stop &apos;clowning around&apos; but many social enterprises are doing the very opposite. Across the world, circus workshops are replacing lessons and demonstrating that laughter is the best medicine. Circuses are using workshops to educate communities on issues such as HIV, female genital mutilation and land mines. In South Africa, Zip Zap Circus School caters for vulnerable and homeless youths and Phare the Cambodian Circus is a popular tourist attraction that, among other things, promotes aspiring, young artists and performers. There are social enterprise circuses operating in the UK too. Circus Space, based at a former power station in London, Greentop, in Sheffield, and Organised Kaos, in the valleys of South Wales, are just a few. Regardless of geographical location these circuses are all connected by their passion to change young people&apos;s lives and inspire social and economic development. &quot;The beauty of the circus arts is that it gives marginalised youth, who are more likely to have low confidence, an opportunity to perform. Circus allows them to hide behind the prop and perform without being judged&quot; explains Jay Che, founder of Circus in Motion in Singapore. Circus in Motion has had much success delivering workshops for low achievers at school and children with mental disabilities. The organisation, which was recently named as one of Singapore&apos;s youth enterprises of 2013, have also worked with young offenders. Che, who previously worked with Cirque du Monde - the social arm of Cirque du Soleil - recognises circus training&apos;s potential to be a tool that can push those who misbehave and reward those who show promise. The rewards are plenty. &quot;Circus skills can be used to teach life skills, including perseverance, teamwork, trust and positive risk-taking,&quot; says Che. Young people can apply these life skills outside of the circus \u2013 which can help make them more employable and taking part in workshops can give a sense of self-worth while boosting their confidence. For vulnerable young people, especially those who have experienced conflict or trauma, the circus can be a form of escape, and a place where they share their experiences and express their emotions. &quot;Clowning provokes feelings of empathy among both the participants and the audience,&quot; explains Diana Calvo, co-founder of Outa Hamra. The Egyptian clowning theatre group that blends circus skills with street drama is part of the Nahdet el Mahrousa, an incubator for innovative social enterprises across the Middle East. They too provide workshops and teach disadvantaged youth a trick or two. Calvo says clowning around and performing circus tricks on streets brings local communities together and starts a conversation on social and political issues. &quot;I remember once, when a group of street children performed in front of members of the government and afterwards the children were asked questions. It must have been the first time they&apos;d been spoken to on an equal level \u2026 it&apos;s a powerful message.&quot; Messages are a cardinal part of these circuses. Each act or skill comes attached with its own deeper, symbolic meaning. Tightroping could represent an escape from conflict or trauma. While other acrobatic acts may reflect a seemingly impossible goal being achieved, which for most young people participating in the workshops is finding a job and being successful. It&apos;s not just new-found confidence and future job opportunities that these social circuses are creating; it&apos;s a support network that meets both the educational and psychological needs of the wider community. A circus with a purpose has an impact long after the young people have completed their workshops or successfully graduated. By being socially conscious, these enterprises recognise the role they can play in providing long-term stability, ensuring that social and economic development flourishes and continuing to inspire young people. &quot;We use everyday objects as props. We wear clothes from flea markets,&quot; gushes Calvo. &quot;We want to deliver the message that anyone can do what we do.&quot; For more news, opinions and ideas about the social enterprise sector, join our community."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/23/indonesia-forest-fires-pollution-asia", "sentences": ["They look harmless as the monsoon winds sweep them north and east towards Singapore, Malaysia and deep into Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.", "This time, the monsoon winds mostly spared Singapore but sent the thick smog from burning peat soils and vegetation over much of the region.", "Meanwhile, Singapore has proposed a law which would allow it to fine foreign companies for causing cross-border air pollution."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-22T21:52:52Z", "title": "Indonesia's forest fires feed 'brown cloud' of pollution choking Asia's cities", "tags": ["Pollution", "Environment", "Climate change", "Deforestation", "Conservation", "Trees and forests", "Indonesia", "China", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "High above the vast Indonesian island of Sumatra, satellites identify hundreds of plumes of smoke drifting over the oil palm plantations and rainforests. They look harmless as the monsoon winds sweep them north and east towards Singapore, Malaysia and deep into Cambodia, Laos and Thailand. But at ground level, south-east Asian cities have been choking for weeks, wreathed in an acrid, stinking blanket of half-burned vegetation mixed with industrial pollution, car exhaust fumes and ash. From Palangkarya in Borneo to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, the air has been thick, the sun a dull glow and face masks obligatory. Schools, airports and roads have been closed and visibility at times has been down to just a few yards. Communities have had to be evacuated and people advised to remain indoors, transport has been disrupted and more than 50,000 people have had to be treated for asthma, bronchitis and other respiratory illnesses in Sumatra alone. Last week more than 200 Malaysian schools were forced to close, and pollution twice reached officially hazardous levels. The Asian &quot;haze&quot;, which comes and goes with the wind and droughts, is back with a vengeance just eight months after an embarrassed Indonesian government promised it would never happen again and was forced to apologise to neighbouring countries for the pollution that blanketed the region in June 2013. Mixed with the dense photo-chemical smogs that regularly hang over most large traffic-choked Asian cities, south-east Asia&apos;s air pollution has become not just a major public health hazard but is said to be now threatening food production, tourism and economic expansion. In addition, say scientists, it may now be exacerbating climate change. According to Nasa satellite maps, more than 3,000 separate fires have been recorded across Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia since mid-January, more than in June 2013 when the pollution spiked to dangerous levels and became a regional diplomatic crisis. This time, the monsoon winds mostly spared Singapore but sent the thick smog from burning peat soils and vegetation over much of the region. Around 10 million people and an area the size of Britain and France have been affected. Just as in 2013, most of this year&apos;s fires appear to have been started in Riau province, northern Sumatra, the centre of the rampant Indonesian palm oil and pulp-paper industries. According to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, 70% of these fires were lit by landowners wanting to clear ground for more plantations. But while Indonesia is widely blamed for the air pollution, the latest satellite images show fires burning and haze spreading across Burma, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos and as far away as the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. What has surprised observers is the timing: the burning season, when farmers clear land, does not usually start for many months. Monitoring groups such as Walhi, the World Resources Institute and Greenpeace say the fires are linked both to the worst drought seen in years and corruption and inaction at government level. So far, says the Riau government, only a handful of suspects have been held for setting the fires. Nearly half are burning on land managed by large pulpwood, palm oil and logging companies that have turned the rainforest into a giant fire-prone region by clearing millions of acres for plantations, says Nigel Sizer of the Washington-based World Resources Institute, which uses satellite data to pinpoint hot spots. The corporations have denied involvement, saying the latest fires are illegally set. &quot;The fires are starting outside our forest concessions but with the heavy, circular winds they&apos;re jumping everywhere,&quot; said Kusnan Rahmin, president director of the pulp and paper manufacturer April Indonesia. Sizer says: &quot;Even if they did not start the fires, they are responsible for massive and dramatic clearing of forests in the regions that have been burning, and to some extent for the conflicts with local communities that may be starting fires to stake their claim to land awarded in concessions to the companies.&quot; &quot;Once ignited, peat fires are extremely difficult to extinguish and generate massive air pollution that contributes to the choking haze now blanketing much of Sumatra,&quot; says Rhett Butler, editor of the international forest conservation website Mongabay. Scientists now fear that the Asian haze will intensify and become an annual event as the population of the region rises to an estimated five billion people and climate change bites over the next 30 years. This week&apos;s IPCC report on the expected impacts of climate change will warn of the cities becoming uninhabitable for millions as temperatures rise. Droughts are expected to become longer and more intense and the number of extremely hot days to grow. Still unclear is how far the haze from burning forests feeds into Asia&apos;s rapidly worsening urban air pollution to form a semi-permanent toxic cloud thick enough to disrupt monsoons and weather patterns across the world and reduce sunlight and crop yields. From being more or less accepted as the inevitable price of industrial development and poverty reduction just a few years ago, air pollution has risen dramatically up the region&apos;s political agenda as the costs are counted. Asia is now the centre of global air pollution, which along with obesity is the world&apos;s fastest growing cause of death. Every year, says a recent Lancet report, more than 2.1 million people in Asia die prematurely from air pollution, mostly from the minute particles of diesel soot and gases emitted by cars and lorries, as well as half-burned vegetation from forest burning. Of these deaths, 1.2 million were in east Asia and China, and 712,000 in south Asia, including India. According to the Lancet report, by a consortium of universities working in conjunction with the UN, Asia loses more than 50m years of healthy life from fine particle air pollution per year. Air pollution also contributes to higher rates of cognitive decline, strokes and heart attacks, it says. In a separate report last month, the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences claimed that Asian air pollution was now affecting climate around the world and making cities like Beijing uninhabitable and suggestive of what a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; might be like. &quot;Pollution originating from Asia clearly has an impact on the upper atmosphere and it appears to make such storms or cyclones even stronger,&quot; says Renyi Zhang, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University and a co-author of the study with Nasa scientists. &quot;This pollution affects cloud formations, precipitation, storm intensity, and other factors and eventually impacts climate. Most likely, pollution from Asia can have important consequences on the weather pattern here over North America&quot;, said Zhang. The study backs UN research that suggests a layer of air pollution, the &quot;brown cloud&quot;, regularly covers the upper atmosphere over Asia between January and March and could precipitate an environmental disaster that could affect billions of people. It is, says scientists, the result of forest fires, the burning of agricultural wastes, dramatic increases in the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, industries and power stations, and emissions from millions of inefficient cookers burning wood and cow dung. &quot;The effects of the &apos;Asian brown cloud&apos; have been linked to the retreat, over the last half a century, of glaciers in the Himalayas that supply water to major rivers, including the Yangtse, the Ganges and the Indus,&quot; says co-author Harshal T. Pandve. Asian leaders have been slow to understand and act on air pollution, but are now aware of people&apos;s anger. China, embarrassed by air pollution before the 2008 Olympics, says it is now costing its economy $400bn a year, or 6% of its GDP. Beijing last month pledged $1.6bn to reward cities for tackling it and said it planned to close 300 factories. Meanwhile, Singapore has proposed a law which would allow it to fine foreign companies for causing cross-border air pollution. But observers say passing new laws will not be enough. In the Philippines, where car numbers are predicted to quadruple within 20 years, a brown cloud hangs over the mega-city of Metro Manila most days, despite higher standards for vehicles and draconian laws. &quot;Most Asian governments are still concerned with economic development to the detriment of everything else,&quot; says Vicky Segovia, of Manila&apos;s Clean Air partnership. &quot;We are not impressed by any of them.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/mh370-objects-indian-ocean-credible-lead", "sentences": ["&quot;I have seen images [of relatives] from Australia: very rational, understanding this is a global effort, not blaming Malaysia, because it is co-ordinating something unprecedented.&quot; Singapore&apos;s Straits Times reported that relatives berated the Malaysian ambassador and other officials at a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-26T12:44:25Z", "title": "MH370: 122 objects spotted in Indian Ocean are 'most credible lead yet'", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "Air transport", "China", "Plane crashes", "World news"], "article": "     Satellite imagery showing more than 122 possible objects floating in a patch of the southern Indian Ocean offers the most credible lead yet in the hunt for the missing Malaysian airliner, the country&apos;s transport minister has said. The items, estimated to measure between one and 23 metres, were spotted close to where Chinese and Australian aircraft earlier sighted possible debris, Hishammuddin Hussein added. Extra vessels and aircraft arrived in the search zone \u2013 around 1,500 miles (2,500km) south-west of Perth \u2013 on Wednesday, as crews resumed work after gale-force winds and heavy rain forced them to leave the area. But forecasters warned the multinational hunt might have to be suspended again on Thursday because of gales and storms. Twelve planes and two ships \u2013 Australia&apos;s HMAS Success and the Chinese polar supply ship Xue Long \u2013 were sweeping the zone, with South Korean aircraft joining the hunt for the first time. Malaysia says the total area being searched covers almost 470,000 square nautical miles. Despite several possible sightings of debris, no objects have been conclusively connected to MH370, which vanished on 8 March.      Family members of many of the 239 on board have said they cannot accept Malaysia&apos;s conclusion that the flight crashed into the ocean with the loss of all lives until they see physical evidence. Experts say the wreckage is also crucial to understanding what happened to the flight. Australia&apos;s prime minister said the country was throwing everything it had at the search, although the hunt was not open-ended. &quot;We are just going to keep on looking because we owe it to people to do everything we can to resolve this riddle,&quot; Tony Abbott told Nine Network. &quot;It is not absolutely open-ended but it is not something we will lightly abandon.&quot; But Hishammuddin told reporters: &quot;We will never give up trying to find the plane, to ensure closure for the families and find out what happened to MH370.&quot; He said the images were captured by Airbus Defence and Space in France on 23 March and showed 122 potential objects floating in an area of around 400 sq km, located 2,557km from Perth. &quot;Some appear to be bright, possibly indicating solid material,&quot; he added.      He stressed that there was no way of telling if the potential objects came from the Boeing 777, but added: &quot;[The area] is not far from the objects sighted by China and Australia. This is still the most credible lead that we have.&quot; Investigators are also attempting to further narrow down the plane&apos;s possible last location based on its communications with satellites and other factors, he said. He dismissed the widespread criticism that Malaysia has faced for its handling of the search and investigation, insisting that it had performed admirably in an unprecedented situation. &quot;I think history will judge us well,&quot; he told reporters. Earlier in the day, the transport minister said on Twitter that he had held an &quot;important and fruitful meeting&quot; with the Chinese special envoy dispatched to deal with the case. Zhang Yesui also met the prime minister, Najib Razak.      But Hishammuddin went on to implicitly criticise Chinese relatives who have accused Malaysia and Malaysia Airlines of lying to them and causing the deaths of their loved ones. Around 200 family members protested outside the embassy in Beijing on Tuesday, throwing plastic bottles and cursing diplomats who did not come out to meet them. &quot;Time will heal emotions that are running high \u2026 Chinese families must understand we in Malaysia also lost loved ones,&quot; said Hishammuddin. &quot;I have seen images [of relatives] from Australia: very rational, understanding this is a global effort, not blaming Malaysia, because it is co-ordinating something unprecedented.&quot; Singapore&apos;s Straits Times reported that relatives berated the Malaysian ambassador and other officials at a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday. The team told them that there was sealed evidence in the investigation \u2013 including the air traffic control radio transcript, radar data and airport security recordings \u2013 that could not be released. The ambassador, Iskandar Sarudin, declined to answer several questions. Earlier, families complained that the airline had shut its office at the hotel, that caregivers could not be found and that the 24-hour hotline for relatives was ringing unanswered. &quot;Each relative was taken care of by two special volunteers, but so far, all Malaysian Airlines crew mysteriously disappeared. Do they also lose contact?&quot; they asked via a microblog account named Malaysia Airlines MH370 Relatives Committee. A Malaysia Airlines official reportedly said the Chinese government had advised them not to come on Tuesday given the tense mood, and that there were around 50 caregivers in Beijing, spread over five hotels, because it had a problem finding volunteers. Investigators believe the plane was deliberately diverted by someone on board, but say they have not ruled out any possible explanations, from hijacking and sabotage to an attempt to deal with mechanical problems. &quot;We do not know why \u2026 We do not know how the terrible tragedy happened,&quot; the Malaysia Airlines chief executive, Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, said on Tuesday. CNN said an unnamed law enforcement official briefed on the investigation had told it that the plane&apos;s unscheduled turn to the west was believed to have been entered at least 12 minutes before the co-pilot signed off to Malaysian air traffic controllers with the words: &quot;All right, good night.&quot; But analysts differed on whether that could be part of an alternative flight plan programmed in case of emergency, or evidence of ill intent. A US law firm has announced it has started multimillion-dollar legal proceedings against Malaysia Airlines and Boeing. The Chicago-based Ribbeck Law Chartered International said it had filed a court petition in the US, seeking any documents relating to design or mechanical issues or conduct by the airline that could be related to the disaster. Its statement said: &quot;We believe that both defendants named are responsible for the disaster of flight MH370.&quot; It said it was acting on behalf of Januari Siregar, who lost his son in the crash, but gave no details of the damages sought beyond describing the litigation as a &quot;multimillion-dollar process&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/27/the-forgotten-story-of-perth-kangaroos", "sentences": ["Before the Glory, however, there was the Perth Kangaroos International Football Club, an all-conquering side that participated in the Singapore Premier League for one season in 1994.", "The idea for a Perth-based team to play in Singapore was announced in 1993, as a partnership between SAWA and a private consortium.", "\u201cWe needed to look at other ways of convincing the Federation that we were worthy of admission.\u201d In June 1993, Frank Schaper, the president of the Professional Soccer Association, flew to Singapore to discuss entering a team into the Singapore Premier League.", "We would get accustomed to the problems of travelling and would have a squad of players training full time as a unit unlike the combined teams that represent the state now.\u201d  Along with Darwin Cubs, a new side backed by Carlton and United Breweries in the Northern Territory, the Perth team were granted a three year licence to the Singapore Premier League, with an option to renegotiate after the first season.", "We want the crowds to come \u2026 we have actually given out about 10,000 tickets to the general public \u2013 not to the soccer fraternity here \u2013 because we want soccer to catch on in Western Australia.\u201d  However, the competition hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons as the team traveled to Singapore.", "\u201cKangaroos warned of Singapore bribes\u201d screamed the back page of the West Australian before their match against Tyrwhitt Soccerites.", "Match-fixing and bribery were alleged to be prevalent in Singapore, with many fans seen openly gambling on outcomes during the match.", "The bribery claims were not the only factor affecting the perception of the Kangaroos and the Singapore Premier League in Perth.", "\u201cThe Perth Kangaroos will win the Singapore championship after what I have seen here,\u201d said Jurong Town coach Krisnan Suppaiah.", "Promised big things by the Football Association of Singapore, including competitive matches and television exposure in Asia, instead, the competition was second rate and sponsors were hard to come by.", "\u201cThe players could easily have withdrawn from the venture and got paid by playing for their PSF clubs at the weekend,\u201d said coach Gary Marocchi after a 3-0 win over Singapore\u2019s Police Team in Singapore.", "In July, as attention increasingly turned towards entry into the NSL, the Kangaroos completed the formalities by taking out the Singapore Premier League title with a fortnight remaining in the competition.", "Turning in what Marocchi described as their \u201cworst performance at home\u201d, the Kangaroos still managed a 5-0 victory over Singapore Police at Dorrien Gardens.", "To this day, 20 years after Perth Kangaroos entered the Singapore Premier League, Mackay remains a foundation member of Perth Glory."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-26T23:26:04Z", "title": "The forgotten story of ... Perth Kangaroos", "tags": ["Perth Glory", "Australia sport", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Perth was always a bridge too far. Football, as Johnny Warren liked to say, was the first sport in Australia to go national. In 1977, the country&apos;s first national football competition, the National Soccer League, fielded teams from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Canberra. In 1978 Newcastle KB United entered the competition, but Western Australia remained the missing link. \u201cIt is everyone\u2019s wish,\u201d wrote Soccer Federation of Western Australia chairman Brian Le Fevre in 1978, \u201cthat in the long term Western Australia will be in a position to participate in the national competition.\u201d It would take almost two decades for Le Fevre\u2019s wish to come true. The story of Perth Glory\u2019s entry into the NSL in 1996-97 is now well known, and tends to dominate discussion of football in Western Australia. Before the Glory, however, there was the Perth Kangaroos International Football Club, an all-conquering side that participated in the Singapore Premier League for one season in 1994.  The story of the Perth Kangaroos is equal parts innovation, entrepreneurialism, betrayal and disorganisation. At the 1990 World Cup Tom Mackay \u2013 a former reporter for Scottish newspaper the Press and Journal - had a chance encounter with Sir Alex Ferguson. Ferguson and Mackay discussed why Australian football was not in better shape. \u201cYou have superb athletes, a strong economy, many migrants from countries where football is the major sport and a wonderful climate,\u201d Ferguson told Mackay. \u201cYet your country has only qualified once for the World Cup.\u201d According to Mackay, this conversation motivated him to become involved in the administration of the game in Western Australia, which had been his home since 1979. Upon his return, he was appointed president of the new Soccer Association of Western Australia. \u201cI made it very clear from the start that my main ambition was to get a Perth side into the national league,\u201d Mackay told Guardian Australia. The idea for a Perth-based team to play in Singapore was announced in 1993, as a partnership between SAWA and a private consortium. \u201cThis is the first time a team from any football code in Australia has played in a major competition in a foreign country,\u201d said Mackay at the time. \u201cWhoever wins the licence will be spearheading Australia&apos;s entry into the Asian soccer scene.\u201d By March, the Kangaroos were promising bumper crowds and high quality football. Perhaps the cancellation of the pre-season friendly in March should have served as a greater warning. The Kangaroos recruited all 29 of their initial squad from local State League clubs, with 10 selected from Perth Italia, a particularly strong side. Italia, unsurprisingly, were not happy. As the Kangaroos prepared to play Selangor in a friendly match, Perth Italia slapped writs on five key players \u2013 Gareth and Craig Naven, Dale Wingell, Vince Matassa and Paul Strudwick. The game was called off, Western Australia\u2019s sport and recreation minister, Norman Moore, called it a \u201cdebacle\u201d and SAWA was forced to quickly negotiate a compromise between the Kangaroos and the State League clubs. It was a sign of things to come. \u201cIt was one crisis after another,\u201d remembers Mackay. \u201cOne thing you need when forming a team like this is stability, and that\u2019s one thing that the Perth Kangaroos never ever had.\u201d Perth\u2019s Asian adventure was born out of the continued reluctance of the Australian Soccer Federation to establish a NSL team in Western Australia. During the 1980s, the NSL had become something of a holy grail for Western Australians. Richard Kreider&apos;s definitive history of Western Australian football, Paddocks to Pitches, notes that Spearwood Dalmatinac looked to join the league as early as 1983. In 1987, the merger of three Italian clubs \u2013 East Fremantle Tricolore, Balcatta Etna and Perth Azzuri \u2013 under the name Perth Italia was another effort to gain entry into the competition. Nick Tana was heavily involved in the merger. \u201cSelf interest was rife through the ASF at the time,\u201d Tana told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was clear that to do something in a national league you had to have all the states playing.\u201d  The push for a Perth team intensified after the 1990 Bradley Report to the ASF recommended wide-ranging reform to the national competition. Football was politically disorganised, financially destitute and losing the battle with mainstream Australia\u2019s thinly-veiled chauvinism towards ethnic-based clubs, which dominated the competition. Soccer was seen as a poor, foreign basket-case.  \u201cTo achieve the level of prestige required,\u201d wrote the report\u2019s author, Graham Bradley. \u201cThe competition needs to be truly national and include teams from all states.\u201d Bradley argued for the game to shed its \u201cethnic image\u201d and for steps to be taken to franchise the clubs. Further, Bradley recommended that \u201cevery state and major population centre in Australia should be represented\u201d, and financial arrangements be made to accommodate Perth, which, with most NSL clubs based on the eastern seaboard, would become one of the longest away trips in world football.  Much of the Bradley Report fell by the wayside as football\u2019s culture of political infighting and cronyism continued to stymie progress. Western Australia was one of the victims of this inertia, as the ASF flirted with the idea of establishing a team for several years without fully committing. Tom Mackay spent years lobbying the ASF in his role as president of SAWA. \u201cNearly all the other states delegates in the ASF opposed the proposal claiming Perth, an Aussie Rules stronghold, would not get enough spectator support\u201d, Mackay remembers. \u201cThe real reason why the eastern states were against a team from Perth was the extra money the ASF would have to find to cover the cost of team airfares between the east and west coast. Twenty years ago flights took longer, and none of the clubs in those days had money to help overcome the problems of airfares.\u201d  In early 1993, the ASF chief executive, Ian Holmes, commented \u201cthe sooner we have a team from Perth, and also the ACT, to create a truly national league, then the better.\u201d Teams from Perth were encouraged to table a bid to the governing body, while plans were also being made in football circles in New Zealand and Canberra. By March 1993, it was clear that the Perth bid would not eventuate. \u201cAfter more than three years of fruitless lobbying, I could see little prospect of the ASF admitting a Perth team to the competition,\u201d Mackay said. \u201cWe needed to look at other ways of convincing the Federation that we were worthy of admission.\u201d In June 1993, Frank Schaper, the president of the Professional Soccer Association, flew to Singapore to discuss entering a team into the Singapore Premier League. \u201cThe NSL is still the priority for us and we want to make sure we are the next team that is admitted,\u201d said acting secretary of SAWA, Richard Marles. \u201cIf it is a National League it should encompass the whole of Australia before it goes overseas.  \u201cBut the Asian competition would certainly enable us to clear out a lot of the cobwebs. We would get accustomed to the problems of travelling and would have a squad of players training full time as a unit unlike the combined teams that represent the state now.\u201d  Along with Darwin Cubs, a new side backed by Carlton and United Breweries in the Northern Territory, the Perth team were granted a three year licence to the Singapore Premier League, with an option to renegotiate after the first season. Schaper, a key figure in organising the venture, resigned from the PSF to head up the Global Football Australia, the organisation that ran the team. Mackay was appointed to the board of GFA to \u201ckeep an eye on things\u201d for SAWA. The Kangaroos name was chosen by popular demand, the team was linked with National Basketball League side Perth Wildcats, while Radio 6NR came on board to broadcast the games. British football show Futball Mundial commissioned a feature story on the Kangaroos, to be shown on ABC. Like the rest of the country, football in Perth was deeply rooted in immigrant and ethnic communities. This new team was supposed to broaden that base. The Kangaroos targeted \u2018mainstream\u2019 Australia.     Perth Kangaroos gave away tickets in promotions in order to publicise football in WA. Photograph: /Richard Kreider    Perth Kangaroos won their first match against Gibraltar Crescent 2-0, which was followed up by a 4-1 drubbing of Geylang International. Before the match against Gibraltar Crescent, Schaper said, \u201cthe result would be quite irrelevant to me. We want the crowds to come \u2026 we have actually given out about 10,000 tickets to the general public \u2013 not to the soccer fraternity here \u2013 because we want soccer to catch on in Western Australia.\u201d  However, the competition hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons as the team traveled to Singapore. \u201cKangaroos warned of Singapore bribes\u201d screamed the back page of the West Australian before their match against Tyrwhitt Soccerites. Match-fixing and bribery were alleged to be prevalent in Singapore, with many fans seen openly gambling on outcomes during the match. According to the West Australian\u2019s football reporter Mel Moffat \u201cillegal betting on the outcome of the game was clearly evident.\u201d Tyrwhitt\u2019s Croatian goalkeeper was jeered off the field when fans alleged that he had succumbed to a bribe, while supporters who had placed bets on a 2-0 outcome pleaded with Kangaroos players to not score any more goals. The Kangaroos won 3-0. The bribery claims were not the only factor affecting the perception of the Kangaroos and the Singapore Premier League in Perth. It became clear that the Australian sides were simply too good for the opposition. After just a few rounds both Perth and Darwin Cubs had raced to the top of the table with impressive goal differences.  On 17 April, the Kangaroos thumped Jurong Town 11-0 at home, with Paul McVittie and Paul Strudwick scoring a hat-trick each. The first goal came after just 80 seconds, when McVittie headed home Strudwick\u2019s cross. \u201cThe Perth Kangaroos will win the Singapore championship after what I have seen here,\u201d said Jurong Town coach Krisnan Suppaiah. The locals were less impressed \u2013 \u201cthe one-sided nature of the contest might have done the credibility of the competition more harm than good\u201d wrote Moffat in the West Australian. Meanwhile, in the State League, infighting continued to plague the sport. Plans were made to force clubs to de-ethnicise their names after crowd trouble between Greek-backed Floreat Athena and Stirling Macedonia. The Australian government had formally recognised the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia earlier in the year, and, typically, the angst that went with the decision was played out on soccer fields around the country.  Despite the early setbacks, the Perth Kangaroos did put football in Perth in a brighter spotlight. Vince Matassa was told by national coach Eddie Thomson that he must play at a higher level than the State League in order to be considered for selection. \u201cThat\u2019s why it was vital that I was initially included in the Kangaroos squad\u201d Matassa told the West Australian. The Kangaroos were also a focal point for Thomson when he arrived in Perth to assess the local talent for his Olyroos squad. Moreover, Thomson threw his support behind Perth, commenting \u201cit\u2019s vital that Perth gets in the NSL. Players like Robert Zabica, Robbie Dunn and Stan Lazaridis would never have been capped for Australia had they stayed in Perth and there must be a lot more like them in Perth who could do likewise with proper exposure.\u201d In early May, rumours continued that Perth were in line for a NSL licence, with SAWA executive director Roger Lefort commenting that there was \u201cstrong interest\u201d shown by a private consortium who were willing to bankroll the club. However, the pitfalls of private ownership quickly became evident as Global Football Australia pulled out the Kangaroos venture, leaving players and coaches in the lurch mid-season. It was a horror week for the Kangaroos, who were forced to postpone their match against Balestier United after confusion over flights, as well as losing their major backer. Global\u2019s pullout came after they became increasingly disillusioned at the way in which the competition was being run. Promised big things by the Football Association of Singapore, including competitive matches and television exposure in Asia, instead, the competition was second rate and sponsors were hard to come by. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve been let down on several fronts,\u201d Mackay told the West Australian. \u201cThe FAS has not promoted the tournament vigorously, it withdrew the best players to keep them exclusively for the national team which plays in the Malaysian league, and it has not met commitments regarding TV coverage, which has harmed our chances of gaining sponsorship.\u201d With crisis looming, SAWA found a saviour in Arena Investments, a group of businessmen headed by Nick Tana, Paul Afkos and Anthony Di Francesco. Nick Tana had coveted an NSL spot since the merger of Perth Italia in 1987, and behind the scenes, Arena Investments were lobbying for a licence. \u201cAt the same time we were courting the eastern states to having a team from Western Australia in the national league,\u201d Tana told Guardian Australia. \u201cWe never went into it [Perth Kangaroos] with a view to continuing with it or expanding it or developing it. I suppose it was damage control so that it didn\u2019t spill over onto our purposes and our plans.  \u201cWe knew that getting into the national league was going to be an expense. The last thing we needed was a distraction like the Kangaroos to add to the expense. I suppose it\u2019s like insurance. We had to take out the insurance of finishing off that season so we could limit the fallout.\u201d  While Arena Investments were willing to front for the Kangaroos\u2019 remaining accommodation and travel expenses, they would not pay wages. The players were left with a difficult choice: play on and preserve their undefeated run for no pay, or return to their State League clubs. There was little recourse for the playing group, and with the players union still in its early days, there was nobody to lobby on their behalf. With an NSL licence on the horizon and big business onside, the players did not want to cause trouble. Except for McVittie, most played on, despite estimates that the squad would lose $80,000 in wages. \u201cThe players could easily have withdrawn from the venture and got paid by playing for their PSF clubs at the weekend,\u201d said coach Gary Marocchi after a 3-0 win over Singapore\u2019s Police Team in Singapore. \u201cBut they\u2019ve made the commitment for the long-term good of the game in WA.\u201d  In an effort to bring in greater revenue and generate interest for the lagging competition, the Kangaroos switched to night games. Previously, amateurs who played on Sundays found it difficult to attend the afternoon fixtures, robbing the team of a core group of supporters. Junior clinics with the players were also organised in order to connect the team with the local community. Meanwhile, the first head rolled over the Global Football Association pullout, with Mackay resigning as president of SAWA, acknowledging: \u201cI have to accept some accountability.\u201d \u201cIt was a bitter pill to swallow\u201d Mackay told Guardian Australia, who says his resignation was one of the conditions that Arena Investments had placed before SAWA in order to take over the licence. \u201cBut if my resignation would let SAWA off the hook and enable the Kangaroos to play out the season it was was the right thing for me to do.\u201d Tana believes that the slate simply needed to be wiped clean. Things began to look less bleak. Before resigning, Mackay was informed by the ASF that a Perth team would be allowed into the NSL as soon as possible. It was a \u201cconsolation\u201d for the man who had spent so much time lobbying for the cause. By June, the ASF confirmed that Perth would enter the competition in 1995, with Arena Investments tipped to take the Kangaroos into the NSL. For the ASF, there was more than just internal pressures to include Perth. In 1995, the ARL established the first ever Western Australian rugby league side, the Western Reds, while the Fremantle Dockers entered the AFL. The football marketplace had never been so crowded in Western Australia, and soccer needed its own foothold. In July, as attention increasingly turned towards entry into the NSL, the Kangaroos completed the formalities by taking out the Singapore Premier League title with a fortnight remaining in the competition. Turning in what Marocchi described as their \u201cworst performance at home\u201d, the Kangaroos still managed a 5-0 victory over Singapore Police at Dorrien Gardens. The financial reward was $70,000, although it was reported that Arena Investments still recorded a loss of $20,000. The players, of course, got nothing. As the final three matches were effectively dead rubbers, players returned to their State League duties. Captain Gareth Naven, Scott Miller and Dale Wingell were all recalled to Perth Italia, leaving Gary Marocchi frustrated once again. Italia refused to budge \u2013 \u201cwe have given more players to the Kangaroos than any other club\u201d said secretary Maria Ieleti \u2013 forcing Marocchi and assistant Micky Brennan to pull on the boots against Tiong Bahru. The team which began in turmoil with Perth Italia would end in much the same way. The Perth Kangaroos were, in many ways, reflective of the spirit of Australian football in the 1990s. If, as football historian Roy Hay wrote of the 1980s, \u201csoccer marked time while others moved ahead\u201d, in the 1990s the sport flailed about for a solution, and still the other codes moved ahead. A great many experiments were undertaken by Australian football in the 1990s in an effort to push the game beyond its traditional boundaries. Full of optimism and vision, in Perth, soccer again led the way among the football codes in establishing ties with Asia. \u201cIt caused a lot of interest\u201d, Mackay says, \u201cbecause they [ASF] had been eyeing Asia for a long long while. They saw it as a move away from Oceania. I think they were a bit upset that we had stolen the march, so to speak, by going in by ourselves.\u201d  Alas, football\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit and lofty goals have also been its great downfall. Vision and governance rarely operated in unison during the NSL, and lessons were rarely learnt in failure. The Perth Kangaroos, however, might be an exception. In October 1994, five months after coming to the rescue of the Kangaroos, Arena Investments were officially awarded a licence by the ASF, becoming the first privately owned club in the NSL. The Kangaroos were culled, and plans for a new team, Perth Glory, were finalised. \u201cConceptually, what the Kangaroos were all about was good,\u201d Tana says. \u201cIt was just targeted at the wrong league.\u201d  In the Glory were remnants of the Kangaroos. Entering the NSL in 1996, Roger Lefort was appointed general manager, while Gary Marocchi was named head coach. Ex-Kangaroos dominated the playing staff, with Vince Matassa, Paul McVittie, Paul Strudwick, Dale Wingell, Vladimir Beretovac and the Naven twins Craig and Gareth forming the core of the squad. According to Mackay, the Kangaroos experiment got the players to gel as a unit and accustomed to long flights. \u201cBecause we were flying up there every second weekend, we got used to the travel, so when Perth Glory came along most of the players didn\u2019t think anything of the traveling,\u201d says Mackay. Tana agrees: \u201cIn essence they had already done some of the work for us, what we didn\u2019t want to do was take any of the hierarchy with it.\u201d Current Perth Glory chief executive Jason Brewer says there will be an effort to recognise the 20th anniversary of the Perth Kangaroos players at their annual \u2018People\u2019s Game\u2019 celebrations on 5 April. \u201cWithout the Perth Kangaroos there would be no Perth Glory\u201d says Brewer. To this day, 20 years after Perth Kangaroos entered the Singapore Premier League, Mackay remains a foundation member of Perth Glory. \u201cI enjoyed the Glory matches as a spectator,\u201d he recalls of the club\u2019s first season. \u201cThey were a very good side, they had passion and the experience of the Kangaroos experiment. They knew how important it was to get a club into the National Soccer League.\u201d \u2022 With thanks to Richard Kreider and Chris Egan"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/27/mh370-search-scanner-underwater-search-debris", "sentences": ["&quot;This is a really rough piece of ocean, which is going to be a terrific issue,&quot; Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, told Associated Press."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-27T13:00:34Z", "title": "MH370: scanners reach search HQ as crews pin hope on new satellite images", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific", "Plane crashes", "Australia news", "China"], "article": "Underwater scanners that will be used to try to locate the black box flight recorders from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have arrived at the search headquarters in Australia, as crews pin their hopes on new satellite images showing 300 pieces of possible debris in the southern Indian Ocean. The new information came as strong winds and icy weather forced planes and ships to call off their search on Thursday of an area where officials believe the plane came down almost three weeks ago. Australian maritime officials said several planes had reached the search zone, located about 1,550 miles (2,500 km) south-west of Perth, but had returned early without finding any of the floating debris. Sam Cardwell, a spokesman for the Australian maritime safety authority, said the planes had stayed in the area for about two hours. &quot;They got a bit of time in, but it was not useful because there was no visibility,&quot; he said. The bad weather is expected to last well into Friday, raising the possibility that the hunt for hundreds of pieces of debris that could be from MH370 will not resume until the weekend. The arrival of sensitive tracking equipment offers a glimmer of hope for a breakthrough in what has become the biggest mystery in commercial aviation history. An Australian naval vessel ship will sweep the seabed by towing an underwater listening device deep below the surface in the hope of picking up an ultrasonic signal from one or both of the plane&apos;s black box recorders, while a small submersible drone will be used to scan the sea floor for signs of wreckage.      Thursday&apos;s search involved 11 planes and five ships in an area of the vast southern Indian Ocean where officials believe the plane ran out of fuel and crashed, killing all 239 people aboard. They were trying to locate 122 objects captured in French satellite images on 23 March that senior Malaysian officials described as the most credible lead yet as to the jetliner&apos;s whereabouts. Later on Thursday, Thailand said it had satellite images showing 300 floating objects floating in roughly the same area. The objects, ranging in length from two to 15 metres, were found about 125 miles from the site where the French satellite had earlier spotted more than 100 pieces of debris. Anond Snidvongs, executive director of Thailand&apos;s space technology development agency, said the information had been passed on to Malaysia. &quot;But we cannot \u2013 dare not \u2013 confirm they are debris from the plane,&quot; he told AFP. Officials from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Thursday&apos;s search had been split into two areas totalling 78,000 sq km (30,000 square miles). The operation involves planes and ships from the US, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Locating and retrieving at least some of the floating objects could prove crucial in the absence of any physical evidence supporting the theory that MH370 ran out of fuel hours after it turned sharply off course and disappeared from air traffic controllers&apos; screens over the South China Sea en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Search teams are hoping that the detection equipment will be able to pick up acoustic pings emitted every second from the plane&apos;s black box flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. Each of the two recorders has a beacon, attached to the outside of the black box, which once activated by contact with water makes a sound every second. But it is a race against time: the beacons have a battery life of 30 days, after which the pings begin to fade. Chuck Schofield of Dukane Seacom, a company that has sold the pingers to Malaysia Airlines, told Associated Press that the batteries might last an additional five days before dying. Assuming that the plane crashed on 8 March, as Malaysian officials insist, that means the beacons aboard MH370 will begin to fade around 7 April and could go silent around 12 April. The US navy tracking equipment \u2013 a special listening device known as a &quot;towed pinger locator&quot; and an underwater drone dubbed Bluefin-21 \u2013 has arrived in Perth, where the international effort is based and is being sent to the search site. Reports said the equipment would be loaded on to the Australian navy&apos;s HMAS Ocean Shield, which will drag the locator through the water in the hope of picking up a signal. The drone can dive to depths of about 4,500 metres, using sonar to form images of the ocean floor. Similar technology was used to locate the main wreckage from Air France flight 447 in 2011 \u2013 yet it still took searchers two years to recover the black box from the depths of the Atlantic. The operation has been hampered by bad weather and conditions, prolonging the anguish of relatives after Malaysian officials said they had concluded that the aircraft had crashed into the sea with the loss of all on board. Experts said search crews faced significant dangers due to frequent bad weather and the area&apos;s distance from land. &quot;This is a really rough piece of ocean, which is going to be a terrific issue,&quot; Kerry Sieh, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore, told Associated Press. &quot;I worry that people carrying out the rescue mission are going to get into trouble.&quot; Criticism of the Malaysian authorities&apos; handling of the incident has continued, with relatives of the 154 Chinese passengers on board MH370 ridiculing Malaysian government and airline officials at a meeting in Beijing on Wednesday. On Thursday, Malaysia Airlines ran a full-page message of condolence in the New Straits Times. &quot;Our sincerest condolences go out to the loved ones of the 239 passengers, friends and colleagues. Words alone cannot express our enormous sorrow and pain,&quot; it said. Chinese insurance companies have started paying compensation to the families of passengers, according to Xinhua. Several Chinese celebrities took to social media to voice anger at the Malaysian government. In a widely shared post on Sina Weibo, China&apos;s version of Twitter, the singer and actor Chen Kun said he would boycott Malaysian goods, while the Hong Kong-born actor Deric Wan called for evidence that the plane had crashed. &quot;What Chinese people wanted was the truth of the missing plane instead of a pointless press conference,&quot; he said on Weibo, according to China Daily. But in an opinion piece in Thursday&apos;s Global Times, Wang Wenwen said that while Malaysia had handled the crash aftermath ineptly, raw emotion should not be allowed to determine relations between the Chinese and Malaysian governments. &quot;It is too early to let public opinion lead the way at the current stage. Whether Beijing-Kuala Lumpur relations will dim depends to some extent on how the [Chinese] government will act between diplomatic manoeuvering and public opinion.&quot; The New Zealand family of Paul Weeks, one of the passengers, added their voice to criticism of the Malaysian authorities. &quot;The whole situation has been handled appallingly, incredibly insensitively,&quot; Sara Weeks, the missing man&apos;s sister, told Radio Live in New Zealand. &quot;Everyone is angry about it. &quot;The Malaysian government, the airline \u2013 it&apos;s just all been incredibly poor. Who&apos;s to say they couldn&apos;t have located the plane the day that it happened?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/27/sanctions-london-russian-oligarchs-roman-abramovich", "sentences": ["Some Russians are trying to get money out [of Europe] and into Singapore, which is the new Cyprus [formerly the banking centre favoured by wealthy Russians]."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-27T16:55:02Z", "title": "What will sanctions mean for London's Russian oligarchs?", "tags": ["Russia", "International trade", "London", "Economics", "Roman Abramovich", "Global economy", "Business", "Europe", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "When David Cameron went on his first official visit to Moscow in September 2011, he made sure to take two dozen business leaders in a bid to drum up some trade for UK plc. &quot;Russia is resource-rich and services-light whereas Britain is the opposite,&quot; the prime minister said in a speech extolling the virtues of global trade. Two and a half years on, his talk of sharing out the trade cake with Russia is a distant memory as Russian troops raise their flag over Crimean military bases and western leaders debate further sanctions against Vladimir Putin&apos;s government. UK-Russian trade programmes &quot;are either going to be completely cancelled or scaled down&quot;, said Eugene Nivorozhkin, a lecturer at UCL&apos;s School of Slavonic and East European Studies. &quot;A lot of sanctions are going to take place by default,&quot; he said. &quot;Projects that were profitable a month ago are no longer profitable.&quot; On Tuesday the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was reviewing a deal on nuclear co-operation with Rosatom, which would have opened UK doors for the Russian state nuclear firm. Meanwhile, a visit to Russia by Cameron&apos;s envoy to the country, the Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, has been cancelled. With the climate cooling by the day, what are the prospects for London&apos;s oligarchs? Some politicians have been openly speculating as to whether the sanctions shortlist could be further extended to take in some of London&apos;s best-known Russians, in particular the Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich. &quot;At some stage, if the oligarchs aren&apos;t careful, they could end up with their assets here being frozen,&quot; said one City of London financier, who deals with wealthy Russian clients. &quot;It is already stopping new money coming in and stopping the money here from being used. Some Russians are trying to get money out [of Europe] and into Singapore, which is the new Cyprus [formerly the banking centre favoured by wealthy Russians]. I don&apos;t think Putin is taking the threat of sanctions seriously, but the oligarchs are, particularly those close to Putin. There are some who are here because they are not close to Putin.&quot; However, despite the visibility of some Russians in the capital, Cameron&apos;s 2011 sales patter did not turn Russia into a major destination for British exporters: German machine tools and French military aircraft are worth far more to Russia than British goods. In 2012 the UK sold $8bn of goods to Russia, but that compares with $14bn sold by France and is dwarfed by the $38bn from Germany. Perhaps surprisingly, Russia is not even a big customer for the City of London&apos;s banks and law firms. The UK sold \u00a31.2bn of banking advice and insurance to Russia in 2012: a big number, but only 1% of UK financial service exports, according to analysis by the Open Europe thinktank. This figure includes the handsome fees paid to lawyers and bankers that help Russian companies float on the London stock exchange: 53 Russian companies have a listing on the main stockmarket here, including the state energy giant Gazprom and Russia&apos;s largest bank Sberbank. A further 15 Russian companies are listed on the smaller Alternative Investment Market. But Russian company listings peaked before the financial crisis. Data from Dealogic shows that 11 Russian companies gained a prestigious London listing in 2007; last year that had dwindled to just one \u2013 the bank and credit card company TCS, which raised $1bn when it floated in October. If the financial spigots of the City of London were turned off, it would be Russia that has the most to lose: since 2002 Russian companies have raised $406bn on London&apos;s capital markets. While these loans and bonds generate healthy interest rates for the international banks headquartered in London, few think the City would struggle without them. Raoul Ruparel, head of economic research at Open Europe, said: &quot;While here are certain firms and sectors linked closely to Russia, I think in the broad sense the pinch wouldn&apos;t be huge and the City would be able to adjust and find business elsewhere.&quot; The furore over a line in an official document about the UK&apos;s intention to keep the City open to Russia overstates Russia&apos;s importance, he said. The UK has provided one of the &quot;most hawkish&quot; voices on sanctions in Europe. &quot;Whether some lawyers and business advisers are not generating fees is not going to be high up on Europe&apos;s agenda on the sanctions. It will be more &apos;where is Finland going to get 100% of its energy from?&apos;&quot; The impact on London&apos;s overheated property market is also likely to be muted. Russians account for 2% of the prime London luxury market, according to the upmarket estate agents Savills. While political turmoil could make London&apos;s townhouses an even more attractive safe haven for wealthy Russians and Ukrainians, a spokesperson said: &quot;We&apos;ve seen no real change and nor do we expect any.&quot; Another City financier, who has been involved in deals conducted by some of London&apos;s most high-profile Russian oligarchs, said: &quot;I don&apos;t think there was lots of Russian money deposited here. Russians will not necessarily use London banks when Switzerland is good for that. Russian family offices [that manage private Russian wealth from London] will be moving money out, but that would have been done immediately. Property, which a lot of Russians do have in London, is less liquid. &quot;I don&apos;t think they [rich Russians in London] are particularly freaking out, as they had already put money where it couldn&apos;t be got at. Anyway, their view is that the UK, Germany and France will not do anything on sanctions that will be particularly nasty.

No.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/28/australia-politicians-pay", "sentences": ["While discussing whether Arthur Sinodinos may have done something wrong during his time as a director of Australian Water Holdings, McGuire stated: \u201ca lot of these things head back to one place, and that is the fact that we don\u2019t pay our politicians enough.\u201d When Tony Jones pointed out that Sinodinos was not yet a senator at that time, McGuire continued: \u201cHe was probably doing so because he knew he was going to become a politician and get paid no money during the biggest period of time in his life where he\u2019d make money.\u201d  Rupert Murdoch has previously taken a similar line, praising Singapore\u2019s ministerial pay scheme.", "Murdoch reckons that &quot;the most open and clear society in the world is Singapore \u2013 the cleanest society you can find anywhere \u2013 as every minister is paid at least $1m a year and has no temptation to transgress.&quot; The Singaporean prime minister takes home almost AUD$2m a year \u2013 nearly four times as much as Tony Abbott.", "If we look at parliamentarians\u2019 pay among those countries considered less corrupt, including the Scandinavians, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, only Swiss Federal Councillors earn more.", "Although members of the executive in Singapore are paid extremely well, parliamentarians are paid about the same as their Australian counterparts."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-27T23:33:45Z", "title": "Are Australia's politicians underpaid? | David Donaldson", "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics"], "article": "Australian parliamentarians\u2019 pay is generous by international standards.

And then there are a few who take the \u2013 perhaps unpopular \u2013 view that our elected representatives should be paid more.  There are two main arguments for increasing parliamentarians\u2019 pay: that higher pay will make MPs less tempted to make money in shady ways, and that it will attract higher calibre candidates. The first one was argued by Eddie McGuire on Q&amp;A earlier this week. While discussing whether Arthur Sinodinos may have done something wrong during his time as a director of Australian Water Holdings, McGuire stated: \u201ca lot of these things head back to one place, and that is the fact that we don\u2019t pay our politicians enough.\u201d When Tony Jones pointed out that Sinodinos was not yet a senator at that time, McGuire continued: \u201cHe was probably doing so because he knew he was going to become a politician and get paid no money during the biggest period of time in his life where he\u2019d make money.\u201d  Rupert Murdoch has previously taken a similar line, praising Singapore\u2019s ministerial pay scheme. Murdoch reckons that &quot;the most open and clear society in the world is Singapore \u2013 the cleanest society you can find anywhere \u2013 as every minister is paid at least $1m a year and has no temptation to transgress.&quot; The Singaporean prime minister takes home almost AUD$2m a year \u2013 nearly four times as much as Tony Abbott. Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t much evidence to suggest that paying our MPs more would make politics cleaner. Research is indecisive on this point, but seems to suggest that paying public officials more once they\u2019re already making a decent, living wage doesn\u2019t have much of an effect on corruption. Such studies usually point to the importance of transparency in government practice and strong anti-corruption institutions as the primary factors in reducing sleaze. Indeed, Australia already has very low levels of corruption, according to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index, ranking ninth in TI\u2019s 2013 report. If we look at parliamentarians\u2019 pay among those countries considered less corrupt, including the Scandinavians, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, only Swiss Federal Councillors earn more. Although members of the executive in Singapore are paid extremely well, parliamentarians are paid about the same as their Australian counterparts. Though salaries vary among this group, these results suggest that the strongest predictor of clean politics among stable, developed countries is a mix of strong anti-corruption institutions and high levels of transparency. As for higher pay attracting better candidates, an extensive report released last year in Britain \u2013 a country where parliamentarians earn around $120,000 a year \u2013 by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority stated:  Nor have we been persuaded by the claim [\u2026] that the quality of those offering themselves as prospective candidates has been adversely affected by the level of pay available. We have found no evidence to support this claim and, indeed, there is plenty of reason to suspect that the selection policies and procedures of the political parties are far more important determinants of the quality and character of prospective candidates.  Most countries that pay their MPs better (relative to the size of their economy) are less well run than Australia. And although Australian parliamentary pay is already quite high, there are plenty of examples of ineffective members of parliament who would not have been elected if not for the two-party system and patronage practices on both sides of parliament.  Although parliamentarians deserve to be properly remunerated for the work they do, which is difficult and important, there is no evidence that paying them more will result in cleaner or more effective politics. Institutional factors are far more important \u2013 reforming the way political parties and government work will have a much greater effect than higher pay. It is the ability of Australian institutions and the Australian people to hold politicians to account that will ensure low levels of corruption and effective members of parliament. What we need is more democracy in public life, not more money."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/28/battersea-power-station-bedsit-sale", "sentences": ["Yet they admit they will not restrict purchasers, leaving the door open for agents for Hong Kong or Singapore &quot;buy-to-leave&quot; investors to fly in with bids."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-28T00:01:02Z", "title": "Battersea power station bedsit goes on sale for almost \u00a31m", "tags": ["Property", "House prices", "London", "Money", "UK news"], "article": "For sale: Battersea bedsit.

This seems good news for anyone concerned about the environment. A finite planet obviously cannot sustain limitless population growth, and many environmentalists make the case that even the current population, 7.2 billion, exceeds the planet&apos;s ecological carrying capacity. If birth rates continue to fall, we might realise the UN&apos;s &quot;low&quot; projection of a population peak of around 8.3 billion mid-century, declining back to today&apos;s population by 2100. For economists, however, and for the public officials they inform, the aging and decline of the population presents not a boon but a threat. When the fertility rate falls below replacement level, the older generation outnumbers the newer. That means fewer workers supporting more retirees, falling income-tax revenues and reduced economic growth. Accordingly, many countries including Singapore, France, Austria, Chile and South Korea, are offering people financial incentives to have children. So here, as in many other arenas, we seem to face a contradiction between economic and ecological health. But a closer look at population and economic growth reveals there is more to the story, with problems extending right to the basic structure of our financial system. To see how, let&apos;s ask a naive question: already in many countries with slowing population growth, youth unemployment is at record levels. Why then do we think we need to add even more youth to the workforce? Why can&apos;t we allow economic demand to shift from young to old, rather than increasing overall production and consumption by adding more people? The short answer is that our financial system requires growth in order to function. In a system in which money is created as interest-bearing debt, the absence of growth means fewer lending opportunities. Without new money entering the economy, existing debts are harder to repay. Bankruptcies increase, wealth concentrates in fewer hands, and pressure grows to financialise assets, liquidate natural wealth, cut social services and essentially direct all resources toward the servicing of debt. While this is going on, technological improvements in productivity lead to lower employment, which, coupled with rising indebtedness, cut demand and reduce lending opportunities even more. In other words, the growth imperative comes not because human needs are greater than in the past, but because the financial system requires growth. Economic growth is much easier to achieve when the population is growing as well. In its absence, consumption per capita must grow instead. Indeed, certain countries uphold economic growth as a way to deal with the problem of aging population. This should sober up our celebration of the drop in fertility rates, if they accompany resource-intensive development. And apparently they do: the world over, fertility rates are inversely correlated with industrialisation. If everyone on Earth lived the lifestyle of a traditional Indian villager, it is arguable that even 12 billion would be a sustainable world population. If everyone lives like an upper-middle-class North American (a status to which much of the world seems to aspire), then even two billion is unsustainable. Population decline is welcome news, but it needs to be considered in a larger context. Population stability or decline is not an environmental panacea if it is accompanied by continued growth in consumption. This means that overpopulation is a red herring. Of course, at some point, preferably soon, population growth must end, but overpopulation is a diversion from more fundamental issues. Lurking behind the spectre of population growth lies a more challenging problem: economic growth.  Population control doesn&apos;t rock the boat very much; it doesn&apos;t fundamentally alter the distribution of wealth and power today. Indeed, it plays into a colonialistic narrative that the fecund masses of the global south are to blame for the environmental crisis, and suggests that the solution is more development (with its population-limiting effects). In comparison, it is far more disruptive to the present world order to challenge economic growth, globalisation, and development. We must examine all aspects, economic and ideological, of our growth-dependent system, starting with the rhetoric of development that upholds an industrial, US/European-style society as the pinnacle of human wellbeing, and extending to the monetary system that drives globalisation and the growth of consumption. Whether in terms of population or consumption, sustainability cannot mean sustainable growth. Join the community of sustainability professionals and experts.

He had been on the night shift, then slept for five or six hours, so it was getting on for midday. He showered, dressed, then, after lunch in the canteen, packed his bags and took them up to heli admin to be weighed. Sharp has been a scaffolder on the rigs for nearly 23 years, working two-week blocks of 12-hour shifts, often in brutal weather: horizontal snow, screaming wind, icicles as tall as\u00a0a room and waves that lapped at 75ft-high platforms. He commutes from East\u00a0Hull, where he was born and now lives with his wife and daughter in a neat, low house facing a church and a main road. The flight was running late, so Sharp went back downstairs to watch TV. When the call finally came, he returned to heli admin, a small room for a large and diverse bunch: the crew, plus 18 passengers, 17 men and one woman, working as safety officers, electricians, caterers, welders; old hands like Sharp, and those for whom the whole thing was still new, such as James Nugent, who had also just come off a night shift and was on only his second trip offshore. Nugent is a\u00a0tall, well-built South African, weathered and emotionally open. After a\u00a0career in the film industry and running a B&amp;B, he\u00a0became a rope access instructor, specialising in work at heights or in confined spaces. We talk in a\u00a0restaurant perched on a point of land just outside Newquay in Cornwall, where he lives. Everyone climbed into neoprene immersion suits. The five days of mandatory safety training for anyone who goes offshore are conducted in a\u00a0swimming pool kept\u00a0at 26C; the North Sea is about 17C in the summer, 6 or 7C in the winter. Survival times at the latter temperature are one to three hours, hence the suits, which fasten with a\u00a0heavy-duty zip and include feet, spray hood, strobe light, beacons and a\u00a0rebreather, designed to buy precious minutes in a submersion. There is something comforting about the suit, but it also produces a distinctly unpleasant feeling of entrapment: rubber cuffs, designed to stop any water from entering the suit, fit tightly around your wrists and, harder to get used to, your neck. When the safety video began and the passengers saw that they would be in a\u00a0Super Puma L2, more than one heart sank. Everybody in the room knew that since 2009 there had been four serious incidents involving Super Pumas in British waters: three ditchings and one crash \u2013 or, to be specific, as helicopter pilots would dearly like people to be, two controlled ditchings, one controlled flight into terrain and one crash, in April 2009, in which an AS 332-L2 fell out of clear skies off Crimond, between Fraserburgh and Peterhead, killing all 16\u00a0people on board. The last ditching, in 2012, led to all Super Puma EC225s being withdrawn from service over the North Sea. In fact, they had been cleared to fly again only the previous month; not all were yet back in service.     The victims: Sarah Darnley and Duncan Munro. Photograph: AFP/Police Scotland    Nugent looked around the small room. There was George Allison, safety supervisor, &quot;pretty much the first guy I met&quot;. Allison had shoved a\u00a0newsletter into his hand and said, &quot;&apos;I can&apos;t believe this is happening.&apos; And I said, &apos;I\u00a0don&apos;t know what you&apos;re talking about.&apos; And he said, &apos;Read that.&apos;&quot; It was an account of a briefing on the Borgsten Dolphin a few days previously, on 8\u00a0August, in which Will Hanekom, deputy chief pilot of helicopter service company CHC, and managers from rig operators Total tried to prepare nervous workers for the return of the grounded EC225s. One worker had asked what would happen if any of them refused to board. &quot;If you can&apos;t live with the risk, then you can&apos;t work offshore,&quot; came the blunt reply. &quot;How else are we going to get there?&quot; added a CHC pilot. &quot;It is what we do. At some point we have to put our big boy pants on.&quot; &quot;It was absolutely disgusting,&quot; says Sharp, who got to the platform two days later. &quot;A lot of people felt kicked in the teeth.&quot; Nugent had come to know Allison relatively well in the two weeks he had been on the Borgsten. &quot;Every night I told him what we were going to do [on that shift]. He signed my risk assessment.&quot; Though Allison was big and burly, Nugent found he had a\u00a0soft side and a sense of fun. &quot;[At quiet times] we sat in the locker room next to George&apos;s office and he&apos;d play music, 60s and 70s psychedelic rock. There was a lot of banter. He&apos;d put together a newsletter and five or six questions \u2013 general knowledge, like Trivial Pursuit. We&apos;d try to work them out and he would have a look and laugh.&quot;     The victims: George Allison and Gary McCrossan. Photograph: Press shots    Then there was Sarah Darnley, the only woman on the flight (just 3% of the British offshore workforce is female). Nugent knew her quite well, too: they had started their shifts on the same day and quickly discovered they had a country in common. She was from Elgin, but had travelled in South Africa and liked to talk to him about it. She was in catering and dealt with laundry, and he met her when he brought in his bag. Or she&apos;d bring him coffee and biscuits, and they would chat. Nugent caught Allison&apos;s eye. &quot;I looked at George and he shook his head, and just went, &apos;I&apos;m going home.&apos; And I thought, he&apos;s 25 years down the line. If he&apos;s flying helicopters, I&apos;m going home as well.&quot; Finally they heard the Super Puma coming into\u00a0land. Suddenly heli admin was even more\u00a0full of people, hustle and bustle, as passengers from Aberdeen, or from the nearby North Alwyn platform, disembarked. There was a\u00a0great swapping of life jackets, and then they\u00a0were walking out on to the helideck and into\u00a0a\u00a0sunny August afternoon. Business in the North Sea is booming. Although production is dropping steadily, it still provides 67% of the UK&apos;s oil and 53% of its gas, according to a\u00a0report published by the Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change last month. There are vast new ventures \u2013 in the West Shetlands, for instance, where BP is spending \u00a34.5bn extending the Clair field \u2013 but the character of the main basin is also changing fast. Ageing rigs such as the Borgsten \u2013 a\u00a0semi-submersible, built in 1975 and registered (because it is movable and thus counts as a ship) in Singapore \u2013 require expensive maintenance or complex programmes of skilled decommissioning. As the huge multinationals remove themselves from fields they have largely mined out, smaller companies are sprucing up worn-out installations and using them to extract every last drop \u2013 or pioneering new technologies to chase oil previously impossible to reach. Estimates of what is left in the North Sea vary between 12bn and \u2013 if you are Alex Salmond, desperate to persuade Scottish voters to choose oil-subsidised independence \u2013 24bn barrels of oil equivalent. Ten years ago, there were 78 companies operating here; now there are 131. The British oil industry employs 440,000 people; in 2012, 25,760 of them spent more than 100 nights offshore. And they all have to get to work by helicopter, flying over one of the most hostile terrains in the world. The four variants of Super Pumas, along with Sikorsky S61s and S92s, are the &quot;heavies&quot; of the helicopter world: big and sturdy, they are used for search-and-rescue missions and in the army, as well as at oil industry locations all over the world. The pilots I speak to affirm their faith in them, especially the EC225s \u2013 the latest generation of Super Pumas. &quot;It&apos;s like driving a\u00a0Porsche after getting into an old Mini,&quot; says Mike Buckley, a spokesman for the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa). Buckley started flying helicopters in the army before putting in more than 26 years, and counting, over the North Sea. Oil &amp; Gas UK describes the EC225 as &quot;arguably the most examined helicopter in modern history&quot;. &quot;Logically I know they&apos;re a pretty safe monster,&quot; says oil worker Jonathan Garcia, who was in a CHC-operated Super Puma EC225 when it executed a\u00a0controlled landing between Shetland and Orkney in October 2012. &quot;Illogically, I hate anything to do with Eurocopter [now Airbus Helicopters] \u2013 95% of the time I&apos;m convinced I&apos;m going to die.&quot; The helicopter Garcia was in dropped 3,000ft in less than a minute, but &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t think the pilots would have put a ripple in bed linen,&quot; he says, speaking on the phone from Middlesbrough, with his lawyer listening in. He was impressed by their sang-froid. &quot;The water came up to our ankles, our knees, our waists. One of the pilots pops off the starboard door and comes round to have a chat. &apos;Anybody got any questions?&apos; As if he was on a\u00a0Sunday walk with his dog, not bobbing around in the North Atlantic. One of the guys put his hand up. &apos;Any chance we can get out?&apos;&quot; Landing\u00a0on water is not the crisis it&apos;s been made out to be, argues CHC pilot Will Hanekom. &quot;For us, landing on the water is a safe solution.&quot; Sitting in the cockpit of an EC225 in CHC&apos;s hangar, I begin to see why their pilots wax so lyrical about them: pilot and copilot sit, essentially, in a\u00a0bowl of glass \u2013 glass over them, glass to the side, glass below. Flying, it must feel (bar the extreme noise) as though they are sitting in the sky. &quot;I still get a buzz when I\u00a0get into the cockpit,&quot; Buckley says. &quot;The smell of the aviation fuel when you fire up the engines. The feeling when you take off into low cloud, then push through and hit clear air, or watch the sun rise, the oilfields laid out below \u2013 it&apos;s a majestic sight.&quot; Rig scaffolder Paul Sharp is unmoved: &quot;They&apos;re just taxis to us, really. A flying taxi.&quot; The passengers do have a rather different point of view. The Super Pumas are cramped. It isn&apos;t possible to stand upright, and the seats are strikingly narrow. They are also configured so that passengers face each other; it is not uncommon for their legs to be interlocked. When these L-variants first went into service, Buckley notes, &quot;people got on, lit a\u00a0cigarette, leaned back and read a paper&quot;. There were no bulky survival suits or mandatory life\u00a0jackets, which alone add 3.17kg to a person&apos;s weight. And people are bigger now. It thus becomes rather important where, exactly, you sit. &quot;I was quite fortunate,&quot; says Sam Bull, 24, a field analyst based in London. He was coming from the North Alwyn and, along with three others, was already on the chopper when the passengers from the Borgsten Dolphin started filing on. &quot;If\u00a0it&apos;s your first time offshore or on to a platform, you get a green armband and they don&apos;t let you sit next to the emergency exits. But they forgot to give me a\u00a0green armband, so I sat right by it.&quot; Nugent was last on. He turned right, shuffling all the way to the back: &quot;Then one of the baggage handlers said, &apos;No, don&apos;t sit there.&apos;&quot; He worked his way back to the middle and took a seat on the aisle, next to Allison. &quot;And the large chap that George was, I had only half an arse cheek on the seat. I remember thinking, &apos;Well, this is going to be an uncomfortable two hours.&apos;&quot; He did his belt up extra tight, so it was holding him in the chair. The doors slammed shut and everyone reached for their ear defenders. The pilots announced a\u00a015-minute refuelling stop at Sumburgh airport on Shetland. &quot;Ideal,&quot; Sharp thought. &quot;Enough time to stretch my legs and have a quick cup of tea.&quot; The rotors roared and finally the Super Puma lifted itself up. It dipped slightly at the front, as though bowing at the waist to those left behind, then rose up and out, over the sea. Nugent watched the orange bulk of the Borgsten receding below them, then sat back and looked around. Up on the right-hand side of the interior, he noticed a screw loose and a panel beginning to come away. He took off his ear defenders, just to check what he already sensed. It was really very loud, much louder than any previous choppers he&apos;d been on. He ran his eye over the windows, &quot;because you just do. You go, &apos;There&apos;s my exit. If that exit&apos;s blocked, where do I go? OK, I&apos;ve got George next to me, so I&apos;ve got to fight for my second exit.&apos;&quot; He noticed there was a tab on the window. &quot;I never had that in my survival training.&quot; He tried to doze off, but couldn&apos;t, so he scanned the cabin, noticed someone reading Nuts and indicated \u2013 nobody could hear anyone else talk \u2013 that he wanted a look. As he began to flick through the pages, he was overtaken by tiredness. Soon he was asleep. Sharp and Bull fell asleep, too.     RNLI crew members attend the crash. Photograph: EPA/RNLI    When Nugent woke, the sun had gone and they were flying through cloud. He tried to figure out where they were, but wasn&apos;t sure until the pilot announced they were 10 minutes from Sumburgh and to prepare for landing. This woke Sharp. He sat up and tightened his belt. Bull woke, too. &quot;It looked as though we were at 30,000ft rather than 2,500.&quot; Nugent shut his eyes, wanting to sleep for that extra 10 minutes; 10 stretched to 15, to 20, but they were still above cloud level. Nugent woke again. &quot;Jesus,&quot; he thought, &quot;I must have had more than 10 minutes.&quot; They all looked at each other. And then Sharp heard &quot;a whoosh, and a crack like someone cracking a bone. And the chopper turned on its side, in the air.&quot; Nugent heard the bang, too: &quot;An almighty bang, metal on metal, above our heads. It was loud. And I was just, &apos;What the\u2026?&apos; And then there was this twisting of the fuselage, left to right, very rapid, very violent, very sudden, and I thought, oh no, there&apos;s something wrong. I looked at the others and there was shock and horror on their faces. I thought, no, we can&apos;t be crashing. You don&apos;t want to believe it.&quot; Bull says he didn&apos;t hear anything break, but he felt a &quot;shudder and banking from side to side. A\u00a0shudder in the airframe itself, and the engine straining. It happened so quickly \u2013 it seemed as if [the helicopter] was working, but just falling. There was no lift. I&apos;d be lying if I said I wasn&apos;t scared, but also I didn&apos;t believe it. It was incredibly surreal.&quot; Nugent has no idea why, but he started to count: one one thousand, two one thousand. &quot;And when I got to four, I could see this gap of mist or cloud and there was the ocean, and I remember thinking, we&apos;re so close to the ocean \u2013 why are we so close to the ocean?&quot; The light was dim below the clouds, Bull remembers, and it was hard to see faces. &quot;It\u00a0was quite misty,&quot; Sharp says. &quot;The swell was breaking white, and there were white horses.&quot; They hit the water. The rotor blades shattered, Bull says, and the windows at the back popped out. He remembers water streaming through them like fountains. It was, according to the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), 18.17 local time. &quot;The helicopter filled with water, instantly,&quot; Sharp says, then it inverted. &quot;The door buckled on the left-hand side and none of us had a chance to pull our rebreathers out, get our hoods on, nothing like that. And as the water came up to here&quot; \u2013 he indicates his chin \u2013 &quot;and I took my last breath, I could see people floating around. As soon as my head was covered with water, I\u00a0looked down and pulled the tab on the window and it just came to bits in my hand. So I hit it with my elbow a couple of times. Nothing.&quot; His entire body relives the motions as he describes them. &quot;And then I\u00a0punched it \u2013 I\u00a0think I punched it three times \u2013 and all of a\u00a0sudden it went pop and away it went.&quot; Nugent grabbed desperately for his rebreather, but he was clawing at the wrong side. &quot;I remember the water washing over my face and I told myself, &apos;Take your last breath&apos; and then the impact of the chopper I think knocked me out. There&apos;s a\u00a0definite gap there. All that came over me was, don&apos;t worry, you&apos;re going to see Indi [his two-year-old] again. And I thought, well, OK, if I&apos;m going to see Indi again, do your worst. And I kind of relaxed into it \u2013 but I was aware we were turning upside down and I was hung in my harness. Then, maybe 45\u00a0seconds, a minute, later, I heard that same voice again: &apos;James, it&apos;s time to get out now.&apos; And I was like, oh, OK. I don&apos;t remember undoing my buckle, but I\u00a0felt myself floating and I reached over, grabbed the window and pulled myself through it.&quot; &quot;As I hit the surface, the first thing I did was push myself away from the aircraft,&quot; Sharp says. &quot;Then I went for the tab on my jacket and pulled it, and nothing happened. I tore the Velcro away, grabbed hold of the straw, started blowing it up and it went bouff! by itself, which was a bit of a\u00a0shock.&quot; Then he looked around: &quot;I saw this guy beside me. I grabbed him to get him away from the chopper. His eyes were massive, his pupils were black and he had sick coming out of his mouth \u2013 I just knew he was dead.&quot; He heard someone shouting, &quot;Me back! Me back! I think I broke me back!&quot; Sharp grabbed hold of him: &quot;You&apos;re alive,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&apos;s get away!&quot; They were surrounded by aviation fuel, and Sharp kept being sick. His movement was also oddly constricted \u2013 a piece of rotor blade had torn a hole in his suit. When he pushed the blade away, his suit began to fill with freezing water. When Nugent broke the surface, he saw land not far away. His first thought was, that&apos;s fine! And then, close upon it, 30 seconds more and we&apos;d have hit it. And he began to shiver in earnest. He climbed up on to the fuselage and looked around him. There was gear everywhere, rope, pieces of helicopter, &quot;guys in the water, and I\u00a0was screaming at them, &apos;Raft up! Raft up!&apos; There were other guys holding on to the fuselage and I\u00a0was saying, &apos;Climb on to the fuselage!&apos;&quot; \u2013 where Bull joined him \u2013 but then he realised that wasn&apos;t a\u00a0good idea at all, because the aluminium underside of the helicopter had ripped jaggedly open. So he yelled, &quot;Stay in the water! Hold on!&quot; They tried to deploy the life raft, but only about 10% of it emerged and &quot;we had to fight and push and tug it out of its casing. Obviously it&apos;s not been designed to be deployed when the chopper&apos;s upside down. I\u00a0looked at Gary [McCrossan], who was as white\u00a0as a sheet \u2013 that white-grey colour \u2013 and I\u00a0recognised he was going into a\u00a0heart attack. I\u00a0pulled him into the life raft. Then I\u00a0grabbed one of the younger chaps and said, &apos;Listen, sort him out.&apos;&quot; He helped five or six more men climb in. When he finally looked up, Nugent saw there were still people in the water, drifting away, so he made for the second lifeboat, where he found the copilot. &quot;But [the lifeboat] is just a big inner tube, there&apos;s no way you can steer it. And I\u00a0was like, &apos;This is useless. What do we do now? Did you mayday?&apos;&quot; The copilot said no, there was no chance; but they were so close to landing, they would have fallen off the radar and triggered a\u00a0rescue. It was a long half-hour before they heard the familiar thud-thud-thud of rotor blades and another Super Puma appeared. It lowered a winch man and secured McCrossan first. But as it began to lift him into the air, one end of a\u00a0cord from the life raft caught in the winch and the other end round the foot of a man in the raft, throwing him out. Quickly he was dragged back in, but the raft was now attached, precariously, to the helicopter. Bull scrambled to cut them free. &quot;I doubt I was the only survivor to fear another Super Puma falling from the sky that day,&quot; he wrote later. &quot;Finally, one by one, all the survivors were winched to safety. Meanwhile, at 18.33, Jim Nicholson, a retired English teacher\u00a0who has volunteered with the RNLI at Aith on Shetland since 1970, got a call from the coastguard. He alerted his crew; by 18.40 they had launched. They began by searching north-west of the crash site but, finding nothing, returned to the wreck, now drifting towards the rocks. Eventually the fuselage broke open and two bodies emerged. It was after 8pm and getting dark. The crew knew there should be one more body in the helicopter, so they drew it out into the bay and held it there all night, rocking quietly, until another lifeboat relieved them in the morning. Sarah Darnley&apos;s body was retrieved by divers the next day. When it comes to such disasters, veteran North Sea pilots start making analogies to Swiss cheese. There are so many checks and balances keeping the helicopters flying that normally they &quot;catch things going through&quot;, Buckley says. &quot;Obviously in the last five years there have been a series of holes lining up, and we need to know why.&quot; Jim McAuslan, general secretary of Balpa, is even blunter: &quot;We believe something is wrong in the North Sea.&quot; The question is, what?     \u2018The helicopter filled with water, instantly\u2019: survivors (from left) Paul Sharp, Sam Bull and James Nugent. Photograph: Gary Calton; Martin Godwin; Phil Bunt/cornwall-photos.com, all for the Guardian    The passengers I spoke to have doubts about whether pilot error was involved, but mechanical failure was ruled out quite early, and the Helicopter Safety Steering Group cleared the Super Pumas for flight after just one week&apos;s suspension. The debris has been taken to Farnborough to be examined by the AAIB. Meanwhile, the helicopter operators and oil companies have a further, serious, problem: confidence in their helicopters is extremely low. A recent poll by Unite found that 53% of its members are not confident about their safety. Airbus Helicopters president and CEO, Guillaume Faury, asked last September about the previous month&apos;s crash, said, &quot;The Super Pumas&apos; overall safety record is excellent. One reason there are so many in the North Sea oil and gas business is their safety.&quot; But he also admitted: &quot;We have reputation and image damage in the UK that we must face.&quot; Ask survivors what the problem is and the answer is immediate; they seem surprised I even ask. &quot;Money.&quot; Sharp rubs thumb and forefinger together. &quot;Money,&quot; says Nugent. Balpa has said it is particularly concerned by &quot;cut-throat&quot; competition between helicopter operators bidding for oil firm contracts. Buckley notes that in the 1990s the oil companies brought in an initiative called Crine. &quot;It stood for Cost Reduction In the New Era and was the basis for oil companies cutting back on routine maintenance, and other cost-saving measures. It doesn&apos;t formally exist now, but the ethos is still very prevalent.&quot; Suggest there might be pressures on maintenance, however, and the unions say there cannot be \u2013 everything is controlled from Europe; leave a lightbulb in a day too long and you might lose your job. Oil &amp; Gas UK retorts that Balpa has yet to produce evidence, and that in January helicopter operators told the transport select committee there was no commercial pressure \u2013 but &quot;there is competition and safety is not jeopardised&quot;. Certainly there is an ostentatious fetishisation of safety: in the land-based CHC offices, I must hold the handrail going up steps and even on the level, which feels ridiculous. Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle, who conducted the inquiry into the 2009 crash off Fraserburgh, concluded this month that &quot;everyone in [Bond Offshore Helicopters] well knew that maintenance must be done by the book. On one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken. It resulted in the failure to detect a significant fault in the helicopter&apos;s gearbox, which possibly \u2013 but only possibly \u2013 resulted in the crash.&quot; &quot;Everything affects safety,&quot; Buckley says. &quot;If the pilots are frustrated because they&apos;re delayed \u2013 you&apos;ve started engines, you&apos;re burning fuel, you miss your slot, you&apos;re at the back of the queue, then you have to taxi back to get more fuel \u2013 these are little holes that are beginning to line up. It&apos;s not just one person, it&apos;s everybody who&apos;s involved. It includes the managers, it includes the culture.&quot; And there is a fear of speaking up. &quot;It&apos;s supposed to be a no-blame culture,&quot; Sharp says. When you report a safety issue on the rigs, &quot;you&apos;re supposed to put your name at the bottom, but a lot of people leave that blank&quot;. Of course, safety on the rigs is different from safety on the helicopters, but it is probably instructive to look at aspects of the wider North Sea culture. There used to be, for instance, a culture of blacklisting, or NRB \u2013 Not Required Back. &quot;They say you can&apos;t NRB anyone any more. That&apos;s rubbish,&quot; Sharp says, and laughs. After the incident in August, the oil companies made a show of saying they would not force anyone to fly, but it&apos;s difficult to see what choice they have. There are already stories of workers mentioning they are afraid of the helicopters, only to be told, &quot;If you don&apos;t think they&apos;re safe, son, find yourself another career.&quot; Sharp says: &quot;That&apos;s why people don&apos;t say anything. They&apos;re afraid.&quot; &quot;After the accident, a lot of safety reps emailed us with questions,&quot; says John Taylor at Unite. &quot;Every one asked to be kept anonymous.&quot; Are there issues with pilot training? Buckley wonders if they do enough hours on automatics. The autopilot systems are radically different on each variant of the Super Puma. Do they need to support copilots better? &quot;Some copilots with low hours don&apos;t have a lot of confidence, and if you&apos;re flying next to a grizzled captain who doesn&apos;t like copilots anyway\u2026&quot; When a Sikorsky S92 crashed off Newfoundland in March 2009, killing all but one on board, Buckley says this was found to be one of the reasons: the copilot suggested, three times, that they ditch, but the captain overruled him. But the most urgent thing, right now, is why did four people die last August? In mid-December, the BBC reported that, according to the AAIB, the crash was &quot;survivable&quot; and that the death certificates for three of the four fatalities recorded drowning as the cause of death (the fourth was Gary McCrossan, who died of a heart attack). Survivors, and offshore workers polled by Unite, are clear: put fewer people on the helicopters, Sharp says \u2013 16 at most \u2013 and change the seat configuration so that more people are closer to the windows. (When, after the crash, Nugent told another worker where he had been sitting, he discovered it was known as &quot;the death seat&quot;.) Training should be made more realistic. The window Sharp dragged himself out of was, he\u00a0estimates, only just over a foot high and 18 inches wide: &quot;In training, the windows are massive. In reality it doesn&apos;t work like that.&quot; He\u00a0suggests adding wave machines to give a\u00a0sense of actual sea, but this is not allowed: health and safety guidelines bar putting trainees under &quot;undue stress&quot;, says Matt Scaife at Falck Nutec, which runs many of these courses. By far the most difficult issue to broach is that of body mass. There is understandable sensitivity about this. Food is a\u00a0major morale booster in an industry in which there is no alcohol allowed (there is drug and alcohol testing at takeoff, and random bag searches) and there is nowhere to go; it also feels unfair to put pressure on men who&apos;ve spent years in the industry to lose weight. But as Nugent says: &quot;I&apos;ve looked at some of those guys and thought, there&apos;s no way you&apos;re going to fit through that window. Even if you were naked and greased up, you wouldn&apos;t fit.&quot; Buckley points out that those who did not survive the August crash were the larger people on the flight. &quot;I feel you should put on your survival suit, your life jacket, and try to get out of the smallest window in the smallest helicopter,&quot; Garcia says. &quot;If you can&apos;t do that, you need to get your weight down.&quot; At the end of February, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) published a 293-page safety review of offshore helicopter operations, stipulating that, from 1 April 2015, helicopter operators will be prohibited from carrying anyone &quot;whose body size, including required safety and survival equipment, is incompatible with push-out window emergency exit size&quot;. Most dramatically, from June this year, no one is allowed to sit in a seat not adjacent to a window or door, unless they have been provided with Category A breathing systems or the helicopter has side-floats \u2013 but the latter are not available and the former not certified (even if they were, the entire workforce would have to be trained to use them). Which means that, unless many new helicopters and pilots are made available in the next three months, the number of people who can be flown out to the rigs will be reduced by 40%, with an obvious impact on the industry. &quot;We welcome the recommendations in the CAA&apos;s report, especially those that encourage standardisation in safety procedures,&quot; says Melinda de Boer, director of communications at CHC. &quot;The industry is safer now than ever\u2026 It&apos;s also an industry that knows one accident, one injury, much less one loss of life, is too many.&quot; &quot;I have nothing but admiration for a chap prepared to work offshore in the environments they do,&quot; Buckley says, &quot;but there&apos;s a feeling that their wellbeing is not being thought of as perhaps it should be, and it manifests itself in the design of the helicopters.&quot; Nugent is blunter: &quot;Those helicopters are not fit for purpose \u2013 and what do you do with a piece of kit not fit for purpose? Scrap it. Simple as.&quot; It&apos;s not as if there isn&apos;t the money. &quot;We&apos;re talking about the oil and gas industry: these people make profits in the billions.&quot; Oil &amp; Gas UK points out that they do not own\u00a0the helicopters and, more pertinently, that it takes many years to design\u00a0them. The hope is that it will not take that long for the five current investigations into the August crash to report their findings, and in the meantime, life must go on. Bull tries not to think about it too hard. Sharp expected to be able to get a 15-minute test flight, then be back at work in January (&quot;It&apos;s not the flying that&apos;s the problem,&quot; he said drily, &quot;it&apos;s the crashing&quot;), but there have been endless delays and now: &quot;I&apos;m skint.&quot; He says he keeps being asked for paperwork \u2013 physiotherapists&apos; and counsellors&apos; reports, back-to-work certificates: &quot;We&apos;re the victims and we&apos;re doing all the running about.&quot; Garcia had such bad post-traumatic stress disorder that he only recently went back to work. Nugent, who fractured his spine, still has severe migraines if he exerts himself. He worked freelance for a\u00a0company called Axiom; unlike those with permanent jobs, he has not been paid since the crash. He struggles with the surrealness of it \u2013 the sudden rent in normality, which stretches out as usual on either side \u2013 and never wants to get in a\u00a0helicopter again. He has flashbacks during the day and still dreams about the crash: about struggling to get out and being unable to undo his seatbelt, about someone holding him back, about going back to find George, or Sarah, and either can&apos;t find them or can&apos;t find his way out again, can&apos;t work out which way is up and which is down. He is overwhelmed by guilt and wakes sweating, fighting his way out of the duvet, night after night."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/29/readers-digest-chinese-stooge-censorship", "sentences": ["They demanded censorship, even though the book was a Reader&apos;s Digest &quot;worldwide English edition&quot; for the Indian subcontinent, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore \u2013 not, you will note, for China."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-29T18:00:01Z", "title": "How Reader's Digest became a Chinese stooge | Nick Cohen", "tags": ["Reader's Digest", "China", "Censorship", "Publishing", "UK news", "Books", "Media", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "The notion that the formerly mighty American publisher Reader&apos;s Digest would allow the Chinese Communist party to censor its novels would once have appeared so outrageous as to be unimaginable. In the globalised world, what was once unimaginable is becoming commonplace, however. The Australian novelist LA (Louisa) Larkin has learned the hard way that old certainties no longer apply as the globalisation of trade leads to the globalisation of authoritarian power. The fate of her book is more than a lesson in modern cynicism. It is the most resonant example of collaboration between the old enemies of communism and capitalism I have encountered. Larkin published Thirst in 2012. She set her thriller in an Antarctic research station, where mercenaries besiege a team of scientists. Larkin was delighted when Reader&apos;s Digest said it would take her work for one of its anthologies of condensed novels. Thirst would reach a global audience and \u2013 who knows? \u2013 take off. Reader&apos;s Digest promised &quot;to ensure that neither the purpose nor the opinion of the author is distorted or misrepresented&quot;, and all seemed well. One of Larkin&apos;s characters trapped in the station is Wendy Woo, a Chinese-Australian. Woo fled to Australia because the Chinese authorities arrested her mother for being a member of the banned religious group Falun Gong. Larkin has her saying that she had not &quot;learned until much later of the horrific torture her mother had endured because she refused to recant&quot;. State oppression in China is not a major theme of a novel set in Antarctica. But Larkin needed to provide a back story for Woo and a link between her and the villains of her drama. In any case, she was a free author living in a free country and was free to express her abhorrence of torture and the denial of freedom of conscience. Or so she thought, until she discovered last week that she was not as free as she thought. The cost of printing makes up the largest part of the price of book production. Publishers have outsourced manufacturing to China, like so many other industries have done. The printing firm noticed the heretical passages in Larkin&apos;s novel. All references to Falun Gong had to go, it said, as did all references to agents of the Chinese state engaging in torture. They demanded censorship, even though the book was a Reader&apos;s Digest &quot;worldwide English edition&quot; for the Indian subcontinent, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore \u2013 not, you will note, for China. Phil Patterson from Larkin&apos;s London agents, Marjacq Scripts, tried to explain the basics for a free society to Reader&apos;s Digest. To allow China to engage in &quot;extraterritorial censorship&quot; of an Australian novelist writing for an American publisher would set a &quot;very dangerous precedent&quot;, he told its editors. Larkin told me she would have found it unconscionable to change her book to please a dictatorship. When she made the same point to Reader&apos;s Digest, it replied that if it insisted on defending freedom of publication, it would have to move the printing from China to Hong Kong at a cost of US$30,000. People ask: &quot;What price liberty?&quot; Reader&apos;s Digest has an answer that is precise to the last cent: the price of liberty is US$30,000. The publisher, from the home of Jefferson, Madison and the first amendment, decided last week to accept the ban and scrap the book. Globalisation has turned the world upside down. Reader&apos;s Digest was so anti-communist in the cold war that its enemies muttered that the CIA might as well have been funding it. They sneered at its middlebrow manners as much as its politics \u2013 &quot;I mean condensed novels for Christ&apos;s sake.&quot; In 1982, the sight of Solidarity, a genuinely working-class movement, rising against the Soviet occupation of Poland, disoriented the western left. Susan Sontag, who knew how to hurt when she had to, wiped the smiles from a few lips by raising the despised Digest. At a meeting at New York town hall attended by the publisher of the Nation, and many another eminent figures from the American left, she told her listeners that they had been so keen to defend the victims of McCarthyism and American capitalism that they had forgotten about the victims of Soviet communism. Imagine if you will, she continued, &quot;someone who read only the Reader&apos;s Digest between 1950 and 1970 and someone in the same period who read only the Nation or the New Statesman. Which reader would have been better informed about the realities of communism? The answer, I think, should give us pause. Can it be that our enemies were right?&apos;&apos; The audience booed her. But although you can find many on the left as indifferent to universal human rights today, I&apos;ll say one thing for them: no one can smack them over the head with Reader&apos;s Digest now. During the cold war, business had to be anti-communist. The communists wanted to take capitalists&apos; money and, on occasion, to kill them too. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the rise of the state capitalist dictatorships in Russia and China, defending free speech, defending even the right of an author to criticise torture in passing, may risk the chance to profit. For if China offers the cheapest printers and a huge market, who wants to alienate its leaders? No one, if the grotesque spectacle of the &quot;market focus on China&quot; at last year&apos;s London Book Fair was a guide. The British Council and the British book trade kept the Communist party sweet by refusing to invite any Chinese &quot;visiting authors&quot; whose work had upset the regime. When the Chinese Communist party was Maoist, Reader&apos;s Digest denounced it. Now it guarantees profits, Reader&apos;s Digest censors on its behalf. When Putin was in the KGB, bankers, lawyers and industrialists deplored the old Soviet Union. Now Putin is in the Kremlin, they ensure that the first aim of David Cameron&apos;s advisers in the Ukraine crisis is to do nothing that might &quot;close London&apos;s financial centre to Russians&quot;. Everyone knows LP Hartley&apos;s line: &quot;The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.&quot; If that were ever true, it isn&apos;t now. For most people, the present is foreign and frightening. The intellectual left that Sontag so magnificently upbraided in 1982 had little real power. You only had to look at it to see that. By contrast, the publishers, banks and corporations, who have taken over the role of deferring to Moscow and Beijing, have power and money and the ability to use both."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/31/darwin-a-complicated-but-dazzling-history", "sentences": ["Repulsed from expanding their empire, the Dutch returned their focus to the Straits of Malacca, the skinny stretch of water between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-31T03:36:10Z", "title": "Darwin: Australia\u2019s most militarised city, and a lily pad for the Pentagon | Tess Lea", "tags": ["Australia news", "Australian politics"], "article": "In his recent book Anzac\u2019s Long Shadow: The Cost of our National Obsession, former ADF soldier James Brown correlates deep Australian ignorance about our contemporary military with our increasingly fantastical commemoration of the Anzac legend. Bedazzled by myths of Gallipoli, Australians neglect more pressing defence policy concerns.  It\u2019s a compelling thesis, and one that closely parallels the situation in one of Australia\u2019s most militarised city, Darwin.  Australians prefer to see the isolated and exotic city of Darwin through stories about cyclones, crocodiles, Aboriginal art, spicy market food and unlimited road speeds; a place that lets you go to the supermarket in bare feet and look normal. This way, we don\u2019t have to notice the most significant militarisation effort in Australia\u2019s post-war history, which is happening under our noses. The militarisation of the north is unknown to most of us and thanks to this ignorance, the new Cold War brewing in the Asia Pacific region, and Darwin\u2019s place in it, is rarely being debated. In 2012, US president Barrack Obama hailed &quot;the next proud chapter in our alliance&quot;, announcing that up to 2,500 US Marine Corp personnel would permanently rotate through Darwin. The city is now a &quot;lily pad&quot; (the base America has when it doesn\u2019t need to build a mini-city, just permanent access to a subordinate state\u2019s geographic and strategic resources), adding to the largest empire of &quot;not-really-bases&quot; the world has ever known. Darwin\u2019s geo-strategic identity is a form of what old-school military manuals called &quot;dazzle camouflage&quot;, where a combination of spectacle and background blending disrupts perception. Blinded by what is seen, the true dimensions of a thing escape view: Darwin is a garrison town that isn\u2019t known as one, despite having been sculpted by defence. The first dam for drinking water was installed by the military; the Stuart Highway (Australia\u2019s &quot;Burma Road&quot;) was completed by soldiers. All air traffic at Darwin International Airport is controlled by the Royal Australian Air Force, for Darwin sits underneath the largest aerial defence training space in the world. Of course, well before becoming a lily pad for the Pentagon\u2019s pivot to Asia, Darwin became an important part of the global-technological security apparatus when, in the 1950s, mining began at Rum Jungle, 60kms to Darwin\u2019s south, to supply uranium to the British and American nuclear weapons programs. For years, locals swam in the pit of that old mine, unaware that all biota for 15km down the Finniss River had been destroyed, and over 100 square km of surrounding floodplains contaminated.     A ceremony commemorating the Darwin bombing raid on 18 February 1942, which saw Japanese aircraft kill at least 243 people when they took the city by surprise. Photograph: AAP    During the second world war, the Top End was targeted by Japanese bombers for over 18 months. The most famous of these raids was the bombing of Darwin in February 1942, shortly after Pearl Harbour. More Americans than Australians died during the raids, many in unmarked sea graves. Today, this history of blood debt helps deflect any criticisms of what becoming a node in a US military map is drawing Australians into. This is also how the US Marine Corps have bedazzled Darwin, not by concealing their presence but by broadcasting it. The &quot;first long-term expansion of the American military\u2019s presence in the Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War&quot; has so far seen marines supporting the Aboriginal football academy, patiently fielding questions at information booths, playing with school children, and comparing their fitness coaching techniques to those of Australian soldiers.  Impressed, one forgets that Australia has sustained continual military action since 1999, from East Timor to Afghanistan and Iraq. In fact, a Roy Morgan poll before the last election listed defence issues as the second least important concern (outranked in unimportance by the needs of people outside of cities). Even for the ABC\u2019s supposedly more politically aware constituency, less than 1% of respondents rated defence as the upmost election issue, compared with almost 13% rating asylum seekers. The historian Regina Ganter makes the powerful point that Australian history begins in the north \u2013 not the south. Australia\u2019s first international seafarers arrived this way, and many thousands of years later, a lucrative market in sea cucumbers made Top End Aboriginal groups veteran international traders long before British colonists arrived.  In fact, when he was circumnavigating Australia, Matthew Flinders relied on Dutch maps of Australia\u2019s northern coastline drafted in the 1600s. The Dutch United East India Company had been sniffing around the manganese-rich Aboriginal lands in search of things to rip and ship, but had been repelled in their efforts by Australia\u2019s original homeland security, at one time with a force of over 200 Aboriginal warriors, &quot;in spite of our especial kindness and fair semblance,&quot; a frustrated Jan Carstensz wrote in his field reports.  Having repelled the Dutch, unimpressed by their nutmeg and beads, Aboriginal patriots fought outnumbered, out-legislated battles against the Martini-Henry military rifles and biological warfare of invading settlers. Dispossession bequeathed land the size of Cyprus to Bradshaw Station, first for cattle, and now as the Bradshaw Field Training Area, one of the largest weapons training grounds in the world. Repulsed from expanding their empire, the Dutch returned their focus to the Straits of Malacca, the skinny stretch of water between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Only 2.7km at its narrowest point, the Straits are a geographical chokepoint. Controlling the Straits, the Dutch controlled their empire. As the shortest sea route between the Gulf countries and Asia, today\u2019s Straits are China\u2019s and Indonesia\u2019s energy corridor. Australia\u2019s too for that matter. If blocked, nearly half the world\u2019s fleet would need to reroute through the Indonesian archipelago. Handy, then, for a military hegemon to have sea-air striking range from a docile little place like Darwin. While the mustering of force in Australia\u2019s northern reaches can be interpreted as merely strengthening defence capabilities against an attack on continental Australia (purportedly our primary security threat), the imperial intent of our main ally, and the propensity for our defence deployments to threaten our neighbours must be interrogated far more thoroughly than is now the case. In allowing Australia\u2019s foreign policy interests to be played out of sight, out of mind, in a town that also hides its own nature from itself, we avoid debating difficult questions.

Greenpeace thinks so. The NGO is using the lever of P&amp;G&apos;s big name in an attempt to spur industry-wide change in the sourcing of palm oil. The campaign group recently concluded a year-long investigation into P&amp;G&apos;s supply chain, looking at the source of the palm oil the multinational uses as an ingredient in its household brands such as Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo and Gillette shaving gel. Greenpeace also launched a petition, since signed by more than 300,000 consumers globally, calling on P&amp;G to improve its practices. &quot;If a well known company like Procter &amp; Gamble can show leadership to clean up supply chains, we expect other companies will follow,&quot; said Bustar Maitar, global head of Greenpeace&apos;s Indonesia Forest Campaign. Like 1,300 other companies from 50 countries, P&amp;G is a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), a certification standard launched in 2004 to ensure that companies could continue to manufacture foods and personal products without cutting down tropical forests, thus destroying habitat for endangered animals and causing carbon dioxide emissions from the land-use change.  But thanks to opaque supply chains, the Roundtable is not actually preventing the destruction of forests and peatlands, according to a Greenpeace report published last fall.  &quot;On the ground, we&apos;ve seen lots of RSPO members still doing forest clearing in the area, which is an indication of weak enforcement and a weak standard,&quot; said Maitar. &quot;RSPO, from my perspective, has been used for green washing by companies who want to expand their plantations into the forest.&quot; Leading the way While calling out P&amp;G specifically via the petition, Greenpeace also published a related report that reviewed a range of multinational companies and their track records on this issue. The NGO cited another company as a leader: Nestl\u00e9. In 2010, the multinational food corporation committed to a no deforestation policy, including 100% traceability. The company is currently implementing its policies and reporting its progress transparently, according to Greenpeace. Duncan Pollard, Nestl\u00e9&apos;s head of stakeholder engagement in sustainability, said that deforestation is a complex issue, but &quot;now we&apos;re seeing a wave of ambition to tackle this that is sweeping the industry.&quot; Nestl\u00e9 mapped its supply chains, and last year, after six months of research, it published the first global maps of deforestation that went beyond the national level so suppliers, competitors, and NGOs could use them. But as of a month ago, a superior mapping tool was rolled out by the World Resources Institute, said Pollard. Global Forest Watch publicly shares fresh satellite data to track deforestation. These maps now help Nestl\u00e9 target its on-the-ground audits, said Pollard. Campaign groups like Greenpeace can also use these maps. &quot;It makes it difficult for any company to hide from knowledge of what&apos;s happening,&quot; said Pollard. Is progress on the horizon? Joining P&amp;G on Greenpeace&apos;s &quot;non-forest-friendly&quot; side are Pepsi Co, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Colgate-Palmolive, among others. Rated &quot;forest-friendly&quot; along with Nestl\u00e9, are L&apos;Oreal, Unilever and Ferrero, makers of Ferrero Rocher chocolate and Nutella. Johnson &amp; Johnson says it doesn&apos;t intend to stay near the bottom of Greenpeace&apos;s list. &quot;We are in the process of developing a palm oil sourcing policy, with input from key stakeholders including NGOs such as Greenpeace,&quot; said Paulette Frank, vice president of sustainability for the company. &quot;We are also initiating a supply chain mapping project.&quot;\u00a0 Likewise, P&amp;G said it is committed to speaking with Greenpeace and other stakeholders regarding rainforest preservation. &quot;We agree that deforestation in the supply chain is not acceptable,&quot; said Paul Fox, director of corporate communications. &quot;This is a complex issue affecting many industries and will require strong collaboration and partnerships to develop the solutions\u00a0that are\u00a0needed.&quot; Responsible, rather than sustainable Last April, four palm oil producers and four NGOs, including Greenpeace, formed the Palm Oil Innovation Group (POIG), which hopes to stop deforestation caused by the palm oil industry. Other founding members are WWF, Rainforest Action Network, Forest Peoples Programme, Brazil-based Acropalma Vegetable Oils and Fats, Golden Agri-Resources from Singapore, Columbia-based Daabon Organic and New Britain Palm Oil Limited, headquartered in Papua New Guinea. POIG members WWF and Rainforest Action Network have also published palm oil reports that rate companies&apos; policies, transparency, and supply chains. WWF also gives high marks to Unilever, L&apos;Oreal and Nestl\u00e9, and low scores to P&amp;G, Colgate-Palmolive and PepsiCo. But it rates Johnson &amp; Johnson higher than Greenpeace does. Because just 15% of the world&apos;s palm oil was certified sustainable in 2013, some companies&apos; commitments to buy 100% sustainable palm oil by 2015 are being fulfilled via virtual certificates, sort of like carbon credits. It is difficult to prove that the certificates actually support an increase in sustainable palm oil. &quot;People have hidden behind the easy options and have pushed the problem down the supply chain \u2013 and conveniently forgotten that they are a player in the supply chain and have a duty to source responsibly,&quot; said Simon Lord, group director for sustainability for New Britain Palm Oil.  Earlier this month, the POIG issued an invitation for progressive palm oil players to join its initiative in the hopes of increasing both global demand and supply of &quot;responsible&quot; palm oil. Lord said founders believe the term &quot;sustainable&quot; has lost credibility. Partnering for good Watchdog groups are sometimes seen as the bane of corporate existence. But the tough love approach Greenpeace is taking with P&amp;G has a track record of working. &quot;We exposed Nestl\u00e9 as a company [contributing to] deforestation by sourcing from Golden Agri-Resources,&quot; said Greenpeace&apos;s Maitar.  &quot;After a couple of months, Nestl\u00e9 made a no deforestation commitment and began cleaning up its supply chain.&quot;  Likewise, Golden Agri-Resources made a no deforestation commitment in 2011. And Wilmar International, a Singapore-based company that processes or trades more than 45% of the world&apos;s palm oil, just committed in December to supplying palm oil that does not cause deforestation or violate human rights. Corporations&apos; relationships with NGOs can be a partnership, said Chris Hogg, Nestl\u00e9&apos;s deputy head of corporate media relations. &quot;They&apos;re also a series of eyes and ears on the ground,&quot; he said. &quot;And if they find something, we take it seriously and look into it.&quot; Erica Gies is an independent reporter who covers water and energy for The New York Times, The Economist, Scientific American, and other publications."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/01/rents-london-prime-properties-fall-2013", "sentences": ["That puts the city slightly ahead of New York (up 19.6%) and sharply ahead of Hong Kong and Singapore, where rents in luxury properties are yet to regain their 2008 peak."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-01T09:43:00Z", "title": "Rents on London's prime properties fell 2.3% in 2013", "tags": ["Renting property", "Property", "Money", "Financial sector", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Rents on properties in prime central London dropped by 2.3% in 2013, according to luxury letting agents Knight Frank, with much of the fall coming in the last three months of the year.

Knight Frank said the average prime central London apartment is letting for 20.9% above the price achieved at the time of Lehman&apos;s collapse in 2008. That puts the city slightly ahead of New York (up 19.6%) and sharply ahead of Hong Kong and Singapore, where rents in luxury properties are yet to regain their 2008 peak. &quot;Slowing prime rental growth in Hong Kong is attributable to the reduction in housing allowances and fewer expat arrivals.

The results suggest that pupils in England are better equipped to overcome difficulties by applying their skills dynamically than they are able to perform in traditional examinations that simply test retained knowledge. The OECD&apos;s head of early childhood and schools division, Michael Davidson, said: &quot;Problem solving is where England comes out relatively strong. If you value those skills \u2013 and they are obviously valued by employers \u2013 the demand for those problem-solving skills is strong and growing, then clearly England is producing skills for students that match what the growing demand of the labour market is.&quot; The results placed England at 11th out of 28 countries in successful problem solving, with only Finland ahead of it among European countries, while the United States was ranked 18th. Singapore, South Korea and Japan were at the top of the table, while Australia and Canada ranked eighth and ninth respectively and Germany placed 17th. The results are in contrast to the main 2012 Pisa subject tests, which put the UK \u2013 including Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland \u2013 in 26th place for maths, 23rd for reading and 21st for science, compared with 15-year-olds in 44 countries. The latest results also reveal that pupils in England are better at problem solving than their counterparts elsewhere with the same academic abilities. In a like-for-like comparison, England came seventh overall, while China&apos;s Shanghai region \u2013 which topped the Pisa academic tests \u2013 fell by 51 places. The director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, Prof Alan Smithers, said: &quot;England does much better in problem-solving than its performance in maths, science and reading led us to suppose. The top performers again are Singapore, Korea and Japan, giving the lie to the charge that their excellent performance in the Pisa subject tests is due to drilling. But those who suspect Shanghai&apos;s astounding performance in the subject tests will not be surprised that its performance in problem solving is massively down.&quot; A Department for Education spokesperson said: &quot;These results show our young people are strong in problem solving \u2013 this is a skill we should build on. But they also confirm that generally those who perform best in maths, reading and science \u2013 Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong and South Korea \u2013 are also those who do best in problem solving.&quot; In one of the interactive problems set by the OECD, pupils had to purchase a train ticket at the best price using a ticket machine. But a fault in the machine meant that an eligible discount fare was not available, so successful students were those who realised they had to purchase a full-fare ticket. In another problem, students had to figure out how to work an unfamiliar air conditioning unit, by correctly using three controls to adjust a room&apos;s temperature and humidity. The general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Brian Lightman, said the results were &quot;another reason to be proud of our education system&quot;. He said: &quot;Graduates need core knowledge in subjects like maths and English, but they also need to be able to apply this to tackle complex and unpredictable tasks with confidence.

Matthews joined in March 2008 in the wake of the shambolic Terminal 5 opening and has overseen a gradual restoration of Heathrow&apos;s reputation, although he presided over one public relations disaster in December 2010 when a snow flurry paralysed the airport. As well as operating Britain&apos;s main international gateway, his successor faces a tough political challenge in persuading the three main parties to back a new runway \u2013 an option being considered by the independent airports commission. Matthews said he had decided the time was right to &quot;pass on the baton&quot; and will leave after the new Terminal 2 is opened in June. &quot;I&apos;ll be 70 by the time the thing [a new runway] opens. It&apos;s impossible to see through to the absolute end. It&apos;s not going to be over any time soon. It&apos;s been a great six years and it&apos;s appropriate that someone takes it on to the next phase,&quot; he told the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference. The most prominent internal candidate is the development director, John Holland-Kaye, who is charged with the Terminal 2 revamp, but previous appointments have come from outside the airport group, which dropped its former title of BAA when Heathrow sold its other London airports Stansted and Gatwick. Under Matthews customer satisfaction has increased markedly at Heathrow. According to the airport&apos;s statistics, the proportion of passengers rating their journey through Heathrow as good or excellent went up from less than 50% to more than 75%. After its opening day fiasco, when undertrained staff grappled with a new baggage system leading to hundreds of flight cancellations, Terminal 5 has established itself as one of the world&apos;s finest airport terminals. Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of Heathrow, said: &quot;Colin has done a fantastic job of improving Heathrow for passengers and will remain as chief executive until his successor is in place to ensure a smooth transition.&quot; While Heathrow&apos;s performance was not blemish-free in the first half of Matthews&apos; tenure \u2013 notably over Christmas 2010 when five inches of snow caused chaos \u2013 \u2013 it avoided a potential pitfall with a smooth operation during the Olympics. Matthews, 57, who joined from utility group Severn Trent, has seen his tenure dominated by the debate over expansion. The airport had plans for a third runway finally approved by Labour in 2009, before they were scrapped the following year by the coalition. Matthews has since overseen a discreetly judged lobbying effort that culminated in the government setting up the Airports Commission, which next year will recommend building additional runways at either Heathrow or Gatwick. News of Matthewss departure came as Heathrow decided not to fight the cap on landing charges set by the Civil Aviation Authority for the next five years, a ruling the airport had described as a draconian position that could curb investment. Heathrow&apos;s biggest shareholder remains Ferrovial, the Spanish construction firm, although it has cut its stake substantially to a third since it led a consortium that bought BAA in 2006. The sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, Singapore and China snapped up Ferrovial&apos;s shares controlling a combined shareholding of more than 40%. The remainder is owned by the Canadian pension fund Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec and the private equity firm Alinda Capital Partners. Heathrow claims that its shareholders could be put off investing in expanding and improving the airport after the CAA announced a cut in charges by 1.5% below the rate of inflation each year from 2014-19, to \u00a319.10 per passenger. Airlines including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, who had complained that charges would remain excessively high and drive up fares, have also accepted the decision for the next five-year period, known as Q6. In a statement on Tuesday morning, the airport said: &quot;Heathrow has not exercised its right to appeal [against] the CAA&apos;s final Q6 regulatory decision. We understand that other parties have chosen not to appeal [against] the CAA&apos;s decision. We are focused on delivering our business plan for 2014-18 and further improving Heathrow for passengers.&quot; Challenges facing the new chief executive 1 Build a new runway The big task facing Matthews&apos; successor. Heathrow&apos;s detailed expansion plans for a third runway should be submitted to the independent airports commission, led by Sir Howard Davies, before the new boss is in place. But experience suggests that winning the competition with Gatwick for a new London runway will be only the start of the battle. The airport will still have to convince ministers and local politicians \u2013 let alone neighbouring communities and environmentalists \u2013 to accept the case for a runway. There is plenty more lobbying, consultation and wooing of public opinion ahead. 2 Avoid disruption Even if Heathrow eventually gets a new runway, it is going to be operating at the limit of landings and take-offs for the next decade or so, making it vulnerable to severe disruption. A mild winter has kept cancellations to a minimum, but the flooding debacle at Gatwick in January is a reminder of how the weather can test the best-laid plans. At least passengers stranded in the new Terminal 2 will have a nicer place to sleep if floods, snow, wind or fog strikes. 3 Keep airlines, staff, passengers and shareholders happy Matthews has departed as the curtain fell on the public pantomime of airlines demanding a cut in landing charges. Heathrow has called for higher returns to keep sweet its array of foreign shareholders (which include the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar and China). The next settlement will likely come towards the end of Matthews&apos; successor&apos;s time, but for now the regulator has decided to trim the fees, rejecting Heathrow&apos;s arguments that lower income could mean cuts in investment. The well-rehearsed argument is that multi-billion-pound investments such as Terminals 2 and 5 need a stable regulatory environment, while Heathrow&apos;s detractors argue that the business is a monopolistic cash and profit machine that owns Britain&apos;s only international airport. Airlines \u2013 led by the cost-conscious Willie Walsh of British Airways&apos;s parent International Airlines Group \u2013 say it is time for the airport to cut costs. That could mean fewer staff, but no airport boss will want to risk jeopardising Heathrow&apos;s hard-won turnaround of its dismal reputation among the travelling public."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/02/tougher-marking-gcses-peg-grades-chinese-students-results", "sentences": ["At the urging of the education secretary, Michael Gove, Ofqual has unveiled a plan to link GCSE grades to levels achieved by pupils in China, Singapore and other countries deemed to be high-performing.", "Stacey said the new benchmark grade 5 &quot;should be more demanding and in line with high-performing countries&quot; and added: &quot;In simple terms and put crudely, that means grade five will be set about a half to two-thirds higher than where current grade C boundaries are set at the moment.&quot; The performance of students in England has recently lagged behind cities and countries such as Shanghai in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, as measured by the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) education survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.", "Pegging the standard for specific GCSE grades to countries that do well in Pisa follows the modelling of the new mathematics course content on that used in Singapore \u2013 a country where students still sit O-levels, set by an examinations board in England."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-02T21:47:19Z", "title": "Tougher marking of GCSEs will peg grades to Chinese students' results", "tags": ["Education", "Exams", "GCSEs", "Singapore", "China", "Michael Gove", "UK news", "Politics"], "article": "England&apos;s GCSE pupils will be benchmarked against their Chinese counterparts from 2017, in a response from exam regulators to ministers&apos; calls to toughen up a marking system they say has been discredited by years of grade inflation. At the urging of the education secretary, Michael Gove, Ofqual has unveiled a plan to link GCSE grades to levels achieved by pupils in China, Singapore and other countries deemed to be high-performing. Glenys Stacey, Ofqual chief regulator, conceded that the watchdog was responding to a written request from Gove that exams should be more demanding because international tables suggest the UK has fallen behind even as results appear to have improved. But the idea of an international educational currency prompted concern from teaching unions, who said some countries excluded certain types of children to boost their scores in international tests. Ofqual&apos;s proposal is that the midpoint for the new GCSE grading system \u2013 five, on its new scale of results running upwards from one to nine \u2013 should be much higher than those currently needed to earn a GCSE C grade, based on its analysis of test results submitted by pupils from the world&apos;s leading economies. Stacey said the new benchmark grade 5 &quot;should be more demanding and in line with high-performing countries&quot; and added: &quot;In simple terms and put crudely, that means grade five will be set about a half to two-thirds higher than where current grade C boundaries are set at the moment.&quot; The performance of students in England has recently lagged behind cities and countries such as Shanghai in China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, as measured by the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) education survey from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. However, Shanghai&apos;s ranking is distorted as the city excludes migrant children from official schools. Brian Lightman, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Pisa \u2013 which surveys a small sample of 15-year-olds in each country taking part \u2013 was not an appropriate benchmark to use for a reform of GCSEs. &quot;While we understand the government&apos;s wish to raise the bar by aligning some grades to Pisa, this raises all kinds of issues. Pisa is a completely different kind of exam than the new GCSEs,&quot; he said. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), said that while he broadly welcomed the reforms introduced by Ofqual, its use of Pisa results was worrying. &quot;There are some technical issues that cause us concern, a notable example being the proposed use of Pisa data to set the standard for the new grade five, which, regrettably in NAHT&apos;s view, has come to be known as the &apos;pass&apos; grade,&quot; Hobby said. In the most recent Pisa survey, published last year, English students achieved marks of 500 in reading and 495 in maths. By contrast, Shanghai students scored 570 in reading and 613 in maths, and Hong Kong 545 and 561 respectively. The move is the latest step in the overhaul of GCSE and A-level exams and course content ordered by Gove two years ago, which has seen course modules and the use of assessment either curtailed or abolished in favour of more traditional, exam-based results. Pegging the standard for specific GCSE grades to countries that do well in Pisa follows the modelling of the new mathematics course content on that used in Singapore \u2013 a country where students still sit O-levels, set by an examinations board in England. Stacey said Ofqual&apos;s proposals were open to change, and it would be conducting regional consultations to gauge public opinion, especially from teachers and parents. &quot;I&apos;ll be very interested there to see how people respond to that. &quot;I&apos;ll be very interested to see if people have got any other ideas as to how one actually does an international benchmark.&quot; Under the new GCSE marking regime proposed by Ofqual, the grade of four will equate to a C under the current system, while seven, eight and nine would be equivalent to existing A and A* results. Ofqual said that while the same proportion of pupils would get seven or above as currently get A or above, the top grade of nine will be awarded to half those students who currently achieve the highest grade of A*. In 2013, 3.6% of students gained an A* in English \u2013 meaning that only the top 1.8% of candidates would achieve the new nine grade to be awarded in 2017. Stacey said: &quot;It is vital that people engage with these issues, as many will need to think about how they will use the new grading structure to make decisions about students applying for work or\u00a0education.&quot; The Department for Education declined to directly respond to Ofqual&apos;s consultation document, but a DfE source said: &quot;Rising results year after year masked the fact that standards were stagnating. In future the top grade will be awarded only for top performance. &quot;We hope these reforms will raise standards and restore trust in the exam system for families, for employers and for the pupils themselves.&quot; Ofqual is also seeking views on whether the very bottom grade \u2013 currently a G \u2013 should be abolished entirely and replaced by unclassified, so that the current grade of F would equate to the new 1 grade. The watchdog also announced that a new national reference test would be introduced to provide extra information about the performance of the year group in order to calibrate GCSE grades. This test would only be applied to a nationally representative sample of pupils around the same time as they were about to sit GCSEs. Ofqual would analyse the results to check that its statistical models fitted the pattern of grades that each year group could earn, allowing it to adjust grade boundaries if a year group performed better or worse than expected. The tests will be conducted in English and maths, and the DfE has already agreed to fund them. Stacey said the new test would be more consistent than the results obtained from GCSE performance. Lightman said that headteachers &quot;welcome the proposal to introduce a reference test, which will help to make an objective judgment about whether standards have improved or not year or year&quot;. But he warned that &quot;many parts of the puzzle remain missing&quot; in preparing for the introduction of the new GCSE courses in maths and English from September next year. &quot;Until it is made clear to teachers what students need to know in order to achieve a grade, and they have detailed specifications and sample questions, they will not be able to plan for these examinations,&quot; Lightman said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/03/birmingham-san-francisco-oslo-global-green-biophilic-cities-club", "sentences": ["Photograph: Peter Lopeman/Alamy    Charities and other organisations working to improve the natural environment in Birmingham welcomed membership of the exclusive biophilic club, which also includes Singapore, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Portland and Vitoria-Gasteiz in the Basque Country."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-03T14:47:24Z", "title": "Birmingham joins San Francisco and Oslo in global green cities club", "tags": ["Green space", "Cities", "Birmingham", "UK news", "Environment", "Travel"], "article": "The city of Birmingham is renowned for its great industrial history, vibrant cosmopolitan communities, an extensive canal system (larger than that of Venice) and, at a push, its football clubs.

He said: \u201cLess attention, however, has been focused on the city or urban scale, despite the fact that the planet continues an inexorable trend in the direction of urbanisation. Urban residents need nature more than ever, and much work is needed to find creative and effective means for incorporating it into urban environments.\u201d Beatley was in Birmingham this week for a conference on urban trees hosted by the Institute of Chartered Foresters \u2013 and was pleased by just how green the city turned out to be. He visited Sutton Park, a national nature reserve and the largest urban park in Europe, and enjoyed tramping around the heathland there. \u201cThat&apos;s a remarkable place.\u201d Beatley was also impressed by the refurbished canal basins that provide relief from the pubs and clubs of the teeming Broad Street and by some of the city&apos;s squares. \u201cI&apos;m pleasantly surprised \u2013 Birmingham is a remarkably green city,\u201d he said.

Photograph: Peter Lopeman/Alamy    Charities and other organisations working to improve the natural environment in Birmingham welcomed membership of the exclusive biophilic club, which also includes Singapore, Milwaukee, Phoenix, Portland and Vitoria-Gasteiz in the Basque Country. John Box, chair of the Birmingham and Black Country Local Nature Partnership, said: \u201cBirmingham has a superb network of blue and green infrastructure: parks, canals, nature reserves, rivers, woodlands and open spaces that connect the city centre with the open countryside.\u201d The Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country flagged up initiatives it has led such as the transfer of wild flowers from meadows in Worcestershire to inner city sites including Castle Vale, where they used to build and test Spitfires. Alison Milward, the trust&apos;s vice chair, said: \u201cBirmingham is a city that understands how important the natural environment is to the social and economic wellbeing of our citizens.\u201d Nick Grayson, climate change and sustainability manager at the city council, said Birmingham faced many and varied challenges ranging from a surprising tendency to be hit by flooding \u2013 though it has no major river \u2013 and inner city neighbourhoods that turn into \u201curban heat islands\u201d when the temperature soars. Grayson reeled of the statistics that show how (literally) green Birmingham is \u2013 571 parks, more than 3,500 hectares of public accessible space, 250 miles of urban brooks and streams. He emphasised the \u201cbiophilic\u201d status should not be taken as recognition that Birmingham has done enough \u2013 but that it may be going in the right direction. Birmingham has developed ambitious strategies and targets as it aims to make the city as green as possible. Last year it launched its \u201cgreen vision\u201d covering topics ranging from planning to transport and energy. It has also pledged to reduce C02 emissions by 60% by 2027 from 1990 levels.  Pat Laughlin, chief executive of the Business Council for Sustainable Development, said: \u201cBirmingham has an ambition to become a world leading &apos;green&apos; city.

What do you need to know about the new key stage 1 tests? Last week the government announced that from 2016 students will be formally tested when they start and leave primary school. In this useful blog post, teacher Michael Tidd sets out exactly how reading, maths, grammar, punctuation and spelling will be examined. With reading, between 60% and 90% of marks will be awarded for comprehension, up to 30% given for inference and up to 10% for understanding language for effect. In maths, students will take two papers. One will look at the child&apos;s out-of-context calculation skills and the other will test fluency, reasoning and problem-solving. When it comes to the spelling, grammar and punctuation papers, handwriting will be one of the features assessed. You can find out more on the changes on the blog Ramblings of a Teacher. Does education still have a place for me? Am I a stalwart or am I a dinosaur? asks headteacher John Tomsett in this piece that reflects on whether the radically changing landscape of education still holds a place for him after 25 years in the profession. John talks about how with all this change his thoughts on what is right for schools are at times unravelling into uncertainty. And it is this questioning \u2013 coupled with his strength of conviction \u2013 that makes the piece so interesting. He writes: &quot;If the Conservatives win the next election I would say that forced academisation is inevitable. And I don&apos;t know what I think about that anymore. &quot;All my great colleagues on the headteachers&apos; roundtable thinktank lead academies; I&apos;m the exception. Should we allow state schools to be run for profit? I&apos;m pretty sure that they shouldn&apos;t, but many think schools-for-profit is an acceptable concept. &quot;Funding cuts make my working life increasingly hard. Yet the cost of setting up the Harris Westminster Sixth Form for high-achieving students is purportedly \u00a345m, or \u00a390,000 per student. Is that right? I don&apos;t know, but some people seem sure it is.&quot; It&apos;s a post that I read, and then read again, similarly unsure about what I think about it all. You can read the full article on his blog John Tomsett. What&apos;s it like to work in a pupil referral unit? This week I came across a moving blog post from a teacher who works in a pupil referral unit (PRU). It&apos;s the first piece on their new blog, which they&apos;ve set up to shine a light on what they say can seem &quot;like a secretive world where more challenging students sometimes disappear to for half a term&quot;. The focus of the article is the physical aspects of working at the centre. They write: &quot;There are two types of student I see in the primary nurture class. There are the ones who genuinely lose their temper and don&apos;t know what they are doing. There will be shouting, swearing and probably some tears, usually a quick push or punch in the stomach for the teacher. &quot;The second type are the attention seekers. Children so psychologically damaged due to the abuse they have witnessed or been subjected to and only know attention for negative behaviour. Some students will actively seek to escalate the behaviour to such an extreme that they can no longer be considered safe to carry on and must be restrained or removed.&quot; The teacher talks about the different methods for responding to aggressive outbursts, including physical restraint, and how the centre is able to build trust with these young people. &quot;I can assure you the positives far outweigh the negatives,&quot; they write. &quot;The moments when you receive an unprompted thank you or even a small apology. You&apos;ll build a den together with sheets, you&apos;ll go for a unplanned walk somewhere, you&apos;ll dress up as a pirate and walk the plank. You&apos;ll play whatever game will help them forget and trust you more.&quot; You can read the full post on Teachanana. Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.

At the same time, other volunteers offer coding or data-crunching skills to civic initiatives, working with city officials, charities and advocacy groups. These people operate in silos, largely unaware of other groups working on similar projects. My goal is to start a conversation between deeply engaged creative workers \u2013 whether they be coders, designers, data analysts, visual artists, theatre performers, musicians, or other innovators \u2013 to prompt more effective and lasting collaborations. A good example of this in action can be found in the Occupy movement&apos;s response to Hurricane Sandy through the Occupy Sandy Wayfinding project. Mobile technology was used to direct low-income citizens living in areas without power to nearby relief centres. The project collected feedback on where signs were most needed using the crowdsourcing platform Crowdmap. Once those locations were ascertained, temporary signs directing citizens to nearby relief centres were screenprinted by artists and installed on power lines. Artists Michael Premo and Rachel Falcone launched Sandy Storyline, a documentary about Hurricane Sandy and efforts to recover and rebuild neighbourhoods, which invited people to submit their post-hurricane stories digitally. Getting city officials to support creative projects that help shape communities can pose challenges. Coders may interact mainly with IT departments in the city, but socially engaged artists often partner with cultural divisions or bypass officials altogether and opt for guerrilla tactics. One of the greatest opportunities offered by artists and coders working together on projects is that many civically-engaged artists push a more radical theory of social change. Coders who are involved in &quot;civic tech&quot; or &quot;gov 2.0&quot; largely aim for a non-partisan position. While this can be useful when negotiating the daily mechanisms of city government, civic apps and open data initiatives that lack an ideological mooring can sometimes lead to harmful policies that increase inequality. Support from cities \u2013 whether it is economic, or a streamlined approval process \u2013 remains important in projects led by artists or civic activists. In Walk Raleigh, North Carolina, officials deemed guerrilla wayfinding signs mere graffiti but the city&apos;s planning director, Mitchell Silver, and his staff pushed back. &quot;We have not seen this level of this civic participation in my lifetime,&quot; he told the Atlantic Cities, &quot; \u2026and we don&apos;t want to discourage that level of creativity.&quot; Two projects undertaken by San Francisco&apos;s office of Civic Innovation demonstrate the positive role that cities can play. The Urban Prototyping Festival and Living Innovation Zones are two examples where the city, in partnership with charities such as the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts (GAFFTA) and the Exploratorium, have worked with artists and technologists to create interactive public art installations with unprecedented speed. The Urban Prototyping Festival, held in San Francisco and Singapore, involved the staging of pop-up art and technology installations on city blocks. Organized by GAFFTA in collaboration with the city, the festival demonstrated a number of ways to address civic issues such as poverty and crime creatively. The Living Innovation Zone (LIZ) programme grew out of the festival, spearheaded by Shannon Spanhake, deputy innovation officer for the city and county of San Francisco, and Jake Levitas, a designer and community activist based in the city. The programme encourages and offers resources for &quot;urban infrastructure &apos;hacks&apos;&quot; that help to look again at public spaces and the challenges through the arts and technology. The city provides access and resources, enabling meaningful participation between local artists and technology workers. There is a clear increase in civic engagement among younger demographic groups. While artists have pushed for social change for centuries, technology professionals are a relatively new, and at times na\u00efve, entrant to civic engagement efforts. What we need is a genuine effort to put aside preconceptions and ideological critiques, and pool our skills and resources on projects that connect us to our communities and address their most pressing needs. \u2022 Want your say?

First was the release of Michael Lewis&apos;s explosive new book, Flash Boys: Cracking the Money Code, which highlights many worrying practices in a sector that accounts for about half of all trades on the New York and London stock exchanges. Second was the FBI&apos;s announcement on 2 April that it would begin a criminal investigation into wrongdoing in the sector. During 18 years with JP Morgan and for more than a decade since, I have watched and participated in the inexorable transformation of the markets, enabled by advances in technology. Their primary role of raising capital, allocating resources efficiently and mitigating risk has been slowly but surely drowned out by a cacophony of frenetic speculation. The capital markets are no longer the means to serve the capital allocation needs of the real economy, but have become ends in themselves. That end is the &quot;business&quot; of speculation, which is way out of balance and therefore unhealthy for the real economy. As initially designed and utilised, derivative contracts connected domestic capital markets into a more efficient, interconnected global market for the benefit of borrowers, investors and intermediaries alike. They were also used for genuine risk management purposes, where, for example, a trucking company buys a petroleum hedge to ensure its operating costs are predictable. But they have become a tool of choice for aggressive mega-scale speculators. Nowhere has technology had a greater impact on finance than in the rise of algorithmic trading, known as high-frequency trading. Initially, computer-driven algorithms enhanced the efficiency of human traders and so enhanced liquidity, thereby reducing costs of buying and selling. Over time, these same quantitative trading strategies became centres of speculative proprietary trading themselves, at times quite predatory in nature. Their dominance has already led to &quot;flash crashes&quot; such as the one in May 2010 when the Dow Jones index dropped 9% in a matter of minutes wiping billions off the value of companies. While algorithm-driven trading has many legitimate applications, high-frequency trading is, at its worst, systematic front-running of order flow. We call that theft. No wonder the FBI is investigating. Systems scientists understand that, in any given system, there is a need to balance system efficiency (resulting in high throughput) with system resilience (resulting in an ability to withstand shocks). Yet in the case of financial markets, the balance has tipped too far in favour of speed and perceived efficiency, leaving markets highly brittle and more susceptible to collapse. High degrees of financial leverage compound this, leaving them vulnerable to events like the 2008 financial crisis and the numerous mini-crashes that have occurred since and are continuing. There is a counter-argument that increasing transaction volume is good since it helps markets respond to and absorb shocks. But this confuses volume with liquidity. The former vanishes in times of crisis as speculators turn their algorithms off and pull their (faux) liquidity out of the market. It is little more than a mirage. This can trigger a cascading effect as real money investors pull back in self-defence and at times flee in panic. Suddenly, markets are empty of true liquidity at the time it&apos;s needed most. That is why I am a supporter of policy that itself is making headlines at the moment \u2013 the financial transaction tax or Tobin tax, consistent with the initiative of the 11 European countries implementing the proposed FTT of between 0.01%-0.1% on trades in stocks, bonds and derivatives. The tax falls disproportionately on short-term speculation, such as the worst of high-frequency trading, and probably eliminates it much more effectively than complex layers of new regulation. It will, as James Tobin put it 40 years ago when he proposed the FTT, throw &quot;sand in the wheels&quot; of international trading markets, encouraging market participants to shift towards longer-term genuine investment strategies where the tax consequences will be inconsequential. If the FTT causes a shift that even modestly reduces the fragility of markets and the risk of deepened future crises \u2013 both highly detrimental to the long-run efficiency of the real economy, which is the efficiency that really matters \u2013 it will have been worth it. If, in the process, the FTT encourages a few &quot;rocket-scientists&quot; to apply their creative talents to a purpose more productive for society than speculating, so much the better. And we can certainly find good uses for the incremental revenues, measured in the tens of billions. The 11 European countries implementing the FTT will not be setting a precedent. Numerous countries, including those with deep and fast-growing markets, such as Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa, India and Switzerland, have FTTs that raise their governments billions in revenue every year. The world&apos;s two largest financial centres that remain opposed to the European FTT \u2013 the US and Britain \u2013 already have small FTTs of their own, although you never hear them acknowledge it. There is seldom, if ever, a word about problems to the real economy or even the capital markets caused by the existing well-functioning transaction taxes because they are virtually invisible, seamlessly integrated into trading systems and investment practices. They should, however, be applied evenly to all trading instruments. As a former banker, I fully appreciate that the FTT is not, as some hope, a miracle cure that will address all the wrongs of Wall Street. Only structural reform of the kind Teddy Roosevelt understood can accomplish that. But it is a proven revenue raiser and a laser-sharp policy intervention that helps combat the negative effect on the wider economy by a financial sector ridden by corrosive speculation. John Maynard Keynes, a speculator himself, perhaps said it best: &quot;Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes the by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.&quot; A lesson we ignore at our peril."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/apr/04/drug-excessive-bleeding-after-childbirth-save-lives", "sentences": ["The clinical study, which will be conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO), will include about 29,000 women in Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, the UK and Uganda."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T12:01:00Z", "title": "Drug to prevent excessive bleeding after childbirth could save thousands of lives", "tags": ["Maternal health", "Maternal mortality", "Global development", "Women", "Health", "Childbirth", "Health & wellbeing", "Life and style", "Science"], "article": "The trial of a new drug to prevent excessive bleeding in women after childbirth, which could potentially save thousands of lives annually, is to begin in 12 countries in June. The clinical study, which will be conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO), will include about 29,000 women in Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, South Africa, Thailand, the UK and Uganda. The trial, which is expected to last 18 months, will test the effectiveness of a new medicine developed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, which can be stored at room temperature in hot and tropical locations. Oxytocin, the drug most commonly used to prevent bleeding after childbirth, requires refrigeration, which is a major obstacle for health centres in countries with unreliable energy supplies. The problem is particularly acute in poorer countries, which may lack not only cold storage facilities but also decent roads, making journeys to more remote areas significantly slower, particularly during rainy seasons. According to the WHO, postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of death during childbirth, killing about 130,000 women worldwide each year. The millennium development goal of a 75% reduction in maternal deaths by 2015 is among the most off-track of the eight global targets, and is unlikely to be met in the majority of poorer countries. However, all regions have made gains in cutting rates. According to the UN, the ratio of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births fell from 400 to 210 between 1990 and 2010. If the WHO trial is successful, the agency will collaborate with Ferring and the pharmaceutical company Merck to explore how to make the medicine cheaply available to poorer countries. Michel Pettigrew, president of Ferring&apos;s executive board, said he wanted the drug to be as cheap as possible. A vial of oxytocin costs about \u00a31; Pettigrew hoped the new formula would not cost much more. &quot;For many years, one of the concerns expressed to us by our medical committee was how we don&apos;t have a climate-sensitive product, which would be easier to keep. So we started looking into this two and a half years ago, and were able to develop a formulation which would be acceptable for these temperatures,&quot; he said. &quot;We thought, let&apos;s make sure we try to make a product at a very low cost to make it available at a very low price to low-resource countries. That way, at least we&apos;ve done our part to help women get through pregnancy and live a normal life afterwards with their children. &quot;We believe we have developed a drug which can save lives. We are not a big pharmaceutical company, we&apos;re privately owned, so the financial motivation [for us] is very different. The commitment from shareholders is [that] we should help people around the world.&quot; Kenneth Frazier, chairman and chief executive at Merck, said: &quot;Working with our partners, we can help make a better solution a reality. It would be a real breakthrough to prevent the number one cause of women dying in childbirth in the most vulnerable parts of the globe.&quot; Through its Merck for Mothers initiative, the company has committed $500m (\u00a3300m) over 10 years to find ways to reduce maternal mortality."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/04/why-all-love-numbers-mathematics", "sentences": ["In 2011, Dan King of the National University of Singapore and Chris Janiszewski of the University of Florida demonstrated that an imaginary brand of anti-dandruff shampoo was better liked when it was called Zinc 24 than when it was called Zinc 31."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T14:00:00Z", "title": "Why we all love numbers", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Mathematics", "Science", "Mathematics", "Education", "Autism", "Society"], "article": "Jerry Newport asks me to pick a four-digit number. &quot;2761,&quot; I say. &quot;That&apos;s 11\u00a0x 251,&quot; he\u00a0replies, reciting the numbers in one continuous, unhesitant flow. &quot;2762.

He has a ruddy complexion and small blue eyes, his large forehead sliced by a diagonal comb of dark-blond hair. He likes birds as well as numbers, and when we meet he is wearing a\u00a0flowery red shirt with a parrot on it.\u00a0We are sitting in his living room, together with a cockatoo, a dove, three parakeets and two cockatiels, which were listening to, and occasionally repeating, our conversation. As soon as Jerry sees a big number, he divides it up into prime numbers. This habit made his former job driving cabs particularly enjoyable, since there was always a number on the licence plate in front of him. When he lived in Santa Monica, where licence numbers were four and five digits long, he would often visit the four-storey car park of his local mall and not leave until he had worked through every plate. In Tucson, however, car numbers are only three digits long. He barely glances at them now. &quot;If the number is more than four digits I&apos;ll start to pay attention to it. If\u00a0it&apos;s four digits or less, it&apos;s roadkill. It\u00a0is!&quot; he remonstrates. &quot;Come on! Show me something new!&quot; Asperger&apos;s is a psychological disorder in which social awkwardness can coexist with extreme abilities, such as, in\u00a0Jerry&apos;s case, an extraordinary talent for mental arithmetic. In 2010, he competed at the Mental Calculation World Cup in Germany having done no\u00a0preparation. He won the overall title of most versatile calculator, the only contestant to score full marks in the category where 19 five-digit numbers have to be decomposed into their constituent primes in 10 minutes. No\u00a0one else even got close. Jerry&apos;s system for breaking down large numbers is to sieve out the prime numbers in ascending order, extracting a 2 if the number is even, extracting a 3 if it divides by three, a 5 if it divides by five and so on. He raises his voice to a\u00a0yell: &quot;Oh yeah, we&apos;re sievin&apos;, baby! Yeah! Jerry and the sievers!&quot; His wife, Mary, who is sitting on the sofa next to us, a musician and former Star Trek extra, also has Asperger&apos;s, which is much less common in women than it is in men. A marriage between two people with Asperger&apos;s is rare, and\u00a0their unconventional romance was\u00a0turned into the 2005 Hollywood film Mozart and the Whale. Sometimes Jerry cannot extract any\u00a0primes from a large number, which means the number is itself prime. When this happens it gives him a thrill: &quot;If it&apos;s a prime number I&apos;ve never found before, it&apos;s kinda like if you were looking for rocks, and you&apos;ve found a\u00a0new rock, something like a diamond you can take home and put on your shelf.&quot; He pauses. &quot;A new prime number \u2013 it&apos;s\u00a0like having a new friend.&quot; The earliest words and symbols used for numbers date from about 5,000 years ago in Sumer, a region in what is now Iraq. The Sumerians did not look far when coming up with names. The word for one, ges, also meant man, or erect phallus. The word for two, min, also meant woman, symbolic of the male being primary and the woman his\u00a0complement, or perhaps describing a\u00a0penis and a pair of breasts. Initially, numbers served a practical purpose, such as counting sheep and\u00a0calculating taxes. Yet they also revealed abstract patterns, which made them objects of contemplation. Perhaps the earliest mathematical discovery was that numbers come in two types: even \u2013 those that can be halved cleanly, such as 2, 4 and 6 \u2013 and\u00a0odd \u2013 those that cannot, such as 1, 3 and 5. Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century BC, echoed the Sumerian association of one with man and two\u00a0with woman by proclaiming odd\u00a0numbers masculine and even numbers\u00a0feminine.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video Resistance to splitting in two, he argued, embodied strength, while susceptibility to splitting in two was a\u00a0weakness. He gave a further arithmetical justification: odd was master over even, just as man is master over woman, because when you add an odd\u00a0number to an even number, the answer remains odd. Pythagoras is most famous for his theorem about triangles, but his belief about number gender has dominated western thought for more than 2,000 years. Christianity embraced it within its creation myth: God created Adam first and Eve second. One signifies unity, and two is the &quot;sin which deviates from the First Good&quot;. For the medieval church, odd numbers were stronger, better, more godly and luckier than even, and by Shakespeare&apos;s time, metaphysical beliefs about odd numbers were common: &quot;They say there is divinity in odd numbers, either in nativity, chance or death,&quot; Falstaff declares in The Merry Wives of Windsor. These superstitions remain. Mystical numbers still tend to be odd, notably the &quot;magic&quot; three, the &quot;lucky&quot; seven and the &quot;unlucky&quot; 13. Shakespeare is also responsible for the modern meaning of &quot;odd&quot;. Originally, the word only had a numerical sense. It was used in phrases such as &quot;odd man out&quot;, the unpaired member of a group of three. But in Love&apos;s Labour&apos;s Lost, the farcical Spaniard Don Adriano de Armado is described as\u00a0&quot;too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it were&quot;. &quot;Odd&quot; has meant &quot;peculiar&quot; ever since. It is human nature to be sensitive to\u00a0numerical patterns. These patterns provoke subjective responses, sometimes extreme ones, as we saw with Jerry, but also more generally, leading to deeply held cultural associations. Researchers James Wilkie and Galen Bodenhausen decided to\u00a0investigate whether there was any psychological basis to the ancient belief that odds are\u00a0male and evens are\u00a0female. They showed respondents randomly assigned pictures of the faces of young babies, each next to a\u00a0three-digit number that was either odd-odd-odd or even-even-even, and asked them to guess the baby&apos;s sex. This experiment sounds absurd, and it would have been forgotten had it not achieved a striking result: the choice of\u00a0number had a significant effect. Respondents were about 10% more likely to say that a baby paired with odd numbers was a boy, than if the same baby was paired with even numbers. Wilkie and Bodenhausen concluded that the Pythagoreans, medieval Christians and Taoists were right. The ancient, cross-cultural belief that odds are associated with maleness and evens with femaleness was supported by the\u00a0data. They were unable to explain, however, why odd is masculine and even is feminine, rather than vice versa. Culture, language and psychology play a role in the way we understand mathematical patterns; numbers have a fixed mathematical meaning \u2013 they are abstract entities signifying quantity and order \u2013 yet they also tell other stories. The influential German theologian Hugh of Saint Victor (1096\u20131141) provided an early guide to numbers: 10 represents &quot;rectitude in faith&quot;, nine, coming before 10, &quot;defect among perfection&quot;, and 11, coming afterwards, &quot;transgression outside of measure&quot;. If\u00a0Hugh were alive today he would undoubtedly find lucrative employment at the Semiotic Alliance. I\u00a0met its founder, Greg Rowland, in London. Greg advises multinational companies on the symbolism of their brands, which involves the cultural associations of numbers. His clients include Unilever, Calvin Klein and KFC. The number 11, for example, is an essential element of KFC&apos;s corporate mythology: its signature dish is fried chicken seasoned with Colonel Sanders&apos;s secret original recipe of 11 herbs and spices. &quot;This is the key mystical use of the number 11 in commercial culture,&quot; says Greg. The number represents transgression, he adds, in this case an extra ingredient, one beyond the ordinary. &quot;Eleven has just gone that one past 10. It has recognised that there is an order to things, and now it is exploring the distance beyond. Eleven is opening the door to the infinite, but it&apos;s not going too far. It is \u2026 rebellion at its most finite.&quot; I ask if Colonel Sanders was therefore no different from the rocker in Spinal Tap whose amp went up to\u00a011\u00a0so it could be louder than amps labelled to 10. Greg laughs: &quot;Yes!\u00a0But I\u00a0actually believe it. I believe that 11 is\u00a0more interesting than 10.&quot; The Spinal Tap-style extra 1, he adds, is a common meme. A classic example is Levi&apos;s 501 jeans. &quot;This raises the expectation but doesn&apos;t overplay it. It&apos;s\u00a0that extra little bit, and\u00a0that is\u00a0what Levi&apos;s is always doing, or\u00a0in its\u00a0glory days always did: adding an extra little button here or a new piece of sewing there. And it works well with\u00a0the big decimals: the film 2001: A\u00a0Space Odyssey, the 101 drum machine, Room\u00a0101. It wasn&apos;t Room 100 \u2013 who&apos;d be scared of that?&quot;            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view video The significance of the extra 1 is an established part of\u00a0Indian culture. Shagun is the custom of giving a\u00a0round sum of money as a gift, with one rupee added. Gift envelopes in wedding shops, for example, come with a one rupee coin glued to them, so you don&apos;t\u00a0forget it. While there is no single explanation for the practice \u2013 some say\u00a0the one is a blessing, others that it represents the beginning of a new cycle \u2013 it is accepted that the symbolic value of the extra one is as important as the monetary value of the notes inside. In business, as in religion, a\u00a0good number is fundamental. The number 10 \u2013 &quot;rectitude in faith&quot; \u2013 strengthens faith in the anti\u2011acne cream Oxy 10: &quot;Ten is about balance, security, returning to the norm. It&apos;s the absolute decimal,&quot; says Greg. &quot;There is no argument with 10.&quot; I\u00a0asked him if he thought the all-purpose lubricant WD-40 would have been as successful if it had been called WD-41. &quot;WD-41 would not be reliable,&quot; he insisted. &quot;WD-41 would have more stuff in it than you would want. WD-40 is not over-claiming. It\u00a0is\u00a0a simple, humble enhancement.&quot; (According to company legend, the brand owes its name to the chemist Norm Larsen. He was trying to invent a\u00a0liquid that would prevent corrosion, hence &quot;Water Displacement&quot; in the name. WD-40 was his 40th attempt.) Academic research corroborates Greg&apos;s semiotic evaluation: for household products, divisible numbers are more attractive to consumers than indivisible ones. In 2011, Dan King of the National University of Singapore and Chris Janiszewski of the University of Florida demonstrated that an imaginary brand of anti-dandruff shampoo was better liked when it was called Zinc 24 than when it was called Zinc 31. The respondents preferred Zinc 24 so much that they were willing to pay 10% more for it. King and Janiszewski argued that customers prefer 24 because they are more familiar with the number from their schooldays, when the lines 3 x 8 = 24 and 4 x 6 = 24\u00a0were drummed into them by rote. By comparison, 31 is a\u00a0prime number and does not appear in\u00a0any school multiplication table. Greg was not surprised at the results, but he\u00a0had a\u00a0different take: &quot;Zinc 24 fits our sense that even-numbered products bring us back to a sense of normalcy, to a sense of things as they should be,&quot; he\u00a0says. &quot;Odd numbers provide extra room for a bit of emotional negotiation, which is why there is more mysticism around them.&quot; And why, he added, we don&apos;t want them in our hair. To reinforce their hypothesis that processing fluency increases brand preference, King and Janiszewski designed a follow-up experiment that subtly included a multiplication sum in\u00a0the advertisement for a numbered brand. They first decided on the products, Solus 36 and Solus 37, two fictitious lines of the real contact lens brand Solus. They then created four ads: one for Solus 36, one for Solus 37 and one for each product with the tag\u00a0line &quot;6 colours. 6 fits&quot;. When there\u00a0was\u00a0no tag line, the participants preferred Solus 36 over Solus 37, as\u00a0would be expected. But when the\u00a0researchers included the tag line, Solus\u00a036 increased in popularity and Solus 37 became even less popular. King and Janiszewski argued that our familiarity with 6, 6 and 36, from the six times table sum 6 x 6 = 36, increases our fluency in processing the numbers, just as the unfamiliarity of 6, 6 and 37, which are not arithmetically related, decreases it. The pleasure rush that comes from subconsciously recognising a simple multiplication makes us feel good, they said, and we misattribute the buzz as satisfaction with the product. We are always sensitive to whether a\u00a0number is divisible or not, and this sensitivity influences our behaviour. We are all a bit like Jerry Newport, the taxi driver from Tucson, who cannot see a number without dividing it up into primes. Another response to\u00a0numbers is affection. I had not realised the depth of our collective number love until I conducted an online experiment asking members of the public to nominate their favourite numbers and\u00a0explain their choices. More than 30,000 people took part in the first few\u00a0weeks. Here is\u00a0an idea of the words\u00a0they used. Number one: independent, strong, honest, brave, straightforward, pioneering, lonely. Two: cautious, wise, pretty, fragile, open, sympathetic, quiet, clean, flexible. Three: dynamic, warm, friendly, extrovert, opulent, soft, relaxed, pretentious. Four: laid-back, rogue, solid, reliable, versatile, down-to-earth, personable. Five: balanced, central, cute, fat, dominant but not too\u00a0much so, happy. Six: upbeat, sexy, supple, soft, strong, brave, genuine, courageous, humble. Seven: magical, unalterable, intelligent, awkward, overconfident, masculine. King and Janiszewski conducted an experiment in which the participants indicated whether they liked, disliked or felt neutral about every number from 1 to 100. The results showed that our liking of numbers follows clear patterns. Most striking, however, was the unpopularity of numbers ending in\u00a01, 3, 7 and 9. When I saw the results, I\u00a0instantly thought of Jerry and realised we all sieve prime numbers. The primes are significant features of\u00a0our internal landscape of numbers, not just\u00a0for savants like Jerry, but for the rest of us, too. Our brains are always switched\u00a0on to arithmetic. \u2022 Alex Bellos&apos;s Alex Through the Looking-Glass: How Life Reflects Numbers and Numbers Reflect Life is out from Bloomsbury on 10 April."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/kigali-plan-rwandan-city-afford-new-homes-offices", "sentences": ["When you dive into a pool, you don&apos;t aim for very close to the side, [but] try and get as far as you can go and then see where you end up.&quot; Supporters say the plans, designed by Oz Architects and developed by Surbana, an urban planning consortium based in Singapore, fit with President Paul Kagame&apos;s ambition to drive Rwanda&apos;s economy forwards."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T15:41:42Z", "title": "Kigali's future or costly fantasy? Plan to reshape Rwandan city divides opinion", "tags": ["Global development", "Rwanda", "Africa", "World news", "Cities"], "article": "It has been conceived as one of the continent&apos;s most ambitious urban planning projects: a city of gleaming high-rise towers, arching pedestrian walkways, green spaces, fountains and an effective public transport system. The reimagined Kigali will be decentralised, with satellite towns, business, leisure and shopping districts, as well as a wetlands conservation area. Twenty years after Rwandan capital was decimated by 100 days of killing, its population of 1.22 million is now expected to triple by 2040. The development plan has won international awards, but detractors argue that at best the vision is beautifully unrealistic, and at worst a work of fantasy that fails to take into account the demographic and economic challenges facing the east African country. &quot;Who are these buildings for, tourists, the creme de la creme of society?&quot; asks one of the city&apos;s intellectuals, who requests not to be named. &quot;Fine, but we ask: where are normal people going to sleep tonight?&quot; In Kigali&apos;s &quot;one-stop centre&quot; for construction, on the ninth floor of the glass-and-steel Grand Pension Plaza, architects&apos; impressions of the future cover the walls. From here it is possible to see half a dozen building projects already under way. Liliane Mupende, the director of urban planning and construction, takes pains to point them out, noting that some are financed by Rwandan investors and others by foreigners.     The centre of the Rwandan capital, Kigali. Photograph: Phil Moore/AFP/Getty Images    While the flashy promotional videos don&apos;t dwell on where Kigali&apos;s mainly low-earning residents will live, possible solutions for affordable housing are quietly on show in the office. &quot;Creating affordable housing is one of our greatest challenges,&quot; admits Mupende. By demolishing informal housing - an estimated 70% of all dwellings in the capital - and creating more high-density areas, the city is &quot;getting itself organised so future generations don&apos;t face what we are facing now&quot;, she says. Rent-to-own schemes are being considered and the government will enforce regulations that set quotas of affordable building for any purchased land. Despite empty patches of land, and half-filled new office blocks in which many find space too expensive to rent, Mupende insists the scheme is realistic and workable. &quot;We are trying to establish how we can best use our limited resources to provide for future generations,&quot; she says. &quot;It is a long-term plan. Yes, it is bold, but you have to be bold to achieve anything of note. When you dive into a pool, you don&apos;t aim for very close to the side, [but] try and get as far as you can go and then see where you end up.&quot; Supporters say the plans, designed by Oz Architects and developed by Surbana, an urban planning consortium based in Singapore, fit with President Paul Kagame&apos;s ambition to drive Rwanda&apos;s economy forwards. In 2012 Rwanda jumped to 52nd on the World Bank&apos;s &quot;ease of doing business&quot; rankings, from 158th in 2005, after Kagame set up a special unit to analyse and crack its ratings system. That ambition has a darker side too: Kagame has been accused of locking up street hawkers and beggars to keep Kigali&apos;s streets clean. When the New York Times alleged that street children had been rounded up and placed in a detention centre on the island of Iwawa on the remote Lake Kivu, the government responded by saying Iwawa was &quot;a vocational training centre, and it has not only taught the youth life-changing skills but also helped them get off drugs&quot;. It said students could be seen &quot;singing, dancing, chanting and showing off their new hard-earned skills&quot; at graduation ceremonies. As part of the development, many businesses in the boisterous downtown shopping district have been boarded up, and nearby shopkeepers know they are next. &quot;Development is good but to change the situation of a country is not a small thing, we have to go step by step \u2013 but this is very, very quick,&quot; says Celestin Pierre Munyendamutsa, 32, behind the counter of his small kiosk that sells paper and ink cartridges. &quot;For me, that isn&apos;t easy, it means we have to go and find somewhere else to do business.&quot; Another shopkeeper, who did not want to give his name, said he paid around 400,000 francs (\u00a3355) a month in rent, but in the new glittering mall next door he would have to pay 1m francs (around \u00a3880). &quot;That&apos;s not good business,&quot; he says. Asked where he will go when the time comes, he gives a bark of a laugh. &quot;What do you want me to do? I will go home to sleep.&quot;     Construction workers at the site of the new Kigali Conference Centre. Photograph: Phil Moore/AFP/Getty Images    Guillaume Sardin, a French architect and co-founder of the George Pericles thinktank, who works in the city, says the Kigali masterplan is a smart piece of branding. &quot;It is a very clever way of putting yourself on the map, of saying: &apos;Yes you may remember us for one thing, but we can also be something else.&apos; The plans are beautiful, but the problem is the implementation \u2013 there is a gap between the perception and the reality. But the positive news is the city is listening.&quot; A new middle class is emerging, which includes members of the diaspora such as Matthew Rugamba, who started his own House of Tayo fashion brand after studying in the US. &quot;I was fed up of seeing the pity in people&apos;s eyes when I told them I was Rwandan,&quot; he says. &quot;So I decided to create something, so I could change perceptions.&quot; Building of new homes has started in Kigali suburbs that are little more than villages perched on the edge of red-dirt roads. In Kinyinya, about a 20-minute taxi moto ride from the centre, a new apartment block with glass sliding doors leading out on to balconies is nearly finished. Here a two-bed apartment will cost in the region of \u00a380,000 \u2013 in the 25th poorest country in the world, where 45% of the population live in poverty. The block is moments away from a vibrant little town centre where music blares out of laptop speakers and people haggle over fresh produce and admire the new trainers for sale on a show stall. Elias Dusable, 31, a taxi moto driver who rents a small house with no running water for about 25,000 francs (\u00a322) a month, says he is relaxed about the new homes. &quot;If my country is developing and beautiful then I have no problem with that,&quot; he says. &quot;These are homes for rich people, but their riches came from God. So maybe one day I will be that rich too.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/04/sebastian-vettel-f1-bahrain-lights-engines", "sentences": ["The Gulf kingdom&apos;s desert is no match for Singapore&apos;s prismatic skyline in F1&apos;s already established night race but Bahrain&apos;s 10th GP will be an altogether more colourful affair than those that have preceded it."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T18:13:12Z", "title": "Sebastian Vettel's F1 gripes do not take shine off Bahrain bright lights", "tags": ["Formula One 2014", "Jenson Button", "Lewis Hamilton", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "It was not protesters&apos; bombs or firecrackers that illuminated the Bahrain International Circuit on Friday night but an eye-dazzling array of floodlights that promise to make Sunday&apos;s grand prix one of the most spectacular on the Formula One agenda. &quot;Oh my God it&apos;s bright,&quot; Jenson Button said after practising under the coruscating illumination of 5,000 lightbulbs. &quot;It&apos;s going to be pretty cool. You&apos;re going to enjoy it.&quot; Cool in more ways than one, for the lower temperature will be kinder to drivers and tyres alike. The Gulf kingdom&apos;s desert is no match for Singapore&apos;s prismatic skyline in F1&apos;s already established night race but Bahrain&apos;s 10th GP will be an altogether more colourful affair than those that have preceded it. The general poor attendance for this race should also be up, given that it will take place after working hours. &quot;For the fans it&apos;s good, because they can see the bright lights and the flames out of the exhaust, if we burn some fuel,&quot; said Button, whose McLaren is still short of downforce. &quot;We turned the lights on in testing [in February]. They&apos;re pretty bright \u2013 and in the corners there are some bright lights for the TV. &quot;But for the drivers it&apos;s the steering wheel that affects you. The rev lights are unbelievably bright especially if you&apos;ve got a few tear-offs on because you see them four or five times. We&apos;re trying to work out how we can turn those lights down.&quot; There was a nice line in this week&apos;s Economist which, alluding to the country&apos;s poor human rights record, and under the headline &quot;The Dark Affair&quot;, said that the race &quot;would take place under the cover of darkness&quot;. Figuratively, perhaps, but not literally. Lewis Hamilton said: &quot;The lights are great. They&apos;ve done a fantastic job with the circuit. It looks even better at night. I&apos;ve not really noticed any issues, no black spots. The visibility is perfect.&quot; Hamilton and Mercedes, however, need no help to shine. Hamilton dominated both Friday afternoon&apos;s and the night&apos;s practice sessions, pushing his team-mate Nico Rosberg down to second place on each occasion, with Fernando Alonso third both times. The frightening thing for those who seek to hunt Hamilton down is that he says he is still experimenting with his car. Mercedes have the best car and are likely to enjoy that advantage at least until the jamboree comes to Europe in May. But the car has also transformed Hamilton&apos;s attitude. This week Hamilton agreed with his former team-mate Button&apos;s description of him as &quot;superfast but up and down emotionally&quot;. Hamilton added on Friday: &quot;The difference for me is that I find myself this season with a car knowing I can fight the other guys, and it&apos;s a great feeling. Today&apos;s been a pretty decent day. I loved driving today, and the car feels better now than it did when we were here testing. I&apos;ve a much better feel of where I need to put the car so I&apos;m very happy with the practice sessions. But it&apos;s still going to be tough, particularly with the temperatures dropping all the time.&quot; Meanwhile, the FIA president, Jean Todt, will speak to Sebastian Vettel this weekend following the driver&apos;s description of the new engines as &quot;shit&quot;. The new 1.6-litre hybrid engine is very much Todt&apos;s baby and it is understood that he is upset, having emerged from a period of complicated confinement, to hear his sprog being dismissed in such a way. Todt wrote to Vettel earlier in the week and suggested a meeting in Bahrain. In the letter, it is understood that he respected Vettel&apos;s right to voice an opinion but expressed his displeasure with the Red Bull driver&apos;s strong language. &quot;Mr Todt is coming here, so it makes sense to use the opportunity to talk about many things,&quot; said the German, a little airily. &quot;It&apos;s fairly normal to have a meeting after a couple of races.&quot; Vettel&apos;s comments were defended by the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, who said: &quot;All the drivers are allowed to express their own opinion. Sebastian has expressed his opinion and I don&apos;t think anybody would condemn a driver for doing that. His opinion is not one that he is alone on. There are differences of opinion and everybody is entitled to one.&quot;Pat Symonds, technical director at Williams, warned F1 it must not repeat the mistake of the jeweller Gerald Ratner who derided his own products. McLaren, who are still searching for a title sponsor, are having talks with Japan&apos;s biggest internet retailer Rakuten, the owners of Play.com, according to Sky News, who report that an annual sum of \u00a340m for three years is being discussed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/06/room-at-top-londons-super-prime-housing-market", "sentences": ["Investors flock to property shows in Moscow, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Singapore, snapping up houses off-plan, in cash."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-06T05:30:00Z", "title": "Room at the top: London's super-prime housing market", "tags": ["Housing", "Housing market", "Real estate", "Society", "Architecture", "Business", "London", "Lakshmi Mittal", "Roman Abramovich", "World news"], "article": "Where Hampstead Heath meets Highgate Hill, behind steep red-brick walls, there is a garden. In the garden, hidden by a protective coppice of tall trees, there is a house. If we were to step through the heavily boarded gates, edge past the 24-hour security, and through those trees, we&apos;d find the shell of a mansion on whose lawns George VI played tennis; in the 1940s Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret sipped tea on the parterre. Witanhurst is the second largest private residence in London, narrowly beaten by Buckingham Palace. Currently undergoing a \u00a350m redevelopment, the 95,000 sq ft property, when finished, will boast 25 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, a cavernous underground leisure complex including a 70ft swimming pool and two-tiered cinema, all set within five-and-a-half acres of ornamental\u00a0gardens. The Highgate Society \u2013 a residents&apos; association \u2013 is campaigning against the project, and the size and scale of the works seems out of place in an area of London that has always felt more like a village. There is a problem facing protesters, though: nobody is quite sure who owns the building. The story of Witanhurst is emblematic of the obfuscation and skulduggery surrounding high-end property in London, a city whose housing market has become the asset class of choice for the world&apos;s skittish\u00a0billionaires. Witanhurst had fallen into a state of crumbling disrepair under the ownership of an absentee Middle Eastern family when it was bought by property developer Marcus Cooper for \u00a332m in 2007. Cooper almost immediately put the place back on the market for \u00a375m, finally accepting \u00a350m in 2008. The purchaser was a British Virgin Islands-based entity, Safran Holdings, the vehicle for anonymous eastern European buyers. Plans were filed for the Babylonian excesses currently nearing completion in N6. Cranes went up, massive lorries started chuntering around the heath, a vast orangery began to poke its dome above the treetops. But still the owners remain hidden behind their labyrinthine tax-avoidance schemes. Apparently not even Robert Adam, the architect in charge of the project, knows his clients&apos; identity, with all negotiations handled by intermediaries and advisers. For all the internet speculation \u2013 there is a section devoted to Witanhurst on David Icke&apos;s website \u2013 we are no closer to knowing the owners of this most elephantine of white elephants. Witanhurst is an extreme example of the way overseas money is radically altering London&apos;s landscape \u2013 both its physical appearance and the shape and structure of the lives of everyday people. The inflation of the property market has unmoored the city from the rest of the country, with a combination of rampant speculation and a lack of supply pushing valuations into the stratosphere. Already in the capital&apos;s swankier boroughs \u2013 Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster \u2013 average prices have broken through the \u00a31m mark, with Camden, Hammersmith and Fulham and the City not far behind.           In 2013, 85% of new houses in London were sold to non-UK buyers, with investors from east Asia driving demand. Foreign money dominates the top end of the market, with almost half of all homes over \u00a31m bought by non-UK residents. Investors flock to property shows in Moscow, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Singapore, snapping up houses off-plan, in cash. The majority of foreign investors either rent out the homes they purchase, or &quot;buy to leave&quot; \u2013 allowing the properties to stand empty and relying on the inexorable rise of the London market to deliver returns. It was the resilience of house prices during the 2008 crash that lent London property its aura of gilt-edged invulnerability. Where once investors would have bought safe-haven assets like gold and bonds in times of turmoil, now they buy bricks and mortar. With Swiss banks \u2013 smarting after the financial crisis \u2013 less willing to fulfil their traditional role of no-questions-asked banking for the world&apos;s super-rich, London&apos;s high-end property has come to fill that gap in the market, cheered on by a grateful government. The luxury apartments of south-west London, the empty mansions of Notting Hill and Hampstead have become lavishly upholstered safety deposit boxes, stucco-fronted bank vaults. Last weekend, I took a drive through the city at night. I came down Park Lane just after nine, edging around the Lamborghini Murci\u00e9lagos parked up outside the Dorchester, then through the tree-hushed squares of Belgravia and into Knightsbridge. The rusty hulk of One Hyde Park, the Candy brothers&apos; monolithic apartment block, lowered over me, every window black; I sidled past the Knightsbridge Apartments \u2013 a development favoured by Russians where pieds-\u00e0-terre go for \u00a35m and up \u2013 and through Trevor Square to Brompton Road. I counted lit windows on the fingers of one hand. It was as if I was driving through some apocalyptic vision of a city snuffed of all life, of all light. It is striking that in a recent survey of the UK&apos;s empty homes, Kensington and Chelsea sits alongside poverty-stricken boroughs in the north-west, with a 40% rise in unoccupied houses in the past year alone. Here, though, it is not a matter of economic destitution, rather that the international jet setters never intended to live in their gilded crash pads, or that their Embraers touch down so rarely that they have forgotten the names of their children, their wives&apos; faces, their own many addresses. London&apos;s itinerant billionaires are a private bunch, reluctant to open up their homes to the great unwashed. So I confect a detailed cover story \u2013 a wealthy godmother looking to relocate from Paris in the wake of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s punitive tax increases. The wealthy godmother exists; her putative immigration doesn&apos;t. Wrapped in this elaborate fiction (and a smart blazer), I set off into the world of London&apos;s super-prime property market: a world of private cinemas and helicopter pads, of panic rooms and indoor golf ranges, of oceanic swimming pools and underground tennis courts. A world of status, of power and, above all else, of money, of absurd, laughable amounts of money. Address Kensington Palace Gardens, W8 Property 5-bed apartment Size 5,000 sq ft Outside space Small terrace, shared garden Price \u00a325m The first Billionaire&apos;s Row I visit \u2013 two roads in London compete for the title \u2013 is Kensington Palace Gardens, often cited as the most expensive street in the world and home to Britain&apos;s richest man, Lakshmi Mittal. Also on this leafy stretch of W8 are the Sultan of Brunei, Roman Abramovich and, at an estimated \u00a3200m, the priciest house in the country, a mansion owned by music mogul Leonard Blavatnik. I edge past a sinister, gun-toting guard peering out from the gatehouse at the Notting Hill end of the street and make my way towards a modern block of flats sitting behind heavy iron railings.     Kensington Palace Gardens. Some of the most expensive homes in London \u2013 not to say the world \u2013 are to be found here. Photograph: Andrew Holt / Alamy/Alamy    It is a glorious spring day, frothy blossom falling from the cherry trees planted in the gardens of the Japanese ambassador&apos;s residence opposite. In front of the building, I meet the estate agent from Knight Frank \u2013 the leading seller of \u00a35m-plus homes in the capital. He is unexpectedly charming. Not just the understandable charm of a man who&apos;ll make close to \u00a31m in commission if I decide to purchase the apartment we&apos;re about to view at its full \u00a325m asking price; instead there&apos;s something endearingly Glengarry Glen Ross about him, a tobacco-scented worldliness. Kensington Palace Gardens was built on land owned by the Crown Estate in the middle of the 19th century, a mixture of hefty Italianate and Queen Anne mansions initially purchased by wealthy London merchants looking to escape the bustle of the city, gentry seeking royal proximity. Even at the time of building, houses on the street were thought too large for a single owner \u2013 a Mrs Murray of Maida Vale converted No 8 into two semi-detached villas, others remained unoccupied, with architects noting that the properties were &quot;too large for the generality of families&quot;. Increasingly, the houses were turned into embassies and consulates, with the French, Israeli, Russian and Romanian embassies all taking up residence behind the stately avenue of plane trees that leads up the street&apos;s long incline. In 1937, number 12A was granted to the Nepalese for ambassadorial use in recognition of the Gurkhas&apos; service to the British army. It is only in recent years that private owners have begun to recolonise Kensington Palace Gardens. Roman Abramovich bought the former home of the Russian ambassador for \u00a390m in 2011, spending countless millions more on a subterranean extension that will include a swimming pool and underground tennis court. Lakshmi Mittal liked the houses so much that he bought one for himself, spent a further \u00a3117m on a place for his son, Aditya, and then snapped up a run-down mansion for his daughter Vanisha for \u00a370m in 2008. It is thought that the value of the three properties owned by the Mittal family on the street now tops \u00a3500m. The influx of foreign capital into London&apos;s residential property market has led to an exodus of ambassadorial buildings away from luxury postcodes. The US embassy is moving from its current location in Mayfair&apos;s Grosvenor Square to the Nine Elms development across the river in Battersea. It is thought that the Chinese will soon join them, putting their vast Portland Place property up for sale. The Nepalese embassy \u2013 notable for its state of shabby disrepair \u2013 is likely to be sold for around \u00a3100m in the coming months, with staff relocating to more modest surroundings. It is a sign of the state of the London property market that even countries can&apos;t afford to keep up with the super-rich. I am here to see a duplex flat on the ground and first floors of a sleek glass and steel building set back from the road. I&apos;m ushered up marble steps, past a porter and into the apartment, where the vendor&apos;s representative, suited and simpering, welcomes us. We step into an anonymous vestibule, gloomy behind long net curtains despite the bright day outside. Shades of brown, burgundy, dark greens. The apartment has been in the same Middle Eastern family for decades, rarely used in recent years, and there is a sense as we walk inside that we are entering a museum, a time capsule whose very air was last breathed in the 1970s. We might be on the set of Argo. I ask if I can have a wander and, floorplans in hand, set off into the dark interior. The walls of the drawing room are covered in silk toile, dotted with sombre quattrocento paintings of Florentine princes; a dark bronze sculpture of Pallas and the Centaur sits on the window ledge. Deep sofas slump beside coffee tables topped with silver-framed photographs of children in corduroy and velour. I wonder where they are, these bright-eyed youngsters now grown old. I walk to the eastern edge of the apartment where French doors give on to a large stone patio with empty troughs that must have once held flowers, fountains even. Communal lawns stretch away to high hedges, and if I lean out, I can see the red brick bulk of Kensington Palace. &quot;It may suit your godmother to have a place that is so\u2026&quot; the estate agent fishes for the right word &quot;\u2026 of an era. It means she can update to suit her own tastes.&quot; He tells me of a Russian couple who paid \u00a320m for a Kensington townhouse that was finished to an extraordinarily high standard, decided they didn&apos;t like the \u00a3150,000 kitchen, and so spent a further \u00a31m ripping it out and putting in a new one. &quot;Your godmother won&apos;t have that problem here,&quot; he says. I make my way back inside, past a study with an enormous box-like fax machine, and into a mint-green kitchen filled with the fittings and fixtures of the early 1980s \u2013 an antique microwave, a rotisserie oven, stacks of formica and Bakelite. Beside the kitchen sits a small and sad-looking maid&apos;s room, a single 10p piece \u2013 one of the large, old ones \u2013 on the bedside table. Upstairs the four bedrooms have a vaguely nautical feel, as if they were luxury suites on an ocean liner. Bathrooms boast gleaming gold taps, deep baths, vintage cosmetics on display. I wander into the master suite&apos;s walk-in wardrobe, which is so vast \u2013 endless rows of mahogany \u2013 that I begin to think I&apos;ll never emerge. It is a relief to come back downstairs and out into the sunshine, leaving behind the sense of a world that has settled into a perpetual and hopeless gloom. It is only later that I discover the dark history beneath the modernist block, its marble floors. The current apartment building was erected in the 1960s on the site of the London Cage, a wartime interrogation centre whose existence only came to light in 2005. On a site where apartments now sell for tens of millions of pounds, German prisoners were subjected to sleep deprivation, starvation, electric shocks and induced hypothermia. A rather sombre historical coda for the future inhabitants of this particular patch of Billionaire&apos;s Row. Address The Bishops Avenue, N2 Property 7-bed house, 2-bed staff cottage Size 21,000 sq ft Outside space 0.75 acre Price \u00a340m The next Billionaire&apos;s Row used to be known as Millionaire&apos;s Row, when having millions still marked you out from the crowd. The Bishops Avenue in East Finchley snakes northwards from Hampstead Heath, bisected by the rumbling A1. The first houses were constructed at the start of the last century by industrialists looking to build country houses within striking distance of London. George Sainsbury, son of the founder of the supermarket, was an early inhabitant, as was sugar baron William Park Lyle, who built Heath Hall, a 14-bedroom mansion, in 1910. In Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Scoop, the owner of the Daily Beast, Lord Copper, lives on The Bishops Avenue (in a clear case of life imitating art, Richard Desmond has two houses there now). As the road stretched northwards either side of the war, newer money moved in, with Billy Butlin and Gracie Fields building Hollywood-style mansions alongside Sir Peter Saunders and Katie Boyle.     Who would live in a house like this? The plush interior of a property on The Bishops Avenue.  Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Then, at the end of the 1970s, overseas money arrived, a prophetic glimpse of the flood that would swamp London in the decades to come. The road is a kind of constellation of all the violence of the past 30 years, the nationalities of its residents a record of political and economic upheavals. Iranians arrived in the wake of the revolution and subsequent energy crisis. Cypriots came after Turkey invaded the island, among them Asil Nadir, the founder of Polly Peck (now a resident of HMP Belmarsh). On New Year&apos;s Eve 1984, fashion mogul Aristos Constantinou was assassinated by a mystery gunman in his home on the street. Saddam Hussein&apos;s occupation of Kuwait saw an influx of Saudis and Emiratis, with the Saudi royal family snapping up 10 of the street&apos;s 66 homes between 1989 and 1993. Finally, and with the greatest fanfare, the Russians, Indians and Chinese arrived.When Toprak Mansion, a vulgar neoclassical pile, was bought by Kazakh businesswoman Hourieh Peramaa for \u00a350m in 2008, Mikhail Gorbachev was guest of honour at the housewarming party. Lakshmi Mittal, not content with buying up Kensington Palace Gardens, also has a house here. More recently, stories about The Bishops Avenue have focused on the number of properties on the road that have been abandoned by their absentee owners, former palaces whose ballroom floors are slippery with guano, crunch with the skeletons of dead pigeons. The home Salman Rushdie bought and then converted into a safe house during the fatwa years is just one of those that now stands empty (in his memoir Joseph Anton, Rushdie misspells the name of the road throughout, referring to it as &quot;The Bishop&apos;s Avenue&quot;). A recent Guardian investigation found almost a third of the street&apos;s properties were empty, some abandoned for as long as 25 years. Edward Hollis, architectural historian and author of The Secret Lives of Buildings, describes the uncanniness of these deserted homes. &quot;For many of these houses, the bricks and mortar has fallen to pieces, but the investment value remains the same, indeed has skyrocketed in recent years. There&apos;s something very surreal about these multimillion-pound ruins.&quot; Another genial Knight Frank estate agent drives me up from Hampstead High Street, along the heath above Kenwood House, and left on to &quot;The Bishops&quot;, as he calls it. As we drive, he tells me that the reports of empty properties on the road have been overstated, a stance echoed by Trevor Abrahmsohn, founder of luxury estate agent Glentree International. &quot;On a street of 66 houses, it&apos;s perfectly normal for 10 or 12 to be uninhabited \u2013 and that&apos;s all we&apos;re talking about here. There are the Saudi properties, which were a bolthole from Saddam, there are two houses owned by a senator from Pakistan which were unfortunately repossessed [he&apos;s referring to former minister of privatisation, Waqar Ahmed Khan]. Otherwise, the properties that may appear to be vacant are all undergoing some form of regeneration.It&apos;s just that with the size of these projects and the complexity of planning permission, the gestation period from start to finish can be up to five years.&quot;     Faded grandeur: a collapsed ceiling at the Georgians on The Bishops Avenue, north London.   Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Certainly, there is an air of industrial bustle as we make our way up the avenue. Barnet council has apparently refused to carry out any improvements to the surface of the road while so many of its houses are undergoing facelifts. There are dumptrucks and diggers, mini-loaders and bulldozers every 10 yards. I feel like I&apos;m in one of my son&apos;s picture books. Finally, somewhat towards the wrong \u2013 A1 \u2013 end of the street, we pull through automatic gates and into a pristine turning circle of cream-coloured gravel. &quot;This place has serious kerb appeal,&quot; the agent sighs, and I feel like I&apos;ve dipped an icy toe into a world where people say things like this. Stratheden, which is the rather och-aye official name, is better known as the Lego house, a gleaming crenellated lozenge in Cape Dutch style with a teal-green roof. In the entrance hall a Filipino maid greets us with a bow; behind her, modern art \u2013 something that looks Kandinsky-ish, a Keith Haring-esque sculpture on a plinth \u2013 blazes from every surface. The blond parquet steps down into an amaryllis-strewn drawing room: silver velvet sofas, a chaise longue with a bearskin throw slouched over it. We walk past a plush pink private cinema to a dining room whose tabletop is purple lacquer, beautiful silkscreen prints on the walls. It is from the kitchen, though, that you glimpse the house&apos;s main selling point. The garden stretches out dreamlike behind the house, espaliered fruit trees pushing forth their first sticky buds, a turquoise walkway with water flowing within and around it. At the bottom of the\u00a0garden is an annexe \u2013 the entertainment room \u2013 whose roof is turfed with grass that seems\u00a0almost blue in the sunlight. Beyond it, impossibly distant, a colonnaded staff cottage. Descending from the main house into the basement, we pass an enormous bar whose 500-bottle wine rack is filled exclusively with mineral water \u2013 &quot;Not to put off Muslim buyers,&quot; the agent explains \u2013 into a cavernous leisure complex. I look up and realise that we are walking beneath the turquoise water feature in the garden. Through it, high above, the sun hangs in the sky, a vision of a drowned world. We walk through the hushed air of the swimming pool, upon whose roof twinkle a galaxy of stars, a honey-coloured moon. Passing massage rooms, saunas, a service kitchen, we come up into the garden annexe which houses the 3,000 sq ft ballroom. Standing, slightly agoraphobic, in the centre of the sprung dancefloor, I look up to take in the most monstrous chandelier I&apos;ve ever seen \u2013 tens of thousands of crystals dripping from a lake of gold. The agent tells me that the house, like many on the street, had been bought by someone from the Middle East in the 80s and then stood more or less empty for 30 years. It was then purchased by a family trust who set about renovating it, hoping to turn a swift profit. It has been on the market since March last year. Despite the garishness, the chandelier, the bad art, Stratheden has worked its magic upon me. I&apos;m tempted to tell him that my godmother will take it. Then I remember that her move to London is a fiction, and worry that I&apos;ve been spending too long in this world of the super-rich, and ask to be driven to the tube. Address One Hyde Park, SW1 Property 3-bed apartment Size 3,547 sq ft Outside space Small balcony Service charge \u00a360,000 per annum Price \u00a316.95m One Hyde Park, the Richard Rogers-designed monolith that sits at the junction of Sloane Street, Knightsbridge and Brompton Road, is London&apos;s most expensive apartment block. As with many buildings in the city, the money behind One Hyde Park is Qatari. The public face of the project may be the colourful Candy brothers (who also interior designed the apartments), but the financial clout is provided by former Qatari prime minister (and member of the ruling dynasty) Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. Along with Harrods across the road, the Shard, the Olympic Village, Chelsea Barracks and the US embassy on Grosvenor Square, One Hyde Park is part of a flotilla of properties owned by the small, gas-rich nation. From the start, the building met with significant and sustained criticism. First, there was the question of quite how many of the flats had been sold, and to whom. An investigation by the Guardian discovered that 80% of the apartments had been purchased by offshore entities based in the British Virgin Islands, with ownership layered through sophisticated tax-avoidance schemes. The Observer revealed that only nine of 62 apartments were registered for council tax, with five of those nine paying the 50% reduced tariff for second homes. We know that at least one Brit lives in the building: Nick Candy owns a penthouse, where he lives with his wife, the Australian actor Holly Valance. Otherwise, the flavour is exclusively international. Sheik Hamad, via a Cayman-registered company, has a triplex on floors 11-13 of one of the block&apos;s four towers. Other residents are Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine&apos;s richest man and a close ally of deposed former president Viktor Yanukovych. He bought one of the more expensive apartments for \u00a3136m. Also listed are a number of Kazakhs, including Vladimir Kim, a copper billionaire and former politician; Russians, among them Vladislav Doronin, who is stepping out with Naomi Campbell; Chinese, Malaysians and Nigerians. For a historical perspective on the project, I turn again to Edward Hollis. &quot;One Hyde Park plays an interesting double game,&quot; he tells me. &quot;On the one hand it&apos;s there in Knightsbridge, right in the centre of everything, on the other it&apos;s a world set apart, a vertical gated community. It&apos;s built to exclude, like the grand houses of 14th-century Florence \u2013 those palazzos like fortified castles to store money.&quot; Hollis sees it as significant that One Hyde Park is a block of flats in a city more used to expensive houses. &quot;In the 80s, the very wealthy would migrate to the suburbs, buying a huge place out by a golf course like General Pinochet. What&apos;s interesting about One Hyde Park is that it tries to imitate the density of New York. It makes the idea of owning a flat aspirational and this is a good thing: London needs to get denser, not bigger. It&apos;s such a spread-out city \u2013 it covers its own hinterland, there&apos;s no escape. If London keeps growing outwards, it will take over the rest of the country.&quot;     The view from an apartment at One Hyde Park, with Harrods illuminated in the distance.  Photograph: View Pictures/REX    I arrive early for my meeting with yet another Knight Frank agent. I walk around the building&apos;s perimeter, smelling the freshly cut box hedges. The apartment block&apos;s four towers jut forward into the park like the prows of four enormous steam ships. Between each tower (I later learn that the Candys prefer you to call them &quot;pavilions&quot;), there is a lattice of glass and steel, ziggurats of shining staircases, glass lifts. The block is finned with slats of rust-coloured metal. I go around to the front of the building \u2013 the Knightsbridge side \u2013 and browse the windows of the &quot;retail units&quot; on the ground floor that have been chosen to appeal to the apartments&apos; residents, but also, one feels, to convey something about these residents to those of us on the outside, looking in. In the Rolex shop, a sales assistant stares narrowly at me. Next there is a showroom of sleek, gull-winged McLaren cars. Then a branch of the Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank, offering its Diamond Infinite Visa card. Daily ATM withdrawals are capped at \u00a34,000. I reach the entrance where a stocky, clean-shaven security guard eyes me suspiciously. After a brief and chillingly polite interrogation, the guard lets me through, and I make my way along a walkway that cuts through a low water feature where two black stone swans rise from the water, their necks intertwined. I walk into the high and shadowy reception area, where I meet the estate agent and a representative of Candy &amp; Candy, a young blond woman with the clipped vowels and genial firmness of a Roedean hockey captain. She tells me that we&apos;ll take a tour of the building&apos;s communal areas before looking at the fourth-floor apartment I&apos;ve come to inspect. First stop is the library, which apparently attempts to replicate the atmosphere of a gentlemen&apos;s club. There are no books in the library. Even if there were, it would be too dark to read. Every surface is fashioned from dark wood, dark stone, the corners of the room are night-black. There are no other humans in the library. It&apos;s all a bit creepy. We make our way out into the reception and take a lift down into the basement. There is a distinct smell of cabbage in the Serpentine Suite, a private dining room that sits between the golf simulator and the cinema, with its 18 comfy-looking seats and cashmere throws strewn casually over them. We make our way through to the sports facilities, where I&apos;m asked to tie a pair of blue plastic bags over my trainers. A dark and silent swimming pool, ozone-treated &quot;to avoid the smell of chlorine&quot;. The floor of the pool is of dimpled steel. Two saunas, two steam rooms, a squash court with digital scoring. All are empty. The sense of being the last subterranean survivors of some nuclear holocaust increases. The walls, the Candy rep tells me, are covered with eelskin. I press my fingers to the tacky material and draw back \u2013 there is something horrifying in these expanses of shimmering skin. Silence. We are deep under the Knightsbridge streets, but there is no rumble of traffic, no shudder of tube trains. Nothing but the gentle hum of air conditioning. Finally, as we are about to leave the leisure complex, I look up to glimpse a thin woman in pink Lycra, her jaw clenched, her body yoga-contorted. With a quiet whoosh the glass lift carries us to the fourth floor. The apartment I&apos;m being shown is on the city side of the building, its three bedrooms looking out towards Harvey Nichols. The interior is, again, dark, with a kind of light-eating quality to the long panels of wood. I am asked this time to remove my shoes \u2013 the rep slips off her leopard-print ballet pumps \u2013 and don fluffy towelling slippers as I make my way across the shagpile carpet. In the bedroom, she flicks a switch and a smoked mirror descends to hide the television. I feel like applauding. We make our way through to the wide drawing room, where curved sofas surround teak coffee tables. The windows \u2013 she taps one \u2013 are triple glazed, no sound breaks through the thick glass. The steel fins I&apos;d seen from the outside block any potential view of one&apos;s neighbours. A small, chrome kitchen nestles in one corner of the apartment, although the rep explains that most residents take advantage of the arrangement with the neighbouring Mandarin Oriental when they want to eat. There is an underground tunnel that runs between the two buildings, along which One Hyde Park&apos;s 85 serving staff will scurry with food from the hotel&apos;s Heston Blumenthal-run restaurant. I remove the slippers and we make our way back to the lift. Again as I leave the building \u2013 the guard gives me another suspicious once-over \u2013 I&apos;m hit by a sense of the deep melancholy that suffuses the world of the very rich, for all their money and luxury. The emptiness, the silence, that bookless and dreary library. It seems somehow fitting that each of the building&apos;s four penthouses has its own panic room. I wonder if the inhabitants of those sky-towers, those pinnacles of money, ever pause to wonder if it was all worth it? The feverish pursuit of privacy, the monomaniacal drive to avoid paying a penny of tax, the sense of being, as\u00a0Hollis says, both in the city and somehow above it, all of this strikes me as terribly sad. It seems that, granted the riches of Croesus, all people really want to do is avoid other people. I&apos;ll admit that part of my voyage into the world of the London super-rich has been driven by a kind of Through the Keyhole nosiness, a wish to feel that Daily Mail admixture of greed and envy that comes with the leather sofas and chandeliers, the cinemas and supercars. But that&apos;s not the whole story. Andrew Heywood, editor of Housing Finance International, describes the profound social repercussions of the &quot;percolation effect&quot;, whereby shifts in prices at the top of the market trickle down to impact upon all other levels. This, he says, has permanently altered the shape of the city \u2013 for all its inhabitants. &quot;Rich and poor can no longer live cheek by jowl,&quot; he says. &quot;There is no longer the possibility of mobility across the city. If you get a job in west London, the only option is to commute. Now there is a cosmopolitan elite in central London, with the poorer inhabitants forced to move to the suburbs.&quot; He points out the wave of local boroughs selling their council housing stock \u2013 moves that have been described as &quot;social cleansing&quot;. &quot;In the end you&apos;ll get a divided city \u2013 it will lead to ghettoisation.&quot; I also speak about foreign ownership of London property with Nicholas Shaxson, author of Treasure Islands, a brilliant and angry book about global tax avoidance. He is far from complimentary, describing it as &quot;a rather grotesque demonstration of the UK&apos;s willingness to prostitute itself to the world&apos;s hot and dirty money\u2026 The UK has increasingly had cultural characteristics of a tax haven, notably the cowering subservience that successive governments have shown to flighty (and frequently very dirty) international capital. They want to attract it at all costs.&quot; I think again of Edward Hollis&apos;s description of One Hyde Park as a vertical gated community, of the sinister guards at the gates of Kensington Palace Gardens, the soullessness of those empty streets and squares in Chelsea and Belgravia. A word that comes up again and again in the leather-bound brochures of these palatial homes is &quot;exclusive&quot;, and that&apos;s exactly what they are. Either literally \u2013 through gates and guards \u2013 or metaphorically \u2013 through stripping an area of its character, its sense of community \u2013 the most striking effect of the colonisation of London by foreign investors has been the exclusion of everyday people, the erection of barriers, the destruction of social cohesion. Now, as I drive past the blackened windows of super-prime London, past the privacy-finned triple glazing of\u00a0One Hyde Park, I wonder how many of the rich\u00a0are sitting there, in the darkness, looking out\u00a0at us, at all the palpitating life of the city.

Guardian Care Homes had alleged that the bank had mis-sold it two interest rate swaps worth \u00a370m that were linked to Libor, the benchmark interest rate used to price financial products worth about \u00a3300tn around the world. The case was being watched closely by the banking industry, which is already making compensation claims to customers mis-sold interest rate swaps, amid fears that it could encourage more customers to bring cases linked to Libor. Barclays argued that the swaps bought in 2007 and 2008 cost it millions of pounds as interest rates fell following the 2008 banking crisis. Diamond, who is now building a banking business in Africa, left Barclays in July 2012 in the wake of the furore caused by the bank&apos;s \u00a3290m fine for rigging Libor, the first significant penalty for attempts to manipulate the rate, but one that has since been eclipsed by rival banks. He and others, including the former co-heads of the investment bank, Rich Ricci and Jerry del Missier, were also possible witnesses in the high court when the trial was due to begin at the end of this month. But a settlement has been reached under which Barclays will restructure a loan, thought to be worth about \u00a340m, to Guardian Care Homes&apos; owner, Graiseley. This led to the legal action being dropped. A Barclays spokesman said: &quot;In response to discussions with Graiseley, in order to support the ongoing viability of Graiseley&apos;s care home business, the parties have agreed to a commercial restructuring of Graiseley&apos;s debt, which reflects the impact of changes in conditions in this sector over the last few years. Graiseley has withdrawn the litigation.&quot; Graiseley did not immediately comment. Until last week, Barclays had been arguing that the case, which had already involved a string of court appearances, was &quot;without merit&quot;, and argued that the care homes operator owed it \u00a370m. The Libor element of the proceedings had been added after Barclays was fined for rigging the benchmark rate and the case had been delayed while the bank failed in its attempts to have this element thrown out. Among the twists and turns of the proceedings were those in January last year, when the court had ordered the identities of more than 100 current and former employees of Barclays to be revealed despite their attempts to remain anonymous. They included the former finance director Chris Lucas and Diamond&apos;s predecessor John Varley, whose emails were scrutinised during the regulatory investigation that led to the fine. At the time, the bank and the judge stressed that this did not mean those individuals were involved in rigging Libor. Court papers released during the proceedings also appeared to suggest that a Barclays investment fund operated by a Singapore trader had been manipulating Libor, although the bank had argued the evidence was not relevant. It was the first trial related to Libor to reach the courts and was due to carry on for a number of weeks, during which time a number of former and current Barclays employees were thought likely to be called at witnesses. It is believed Barclays&apos; legal bill to defend the case has already amounted to more than \u00a310m. Since Barclays was fined for Libor rigging, a number of other banks have been fined, including Royal Bank of Scotland, which paid \u00a3390m to regulators in the UK and US, Swiss bank UBS, which was fined \u00a3940m, and Dutch bank Rabobank which was fined \u00a3662m. Money broker Icap was fined \u00a355m, while regulators are continuing their investigation into the manipulation of the rate. A number of individuals have also been charged for Libor rigging in cases brought by the Serious Fraud Office, including three from Barclays who were charged in February.

Mark Jones Ian Hislop&apos;s Olden Days \u2013 The Power Of The Past In Britain9pm, BBC2 The British, thinks Ian Hislop, &quot;relish harking back&quot;. It&apos;s a creative process as much as a historical endeavour. Underlining his point, Hislop devotes this opening episode of a three-part series to how we perceive and use the past via a probably fictional king, Arthur, and a real-life one, Alfred. In charting how, for example, Henry VIII pimped the Winchester round table with fresh paint ahead of a state visit, Hislop shows how focusing on interpretations of the past can be as revealing as yer actual history. Jonathan Wright  Dead Famous DNA9pm, Channel 4 In the last in the series, veterinary surgeon-turned-TV presenter Mark Evans concludes his quest to flesh out the stories of the famous dead, using clues gleaned from their DNA. It&apos;s a mixed bag this week, as he meets a Canadian dentist who owns one of John Lennon&apos;s teeth and one day hopes to clone the Beatles star. He also tries to discover whether body parts that are claimed to be those of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun are authentic and, if they are, what information they might hold.

Don Hany plays Aussie sleuth Sam Callaghan, a premium-cable Marlowe dragged into a murder investigation muddied by the presence of Commonwealth forces, CIA agents and criminal gangs.

Originally starting in London, they have since travelled to destinations including Sun City, Macau, Singapore and \u2026 Sheffield. This year Tampa Bay, Florida, gets the honour. It&apos;s the first year the IIFAs have ventured to the US, and already the interest is high. More than 18,000 tickets have been sold to the shows and award ceremonies that are open to the paying public. Although it&apos;s called IIFA Weekender, the festival runs from Wednesday to Saturday (at this point I&apos;ll say that if you&apos;re a stickler for detail, Bollywood might not be your cup of chai). Events will unfold before an anticipated 30,000 visitors, and those who attend will be just the tip of iceberg: an estimated 800 million people around the world are expected to tune in on TV. The festival attracts all the stars of the Indian film world, along with their legions of fans, and hotels in Tampa are filling up fast. Too fast. My &quot;hotel&quot;, I discover after I book, doubles as a college dormitory and is 20 minutes from the action. Reviews on Trip Advisor are making me anxious. &quot;Sorely disappointed&quot; about a &quot;nasty room&quot; is not something I want to be feel. I had planned to stay downtown at the Hilton, where much of the IIFA action \u2013 from press conferences to media briefings \u2013 will take place. There will even be a Hollywood-meets-Bollywood acting class \u2013 Kevin Spacey and Vidya Balan in front of eager students. To get a sense of the four-day festival, imagine mixing the glamour of the Academy Awards with stage-show spectaculars of London&apos;s most impressive West End musicals, while bolting on a business expo and a &quot;media and entertainment summit&quot;. And let&apos;s not forget the after parties\u2026 The two major events are on Friday and Saturday. Friday is the IIFA Magic of the Movies show. I&apos;m envisioning a kaleidoscope of costumed dancers gyrating on stage behind Bollywood stars lip-synching their catchiest tracks. According to the organisers, as in any classic Bollywood film, &quot;music takes centre stage&quot;. Vir Das and Saif Ali Khan \u2013 the Indian equivalent of James Corden and Prince William (if Prince William gave acting a go), will host. (As far as Saif Ali Khan is concerned, the term Bollywood royalty is bang on the money: he is the 10th Nawab of Pataudi and the descendant of the rulers of the now-abolished princely state.) They&apos;ll announce the technical awards on that same evening \u2013 highlighting the best in everything from dance steps (best choreography) to lipstick (best makeup). All this taking place in an actual amphitheatre!     India's Prince William \u2026 Saif Ali Khan (left, in Aarakshan) will co-host the IIFA Magic of the Movies show in Florida. Photograph: Reliance Entertainment     But that&apos;s just the warm-up. On Saturday the awards for best male actor, best female actor, best picture and the rest of the usual award-ceremony gongs will be handed out. What makes the IIFAs different to the Academy Awards is that normal members of the public can simply buy a ticket to attend. I say normal, but $562.25 (\u00a3335.85) \u2013 the cheapest seat in the house \u2013 may be a little beyond the reach of many people. If money is no object, or you&apos;re simply feeling decadent, then $3,294.75 (\u00a31,968) can put you just 17 rows from the stage. It can also get you into the night before&apos;s ceremony and, intriguingly, the invite-only IIFA Rocks stage show on Thursday. It seems that where Bollywood is concerned, money talks. On Saturday night, the closing show&apos;s hosts are actors Shahid Kapoor and Farhan Akhtar. They will be delivering witty one-liners as winners glide effortlessly on stage and hold their accolades aloft. Meanwhile, the losers will try to keep smiling and politely clap while the cameras zoom in to detect the slightest flicker of envy or disgust. Some awards ceremony rituals are universal after all.  \u2022 IIFA 2014 will take place in Tampa Bay, Florida from 23-26 April"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/a-guide-to-understanding-bob-carr-and-his-many-and-varied-passions", "sentences": ["\u201cSpecifically, I have taken note of the lack of English subtitles for the Wagner Opera Siegfried,\u201d Carr quotes the vice president of Singapore Airlines as saying.", "We\u2019ve asked Singapore Airlines to provide us with an update on the Wagner deficit in their entertainment package."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-10T04:55:27Z", "title": "A guide to understanding Bob Carr and his many and varied passions", "tags": ["Australia news"], "article": "Bob Carr\u2019s diary has been a titillating read for political enthusiasts. The book has revealed extraordinary details about the formation of policy on asylum seekers and Israeli settlements, and Carr\u2019s view on former prime ministers Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd. But there have also been a lot of inexplicable references. Here\u2019s a guide to help explain some of the more unusual terms and activities Carr mentions. What is \u201cthe wonderful one-legged Romanian deadlift\u201d? This is an exercise that is basically the Monty Python silly walk but with dumbbells. These are apparently Carr\u2019s favourite exercises.                      What are deep-cut obliques? \u201cMy ambition [is] to have a concave abdomen defined by deep-cut obliques.\u201d Bob is very proud of his abdominals, and writes about vying for \u201ca concave abdomen defined by deep-cut obliques\u201d. Flat stomachs seems to be an important diplomatic asset to him, referring to the \u201celite of the flat-stomached\u201d, such as Barack Obama. To give a clearer indication of a what such a stomach may look like, True Blood\u2019s Alcide Herveaux is probably a good point of reference, but not of comparison.     Alcide Herveaux. Photograph: HBO    Which airlines do pyjamas in business class? \u201cBusiness class. No edible food. No airline pyjamas. I lie in my tailored suit.\u201d In a press conference on Thursday, Carr defended his moaning about having to fly business class by saying it was important for him to get a good night\u2019s sleep. The good news for Carr is that, the next time he flies business class with Qantas (if there ever is such a time), he can be sure to get pyjamas there. A spokesman confirmed Qantas was &quot;one of the few&quot; airlines to offer the service. You even get a doona. What are steel-cut oats? Steel cut oats are gentleman\u2019s oats. They are cooked the old-fashioned way \u2013 with minimal preservatives \u2013 and are great for porridge, although they take longer to cook as a result of the way they\u2019ve been cut. They are a great source of fibre, which would no doubt be of great importance to the well-executed bowel movements of the frequent flying statesman. Carr counts Prince Charles among \u201cthe elite of the flat-stomached\u201d. Does Charles really have a flat stomach? It\u2019s doubtful. But he does wear very nice suits.     Prince Charles.  Photograph: Steve Barber/PA    What is whey protein? \u201cI\u2019ve got to order two main courses to come close to my protein targets. I\u2019ve been wolfing down whey protein powder (cross flow, micro-filtered and hydrolysed) and branch-chain amino acid tablets.\u201d Whey protein is a popular protein supplement used by gym junkies. While the image normally conveyed of its users is that of hulking tree trunks who struggle to make it through a door frame without stepping sideways, apparently the former foreign minister is also a fan.  What airlines show Wagner? \u201cSpecifically, I have taken note of the lack of English subtitles for the Wagner Opera Siegfried,\u201d Carr quotes the vice president of Singapore Airlines as saying. We\u2019ve asked Singapore Airlines to provide us with an update on the Wagner deficit in their entertainment package. Although it turns out Carr already has a DVD of Wagner\u2019s Siegfried at home, according to an earlier biography.

Most impressive architecture: Frankfurt     The Frankfurt Marathon. Photograph: Alex Domanski/AP     I really like the mix of low- and high-rise architecture. There&apos;s a lot of glass and steel, and interesting shapes mixed with traditional buildings in the city centre. Frankfurt has a bit of history, and you have the modern architecture. It\u2019s vibrant and the tall steeples made of red brick seemed unusual. Near the start and finish line, there&apos;s a tribute to it being a manufacturing city: a moving statue of a man beating a piece of metal with a hammer and anvil. The finish is in a festival hall; the great dome in the middle is fantastic.  Most dangerous city: New York     Men's elite runners contend with potholes during the New York City Marathon. Photograph: Adam Hunger/Reuters     The organisers know so many people want to run because of the prestige, and they take advantage of that. For example, there are no lights in the covered bridge about 15 miles in, so you can&apos;t see the potholes. In fact, there are a lot of potholes all along the route, and overall the event could be more user-friendly \u2013 especially given the entry fee of $300. You take a bus to the start-line at Staten Island, but because they close the bridge, you have to arrive several hours before you start running \u2013 on a cold November day. We were looking for cardboard boxes to sit on.  Worst drainage: Lahore     The Lahore Marathon. Photograph: Arif Ali/AFP/Getty Images     For an international run, the organisers could have chosen a better route. When I did it, there were puddles on the side of the road from all the recent rain, and open drains in some places which were not exactly aromatic. Maybe they didn\u2019t have the drains in parts of the race. You need a route to appeal to a wide range of runners from abroad, particularly if you want to show the best bits of the city. There again, it\u2019s understandable as Lahore isn\u2019t one of the modern economies. And the finish was fantastic as it was inside a stadium.  Best quality roads: Chicago     The Chicago Marathon. Photograph: Jeff Roberson/AP     The roads were wider and cleaner than any other city race I have run in \u2013 a mix of tarmac and concrete \u2013 and it was one of the fastest times I\u2019ve done in the last 10 years: four hours, 28 minutes and 59 seconds. The roads were also not so congested with traffic or parked vehicles, even where they were still part-open during the race. New York, by comparison, is an older and more built-up city than Chicago. The pavements are relatively small, and the tram-lines can be a hazard for runners.  Best public toilets: Toronto     Toilets at the Toronto Marathon. Photograph: Rick Madonik/Toronto Star via Getty     If you\u2019re a good marathon runner, you won\u2019t need to use the portable loos at halfway \u2013 but in Toronto they were at just the right place for me, and best of all they were clean. You come out of the town centre to the lake side, and you know exactly where they are \u2013 which is important, bearing in mind the clock is ticking when you go. In some marathons, the loos are located 100 yards after the finish, or outside County Hall ... Generally, there could always be more at certain places to reduce the queues, but you will be more disappointed with yourself for needing to go.  Most forward-thinking city: Luxembourg     The Luxembourg Marathon     This marathon starts at 7pm; you run a few circles of the city, past residential areas, up and downhill. They try to cater for every client group and know how to promote their city. People are still out there cheering you on at 1am \u2013 particularly around the town square, where the bars and restaurants are still open and packed with social drinkers cheering the slower marathon runners. They try to embrace diversity because of the international money markets upon which much of Luxembourg&apos;s economy is based. As an ethnic-minority runner, you feel very welcome.  Cleanest city: Singapore     The Singapore Marathon. Photograph: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images     There is no rubbish on the roads or foot paths. During my visit, I saw two-year-olds running around trying to find bins for their sweet wrappers instead of them throwing them away. It\u2019s a cultural thing, the people are disciplined and I like that. People don\u2019t litter because you get fined, it\u2019s a mindset. It means as a runner, you know you\u2019re not going to trip up on any litter as the streets seem to be cleaned as if by magic. They start the race at 5am because of the humidity but the city is always clean.  Best park to unwind in: Hong Kong     Runners cross the finish line in Victoria Park during the 2013 Hong Kong Marathon. Photograph: Gareth Gay/Getty     There isn\u2019t that much green space in Hong Kong, but you do have Victoria Park where the race finishes. It&apos;s a great spot to crash out and have a massage. You don\u2019t feel inclined to rush back to your hotel; you can just soak in the sun or use the shade of the well laid-out tree lines in the park. You feel extremely safe and are close to all amenities. There are hundreds and thousands of people in the area but you are left alone; it\u2019s big enough for everyone.  Noisiest crowd: London     The London Marathon is one of the best supported. Photograph: Tony Sapiano/Rex     In my home city, the runners are well supported by the public throughout the 26 miles \u2013 even in bad weather. The crowd has a fantastic sense of humour: they&apos;ll cheer the world-class athletes 100 metres into the race by saying: \u2018You can do it, don\u2019t give up.\u2019 Everyone is having a laugh. You\u2019ve got music from bands and little kids offering sweets and oranges to runners between the feeding stations; it is charming. This year will be my 30th consecutive London marathon; I\u2019m looking forward to the crowds at places like Tower Bridge and Big Ben.  Harmander Singh set up the Sikhs in the City running club.

A management buyout and a recession later, Anne has built international trade into half the business &quot;and that proportion is likely to rise still further&quot;, she says. The tool reclamation company has been reconditioning equipment for engineering firms since 1969 \u2013 &quot;quite simply, we take old worn tools and make them good as new&quot;. But the process was virtually unheard of in south-east Asia until Wilson visited Singapore on a trade trip and made contact with a distributor. That led to business in Malaysia, where Numill&apos;s reclamation process meant a drill used in the aerospace and oil industries could be reconditioned and put back to use for around 30% of the cost of buying a new one. Now Wilson hopes the region will provide a gateway into China. Wilson joined the Sheffield company in 2000 as a book-keeper, gradually growing her role over the years and completing degree and postgraduate courses in management as a mature student at the same time. When the boss decided to retire in 2006, she borrowed a significant sum of money and bought out the business. A couple of good years followed until the financial crisis and recession hit Britain in 2008. Numill&apos;s business was hit hard and it was &quot;quite hairy for a time&quot;, Wilson recalls. But as well as a rough ride, the recession also provided the incentive she needed to expand the company&apos;s international side. She set her sights on Europe first, expanding existing networks and pushing into new areas, including the Czech Republic. &quot;We tend to work with agents who are already serving engineering companies in their area, and then we can add to the services they offer,&quot; Wilson says. Word of mouth and Numill&apos;s website are also important drivers of new business. Final clients could be in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, rail or general engineering \u2013 the common factor being that they have invested large amounts of money in equipment which could end up being thrown away once a key part has worn down by just a tiny amount.

The Bank of England has so far declined to comment. The complaint comes as the US mulls over fresh sanctions against Russia, after President Vladimir Putin threatened to stop gas supplies to Ukraine over unpaid bills. The US and EU have already launched sanctions against Bank Rossiya, a smaller bank with close ties to the Kremlin. Kostin, a member of Putin&apos;s United Russia party, is one of Russia&apos;s most powerful bankers, and led the push for VTB&apos;s overseas expansion, setting up investment banking offices in London, Hong Kong, Dubai and Singapore. VTB Capital, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and flies the Russian flag from its palatial office in the heart of the City - almost opposite the Bank of England&apos;s headquarters. The crisis in Ukraine has put the spotlight on the City&apos;s links with Russia, and embarrassed the UK government, after a civil servant was photographed with a document saying the financial centre should not be closed to Russians. Kostin said he had been visited by a number of western bankers, from Europe and the US, who had &quot;specifically flown in to confirm their intention&quot; of working with VTB.

The business is perhaps better known locally for its bakeries-cum-cafes, of which 32 are located in south Vietnam, and another five in Luc&apos;s native Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The bakery frequently introduces new products, and Luc \u2013 who spent two years as an apprentice at a piston factory \u2013 often designs the machinery himself. &quot;We are always the first. Some other bakeries, they look at the cake, very nice, but they cannot copy because I designed the machine myself,&quot; he says, with a mellifluous laugh. Luc&apos;s achievements are all the more remarkable considering his family&apos;s troubled history. In 1979 they were among thousands of Cambodian refugees who fled to Vietnam to escape the bloody dictatorship of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge. Luc&apos;s parents were of ethnic Chinese origin and ran two general stores in Phnom Penh until Pol Pot&apos;s Khmer Rouge entered the city in 1975, beginning a four-year reign of terror which cost the lives of as many as 2 million Cambodians.     Kao Sieu Luc. Photograph: Marianne Brown    Urban residents across the country were forced back to the land, money was abolished and intellectuals ruthlessly suppressed. Eleven members of the Kao family were moved to a collective farm with more than 130 other families in a village far from the city. &quot;We grew corn, potatoes, bananas, rice \u2013 a lot, but we never had enough to eat,&quot; Luc says. &quot;It was very hard, very difficult because we worked every day, a lot of work, but still there was not enough food to eat.&quot; Luc&apos;s father and elder brother starved to death. Some families also faced summary execution for reasons that were never explained. &quot;They put up a list of the names and afterwards the families were taken away, not far, and killed,&quot; Luc says. &quot;First they killed about 28 families, second time about 30 and the third time only about 10 families \u2013 the last time my family&apos;s name was on the list,&quot; he says. But on Christmas Day 1978, Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia, capturing Phnom Penh two weeks later. In the chaos that ensued, the Kao family managed to escape back to the\u00a0capital. Luc&apos;s niece, Alice Kao Hui Sia, who now works as Luc&apos;s assistant and is a branch manager at ABC Bakery, was 12 years old at the time. She says the only possessions the family had when they set off for the capital was a cooking pot and some rice. &quot;We were fighting for the food along the road, and for water. It took a long time to walk, more than one month because we walked and we stopped, we walked and we stopped,&quot; she said. &quot;I was the eldest child in my [immediate] family, my sisters were very small. They were walking along with us, we felt so tired and sad. But we survived.&quot; After staying in a makeshift shelter in Phnom Penh, the family decided to make the long journey to Vietnam, again by foot. They arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, in 1979. &quot;When we arrived here we had nothing, no friends, no family,&quot; Luc said. &quot;We could speak not even one word of the Vietnamese language.&quot; Luc got a job carting rice to market stalls, and later wheat. The family got a stall of their own, where they packaged wheat brought in from the countryside to sell at a bigger market. But the family&apos;s trials did not end there. In 1980 they were rounded up to live in one of two refugee camps set up by the United Nations high commissioner for refugees. &quot;You have nothing to do in the refugee camp. In the morning you watch the sunrise, in the evening you watch the sunset, so it was very boring,&quot; Alice says. &quot;That&apos;s why he ran away after just one month,&quot; she adds, nodding towards Luc. &quot;He stayed with some friends and started a business.&quot; At first, Luc delivered flour to bakeries, but then decided to build his own oven and bake sweet rolls and sponge cake. At first he packed the cakes on his motorbike and sold them to street sellers; later he built more ovens to sell cakes from his house. In 1989 \u2013 three years after the Vietnam launched economic reforms, known as &quot;doi moi&quot; \u2013 Luc married a Vietnamese woman and founded Duc Phat bakery. Shortly afterwards, he became a Vietnamese citizen. Over the next decade Luc took advantage of the new open economy, and made trips to Japan, France and the United States to learn different baking techniques and import machinery. When the couple split in 2005, Luc&apos;s ex-wife took the Duc Phat name, and the ABC Bakery was born. Today, business has never been better as more global brands enter the market and sign contracts with ABC Bakery. The company is building a new $4m factory on the outskirts of the city to keep up with demand. &quot;This factory will be three floors, one floor for McDonald&apos;s, one for Japanese products, one for the export market,&quot; Luc said. But Luc is not interested in international expansion. The most important thing, he says, is that ABC Bakery remains a tightly run, family business. &quot;The name is from my three children. A, Angela, B, Bruce and C, Christine \u2013 ABC,&quot; Luc says. &quot;All the children studied in Singapore. Now they have come back to help me with the business. I am old, it&apos;s their turn now.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/13/berlin-property-boom-germans-end-home-rental", "sentences": ["Many of them already own &quot;a flat in London, maybe an apartment in Singapore&quot;, said sales manager Von Albert \u2013 many of the flats behind Bertolt Brecht are likely to remain empty for most of the year."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-12T23:05:00Z", "title": "Berlin gripped by property boom as Germans turn their backs on renting", "tags": ["Germany", "Renting property", "House prices", "Housing", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "A few yards from the Berliner Ensemble theatre, which he helped to found in 1949, Bertolt Brecht sits on a chair, gazing with a wry smile over the river Spree. It&apos;s a shame that the bronze statue can&apos;t move, because it would be interesting to see what the Marxist playwright would have made of the building site behind his back. On the northern side of Brecht&apos;s square, workers are putting the finishing touches to the most extravagant building project in the German capital: a nine-floor residential block in Mitte district conceived by the British property developer John Hitchcox and French designer Philippe Starck, with wide balconies, a red-leather-clad lobby and a spa area decorated with glass chandeliers. A concierge will do &quot;anything from booking their flights to putting cartons of milk in their fridges&quot;, as the sales manager Alexander von Albert sells it. The building complex, called Yoo Berlin, is set to open in the summer \u2013 90 out of 95 flats have already been sold. The penthouse at the very top, which went for \u20ac4.1m, is being touted as the most expensive in the city. Currently, Berlin&apos;s priciest flat is a bit of a mess, as the owner has decided to rip out the work already done and bring in his own designer. Strolling through the debris, Hans-Peter Koopmann, who manages publicity for the development, points out sights on the horizon: &quot;That&apos;s the Reichstag, there&apos;s the Victory column, and from this angle you can look straight into Angela Merkel&apos;s living room.&quot; No other residential properties will obscure its new owners&apos; view: the district council specially lifted a ban on high-rise flats for Yoo. Compared with London prices, \u20ac14,137 per square metre may not sound much \u2013 residents of One Hyde Park are willing to fork out four times the amount \u2013 but it certainly puts a lie to the first half of Berlin&apos;s self-assigned catchphrase &quot;poor but sexy&quot;. Looking at the capital from up here, a line from Brecht&apos;s The Threepenny Opera, which long ago premiered at the Berliner Ensemble next door, sounds a more appropriate motto: &quot;Listen closely to Mack the Knife / the bulging pocket makes the easy life.&quot; Attitudes to property are changing in Germany, especially so in the three biggest cities \u2013 Munich, Hamburg and Berlin. Over centuries, the capital fostered a reputation as a renter&apos;s paradise, where tenants paid little and were well protected by the law. In 2011 only 16% of Berliners owned their own place, compared with 50% in London. But rents are rising quickly in Berlin, at almost twice the national average rate. At the moment they may still be half of those in Munich, but Nikolas Jeissing, head of the commercial branch of estate agents Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers, suggests the capital will eventually catch up. &quot;In the long run I imagine that it will be more expensive to rent in Berlin than in Munich,&quot; she says. The German coalition government may be planning to introduce rent controls in the bigger cities, but Jeissing believes they will only &quot;slow down the trend, not stop it&quot;. Increasingly some young families are forced to calculate if they would not be safer buying their next flat than renting precariously. In addition, with interest rates remaining low across the eurozone, a nation that traditionally saves a tenth of its income has had to learn to look elsewhere to park its savings. And with the economy still unstable elsewhere in Europe, German property has begun to look safer than ever: betongold \u2013 &quot;concrete gold&quot;, some in Germany call it, though Koopmann of Yoo quibbles with the term. &quot;Gold is actually quite a volatile investment \u2013 property in the centre of Berlin, on the other hand, is as safe as it gets.&quot; Half of Yoo Berlin&apos;s buyers are foreign investors, from Britain, America, France and &quot;very few Russians&quot;. Many of them already own &quot;a flat in London, maybe an apartment in Singapore&quot;, said sales manager Von Albert \u2013 many of the flats behind Bertolt Brecht are likely to remain empty for most of the year. But whether foreigners are the main drivers of Berlin&apos;s betongold boom, as some analysts have claimed, is questionable. Agencies may now rank Berlin in third place on the European investment market, after London and Rome, and the parents of Spanish, Italian or Greek twentysomethings may be more familiar with the German capital than they were a decade ago, but Jeissing of Engel &amp; V\u00f6lkers puts foreign investors&apos; share in the retail investment rise at roughly 30%, considerably down from before the financial crisis. &quot;The big Anglo-Saxon investors like Goldman Sachs discovered Berlin in around 2004, but now they are increasingly retreating and are more likely to look at Spain or Greece,&quot; she says. James Guerin, the Irish CEO of Berlin-based Natulis property group, agrees: &quot;Even though a lot of money is flowing into the city in the form of property purchasers from countries where the local economy is weak, like Greece, Italy, Spain, this is not having a big impact on the business here except for some luxury projects. In fact, there were more foreign buyers in the mid-90s.&quot; Guerin&apos;s company is building flats on the site of a ruined old factory, on Scharnhorststrasse north of the central station. Only 10% of his buyers come from abroad. Most of them are upper-middle-class Germans, many of whom are buying property for their children. Walking around the building site, looking at the cranes working on the open spaces nearby, there is a sense that Berlin is busy closing up remaining gaps. &quot;Time is running out to buy in Berlin,&quot; Guerin says. Once all the empty plots are built on, will Berlin go the way of Paris or London, with amateur developers doing up older properties to sell for a profit and the poorer part of the population being pushed out to the suburbs? Film-maker Katrin Rothe has personal experience with aggressive developers. In her award-winning 2013 documentary Betongold, she recorded her struggles with a landlord who was trying to push tenants out of their block of flats to make way for buyers. By the end of film, Rothe gave in to the pressure and found herself wondering whether home ownership may not be the future for Berlin residents. Talking to her now, she sounds reinvigorated. &quot;In the end I decided that it&apos;s worth fighting for cheap rents in Berlin. This city has a history of doing this differently. We should heed the warning of the Spanish property crash: if you buy property, you can quickly lose a sense for the real value of a home,&quot; she says. Even James Guerin agrees that exponential increases comparable with those in London are unlikely. &quot;Germans are more prudent in property purchasing. There is no property ladder here. They tend to buy later in life and hold their properties long term. It&apos;s primarily a home and secondarily an investment.&quot; Most German banks require around 20% deposit and tend to offer 10-year fixed interest rates, which deters buyers from reselling after a few years. Unlike Britain, Germany still has a strong tradition of local associations that offer legal advice to tenants. Tenants&apos; rights are still stronger than those of buyers, so that investors who buy occupied flats could well find themselves not being able to make use of their new acquisition. &quot;I am hopeful that the idea of property as a social service rather than an asset is embedded in Berlin&apos;s mentality,&quot; says Reiner Wild of the Berlin tenants&apos; association. &quot;We&apos;ll do our very best to make sure that our city doesn&apos;t go the way of Paris or London.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/14/top-10-budget-restaurants-food-trucks-vancouver", "sentences": ["LondonTop 10 budget restaurants in central London SingaporeTop 10 cheap eats in Singapore LimaPeru&apos;s foodie revolution BangkokA three-day itinerary in Bangkok"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-14T05:00:00Z", "title": "Top 10 budget restaurants and food trucks in Vancouver", "tags": ["Vancouver holidays", "Food and drink", "Canada holidays", "North and Central America holidays", "Travel", "Food & drink", "Street food", "Restaurants"], "article": "British Columbia&apos;s metropolitan pride and joy is not known for its affordability.

He loves the space and relatively clean air. Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman    Last month, China announced its new urbanisation plan, a massive feat of technical and social engineering which will move more than 100 million country-dwellers into cities over the next six years. The question is how. China\u2019s current development model has proved environmentally disastrous; ghost cities and towns have triggered fears of an impending real-estate meltdown. Chinese authorities began encouraging the construction of \u201ceco-cities\u201d in the middle of the last decade; since then, hundreds have sprouted across the country. While the concept is vaguely defined, most eco-cities are built on once-polluted or non-arable land, comply with stringent green architectural standards, and experiment with progressive urban planning and transportation infrastructure. The catch is that they simply may not work \u2013 if, indeed, they get finished at all. According to Neville Mars, a Shanghai-based architect who is writing a book about eco-cities, Tianjin has an advantage because of its proximity to a major metropolis and shipping hub: \u201cIt\u2019s already proving to be successful, because it\u2019s still building.\u201d Many other ambitious eco-city projects \u2013 including Hebei province\u2019s Caofeidian, once considered the crown jewel of the movement \u2013 have ground to a halt. The problem, says Mars, is the \u201cnew city model\u201d \u2013 the goal of building a whole city from the ground up rather than letting it develop organically. \u201cYou can want to design your urban landscape, but in reality, on a fundamental level, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to acknowledge that it&apos;s extremely hard to build a regular city from scratch.\u201d Furthermore, some experts say that certified green buildings and pedestrian-friendly roads are a worthless patch for China\u2019s environmental woes, not a solution. \u201cChinese people use a lot of coal because it\u2019s very cheap,\u201d says Tao Ran, acting director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Centre for Public Policy. \u201cIf coal doesn\u2019t become much more expensive, then enterprises won\u2019t use more green energy.\u201d     Visitors look at a model of Tianjin Eco-city. Once finished it will cover 30 km sq and house 350,000 people. Photograph: Allison Jackson/AFP/Getty Images    At present, the Tianjin Eco-city feels more like a simulacrum of a viable community than the real thing. Its buildings are designed to the world\u2019s most stringent environmental standards, but they stand mostly unused.  \u201cThe idea is to ensure that what we build here is commercially viable,\u201d says Ho Tong Yen, chief executive of the city\u2019s master developer. \u201cIt should not be an expensive project funded mainly through government subsidies.\u201d Over the past year, he says the project has made strides, selling about 400 housing units a month \u2013 a rate which Ho describes as \u201chealthy\u201d. President Xi Jinping visited last May; in January, the city\u2019s developers presented to the United Nations in New York.  \u201cIf you ask me what is most unique about Tianjin Eco-city,&quot; Ho adds, &quot;it is the comprehensiveness with which we are tackling the question of sustainability in the development of a city.\u201d  On an official city tour, assistant public relations manager Gang Wei walks through a sparkling \u2013 yet unoccupied \u2013 glass-and-steel office building, enumerating its environmental advantages. Nearly a third of its energy comes from turbines and solar panels, he says; its stairs wind up through the centre of the building, encouraging occupants to shun the elevator. Yet while the developer claims that more than 1,000 companies have registered in the city, many storefronts on its main shopping plaza stand empty; two frozen escalators lead to a mostly-vacant upper floor.

Photograph: Jonathan Kaiman    At one of the city\u2019s three schools, the red-brick Ivy Mi Kindergarten and Primary School, office manager Xu Wenjiao stands in a sun-drenched front lobby more befitting a wealthy tech startup than an educational institution. Xu says that tuition costs only about \u00a340 a month, compared with more than twice that in central Tianjin. \u201cIt\u2019s to encourage people to move here,\u201d she says. \u201cInvestors want homes occupied.\u201d Xu strides through pristine hallways, opening doors to a music room, a spacious kitchen, a library furnished with beanbag chairs and potted plants. \u201cThis is our garden,\u201d she says, pointing out of a window at the school\u2019s backyard \u2013 a small brick terrace dotted with dry plots of brown earth. Behind the garden is a low wall, plastered with English phrases like \u201cthe seeds of fresh life, new bungalow\u201d and \u201cfresh air, bright sunshine, broad view, free breath\u201d. Beyond that, a construction yard stretches into the distance. The air reverberates with the thwacking sound of a pile driver. It is a familiar sound in Tianjin. With support from the central Chinese authorities, the municipality has shaped its outlying areas into an endless sprawl of showcase projects. Beyond the eco-city lies an ersatz ancient town, a free market zone with its own football team, and a half-built financial centre which, according to its developers, will someday rival Manhattan. Construction is everywhere; people are scarce. Xu turns around and opens a door into a classroom, where brightly-dressed primary school children are busy finger-painting, reading books and building block castles. \u201cNotice that they\u2019re all doing their own activities,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know it\u2019s best to let every child develop in her own way.\u201d In Tianjin Eco-city, the future is a blank slate. \u2022 Interactive photographs: the rise, fall (and rebirth?) of Detroit"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/14/cities-animals-urban-environment-species", "sentences": ["Singapore is the stand-out example, a city in which it\u2019s possible to twitch some 347 native birds, of which 12 are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-14T11:11:43Z", "title": "Should cities be for animals too?", "tags": ["Cities", "Animals", "Environment", "Biodiversity", "Wildlife", "World news"], "article": "Humans are becoming ever more urban in their habits, yet it\u2019s only recently that scientists have attempted to quantify the impact of urbanisation on levels of biodiversity around the world. One striking recent global analysis of bird and plant diversity showed just how dramatically the built environment hits birds. For every species spotted in a given urban environment, there are typically more than 10 in an equivalent area of non-urban habitat. This might sound like a dismal statistic, but it\u2019s also an opportunity \u2013 a valuable benchmark from which we can now improve. \u201cThere are many reasons why urban biodiversity matters,\u201d says Mark Goddard, a biologist at the University of Leeds and one of the authors on the recent paper.  For a start, many of the world\u2019s major cities are located in prime locations that are naturally rich in species and still support a significant number. Singapore is the stand-out example, a city in which it\u2019s possible to twitch some 347 native birds, of which 12 are on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In India, thanks to the reverence that Hindus places on cows, elephants and monkeys, there is room for all these animals in even the busiest of cities. Indeed, when conditions in the countryside get really hostile, the urban environment may be the best place for animals to be. This was probably the case for Hanuman langur monkeys during a severe drought in Rajasthan in 2000 that caused around half of the non-urban population to die off. In Jodhpur, where the animals had access to plenty of food and water, there was almost no change in the population size. Among primates, it\u2019s baboons that do best in a human-altered world. One of the best-studied urban populations is in Cape Town, South Africa, where the chacma baboon has been living cheek by jowl with humans since at least the 15th century. In spite of the increasing pressures on the wild spaces around the city, the local baboon population is estimated to have risen from 365 in 1998 to 475 in 2011. Part of the baboon\u2019s success is their strong social network, their unfussy diet and behavioural adaptability. In urban settings like Cape Town, baboons appear to have honed their raiding skills, zipping into densely populated areas to steal high-value human foodstuffs.      A male baboon raids a restaurant bin in Cape Town, South Africa. Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images    Similarly, the Barbary macaques of Gibraltar, emboldened by their friendly contact with tourists, have been carrying out forays further into human territory, raiding dustbins and running amok. Black bears in Nevada also do well out of garbage, with urban bears far less active yet far heavier than their wild counterparts. Even carnivores, it seems, can survive the big city, though they are probably benefitting from the abundance of rats and other rodents (which make up almost half their diet) rather than human food. In Chicago, researchers conducting the largest urban study of coyotes in the world have found these animals are more active at night, which brings them into less frequent contact with humans and traffic.  Other species have come up with different solutions to city life. There\u2019s good evidence, for instance, that urban great tits deliver their songs faster and at a higher pitch so they can be heard above the hectic soundscape. In Belo Horizonte in Brazil, black-tufted marmosets have altered their sleeping habits, carefully selecting trees that domestic cats cannot easily climb.  In short, there are still plenty of city-dwelling species to protect. But how can we make our cities more inviting places for these and other creatures \u2013 and, to put it bluntly, why should we bother?  Goddard is unequivocal. \u201cIf cities are to support a burgeoning human population, the maintenance of functioning urban ecosystems and the plethora of services they provide will be imperative for human health and well-being,\u201d he says. It is widely acknowledged that cities with some kind of functioning ecosystem make for better places for humans to live. Certainly, less green and more grey can often result in an increase in pollution and flooding. But more plants and animals in cities also make for happier, healthier people.  A study conducted on green spaces in Sheffield, for instance, revealed that the greater the biodiversity, the greater the psychological well-being of the city\u2019s residents. Over in Paris, researchers found that getting city-dwellers to take part in day-long activities involving urban wildlife opened their eyes to the natural world (for a time, at least). Few cities have been tangling with urban ecology for as long as Berlin. Slow economic recovery after the second world war meant that reconstruction took a long time. This provided local ecologists with the ideal conditions to develop an ambitious ecological research programme in the bombed-out wastelands of West Berlin, says Jens Lachmund, a sociologist at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands and the author of Greening Berlin: the Co-production of Science, Politics, and Urban Nature. The pioneering work in Berlin had several consequences, notably the formation of significant natural spaces within the city, such as the S\u00fcdgel\u00e4nde Nature Park. \u201cBerlin has indeed benefitted a lot from being a case study in urban ecology,\u201d says Lachmund.     A coyote on a suburban pavement in Chicago. Photograph: E Jason Wambsgans/MCT via Getty Images    The proximity of a city to a national park or other protected area is also likely to make it more species rich. With the Nairobi National Park just a few miles from the city centre, Kenya\u2019s capital boasts more than 300 species of bird. Likewise, there\u2019s Table Mountain National Park on the outskirts of Cape Town, the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in the centre of Mumbai, the Saguaro National Park just outside Tuscon, Arizona and the National City Park in Stockholm. The recent research conducted by Goddard and his colleagues confirms the importance of natural spaces within an urban setting. Essentially, the greener the city, the greater the proportion of native biodiversity that is retained.  \u201cThe key message from this work is very simple,\u201d says Goddard. \u201cThe protection of existing green spaces and the creation of new habitats is essential for supporting wildlife in cities. How we actually do this is more challenging, and will require collaboration between scientists, urban planners and habitat managers.\u201d Over the last decade, there have been some significant milestones on the way to figuring out the answers. In 2006, a number of pioneering city governments, from Curitiba to Joondalup, got behind Local Action for Biodiversity, a programme \u201caimed at improving and enhancing ecosystem management at the local level\u201d.  In 2008, the parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity began developing the City Biodiversity Index, a protocol for the evaluation of urban wildlife. Then, in 2012, the CBD launched Cities and Biodiversity Outlook, an effort to provide \u201ca global assessment of the links between urbanisation, biodiversity and ecosystem services\u201d. Cities take up just 3% of the terrestrial surface area, yet according to the most recent estimate from the United Nations, some 3.6 billion people (just over 50% of the global population) now live in urban areas. By 2050, this figure is projected to have risen to 6.3 billion. Without animals and birds to keep us company, it is a bleak prospect. \u2022 Birmingham joins San Francisco and Oslo in global green cities club"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/14/school-trips-new-york-educational-arms-race-parents", "sentences": ["Under the results rolled a few examples: pupils in Weybridge paying three grand for a biology trip to South Africa; others in Cheshire handing \u00a31,500 for skiing in Austria; Essex students going on a sports tour of Malaysia and Singapore for over \u00a32,000."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-14T19:00:00Z", "title": "Why school trips to New York mean an educational arms race for parents | Aditya Chakrabortty", "tags": ["School trips", "Schools", "Education", "Private schools", "Teaching"], "article": "In the front room of his house, Nigel is telling me how he fell victim to a parental ambush. Last autumn, his eldest son Robert came home from comprehensive school carrying a formulaic note about an outing. Only, this was no traipse around a museum or rain-sodden week up a mountain. To help with A-level economics, the school was organising a trip to New York, featuring a tour of Wall Street. With meals, subway fares and a bit of spending money, the 16-year-old&apos;s economics lesson would cost over \u00a31,200. All his parents had to do was sign a form. I wish whoever wrote that letter had met Nigel and his wife first. I&apos;ve known them for years: Cameron&apos;s strivers avant la lettre, they&apos;ve nevertheless been knocked about during the slump and are only now coming out of a financial rough patch. Then there are Robert&apos;s brothers and sisters (names have been changed), all speedily working their way through uniforms and school dinners. Forget exotic holidays; this is a family that watches what it spends at Asda. Even so, Nigel found himself cornered into handing over well over a grand for a school tour. &quot;Wherever I went in the house \u2013 the kitchen, the bathroom \u2013 I kept hearing about it: in the kitchen, in the bathroom.&quot; But the clincher was this: &quot;It sounded like a good opportunity, and I didn&apos;t want Robert to miss\u00a0out.&quot; Imagine the combination of pressure and guilt gnawing away at that father. Your child&apos;s teacher sends a letter recommending a trip you&apos;d never asked for and that you&apos;re not comfortable paying for. Stumping up means big cuts elsewhere. But refusal means coming off like a bad parent, and your child feeling left out and possibly being put at disadvantage at school. What would you do? Actually, I already have a fair idea. In February, this paper commissioned a poll of 1,000 families that showed over one in five had been asked by their child&apos;s school to pay for trips costing \u00a31,000 or more. Although 70% thought the request unacceptable, 47% still paid up. Under the results rolled a few examples: pupils in Weybridge paying three grand for a biology trip to South Africa; others in Cheshire handing \u00a31,500 for skiing in Austria; Essex students going on a sports tour of Malaysia and Singapore for over \u00a32,000. Each sounds like a steroidal package holiday, the difference being that the cost for one teenager is only just under that for an entire family getaway. Schools justify the trips in strikingly similar terms: they offer enriching experiences, mainly out of term time and for which the children can raise their own funds (although the fees are ultimately underwritten by parents). Fair enough,\u00a0but they surely also arm the sixth-formers with precious extra sentences for those Ucas forms, and give headteachers something to boast about on open days. Indeed, the website for Robert&apos;s state school, Highlands in Winchmore Hill, north London, is currently trumpeting an imminent trip to villages in Zambia. When I first started looking into this phenomenon, I wondered if it was any more than a few schools turning themselves into ersatz travel agents. Then I came across the various parenting websites with their message boards lit up by whether there ought to be a cap on how much school trips cost. The company running the Highlands Zambia trip, Schools Worldwide, told me that where state schools used to comprise a third of its customers, they now make up two-thirds. General manager Adam Hickman tells me that there is a booming cottage industry in offering one&apos;s services as a &quot;freelance school expedition leader&quot;: a job title tailormade for self-employed status-conscious Cameroonians. Even if we ascribe nothing but the purest motives to the individual institutions that lay on such trips, collectively they are enrolling parents into yet another educational arms race for the sake of their children. The classic definition of an arms race, don&apos;t forget, is one in which everyone spends, and frets, and watches the competition, but in the end hardly any players swap position. The money is essentially wasted, yet no parent can safely quit the arms race alone. A school in a well-off area, such as Highlands, seeks to prove it is no &quot;bog-standard comprehensive&quot;, by apeing private schools and laying on ever-more elaborate trips, as well as expensive activities after class, in a bid to get their kids into the good Russell Group universities. A school head on the opposite, poorer end of the borough to Highlands will be forced to offer his or her own extras, albeit not as costly. Meanwhile the private schools find ever-more exotic ways to siphon off their parents&apos; cash. Flick through the firms&apos; brochures and you&apos;ll see sociological field trips to Morocco, geography expeditions to Iceland, cultural-studies tours of Delhi. And so the spiral continues \u2013 until, come 2040, a free school in Shenfield or another part of the stockbroker belt sends its A-level physics class off on a space mission with Branson. What makes this arms race especially bizarre is that it is happening during one of the biggest squeezes in living standards; when, as Citizens&apos; Advice pointed out last summer, one in four parents are borrowing to buy their children&apos;s school uniforms. Or perhaps you don&apos;t get one without the other. Robert shows me a few photos of his New York trip: shots of him outside the stock exchange; in Times Square. Of the four nights he and his schoolmates spent in the US, only one day was really for work. And no, he tells me, his school has never taken him to the Bank of England museum or to the London stock exchange. Did he enjoy himself? &quot;I did,&quot; he says, cautiously. &quot;But to be honest, I hoped it would have been a bit more related to what we were doing in class.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/16/morris-aza-obituary", "sentences": ["Morris&apos;s own career began in the British army film and photographic unit when he was posted to Singapore after the second world war."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-16T11:43:28Z", "title": "Morris Aza obituary", "tags": ["Theatre", "Stage", "Film"], "article": "My grandfather, Morris Aza, who has died aged 89, was a theatrical agent for more than 40 years and represented some of the top names in the entertainment world. He was born into a show-business family, the only son of Bert and Lillian Aza. Bert&apos;s career had begun on the music-hall stage in the comedy act the Aza Boys. He became an agent and represented the singer Gracie Fields until his death in 1953, when Lillian took over. Morris&apos;s uncle, Archie Pitt, the other Aza Boy and an impresario, was Gracie&apos;s first husband. Morris&apos;s own career began in the British army film and photographic unit when he was posted to Singapore after the second world war. While he was there, assisting a photography unit documenting Japanese PoWs, he was, he recalled, approached by a &quot;posh officer&apos;&quot; who asked if he was interested in photographing &quot;the supremo&quot;, Lord (Louis) Mountbatten, who turned up a few days later with his wife, Edwina, and his batman. All was going well until Morris noticed, to his horror and apparently in slow motion, a large, falling light stand heading straight for Mountbatten. Luckily, the great man shot out a hand, caught it, and said suavely: &quot;No harm done, eh, sergeant?&quot; Back in Britain, Mo had set up a photographic studio in the loft of his parents&apos; house, and it was here that he met Sheila Tafler, when she booked in with a friend to have her picture taken. Her brother was the actor Sydney Tafler and her brother-in-law was the film director Lewis Gilbert. Morris and Sheila married in 1948 and had two children. After the war Morris spent a number of years in the movie business as a production manager on films such as A Cry From the Streets (1958), Light Up the Sky (1960) and The 7th Dawn (1964), until he started out as an agent, representing the comedians Roy Hudd and Billy Dainty, the actors Derek Griffiths and Betty Driver, and many others. His associations with both Roy and Betty lasted more than 50 years until his retirement, aged 82. His first love, apart from Sheila, who died in 2006, was always the theatre. He witnessed many sensational first nights and was a good judge of productions and performances. Morris lived life to the full, travelling extensively in Europe, America and the far east and making regular tours with Sheila of Michelin-starred hotels and restaurants. He was predeceased by his daughter Gillian in 2009 and is survived by his son, Graham, his grandchildren, Poppy, Jack, George, Grace, Florence, Henry and me, and his four great-grandchildren."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-culture-blog/2014/apr/17/wordstorm-a-crucible-of-ideas-to-inspire-northern-territory-writers", "sentences": ["This also reflects the particularly national focus for Wordstorm 2014, given that it had become known as the Australasian Festival of Writing with regular participation from neighbouring countries such as East Timor, Indonesia and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-17T00:22:47Z", "title": "Wordstorm: a crucible of ideas to inspire Northern Territory writers", "tags": ["Books", "Festivals"], "article": "Writing comes to the fore in Darwin next month when the Northern Territory Writers\u2019 Centre\u2019s biennial Wordstorm writers\u2019 festival takes place. A three-day feast of local and visiting literary talent, it offers a thoughtful thematic framework for engaging with the current literary landscape, one which still holds a place for the printed word but which is also immersed in the digital realm. Overseeing Wordstorm is Panos Couros, executive director of the NT Writers\u2019 Centre, and heading into his first such festival at the helm.  Unlike past Wordstorm festival directors, Couros is not a writer. His own artistic background is in sound, film and performance, along with management roles at the Darwin festival, the Sydney-based Casula Powerhouse and Mardi Gras film festival. He says he tried to make &quot;a point of difference&quot; between Wordstorm and other writers&apos; festivals. Most, he says, start off with the writers: &quot;It\u2019s the particular identity of this or that writer that counts. I started off with ideas, and then matched those ideas with appropriate writers.&quot; Couros tried to settle on one idea to frame the festival but concluded &quot;there\u2019s more than one idea happening at the moment&quot;, and so Wordstorm spans seven key themes titled Adaptation, Digital Children, Graphic Fantasy, New Media Wars, the Liquid Page, Rock Words and It\u2019s Not Black and White. Enveloping and expanding on these themes will be 70 writers from interstate and across the Territory, including national luminaries such as Alexis Wright, Christos Tsiolkas, Andrew Bovell, Mark Mordue and local writers including Leonie Norrington, Marie Munkara, Nick Bland and Barry Jonsberg.  Over half of the festival\u2019s line-up come from the NT. &quot;I wanted to have it equal,&quot; Couros says, &quot;and then it just grew&quot;. Directly following the festival in Darwin is the one-day Enabling the Territory industry forum specifically for NT writers. Couros sought extra funding to host the event the day after Wordstorm 2014 closes. It will mean a marathon effort for him. The Wordstorm team is small; Couros calls it a &quot;do-it-yourself festival&quot;. It will also mean a more NT-wide writer turnout for Wordstorm. Buoyed by the buzz of the festival, NT writers will have the opportunity through Enabling the Territory to hear from and pitch to key literary agents.  Couros regards writers to be at the vanguard of culture. &quot;Our writers almost lead us culturally, or they have the propensity to lead us because we read their stuff and get influenced by it,&quot; says Couros. One of his main aspirations for Wordstorm is that the festival can influence its writers.  &quot;What I\u2019m really hoping for is that these writers who come here really have fantastic dialogue with each other around the seven themes. If they go away and start writing, and their writing gets changed by what\u2019s happened at the festival, then I would consider the aim of the festival has been achieved.&quot; Couros has two favourite themes from Wordstorm 2014: the Liquid Page and It\u2019s Not Black and White. The Liquid Page program focuses on platforms which share and collectively shape narrative, and includes a crowd-writing panel session, and the Memory Makes Us event, brought to the festival by Simon Groth and his if: book Australia publishing venture. In this live writing event, Darwin authors Levin Diatschenko, Munkara and Kamarra Bell-Wykes will endeavour to create a new work based on written contributions from the public in response to the notion of &quot;dreams, dreaming and the sense of smell&quot;. A live &quot;#liquidpage&quot; collaborative digital writing site will also be active during Wordstorm \u2013amassing, morphing and recreating the written feedback from festival writers and audience (onsite and online) alike.  Writers such as Tsiolkas, Wright and Munkara along with Lionel Fogarty, Annette Shun Wah, Chi Vu and Antony Lowenstein will address the theme of It&apos;s Not Black and White. &quot;The idea,&quot;says Couros, &quot;is that people from Aboriginal cultures and people from non-Anglo migrant cultures have never really connected, or that connection was always dictated by an Anglo centre.&quot; In setting this thematic focus, Couros hopes to shift that centre and engender more dialogue from this perspective. This also reflects the particularly national focus for Wordstorm 2014, given that it had become known as the Australasian Festival of Writing with regular participation from neighbouring countries such as East Timor, Indonesia and Singapore. &quot;We always focus on looking out,&quot; says Couros, &quot;and often to the detriment of our own cultural development. Sometimes we just need to look at what we\u2019ve got before we look elsewhere.&quot;  Wordstorm takes place 29 May -1 June  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/9500-worth-gold-removed-indian-mans-intestines-singapore-customs-duty", "sentences": ["The businessman told the doctors he had swallowed the nuggets 10 days before in Singapore to avoid customs duties."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-18T11:49:45Z", "title": "\u00a39,500 worth of gold removed from Indian man's small intestines", "tags": ["India", "World news"], "article": "Doctors in India have discovered 12 gold nuggets in the stomach of a wealthy businessman, according to local reports.

Trucks still rumble down the potholed road through the town but the last workers have long gone home, walking past the furled awnings of the market stalls, over the single footbridge, along the battered pavements, to the tenement apartments, the squalid huts, the\u00a0tin-roofed homes by the fetid pond. Then, as light comes, the silence is broken: water splashes into a bucket held under a standpipe by a child, a pressure cooker wails, someone laughs. In thousands of homes, tens of thousands of people are scooping rice and vegetables from tin bowls, packing the leftovers to eat during the long day ahead and then, hands rinsed, goodbyes said, filing out into the streets, the streams of workers uniting and then separating as they flow through the town, like blood through veins, each leading to a different factory. In the evening the flow will reverse, the pulse slower, less certain. But now, at\u00a07.30am, it is sure and steady. On this morning, 23 April last year and the day before the disaster, the workers at the five factories housed in the eight-storey Rana Plaza arrive as usual around 7.45am. There are 2,200 registered employees in the complex, plus those who staff the bank and the shops on the first floor. Once through the doors at the rear, they head up the narrow stairs to their workplaces: New Wave Bottoms on the second floor, Phantom Apparels on the third, Phantom Tac on the fourth, then Ether Tex and finally New Wave Style on the sixth and seventh floors. For several years now, these five companies have produced millions of items of clothing for western clients including Matalan and Primark. Among the workers is Mahmuda Akhter. Her husband, Habibullah, works in the Phantom Tac factory a floor above, and as usual the couple have walked to work together, leaving their baby girl at\u00a0home with Mahmuda&apos;s mother. They are from a small village in Pabna district 100 miles from Savar. Unusually for conservative Bangladesh, theirs is a &quot;love marriage&quot;, not arranged by their parents. Mahmuda is 20; Habibullah, 23. Mahmuda reaches her sewing machine and sits\u00a0down. A few yards away is Shapla Begum, a\u00a0supervisor working on another of the three lines, each of around 80 sewing machine operators, that constitute Phantom Apparels. Shapla is 27 and has been in Savar for five years. She, too, is a migrant. Her husband&apos;s earnings as a rickshaw puller in their village in Kurigram in the distant north were insufficient to pay for schooling for their two boys so, following other relatives, they came to Savar. Working for Ether Tex on the fifth floor are Runarini and her two daughters. Runarini is a\u00a0&quot;helper&quot;, cleaning and carrying, as is the younger of the two girls, Preity, who is 15. The elder, 18-year-old Shamapati, a serious girl who laughs rarely, says little and works hard, is a\u00a0sewing machine operator. The trio have arrived in Savar more recently than most of their colleagues and so can afford only a single room in\u00a0a battered, tin-roofed shack. They hope that in time they will find something better. The open yard full of chickens and children in front of their new home reminds Preity of the fields and trees she left behind, and of the friends she misses.

Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    But she likes Shonjit Das, the 19-year-old son of\u00a0her immediate neighbour. He works in the finishing section of Ether Tex, packing the clothes to be sent off to the west, and is handsome and funny, and sometimes walks her home at the end of the day. And she knows the three women are earning many times what labouring in others&apos; fields or cultivating their own poor, eroded land back in their village would ever have paid. At 8am, as every morning except Sundays, in all the factories, on every floor of the Rana Plaza, the bell sounds, conversation ends and work starts. No one is entirely sure how big the global clothing industry is, what profit it makes or how many it employs. It is estimated that $300bn worth of clothes were made by the top 10 producers in 2012, and the industry as a whole generates revenues of between $500m and $2tn. But no one really knows. Textiles, if not garments, have always been a\u00a0key element of global commerce. For more than a thousand years, trade between Europe and east Asia travelled what were known as the &quot;silk routes&quot;. Later, the textile industry played an important role in Britain&apos;s emergence as the world&apos;s leading commercial power. There and elsewhere, the rag trade employed millions and created immense wealth, playing a key role in the transition of western nations from agrarian to industrial economies. But nothing really compares with what is happening today, either in scale or in impact. For as the west has got richer, its demand for clothes has steadily risen. Garment-making is labour-intensive and there is often little room for savings on the textiles that are the biggest single cost. This means the price of a human being cutting, making and trimming a garment is key in the overall production costs and, of course, eventual profits. Through the 50s and 60s, producers hunted cheaper labour in east Asia \u2013 first Japan and then, in the 70s and 80s, in the so-called Asian Tiger economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Employment in the garment manufacturing industry in the west has declined steadily decade on decade \u2013 despite attempts to protect local industries with quota systems and tariffs. Production in newly industrialised China, as well as in Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico and India, has increased exponentially. For the consumer, of course, this has all meant that while prices of everything else except communications have risen, clothes cost less. In 1900, 15% of a US household&apos;s income was spent on clothing. In 1950, it was still 12%. Even as late as the early 1990s, major purchases of clothing \u2013 a\u00a0suit, a dress, a coat \u2013 marked a special occasion or a rite of passage. But by 2004, the total amount spent by households on clothes had dropped to just 4%. By 2010, according to the US Bureau of Labour Statistics, clothing cost the average American family only $1,700 (\u00a31,017), 2.8% of their income. And for that money the consumer gets much more. Cheap no longer means nasty; it just means affordable. In 1997, the average woman in\u00a0the UK bought 19 items of clothing a year; in\u00a02007, she bought 34. The big bang in recent textile history came in a few short years at the beginning of the last decade, when various factors coincided to change radically the nature and scale of garment production around the planet. One was the end of the quota system put in place 30 years earlier to protect western industries. A second was a\u00a0new degree of\u00a0conformity of tastes across the world, allowing greater uniformity of product and bigger volumes of single designs. A third was &quot;fast fashion&quot;.     Volunteers and rescue workers search the rubble for trapped factory employees. Photograph: Palash Khan/Sipa USA /REX    Fast fashion is at once a mode of production, a\u00a0strategy and a style. It grew out of the efforts of\u00a0the major western brands, which dominate garment sales, to find new ways to coax further demand out of a saturated market. Though soon adopted by retailers across the world, it was pioneered by Inditex, the giant Spanish company that owns Zara. It depends on a\u00a0series of mutually reinforcing innovations: an accelerated cycle of design, production and supply that means trends can be spotted, copied and sold within weeks; no &quot;seasons&quot;, but a year-round product flow; low stock levels in stores to encourage rapid, repeated impulse purchases; a\u00a0supply chain that can respond when shop staff notice that shoppers suddenly seem to like lace, or blue, or diamond patterns, or a particular stitching on their socks, or whatever; huge numbers of young adults for whom shopping is the primary leisure activity; a\u00a0new obsession with celebrities, fuelled by social media and the internet; and, of course, low prices. Sourcing has thus become a complex operation in which scores of different factors \u2013 cost, location, eventual market, risk, competition, styling, quality and so on \u2013 are computed to decide on an\u00a0eventual place of production. Basic clothing \u2013 socks, for example \u2013 will be ordered in huge quantities with long lead times. Higher quality workmanship will be done in Europe, north Africa or, for the US market, Latin America. More fashion-led items are often needed in smaller quantities but faster. And cost, whatever the brands say, is always the prime consideration. So\u00a0in this highly networked system, places where suppliers can turn around vast quantities of clothing very rapidly and very cheaply are key. Places where you can order, say, 500,000 basic shirts, paying $6 per piece, and they will be shipped on time, with minimum fuss, and be in stores, retailing for $30, within, at the outside, two to three months. Places such as Bangladesh. Mahmuda and her husband are standing in a crowd of workers outside the Rana Plaza complex. They have been there for nearly 40\u00a0minutes and now 2,000 people are massed around the building. Shapla is there, too, and Preity, her mother and sister, and Shonjit, her 19-year-old friend. There is\u00a0a low murmur of discontent and concern. It is 24 April. The previous day, shortly after work started, three cracks were found in the reinforced concrete pillars that support the eight-storey building. An engineer sent by the Savar municipality declared the building unsafe, work in the five factories was halted and everyone was sent home. Mahmuda&apos;s job is to stitch seams and pockets. It is one of the tougher of the 60 or 70 separate operations needed to make a pair of trousers. She is supposed to stitch 120 pairs an hour, 10 hours a day, six days a week, 50 weeks of the year. That&apos;s 360,000 annually. She earns 8,000BDT (\u00a360) each month. Her husband, a quality controller, earns a little more. Each line in Mahmuda&apos;s factory is watched over by three supervisors. Shapla is one of only a handful who are women. She is paid 10,000BDT (\u00a375) for monitoring the 15 workers and five helpers on her section, but gets no overtime. The line&apos;s target and their progress is indicated on a board hung on the wall above the output bins where the finished clothes are dropped. The workers get an hour off for lunch. The boss &quot;is a\u00a0well-mannered person&quot; and there are no complaints, or at least not from Shapla&apos;s section. If an order is delivered late, accepted practice in much of the industry is for the buyer to deduct 5% for each week of delay. The buyers already have political unrest, wildcat strikes and blockades to deal with; they cannot afford to risk losing further days of production. And that is what they are facing now.     Satyadip lost his 19-year-old son, Shonjit, in the building collapse. Photograph: David Levene  for the Guardian    Which may explain how, somehow, overnight, the cracks that shut the factory the day before have become less dangerous and the management has called in the workforce. The building has been inspected once more and is safe, they say. Monthly salaries are due in 10 days, but overtime, which increases most employees&apos; salaries by between a\u00a0third and\u00a0a\u00a0half, and means being able to pay the rent\u00a0or eat properly, will be paid in the next day or so. Many of the workers are told by their managers that unless they work, they will not receive the money. What choice have we got, the workers are saying to each other. We are here to work, after all. The managers know this. They know, too, that, as a female supervisor, Shapla is trusted more than her male counterparts, and not just by &quot;her girls&quot;. So when they want the workers to stop shouting and calm down, and to enter the building, take their places at their machines and finish the big orders the factories are currently under pressure to complete on time, several come to her, telling her again how the building is safe, how the girls trust her, how if she doesn&apos;t go in, the girls won&apos;t either. She is uncertain, reluctant, but because at that moment it is the easiest thing to do, she gives way and goes in. And her girls follow. Similar pressure has been put on other supervisors. They, too, reluctantly head into the\u00a0building. Soon all the workers are flowing up the stairs. Mahmuda leaves her husband in the stairwell. He carries on up to his factory. She makes her way to her desk and machine on the third floor. On the fifth floor, in the Ether Tex factory, 15-year-old Preity, her mother and her sister are working by 8.30am. Preity is on her feet, moving up and down the line, clearing offcuts, bringing new needles or thread; her mother is nearby, her sister working at a sewing machine on the same line but at the opposite end of the room. Mahmuda has time to stitch maybe two or three pieces before the lights go out, the old fans, which barely dent the heat in the factory, slow and the sewing machines stop. A power cut, frequent enough and no cause for alarm. The workers wait in the gloom, talking quietly, worried, waiting for the powerful, heavy generators installed on the roof to start up. Moments after the generators start, sending vibrations through the building, a pillar in one corner of the Rana Plaza gives way with a loud, explosive bang. Then each storey slides sideways, tips and splits, falling in on the one below. On the third floor, the collapse is almost instantaneous, but the workers of Phantom Apparels still have time to realise what is happening. The floor starts shaking and it is clear the building is coming down. Mahmuda starts reciting verses of the Qur&apos;an. She staggers, falls and crawls beneath her sewing machine. Shapla is walking down her line when the building starts to collapse. She starts running. She, too, seeks protection under a sewing machine and then everything gives way around her. She is in darkness, gasping for breath. Two floors above, the floor inclines slowly like the deck of a sinking ship. Panicked workers rush to the two narrow exits. It is dark, there is much dust and noise. Runarini has managed to find her youngest daughter, Preity, and is now trying to get to the other end of her line where Shamapati, her eldest, was working at her machine. But the force of bodies pushes her towards the exit. She cannot hold on to Preity and fight the crowd to find Shamapati. The floor lurches, tips again and everything falls. In the darkness after the collapse there are many voices: sobs, sustained screaming, calls for help and water, moans of pain, prayers, howls of grief. Some are trapped in total darkness, others can make out some light. Many are pinned down by huge blocks of concrete, bent iron girders, machinery. Others are entombed in small cavities. Some are alone, others with colleagues or strangers from other floors. Shapla can move her hand but nothing else. Mahmuda can see the sky through a gap in the wall several yards away. Runarini and Preity are trapped together and they can hear voices, but not Shamapati&apos;s. They shout her name, but there is no response. Outside there is chaos. Dazed survivors stand immobile in a huge, roiling cloud of dust. It takes time for Dhaka&apos;s ramshackle emergency services to arrive, so hundreds of locals clamber over and through the rubble, tearing at the concrete blocks and mangled metal with their hands. Soon corpses are lined up on the ground, limbs limp and twisted, as if they had fallen from a\u00a0great height. Mahmuda crawls towards the light, finds herself only a few metres from the ground and clambers down. She cannot see her husband. Shapla waits longer for rescue. She can hear sirens and shouts outside. They are hammering and drilling the slab of concrete above her. She finds her throat so dry from screaming that she cannot talk when the rescuers find her. She is unaware that she has made any noise whatsoever. It takes two hours to free her. Runarini and Preity crawl together towards a\u00a0shaft of light and are lifted from the rubble by mid-afternoon. The ruined building is now surrounded by police and soldiers, and heavy lifting equipment is arriving. There are electric saws and jackhammers, and lines of ambulances. There is no sign of Shamapati. Bangladesh is the original &quot;basket case&quot;, a term coined by Henry Kissinger, the US secretary of state, to describe the country immediately after its violent secession from Pakistan in 1971. Up to 3\u00a0million died in that conflict, a civil war that was simultaneously a war of independence, and its wounds remain livid. Famine, flood, a massive programme of nationalisation, political instability and further violence crippled the new nation&apos;s economy. But, despite the continual challenges, the textiles and garment industry prospered. Investment and advice from Korean companies helped and, by the end of the 1990s, the industry had somehow weathered destructive storms \u2013 political, economic and meteorological. In 2004, when the protectionist quotas that had been imposed to protect western jobs 30 years earlier expired, many in Bangladesh were apprehensive. But the industry boomed. &quot;Business just took off,&quot; says Rubana Huq, now managing director of garment manufacturers the Mohammadi Group. In 2004 there were 2 million workers in Bangladesh&apos;s 4,000 factories, with exports worth $6bn. Nine years later, there were twice as many in 5,600 registered establishments, sending $21bn worth of clothes overseas. Competition from abroad when the quotas disappeared meant &quot;prices dipped&quot;, Huq says, but the demand from Europe and the US was so great that she and others &quot;just kept on building&quot;. If wages in Bangladesh remained the lowest in the world, land prices in central Dhaka, where most of\u00a0the garment businesses were based, rose so fast that new investors sought space on the margins of\u00a0the city where hastily reclaimed wetlands could still be bought relatively cheaply. In Savar, Gazipur, Ashulia and elsewhere around Dhaka, hundreds of factories went up every year. There was little or no planning or regulation. &quot;People were not much concerned by building codes or quality of material,&quot; admits Emdadul Islam, the long-serving chief engineer of Rajuk, Dhaka&apos;s development authority. Monitoring of environmental impact, construction quality and permits for the millions flowing in from rural areas were almost nonexistent. Inevitably, people started to die. In April 2005, a factory in Savar called Spectrum collapsed, killing 64 workers. The dead were making clothes for western retailers. Poor cement was a likely cause \u2013 builders often charge for better-quality materials than they deliver \u2013 or water from a nearby canal may have washed out foundations. For a short period there was talk of a crackdown on unsafe buildings, but even though a second factory in northern Dhaka collapsed a year later, killing 21, the fuss faded. As the recession hit western economies in 2008 and 2009, brands forced down prices even further as they negotiated with suppliers. Those in Bangladesh who demanded government intervention in one of the country&apos;s few economic success stories made little headway when dozens of garment factory owners sat in parliament and powerful industry bodies had the ear of policymakers. The\u00a0boom continued. Bangladesh, the world&apos;s 76th biggest exporter of clothes in 1980, was the eighth biggest in 2006, and by 2013 was second only to China. Over the decade, prompted by a string of reports of child labour and other abuses in factories around the world, the brands had set up systems to monitor pay and working conditions in their supply chain. Some organised their own inspections, many brought in contractors. But executives did not think to undertake structural surveys of the buildings where their clothes were made. Instead,\u00a0they relied on the corrupt, poorly paid, underqualified, undermanned local authorities. This, senior executives at major European brands now admit, was a mistake. Others use stronger terms. From 2005 to March 2013, fires killed an estimated 600, but no more buildings collapsed. The Dhaka suburb of Gulshan is only 15 miles from Savar. Rickshaws negotiate its quiet, tree-lined streets with relative ease and there are many good restaurants. In the late morning, coffee shops are busy with staff from international NGOs and the UN. This is where the Bangladesh operations of many big European and US brands are based, as are the larger buyers who often act as their intermediaries locally.     Fifteen-year-old Preity and her mother managed to escape from the building; her 18-year-old sister Shamapati didn\u2019t make it out. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    The offices of H&amp;M occupy a new five-storey block. There is nothing to distinguish the building, inside or out, from its counterparts in\u00a0any western capital. On the walls of brightly\u00a0lit\u00a0meeting rooms \u2013 each named after garment manufacturing zones around the city \u2013 are posters of laughing, thin, beautiful young Europeans of varying ethnic backgrounds wearing the bright, cheery, fashionable clothes of\u00a0the company&apos;s brands. A\u00a0notice tells staff: &quot;Your passionate focus towards quality will make it happen.&quot; H&amp;M, which has 3,000 stores in around 50 markets worldwide and sales of \u00a313bn in 2012 (making a profit of \u00a31.6bn), has been in Bangladesh since the early 80s and is one of the biggest foreign brands working in the country. The\u00a0Swedish retailer did not have any contracts with the factories working in Rana Plaza, nor any link to the building, and has long been at the forefront of efforts to find a way to improve pay and working conditions in the industry. These have intensified since last April&apos;s tragedy, but &quot;there&apos;s a lot more to the country for us than low wages and low costs&quot;, says Anna Gedda, the company&apos;s social sustainability manager. Executives from other big brands all make similar points when talking about the Rana Plaza collapse, even if their companies have been less proactive than H&amp;M. They express their shock and grief, say they have long recognised the problems in Bangladesh, point out that the chaotic environment of a developing world city means many issues are partly beyond their control (though, they admit, still their responsibility), and downplay the significance of cheap labour in the decision to locate production in the country. They also emphasise the importance of the garment industry to the Bangladeshi economy and the social transformation brought about by the employment of millions of young, rural women, albeit in poorly paid, monotonous jobs. One company spokesman points out that otherwise &quot;these women would be in the fields, in ship-breaking or shrimp farming, working as maids&quot;. Now, he says, they are breadwinners, independent, and often with the means to pay for\u00a0their kids to go to school. H&amp;M&apos;s Gedda says: &quot;The best way for the country is for brands like H&amp;M to stay there.&quot; This is something one hears frequently: from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, senior ministers, international trade unionists, independent economists and urban development specialists in Dhaka. It&apos;s also what all the workers say. Everyone agrees that the Rana Plaza collapse was a &quot;wake-up call&quot; that will be &quot;a turning point&quot;, but they all say the industry and the brands must remain. &quot;If there is a pull-out, it will be a catastrophe for Dhaka,&quot; says Professor Nazrul Islam, of the local Centre for Urban Studies. The result, after a series of fairly acrimonious meetings in Geneva and Paris last year, is three separate initiatives: the Accord, which involves more than 150 largely European brands; the Alliance, set up by US brands; and a joint effort by the UN and the Bangladeshi government. Between them, these three are meant to bring all the factories in Bangladesh into a system of auditing and inspection that will enforce agreed standards. They will also, theoretically, ensure structural surveys. The brands will help pay for improvements needed by their suppliers to meet the new standards \u2013 through grants in the case of\u00a0the legally binding Accord and soft loans for the less constraining Alliance \u2013 and there are also provisions for strengthening the country&apos;s underdeveloped and highly politicised unions. There is a separate process designed to establish how much compensation will be paid \u2013 the total could be more than $40m \u2013 to the Rana Plaza victims. Many brands have refused to become involved and international trade unionists admit the current initiatives have many flaws. Nonetheless, they say, taken together the package\u00a0represents &quot;an unprecedented chance to\u00a0put all this right&quot;. Some specialists even hope that initiatives will\u00a0provide a model not just in Bangladesh but in\u00a0Cambodia, Indonesia, Latin America and even the emerging new markets for production such as\u00a0Burma and Ethiopia. The risk, of course, is that\u00a0attention will fade, as it did after the 2005 Spectrum factory collapse. &quot;This is Plan B,&quot; says\u00a0Srinivas Reddy, the Bangladesh country director of the International Labour Organisation. Plan A led to Rana Plaza. There is no Plan C. If, from afar, the world of the garment workers and the garment industry in Bangladesh is one of\u00a0stark contrasts, up close it is one of shadows and ambiguity. Mohammadpur, for example, is a\u00a0designated slum that is also a booming new neighbourhood on the\u00a0western margins of a city that has no legal boundaries. A few decades ago it\u00a0was wetland like Savar or Gazipur. By the 90s, the marshes had been replaced by rows of wooden sheds on stilts full of\u00a0half-starved labourers and their families. Now it is changing again as Dhaka, a city of at least 15\u00a0million, gets steadily less poor. The wooden shacks have been replaced by cement apartments and rooms. There are tea stalls with TVs tuned to the Discovery Channel, schools, shops and a refurbished mosque. &quot;It&apos;s better than where I came from\u2026 At least there&apos;s a\u00a0chance of making a living here, of a better life, perhaps,&quot; says Salahuddin, a 27-year-old labourer who fled poverty, debt and failing yields on a tiny parcel of land to bring his family to the city. But if it is possible to see incremental and uneven progress in Dhaka, there is also misery, overcrowding, disease, crime and failing infrastructure. Police rarely venture into Mohammadpur. A fire in a garment factory here killed seven in 2013 and fear of such accidents is one reason Salahuddin&apos;s wife, Juleika, prefers poorly paid work as a maid. The dirt roads are strewn with rubbish. Water from standpipes is sold at extortionate prices by landlords in league with local politicians and bureaucrats. There is the perpetual risk of eviction and demolition. In the brutal summer heat, the concrete boxes where entire families live are furnaces. Then there is Bangladesh. It is one of the &quot;Next 11&quot; nations seen by Goldman Sachs as having the potential to take off as major economies. Its development indicators have risen steadily, to the\u00a0point where most are now better than those in neighbouring India. But again, if the rate of population growth has dropped in recent years, it is still high. Flooding and extreme weather events linked to climate change threaten disasters in the future in this low-lying land. The flow from the countryside to the cities is unlikely to slow soon, and, as the effluent from the factories contaminates the once pristine waterways, so toxic politics and endemic graft poison public life.     Of 20 women Shapla supervised in the building, 19\u00a0died.  Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    And what of the garment industry&apos;s role in all of this? Along with remittances from workers overseas, the industry is the only major foreign currency earner for the country. Wages for workers have risen since the disaster \u2013 the minimum monthly salary for an entry-level worker is now 5,300BDT (about \u00a340) a month \u2013 but so have rents, and no one can pretend a family can live on a single salary. Factory conditions might have improved in the last decade, but even without the 1,130 who died in Rana Plaza, the toll from fires and other accidents would be intolerable. Along with the 4\u00a0million directly employed by the industry, economists say there are another 4\u00a0million people whose livelihoods depend on the\u00a0internal demand it generates. If half of these 8\u00a0million people support a family of five, then around a sixth of the population depends on people several thousands miles away buying cheap clothes that they don&apos;t need. And that means this world of ambiguity is one the consumer inhabits, too. Many debate where the blame lies for tragedies such as Rana Plaza, and argue over who has the responsibility to prevent them in the future. The owners of the factories? Those who let the buildings that house the workshops? The crooked builders? The bent bureaucrats? The government? The intermediaries who do so much of the buying? The brands? Some western brands implicitly accept a degree of moral responsibility, even if their lawyers are careful to make sure their legal liability is strictly limited. &quot;People portray companies as evil by definition, and in many aspects they are. But often times a\u00a0company is forced to behave in certain ways by consumer behaviour. If no one buys your product, you are out of business. Consumers take decisions for companies, but often [they] don&apos;t, which means they don&apos;t care,&quot; says one senior executive at a big European high street brand. Though there is little statistical evidence of any\u00a0direct correlation between bad publicity about social issues and sales \u2013 it would, experts say, be almost impossible to establish such a link anyway \u2013 big companies do their own research to\u00a0understand the impact on sales of events such\u00a0as the Rana Plaza collapse. &quot;Companies do very precise work on this to\u00a0understand the consumers and what level of\u00a0quality they are willing to pay for, and [it shows that]\u00a0a large number of consumers prefer inexpensive over respect for human rights or environment,&quot; the executive says. &quot;After all, if you buy a pair of jeans at $9.99, what are you really expecting about the working conditions of\u00a0those who made them or even just the environment in which they live?&quot; Mahmuda eventually found her husband&apos;s body, intact but for a broken nose, laid out in the makeshift morgue set up in the grounds of a local school. It took some days for her to realise that her husband was not going to walk through the door of their small home in Savar. She returned to\u00a0her village to bury him, but life was as hard there as it had ever been and she was soon back in\u00a0Savar. Eight months later, Mahmuda started work at another garment factory, less than 300m from where the Rana Plaza complex stood. She passes the site of the collapse \u2013 the rubble scraped away, a trough of filthy water, scattered bolts of filthy cloth, a stench of decayed matter \u2013 every day. &quot;I\u00a0tell myself if one building has collapsed, it\u00a0doesn&apos;t mean they all will,&quot; she says. &quot;I can&apos;t be\u00a0scared. If I am scared, how will I\u00a0feed my family? I\u00a0tell myself if one building has collapsed, it doesn&apos;t mean they all will.&quot; Runarini, however, has still not fully understood that her daughter will not come home. Shamapati&apos;s remains have never been found. It is possible that the 18-year-old&apos;s corpse may have been buried with 250 others, all unidentified, in the chaotic aftermath of the collapse. There is even a chance that, unrecognisable and untested, it may have been given to the wrong family. Bangladesh&apos;s only DNA testing facility was unable to cope with so many dead, and officials admit mistakes were made. Preity still dreams of her village and misses her friends and school. Now she hopes to set up a\u00a0tailoring shop when she is older, with help from an NGO. &quot;My mum cries all the time,&quot; she says. She misses her sister, too, and Shonjit, who sometimes walked her back from the factory. He\u00a0was killed, too. When Shonjit&apos;s father, Satyadip, who still works as a loader in a nearby factory, heard of the collapse, he ran to the site. &quot;I was crazy. I tried to tear away the stones with my hands. For 13 days I\u00a0went there, round all the hospitals, to find him, to find my son. I held on to my hope, but then we found him and he was not with us any more.&quot; Rubana Huq, managing director of the Mohammadi Group, travelled to the site of the collapse when she heard what had happened, though she has no link to the factories there. She\u00a0set up a small relief operation and spent days handing out water and food to rescue workers. &quot;It\u00a0made me think differently about the workers; that it is another life, like mine,&quot; she says. Shapla has seen only one of the 20 girls she watched over since the day of the tragedy. She saw her, fleetingly, at a\u00a0bus stop. She has heard news of a second. The rest she believes are dead. Now, when she sees their children, she feels &quot;like a criminal&quot;. &quot;I was the one who got them to go in. I was the one they followed. I think about it all the time.&quot; Shapla has found a job at another factory but, due to her back injuries, as a sewing-machine operator, not a supervisor. She would prefer to do &quot;any other job&quot;, but the only alternative is manual labour on construction sites, building new factories and homes for workers, and she needs 10,000BDT (\u00a375) to get her son into a local school. Most of the victims have received money \u2013 some from the government, some from industry bodies, some from one or two brands, such as Primark, that have unilaterally decided to make\u00a0payments while most other brands, the government, global unions and industry bodies argue over the level of compensation they will eventually pay out. Every evening, Mahmuda, Satyadip, Shapla and approximately 4 million others in and around Dhaka stop work, exchange a few words with their colleagues and head home. They go out on to the broken, crowded streets, a stream of workers that flows together, then divides again round the stalls, the beggars, the lines of overloaded trucks, the packed buses immobile amid the rickshaws. They are joined by streams from other factories, flowing together before splitting again into smaller streams down the narrow lanes between the tenements, until these, too, eventually divide and divide once more, and it becomes dark, and the workers are home. \u2022 We Are What We Wear: Unravelling Fast Fashion And The Collapse Of Rana Plaza by Lucy Siegle and Jason Burke is published by Guardian Shorts (ebook, \u00a31.99/$2.99).

He was recently left in a wet bed for more than five hours. &quot;What can you do?&quot; Richard is divorced, his son lives in South America and his daughter is in Singapore. &quot;I would say I am entombed, imprisoned and isolated,&quot; Richard says. &quot;But how can I expect a community of strangers, with their own lives, to come to my rescue?&quot; The growing calamity that is social care is well known, but Richard&apos;s plight reveals a new crisis in the making. In Britain, relatives and friends provide \u00a355bn a year of unpaid informal care. However, according to The Generation Strain \u2013 a report to be published on Thursday by the IPPR thinktank \u2013 by 2017, for the first time, the number of older people in need of care is expected to outstrip the number of family members able and willing to give help. By 2032, 1.1 million older people in England will need care from their families, an increase of 60%, but the number of people able to care will only increase by 20%. Richard&apos;s plight will become more of the rule than the exception, unless the current system receives a major overhaul. &quot;Thousands of people could be left to cope on their own when they need care in the future, with overstretched services unable to make up the shortfall,&quot; says Clare McNeill, author of the report. Eight out of 10 local authorities now only fund &quot;critical&quot; need, while social care has faced cuts of 20%, with more to come. According to the Nuffield Trust, the NHS will require another \u00a330bn a year by 2020 for the social care bill. The Generation Strain report supports greater integration of health and social care, but also calls for more innovation to find alternative ways to fill the family care gap. In Leeds, one of 14 local authorities pioneering better health and social care integration, two pilots which were begun last summer but officially launched this month build on 22 years of community work. If successful and rolled out across the country, the scheme could save the NHS up to \u00a31bn a year in social care spending and put an end to the involuntary solitary confinement of thousands of older people like Richard. &quot;Our aim is tackling loneliness, the blight of the 21st century,&quot; says Adam Ogilvie, the Leeds Labour councillor who is leading the change to adult social care. Mick Ward, head of adult social care \u2013 debonair in silver shoes and blue bow tie \u2013 fizzes as he describes the core philosophy of the changes. Older people are seen not as a set of expensive problems but as enterprising people with gifts and assets that can be utilised to improve their communities. Their basic practical requirements \u2013 washing, dressing, eating \u2013 are assessed by social services, as has always been the case, but crucially under the new scheme a community planner also visits and works with the person to give back to him or her an active life. The individual&apos;s personal budget, used to buy care, is pooled, managed by the centre, stretching resources further. Caroline, a former social worker, and Sarah, an occupational therapist, job-share as community planners. &quot;Most people have a very simple need,&quot; Caroline says. &quot;They say, &apos;I don&apos;t want to be on my own any more&apos;.&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve always wanted to tackle isolation,&quot; adds Mick Ward. &quot;But for years I&apos;ve been swimming against the tide. Now we&apos;re riding a wave.&quot; Garforth Neighbourhood Elders Team (NET) is housed in a converted day centre and services 13 former pit villages. It is one of 37 centres locally organised and run by and for people aged 60 and over in Leeds. Garforth, established in 1995, now has more than 2,000 clients and 157 volunteers who give practical advice and support, and organise more than 50 events a week (armchair yoga, knitting and nattering). Eric Clayton, a retired factory worker and skilled carpenter, is 84. He looked after his wife for 16 years until she died four years ago. &quot;We&apos;d been married for 56 years,&quot; he says. &quot;When she died it was as if someone had taken out my brain.&quot; He stayed in the house alone for months. &quot;Then, one morning, I looked in the mirror and told myself: &apos;She&apos;d play hell if she saw you like this&apos;. So I shaved, put on a coat and went out. It was raining and cold. I came back soaking wet, but I felt alive again.&quot; Soon after, Eric joined the centre and met volunteer Brian Slack, 69, an ex-RAF man. Brian and Eric now have an outing every Wednesday. They belong to a men&apos;s group which has a regular pub lunch. Eric also volunteers to work on the centre&apos;s allotment, sings in the choir, and \u2013 with his friend, Jean Beasley, 83 \u2013 he is preparing for an afternoon event for people with dementia. They show me the sculptures that have been made. &quot;Everybody can do something,&quot; Jean says. At the centre, the immobile are helped, the housebound visited. &quot;Every time I walk in, I know I am going to have a good day today,&quot; Jean says. A time bank encourages local firms to give their time, and there are inter-generational links with local schools, including pupils with special needs teaching IT skills to older clients. A &quot;community connector&quot;, a trusted local person, is paid to spot the potentially lonely and to recruit older people with skills they want to share. One community connector put a &quot;whittler&quot;, a carver, in touch with a formerly isolated man. They now regularly chat and carve walking sticks. &quot;It&apos;s all about reciprocity,&quot; says Monica Walker, head of the centre. The aim is to reduce the number of emergency hospital admissions and the use of residential care, day centres and intensive home support, keeping older people involved and communities alive. Mick Ward, who also commissions social care, tells the story of a woman in her 60s who was admitted to A&amp;E seven times in two months, extremely agitated and ostensibly mentally ill. A member of the network visited her and discovered that she had been drinking 12 cans of Red Bull a day. The visit cost a fraction of the hundreds of pounds in A&amp;E admissions. &quot;I know which I prefer,&quot; he says. The scheme is financed not by government but by Big Society Capital, an independent financial institution investing in social ventures. The hope is a saving in the council&apos;s social care budget of between 5% to 10%. The savings will repay the interest on the Big Society Capital loan; a share will go to the council and a share reinvested in the neighbourhood networks. &quot;My daughters complain all the time,&quot; Eric says, cheerfully. &quot;They say I&apos;m never at home.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/20/britain-nation-of-makers-five-year-plan", "sentences": ["There are lessons to be learned from China and other east Asian economies such as Singapore and South Korea."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-19T23:04:06Z", "title": "If Britain wants to become a nation of makers, why not a five-year plan?", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Economic policy", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Economics", "Politics", "Vince Cable", "Barclays", "Business"], "article": "Britain&apos;s apparent love affair with China has intensified over recent months. George Osborne has on many occasions trotted out the need to strengthen the UK&apos;s economic and business ties with the world&apos;s second-biggest (and soon to be largest) economy. His trade visit last October was swiftly followed up two months later by David Cameron, who delayed the December autumn statement by a day because of a clash with his own trade mission. These trips and others have highlighted Britain&apos;s desire to look to the rapidly growing economies in the east for growth, moving away from a reliance on debt-fuelled spending and financial services and towards manufacturing and exports. Policymakers have recognised the scale of the task, after a steep decline in British manufacturing presided over by Margaret Thatcher and continuing under subsequent governments \u2013 including the Blair administration, when an opportunity to pump money into industry was missed. The heritage remains, of course, but many of the skills and much of the investment went abroad as manufacturing stagnated. We are left with an economy that is heavily reliant on services \u2013 accounting for three-quarters of gross domestic product \u2013 while manufacturing contributes around 10%. The government has not been short of words about the need to rebalance. Business secretary Vince Cable has published and updated his industrial strategy, with a few million pounds invested here and there. The likes of the automotive and aerospace industries have been rightly held up as examples of manufacturing excellence and have received targeted state investment. However, a welcome revival in industrial talk has yet to yield results. The chancellor told us last month that his 2014 budget was for &quot;makers, doers and savers&quot; and measures to boost exports were welcomed by business lobby groups. But that was in the context of low expectations amid a still sky-high deficit and with around half of austerity yet to come. Meaningful progress on exports has remained elusive, despite the sharp depreciation of sterling since 2008. With a need for more dramatic action, part of the problem might be attitude. While Britain dreams of emulating the manufacturing behemoth that is Germany, it needs to be more realistic \u2013 and that requires an approach that borrows from China. Maybe it is time the UK started from scratch and viewed itself as an emerging manufacturing economy, rather than losing step as it desperately tries to keep up with fellow developed countries such as Germany. There are lessons to be learned from China and other east Asian economies such as Singapore and South Korea. This was a theme well argued in a Trades Union Congress report last week entitled The Way of the Dragon. China, the TUC points out, is working its way through its 12th five-year economic plan, with the government actively trying to diversify its industry away from heavy manufacturing into more specialist industries like biotechnology. Not only has the state come up with a very specific, detailed plan \u2013 it is also seeing it through. There are caveats here of course \u2013 the UK economy&apos;s vastly more mature and open nature being a major one \u2013 but politicians could still learn a lot from the east. As Paul Nowak, the TUC&apos;s assistant general secretary, argues: &quot;Identifying key industries where government support could help emerging firms become world leaders, and encouraging UK companies to look for business opportunities within China&apos;s very detailed current five-year plan, would be a start.&quot; It should go without saying that there are areas of China&apos;s economy too numerous to mention here that Britain has no desire to emulate: poor treatment of some of its workers; food safety scandals; the threat of a credit crunch; and economic data that many analysts deem untrustworthy all spring to mind. But its active industrial policy is not to be ignored. Difficult day for Barclays What do you call a meeting of the Barclays bank remuneration committee? An awards ceremony. So quipped Lord Oakeshott, former Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, on the day of Barclays&apos; 2012 annual shareholders&apos; meeting, when feelings about bankers&apos; pay were running high. At that meeting, the head of the bank&apos;s remuneration committee, Alison Carnwath, pledged to &quot;continue to seek to push down remuneration levels&quot; and said decisions on senior pay had been &quot;particularly difficult&quot;, but correct. There was a 20% vote against Carnwath and a couple of months later she was gone, replaced by Sir John Sunderland. There is likely to be a rerun of this on 24 April at Barclays&apos; annual general meeting at the Royal Festival Hall in London \u2013 except this time Barclays has announced that Sunderland, who has spectacularly failed to &quot;push down remuneration levels&quot;, is being replaced before what will be a bad-tempered meeting. Next in line for the poisoned chalice is boardroom veteran Crawford Gillies, who will join in May. Investor ire will focus on the fact that Barclays&apos;s bonus pool was up 10% even though profits fell 32% \u2013 and that bonuses were again higher than dividends (for shareholders who had to shell out \u00a35.8bn on a rights issue last year to meet regulatory demands). Chief executive Antony Jenkins insists he had to pay up or face a &quot;death spiral&quot; as his bankers jumped ship to rivals. Investors might ask who exactly wields the power inside this bank. The vote on the pay report will probably attract vocal dissent, but Barclays can ignore it, as it is only an advisory vote. This year, however, there is a new vote on pay policy for directors, which is binding. Investors can throw it out and tell the bank to come back with a better idea. Then there is a resolution that will allow Barclays to pay bonuses equal to two times basic pay \u2013 in line with new EU rules \u2013 and another to re-elect Sunderland as a director. Barclays can, rightly, expect a very difficult day. Vince needs Italian equality lesson Last week saw a persuasive example of the difference between strong talk about discrimination, and action. In the UK, Vince Cable has threatened to legislate over the gender imbalance in boardrooms, but the prime minister of Italy has actually done something about it. Matteo Renzi, Italy&apos;s youngest-ever leader, underlined the gap between him and his predecessors by promoting three women to chair state-owned companies, including oil group Eni. In the UK, meanwhile, of the 289 posts of chairman, chief executive or finance director in the FTSE 100, just a dozen are occupied by women. While Cable needs a law change to alter the structure of private boardrooms, he should push for Renzi-like affirmative action in institutions controlled by the government, from Royal Bank of Scotland to Network Rail. If the government will not legislate, it should lead by example."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/apr/21/singapore-address-treatment-migrant-workers", "sentences": ["Faced with low wages and poor working conditions, Singapore&apos;s migrant workers are beginning to get restless.", "Although Singapore&apos;s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong dismissed the riot as an &quot;isolated incident arising from unlawful actions of an unruly mob&quot;, others saw it as an expression of long-simmering discontent.", "According to Jolovan Wham of Home, an organisation that supports migrant workers in Singapore, &quot;it has been observable, particularly over the past couple of years, that riots tend to occur among marginalised groups.", "This is a characteristic for many large-scale riots around the world.&quot; &quot;Regardless of the causes of the riot&quot;, Wham adds, &quot;it is a good opportunity for us to reflect and re-think our attitudes, policies, and laws which affect migrant workers.&quot;\u00a0 Singapore offers no minimum wage for its migrant population, and little in the way of legislative protection.", "Union representation is extremely limited, and organised public demonstrations \u2013 unless you are a Singaporean citizen \u2013 are banned.", "They didn&apos;t want to complain, afraid that if they did, they&apos;d lose everything.&quot; Migrant workers often arrive in Singapore with serious debts, from training and recruitment fees incurred in their own countries.", "John Gee, a prominent human rights activist in Singapore, says: &quot;Most migrants welcome overtime work, and it is very normal for men in the construction sector to work a lot of overtime.", "The legal maximum is an extra four hours a day, but we see many signs of this being exceeded.&quot; He adds: &quot;One accident on a building site in January was reported in the early hours of the morning: what were men doing working so late into the night?&quot; Such questions require urgent attention, and cannot go unanswered in a country of Singapore&apos;s wealth.", "According to WealthInsight, nearly one in 20 Singaporeans will be millionaires by 2017.", "As Gee says: &quot;When assessing educational standards or economic performance, Singapore compares itself to the best countries in the world."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-21T13:00:00Z", "title": "Singapore needs to address its treatment of migrant workers", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Policy and advocacy", "Singapore", "Migration and development", "Global economy", "Employment", "Human rights", "Economics", "Employment law"], "article": "Faced with low wages and poor working conditions, Singapore&apos;s migrant workers are beginning to get restless. Last year, a fierce riot broke out in the suburb of Little India, after an Indian worker died in a road accident. The riot was as violent as it was rare (the last riot took place in 1969) and provoked intense scrutiny into how migrant workers are treated in the country. Although Singapore&apos;s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong dismissed the riot as an &quot;isolated incident arising from unlawful actions of an unruly mob&quot;, others saw it as an expression of long-simmering discontent. An editorial in The New York Times argued that migrant workers were &quot;underappreciated and underpaid&quot;, and attributed the riot to systematic problems with migrant living conditions. The riot was not caused solely by migrant working conditions. Other factors included alcohol and anger at the way the police responded in the early stages. According to Jolovan Wham of Home, an organisation that supports migrant workers in Singapore, &quot;it has been observable, particularly over the past couple of years, that riots tend to occur among marginalised groups. This is a characteristic for many large-scale riots around the world.&quot; &quot;Regardless of the causes of the riot&quot;, Wham adds, &quot;it is a good opportunity for us to reflect and re-think our attitudes, policies, and laws which affect migrant workers.&quot;\u00a0 Singapore offers no minimum wage for its migrant population, and little in the way of legislative protection. Union representation is extremely limited, and organised public demonstrations \u2013 unless you are a Singaporean citizen \u2013 are banned. And if you get injured on the job, chances are you&apos;ll need to fight for compensation, battling recalcitrant employers who delay payouts beyond reasonable waiting times or resist altogether \u2013 by denying that accidents took place on site, by taking you to a &quot;company&quot; doctor who downgrades the seriousness of injuries, or by forcibly repatriating you. According to Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), most cases take between three and six months to be resolved, while other cases have been stalled for over a year. Some workers have been waiting more than two years for compensation \u2013 and are still waiting. Moreover, workers receive no economic support from the government while their cases are being assessed, and although they are entitled to medical leave, their employers don&apos;t always pay up. Debbie Fordyce, an executive committee member of TWC2, says most cases she sees are salary disputes, compensation claims and medical problems. The organisation registers between 180 to 200 new cases each month, and at any one time is helping to resolve around 500 cases. Fordyce points out, however, that there is no way of knowing the number of individuals who who suffer similar problems but do not complain. According to Wham, &quot;The employer&apos;s unilateral right to cancel their work permits is a disincentive to file complaints. As a result the number of complaints lodged is not really indicative of the volume of issues being faced out there by workers.&quot; Fordyce adds that this also makes workers vulnerable to long-term exploitation. &quot;Recently I met four men from a landscaping company who told me how pleased they were with their job, their boss, their living arrangements \u2026 only to later admit that they hadn&apos;t been paid for 15 months. They didn&apos;t want to complain, afraid that if they did, they&apos;d lose everything.&quot; Migrant workers often arrive in Singapore with serious debts, from training and recruitment fees incurred in their own countries. First-time Bangladeshi migrants accumulate an average debt of $7,256 (\u00a34,316) according to a 2012 report by TWC2. With a starting wage of $18 (\u00a311) a day, it takes nearly a year and a half just to recover their initial costs. These debts compel migrants to work long hours and to accept conditions that would otherwise be insupportable. John Gee, a prominent human rights activist in Singapore, says: &quot;Most migrants welcome overtime work, and it is very normal for men in the construction sector to work a lot of overtime. The legal maximum is an extra four hours a day, but we see many signs of this being exceeded.&quot; He adds: &quot;One accident on a building site in January was reported in the early hours of the morning: what were men doing working so late into the night?&quot; Such questions require urgent attention, and cannot go unanswered in a country of Singapore&apos;s wealth. The country has the world&apos;s highest proportion of millionaires per capita. According to WealthInsight, nearly one in 20 Singaporeans will be millionaires by 2017. But these first world indicators \u2013 although it is an open question whether a society of elite millionaires is a sign of progress \u2013 continue to exist alongside third world conditions.

Their enthusiasm about the newly formed Aam Adami party, helping (in Jack&apos;s words) &quot;to root out the corruption of politicians and public officials and clarify the country&apos;s purpose&quot;, is so strong that a significant number of them have resigned their well-paid jobs and gone to India to campaign for its victory. Only they are taking on the corruption in all political parties, including Modi&apos;s BJP. In the recent Delhi assembly elections the contribution of Aap supporters from UK, the US and Singapore was a game-changer. Jack&apos;s claim that &quot;an investigation by India&apos;s supreme court cleared Modi of deliberately permitting the violence&quot; on Gudjarat is a misinterpretation. The supreme court ordered an investigation by the special investigative team and also appointed an amicus curiae to independently assess the team&apos;s findings.

Idi Amin, too, came from a poor background, beginning as an assistant cook in the army. Violent extremism is unacceptable, regardless of the early life of those who espouse it. To Mr Jack it may appear that shopkeepers in north London who support the far-right candidate represent the ordinary people of India. The numerous people left destitute by Mr Modi&apos;s actions (or failures to act) in Gujarat \u2013 from slum-dwelling Muslims whose homes were destroyed in 2002, to those Hindu peasants whose land has been seized for the benefit of big business \u2013 may disagree.Savitri HensmanLondon \u2022 Returning from India last week, I thought it was clear that ordinary Indians feel a change is necessary after decades of Congress party rule. The social inequalities are stark; everyday corruption is rife and frustrations evident in hardworking people. Resentment towards the massive investment benefiting Delhi at the expense of poorer regions is openly expressed. Indians deserve better government and Modi offers a promise of a better future. Hopefully western governments will give him a fair hearing and establish a productive working relationship. The necessary changes will not be easy and will require time to embed.

The basic diamond design of bike frames may have barely changed in 120 years, but the development of cheap LED technology has seen the evolution of cycle lights leap forwards of late. Elsewhere, developers are looking to smoothly integrate GPS technology into bikes or completely rethink accepted safety standards like bells and helmets. 1. Revolights from Emeryville, California         Revolights illuminate as the wheels spin, creating bright arcs of light \u2013 video     Revolights are a system of white and red LEDs mounted on the bike&apos;s front and rear wheels which light up as the wheels spin. Sensors calculate how fast the wheels are spinning and turn the LEDs on and off to create arcs of light \u2013 white at the front and red at the back \u2013 which are visible from all angles. The inventor of the lights, Kent Frankovich, says he didn&apos;t set out to create the arcs. &quot;The original idea was actually to try to make a more efficient headlight by getting the light as close to the ground as possible,&quot; he says. &quot;It wasn&apos;t until I had made the first prototype out of my apartment that I realised the huge added side visibility the motion of the lights created, which if you ride a bike you know is a big deal. Based on that I quickly made a red version for the rear wheel, and Revolights was born.&quot; 2. See.sense intelligent bike light from Northern Ireland         The see.sense 'intelligent' bike light \u2013 video    The See.sense &quot;intelligent&quot; bike light uses sensor technology from smartphones to assess the rider&apos;s environment and responds by making them more visible when they need it most.  When the sensors detect that the cyclist is at a road junction or roundabout, or passing through a dark underpass, it tells the light to flash faster and brighter. Founder Philip McAleese started cycling to keep fit as he commuted to his electronic and software engineering job in Singapore \u2013 but after he was hospitalised in a bike crash he started looking for ways to make his journey safer. Since 2011, all new European cars and vans have to be fitted with daylight running lights \u2013 but bikes don&apos;t. So McAleese set about finding a way of making a cycle light that was powerful enough to be seen during the day \u2013 but that did not require a bulky battery pack to contain all that power. &quot;My epiphany came when I was cycling along looking at the smart phone on my handlebars,&quot; he says. &quot;I realised that the smart sensor technology it contained could be used to give a light situational awareness. In essence, the light could be bright when it needed to be and conserve energy at other times. When we realised that we had the potential for a game changing leap in cycle lighting, my wife and I took the risk of giving up our successful corporate careers to move to my home town, Newtownards in Northern Ireland, to pursue a dream.&quot; See.sense lights were funded through Kickstarter, with the first finished products set for delivery this week. 3. Mission Lumen from San Francisco         Mission Bicycle's Lumen model uses retro-reflective coating - video    The Lumen \u2013 handmade by Mission Bicycle of San Francisco \u2013 is the world\u2019s first commercially available bike with a &quot;retro-reflective&quot; coating \u2013 with the frame and rims painted with hundreds of thousands of microscopic transparent spheres.  The bike looks grey during the day \u2013 but when light hits the spheres at night it bounces straight back to the source, in a retro-reflective \u201ccat\u2019s eye\u201d effect. 4. Loud bicycle horn from Boston        There are a few bike horns on the market at the moment but, unlike some noisier rivals, the Loud Bicycle Horn is deliberately set at 112 decibels \u2013 mimicking a typical car horn. The two-tone sound closely matches the pitch of a car horn too. Inventor Jonathan Lansey, a research engineer, says drivers react to car horns immediately \u2013 without locating where the sound has come from first. &quot;There are some bike horns that are louder than car horns,&quot; he adds. &quot;But we found that the sound of a &apos;proper&apos; car horn is just right to get a driver&apos;s attention without damaging your ears. There has been a lot of research showing that car horns are one of the best sounds to deter accidents.&quot; The Loud horn is another successful Kickstarter project. The horn is in production and the company is currently taking orders for a second batch. 5. H\u00f6vding airbag from Sweden     H\u00f6vding's video sets out its criticisms on the safety of traditional bike helmets   The H\u00f6vding \u2013 stocked in UK shops for the first time this month, a couple of years after its launch \u2013 is an airbag collar which inflates in under a tenth of a second when it detects the abnormal movement associated with a crash.  The company cites crash tests by Swedish insurance company Folksam, which compared the H\u00f6vding to traditional cycle helmets and found it performed far better in reducing the chances of serious head injury or fatal injury. The airbag weighs in at 65g, compared with around 250g for a conventional helmet \u2013 but the \u00a3299 price-tag makes it an expensive option. Fashion-conscious riders can buy from a range of extra outer shells in different designs for \u00a349 each \u2013 and, of course, it doesn&apos;t mess up your hair. 6. Helios smart handlebars from California     Helios' 'smart' handlebars. The lights on the ends of the bars can be used as flashing indicators, or paired with a smartphone, can offer turn-by-turn GPS navigation    Helios handlebars feature a super-bright headlight at the front, and two lights on the ends of the bars which can be used as directional indicators. Once connected to a smartphone using Bluetooth, the bar-end lights flash to offer easy-to-see turn-by-turn GPS navigation too. The project hit double its Kickstarter funding target last year and the team are currently in Shenzhen, China, working on production.

Perhaps simpler options, like the Singapore reading clubs for teachers who want to engage with academic journals, are a better idea. The highly accessible guides that summarise analysis and reviews, like the Education Endowment Foundation&apos;s toolkit, are also a good way of approaching evidence-based teaching. I&apos;m sure these ideas will be accused of being overly simplistic, but they&apos;re a good way of making research accessible to teachers. We can ignore the evidence, but we should not be ignorant of it. Take academics out of the room: Evidence suggests that the best way to engage teachers is through their peers \u2013 peer-to-peer networks are an important way of doing this. Maybe this is one of the reasons why the Evidence Based Teachers Network is popular, because it&apos;s for teachers, by teachers. This may mean removing academics from the room when discussing how research can inform practice. This review, Understanding what enables high quality professional learning, by Pearson, is very interesting on what works for teaching teachers. Remember that important ideas aren&apos;t simply driven by Whitehall: On the thorny issue of using research to develop professional quality, we&apos;ve found it helpful for teachers to feel part of the wider profession. Anything that feels directed from Whitehall or Ofsted is the kiss of death. This report by Dr Jonathan Sharples looks at what can be learned from advances in a range of fields to mobilise knowledge more effectively for practice, including in teaching. And this report from the National Foundation for Educational Research argues we need to think about changing how evidence is used on a systems level. Emily Yeomans, grants manager at the Education Endowment Foundation Make sure you get governors on board: Although governors ask about strategic decisions in a school, they don&apos;t always know much about the context in which to judge the answers. But, if they have a sense of the evidence being used to inform decisions, they&apos;ll be in a better position to do this. For example, if a school changes how it uses teaching assistants it would be helpful if governors asked what the evidence for this was. It could be because the school thought a change might help, had looked at how it worked at a neighbouring school, or had carried out a systematic review of the evidence (or used one that the Education Endowment Foundation prepared earlier). Carry out your own in-school research: At the foundation, we run lots of large-scale randomised controlled trials. These are predominantly organised by researchers, but schools can run similar projects. With enough pupils and individual-level randomisation, you can get quite good sample sizes. If you don&apos;t have the expertise to run a trial in this way, there&apos;s a guide that talks you through using the approach on our website. Maggie Webster, senior lecturer at Edge Hill University and subject leader for religious education Make evidence-based teaching part of the whole school&apos;s ethos: There are many schools who have turned themselves into evidence-based schools, actively choosing to have research as part of their school ethos. One primary school in the north west created a fabulous curriculum based on research that they had read, and they&apos;d adapted it to meet the school&apos;s needs. It&apos;s essentially evidence-informed practice, which I think is a useful term. Don&apos;t be afraid to follow your hunches: All research is valuable providing you can see the benefits to you and your class. And a hunch can become a piece of research that&apos;s tested neurologically or otherwise. Hunches don&apos;t necessarily mean prejudice and neither does using what you learn from what happens in the classroom. Joe Kirby, English teacher, blogger and author Look to social media to develop ideas: Though small, the education blogosphere is a fast-moving and fast-growing route into getting research into practice. For example, the teacher led ResearchEd conferences and teacher driven touchpaper problems suggest there is a growing movement of teachers who are willing, able and increasingly ready to drive the education research agenda.

Founded just four years ago by Lei Jun, a digital entrepreneur known as the Chinese Steve Jobs for his showmanship and penchant for wearing jeans on stage, Xiaomi will begin exporting phones to countries including Brazil, Russia, India, Turkey and Mexico this year. In December, Xiaomi outsold even Samsung in China, according to research firm Kantar, and it is now planning to take the battle abroad as the cost of parts needed to build high-end smartphones continues to drop. The falling cost of mobile computing pushed down the share price of British chip designer ARM Holdings nearly 3% on Wednesday. Sales of top-end smartphones were lower than expected at Christmas, a factor that hit growth in royalty revenues for ARM. The company reported slower growth than in previous years, with pretax profits up 9% compared with a 44% leap a year ago. Hugo Barra, recently poached from Google to lead Xiaomi&apos;s international effort, will play a key role in the Chinese firm&apos;s latest move. In preparation, the group has already changed its web address to mi.com, paying $3.6m (\u00a32m) to acquire the rights to a brand that it hopes will travel more easily outside China. Xiaomi shipped almost 19m handsets last year and was valued at $10bn in an August funding round. It plans to sell 40m handsets in 2014, and Lei has set a goal of 100m by 2015. Expansion outside China has already begun. Xiaomi has started selling phones in Singapore and set its sights on five other Asian markets: Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand. Xiaomi&apos;s growth has come largely through word of mouth \u2013 the company sells high-end products, which use Google&apos;s Android operating system, at low-end prices. Costs are kept low because the company spends little on advertising and on distributing stock to physical stores, selling mostly via its website. &quot;You can certainly call this acceleration,&quot; its co-founder, Bin Lin, told Bloomberg. &quot;It&apos;s our mission and our belief that this model should be able to achieve some level of success outside of China.&quot; The business captured 7% of the Chinese smartphone market in the fourth quarter of last year, ranking just ahead of Apple, according to research firm Canalys. It has also put pressure on native manufacturers, which tend to dominate in China, forcing vendors ZTE and Huawei to offer more affordable high-end phones. &quot;It&apos;s definitely disrupting everyone,&quot; said Ryan Lai, a researcher at IDC. &quot;Now consumers expect phones with high-end specs at low prices.&quot; Xiaomi&apos;s business is not limited to smartphones. The expansion plans were announced at a product launch in Beijing on Wednesday, where the company updated its television set-top box and unveiled two new wireless routers. Lei, 44, made his first fortune in software, and his Hong Kong business KIS Holdings could soon join fellow Chinese digital company Alibaba on Wall Street. In January, an application was lodged to float KIS Holdings in the US. The company specialises in security software and makes the Clean Master app, one of the top non-gaming downloads from Google&apos;s store, which wipes junk files from Android phones."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/24/is-perth-really-a-sports-graveyard", "sentences": ["Singapore\u2019s Sports Hub, with its centrepiece 55,000 seat stadium, is set to open mid-year and is expected to attract high-profile events.", "The WA tourism minister, Liza Harvey, told Guardian Australia that Perth would take advantage of its geographical positioning  \u201cPerth is in close proximity to South East Asia and shares a similar time zone to many major Asian cities including Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul,\u201d she said."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-24T01:32:46Z", "title": "Is Perth really a sports graveyard?", "tags": ["Australia sport", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "I was in the middle of a long drive to Perth\u2019s outer suburbs when I was snapped out of my reverie by sudden excitement emanating from the radio. The broadcasters were gushing, their enthusiasm striking. World Series Darts is coming to Perth. Woo hoo, Australian darts champion Simon &quot;The Wizard&quot; Whitlock \u2013 that dude with the mullet and goatee \u2013 will be making the trek to the Wild West in August! I shouldn\u2019t be so flippant. It\u2019s great that Perth is starting to attract international sports events. And smaller sports are probably a way for Perth to gain much-needed credibility as a destination for major spectacles. In July, two ice hockey matches between Canada and USA will be staged in Perth. True, the teams will be lacking most of their NHL firepower but there\u2019s already been sufficient public interest, the first scheduled game a sell-out.  Left-field initiatives are emerging, including a proposal to redevelop Perth\u2019s dilapidated baseball stadium \u2013 called, funnily enough, Baseball Park \u00ad\u2013 situated on the fringes of the metropolitan area. It has fuelled hopes international games could be held there in the future. The World Baseball Classic \u2013 basically the sport\u2019s world cup \u2013 is scheduled for 2017 and Australian Baseball League (ABL) officials plan to bid for matches to be held at a revamped Baseball Park. It seems like a pipedream but the WA government has put forward $1.5m for phase one of the master plan to redevelop the venue, with costs rising to $20m over eight years.  Other events in Perth\u2019s not-so-congested sports calendar include the Margaret River Pro, held in WA\u2019s south-west and featuring some of the world\u2019s best surfers, the V8 Supercar event and Australia\u2019s richest annual golf tournament, the Perth International.  Of course, there\u2019s also the summer mainstay, the Hopman Cup, which has been Perth\u2019s crown jewel because of its ability to attract tennis royalty. Unfortunately, the event\u2019s shine is fading with attendances dropping 20% during the last tournament in January. The Brisbane International has started to lure the big names \u2013 Roger Federer and Serena Williams headlined this year. Fears linger in the west on the tournament\u2019s viability and whether it will eventually find a new home on the east coast.  And that\u2019s Perth\u2019s constant bane. It has to battle with the east. Melbourne and Sydney are internationally renowned cities. The former is one of the premier sports destinations in the world, while the latter still radiates from its Olympics success 14 years ago.  Perth sports fans would not be startled if it lost another high-profile event. But some of Perth\u2019s woes have been self-inflicted. After all, in recent years the WA government did not rebid for the Red Bull Air Race and Rally Australia. It also balked at the chance to host Liverpool and Manchester United last year. Even worse, next summer Perth will not stage a Test match, although it was Cricket Australia who pulled the trigger on that decision.  Western Australians are notoriously one-eyed. It\u2019s a place where secession talk ludicrously becomes fodder for shock jocks on talkback. Yep, isolation can make some folk stir crazy. But even the most ardent Sandgroper isn\u2019t delusional when it comes to the state\u2019s sports infrastructure. Patersons Stadium \u2013 nee Subiaco Oval - is an aged facility. And I\u2019m being kind, I could unleash invective but there\u2019s no point because AFL matches will be moving to Perth Stadium in Burswood, apparently in 2018. The seats are uncomfortable, there\u2019s barely any leg room \u2013 it\u2019s worse than a budget airline. Fortunately, I\u2019m relatively young and emaciated, yet I still loathe sitting through hours of discomfort. I cringe seeing the pain the elderly and rotund people endure. Perth\u2019s other prominent sport venue is the Waca. A ground famous for producing pitches that made Dennis Lillee, a bevy of West Indian quicks and Mitch Johnson salivate. Regrettably, it\u2019s a horrible destination for spectators. Basic amenities \u2013 ahem, toilets \u2013 are inadequate and there\u2019s barely any shade provided for the bulk of the ground. That\u2019s unfortunate, considering the uncanny knack of interminable sweltering weather coinciding with Tests. During the Ashes last December, I remember wincing at the sight of English (and Aussie) fans walking around the city. Most supporters\u2019 faces were akin to WA\u2019s outback terrain of red dust. Sunburnt and dishevelled figures trudged around with second-degree burns. It was the catalyst for me having to turn down a ticket to Australia\u2019s final day triumph. Even the chance of watching Australia reclaim the urn wasn\u2019t going to propel me to bake under 40C heat.  Traditionalists may complain, but cricket needs to be moved to the Burswood locale. Despite the scepticism, the future for Perth sport lovers looks relatively promising. Perth Stadium is expected to have a capacity of about 60,000 (Patersons Stadium holds an underwhelming 43,000) and it is hoped it will finally become the international calibre stadium the city desperately craves. Perth Arena, which opened in 2012, has created a vibrant atmosphere during Perth Wildcats games. China v Australia basketball matches, exclusive to WA, were played there last year.  Perth does have one crucial geographical advantage over its eastern counterparts, and that&apos;s Asia. China is an obvious market to court, but south-east Asia is appealing too. Singapore\u2019s Sports Hub, with its centrepiece 55,000 seat stadium, is set to open mid-year and is expected to attract high-profile events. Kuala Lumpur is also emerging, which was highlighted when the city staged the Laureus World Sports Awards last month.  There should be enough scope for Perth to piggyback on these cities, and the state government seems to be heeding the message. The WA tourism minister, Liza Harvey, told Guardian Australia that Perth would take advantage of its geographical positioning  \u201cPerth is in close proximity to South East Asia and shares a similar time zone to many major Asian cities including Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul,\u201d she said. \u201cThis provides many benefits.\u201d Perth is smeared with a dubious perception nationwide. For the uninitiated, &apos;Dullsville&apos; is Perth&apos;s ignominious moniker. Despite boasting beautiful beaches, lush greenery dotting its sprawling landscape and pristine weather, Perth can&apos;t unshackle its staid stereotype. Maybe, just maybe, it can through the power of sports.

Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBC    The 2013 Proms were an extremely hard act to follow, with last year\u2019s first Proms Ring cycle conducted by Daniel Barenboim, and Marin Alsop making overdue history as the first woman in charge of the Last Night. But if outgoing Proms director Roger Wright also has fewer major composer anniversaries to mark in 2014 (last year he had Britten, Verdi and Wagner), he has got a epochal national moment to work with instead, in the shape of the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war, which falls in the middle of the 2014 season announced today. While the first world war did not generate so many major explicitly related compositions as the second was to do \u2014 Nielsen&apos;s 4th symphony is one exception \u2014 it certainly took a grim toll of composers, including George Butterworth, whose music will be marked in the 2014 season. But the long shadow cast by the first world war shaped music in the 1920s and is still artistically potent today, and Wright has daringly and admirably sewn a dark thread of reflection through the normally celebratory Prom summer, with a concert built around the music from the hit play War Horse, a world premiere, Requiem Fragments, by the late John Tavener on the actual centenary of Britain\u2019s declaration of war on 4 August, and war-influenced new works by Sally Beamish and Gabriel Prokofiev, as well as such established scores as Britten\u2019s War Requiem and Vaughan Williams\u2019s third symphony. The only complaint is that the war theme is so determinedly English. Could no German work - Max Reger&apos;s Requiem, for example - have been included somewhere?      Joey from War Horse celebrates the launch of the 2014 BBC Proms Photograph: \u00a9BBC / Robert Viglasky    As if to balance the patriotic sombreness of the war theme, there\u2019s also a life-enhancing emphasis on music\u2019s international dimensions this year too, with visiting orchestras from across the globe, including rarely heard visiting ensembles from China, Singapore, Korea, Lapland, Greece, Turkey and - their rise is irresistible even in western classical music - Qatar. There\u2019s also the more traditional visit of the heavyweight European and north American bands, from the Berliner Philharmoniker under Sir Simon Rattle, through the Cleveland, Leipzig, Zurich, Stuttgart orchestras, plus the high-class Budapest Festival Orchestra performing a Brahms cycle under Ivan Fischer. No Proms season would be complete without its more conventional musical anniversary themes, and Richard Strauss, 150 this year, is the season\u2019s principal honoree this year. There\u2019s a missed opportunity here, though, since the three Strauss operas in the season are the composer\u2019s best known \u2014 Salome, Elektra and Der Rosenkavalier. Surely the Proms could have given us one of the rarely performed Strauss operas, like the early Feuersnot or the late curiosity  Friedenstag - Day of Peace - written in 1938 and full of appropriately topical anti-war sentiments. British composers and conductors get a good showing this year, a Wright hallmark that will please many Prommers. William Walton, for no particular anniversary reason, is handsomely treated, with many of his most important orchestral works finding a place in the coming concerts. Tavener\u2019s death last year means that he is inevitably prominent too, as are Harrison Birtwistle and Peter Maxwell Davies, both 80 this year. No complaints about those spotlights, but it\u2019s a pity that Maxwell Davies\u2019s recently premiered 10th symphony isn\u2019t getting a Proms performance after its enthusiastic reception in February. New commissions, as so often, get a healthy showing.     Sir Neville Marriner photographed in December 2013 at his home in South Kensington.

In 12 months time we\u2019ll learn if Wright\u2019s not-yet named successor has made appropriate amends.

Singer-songwriters Paloma Faith and Rufus Wainwright are also to make their Proms debuts as part of this year&apos;s two-month season of 92 concerts. The BBC Proms director, Roger Wright, said the vision for 2014 remained the same, &quot;bringing the best possible classical music to the largest possible audience&quot;. He added: &quot;The size and scale of the Proms remains extraordinary. That is the reason that people refer to it as the world&apos;s largest and most significant music festival.&quot; The Pet Shop Boys homage to Turing \u2013 whole played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code during the second world war\u2013 comes 60 years after he killed himself. Turing took his own life after he was prosecuted for his homosexuality. He was finally received a posthumous pardon for on Christmas Eve last year. While Tennant and Lowe have performed snippets from the new work before, it will be heard in full for the first time on 23 July. The Prom will also feature new orchestral arrangements of five Pet Shop Boys&apos; songs by the film composer Angelo Badalamenti. Wright said: &quot;It is something about the power of the Proms that significant musical figures such as Pet Shop Boys, Rufus Wainwright and Paloma Faith are all so excited about being able to appear. As are Berlin Philharmoniker, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Budapest Festival Orchestra.&quot; There are numerous firsts in this year&apos;s festival, but one of the noisiest could well be the first CBeebies Prom.

There will also be the first BBC Sport Prom, expect the theme to the Horse of the Year Show and, possibly, Match of the Day; and the first collaboration with the National Theatre in the shape of a War Horse Prom, featuring puppets from the play and music performed by the Military Wives Choir under the direction of choirmaster and broadcaster Gareth Malone. Birthdays and anniversaries that will be marked include the 80th birthdays of two of Britain&apos;s most important living composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle and Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. Wright said global classical music would be at the heart of the 2014 Proms with more international orchestras performing than ever before \u2013 including for the first time from China, Greece, Iceland, Lapland, Qatar, Singapore, South Korea and Turkey. Notable conductors include Marin Alsop, Sir Simon Rattle, Sir Andrew Davis, Daniel Barenboim, Bernard Haitink and, at 90, Sir Neville Marriner. The chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Sakari Oramo, will take charge of the Last Night for the first time. This year&apos;s Proms will be especially poignant for Wright as they are his last. He steps down from his dual role in charge of Radio 3 and the Proms on 18 July before taking over as chief executive of the Aldeburgh music festival in September. &quot;I shall be shedding a tear during Elgar&apos;s The Kingdom for a whole number of reasons,&quot; he said, although he admitted looking forward to enjoying the Proms as he used to \u2013 &quot;cook and then sit down and listen to Radio 3.&quot;            \u2022 The Proms are from 18 July to 13 September.

The 41-storey City landmark is likely to be put up for sale shortly and is expected to attract offers of more than \u00a3550m from Middle East sovereign wealth funds and other potential buyers. Deloitte, appointed to take control of the tower, said the Gherkin&apos;s co-owners \u2013 a Mayfair-based investment bank and a German property investor, IVG Immobilien \u2013 had run into problems related to currency issues, rather than any difficulties with the wider property market. Changing exchange rates had inflated the size of the original loan and the owners failed to make debt payments as they became due on several occasions. Phil Bowers, one of the Deloitte receivers, said: &quot;This is a building in trophy condition whose space is 99% leased. The multi-currency deal that financed the Gherkin has been affected by the substantial appreciation of the Swiss franc against the pound.&quot;     The Gherkin has  run into trouble at a time when dozens of new skyscrapers are planned. Photograph: Grant Smith/Alamy    The first 15 floors of the Norman Foster-designed skyscraper are occupied by the insurer Swiss Re, which originally owned the building. It sold out to IVG and its investment bank partner, Evans Randall, in 2007 for \u00a3630m. Deloitte said the tenants, who also include Sky News and the highest private club in London, would not be affected by the receivership. The Gherkin, which is also used as a wedding venue, has not yet been put on the market, but a sale process is likely to start in the coming months. Swiss Re spent about \u00a3238m building the Gherkin on the site at St Mary Axe of the Baltic Exchange shipping market, which was badly damaged by an IRA bomb attack in 1992. James Roberts, head of commercial property research at Knight Frank, said Deloitte would have no problem finding new buyers for the Gherkin. &quot;The commercial property sector follows the general economic cycle and at the moment the central London economy is doing well and the City is improving. The EC3 postcode around the Gherkin is always slightly warmer than others because they are close to the Lloyd&apos;s of London insurance market which still uses face to face trading,&quot; he said. It could be sold to a large global pension fund, or a US private equity house, but it was more likely that well-funded sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East or Asia would swoop, he added. In December an investment firm owned by the Singapore government bought a half share of the massive Broadgate development in London for \u00a31.7bn. Kuwait spent a similar amount buying an office complex next to Tower Bridge. In 2013 commercial property investment in the UK hit \u00a353bn \u2013 mostly deals in London and the south-east \u2013 which was the highest since the financial crisis of 2008. But there were also warnings last night about the likelihood of the Gherkin&apos;s financing problems not being the last. Glyn Mummery, a partner at FRP Advisory, which helps with financial restructuring, said the multi-currency financial arrangements in place at the Gherkin were not uncommon in big London property deals and there could be further casualties. &quot;We expect similar crunch times ahead for overseas investors who have misjudged their currency arrangements.&quot; The Gherkin, which has won multiple awards, has run into trouble at a time when dozens of new skyscrapers are planned. Boris Johnson, the mayor, has been accused of being too eager to allow developers to change the skyline. The rash of buildings with nicknames such as the Cheesegrater and Walkie Talkiehave attracted criticism, some of it from Prince Charles."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2014/apr/25/proms-2014-tom-service-picks-his-highlights", "sentences": ["There&apos;s also the first ever Sport Prom, a War Horse Prom, and a CBeebies Prom, and a series of orchestral debuts of ensembles from Iceland to Qatar, from Singapore to China."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-25T06:00:30Z", "title": "Proms 2014: Tom Service's highlights", "tags": ["Classical music", "Proms 2014", "Music", "Culture", "Proms"], "article": "Here\u2019s my pick of a mighty more-than-handful of concerts from the year&apos;s Proms season of concerts. First up, the blockbusters. Strauss\u2019s radical operas In the 150th anniversary of his birth, the stand-out Strauss celebrations are performances of his most radical operas, Salome and Elektra, on consecutive nights (30 &amp; 31 August). Donald Runnicles brings the Deutsche Oper with Nina Stemme (who gave arguably the single most impressive performance of last year\u2019s Proms as Br\u00fcnnhilde in Daniel Barenboim\u2019s Ring Cycle) singing Salome; the next night, Semyon Bychkov leads an equally outstanding cast in Elektra, featuring Christine Goerke, Johan Reuter, and Felicity Palmer\u2019s Klytemnestra. Oh, and there&apos;s Glyndebourne&apos;s Rosenkavalier in the first week, conducted by Robin Ticciati, and much more orchestral and vocal Strauss throughout the season. The Berlin Phil\u2019s Bach Simon Rattle and Peter Sellars bring their transformative vision of Bach\u2019s Matthew Passion to the Royal Albert Hall on 6 September. It\u2019s possibly the most significant production of Rattle\u2019s time with the Berliners, a performance that changed the lives of the musicians who were part of it in Berlin a few years ago, and touched everyone who saw it. Sellars makes the audience part of an ineluctably moving process of bearing witness to tragedy, in which we are all involved and implicated. In Berlin, this was subtle, powerful music-drama; in the Royal Albert Hall, it promises to be yet more affecting. And if the St Matthew wasn\u2019t enough, Roger Norrington (celebrating his 80th this year) leads a performance of the St John Passion on 26 July. Mahleriana It&apos;s rare that Mahler\u2019s symphonies don&apos;t feature in a Proms season, but there are some special ones to watch out for this year from some of the visiting orchestras. Valery Gergiev conducts what will be a doubtless controversial reading of the Sixth Symphony with the World Orchestra for Peace on 20 July, Daniel Harding conducts his Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra in the Resurrection on 29 August; Riccardo Chailly leads the Leipzig Gewandhaus in the Third on 11 September, and Bernard Haitink conducts the London Symphony Orchestra in the Fourth on the 16 August. All that, and also the 1st, 5th, and 9th from the BBC orchestras with Marin Alsop, Juanjo Menja and Donald Runnicles. Gardiner\u2019s Missa Solemnis \u2013 and others Other individual highlights for me are John Eliot Gardiner\u2019s performance of Missa Solemnis with the English Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir in their 50th anniversary year - a late-night prom on 26 August; earlier that same evening the Budapest Festival Orchestra and Ivan Fischer play Brahms\u2019s Third and Fourth Symphonies. There\u2019s Andris Nelsons and the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra on 21 August in Britten\u2019s War Requiem; and the First Night of the Proms is a bold and deserved choice: Elgar\u2019s underrated oratorio The Kingdom with the BBC Symphony Orchestra and their 70 year-old conductor laureate, Andrew Davis. The surprises\u2026 Pop music is far from a novelty at the proms, but this year there might still be a few surprises yet with appearances from Rufus Wainwright, Pet Shop Boys, Laura Mvula and Paloma Faith! There&apos;s also the first ever Sport Prom, a War Horse Prom, and a CBeebies Prom, and a series of orchestral debuts of ensembles from Iceland to Qatar, from Singapore to China.  But it\u2019s the genuine novelties I\u2019m looking forward to, the 32 premieres of one stripe or another, including music by Simon Holt (27 July), Gabriel Prokofiev (29 July), Helen Grime (9 August), and J\u00f6rg Widmann (two pieces played by the Cleveland Orchestra on 7 and 8 September). Most intriguing of all is Benedict Mason\u2019s Meld on 16 August, a piece whose mechanics are remaining as secret as possible beforehand, but which promises to confound &quot;what we think of as an orchestra, of a concert, and even of music itself&quot;, as the brochure has it. And the season is also studded with performances marking the 80th birthdays of our greatest composers, Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle.  That\u2019s just my possible navigation through this year\u2019s Proms labyrinth: your own journey starts here; whether it ends up with Mahler or Mvula - or both, is up to you.

New computer files taken from one of his last homes in Nicaragua reveal he wrote the demand in an application letter for a history teaching post at &quot;King&apos;s College school&quot; for the 2009/10 academic year. In the letter, Vahey wrote: &quot;A basic value that I hold is to constantly seek to be involved with students outside of the classroom setting. I would not consider any position that did not offer extensive opportunities for interaction with students in sports and extra curricular activities.&quot; Vahey did not go to work at a King&apos;s College school \u2013 there is more than one of that name in the UK \u2013 instead taking a job at the elite Southbank international school in central London between 2009 and 2013. Nor is it known if he sent off the application. But the letters, which were found by US TV network Univision and have been shared with the FBI and seen by the Guardian, do give an insight into Vahey&apos;s thinking. The American teacher killed himself last month after he was discovered with images of children on his computer. He had taught at eight international schools across seven countries. Police believe he may have abused up 60 children at the London school by drugging them on field trips. On Friday, one boy whom Vahey took on a field trip said he had become unexpectedly drowsy after eating a group meal and then the history and geography teacher took him back to his bedroom alone. He believes he was almost certainly abused while asleep. The FBI, which is investigating his crimes with Scotland Yard, said it was receiving a big international response from people who believe they may have evidence of abuse by &quot;one of the most prolific suspected sexual predators that we&apos;ve seen&quot;. The cache from Nicaragua, where Vahey taught after leaving Southbank, is understood to contain a huge number of files, including images of a group of naked adolescent boys in an unidentified outdoor location beside a canoeing station, a semi-naked teenage boy, and pictures of the teacher with his arms around groups of children. Univision says it received the laptop from a security guard in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, who claimed he found it in a bin. It contains dozens of folders of images that correspond to field trips Vahey took while working at Southbank between 2009 and 2013. A source familiar with the new material described it as disturbing, and investigators in America have told one worried parent the volume of evidence is now so extensive it could be three to six months before victims are notified. &quot;Additional potential evidence in the form of a hard drive has been turned over to the FBI via the US embassy in Nicaragua,&quot; an FBI spokeswoman said.&quot;The potential evidence is being brought back to the United States for forensic review. We are working in concert with Metropolitan police authorities in London.&quot; The new laptop evidence also sheds fresh light on Vahey&apos;s self-promotional skills, that some parents said he used to groom them to entrust him with their children. &quot;I am a master teacher who enjoys great popularity with students and parents because my classes make learning fun,&quot; he boasted in the letter to King&apos;s College school. He explained his &quot;love of student travel and extensive background in this area&quot;, including &quot;white water rafting, an overnight in a traditional Indian village, zip lines, bungee jumps, surfing, snorkelling, white water river tubing, repelling down cliffs and waterfalls, riding ATVs [quad bikes], galloping horses and climbing Inca pyramids&quot;. He claimed to have led student tours to Thailand, India, Jordan, Nepal, Bahrain, Syria, Greece, Egypt, Russia, England, Kenya, Hungary, Turkey, Iran, Singapore, Mexico, Panama, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. Vahey promoted his foreign excursions through his &quot;travel club&quot; which he set up at Southbank after having run similar operations at a previous eight international schools in seven countries. Some of the folders in the latest data cache were titled &quot;Travel club&quot; and &quot;Nica Travel Club&quot;. In another letter drafted after securing a contract at Southbank, he told a friend: &quot;Southbank is not as financially well off as the larger London international schools, but it is known for having a laid back atmosphere&quot;. The initial evidence that sparked the international investigation was contained on a USB stick taken from Vahey&apos;s home in Nicaragua last month and passed to his school employer. According to an FBI affidavit it contained images of unconscious boys aged around 12-14. The contents gave the FBI probable cause to suspect offences of child abuse images and illicit sexual activity. The affidavit said it constituted evidence of &quot;minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct&quot;. Parents and pupils in London are waiting to find out who will be identified. Scotland Yard has established that among 90 images of children, 50-60 were of Southbank pupils and some showed Vahey had molested his victims. Families of former pupils have attacked Southbank&apos;s handling of the crisis. &quot;Until we chased them, we received no communication from the school whatsoever, even though my son might be a victim,&quot; said a parent of a boy who went on field trips with Vahey and moved abroad only last year.&quot;They blamed the absence of contact on the size of the administrative task. It&apos;s infuriating and unacceptable.&quot; Sir Chris Woodhead, chair of governors at the school, said the delay was caused by the need to confirm addresses of parents abroad. &quot;We first learned about Vahey on Tuesday afternoon/evening,&quot; he said. &quot;A letter to UK parents went out at tea time on Thursday. This was followed by a statement on the school website for parents who have moved overseas on Friday. A letter to overseas parents is to be sent tomorrow [Monday].&quot; Parents at Southbank will meet the school&apos;s leaders, police and council child abuse experts on Monday evening in central London. In a letter to parents announcing the meeting, Graham Lacey, the school&apos;s executive principal, said: &quot;It is now imperative that we meet as a school community as soon as possible, with a representative from the police and the Westminster child protection agencies.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/27/best-fast-food-in-the-world-winners-of-the-chowzter-awards-2014", "sentences": ["Nominated by Mark Wiens founder of eatingthaifood.com  Best rice dish: Hainanese chicken rice at Tian Tian, Singapore     Tian Tian, Singapore    Chicken Rice is one of Singapore&apos;s most iconic dishes, and Tian Tian&apos;s Hainanese Chicken Rice at Maxwell Food Centre has won global acclaim \u2013 not only did it gain Anthony Bourdain&apos;s approval but subsequently defeated Gordon Ramsay in a hawker duel, and for good reason."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-27T19:30:00Z", "title": "Winners of the Chowzter tastiest fast feasts in the world awards 2014", "tags": ["Food and drink", "Fast food", "Food & drink", "Street food", "Travel", "Life and style"], "article": "The winners of the Chowtzer fast feasts awards 2014, which aim to find the tastiest fast foods around the world, were announced in London today.

Overall winner of the tastiest dish in the world: Ceviche at Chez Wong, Lima, Peru     Winner of Chowzter tastiest item in the world award: cebiche at Chez Wong, Lima, Peru    Ceviche is such a point of pride in Peru that it has its own national holiday \u2013 28 June. Javier Wong, the chef/owner of Chez Wong in Lima, is considered a master of ceviche (spelt cebiche in Peru). His restaurant, which is far from fancy, is in one room of his house, in the rough and tumble district of La Victoria. There&apos;s not even a sign on the door. If you don&apos;t have a reservation, you don&apos;t get in. No exceptions. There&apos;s no menu, substitutions or alterations. Wong works with Pacific sole only. He gets the best pick from the market and is a master with the knife. He breaks down the entire fish at a small table at the head of the dining room and dices it up for a ceviche. He mixes it in a bowl right at the table with just the right amount of salt and lime. On most days, he&apos;ll add octopus, though occasionally you will see squid. It&apos;s served immediately. After the ceviche, you can add a tiradito (a sashimi-like cousin to ceviche) and/or a saltado (stir fry), which Wong prepares in the kitchen in a wok with a high flame. It&apos;s unbelievably simple, yet no one has been able to do it better. Diners reserve months in advance for one of seven tables at Wong&apos;s, proof that with the right ingredients and techniques, a classic recipe from a simple place can be as powerful and tasty as food from the world&apos;s most expensive restaurants.\u2022 Calle Enrique Leon Garcia 114, +511 470 6217.

Upon hearing he planned to visit, the poor nuns went into a panic because they had almost nothing to prepare. They prayed, then brought together the little bits of what they had. The result? A heavenly thick sauce infused with chiles, pepper, peanuts, almonds, cinnamon, anise seed, tomato, onion, garlic and chocolate. Served over meat, the dish has become a culinary symbol of Mexico, and every family and restaurant in Puebla has its own version of the traditional recipe. But the one cooked up by La Casita Poblana strikes the perfect balance between spicy and sweet. Order it served over chicken breast or thigh. \u2022 16 de Septiembre 3912 72580.

Marketing departments are increasingly under pressure to deliver compelling customer experiences and are more reliant on effective and efficient technology. IT departments have traditionally provided large projects to support marketing activities. With the relentless speed of change required by ever-changing marketing campaigns, IT departments need to be flexible and fluid in supporting marketers. How do the two departments collaborate to achieve their goals or are the now merging? What do these changes mean for the role of marketers? Here on the Guardian Media Network a range of experts have recently been debating this issue. Corinne Sklar of Bluewolf has highlighted how the traditional role of the chief marketing officer (CMO) has evolved from simply building brand awareness to fostering greater customer engagement. Instead of the CMO, the role could be renamed chief customer officer, chief client officer, or chief experience office. Sherilyn Shackell of The Marketing Academy has explained how in the &apos;age of the customer&apos; new demands are placed on all parts of the business and it&apos;s the marketers who understand these demands better than anyone. With marketers growing in influence within businesses, they are perfectly positioned to move into the boardroom, once they&apos;ve broadened their knowledge. Lorna Walker of Regent&apos;s University London&apos;s Business School has also pointed out that as marketing jobs become increasingly technical and data-driven, both academic and practitioner-led courses are under pressure to remain relevant. Join our next live discussion from 1-3pm (BST) on Wednesday 7 May as we discuss the evolving role of marketers within business. Questions we&apos;ll cover include the following: \u2022 What factors are driving the changing role of marketers? \u2022 How is technology enabling marketers to drive customer engagement? \u2022 How can marketers keep up with constant technological change? \u2022 How are CIOs and CMOs working together? \u2022 What skills do modern marketers need to thrive today and tomorrow?

Wilson Raj Perumal, a self-confessed match-fixer who was part of a syndicate that has been placed at the heart of a sophisticated network responsible for fixing hundreds of matches around the world, claims in a new book that he assisted Honduras and Nigeria in reaching the World Cup through his activities. Perumal had already admitted to being part of a syndicate that fixed a string of international friendlies by bribing corrupt officials and compromised players, but this is the first time that he has claimed to have influenced World Cup qualifiers. Perumal was arrested in Helsinki in 2011 and sentenced to two years in prison. He agreed to co-operate with the authorities and implicated his fellow Singaporean Dan Tan, alleged to be at the heart of the fixing and gambling ring that placed bets on illicit Chinese markets. Last year Europol alleged that more than 380 professional matches in Europe and more than 300 matches played in Africa, Asia and central and South America were under suspicion as the scale of the activities of match-fixing gangs from eastern Europe and Asia became clear. Perumal&apos;s book, written in conjunction with the investigative journalists Alessandro Righi and Emanuele Piano, details the huge sums of money he won and lost \u2013 up to \u20ac3m in a single night \u2013 and the huge reach of the match-fixing syndicate. He claims that in 2009 he set up a company called Football4U as a front to influence football players and officials. He claims he used an associate called Bee Hoon to &quot;make things happen&quot; and ensure Honduras won a match to qualify for the World Cup in South Africa. Although he never placed a bet on the match, because Bee Hoon wagered $200,000 of his own money and brought the odds down, he says his influence helped ensure a win for Honduras, who remained unaware of his intervention. He then details a meeting with a football official in which he promises to help Nigeria qualify for the World Cup in return for free rein in organising three warm-up matches and a cut of the money Fifa provides for hosting a training camp during the tournament. First, he claims to influence three players on his payroll to help Nigeria to victory in one of their qualifiers. Then he claims to have promised the Mozambique FA a $100,000 bonus if they were able to hold Tunisia to a draw and so stop Tunisia leapfrogging Nigeria and seizing automatic qualification. Mozambique secured an unlikely 1-0 victory. &quot;My plan had worked and I was the unsung hero of Nigeria&apos;s qualification to the final rounds of the 2010 Fifa World Cup in South Africa,&quot; writes Perumal. &quot;Ferrying Nigeria and Honduras to the World Cup was a personal achievement. &apos;Fuck,&apos; I considered. &apos;I got two teams to qualify for the World Cup but I cannot tell anyone.&apos;&quot; He also claims to have attempted unsuccessfully to bribe referees at the World Cup itself. Perumal, who served a year of his sentence in Finland after promising to co-operate with the authorities, claims to have had a hand in or profited from fixed matches all over the globe, from Latin America to Serie A. They included two occasions on which he is alleged to have arranged for bogus African teams to play official friendlies and deliver the required result. Perumal, who spent time living in the shadow of Wembley Stadium in 2010, also claims to have come up with the idea of bribing stadium electricians in England to kill the floodlights during the second half of a game if the score was advantageous. Asian bookmakers paid out according to the score at the time the match was abandoned, as long as the second half had kicked off. Perumal claims the scheme was &quot;sold&quot; for $1m to a Malaysian timber merchant via a Malaysian betting syndicate, who then targeted matches in England. Perumal also alleges that during a trip to England in 1995 he tried unsuccessfully to bribe two Premier League goalkeepers. Perumal was rearrested last week in Finland on an international arrest warrant. The arrest is believed to relate to an earlier conviction in Singapore, rather than to match-fixing.

But a new consideration, climate change, is quickly moving up the ranks as a major factor for corporate decision-makers. Recently, as climate-related crises have hit cities across the globe, it&apos;s become increasingly clear that companies need to consider the financial impact of a paucity \u2013 or an excess \u2013 of water.  Operational, strategic and quality-of-life issues factor heavily in the decisions that giant enterprises make about where to locate their much sought after capital projects. As the devastating environmental conditions associated with climate change \u2013 including water shortages, severe storms, natural disasters, rising seas and hotter climates \u2013 become more pressing, it&apos;s clear that these, too, will become key considerations for companies hoping to press their competitive advantages.  As a result, these decisions will begin to dramatically affect both traditional and emerging business, transportation, manufacturing and travel hubs. And as with anything else involving corporations, real estate, jobs and money, there will definitely be winners and losers. Supply chain links In the wake of natural disasters, which appear to be getting increasingly severe, a &quot;new normal&quot; has emerged among corporate decision-makers. With some analysts citing the impact of the mutable climate, more companies are adding a climate-change dimension to their strategic supply-chain planning and site selection. Adaptive management of climate risks is playing a growing role in boardrooms and C-suites across the globe, particularly at multinationals.  A report from CDP, the global non-profit that measures vital environmental information, found that 72% of companies surveyed see physical risks from climate change disrupting their supply chain. For New Orleans-based energy company Entergy, 2005&apos;s Hurricane Katrina was a lesson in the potential supply disruptions that could be caused by increasingly extreme weather events. Since then, Entergy has begun incorporating climate risks into its business planning and operating activities; consequently, it has strengthened its power-distribution network, including the sites that are most vulnerable. Water, water nowhere Companies often underestimate the importance of water to their business, and few have a comprehensive global process to assess water risk. But this is quickly changing, notably in the west and southwest regions of the US, as drought sinks critical water supplies. Companies in the food and beverage, mining and oil and gas companies sectors especially base their site assessments on high-level projections of water scarcity.  In 2013, the Aqueduct Project, a hydrological mapping initiative at the World Resources Institute, ranked 36 countries based on their water risk. Sixteen, including the UAE, Barbados, Cyprus, Jamaica and Singapore, received a 5.0, the worst possible rating. But if drought is a consideration, so is flooding, and too much water can also affect site selection. After Thailand&apos;s extensive flooding in 2011, losses for badly damaged global parts suppliers alone totaled an estimated $15-20bn, and the flood hurt the bottom line of several multinationals, including Ford, Toyota, Dell, Cisco and Honda. HP, another company that was especially hard-hit, estimated that half of its 7% fourth-quarter 2011 revenue slide was due to the flooding. Not surprisingly, global companies are increasingly assessing the issue of monsoons and other water-related weather events when making decisions about where to locate or enlarge their facilities.  As for the US, it won&apos;t be long before severe water-supply problems in states like California and Arizona will begin to affect their popularity as site locations for plants. And look for other states as well as cities with plentiful supplies, such as those surrounding the Great Lakes, to woo businesses with water as their big asset. Already, Milwaukee is leveraging the business potential of its plentiful water supply. It&apos;s certainly not alone.  Site selection heats up Water isn&apos;t the only climate issue that is increasingly affecting site selection. Too much heat is also becoming a factor as it becomes clear that fiery temperatures and air pollution can have a major, devastating effect on workplaces and workforces. Air-conditioning alone can&apos;t make up for such conditions.  A team of climate-change researchers recently studied 170m hospital admissions and eight million deaths in Germany. After tracking them season by season, day by day, for 10 years, they found that the temperature-and-pollution spikes associated with extreme heat events tended to increase hospital admissions and deaths by 2% to 5% the first day. Adverse health effects and mortality mounted with each day of a heat wave.  Interestingly, the analysis found that extreme cold events typically had a negligible to nonexistent impact on hospitalization and deaths.Distributed across the population of a country such as Germany or the US, the analysis estimates that the cost of a hot day is between 10 cents and 68 cents per resident in terms of health care and lost productivity.  Winners and losers  So, when it comes to site selection and climate, which countries top the list? The Notre Dame Global Adaptation Index (ND-GAIN), where I work, has ranked the climate adaptation performance of 177 countries over the last 17 years, has found that, while the top-ranked countries are often prone to sea level rise, drought and flooding, they are nonetheless able to maintain the security of their water, food, and health systems. They are able to preserve their fundamental ecosystems, and their coastal, energy and transportation infrastructures remain sound, enabling greater social, economic and governmental stability. The ND-GAIN&apos;s highest-ranked country is Denmark, which has an index score of 83.4. Other European countries and Australia round out the top 10, while the US ranks 13th, with a score of 79.  North Korea is the lowest-ranked country, with an index of 34.3, and Afghanistan, Burundi, the Central African Republic and Eritrea fill out the bottom five on the list of countries that aren&apos;t likely to draw many foreign industrial and business operations any time soon.  The most surprising low-ranked countries are India, which is number 120, and China, which is number 98. But as two of the hottest spots for global business in the last decade, both demonstrate the impact that corporate investment can have on resiliency. India has moved up 10 points on the relative ranking since 1999, and China has moved between three and six spots during that period.  In real-estate parlance, the desirability of a property is based on location, location, location. And while climate change may still rank below such factors as workforce and incentives, more and more organizations are weighing climate conditions as they determine where they will locate new operations.  Consequently, cities, states and countries that lag on the climate-change index need to launch initiatives, such as public-private partnerships, to strengthen their attractiveness. The private sector, of course, can play an invaluable role in this effort.

It tells the story of sometimes enormous sacrifice and loss of life, and of fighting wars that were not always in Australia\u2019s direct interest. The need for dependence on a major power lies deep in Australia&apos;s psyche. It is in our DNA.  There was a grand bargain: we would help Britain fight Empire wars and in return, Britain would defend us should we ever need it. Later Robert Menzies and John Latham, attorney-general and minister for external affairs, would not ratify the Statute of Westminster passed in 1931 through the British parliament because they thought it would weaken Britain\u2019s obligation to defend Australia. They did not realise, even then, that Britain had been so weakened by the first world war that it no longer had the capacity to protect us. Of course, a new world war would soon erupt \u2013 and as a result, Britain\u2019s Navy no longer had the capacity to fight in two oceans, and was not able to fulfil its part of the grand bargain. With small numbers and inadequate resources, Australia clearly could not defend itself against the advancing Japanese. Our prime minister, John Curtin, appealed to the US for help. American interest then, following Pearl Harbour, was the ultimate defeat of Japan \u2013 which also assured Australia\u2019s freedom.  After the second world war, the cold war evolved. Communism was regarded as a worldwide movement. It was outward looking and dangerous. In 1948, Berlin was blockaded. In the same year, Soviet tanks drove into Czechoslovakia. In 1956, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary. There was a communist insurrection in Malaya, which delayed independence for 10 years. Later still, there was an attempted PKI coup in Indonesia, and there had been major wars in Korea and Vietnam. All of which, in the conventional wisdom of the day, represented a dangerous and aggressive Soviet or Chinese-inspired communism.  Strategic dependence on the US and the ANZUS treaty therefore made sense in those years, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan reaffirmed the need for close links with the US. But a decade later, the Soviet Union disappeared, and communism was no longer a global threat. After 1990, an opportunity for greater independence appeared, and the capacity to build a strategic capacity to be fully master of our own decisions was within reach. Unfortunately, this did not happen.  Since 1991, we have become more closely entwined and committed to US policy than ever before.An Australian, Major General Burr, is second in charge of 60,000 US troops in the western Pacific. We have a frigate periodically acting as one of the escorts to USS Washington stationed in Japan. We have US marines in Darwin. That military force is turning step by step into a hard hitting, aggressive one, capable of exercising power anywhere throughout the region. With the development of new weapons technologies, the purpose for which joint Australia-US defense facility Pine Gap is used has been subtly and dangerously altered. It is now integral to the targeting of a variety of weapons systems, including drone killings, even of Australians in Yemen.      An Australian soldier looks back as troops return to their barracks in Darwin, northern Australia. Photograph: Maya Vidon/AP    While our forces have become more closely enmeshed with US plans in the western Pacific, America has also changed. It is now one of the most powerful military country, no longer restrained by an equivalent Soviet Union. The American exceptionalism doctrine, coupled with neo-conservative policies, have created a different America. In 1997, the neo-con Project for the New American Century think tank published a statement of principles outlining that the US would only be secure if the whole world were a democracy. America\u2019s duty was therefore to achieve that \u2013 if possible by peaceful means, if not, by force of arms. And indeed, the most credible reason for the Iraq war was the naive and foolish belief that to destroy Saddam Hussein would lead to a benign democracy \u2013 a model which would spread through the Middle East. No account was taken of the blatant hostility between Kurds, Sunnis and Shiites.  We should note that Canada, also a US ally, did not follow America into the Vietnam war or into Iraq. They exercised a degree of independence of which we appear to be incapable.  The next chapter is starting to unfold. The US has embraced a policy of containment of China. Military relationships from Japan all the way south through the Philippines, Singapore and Australia are being strengthened.  Hugh White has said, and I agree with him, that a clash between China and Japan, who are not really talking to each other, is highly possible. While technically the US remains neutral over disputed islands in the East China Sea, they have de facto sided with Japan.  If the US is involved with a war with China as the result of Japanese provocation, Australia, on current policy settings, would inevitably be involved. Our national interest would require us to stay out of such a war, but the marines in Darwin and the current use of Pine Gap would make it impossible for us to stay neutral. We would not be believed, because we are hosting an aggressive military force which is integral to the firing of a variety of weapons systems.  In distant days, if Britain went to war, we also were at war. We have now tragically put ourselves in the same position with the US, in circumstances far more serious for our future.  That is the decision Australia faces today. Some commentators have argued that Australia has to choose between the US and China, which is nonsense. I want Australia to be strategically independent, to have the capacity to make our own decisions, to not to be bound by US decisions and not be allied with the US or with China.  I want Australia to be able to work closely with our neighbours, and with organisations like ASEAN. Such an Australia would be able to contribute much more to peace in our own region than an Australia caught in the mesh of US policies. This is especially so since America has still not learnt that political outcomes can rarely be achieved by military means.  \u2022 Malcolm Fraser was Australia\u2019s 22nd prime minister.

This year\u2019s top 50, decided by the votes of 936 industry bigwigs for UK magazine Restaurant, placed Attica in 32nd spot. Sydney\u2019s Quay, which was placed 48th last year, dropped out of the top 50. Five Australian restaurants have made the top 50 list since its inception in 2002 \u2013 Rockpool, Tetsuya\u2019s and Quay in Sydney and Melbourne\u2019s Attica and Flower Drum \u2013 but this year\u2019s rankings make Attica the sole culinary survivor from Australia. Australian chefs are faring well, however \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s own Ben Graham works at the Ledbury in London, which placed 10th. Singapore restaurant Waku Ghin, run by Sydney chef Tetsuya Wakuda, came in at number 50. Copenhagen\u2019s Noma, winner on three previous occasions, reclaimed top spot from El Celler de Can Roca from Spain. Heston Blumenthal\u2019s Fat Duck restaurant, which is relocating to Melbourne\u2019s Crown complex next year, dropped to 47th. So what makes Attica stand out from the field, in Australia at least? The venue\u2019s exterior certainly doesn\u2019t scream opulence, being a simple bare brick construction squeezed within a row of shops in the perfectly respectable suburb of Ripponlea. The magic comes from New Zealand-born chef Ben Shewry, who now lives in Torquay, Victoria. Multiple courses of delicious food are served to diners, who have to negotiate a lengthy waiting list and the kind of bill you generally reserve for special occasions. Here\u2019s a first-hand account of the experience from your correspondent\u2019s wife Lyndal (who dined there without me):  Attica is \u2018experience dining\u2019 but the experience is not about the venue or a celebrity chef \u2013 it is all about the food. The service is exquisite, the staff are helpful and knowledgeable with no hint of condescension ... but the food \u2026 oh, the food! Even the bread at the start of the meal is incredible. It comes with a delicious macadamia nut dip and the very best butter you\u2019ve ever had, and thankfully it\u2019s so good the staff don\u2019t judge you when you say yes to a third serving. The appetisers are ridiculous \u2013 I still do not understand how something so small can taste so big. The meal has an Antipodean undercurrent running through it without the naffness of the term &apos;modern Australian&apos;. One in every few dishes has a native ingredient that you\u2019ve never heard of but then want to be a part of your life forever. I honestly didn\u2019t know how each course would better the last but the flavours were so engaging and playful on each dish and the pacing is so well planned that each course is a delight, and you never feel rushed or full (see three servings of bread above). My favourite dish, Ten Flavours of St Joseph\u2019s Wort, rendered me into a hysterical state. I still dream about those mouthfuls. It is so seemingly simple \u2013 tomatoes and ten types of basil \u2013 yet with flavours so complex that the dish becomes a moment. For a vegetarian who often feels neglected when eating out in Australia, having a full eight courses where each dish is as beautifully constructed as anything my meat-eating friend was served, if not better, was a cherry on top of what will be known as the best meal of my life.

In putting together 239 years of wedding fashion, explains Edwina Ehrman, a V&amp;A curator, &quot;I wanted the exhibition to involve ordinary people, not just weddings we&apos;ve seen before.&quot; The exhibition begins in the late 18th century, when cream and white was the dominant colour scheme. &quot;The first thing people want to know is when white became the choice of colour for brides. White was a very elitist colour, you needed a large wardrobe to encompass a gown you would rarely wear and that was hard to clean. When you get to the 20th century white becomes more affordable and so colour becomes fashionable. More fashionable women often look to colour, particularly in the 1920s when they wore gold and lam\u00e9 fabrics. In the 1930s, the Duchess of Windsor&apos;s &apos;Wallis blue&apos; dress was incredibly influential.&quot; Veils, Ehrman says, became fashionable in evening wear in the 18th century, when Britain displayed an interest in antiquity, spurred on by the excavations of Pompeii and Herculaneum. They were adopted by brides in the 1820s to mirror French women, who began wearing them for Roman Catholic ceremonies.     Silk satin wedding dress designed by Norman Hartnell 1933.

Since 2008, Ehrman points out, designers who previously turned their noses up began to put out bridal collections in an attempt to tap into a guaranteed market post-financial crash. &quot;Social media allows couples to not only to plan their wedding with greater detail, such as mood boards on Pinterest, but to publicly document every single process, from the engagement to the honeymoon,&quot; says Alex Butler, of the National Wedding Show. &quot;But really, the royal wedding has a lot to answer for. It popularised a certain look.&quot; Ehrman is adamant that the exhibition, which doesn&apos;t feature any royal gowns, is not about Wills and Kate. &quot;I wanted to feature the video of the royal wedding because of the sounds and emotions it conveys. The cheering and the church bells evoke a certain Britishness. It that sense, it could be anyone.

What an impressive debut from 30-year-old Singaporean writer-director Anthony Chen, who graduated four years ago from Britain's National Film and Television School. In&nbsp;its gentleness, its shrewd psychological insight and unforced accumulation of detail, his film is something to be compared with the work of Taiwanese director Edward Yang. \nThe story is a domestic drama, with&nbsp;an addictive hint of soap, avowedly autobiographical and based&nbsp;on the director's own childhood experiences of being cared for (along with two siblings) by a maidservant from the Philippines: the title is a Mandarin phrase meaning \"mum and&nbsp;dad not at home\". Interestingly, the little boy at the movie's centre is an&nbsp;unspeakably obnoxious brat: imperious, manipulative, slightly obsessive-compulsive. Perhaps all film&nbsp;directors have a little of these qualities somewhere in their pasts. \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nNine-year-old Jiale (Koh Jia Ler) is the son of two stressed working parents in late-1990s Singapore when the economy was tanking and people feared for their jobs. Tian Wen Chen plays the father, Teck, a truly terrible salesman whose attempts to demonstrate his supposedly \"unbreakable\" glass lead to disaster. Yann Yann Yeo is Jiale's mum, Hwee Leng, short-tempered and distracted. Jiale's beloved grandpa, who had been notionally minding Jiale after school, has died, and now his parents have decided to hire a live-in maid for childcare and general domestic duties. This new development, along with the fact that Hwee is pregnant, makes Jiale even more insecure; Chen shows how the boy senses and absorbs his parents' own anxiety and feeds it back to them in the form of terrible behaviour. \nIt is in this fraught family nest that the new maid must make herself at home as best she can. This is Teresa, or&nbsp;Terry, tremendously played by Angeli Bayani. She receives in submissive silence the news that she is to be hardly more than a serf: the new mistress demands Terry's passport from her as soon as she walks in and fails to reprove her son in any meaningful way for the appalling way he talks to Terry. \nThis group rests on a cat's-cradle of&nbsp;secrets and lies and cover-ups. Every&nbsp;one of these four people is lying about money. Teck goes through the motions of leaving for work every day,&nbsp;desperate to conceal the truth about his actual employment situation and his stock-market gambles with the&nbsp;family savings. Hwee Leng is privately fascinated with a certain dodgy entrepreneur and his self-improvement seminars. Terry is secretly doing weekend work for cash as a hairdresser, and Jiale is neglecting his schoolwork while he develops a system for predicting the national lottery winning numbers \u2013 a system which the school principal finds worryingly plausible. Meanwhile, when Jiale gets into trouble, Terry instinctively covers up for him and enables his behaviour patterns, sensing that denouncing the boy to his mother can&nbsp;only result in being fired. \nYet the miracle that Chen conjures from this poisonously dysfunctional setup is that Jiale and Terry begin to bond, probably beginning with a shocking incident that follows an accident with the balcony washing line. It is partly a Stockholm-syndrome symptom but also a genuine friendship, something that replaces an actual mother-child relationship. Yet the relationship that it replaces is not that&nbsp;of Jiale and Hwee Leng, but Jiale and her own baby, left behind in the Philippines. Terry has been allowed to&nbsp;wear Hwee's old cast-off clothes and&nbsp;poignantly begins to dress and behave like Jiale's real mother. \nWhat gives this situation its force is that the division between rich and poor&nbsp;is not as clear as it appeared at the&nbsp;beginning. In the globalised labour market, Singapore's professional classes are well able to employ those from the Philippines and devolve to them the duties of caring for and perhaps even caring about their children. But Chen shows how there is arrogance and hubris here. When the economy contracts, their haughty attitude is brutally exposed. Could it be that Chen intends Jiale, that pampered prince, to be a satirical embodiment of Singapore itself: cosseted, spoilt and entitled? Certainly those of us who have heard apocryphal tales and scare stories about Singapore's tough law-enforcement and its corporal punishment will find a certain scene very difficult to watch. \nIlo Ilo is a story told with enormous sympathy and flair, and an almost novelistic skill in getting inside the&nbsp;principals' heads. Chen is a real film-maker to watch."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/01/ilo-ilo-director-anthony-chen-interview", "sentences": ["When Anthony Chen was a child in Singapore, his parents employed a Filipina nanny.", "Ilo Ilo, which won the Camera D&apos;Or award [for best debut feature] at last year&apos;s Cannes film festival, is a sensitive, observant study of a Singaporean family under pressure, and their new Filpina domestic help, who&apos;s under even more pressure.", "Mary Poppins it ain&apos;t.

Generally speaking, he says, the relationship between such maids and employers is &quot;quite brutal. You invite a stranger into your home and have them form a relationship with your children over a number of years. Then when you decide you don&apos;t need help any more, you send them home, and that sense of family is very brutally erased.&quot; Instead of erasing his own nanny, Chen made a film about her. And it isn&apos;t brutal at all. Ilo Ilo, which won the Camera D&apos;Or award [for best debut feature] at last year&apos;s Cannes film festival, is a sensitive, observant study of a Singaporean family under pressure, and their new Filpina domestic help, who&apos;s under even more pressure. It is set in 1997, around the time Chen was just saying goodbye to his nanny, who had been part of the family for eight years. The character in the film has the same name: Teresa, or &quot;Aunty Terry&quot;, as Chen called her, and Ilo Ilo is the province of the Philippines where she came from and returned to. In the film, Aunty Terry&apos;s treatment is somewhat harsher than in reality, Chen stresses. She sleeps on a roll-out bed in the same room as the vindictive little brat of a boy she&apos;s charged with looking after. And when she&apos;s not being stitched up by him, there are the domestic chores, the cold, imperious mother, the father pushed to the brink by the Asian economic crisis, and her guilt over her own son, growing up without a mother back in the Philippines. Mary Poppins it ain&apos;t. This type of domestic arrangement has been the accepted norm in Singapore and affluent parts of east Asia for decades now \u2013 to the extent that few film-makers have examined it. Probably half of all Singaporean families have a live-in domestic helper, Chen estimates, though most of them are now from Indonesia: &quot;Filipinos have become too expensive.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s not like the western bourgeois idea of having a servant to show you&apos;re of a certain class,&quot; he says. &quot;Eighty per cent of Singapore is middle class, but both parents have to work to bring in the bread, and they need someone to help with the children. So it&apos;s not so much a luxury, more a necessity. It&apos;s simple economic pragmatism.&quot; That cliched &quot;Asian work ethic&quot; cuts both ways, though. &quot;You could argue that a lot of the maids have forsaken their own children in the same way these working parents have, in pursuit of a better life. There&apos;s a lot of irony there.&quot; The traditional Chinese parenting style has been boosted by Amy Chua and her &quot;Tiger Mom&quot; philosophy, and notoriously rule-bound Singapore could be seen as the embodiment of those cliched &quot;Asian&quot; values: self-discipline, respect for authority, hard work, corporal punishment. Ilo Ilo doesn&apos;t indict or defend the situation, it simply observes. It is marvellously even-handed and empathetic towards all its characters, even the brattish son, which makes it feel like the work of a veteran auteur. Chinese families around the world have told Chen they recognise so much in it, he says. Like the family banquet scene, where beneath the respectful niceties, relatives subtly jostle to impart their status, keeping a lid on their problems and making a show of generosity so as not to lose face. &quot;My films always revolve around human relations and the delicate emotions between people,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m very wary of making a sort of activist film or a huge socio-political statement. The last thing I wanted was to make a film that&apos;s didactic \u2013 what&apos;s right, what&apos;s wrong \u2013 life is too complex for that.&quot; One of the things that helped Chen portray his country so clearly was the fact that he didn&apos;t live there when he wrote Ilo Ilo. He came to London to study at the National Film and Television School in 2007 (where Pawel Pawlikowski was one of his tutors) and has been here ever since. He had already made 10 short films in Singapore, some of which won awards at Cannes and other festivals, but he felt he had more to learn before making a feature. &quot;I&apos;d heard horror stories about American film schools,&quot; he says. Directing had been an ambition since he was 15. While other kids were watching Jackie Chan films and Hong Kong crime thrillers, Chen was drawn to the work of Taiwanese auteurs such as Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Ang Lee and especially Edward Yang, to whom he&apos;s often been compared (Yang&apos;s A Brighter Summer Day is his all-time favourite film). He also discovered the French New Wave and China&apos;s &quot;fifth generation&quot; film-makers like Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. &quot;I probably didn&apos;t understand what was going on in those films, but growing up in a concrete jungle, I took an interest in the beauty of the countryside,&quot; he says. He was also smitten by Zhang&apos;s regular leading lady, Gong Li, it seems. Predictably, Chen&apos;s film-making ambitions didn&apos;t go down a storm with his own &quot;tiger parents&quot;, he says, though his younger brothers are in banking and business, so he&apos;s off the hook. He&apos;s practically a national hero back hom now. Ilo Ilo was the first Singaporean film to win an award at Cannes, and it has accumulated dozens more across the world since, including the Sutherland Trophy at last year&apos;s London Film Festival (Edward Yang won the same award back in 1987). He&apos;s met the president and the prime minister, and the film has been a commercial hit domestically \u2013 usually the Cannes laurels are the box-office kiss of death in arthouse-resistant Singapore, he jokes. He still can&apos;t believe it all. &quot;Being selected for Cannes is every film-maker&apos;s dream, but to be really, really honest, I was quite worried as well, because it&apos;s a very humble piece of work. It&apos;s a delicate film. I made it for \u00a3300,000. A film like that could go unnoticed and undiscovered among all the heavyweight auteurs and big stars there.&quot; After a year promoting Ilo Ilo around the world, he&apos;s now &quot;itching to make another film&quot;, he says &quot;I feel so useless when I&apos;m not working.&quot; It could be an English-language film (he&apos;s talking to British producers), or he has some ideas set in Singapore. Before that, he has another project to complete, he says. His wife is studying for a PhD in London, and they hope to have a child soon, he says. Their conversations about childcare should be interesting. The success of Ilo Ilo also had one unexpected repercussion: Chen found his Aunty Terry. His family had lost contact with her when she moved back to the Philippines, when Chen was 12 years old. Finding her was all but impossible, he thought. &quot;How do you look for someone with no address? The Philippines is huge: 90 million people! The only thing I knew was that she came from Ilo Ilo province. I didn&apos;t even know her last name, she was just Aunty Terry.&quot; But the film caught the attention of the Filipino media, which launched a campaign to track down Aunty Terry. Two weeks later, a niece of hers living overseas heard about the hunt on the radio. It turned out Aunty Terry, AKA Teresita Sajonia, was living in a wooden hut in a small village, raising ducks and chickens. Chen and his brother went to see her and had an emotional reunion, he says. She had tried to write to the family but they&apos;d moved house. &quot;She kept such strong memories of us because she didn&apos;t have children. In fact, she had a blue pouch she wears everywhere she goes, and she told us that my mum gave it to her, like, 17 years ago. When she opened it, inside were photographs of me and my brothers. That really moved us to tears.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/01/mh370-report-real-time-tracking-planes", "sentences": ["Nearby aircraft were asked to contact it if they could and Kuala Lumpur air traffic control tried the airline and counterparts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Phnom Penh as it searched for the plane."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-01T18:23:00Z", "title": "MH370 report reveals 17-minute delay in querying missing plane", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "It took 17 minutes for air traffic controllers to realise that Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 had disappeared from their screens - and four hours to launch a rescue operation, according to documents issued on Thursday night by the Malaysian government. The report, which was released with the plane&apos;s cargo manifest, seating plan, and audio recordings of conversations between the pilots and air traffic controllers, also called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation to consider real-time tracking of passenger airplanes. The timing of the plane&apos;s disappearance was one of the details that first aroused suspicions that it might have been done deliberately: it happened at the boundary of air traffic control zones, two minutes after authorities in Kuala Lumpur told the pilots they should next contact Vietnamese officials. They never did so - prompting workers in Ho Chi Minh city to raise the alarm. Kuala Lumpur has been widely criticised for its handling of the plane&apos;s disappearance. Doug Maclean, air traffic control consultant at DKM Aviation, said the delay in querying the missing plane was &quot;extraordinary&quot;. He said: &quot;If an aeroplane went missing on a handover between two countries you would expect some kind of action within 3 to 5 minutes maximum. In Europe or America you would be on the phone within three minutes \u2013 17 minutes is quite an extraordinary length of time.&quot; &quot;We have procedures going over vast oceans where you might wait 30 or 40 minutes for a position report but in a radar environment you can see an aeroplane on the screen \u2013 so if you can&apos;t see it, why is it not there?&quot; MH370 disappeared shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am on 8 March, bound for Beijing, with 239 people on board. Investigators believe it was deliberately diverted but say they have not ruled out any possibility. Vietnamese air traffic control began asking about the whereabouts of the plane at 1.38am local time, after it disappeared from their radar screens and did not make verbal contact. Nearby aircraft were asked to contact it if they could and Kuala Lumpur air traffic control tried the airline and counterparts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Phnom Penh as it searched for the plane. Malaysian air traffic controllers did not activate the search and rescue operation until 5.30am, and do not appear to have contacted military authorities before activating the rescue \u2013 a four-hour period during which military radar showed a plane believed to be MH370 crossing Malaysia. At 2.03am the Malysian air traffic controllers told their Vietnamese counterparts that, according to Malaysian Airlines, the aircraft was in Cambodian airspace. Only at 3.30am did they clarify that the supposed position was a projection based on the earlier flight path, and not based on any current signal. Planes normally communicate with the ground via their transponders \u2013 which communicate with ground-based radars \u2013 and Acars systems. In the case of MH370, both of those systems appear to have been disabled around the time that the plane disappeared; the last Acars message was at 1.07am and the last transponder contact at 1.21am. But the Acars system continued to make contact with satellites, and data shows that the plane flew on for several hours, with the last &quot;handshake&quot; at 8.19am. Specialist analysis of those contacts led Malaysia Airlines to announce weeks ago that it believed the flight ended in the southern Indian Ocean with the loss of all lives. The preliminary report states: &quot;While commercial air transport aircraft spend considerable amounts of time operating over remote areas, there is currently no requirement for real-time tracking of these aircraft. There have now been two occasions during the last five years when large commercial air transport aircraft have gone missing and their last position was not accurately known. This uncertainty resulted in significant difficulty in locating the aircraft in a timely manner. &quot;Therefore, the Malaysian Air Accident Investigation Bureau makes the following safety recommendation to ICAO: it is recommended that the International Civil Aviation Organisation examine the safety benefits of introducing a standard for real time tracking of commercial air transport aircraft.&quot; No one at the ICAO headquarters in Canada was available for comment at time of writing. Some experts have suggested that flight data and cockpit voice recorders should stream information during flights. Others have asked whether it should be made impossible to disable transponders. Malaysia&apos;s acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said Malaysian military radar tracked an aircraft \u2013 now known to be MH370 \u2013 turning back across the Malay peninsula, but the operator categorised it as friendly so took no further action. The radar data was reviewed at 8.30am on 8 March and within hours the prime minister ordered search and rescue operations to begin in the Straits of Malacca, off the west coast, in addition to the South China Sea search that had already begun. But news of a possible turn-back was not revealed until the following day, and even then no detail was offered. The report was issued as the airline announced it will close the family support centres it has set up in hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Beijing within the week and urged relatives to await further news &quot;within the comfort of their own homes, with the support and care of their families and friends&quot;. Its CEO, Ahmed Jauhari Yahya, said the company was &quot;acutely conscious of, and deeply sympathetic to the continuing unimaginable anguish, distress and hardship suffered by those with loved ones on board the flight&quot;. It also said it would make advanced compensation payments to the relatives, which would not affect their rights to claim compensation at a later stage. Search teams picked up signals they believe came from the aircraft&apos;s black boxes last month, far off the west coast of Australia. But the flight data and cockpit voice recorders have yet to be found.

His rise has been largely due to his being bright, bland and Asian \u2013 an irresistible combination for a Tory government dominated by posh white boys. But even someone with his polished self-confidence must have been anxious before his first ministerial questions; his only previous exposure to culture had been the business class in-flight movies between London and Singapore and his most recent contribution to equalities had been to suggest there were no women clever enough to be on the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee. Surely the Labour knives would be looking for a quick kill? Harriet Harman, his opposite number, waited 40 minutes to make her move. &quot;I want to ask him about young people and music,&quot; she said. &quot;The Department for Education wants to cut a further 12% of music resources available to schools through the education services grant. Will he intervene with the education secretary and make the case for music in schools?&quot; What was she thinking of? Did she imagine Javid was going to break down and sob that he had no idea what this music thingy was that needed resourcing? Did she expect him to start talking about the importance of giving children the opportunities to explore a wide range of financial instruments? To be fair, Javid did appear momentarily nonplussed by the question \u2013 but only by its banality. He flashed a half-smile that might have said &quot;I love you, Hattie&quot; were he a man given to expressions of spontaneous emotion. But Javid is still a banker at heart \u2013 if that&apos;s not an oxymoron \u2013 and feelings are very much for losers. His most frequent putdown to other MPs is to say: &quot;I know the honourable member is very passionate about ...&quot; Passionate in Javid-speak means wrong. Having been able to tell Harman he had indeed talked to Michael Gove about this \u2013 Javid: &quot;Oi, Mike, can we chat about the music budget in schools?&quot; Gove: &quot;We just have.&quot; Javid: &quot;Great. Thanks&quot; \u2013 he felt emboldened to list some of his own cultural achievements since he had become minister. &quot;In the past couple of weeks, I have been to the Globe, which is supported by Deutsche Bank, and the Matisse exhibition at Tate Modern, which is supported and sponsored by Bank of America.

But it also reflected the language of the moment. Since the 1981 riots, political discourse had been dominated by the inner cities. Yet 30 years later, they are rarely on the political agenda \u2013 and not, clearly, because poverty and inequality have been successfully tackled. It was the Heath government that &quot;discovered&quot; inner cities when it commissioned the influential inner area studies, but the phrase really entered political rhetoric in 1976 when Labour&apos;s environment secretary, Peter Shore, promised to end the new towns programme and concentrate resources into the urban core. The development corporations that emerged after the Brixton and Toxteth riots, and the regeneration industry which followed, concentrated on luxury housing and office development \u2013 starting in reclaimed waterside settings, next to the once polluted rivers of a generation before. The idea was to drive up land values and lever in investment. The results fulfilled the best hopes and worst fears of both sides. On the one hand, inner urban property \u2013 especially in London \u2013 is now so valuable that it has fed the bubble that, according to last week&apos;s Shelter report, may quadruple UK house prices in 20 years. Last month, flats in the redeveloped Elephant &amp; Castle Heygate estate went on sale at a special exhibition, not here but in Singapore. Successive governments treated urban poverty as if it were a property problem. You might almost call it the British Disease. The term &quot;inner cities&quot; disappeared because, at least in the biggest cities, the inner areas are no longer pockets of deprivation: they are where the rich people live. Nobody mentioned inner cities after the 2011 riots, because most took place in outer boroughs such as Croydon, Enfield or Walthamstow. But the disappearance of the inner cities dialogue should not lull us into the sense that old-fashioned squalor has been defeated, when regeneration merely decants the poor to private rented accommodation in the outskirts, or outlying estates. There is plenty of inner-city deprivation still, outside London, but it no longer gets the &quot;inner city&quot; label. William Morris talked about solutions that have &quot;to be fought for again under another name&quot;.

TechInsights&apos; Teardown.com business, which takes apart and analyses new consumer gadgets, recently \u00a0examined the insides of Glass and put a cost estimate of $79.78 on its components. A Google spokesman called Teardown.com&apos;s cost estimate &quot;absolutely wrong.&quot; He declined to comment further. Possible points of contention may have to do with the physical constraints associated with a pair of eyeglasses. The Glass display, for example, is only a few millimetres wide, but boasts quite high resolution and could have been tricky and expensive to design and manufacture. But Teardown.com estimated that the display, touchscreen and glass cost Google only $3.  Even if that display costs as much as everything else, wouldn&apos;t that make the total parts cost $150?

Power  More than one-fifth (21%) of smartphone owners cite &quot;price&quot; as the main reason they chose their particular device, an increase from 13% in the 2011 U.S. Wireless Smartphone Satisfaction Study\u2014Volume 2.While smartphone owners continue to cite &quot;features&quot; as the primary reason for selecting their device (35%), the rate has declined significantly from the 2011 Vol. 2 study (57%).Reasons for purchase have an impact on customer satisfaction and future loyalty. Selecting a smartphone device based on price generates significantly lower levels of satisfaction (808 on a 1,000-point scale) and repurchase rates (18%) than selections based on product-specific reasons such as operating system (860 and 35%, respectively).  So people choose on price, and then regret it?   In 2014, the average purchase price for smartphone devices has increased and owners are less likely to receive a discount. On average, smartphone owners indicate that their device cost $202 in the 2014 Vol. 1 study, an increase from $174 in the 2011 Vol. 2 study. More than half (52%) of owners have received a discount on their smartphone in 2014, compared with 60% in the 2011 Vol. 2 study.\u00a0 When asked which features they would like on their next device, smartphone owners most often cite seamless voice control (36%); built-in sensors that can gauge temperature, lighting, noise and moods to customise settings to the environment (35%); and facial recognition and biometric security (28%).

Education ministers pray their nation&apos;s youngsters will climb the international league tables. Around half the countries that take part (66 in 2012) have made significant school reforms in the light of the results. When the latest scores in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa), as the testing regime is called, were published in December, England came 26th in maths, 23rd in reading and 21st in science. (The UK&apos;s overall performance was similar.) Michael Gove said the results &quot;eloquently&quot; made the case for a more academic curriculum, more rigorous exams, more academies and free schools, and other reforms introduced by the coalition. His junior minister, Liz Truss, went to Shanghai in China, which topped the league tables in all subjects \u2013 with Hong Kong and Singapore runners-up \u2013 to discover the secrets of its success. Chinese maths teachers have been invited to Britain to give &quot;masterclasses&quot; in teaching the subject. Now nearly 100 leading educational figures from around the world have issued an unprecedented challenge to Pisa \u2013 and what they call &quot;the negative consequences&quot; of its rankings \u2013 in a letter to its director, Andreas Schleicher. The signatories include top academics from Cambridge, Oxford, London, Bristol, Stanford (California), Columbia (New York), Ballarat (Australia), Canterbury (New Zealand) and Stockholm universities. The OECD, the letter says, has &quot;assumed the power to shape education policy around the world&quot;. Using &quot;tests widely known to be imperfect&quot;, it encourages governments to seek &quot;short-term fixes&quot; to climb the rankings; narrows our ideas of what education should be about; and kills the &quot;joy of learning&quot;, turning it into &quot;drudgery&quot;. Pisa, the signatories argue, dramatically increases the reliance on &quot;quantitative measures&quot; to rank and label pupils, teachers and heads. It is distorting the curriculum, reducing teachers&apos; autonomy and increasing stress levels in schools. The letter points out that the OECD \u2013 which has 34 member nations, most of them European \u2013 is focused on the economic role of schools. The 1,300-word letter to Schleicher \u2013 described by Gove as &quot;the father of more revolutions than any German since Karl Marx&quot; \u2013 is published on Tuesday on the Guardian website and on Global Policy, an online hub for leading academics and teachers. The letter argues that school reforms should not ignore the &quot;paramount&quot; role of socio-economic inequality in influencing pupil performance. It also argues that the OECD&apos;s growing influence over how schools are run and what they teach is profoundly undemocratic. Unlike Unicef and Unesco, it has no &quot;legitimate mandate&quot; in education. &quot;The OECD is a club,&quot; says Heinz-Dieter Meyer, professor of education policy at the State university of New York and one of the letter&apos;s organisers. &quot;There is not even an aspiration to democratic legitimation. You become a member only by being invited. The founders were the US and UK and they are still the chief influences. Just as governments in those countries were taken over by neoliberal Thatcherism and Reaganism, so was the OECD. Except that, while there is resistance to these policies in member countries, in the OECD they reign supreme. &quot;It looks more and more like a global super-ministry of education,&quot; says Meyer. &quot;It owns a very big chunk of the world&apos;s educational policy research. It has greater influence on the generation and analysis of educational data than any other single institution.&quot; Schleicher, he says, is endorsing controversial education policies. In the US, for example, he backed the Common Core, an initiative to establish consistent standards across the US which many teachers oppose. In New Zealand, educationalists say he has given \u2013 perhaps unwittingly \u2013 partisan support for the ruling National Party&apos;s education policies. The letter to Schleicher also says the OECD is cooperating &quot;with multi-national for-profit companies which stand to gain financially from any deficits \u2013 real or perceived \u2013 unearthed by Pisa&quot;. Pearson \u2013 owner of the Financial Times and Penguin Books and the world&apos;s biggest publisher of school textbooks \u2013 developed the assessment framework for the next Pisa tests, due in 2015. Schleicher told the Guardian that the OECD had hundreds of contracts with academics, researchers, public institutions and private companies to carry out particular aspects of its work. &quot;We do not enter continuing partnerships with companies; it would be inappropriate for us to do so.&quot; He also denied that Pisa endorsed government policies. &quot;All we said was that Common Core standards are in line with what they have in high-performing countries. We have empirical evidence for that.&quot; The letter says the OECD should cancel the next round of Pisa tests. This would allow time to develop &quot;more meaningful and less easily sensationalised ways of reporting assessment outcomes&quot;. Parents, teachers and pupils should be involved in discussing the changes. &quot;Education policy across the world is being driven by the single aim of pushing up national performance levels on Pisa,&quot; says one signatory, Stephen Ball, professor at London university&apos;s Institute of Education. &quot;It&apos;s having a tremendously distorting effect, right down to the level of classroom teaching.&quot; Another signatory, Sally Tomlinson, research fellow at Oxford university&apos;s education department, says that, though the Pisa league tables appear to be scientifically based, &quot;you really can&apos;t compare a country the size of Liechtenstein with one the size of China and nor can you compare education systems that developed over the years in different political, social and cultural contexts&quot;. The signatories are particularly concerned about the UK, the US and other countries imitating schools in Asian countries that come high in the Pisa rankings. They are suspicious of Shanghai&apos;s success. &quot;Shanghai&apos;s approach is an incredibly strategic one,&quot; says Ball. &quot;Their students practise the tests. It&apos;s difficult to see what their maths teachers can say to ours except &apos;teach to the test&apos;.&quot; In a recent paper for Teachers College Record, one of American&apos;s leading educational research journals, Meyer says Asian pupils&apos; scores are partly attributable to intensive cramming and do not translate into greater ability to come up with novel ideas and take risks. Though eastern traditions of filial piety and deep respect for learning can be admired, he writes, &quot;these features often come on the back of \u2026 unquestioned obedience to authority, limits on free speech, and acceptance of paternalistic government&quot;. The OECD, he warns, is expanding its testing into new areas, such as teacher training, higher education, workplace training and &quot;adult competencies&quot;. It &quot;seems hell-bent on assessing every square-inch of the educational globe&quot;. Public education, Meyer fears, will soon cease to be a civic and cultural project and become &quot;a training ground for economic fitness&quot;. Schleicher, however, says that Pisa, far from impoverishing education, enriches it because it encourages countries to look at ideas from around the world. Poland and Germany, he points out, modified streaming by ability in their secondary schools after Pisa analysis showed children from the lower socio-economic classes fell behind. &quot;Those were hardly short-term fixes,&quot; he says. &quot;Germany has become more unequal as a society but education is closing the gap.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 8 May 2014 to clarify Pearson&apos;s role in developing the 2015 Pisa tests."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/06/global-student-hub-launch", "sentences": ["Other than the UK, we know that you are reading Guardian Students regularly in the United States, Canada, Australia, France, India, Germany and Singapore, and many other countries."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-06T10:01:00Z", "title": "Globetrotters with a thirst for learning", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Education", "International students", "Globalisation"], "article": "How many languages are spoken by the students at your university?

A recent NUS survey found that 74% of international students thought that the introduction of a \u00a3150 NHS levy would make it either impossible or more difficult to study in the UK. Shweta Kothari, an Indian student doing a master&apos;s in journalism at the University of Sussex, says: &quot;Being an international student starts with thrill and hope, but can end in difficulties. Like many others, I&apos;m currently in the second phase of the journey, trying hard not to slip into the third.&quot; The politics around international students has had an impact on what it feels like to be an overseas student. The recent NUS report also found that more than half of international students don&apos;t feel welcome in the UK. The social side of life as an international student can be difficult. Missing home is hard at any time of the year, but cultural festivals like Christmas and new year can be particularly lonely times. Earlier this year a Vietnamese student blogger wrote about her experience of missing Tet, the Vietnamese new year. She said: &quot;No matter how much I tried to make my own holiday, I still couldn&apos;t feel Tet. The reason was simple: I wasn&apos;t with my family.&quot; How do international students get through the more difficult aspects of studying here, to enjoy the benefits of a UK education too? In this hub we&apos;ll look at some of the challenges international students face, and offer advice on how to combat them. As well as students coming to the UK to study, many UK students are venturing abroad for all or part of their education. In fact, recent research found that 37% of British students said they were considering studying overseas, up 17% on last year. In the face of \u00a39000 tuition fees in the UK, many of you might be considering studying elsewhere in Europe as a more affordable (and sunnier) alternative. You might even be looking at options further afield. The most recent study by the UK Council for International Student Affairs estimates that there are around 22,000 UK students studying in other countries. Or maybe you are taking advantage of opportunities to study abroad for part of your degree, either with Erasmus, on a sandwich year or as part of your course. 2013 statistics reported the highest ever number of Erasmus participants from the UK. &quot;Studying abroad or being in other cultures definitely helps students mature, not only intellectually but also socially,&quot; says Jane Ha, a student who currently lives in South Africa but has moved around the world while studying. &quot;Moving abroad makes you more open minded and accepting of other cultures.&quot; Despite the record numbers of students taking up Erasmus, the UK Higher Education International Unit this year introduced an outward mobility programme, which aims to meet the European Higher Education Area&apos;s target that 20% of UK students will have had some time abroad as part of their studies by 2020. The programme will try to encourage more and more students to get experience overseas \u2013 whether studying or on a work placement. Kothari says: &quot;I chose to study abroad to get an insight into the job market, acquire new skills and improve my employability.&quot; Whether you are an international student studying in the UK, or a UK student thinking of looking overseas for part or all of your university education, then we want to hear from you.

The resulting &quot;brand barometer&quot; is eye-opening: did anyone expect LA to beat New York or London? Or Tokyo and Venice to fall so flat?  The report measures two aspects of a city&apos;s brand: its \u201cassets\u201d \u2013 attractions, climate, infrastructure (particularly transport), safety and economic prosperity \u2013 and its \u201cbuzz\u201d, a combination of social media (Facebook likes and Twitter sentiment analysis) and media mentions. Assets and buzz were each graded out of 10; the numbers were added to produce a total score. (Scroll down for an interactive bar chart of the final ranking.) Although the research was not limited to English language results, the use of social media sites popular among western countries must be taken into account when digesting the list. In China, Renren and Weibo are used rather than Facebook and Twitter, which may go some way to explaining the poor showing of Shanghai, for example. Tokyo scores a buzz of just 2, again due partly to Japan using its own social media engines \u2013 yet Seoul does remarkably well on the same criteria.  \u201cThe western world is just not that in touch with the far east,\u201d says Ian Stephens of Saffron. \u201cTokyo remains, for most people, an alien place for an alien experience. [Its brand] is underperforming relative to its assets. Whereas Seoul&apos;s and Singapore&apos;s offerings are on a more global basis: visitors are very pleasantly surprised at what they find there, it&apos;s less &apos;foreign&apos; than they might have thought.  &quot;This brand list is all about how cities use their assets, how they do the best with what they have. Singapore, for example, is a transport hub and seems to be doing quite a lot with that basic thing.\u201d Mumbai and Mecca are two more examples of up-and-comers in the brand stakes, while European cities \u2013 with the exception of London and Paris \u2013 struggle. Venice isn&apos;t the only loser, just the most surprising. \u201cAll the European cities do relatively poorly, perhaps because there are so many crammed up against each other,\u201d says Stephens. On the whole, the results do show a clear correlation between asset strength and brand reputation. Cities hoping to buy themselves a bit of buzz should take this to heart. As Saffron founder Wally Olins, who died this month, liked to say: when it comes to brands, you can&apos;t just talk the talk, you have to walk the walk.

After days or weeks at sea, smelling of sweat and shit, the first glimpse some get of Australia is of the cramped bunk beds below deck on the Customs vessel.  The children draw pictures on the bunks. Pictures of the bunks show crayon etchings of houses and smiling faces, hopeful images that could have been drawn by children in schools anywhere in the country. But all the asylum seekers who now spend time on Australian Customs vessels are likely to be send straight back to Indonesia on a dinky orange lifeboat that has become a dark symbol of Australia\u2019s asylum policy. The military-led Operation Sovereign Borders has cast a long shadow over the seas between Indonesia and Australia. Immigration minister Scott Morrison and lieutenant general Angus Campbell have refused to discuss what they describe as the \u201con-water\u201d activities of vessels involved. But new pictures obtained by Guardian Australia and accounts from Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) staff reveal that the Ocean Protector was involved in the first use of the orange lifeboats, and that one of the incursions into Indonesian waters was directly related to their use. It was late on 14 January when the Ocean Protector began to move. It had been heading gradually north-east towards Indonesia from Christmas Island. It was needed for an operation that was getting under way. An ACBPS source explains how this happens: \u201cCustoms have their own couple of satellite phones, and they ring at all hours and usually it\u2019s never good news. That phone will ring and then whoever is on the bridge will go and get the commander on board \u2026 he will come up and talk on the phone and then say whatever they\u2019re doing or wherever they\u2019re going.\u201d This was no ordinary operation. The vessel was meeting the Triton, another Customs vessel, to deliver one of the orange lifeboats for the Triton to tow back to Indonesian waters. One of the Ocean Protector\u2019s roles in Operation Sovereign Borders is to deliver lifeboats where they are needed across the Indian Ocean. The vessel has been making repeated journeys to and from Singapore to pick up the boats, and is now based at Christmas Island, rather than Darwin. The Norwegian-built ship is one of the largest vessels involved in Operation Sovereign Borders, and was initially designed for offshore construction. The large deck is used to store the lifeboats, and a massive crane puts them in the water. These operations begin with an order from one of the command centres involved in Operation Sovereign Borders to deploy a lifeboat for the return of a group of asylum seekers. A vessel more suited to towing the boats \u2013 such as the Triton \u2013 would be deployed for the mission. The Ocean Protector would meet it at sea, where they would haul the lifeboats off the ship and into the water so the Triton could begin the tow. This is what happened with the first lifeboat used by the Ocean Protector. Fairfax media interviewed a group of asylum seekers who were picked up by a navy vessel and then transferred to the Triton before being bundled into the lifeboat. In March the ABC\u2019s 7.30 broadcast footage shot inside one of the lifeboats and graphic descriptions by asylum seekers of conditions on the boats. One Customs source explains how the turnback mission was originally planned to start at 1am, but began at 6am: \u201cThey wanted it done at 1am. I can\u2019t see any advantage to that, it just means someone was going to get hurt.\u201d The Ocean Protector had no direct contact with this group of asylum seekers \u2013 its only involvement was to drop off the lifeboat. But this had serious ramifications for Operation Sovereign Borders; both vessels were inside Indonesian waters in one of a number of incursions into their territory that were described by Scott Morrison as inadvertent. During the operation, the vessel went deep into Indonesian waters, nine kilometres past one of Indonesia\u2019s baselines and into Pelabuhan Ratu bay, according to digital maps obtained by Guardian Australia. It is unclear how the vessel could have inadvertently gone so far into Indonesian waters. The navigational charts from the Ocean Protector show that the vessel had calculated the correct boundaries of Indonesia\u2019s territorial waters, casting doubt on some of the findings of a review commissioned to investigate the incursions. A Customs spokesman said in April that no evidence was presented to the review that indicated the Ocean Protector knew the correct location of the Indonesian boundaries. This week a spokesman declined to say whether Customs stood by the findings of the review, or whether the navigational charts had caused Customs to revisit the findings. Once the Triton had the lifeboat, it was eventually untethered from the vessel and began the journey back to Indonesia. The lifeboats were stripped of other items before the asylum seekers were placed in them, a Customs source said, raising further concerns about the operations. And while use of the lifeboats and turnback operations continue, experts in maritime and international law have also expressed concerns about the legality of the policy. Azadeh Dastyari, a lecturer in refugee and human rights law at Monash university, said that by interfering with asylum seeker vessels \u2013 either on the high seas or in Indonesia\u2019s territorial waters \u2013 Australia was violating international law. \u201cOn the high seas \u2013 unless you have authority to interfere with another vessel \u2013 then you are prohibited from interfering with another vessel. That\u2019s where Australia\u2019s biggest issue is, we don\u2019t seem to have any authority to interfere with these asylum seeker vessels,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether we then bring people onto our vessels or put them onto our lifeboats, that\u2019s still interfering. We\u2019re exercising jurisdiction on them, and we\u2019re just not allowed to do that.\u201d She said Indonesia\u2019s failure to sign the United Nations refugee convention also led to a breach of international law. \u201cIndonesia hasn\u2019t signed on to the refugee convention. It\u2019s not enough for us to say that they\u2019re safe and not being returned to Sri Lanka, Iran or Afghanistan. Because Indonesia hasn\u2019t guaranteed people won\u2019t be returned from harm, then that obligation remains on us,\u201d she said. Donald Rothwell, a professor of international law at the Australian National University, said in a submission to the Senate inquiry into the breaches: \u201cAustralia has no legal basis to tow back asylum seeker vessels into the Indonesian territorial sea. \u201cAustralia\u2019s transfer of asylum seekers to lifeboats for the purposes of being towed back to Indonesia raises issues as to the legality of the transfer and significant issues of state responsibility in the event of an incident at sea involving that lifeboat.\u201d An ACBPS spokesman said: \u201cThe Australian government conducts its operations consistent with Australia\u2019s international obligations.\u201d And the silence surrounding Operation Sovereign Borders continues. The immigration minister did not respond to any questions about the use of the lifeboats, the Ocean Protector or the Triton."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/may/07/amazing-spider-man-2-bad-neighbours-uk-box-office", "sentences": ["Acclaimed Singapore-set Ilo Ilo stayed tight with a 10-venue rollout, but the strategy didn&apos;t translate into a stronger screen average, since the film debuted with just over \u00a310,000."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-07T06:23:00Z", "title": "Spider-Man 2 is still amazing but Bad Neighbours secretly stuns UK box office", "tags": ["The Amazing Spider-Man 2", "Bad Neighbours", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "The winner Dropping 41% from the previous weekend, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 holds on to the top spot for a third week in a row, with a cumulative gross of \u00a319.77m. Adding in takings from bank holiday Monday, the Spidey sequel is now comfortably through the \u00a320m barrier with \u00a320.5m. Despite the Bank Holiday weekend attracting a number of wide releases, notably big-budget 3D disaster movie Pompeii, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has so far faced no studio blockbuster coming in against it, and won&apos;t do so until Godzilla and X-Men: Days of Future Past arrive later this month.           The original Amazing Spider-Man stood at \u00a322.27m after three weekends of play, on its way to \u00a326m. That film started strong, but faced tough competition, and was already down to just \u00a31.05m takings on its third frame, as against \u00a31.98m just scored by The Amazing Spider-Man 2. For that reason, Sony will be hoping the current film can eventually out-perform its predecessor. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is only the third film this year to post three successive weekends at the top spot, following The Wolf of Wall Street and The Lego Movie. Wolf and Lego are the only titles to have outgrossed Spidey at the 2014 box office. The real winner           Not included in the official box-office rankings, but nevertheless the real chart champion, is raucous comedy Bad Neighbours and that&apos;s despite only playing two out of the three weekend days, ie Saturday and Sunday. The film continues to play every day this week, before its official opening on Friday. All nine days of takings \u2013 the six days of previews, plus the three days of the official weekend period \u2013 will be announced together next week as its opening number. Twitter has been abuzz with conspiracy theories that this strategy represents a scam to artificially inflate the opening number for Bad Neighbours, when it&apos;s officially announced, to be then trumpeted in marketing. However, it turns out Bad Neighbours didn&apos;t need any artificial boosting to claim the top spot. The film is reported to have grossed over \u00a32.5m on Saturday and Sunday (well ahead of official top title The Amazing Spider-Man 2), rising to \u00a33.5m including bank holiday Monday.            Considering that sunny skies for much of the weekend will have negatively impacted numbers across the board, it&apos;s a stunning result. Even if Bad Neighbours only manages to average \u00a3500,000 a day for the rest of the week, it will still be carrying forward a hefty \u00a35m in previews into the upcoming weekend play period. Universal&apos;s explanation of its strategy is simply that &quot;with Bad Neighbours we seized an opportunity to start previews over the UK bank holiday weekend in anticipation of the worldwide release this coming weekend&quot;. We might still ponder why the date couldn&apos;t come forward all the way to Friday 2 May, but it&apos;s presumably due to a global alignment of official release dates on this particular title. The new arrivals           On paper, the weekend&apos;s crop of new contenders \u2013 Pompeii, Tarzan, Brick Mansions and Plastic \u2013 collectively suggested a fair amount of commercial appeal. Pompeii boasts big-budget spectacle and Game of Thrones star Kit Harington. The animated Tarzan looked a reasonably sure bet for families. Brick Mansions, a remake of French parkour-inflected actioner District 13, features the last completed performance of Paul Walker. And Brit heist flick Plastic, while certainly a distribution challenge, had meaningful talent elements for teen audiences. All four films disappointed, to varying degrees. Top performer proved to be Pompeii, with \u00a3876,000 for the three-day weekend, and \u00a31.17m including previews. Tarzan landed one place lower in the chart (see below), with \u00a3528,000 for the weekend, and \u00a3808,000 including previews. Brick Mansions arrived in lowly 12th place, with just \u00a3137,000 from 253 cinemas. And Plastic, starring Will Poulter, Ed Speleers and Alfie Allen, managed a poor \u00a3101,000 from 243 cinemas over the weekend, rising to \u00a3154,000 including Wednesday/Thursday previews, pushing it up to 10th place. The art-house battle           A profusion of smaller releases targeted audiences looking for alternatives to mainstream fare, but the sheer number may have left cinemagoers pondering which to pick. Smart genre picture Blue Ruin went out on a generous 56 prints, grossing a so-so \u00a3108,000 including previews of \u00a37,800. Acclaimed Singapore-set Ilo Ilo stayed tight with a 10-venue rollout, but the strategy didn&apos;t translate into a stronger screen average, since the film debuted with just over \u00a310,000. A Thousand Good Times Good Night, starring Juliette Binoche and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau managed \u00a320,700 from 22 cinemas. When you add in holdover titles that continue to play \u2013 Calvary, Tracks, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Locke \u2013 that doesn&apos;t leave a lot of room for other pictures, such as new release In Bloom. The Georgian teen drama has won a bunch of film festival awards, and boasts a very strong 8.3/10 user rating at IMDb, but an opening gross of \u00a32,900 from six cinemas (plus previews of \u00a34,500) suggests the market is just too crowded. One art-house title that is demonstrating notable traction with cinemagoers is The Lunchbox, which posted another negligible drop from the previous weekend. With \u00a3386,000 so far, Ritesh Batra&apos;s film has now taken over six times its three-day opening, and clearly has a way to go. The live event Once again, stunning numbers have been delivered by the flourishing event-cinema sector. The latest production from NT Live \u2013 Sam Mendes directing Simon Russell Beale in King Lear \u2013 delivered a gross of \u00a3771,000 on Thursday, and with encore screenings that tally rises to \u00a3809,000. That would be enough to earn it fourth place in the UK weekend box-office chart, and that&apos;s basically from a single evening. The King Lear number compares unfavourably with the top end of NT Live&apos;s repertoire: War Horse delivered \u00a31.56m for its live debut, and has since gone on to push past \u00a32.7m. Fairer comparisons are the top-performing Shakespeare live events such as David Tennant in the RSC&apos;s Richard II (\u00a3890,000 on the night; \u00a31.44m to date), Tom Hiddleston in the Donmar&apos;s Coriolanus (\u00a3754,000 on the night; \u00a3952,000 to date) and Adrian Lester and Rory Kinnear in the National Theatre&apos;s Othello (\u00a3735,000 on the night; \u00a3936,000 to date). While the success of alternative programming such as NT Live is great news for cinemas, the numbers can only be the envy of art-house film distributors. King Lear took more money in the last few days than many niche movie releases will in their lifetime. The future Thanks to those sunny skies, the relatively unappealing set of new releases and especially the non-inclusion of the Bad Neighbours numbers in official calculations, overall the market is 32% down on the previous weekend and 27% down on the equivalent frame from 2013, when Iron Man 3 continued its rich reign at the summit and 21 and Over was the top new release. This coming weekend, Bad Neighbours is certain to rule the roost, but multiplex cinemas will not be anticipating a box-office bonanza from the rest of the fresh crop. David Ayer&apos;s Sabotage, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, arrives Wednesday. Frank, featuring Michael Fassbender in a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head, should flourish in niche play. The Wind Rises is the warmly regarded final film from anime legend Hayao Miyazaki. Before the Winter Chill is that latest French outing for Kristin Scott Thomas.

Riga            The heterosexual Latvian equivalent (there&apos;s a phrase you don&apos;t get to write very often) to the Stockholm campaign, the message here is simple: visit Riga, take photos, meet babes.

Ahead of the show, Jack Steadman, Jamie MacColl, Suren de Saram and Ed Nash released So Long, See You Tomorrow, their fourth album. Reaching No 1 in the UK album charts, the album was self-produced and influenced by the band&apos;s globe-trotting. &quot;Frontman Jack Steadman has been travelling, and returned with a satchel-full of Bollywood samples, which twine sinuously through Overdone and Feel, and an armoury of percussive instruments, neatly deployed in Luna and the title track,&quot; writes Maddy Costa.  Below you can read a short interview with drummer Suren de Saram, and watch a playlist assembled from the show \u2013 the fourth in our Live for 2014 series in partnership with Lovelive and Spotify. We&apos;ll be launching our fourth show next week. 1 What do you remember about your first ever gig? The band originally got together to play at a school assembly, so that was our first public performance but I don&apos;t know if you could really call it a gig. We did covers of Cissy Strut by The Meters, C-C (You Set The Fire In Me) by Tom Vek and then one of our own songs called Something Ain&apos;t Right. Our first proper gig was at an underage night that a couple of our friends put on at a local pub called Lark in the Park, which is not there any more sadly. We just invited all our friends along so the place was packed with 15-year-olds having a good time. I remember we got a bra thrown at us so we felt pretty rock&apos;n&apos;roll. We also did a cover of Candy Shop by 50 Cent! 2 What was your best ever show?  Probably when we played Alexandra Palace two years ago. Growing up, it was our local big venue. We used to rehearse at Jamie&apos;s house where we could see Ally Pally from his window and to finally get to headline a gig there was just mind blowing. It was an emotional night because it was obviously a real milestone for us and we had a ton of family and friends there to see us. Sometimes those occasions don&apos;t live up to your expectations but this one certainly did. It was one of very few gigs I can think of where nothing went wrong! Everything just seemed to come together perfectly that night. 3 Can you remember your worst ever live experience?   There were a couple of dodgy gigs in the early days. Probably the worst was when we played in the small room at the Scala when we were 17. We were on late (something like 1am) after a bunch of electro DJs, so it was a strange billing. We came on stage and obviously no one cared about us, they just wanted more electro. The fact that we were on late meant we had a while to drink beforehand as well, which we took full advantage of. When it came to our set we just weren&apos;t on the same wavelength at all \u2013 I think we were all playing at different tempos for most of the gig! One of us threw up immediately after coming off stage. 4 What pre-show rituals do you have? Now that everyone&apos;s doing more singing throughout the set, we&apos;ve made vocal warm-ups a big part of our pre-show ritual. Jack will get out an acoustic guitar and we&apos;ll go through these exercises together, starting on a low note and then going up chromatically. Recently we&apos;ve started singing a cover of Thirteen by Big Star all together as well. I&apos;ll be playing some rudiments on my leg while this is going on. Just before we go on we&apos;ve started high-fiving/hugging each other individually. It sounds a bit lame but it makes for a good feeling between us before getting on stage. 5 Who have you been most nervous about performing in front of? Actually on our recent UK tour Andy Gangadeen, who is a top session drummer who plays with Chase and Status and has worked with the Spice Girls among many other people in the past, was at a few of the shows as he&apos;d been doing some work with Rae Morris who was supporting us. I wouldn&apos;t say him being there made me especially nervous but I&apos;d be lying if I said the fact he was there wasn&apos;t at the back of my mind while I was playing. 6 Have you ever had to cancel a show, and why? Only once I think. We were on a US/Canadian tour in early 2012. We&apos;d just played a show in Kamloops and were driving overnight to Calgary. I remember waking up in the middle of the night and wondering why the bus wasn&apos;t moving. When we got up in the morning (and were on the move again) we heard that we&apos;d come across an avalanche. We soon hit another roadblock which was caused by yet another avalanche and it quickly became apparent that we weren&apos;t going to make it to Calgary in time for the show that night. We got diverted to a town called Revelstoke and spent the day there instead. 7 What\u2019s the most embarrassing thing that\u2019s ever happened to you on stage? Jamie our guitarist has had a few spectacular falls on stage in the past. In Singapore a couple of years ago he completely stacked it during Lamplight. Our old guitar tech who was quite small came running over to him, said something like &quot;I&apos;m not even going to try and lift you up,&quot; so Jamie tried to deal with it smoothly by doing some kind of worm motion, hoping that would get him up. It didn&apos;t. Also on our recent UK tour in Newcastle he was getting very into it, tried to jump onto my drum riser during What If, but didn&apos;t jump high enough and just fell into my drum kit. 8 Which is better \u2013 club show or festival?  They both have their perks. when you get a good festival crowd it&apos;s difficult to beat that buzz \u2013 a lot of our best gig memories are from festivals. Playing outdoors in the daytime at a festival, it can sometimes be difficult to build up much of a vibe, but when you&apos;re playing at night time or you&apos;re in a tent, that can often be the recipe for a great gig. Obviously festival sets tend to be shorter than your own headline sets and there will also be a lot of people there who might not know you, so festival sets tend to be more of a &quot;greatest hits&quot; whereas you can afford to make the set more of a journey dynamically if it&apos;s your own club show. 9 Who would you most like to appear on stage with? Jack and I went to see an insane tabla player called Yogesh Samsi at the Darbar festival last year. It would be great if he was up for playing some tabla on Luna live one day. 10 What\u2019s the best show you\u2019ve ever seen as a fan?  Probably Radiohead at Reading festival in 2009. The near-perfect setlist combined with their spectacular light show made for a very special night.

The idea is that new stories of amateur teams defeating state league sides, former National Soccer League teams beating A-League clubs, and bush teams knocking out city clubs will strengthen the game as a whole. Of course, these stories will add to a history already rich with memories and rivalries. Here, new stories may help us reconnect with old ones. The Australia Cup, held from 1962 to 1968, is the elephant in the room. FFA missed an opportunity to name the new knockout Cup after the old one, but the shape of the trophy, according to FFA chief executive David Gallop, \u201chas an interesting connection to the old Australia Cup\u201d. Meetings have been convened at FFA Headquarters, names have been put forward, and soon we will be asked to vote in an internet poll for the name of the FFA Cup final\u2019s man of the match medal. It is an important opportunity to recognise a player who has contributed significantly to Australian football. Since 1990, the player of the season in the domestic competition has been awarded the Johnny Warren Medal, and the man of the match in the grand final has been awarded the Joe Marston Medal. The John Kosmina Medal is awarded to the player of the grand final in the state-based National Premier Leagues. In choosing a name, FFA has many options. Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Craig Johnston, Brett Emerton \u2013 these are all names that will bring the FFA Cup the prestige and recognition it craves. Look a little further back, however, and one name stands out. ** Attila Abonyi arrived in Australia as a 10-year-old in 1957, fleeing Hungary with his parents after the Soviet Union crushed the Hungarian Uprising. He joined many thousands of Magyars who arrived in Australia, first fleeing fascism and then communism. Les Murray, Frank Lowy, Marcel Nagy, Andrew Dettre, Andrew Lederer and Alex Pongrass are just a few of the Hungarian emigres who are steeped in Australian football folklore.  The Hungarians, as political scientist James Jupp notes in his doorstop book The Australian People: an Encyclopedia of the Nation, Its People and their Origins, were largely political refugees, not economic migrants. The \u201cfifty-sixers\u201d as they came to be known, were \u201cover-represented\u201d by well-educated migrants, while \u201cpeasants were largely absent from this group.\u201d The way Les Murray tells it in his biography By The Balls: Memoirs of a Football Tragic, \u201cit was their football, their business acumen, and their sense of bohemia.\u201d  But Abonyi was just a child when he arrived in Melbourne, and he was thrust into local football in St Kilda. Of course, the sport being what it was back then, it wasn\u2019t long before the young Abonyi joined one of the clubs that had been formed to spread the Magyar name \u2013 Melbourne Hungaria. \u201cSt Kilda didn\u2019t have a senior side,\u201d Abonyi explains from his home in Coffs Harbour. \u201c1960 is when Melbourne Hungaria actually got promoted to the Victorian State League. The fact that they had to have a senior side and St Kilda didn\u2019t, we thought maybe with a bit of luck we\u2019d make it eventually.\u201d Coming through the ranks of Melbourne Hungaria, by 1962, Abonyi made his senior debut as a 15 year old in the old Victorian State League. \u201cI was nervous, I was excited, I was happy, but more nervous than anything else,\u201d says Abonyi with his trademark twang. \u201cIt was a big thing, you know?\u201d That same year, the Australia Cup was established, with SSC Yugal from Sydney defeating St George-Budapest to become the inaugural champions. Budapest were a sister club to Melbourne Hungaria, having been formed in 1957 by Sydney members of the diaspora. With Sydney at the centre of Australian football, it was unsurprising that Melbourne Hungaria would live in St George-Budapest\u2019s shadow. But while St George won state and National Soccer League titles, they never lifted the Australia Cup. Melbourne Hungaria did, during one dream season in 1967. Atti Abonyi, then just 21, would play a starring role in the final. ** By 1963, Australia had been readmitted to Fifa and was experiencing a boom period. \u201cThe air was infused with the spirit of triumph which encouraged innovative and sometimes extravagant thinking, a kind of dreaming aloud,\u201d wrote football historian Trevor Thompson of the early 1960s. However, by 1967 crowds were declining, particularly in Sydney, and incidents of violence didn\u2019t help the perception of the sport. New ways of reinvigorating football were floated, including a national league. In 1967 a report recommended a 12 team competition, but the biggest state, New South Wales, rejected the model. The Australia Cup would remain the pinnacle of Australian football. 1967 was also a significant year for the Australian national team, who were sent to Vietnam for a friendship tournament in November. The prime minister, Harold Holt, along with the Australian Soccer Federation, decided to send the team on a propaganda mission to support and entertain the troops. The initial squad selection announced in late September highlighted the problem of not having a national league. Ridiculously, 27 players were selected from 18 different clubs - from Coalstars in Brisbane to Cottesloe in Perth to Croatia in Melbourne. In a squad that former national team manager Jim Bayutti said \u201csmacked of politics\u201d, every state was represented as state selectors wielded their influence. Melbourne Hungaria had just one representative: Attila Abonyi.  Around the same time, the Australia Cup was reaching its latter stages. The final was to be held at Olympic Park in Melbourne, but Sydney teams APIA Leichhardt and St George-Budapest were firm favourites for the Cup. After their dominant season in the New South Wales State League, they had finished first and second respectively before St George-Budapest defeated APIA in the grand final. Despite the fact that Sydney was the strongest state, Melbourne teams were well represented. The final 16 included the Melbourne-based Hungaria, Juventus, Croatia and Footscray JUST. The other sides were a potpourri of Italian, Hungarian, Greek, Croatian and \u2018Australian\u2019 teams from around the country \u2013 Launceston United, Hellas Adelaide, Juventus Adelaide, Azzurri Perth, Juventus Canberra, Lake Macquarie, South Sydney Croatia, Newcastle Austral, Pan Hellenic from Sydney and Latrobe from Brisbane. Melbourne Hungaria were certainly not as small as Launceston or Lake Macquarie, but they were still a humble club. \u201cThe set up was terrible back in those days,\u201d Abonyi says. \u201cThere was no floodlights, no nuthin\u2019! Just a soccer pitch, the dressing room was tiny as can be, two showers, half a dozen balls.\u201d Abonyi cackles down the telephone line. \u201cYou think now, Christ, how on earth!\u201d  Indeed, prior to 1967, Melbourne Hungaria had never won anything of note. 1967 remains the apogee of their 30-year history, a fleeting moment where Hungaria were both state and national champions.  ** In early September, Hungaria wrapped up their first ever State League title with a 1-0 win over Hakoah Melbourne at Middle Park. Abonyi was their top goalscorer that season \u2013 \u201c31 goals in 29 games\u201d \u2013 he says proudly. Fittingly, he scored the winner that day against Hakoah. As the State Leagues concluded, attention moved to the Australia Cup. In October, Hungaria defeated Launceston 2-1 in an astonishing match in which Launceston took an unlikely lead after 10 minutes. Hungaria then proceeded to hit the crossbar a couple of times, the post three times and the side netting on half a dozen occasions, before they scored two goals in the final five minutes. Abonyi scored the first to bring his team level before Frank McCann got the winner. The Age said they were \u201clucky\u201d to win. Abonyi would score another as Hungaria swept aside Croatia Melbourne in the next round, and history beckoned. Never before had the winners of the New South Wales and Victorian State Leagues met in the Australia Cup final, but on the other side of the draw, APIA Leichhardt had breezed past Juventus Canberra and Lake Macquarie, winning 5-0 and 7-1 respectively. A dream Cup final loomed. APIA Leichhardt were home to John Watkiss, Johnny Warren\u2019s best mate as a kid and one of Australia\u2019s most versatile players. He had scored four goals against Lake Macquarie and two against Juventus. A clash between APIA and Hungaria would bring together him and Abonyi, at that point two of the most dangerous finishers in the country. APIA Leichhardt defeated Sydney rivals Pan Hellenic 3-2 to qualify for the final, while Melbourne Hungaria beat Juventus Melbourne 2-0. One goal up after 60 minutes, Hungaria held their lead until the final two minutes, when Abonyi popped up with a goal to put his team into the finals. The Australia Cup champion would be rewarded with the famous trophy, \u00a35,000 prize money and most importantly, a place in the record books. \u201cThe year before [1966] was the first time we qualified for the Australia Cup,\u201d says Abonyi. \u201cWe got into the semi-final against APIA up in Sydney, and they hammered us 3-0. \u201cThey belted us, it could have been more. You can imagine when \u201867 came around, we were still well and truly underdogs. The odds would\u2019ve been 10-1. They were such a great side.\u201d Soccer World, a Sydney based newspaper, sent Lou Gautier and Andrew Dettre to cover the final. \u201cIt&apos;s impossible to see APIA losing on Sunday,\u201d Gautier wrote, and even the paper\u2019s Melbourne correspondent, Bob Low, had to agree. \u201cMelbourne are a team of triers\u201d, said Low, \u201ctheir defence is shaky.\u201d John Watkiss, rather than Abonyi, was named as the man to watch. Held at Olympic Park, the Australia Cup final of 1967 remains one of the greatest finals in Australian football history. Vincent Basile\u2019s match report for the Age describes \u201ca superb match of fast, entertaining soccer \u2026 Play swung from end to end and teams matched goal for goal to keep the result in doubt until the final whistle.\u201d  Abonyi scored the first on 19 minutes. APIA equalised. Abonyi scored again on 53 minutes, but again it was cancelled out by the opposition. On 74 minutes Hungaria\u2019s other striker, Frank Stoffels, put his side ahead, but Watkiss made it 3-3 with a 30-yard piledriver with just a few minutes remaining. Five minutes into extra time, Abonyi \u2013 who had so often been Hungaria\u2019s saviour \u2013 completed his hat-trick to win the Australia Cup for his boyhood club.  For someone with a razor sharp memory, the Cup final remains a blind spot for Abonyi. I ask him to recount his goals. \u201cNah!\u201d he cackles with that dry, infectious laugh. \u201cI often think about that, shit, it must be 40 years, 45 years ago. I often say to people who ask me \u2018you know I can\u2019t remember any of the three goals in that final\u2019. I know it sounds silly, but I can\u2019t visualise it.\u201d  No matter. The history books show that just over a decade after arriving as a refugee, Abonyi had led his team, and more importantly his community, to the top of Australian football. Unsurprisingly, he was named man of the match.  ** Ethnic based clubs like Melbourne Hungaria cultivated a pride in cultural heritage among newly arrived migrants, but they also played a crucial role in helping their players and their supporters become Australians. \u201cContrary to the myth\u201d, Les Murray wrote of St George-Budapest, \u201csuch ghettos are generally temporary and are rarely forces of permanent social division. They are merely agents of transition, easing the pains of migration and facilitating assimilation.\u201d Abonyi agrees. \u201cBack in those days it was a way out,\u201d he says. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t have a word of English, you know what I mean? But the fact there was a Hungarian soccer club, they could go along and watch every game and mingle with Hungarians. [Melbourne Hungaria] was a social event more than a football club.\u201d Just a few days after the final, the Australian team left for Vietnam for the friendship tournament. Watkiss had been hurt in the cup final against Melbourne Hungaria. \u201cHim and I collided late in the second half, and I actually caught his right knee\u201d says Abonyi. \u201cIt really affected him, and when we came back to Sydney of course he was in the Australian team as well. He did travel to Vietnam in the hope he\u2019d recover. But he never did! John couldn\u2019t train!\u201d With Watkiss injured, Abonyi started every game. In the first match against New Zealand, he bagged a hat trick in a 5-3 win. In a 5-1 win over Singapore a few days later, he scored his third hat-trick in a fortnight. He scored yet again in the 3-2 win in the final over South Korea, and as Australia took home their first ever piece of silverware, Abonyi finished as the tournament\u2019s top goalscorer. Shortly after the final, it was revealed by the coach, &apos;Uncle&apos; Joe Vlasits, revealed Abonyi wasn\u2019t his first choice striker. John Watkiss was. \u201cThe absence of Watkiss was bad enough,\u201d said Vlasits. \u201cI can tell you now that had he been fit, I would have used him as an inside forward in the first match, instead of Abonyi.\u201d Abonyi remembers it well. \u201cTo be quite fair, had he [Watkiss] been fit, I\u2019m sure he would have played and I would have been sitting on the bench. We often used to laugh about that years down the track, you know. \u2018You bloody bastard you did that deliberately!\u2019 Funny how things turn out, hey?\u201d Abonyi laughs again at his good fortune. ** Upon their return to Australia hundreds of adoring fans gave the Socceroos a warm midnight welcome at Sydney Airport. \u201cI was lucky with all those goals,\u201d Abonyi told the press. \u201cBut seriously, it was a pleasure with such partners.\u201d National team selection, however, would take Abonyi away from his beloved Melbourne Hungaria. In Vietnam he roomed with Johnny Warren, who was captain of St George-Budapest. Warren put him in contact with the appropriate people at St George, but Melbourne Hungaria dug their heels in. \u201cA thousand times no,\u201d Hungaria president Andy Kun told the press. \u201cAbonyi is not for sale.\u201d But just weeks after their Australia Cup win, Abonyi&apos;s mind was made up, and he told reporters that he wanted to move to Sydney with his new wife. When asked if he would move to APIA Leichhardt, which was the rumour, Abonyi responded: \u201cOf course not. I was born in Hungary and it\u2019s only natural I want to play for St George-Budapest. Everybody knows \u2013 even if we in Melbourne hate to admit it \u2013 that Sydney is the centre of Australian soccer. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d In Sydney, Abonyi starred in a St George-Budapest side featuring several Socceroos, and was part of the squad that traveled to the 1974 World Cup. In 1975, he became the first Australian to score for Manchester United in a guest appearance against a Queensland XI at Lang Park. From the battlefields of Vietnam to the World Cup in Germany to scoring for Manchester United, few Australian strikers have achieved as much as the man they called \u2018Atti\u2019. \u201c1967\u2026 it was probably my best year,\u201d he says. The Australia Cup was abandoned in 1968. Dettre had forewarned the death of the Cup a year earlier in an editorial for Soccer World. \u201cIt is worth noting in passing that so far every year the rules and regulations of the Australia Cup have been altered,\u201d wrote Dettre. \u201cThis unfortunate trend must be stopped if we hope to build the series into a truly significant, Australia-wide competition.\u201d A lesson, perhaps, that FFA might remember. Melbourne Hungaria folded not long after. There are few remnants of that remarkable season in 1967. In the Melbourne Museum, however, there is a booklet titled Melbourne SC: The First Twenty Five Years. On the cover is the old green, red and white badge \u2013 the national colours of Hungary \u2013 and an artwork of their favourite son, Attila Abonyi, holding the Australia Cup.  Atti now lives on the North Coast of New South Wales, away from the game. He still works a day job, just as he did throughout his playing career. He earns an honest living, and lives the quiet life. Like so many before and after him, politics drove him out of the game.  A more fitting name for the FFA Cup player of the match winners medal would be hard to find. Atti\u2019s hat-trick in the 1967 Australia Cup remains one of, if not the greatest performance by an Australian in a grand final. His is a very Australian story, but it is also a quintessential Cup story, full of the David and Goliath romance. The importance we place on its preservation, and the role we grant stories like these in a new era, is a chance to define who we are and what we are proud of as a football nation.

The proposed line would begin in north-east China and run up through Siberia, pass through a tunnel underneath the Pacific Ocean then cut through Alaska and Canada to reach the continental US, according to a report in the state-run Beijing Times newspaper. Crossing the Bering Strait in between Russia and Alaska would require about 200km (125 miles) of undersea tunnel, the paper said, citing Wang Mengshu, a railway expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering. &quot;Right now we&apos;re already in discussions. Russia has already been thinking about this for many years,&quot; Wang said. The project \u2013 nicknamed the &quot;China-Russia-Canada-America&quot; line \u2013 would run for 13,000km, about 3,000km further than the Trans-Siberian Railway. The entire trip would take two days, with the train travelling at an average of 350km/h (220mph). The reported plans leave ample room for skepticism. No other Chinese railway experts have come out in support of the proposed project. Whether the government has consulted Russia, the US or Canada is also unclear. The Bering Strait tunnel alone would require an unprecedented feat of engineering \u2013 it would be the world&apos;s longest undersea tunnel \u2013 four times the length of the Channel Tunnel. According to the state-run China Daily, the tunnel technology is &quot;already in place&quot; and will be used to build a high-speed railway between the south-east province of Fujian and Taiwan. &quot;The project will be funded and constructed by China,&quot; it said. &quot;The details of this project are yet to be finalised.&quot; The Beijing Times listed the China-US line as one of four international high-speed rail projects currently in the works. The first is a line that would run from London via Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Kiev and Moscow, where it would split into two routes, one of which would run to China through Kazakhstan and the other through eastern Siberia. The second line would begin in the far-western Chinese city of Urumqi and then run through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey to Germany. The third would begin in the south-western city of Kunming and end in Singapore. The routes are under various stages of planning and development, the paper said. Wang was not immediately available for comment. A man who picked up the phone at his office said he was traveling and would not respond to interview requests.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 9 May 2014.

But apart from a few middle-aged white men in expensive suits walking purposefully around Road Town, and nameplates showing that the world&apos;s biggest accountancy firms have offices here, there&apos;s barely anything in this small Caribbean capital to suggest that the British Virgin Islands is the world centre of offshore financial secrecy, corporate ownership, trust funds, paper companies and complex structures designed to avoid and possibly evade national financial regulation. According to the BVI&apos;s government, Road Town is home to about 13,500 people, one million corporations and half the world&apos;s offshore companies. The tiny British tax haven has plenty of poor people, but the offshore companies based there held more than $615bn in assets in 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund, and last year attracted more than $92bn of direct investment \u2013 more than went to India and Brazil combined. A single building in the capital is reputed to be home to more than 90,000 companies. But there are no names on the few brass plaques to be seen, no public lists of owners or directors available in the government&apos;s Financial Services Commission building on the Road Town Pasea Estate, no financial reports or addresses beyond anonymous PO box numbers. Around 100 firms in Road Town will set up, administer and keep secret an anonymous company for around $1,500 \u2013 few questions asked. The money might spend only seconds in the relevant electronic accounts, but the British Virgin Islands is the preferred domicile of most of the world&apos;s wealthy corporations and individuals. In China, it is said, you have not succeeded until you have set up your own subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands. So it was no great surprise last year, when it emerged in Indonesian supreme court documents that the giant palm oil branch of the Royal Golden Eagle International conglomerate of forestry, rubber and palm plantation companies, owned by the billionaire tycoon Sukanto Tanoto, was using a web of shell companies based in Road Town and other tax havens to enable its palm oil companies to evade tax. But what astonished corporate-watchers was how its subsidiary, the agribusiness giant Asian Agri, was operating. According to evidence contained in the 8,000 court papers, the group, which employs 25,000 people across 14 subsidiaries and owns 165,000 hectares of plantations, was engaged in routine and systematic fraudulent accounting practices. Using European and US banks, as well as the auditing services of international accounting firms and paper companies based at Portcullis TrustNet Chambers, PO Box 3444 Road Town, they and their fictitious subsidiaries sold vast quantities of palm oil to other fictitious affiliates in Hong Kong, Macao and in the BVI at an artificially low price. In a process known as transfer pricing, the commodities were then sold on at a higher price to real buyers, thus avoiding higher taxes in Indonesia. In only one of thousands of transactions, Asian Agri&apos;s subsidiary, PT Inti Indsawit Subur, sold 999.3 tonnes of palm oil in August 2001 to Asian Agri Abadi Oil and Fats for $192,335. This company then sold it on to international commodity dealers for $219,846, reaping a profit of $27,511. In another transaction highlighted in the case, 2,500 tonnes of palm oil was sold to a fictitious Hong Kong company, then to a fictitious BVI company and eventually on to a genuine Malaysian company, banking a profit for Asian Agri of $154,500. Court documents also provide evidence of mass production of fake invoices as well as fake hedging contracts. The Indonesian supreme court estimated that Asian Agri Group (AAG) evaded $112m of tax over a few years and ruled that the company must pay $205m in fines as well as the taxes owed. But Indonesia&apos;s anti-corruption officials are so short of resources that, until the AAG case, no major company had been successfully prosecuted for corporate tax evasion and it took a whistleblower to provide the key papers to prove wrongdoing. In scenes reminiscent of a Hollywood thriller, Vincentius Amin Sutanto, AAG&apos;s financial controller, was accused of embezzling $3.1m of company funds, but escaped to Singapore on a fake passport, taking with him documents which, he claimed, could prove illegal activities at the company. He was later convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to 11 years in prison in Indonesia. The Asian Agri case, which continues to reverberate in Indonesia, has had repercussions across the world. The British government, which is implicated because of the involvement of British overseas territories, recently met Indonesian investigators and others and signed a memorandum of cooperation. It says it wants to push tax evasion and money laundering up the agenda of the G8. The European parliament has cited the case in arguments that timber imports from Indonesia must be shown to be free of tax evasion and money laundering. But the case also raises questions about whether AAG&apos;s tax evasion is a one-off or whether other south-east Asian forestry and palm conglomerates are also using British territories. Indonesia&apos;s forests, the second biggest swath in the world after the Amazon, have been a wild west in the past 30 years, according to the World Bank and others. A few companies have together deforested tens of millions of square kilometres of virgin forest and built up a reputation for illegal felling, human rights abuses and ruthless land-grabbing. According to a 2011 Interpol report written in conjunction with the World Bank, the Indonesian government &quot;could be losing $2bn a year in unpaid taxes and charges \u2026 due to the activities of just 18 illegal logging syndicates&quot;. Data seen by the Observer suggests an investigation of the sector is needed. &quot;Large-scale palm oil and paper and pulp companies active in Indonesia have shell companies in the BVI, making this jurisdiction one of the preferred choices of Indonesian forest conglomerates. Two other UK-linked jurisdictions, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, are also used by forest conglomerates,&quot; says one document. &quot;Due to a lack of transparency of these shell companies, it is difficult to document reasons for the use of these companies, including whether they are being used to reduce income and/or withholding taxes legitimately or otherwise,&quot; it says. &quot;For some privately held companies, data is not available. For other companies, an examination of \u2026 the analysis of effective tax rates and/or return on sales showed patterns over a longer period which are difficult to understand and raise questions which merit further research and investigation,&quot; says another document. Back in the British Virgin Islands, fraud investigators say they are swamped by financial crime. &quot;It is overwhelming how big the cases are getting,&quot; said Martin Kenney, a Canadian tax lawyer, speaking in his Road Town office. &quot;There&apos;s more money in the world, and more structures mean more secrecy. The evidence suggests the frequency and the size of the frauds [taking place] is changing dramatically.&quot; In 22 years of working for governments and corporations, Kenney says he has traced around $3bn, including money stolen by the former Nigerian president Sani Abacha. &quot;We look down the value train and see where the money has been taken [into] a labyrinth of legal structures, all designed to make our work unbearably complex and tricky,&quot; he said. The financial intelligence units of the UK and Indonesian governments met recently at Chatham House in London to explore ways to work together. &quot;There is growing awareness of the scale of the problem, as well as some successful prosecutions \u2013 most notably, the recent case of Asian Agri,&quot; said Alison Hoare, a Chatham House researcher. &quot;One problem has been a lack of understanding that the forestry sector is a high-risk sector for financial crime. The application of risk assessment by the regulatory authorities has not been sufficiently rigorous.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/datablog/2014/may/12/world-most-powerful-cities-data", "sentences": ["The ranking is led by the &quot;classic&quot; city-states \u2013 Luxembourg, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, places where the city essentially is the country."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-12T10:18:24Z", "title": "The age of the city-state: which cities most dominate their countries?", "tags": ["Cities", "World news"], "article": "It is frequently cited that more than half of us now live in cities.

From the man who promised no new taxes, and argued that \u201cno country has ever taxed its way to prosperity,\u201d here come the new taxes. This reveals more than a prime ministerial hypocrisy. It also makes clear the lie that is the \u201cbudget emergency.\u201d If the budget were replete with wasteful Labor spending that could be cut, as Tony Abbott kept telling Australians before the election, there would be no need for tax hikes. The Coalition appeared to believe their political lines actually constituted fiscal policy. But they didn\u2019t, and they won\u2019t. Abbott\u2019s addiction to scare campaigns is well known. From claiming whole cities would be wiped off the map to the budget emergency, facts are sacrificed in pursuit of a political objective. But not one of the prime minister\u2019s claims about the budget stacks up against a simple fact check.   Claim: Australia has a budget emergency Nations with budget emergencies don\u2019t receive AAA ratings with a stable outlook from all three credit rating agencies, as Australia did under Labor.  Australia is one of only 10 economies in the world with AAA ratings from all three agencies \u2013 in the company of other countries with strong public finances like Germany, Canada, Sweden, Singapore and Switzerland. This status shows our finances are considered to be stronger than those of the vast majority of advanced economies \u2013 including the US, the UK, Japan, France and New Zealand.   Claim: Debt levels are unsustainable The Australian government has low levels of debt by world standards. The latest budget update shows net government debt for 2013-14 of $191.5bn, or 12.1% of Australia\u2019s GDP. By contrast, net government debt in advanced economies around the world averages 74.7%, according to the International Monetary Fund.   Claim: Labor\u2019s deficits were too high Governments typically run budget surpluses when the economy is strong and deficits when the economy is weak. Labor allowed the budget to go into deficit in 2008-09 because the global financial crisis was threatening to plunge our economy into recession. Our action stimulated the economy, kept Australia out of recession and supported hundreds of thousands of jobs. The deficit peaked at $54.5bn, or 4.2% of GDP, in 2009-10 \u2013 less than half the advanced country average. Then, as the private sector started recovering, Labor started reducing the deficit. In our last full year in office, 2012-13, the federal deficit was $18.8bn or 1.2% of GDP, compared to an advanced economy average of 4.9%. Claim: Spending was out of control In the four years from 2009-10 to 2012-13 Labor met its fiscal rule of keeping real average spending growth to less than 2% a year. In fact, this was the lowest four-year period of real spending growth in 23 years. The Abbott government arrives at a higher figure for political purposes by including the 2008-09 stimulus \u2013 an economic program the Nobel laureate, economist Joseph Stiglitz, has described as one of the \u201cbest designed\u201d stimulus packages of any advanced economy. Claim: Labor increased taxes Labor was a low-taxing government. During our time in office, federal government receipts averaged 22.5% of GDP. By contrast, under the Howard government, receipts averaged 25% of GDP. Claim: Debt will reach $667bn by the end of the decade The budget\u2019s debt and deficit figures have been inflated by Joe Hockey through a combination of spending decisions and changes to economic assumptions, such as unemployment projections. These changes doubled projected budget deficits by $68bn and have also blown out debt figures. These political changes in Budget assumptions were confirmed by Treasury at Senate estimates hearings earlier this year. By contrast, the independent pre-election economic and fiscal outlook\u2019s medium term projections, using long-standing methodology, show that on Labor\u2019s policy settings the budget surplus grows to 1% of GDP in 2020-21 and net debt returns to zero in 2023-24.   Claim: Labor\u2019s school and disability reforms are not funded In the 2013-14, budget labor took the unprecedented step of releasing 10 year figures for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Gonski school reforms, demonstrating how they were funded over the long term. The Coalition has reversed a number of these savings measures and now claims these reforms represent a fiscal \u201ctime bomb\u201d \u2013 this is an obvious attempt to justify breaking Abbott\u2019s election promises on schools and disability. The result: Labor v the Coalition It is the case that structural improvements in the budget are needed to ensure key spending is sustainable. That\u2019s why Labor made targeted savings worth more than $180bn over the six Budgets since 2008-09. Savings like means testing the private health insurance rebate, removing the baby bonus and reforming the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, rather than hiking income tax and cutting benefits to low and middle income families. Treasury analysis shows that the long-term savings made by Labor mean the budget is cumulatively more than $300bn better off by 2020-21. Political deceit may have provided Abbott with an expedient path to office, but it represents a shaky foundation for responsible economic and Budget management."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/13/nathan-tinkler-in-airport-departure-lounge-days-before-icac-appearance", "sentences": ["A representative for Tinkler told Fairfax Media Tinkler was in Singapore, but was leaving &quot;in the next day or so&quot; and would &quot;definitely be appearing on Friday at ICAC&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-13T03:29:15Z", "title": "Nathan Tinkler 'in airport departure lounge' days before Icac appearance", "tags": ["Australian politics", "Australia news"], "article": "Former mining billionaire Nathan Tinkler has reportedly been seen about to board an international flight, just days before he is due to appear at the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The truth is that some children are so disadvantaged that it affects their brain functioning to such a level that they can&apos;t even sit still or stay calm in school \u2013 never mind pass exams. We&apos;re seeing a lot of schools trying to get rid of their most vulnerable pupils because they are having an impact on their attainment levels. I&apos;d like to see some kind of measure introduced that rewards schools for dealing with the more disturbed and challenging pupils. Unless this happens, things aren&apos;t going to change. Ros McMullen, executive principal of David Young Community Academy, Leeds     Ros McMullen Photograph: Victor de Jesus/UNP    I&apos;d love to see more boarding school provision in the state sector. I say this because some children don&apos;t fail at school for educational reasons. They fail because of problems in their home life that the school cannot do anything about. It&apos;s not about taking children away from their parents; if we could take children as boarders for maybe eight or 10 weeks, give them a breather from what&apos;s going on at home, and help them get into good learning habits, I think it would seriously address disadvantage. David Bell, vice-chancellor, Reading University     David Bell Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian    I&apos;d like to see all party manifestos making a strong commitment to invest in science and research \u2013 something that&apos;s desperately needed if the UK is to continue to punch above its weight. This comes at a price, but the price of not investing is far higher. I&apos;d also like to see an inflation-related rise in tuition fees and some serious discussion \u2013 across all three parties \u2013 about how the student funding system might look in that future. It&apos;s not just about tuition fees; we also need to look at how the UK is going to continue to support the expansion of higher education in the future. We&apos;ve had over 30 education acts in as many years, so I&apos;d like a new government that could make change without resorting to new legislation and all the turbulence and turmoil that follows behind it. Anthony Seldon, headteacher of Wellington College public school, Berkshire     Anthony Seldon Photograph: Rex Features    I&apos;d like a see a new government that&apos;s brave enough to do away with GCSEs and introduce the International Baccalaureate. The fact that our kids grow up in this global world and we have a diddy national education system with quaint little exams called GCSEs is madness. The IB is the best exam system in the world, and everyone should be doing it. A bigger emphasis on character education would also be good. Unfortunately, some of the advisers in our current government made the terrible mistake of thinking the development of good character is somehow the enemy of academic excellence. But if we are trying to build good atmospheres in schools, and get kids to grow up to become good employees, then turning up on time, being responsible, civil, polite, caring, thoughtful and honest \u2013 they need to know these things. Russell Hobby, general secretary, NAHT     Russell Hobby Photograph: Martin Godwin    David Blunkett&apos;s recent review of education reinforces the Labour party&apos;s commitment to the restoration of qualified teacher status (QTS) which is a good thing. Also welcome is the proposal for the Director of School Standards \u2013 which ties together academies, free schools and local authority schools. But I think that any new government will need to invest serious money in the recruitment and retention of school leaders \u2013 particularly in the most challenging schools. Over the next five years, we&apos;re going to need thousands more headteachers, but the number of applicants is plummeting. Some of that might be about addressing some of the pressures of the job. There are a lot of people who are deputy heads who are saying, &quot;Why on earth would I become a headteacher? I&apos;ve got a leadership role, I&apos;ve got responsibility and so on, but I don&apos;t have to deal with the amount of rubbish that comes along with that.&quot; The government is going to have to look at the level of risk associated with taking on challenging schools. Jonathan Savage, reader in education at the Institute of Education, Manchester     Jonathan Savage    I&apos;d like a rethink on the way we structure the school year. Under the current system, children born in the summer months can be hugely disadvantaged compared to those born in the autumn, who are always the oldest in their year group. Teaching by ability not age would help, but this would require radical change in how we deliver the curriculum. Andrew Old, maths teacher and education blogger     Andrew Old    Let&apos;s scrap performance-related pay. The teacher labour market was already a mess, but the introduction of this has made things even worse. When you have different schools having different rules around pay and conditions it&apos;s damaging to morale. Teachers don&apos;t like being compared, even when good things are being pointed out \u2013 it just makes them paranoid that they&apos;ll be criticised for not being so good in the future. People making half-formed judgments about their performance \u2013 whether it&apos;s their managers, Ofsted or anyone else \u2013 is just not helpful. Sean Dellenty, deputy headteacher, Alfred Salter primary school, Southwark, London; founder of Inclusion for All     Shaun-Dellenty    My key policy would be mandatory initial teacher training to prevent bullying linked to sexual orientation, transgender and intersex issues. I regularly hear stories from people who&apos;ve passed through our education system whose lives have been damaged by homophobic, biphobic or transphobic bullying. We must ensure teachers are confident from the outset in fostering schools that are safe and inclusive for all children; policy level is where this starts. Sarah Steel, managing director, The Old Station nursery, Gloucestershire     Sarah Steel Photograph: Anna Draper    We have to sort out the funding for early years childcare. For almost a decade now, the government has been offering free childcare for all three- and four-year-olds for up to 15 hours a week. Now this has been extended to thousands of two-year-olds. But funding varies between local authorities and is rarely enough to cover the real cost. I know of one local authority that gives nurseries just \u00a32.50 an hour to cover the cost of its free childcare provision \u2013 you can&apos;t park your car for \u00a32.50 these days. Both the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats are talking about increasing free childcare too. It may be a vote pleaser with parents, but if that policy goes ahead it could put a lot of nurseries out of business. The solution would be to set a national hourly rate for local authorities to pay childcare providers. Everyone in the sector knows that&apos;s what should happen so why can&apos;t politicians see it? Peter Hyman, former adviser to Tony Blair, founder and headteacher of School 21, a free school in Newham, London     Peter Hyman Photograph: r/Richard Saker    The recent decision to drop the speaking and listening component from the English GCSE was a bad one. It&apos;s not about debating clubs; it&apos;s about helping children develop self-confidence and thinking skills \u2013 the kinds of things employers look for. And there&apos;s something very illogical about that decision: we assess children&apos;s oral communication skills in French or German, so why not in English? It&apos;s a pattern that is being repeated right across the curriculum; exams are getting narrower, so they are a snapshot of what a child can remember on a given day rather than a test of their true abilities. So that&apos;s something I&apos;d definitely like to see a new government addressing. In fact, I think the GCSE should be abolished completely. With the school-leaving age rising to 18 next year \u2013 something all of the political parties seem to agree is a good idea \u2013 what exactly is the point of having an exam at 16? It just gets in the way. Claudette Patey, music teacher, Hazelwick school, Crawley     Claudette Patey    The benefits of learning a musical instrument are well documented, but there&apos;s always been a big divide between children whose parents can afford to pay for music lessons and those who can&apos;t. Pupil premium funding [additional cash given to schools to help children from more disadvantaged backgrounds] has given more children the chance to learn a musical instrument. But that can only go so far. I&apos;d love to see instrumental lessons for all primary children. Heidi Spalding, parent, County Antrim     Heidi Spalding    I&apos;d like to see the end of homework. It causes parents untold stress, disrupts family life, and kids see it as pointless. I think voluntary homework is an interesting idea. I&apos;ve noticed that whenever my children are given an optional project \u2013 make an Easter bonnet, a 3D model or a film, for example, they always want to do it \u2013 when ordinarily we have tears over homework every night. Recognising that not all learning is desk-based with paper and pen is important and would be far more effective than setting pointless tasks every night, which is what many schools seem to be doing. John Tomsett, headteacher, Huntingdon school, York and member of the Headteachers&apos; Roundtable thinktank     John Tomsett    The Headteachers&apos; Roundtable recently published its own election manifesto. Top of the list is great teaching; so much of the policy change over the last four years has been about structures and accountability, we&apos;ve lost sight of the basics. That&apos;s why we&apos;d like to see a professional development programme leading to qualified teacher status (QTS) after a maximum of two years&apos; induction and a master&apos;s-level professional qualification after five years. We&apos;d also like to see a national fund to attract talented teachers to schools in the most deprived areas and a three-year contract for headteachers who take on the most challenging schools. At the moment, they&apos;re only ever a couple of Ofsteds away from losing their jobs, which makes it a very unattractive proposition for people with children, mortgages and other commitments. Brett Wigdortz, founder and chief executive of Teach First     Brett Wigdortz Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    I&apos;ve visited China, Finland and Singapore recently, where they have some of the best education systems in the world. One of the most striking things they have in common is cross-party, long-term educational strategies, especially around testing and measuring achievement. Compare that to the UK, where we seem to be changing testing regimes every few years \u2013 it&apos;s very damaging. So my dream would be a new government that recognises the need for cross-party consensus on what we want our schools to achieve and has a long-term plan for getting there. Siobhan Easton, teacher, Marine academy, a primary free school in Plymouth     Siobhan Easton    The pupil premium has been one of the most successful policies introduced by the coalition government. We&apos;re based in an area with high levels of social deprivation and low aspirations, so we&apos;ve used the money to fund extra-curricular clubs like running, dancing, arts and crafts \u2013 the kinds of activities that help children develop their social skills, ambitions and aspirations. I hope this funding will continue. Paul White, deputy vice-chancellor, Sheffield University     Paul White    If the Conservatives get back into power, we&apos;ll definitely need more regulation of private higher education institutions. The coalition neglected to put forward a higher education bill, so there isn&apos;t any legislation to help with quality control. But if any private provision is found to be of a poor standard, it will reflect badly on the whole sector. Higher education has a big role to play in the UK economy \u2013 we can&apos;t afford to risk our reputation. Catherine Berry, parent, Kent     Catherine Berry    I&apos;d like to see the creation of a schools-based mental health service for young people. The child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) is inadequate. It&apos;s completely overstretched, with long waiting lists and high staff turnover, which means that even those children who manage to get help don&apos;t always get consistent treatment and support. Schools do try and help, even though they haven&apos;t the resources to do so. But many pupils with untreated mental health issues fall behind with their work or even stop attending school altogether. Having fought for support for my own child, I know that sometimes you have to shout quite loud to get help. What about the children who don&apos;t have anyone to fight their corner? Louise French, lecturer in motor engineering at Bournemouth and Poole College     louise french    We&apos;re already seeing the impact of the coalition&apos;s decision to hand responsibility for careers information, advice and guidance over to schools \u2013 without any additional funding to do so. Many of the young people I meet have no idea of the opportunities available to them when they leave school, like apprenticeships. They have little idea about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) and any knowledge they do have is outdated. They see a motor vehicle apprenticeship as an easy option, but these days it&apos;s all about understanding electronics, which requires a high level of technical knowledge and expertise. I&apos;d like see our next government focusing on getting better quality Stem teaching in schools. Without that, the Stem industry will struggle to recruit the workforce needed for the future. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers     Christine Blower Photograph: Sam Frost    It was encouraging to hear in David Blunkett&apos;s recent report that if Labour is returned to office, it will ensure all teachers in all state schools are qualified. A return to a national pay scale would also be welcome, as having teachers being paid differently in different schools can lead to staffing problems. We&apos;d also like to see all schools returned to local authority control, so we can ensure there are enough places for children who need them. One of the biggest problems with academies and free schools \u2013 particularly with free schools \u2013 is that we now have schools opening where there is no need, which is a complete waste of taxpayers&apos; money. And now we&apos;re no longer asking kids to leave school at 16, we&apos;d like to see a rethink of the examination system. The point of the GCSEs is that they were terminal exams for some kids because they were actually leaving school. So if they&apos;re not terminal exams any more, why do we need GCSEs? Frances Wadsworth, principal, Croydon College     Frances Wadsworth Photograph: David Baird    I&apos;d like to see more investment in enterprise education for under-25s to encourage our best entrepreneurial and creative minds in setting up small business startups with professionally run funds to support them. Debra Kidd, Advanced Skills Teacher at Saddleworth School in Oldham     Debra Kidd    I&apos;m no fan of Michael Gove, but with Tristram Hunt I see the same old problem: he&apos;s keen to sway voters, so the rhetoric is focused on what he thinks parents want to hear \u2013 saying the same old stuff about falling standards and problems in the system \u2013 rather than offering policy ideas that will make a difference. I&apos;d love to see proposals for a Royal College of Teaching \u2013 an idea that has gained cross-party support \u2013 actually get off the ground. But it must be created by the teaching profession, not the government. Having an independent body working in collaboration with government and ministers to develop policy \u2013 based on proven research \u2013 could really make a difference. Jamie Grimshaw, economics student, University of Swansea     jamie grimshaw    I&apos;d like to see reform of career development loans. I&apos;m applying for master&apos;s degrees at the moment and the maximum I can borrow is \u00a310,000, so I&apos;m looking at how I might be able to top that up with scholarships, grants, business sponsorships or loans from family. While I&apos;m trying to scrape together the money, many of my friends have in effect been priced out of postgraduate study and are looking for work instead. Anna Wise, primary school teacher, Cumbria     anna wise    I&apos;d like to ditch Ofsted and replace it with a partnership, with an experienced education professional \u2013 a kind of &quot;critical friend&quot; \u2013 who works closely with schools to help with self-evaluation. This would be someone who spent regular time at the school, getting to know its strengths and weaknesses \u2013 the story behind the stats. They could be called upon to give a grading and evaluation of the school, without warning, and be externally moderated to ensure consistency. This would be a far more positive approach than the system we have now \u2013 which seems all about putting on the right &quot;performance&quot; during an inspection \u2013 rather than truly making improvements. Catherine Bourne, assistant headteacher, Mascalls School, Kent     Catherine Bourne    I&apos;d get rid of league tables. They&apos;re divisive and force schools into playing games rather than doing what&apos;s right for young people. We try not to be influenced by them, but now many vocational subjects are not recognised in league tables, it&apos;s easy to see why schools might encourage pupils to follow the academic route \u2013 even if that&apos;s not necessarily best for them. To do otherwise means risking poor results, and how many schools would want to do that? League tables are also based on the assumption that all schools are on a level playing field, when clearly they&apos;re not. Location, socio-economic factors and academic selection are just some of the things that affect a school&apos;s &quot;starting point&quot; for exam results. Some will clearly have a head start on others and that&apos;s just not fair. And do we really want to pit schools against each other like that? I don&apos;t. Toby Young, founder of West London Free School     Toby Young  Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    If there&apos;s a change of government, I hope the incoming secretary of state doesn&apos;t reverse any of Michael Gove&apos;s reforms. In particular, I hope they don&apos;t try to remove any of the freedoms enjoyed by academies and I hope they don&apos;t make changes to the new national curriculum, the new accountability measures or the new GCSEs and A-levels. All these reforms need time to bed-in and further changes now would be disruptive. If there isn&apos;t a change of government, I would like to see turbo boosters under the free school programme. The best way to do that would be for the department to adopt a &quot;no default&quot; position when it comes to choosing between charitable and commercial educational management organisations. If a for-profit company can set up, own and operate a free school at less cost to the taxpayer than a charitable organisation, and if it can guarantee above-average pupil outcomes, it shouldn&apos;t be prevented from doing so for ideological reasons."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/may/13/showcase-exporting-the-jackloc-company-limited", "sentences": ["We export our award-winning restrictors to Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Arabia; and are working to expand into further markets."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-13T15:43:36Z", "title": "Exporting: The Jackloc Company Limited", "tags": ["Small Business Showcase"], "article": "Name: The Jackloc Company LimitedCity: LutterworthWebsite: www.jackloc.com  Despite being a small family business set up 11 years ago, our drive, enthusiasm and innovative approach has achieved phenomenal success in reaching a global market.

Minority leader Mitch McConnell and his Republican colleague Lindsey Graham urged Senate majority leader Harry Reid to allow a vote on their proposed bill, called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. It would impose prison sentences of up to five years on doctors carrying out terminations in an estimated 1.5% of later abortion cases that fall between 20 weeks and the current 24-week limit. Though the bill is likely to remain blocked by Reid for now, McConnell said his public call for a vote was intended to put senators on the spot on a controversial issue that Republicans claim is supported in opinion polling. A similar bill was overwhelmingly passed by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last June and would be a top priority for Senate Republicans if they succeed in gaining the six seats need to take charge of the upper chamber in November&apos;s midterm elections. Graham pointed to rare cases of babies surviving after premature births at this stage of pregnancy as a reason to change the law and claimed there was medical evidence that foetuses can also feel pain at this age, although such claims are contested by pro-choice groups. \u201cOur view is that at 20 weeks you are already a member of society,\u201d Graham told a press conference held after a brief Senate debate. \u201cYou need our help and we are here to provide it.\u201d He was joined by a group of pro-life campaigners who said they had chosen today for their announcement because it was the one-year anniversary of the prosecution of rogue Philadelphia abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted of murder after killing babies after they were delivered. Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin, one of several women to talk against the bill on the Senate floor, dismissed its revival by Republican leaders as a \u201cdangerous political game\u201d and questioned the relevance of the Gosnell case, which was tried under existing criminal laws. Democrat senator Richard Blumenthal added: \u201cThe fact of one incident of possible medical malpractice should not justify this sweeping abrogation of a woman&apos;s reproductive rights.\u201d Blumenthal and Baldwin are pushing a rival bill that would permanently bar states from various recent attempts to tighten abortion laws in ways campaigners argue are undermining the legal principle of choice established by the supreme court in Roe v Wade. They also argue that the small number of abortions carried out between 20 and 24 weeks are often necessary due to dangerous medical complications such as pre-eclampsia. \u201cThe majority of medical procedures occur due to health issues that would put the foetus and mother at risk.\u201d said Blumenthal. \u201cUnder this law the doctor would have to wait until she was facing death [before being able to act].&quot; Such arguments are rejected by pro-life groups, who claim it is more humane to allow babies with life-threatening conditions to be born. \u201cIt&apos;s argued that abortion is a necessary option for those very rare cases where there is devastating diagnosis and my heart goes out to those families \u2026 but women who are offered abortion in this situation are being offered a lie,\u201d said Maureen Ferguson of the Catholic Association. \u201cThey are told this is a compassionate choice, but the reality of abortion is a premature and violent end for the baby.

Mark Reilly ran GSK&apos;s operations in China but now risks a jail sentence in the country after he was accused of offences that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. Chinese police claimed that that Reilly and two other Chinese executives, Zhang Guowei and Zhao Hongyan, bribed doctors and hospital officials. The bribery allegations, which will now be passed to prosecutors, were harsher than many Chinese-based executives expected, Reuters reported. The police accused GSK, the UK&apos;s largest pharmaceutical company, of offering billions of yuan in bribes to doctors and other hospital staff in order to boost sales of its products. Although Reilly stood down from running GSK&apos;s China operations last July, he remains an employee. A report by the Chinese state news agency Xinhua highlights the role of the Briton. Zhang, a former vice-president of GSK China, told Xinhua that pressure to increase sales led to the bribery. &quot;When Reilly took over the post, the company&apos;s strategy shifted from profit-oriented to sales-oriented. The sales target in China was raised every year to compensate the reduction in US and European markets.&quot; When allegations of doctors being bribed with \u00a3320m worth of gifts and sexual favours first emerged last year, GSK said the investigation was focused on Chinese executives rather than British managers. GSK declined to comment on the specific allegations against Reilly. But in a statement, it said: &quot;We take the allegations that have been raised very seriously. They are deeply concerning to us and contrary to the values of GSK. &quot;We want to reach a resolution that will enable the company to continue to make an important contribution to the health and welfare of China and its citizens.&quot; Reilly has been working for GSK since 1989, according to his LinkedIn profile. A graduate of University College London, he holds a PhD in pharmacology and an accountancy qualification. He rose up the GSK ranks, doing a variety of commercial jobs that included stints in Singapore, the USA and GSK&apos;s headquarters in London. He took charge of GSK&apos;s operations in China in January 2009, based in Shanghai. He left the country last July when the bribery scandal broke. He later returned and was subsequently barred from leaving. Ten days after the scandal broke Reilly was replaced as GSK&apos;s China boss by Herve Gisserot. Chinese police have not said whether Reilly has been detained, but officials at the British Consulate in Shanghai have said they are in contact with him and providing assistance. GSK is also embroiled in a similar scandal in Poland after a whistleblower, Jarek Wisniewiski, told the BBC&apos;s Panorama programme that company representatives paid doctors to boost prescriptions.

It&apos;s a story about the intense search for energy sources in a world that\u2019s moving away from the dirtiest fossil fuels. Aleqa Hammond, the prime minister of Greenland, is the first woman to lead this autonomous country within the Kingdom of Denmark. She also welcomes the financial opportunities from climate change and a melting Arctic Circle. \u201cI simply refuse to be the victimised people of climate change\u201d, she told Business Week this month. \u201cThis time we have other options than just hunting. We have the right now to our own underground.\u201d In October last year, Hammond pushed legislation through Greenland&apos;s parliament to overturn a 25 year old ban on the extraction of radioactive materials, including uranium, despite countless leading environmental NGOs urging otherwise. It attracted global interest from the rare earth and uranium industries, including from China. Concerns were also raised about Greenland&apos;s ability to manage a toxic substance in the wake of Fukushima and Chernobyl. The company Greenland Minerals and Energy Limited (GMEL) is based in Perth, Western Australia. This year GMEL announced a major step forward in their plan to open one of the world\u2019s largest uranium mines in southern Greenland, at Kvanefjeld. The mine will also produce fluoride, thorium and other rare earths. There is still significant opposition to the Kvanefjeld project. The Ecological Council, a Danish NGO, organised a conference to discuss the potential contamination risks in March, noting that the mine poses serious risks for the inhabitants of the nearby village, Narsaq. Many locals told the BBC that they worried about pollution and challenges to traditional ways of life if GMEL moved ahead with its plans. Unsurprisingly, Danish green groups have pushed for a continued ban on uranium mining. They claim that rare earth elements can be extracted without uranium mining in Greenland.     \u201c[Greenland] is the size of Western Australia but it has no mines.\" Photograph: Visit Greenland/flickr    This would have been an important but fairly typical contest over resources, but after issues surrounding the ownership and status of Perth-based GMEL were raised in the Greenlandic parliament, the prospects of the Australian firm may be in jeopardy. Late last year, Greenland MP Sara Olsvig (tipped by some as a future prime minister) wrote to the country\u2019s minister of industry and minerals, Jens-Erik Kirkegaard. She demanded details about any and all of GMEL\u2019s shareholders, after Australian media outlets had raised allegations about both the company back in 2009 (here and here) and mining prospector Mihran Shemesian, also known as &quot;Mick Many Names&quot;.  In 2009, Fairfax media claimed that Shemesian controlled more than 20% of GMEL stock. Range Resources, another company tied to Shemesian, had earlier been accused of paying the disputed government of the Puntland State of Somalia, linked to Somali rebels, more than $US6m ($A9.3m) for resource rights to the region. Since then, there have been very few stories about him. Kirkegaard responded that the government dismissed any concerns about GMEL \u2013 \u201cthe alleged events all occurred outside Greenland\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d \u2013 and claimed that the company didn\u2019t own an exploration license anyway, so there was nothing to worry about. This isn&apos;t quite the case: Greenland Minerals and Energy A/S (GME), the firm granted the licence, is the wholly-owned Greenlandic subsidiary of GMEL. So is &quot;Mick Many Names&quot; Shemesian involved with GMEL? John Mair, the company&apos;s executive director, told me he isn&apos;t \u201cregistered as a shareholder\u201d. But he would not guarantee that Shemesian has no involvement with GMEL. Mair is proud of the Kvanefjed project, where \u201crisks can be appropriately mitigated\u201d. GMEL was \u201cworking with Greenland to help establish a secure and viable economy that will help sustain their increasing political independence,\u201d he told me, adding that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d GMEL would be granted a mining license in the foreseeable future because \u201cwe have much local community support in Greenland\u201d. A key shareholder in GMEL is Perth-based geologist Greg Barnes, founder and CEO of Tanbreez. He told me by phone from Singapore that he has personally invested $40m towards mining possibilities in Greenland. He says he has known Shemesian for 30 years and \u201chas heard that he has a 50% share in GMEL and I\u2019ve heard that he has 0%. I have no relationship with him.\u201d But in December last year he told Gr\u00f8nlandsposten, a Greenlandic newspaper that, \u201che and Shemesian could probably fire GMEL\u2019s board if they wanted to\u201d. He told me that this referred to the make-up of GMEL many years ago \u2013 not today. \u201c[Greenland] is the size of Western Australia but it has no mines\u201d, he said. \u201cIn Western Australia an application for mining would take three months but in Greenland it takes years.\u201d A vast part of Greenland has been \u201cstaked out by a number of Perth companies.\u201d Barnes isn\u2019t concerned about climate change \u201cbecause it didn\u2019t really show up in places like Greenland apart from some ice sheets reducing\u201d. There is another view. Niels Henrik Hooge is a Danish consultant who works with green NGOs. He\u2019s been at the forefront of the campaign against uranium mining in Greenland. He says to me that the people of Greenland are \u201csplit down the middle regarding the repeal of the [uranium] ban.\u201d  Hooge explains that the \u201cmineral authorities\u201d have fed the public disinformation over the last years but the tide may be turning, with growing concerns over environmental effects and the leftist party Inuit Ataqatigiit pledging to roll back the repeal if it wins back power.  The prospect of a relatively unknown Australian company exploiting massive untapped resources in Greenland deserves a robust public and political debate. It has thus far received nothing in Australia, and little in Denmark and Greenland. In an age of worsening climate change, mining uranium is an arguably unsafe and potentially explosive answer to the problem.

Over the years, it grew to become a midsized industrial powerhouse, known as \u201cGlass City\u201d for its glass-making companies, and also as the \u201cAuto Parts Capital of the World\u201d (Detroit is only 60 miles away). Like much of the Rust Belt, deindustrialisation hit Toledo hard; the local newspaper, the Toledo Blade, counts 140 factories that have closed since 2000 alone. With a population of about 300,000, Toledo is just one of many cities in the US and across the globe that flies largely under the radar. It lacks the large urbanist booster class that exists in many bigger cities. Rust Belt self-loathing remains in fashion here: a local videographer has achieved a degree of fame by posting videos to YouTube of him driving around what seems to be a mostly vacant city, with names like Only in a Dump like Toledo, or Welcome to Downtown Toledo Ohio&apos;s Fabulous Nightlife (&quot;Believe it or not, 300,000 people live here&quot;). But beyond the plant closings and the civic struggles, today Toledo is making positive global headlines for something other than shuttered malls and urban decay: for the millions of dollars in Chinese investment it is attracting.  Chinese investor groups have bought the Park Inn Hotel and Seagate Hotel downtown. Another Chinese group purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for a &quot;new urbanist&quot;-style marina, which will include a mix of residential, retail and commercial uses. Ten separate Chinese companies have established sales offices in the region. The previous mayor, Michael Bell, kicked all this off. Knowing he was unlikely to get much help from Washington in attracting investment, he decided he&apos;d go drum it up himself. He made China his city&apos;s top foreign target for investment and led several trade trips to China personally. Until recently, the Toledo/Northwest Ohio region had a full-time representative in China.     Smoke stacks at the Chrysler assembly plant in Toledo. More than 100 other factories in the area have closed down since 2000. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty    Unlikely Toledo is an example of an increasing trend around the world: small cities going it alone in search of success in a globalised, urbanised age. They are increasingly finding it necessary to act more like city-states such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Dubai, directly selling themselves to global investors and potential residents. Cities, big and small, now trade not just provincially or nationally, but globally. They&apos;re also economically specialised at both the macro level (think of fashion and luxury in Paris) and the micro (the design of super-tall skyscrapers in Chicago). Migration patterns often follow city-to-city networks. Even crime is now global.  What all this means is that each city\u2019s needs are both global and particularised \u2013 and each needs to come up with its own strategy. Large cities have led the way here: S\u00e3o Paulo is focusing on diplomacy, with an &quot;office of foreign affairs&quot; and direct relationships with the US, Britain and France, aiming to tap into global networks of money, people and expertise. In New York, the police department has created its own international anti-terrorism unit with officers stationed everywhere from London to Tel Aviv and embedded at agencies such as the FBI, New Scotland Yard and Interpol. Mayors from around the world, realising they have more in common with each other than with their countries, have formed the C40 group to tackle climate issues, as national governments continue to squabble and fail to act. But the city-state model comes with risks, especially for small cities. Too narrow a focus on global economic success can open fissures at home. In Britain, a chasm is opening between London and everywhere else. Even in the capital itself there has been a massive widening of the income gap and skyrocketing housing prices, not to mention riots.  In Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities, an ill-timed raise of transit fares just as the country was pouring billions into the Olympics triggered protests. One of those cities was S\u00e3o Paulo, the &quot;leader in foreign diplomacy&quot;, forced to come to terms with the fact that its citizens were throwing Molotov cocktails because of very local issues. Global investment might be flowing into Istanbul, but try to pave Gezi Park and watch what happens. A city too focused on its role in the global economy is like a national government obsessed with military spending.     Toledo's Maumee River. Another Chinese group has purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for redevelopment as a marina. Photograph: Alamy    It can also be taken too far, to a comical extent. Rather like Toledo, three cities in Indiana \u2013 Indianapolis, Anderson and Muncie \u2013 each took independent foreign trade trips in 2013. Yet all three are part of a single economic region, and only Indianapolis probably has the scale to operate globally.  Cooperation, here, is surely more important \u2013 as was recognised by Louisville and Lexington, two smaller cities (albeit the two largest in Kentucky) that joined forces to boost manufacturing. \u201cCities need to be excellent at partnering with each other internal to the state\u201d to compete globally, says the mayor of Louisville, Greg Fischer. Rather than city-states proper, perhaps a better way to think about these new urban areas is \u201cmetro city-states\u201d. Toledo has smartly taken this regional approach. \u201cWe always make sure to say Northwest Ohio,\u201d says Paul Zito of the area\u2019s regional growth agency.  Nevertheless, Toledo remains a deeply troubled city. The poverty rate is high and job creation anemic. So far, the hype about the China strategy probably outstrips the reality. Chinese investment has certainly put some money in the city\u2019s coffers, but it has not yet created many jobs, and the marina remains on the drawing board. Zito says that Chinese investment in Toledo is following the pattern of Japan, with commercial real estate as only \u201cthe first wave\u201d \u2013 but the new mayor, Mike Collins, says he won\u2019t make as many personal trips as his predecessor. But while full recovery for Toledo, and a potential harvest of significant jobs from its Chinese efforts, might be a way off, the fact that foreign investors are putting money into property in the urban heart of the Rust Belt shows how small cities can carve out a place for themselves on a global scale. Nick Kubiak, a Toledo expat who was living in Detroit, decided to apply the same DIY ethic happening in Motown to his own hometown. He returned last year to open a wine bar downtown, and says declining Toledo rents actually opened the door for him and others to get in where they previously couldn&apos;t before. Though he welcomes Chinese investors, Kubiak points out that many in this blue-collar union stronghold are suspicious of foreign investment. Still, as he says: &quot;You&apos;re not going to see change in Toledo without investing a lot of money \u2013 and that has to come from somewhere.&quot; And realistically, what alternative does this small city have? In a global age, cities simply have no choice but to be in the game.

The most prosaic explanation is that China&apos;s state-owned National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the rig&apos;s owner, is keen to develop sources of oil and gas for the country&apos;s energy-hungry economy that do not depend on exploration agreements with western oil companies. China regards the Paracel Islands, near the drilling site, as its sovereign territory. It takes a similar view of 90% of the 1.35m sq mile (3.5m sq km) South China Sea. The fact that nobody else agrees does not seem to bother Beijing. &quot;Large deep-water drilling rigs are our mobile national territory,&quot; said Wang Yilin, CNOOC&apos;s chairman, in 2012. At the other end of the spectrum, China&apos;s move can be seen as a direct rebuff to Barack Obama, who recently completed a four-country Asia &quot;reassurance tour&quot; designed to strengthen regional alliances as part of his administration&apos;s so-called &quot;tilt&quot; to Asia. In Tokyo, the US president warned China against forcibly pressing its maritime claims, following Beijing&apos;s unilateral declaration last autumn of an air exclusion zone over Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea. Obama offered specific security guarantees to Tokyo and stepped up US military co-operation with the Philippines, which is embroiled in similar disputes. Obama denied his intention was the &quot;containment&quot; of China. Whatever the truth, China plainly is not ready to be contained. Its response to his strictures was to send a flotilla of 80 ships to escort the oil rig. When Vietnamese vessels challenged them, they were rammed and fired upon with water cannon. China&apos;s action may alternatively be viewed as a warning to the 10-country Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean), with which it has repeatedly failed to agree a long-awaited, legally binding code of conduct on maritime disputes. China is also in effect ignoring the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. In response to Beijing&apos;s growing assertiveness, Asean member states such as Indonesia and Malaysia have been upgrading their weapons arsenals and pursuing new defensive alliances both within the bloc and with the US and Australia. &quot;South-east Asian states are working to enhance their so-called &apos;anti-access/area-denial&apos; capabilities. Vietnam [for example] has ordered six Kilo-class submarines,&quot; said an analysis by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Singapore and Thailand have also joined this mini-arms race. All the same, China&apos;s scare tactics appear to be working. Last weekend&apos;s Asean summit in Burma failed to agree on language criticising China for the final communiqu\u00e9. An earlier, separate statement called only for &quot;self-restraint&quot; in the South China Sea without mentioning China or Vietnam by name. This disarray reflects ongoing disagreements within Asean on how to handle an overbearing, militarily superior neighbour that is also their biggest trading and investment partner. The current China-Vietnam confrontation can also be seen as the by-product of a troubled past. That both countries are in effect one-party, Communist-run states, and that China supported Hanoi during the Vietnam war may give a misleading impression of their overall historical relationship. In truth, there is no love lost between the two. Vietnam was repeatedly invaded and occupied by imperial China for hundreds of years. The first Vietnamese nationalists defined their cause in relation to the threat posed by Beijing. After Vietnam&apos;s reunification in 1975, strains quickly emerged and the two countries went to war briefly in 1979. China again occupied the north while the Soviet Union backed the Vietnamese. More recently, Vietnam&apos;s lurch into Beijing-style communist-capitalism has been accompanied by deliberate attempts to mend fences with the arch-capitalists of the US. George W Bush visited in 2006, following in Bill Clinton&apos;s footsteps. Bilateral trade has grown rapidly in recent years, as has a tentative security relationship. The US remains wary of closer ties, however, maintaining that Vietnam must first improve its human rights record. The fact that John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Chuck Hagel, the defence secretary, are both Vietnam war veterans may also be a factor. This caution may be discarded if China continues to menace Vietnam and others in the region. Less than one year ago Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, signed agreements with Vietnam on trade, infrastructure and maritime security, including recommitting China to a 2011 bilateral pact to manage peaceably their differences in the South China sea. The deals were supposedly part of a charm offensive by China&apos;s new leadership to woo Asean countries. This seems forgotten now, as old enmities and present-day ambitions create new grounds for confrontation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/15/vietnam-anti-china-protests-oil-rig-dead-injured", "sentences": ["More than 600 are believed to have gone to Cambodia, while scores gathered at Ho Chi Minh airport and bought one-way tickets to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and China."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-15T19:05:21Z", "title": "At least 21 dead in Vietnam anti-China protests over oil rig", "tags": ["Vietnam", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Oil", "Commodities", "Business", "China", "Cambodia", "Malaysia", "Taiwan", "Singapore"], "article": "At least 21 people were killed and nearly 100 injured in Vietnam on Thursday during violent protests against China in one of the deadliest confrontations between the two neighbours since 1979. Crowds set fire to industrial parks and factories, hunted down Chinese workers and attacked police during the riots, which have spread from the south to the central part of the country following the start of the protests on Tuesday. The violence has been sparked by the dispute concerning China stationing an oil rig in an area of the South China Sea claimed by Vietnam. The two nations have been fighting out a maritime battle over sovereignty and that battle has now seemingly come ashore. Early Thursday morning a 1,000-strong mob stormed a giant Taiwanese steel mill in Ha Tinh province, central Vietnam, where they set buildings ablaze and chased out Chinese employees, according to a Taiwanese diplomat, Huang Chih-peng. He said both the head of the provincial government, and his security chief, were at the mill at the time of the riots, but did not &quot;order tough-enough action&quot;. Five Vietnamese workers, and 16 others described as Chinese, were killed during the rioting, a doctor at a hospital in Ha\u00a0Tinh told Reuters. An additional 90 people were injured in the attack. &quot;There were about 100 people sent to the hospital last night. Many were Chinese. More are being sent to the hospital this morning,&quot; the doctor said. The attack on the steel mill comes just two days after other mobs burned and looted scores of foreign-owned factories in south Vietnam, believing they were Chinese-run, though many were actually Taiwanese or South Korean. No deaths were reported in those initial attacks, and the Vietnamese government has since tried to crack down on protesters. More than 600 have been arrested since Tuesday. The protests have sparked an exodus of Chinese nationals, many of whom have fled to neighbouring countries or further. More than 600 are believed to have gone to Cambodia, while scores gathered at Ho Chi Minh airport and bought one-way tickets to Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and China. On Thursday, China&apos;s embassy in Vietnam urged the police to take &quot;effective measures&quot; to protect Chinese citizens&apos; safety and legal rights. China&apos;s tourism administration urged Vietnam-bound tourists to carefully consider their plans, while Taiwan&apos;s ministry of foreign affairs was printing thousands of stickers saying &quot;I am from Taiwan&quot; in Vietnamese and English and distributing them to local Taiwanese business owners, to help them avoid the wrath of anti-China mobs. Anti-Chinese sentiment, while never far below the surface in Vietnam, has hit a formidable peak since Beijing&apos;s deployment of the oil rig in disputed waters in the South China Sea on 1 May. In an attempt to assert sovereignty Vietnam quickly sent a flotilla of ships to the area; these became involved in skirmishes with 80 Chinese boats sent to protect the oil rig. China accused the Vietnamese ships of ramming its vessels after the Chinese fleet deployed water cannon against the Vietnamese. On Wednesday China reportedly sent two amphibious ships equipped with anti-air missiles as further defence. The Vietnamese government has issued stark warnings to the Chinese that this &quot;aggression&quot;, which had to date been met with Vietnamese diplomacy, would turn ugly if it continued. Vietnam would &quot;make no concession to China&apos;s wrongful acts&quot;, Major General Nguyen Quang Dam, the coast guard commander, told local media. He said: &quot;Their violent acts have posed serious threats to the lives of Vietnamese members of law enforcement.&quot; An article in the English-language daily Vietnam News was just as blunt: &quot;The Vietnamese people are angry. The nation is angry. We are telling the world that we are angry. We have every right to be angry. &quot; &quot;Over thousands of years we have shown we never cease fighting aggressors. We are proud of our freedom-fighting forefathers, and resistance is in our blood. We are a small country, but we are not weak. We will stand as one, united in the cause of protecting our motherland&apos;s integrity.&quot; China&apos;s foreign minister, Wang Yi, urged Vietnam &quot;not to attempt to further complicate and aggravate the current maritime friction&quot;, according to the state-run Global Times newspaper. The paper said that Wang told Indonesia&apos;s foreign affairs minister, Marty Natalegawa: &quot;China&apos;s position on safeguarding its legitimate sovereign rights and interests is firm and clear and will not change.&quot; . On Thursday night China&apos;s top military leader blamed the Obama administration&apos;s new focus on Asia for various disputes in the East and South China seas, saying &quot;some neighbouring countries&quot; are using it as an opportunity to provoke problems. Speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, People&apos;s Liberation Army&apos;s chief of the general staff Gen Fang Fenghui also warned that the US must be objective about tensions between China and Vietnam or risk harming relations between Washington and Beijing. He defended China&apos;s deployment of an oil rig in the South China Sea and said Beijing has no intention of abandoning the drilling despite the protests it has spawned in Vietnam. While China and Vietnam have considerable political and economic ties, anti-Chinese sentiment in Vietnam goes back more than 1,000 years to when it was a Chinese colony. The quest for sovereignty and self-rule has long been a theme, as has what Vietnam sees as China&apos;s endless provocation over maritime boundaries around the Paracel and Spratly Islands in the South China Sea \u2013 an area that about 10 countries lay full, or partial, claim to \u2013 because of its rich oil and gas reserves. The recent attacks on Vietnam&apos;s factories and industrial parks could damage the country&apos;s economy. Industrial zones, like the Ha Tinh area where the mill was set ablaze, generate a third of Vietnam&apos;s total export revenue, according to Reuters. Vietnam&apos;s prime minister, Nguyen Tan Dung, issued a message Thursday urging Vietnamese authorities to protect foreign investors. Businesses are expected to receive payouts for incurred damages. While it seems the Vietnamese and Chinese governments each want to downplay the severity of the situation \u2013 a leaked Chinese government circular obtained by the online China Digital Times urged media to &quot;not report on any news&quot; regarding the protests \u2013 the repercussions are most closely felt on the ground. &quot;People don&apos;t feel safe here,&quot; Xu Wen Hong, a Chinese national who works at one of Vietnam&apos;s iron and steel companies and bought a one-way ticket to China, told Reuters. &quot;We just want to get out of Vietnam. We&apos;re scared, of course. With all the factories burning, anyone would be scared.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/16/what-next-india-pankaj-mishra", "sentences": ["And this streamlined design for a new India immediately entices those well-off Indians who have long regarded democracy as a nuisance, recoiled from the destitute masses, and idolised technocratic, if despotic, &quot;doers&quot; like the first prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew.", "The beneficiaries of the phenomenon identified by Arundhati Roy as &quot;gush-up&quot; have soared into a transnational oligarchy, putting the bulk of their investments abroad and snapping up, together with Chinese and Russian plutocrats, real estate in London, New York and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-16T05:00:00Z", "title": "Narendra Modi and the new face of India", "tags": ["Politics", "Narendra Modi", "World news", "India", "India elections 2014", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "In A Suitable Boy, Vikram Seth writes with affection of a placid India&apos;s first general election in 1951, and the egalitarian spirit it momentarily bestowed on an electorate deeply riven by class and caste: &quot;the great washed and unwashed public, sceptical and gullible&quot;, but all &quot;endowed with universal adult suffrage&quot;. India&apos;s 16th general election this month, held against a background of economic jolts and titanic corruption scandals, and tainted by the nastiest campaign yet, announces a new turbulent phase for the country \u2013 arguably, the most sinister since its independence from British rule in 1947. Back then, it would have been inconceivable that a figure such as Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist chief minister of Gujarat accused, along with his closest aides, of\u00a0complicity in crimes ranging from an\u00a0anti-Muslim pogrom in his state in 2002 to extrajudicial killings, and barred from entering the US, may occupy India&apos;s highest political office. Modi is a lifelong member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a paramilitary Hindu nationalist organisation inspired by the fascist movements of Europe, whose founder&apos;s belief that Nazi Germany had manifested &quot;race pride at its highest&quot; by purging the Jews is by no means unexceptional among the votaries of Hindutva, or &quot;Hinduness&quot;. In 1948, a former member of the RSS murdered Gandhi for being too soft on Muslims. The outfit, traditionally dominated by upper-caste Hindus, has led many vicious assaults on minorities. A notorious executioner of dozens of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 crowed that\u00a0he had slashed open with his sword the womb of a heavily pregnant woman and extracted her foetus. Modi himself described the relief camps housing tens of thousands of displaced Muslims as &quot;child-breeding centres&quot;. Such rhetoric has helped Modi sweep one election after another in Gujarat. A\u00a0senior American diplomat described him, in cables disclosed by WikiLeaks, as an &quot;insular, distrustful person&quot; who &quot;reigns by fear and intimidation&quot;; his neo-Hindu devotees on Facebook and Twitter continue to render the air mephitic with hate and malice, populating the paranoid world of both have-nots and haves with fresh enemies \u2013 &quot;terrorists&quot;, &quot;jihadis&quot;, &quot;Pakistani agents&quot;, &quot;pseudo-secularists&quot;, &quot;sickulars&quot;, &quot;socialists&quot; and &quot;commies&quot;. Modi&apos;s own electoral strategy as prime ministerial candidate, however, has been more polished, despite his appeals, both dog-whistled and overt, to Hindu solidarity against menacing aliens and outsiders, such as the Italian-born leader of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, Bangladeshi &quot;infiltrators&quot; and those who eat the holy cow. Modi exhorts his largely young supporters \u2013 more than two-thirds of India&apos;s population is under the age of 35 \u2013 to join a revolution that will destroy the corrupt old political order and uproot its moral and ideological foundations while buttressing the essential framework, the market economy, of a glorious New India. In an apparently ungovernable country, where many revere the author of Mein Kampf for his tremendous will to power and organisation, he has shrewdly deployed the idioms of management, national security and civilisational glory. Boasting of his 56-inch chest, Modi has replaced Mahatma Gandhi, the icon of non-violence, with Vivekananda, the\u00a019th-century Hindu revivalist who was obsessed with making Indians a &quot;manly&quot; nation. Vivekananda&apos;s garlanded statue or portrait is as ubiquitous in Modi&apos;s public appearances as his dandyish pastel waistcoats. But Modi is never less convincing than when he presents himself as a humble tea-vendor, the son-of-the-soil challenger to the Congress&apos;s haughty dynasts. His\u00a0record as chief minister is predominantly distinguished by the transfer \u2013\u00a0through privatisation or outright gifts\u00a0\u2013 of national resources to the country&apos;s biggest corporations. His closest allies \u2013 India&apos;s biggest businessmen \u2013 have accordingly enlisted their mainstream media outlets into the cult of Modi as decisive administrator; dissenting journalists have been removed or silenced.     Mukesh Ambani's 27-storey house in Mumbai. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters    Not long after India&apos;s first full-scale pogrom in 2002, leading corporate bosses, ranging from the suave Ratan Tata to Mukesh Ambani, the owner of a\u00a027-storey residence, began to pave Modi&apos;s ascent to respectability and power. The stars of Bollywood fell (literally) at the feet of Modi. In recent months, liberal-minded columnists and journalists have joined their logrolling rightwing compatriots in certifying Modi as a &quot;moderate&quot; developmentalist. The Columbia University economist Jagdish Bhagwati, who insists that he intellectually fathered India&apos;s economic reforms in 1991, and Gurcharan Das, author of India Unbound, have volunteered passionate exonerations of the man they consider India&apos;s saviour. Bhagwati, once a fervent supporter of outgoing prime minister Manmohan Singh, has even publicly applied for an advisory position with Modi&apos;s government. It may be because the nearly double-digit economic growth of recent years that Ivy League economists like him \u2013 India&apos;s own version of Chile&apos;s Chicago Boys and Russia&apos;s Harvard Boys \u2013 instigated and championed turns out\u00a0to have been based primarily on extraction of natural resources, cheap labour and foreign capital inflows rather than high productivity and innovation, or indeed the brick-and-mortar ventures that fuelled China&apos;s rise as a manufacturing powerhouse. &quot;The bulk of India&apos;s aggregate growth,&quot; the World Bank&apos;s chief economist Kaushik Basu warns, &quot;is occurring through a disproportionate rise in the incomes at the upper end of the income ladder.&quot; Thus, it has left largely undisturbed the country&apos;s shameful ratios \u2013 43% of all Indian children below the age of five are undernourished, and 48% stunted; nearly half of Indian women of childbearing age are anaemic, and more than half of all Indians still defecate in the open.           Absurdly uneven and jobless economic growth has led to what Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze call &quot;islands of California in a sea of sub-Saharan Africa&quot;. The failure to generate stable employment \u2013 1m new jobs are required every month \u2013 for an increasingly urban and atomised population, or to allay the severe inequalities of opportunity as well as income, created, well before the\u00a0recent economic setbacks, a large simmering reservoir of rage and frustration. Many Indians, neglected by the state, which spends less proportionately on health and education than Malawi, and spurned by private industry, which prefers cheap contract labour, invest their hopes in notions of free enterprise and individual initiative. However, old and new hierarchies of class, caste and education restrict most of them to the ranks of the unwashed. As the Wall Street Journal admitted, India is not &quot;overflowing with Horatio Alger stories&quot;. Balram Halwai, the entrepreneur from rural India in Aravind Adiga&apos;s Man Booker-winning novel The White Tiger, who finds in murder and theft the quickest route to business success and self-confidence in the metropolis, and Mumbai&apos;s social-Darwinist slum-dwellers in Katherine Boo&apos;s Behind the Beautiful Forevers point to an intensified dialectic in India today: cruel exclusion and even more brutal self-empowerment. \u2766 Such extensive moral squalor may bewilder those who expected India to conform, however gradually and imperfectly, to a western ideal of liberal democracy and capitalism. But those scandalised by the lure of an indigenised fascism in the country billed as the &quot;world&apos;s largest democracy&quot; should know: this was not the work of a day, or of a few &quot;extremists&quot;. It has been in the making for years. &quot;Democracy in India,&quot; BR Ambedkar, the main framer of India&apos;s constitution, warned in the 1950s, &quot;is only a top dressing on an Indian soil, which is essentially undemocratic.&quot; Ambedkar saw democracy in India as a promise of justice and dignity to the country&apos;s despised and impoverished millions, which could only be realised through intense political struggle. For more than two decades that possibility has faced a pincer movement: a form of global capitalism that can only enrich a\u00a0small minority and a xenophobic nationalism that handily identifies fresh scapegoats for large-scale socio-economic failure and frustration. In many ways, Modi and his rabble \u2013 tycoons, neo-Hindu techies, and outright fanatics \u2013 are perfect mascots for the changes that have transformed India since the early 1990s: the liberalisation of the country&apos;s economy, and the destruction by Modi&apos;s compatriots of the 16th-century Babri mosque in Ayodhya. Long before the killings in Gujarat, Indian security forces enjoyed what amounted to a licence to kill, torture and rape in the border regions of Kashmir and the north-east; a similar infrastructure of repression was installed in central India after forest-dwelling tribal peoples revolted against the nexus of mining corporations and the state. The government&apos;s plan to spy on internet and phone connections makes the NSA&apos;s surveillance look highly responsible. Muslims have been imprisoned for years without trial on the flimsiest suspicion of &quot;terrorism&quot;; one of them, a Kashmiri, who had only circumstantial evidence against him, was rushed to the gallows last year, denied even the customary last meeting with his kin, in order to satisfy, as the supreme court put it, &quot;the collective conscience of the people&quot;. &quot;People who were not born then,&quot; Robert Musil wrote in The Man Without Qualities of the period before another apparently abrupt collapse of liberal values, &quot;will find it difficult to believe, but the fact is that even then time was moving faster than a cavalry camel \u2026 But in those days, no one knew what it was moving towards. Nor could anyone quite distinguish between what was above and what was below, between what was moving forward and what backward.&quot; One symptom of\u00a0this widespread confusion in Musil&apos;s novel is the Viennese elite&apos;s weird ambivalence about the crimes of a brutal murderer called Moosbrugger. Certainly, figuring out what was above and what was below is harder for the parachuting foreign journalists who alighted upon a new idea of India as an economic &quot;powerhouse&quot; and the many &quot;rising&quot; Indians in a generation born after economic liberalisation in 1991, who are seduced by Modi&apos;s promise of the utopia of consumerism \u2013 one in which skyscrapers, expressways, bullet trains and shopping malls proliferate (and from which such eyesores as the poor are excluded).     A civilising mission \u2026 Jawaharlal Nehru with Mahatma Gandhi. Photograph: Max Desfor/AP    \u2766 People who were born before 1991, and did not know what time was moving towards, might be forgiven for feeling nostalgia for the simpler days of postcolonial idealism and hopefulness \u2013 those that Seth evokes in A Suitable Boy. Set in the 1950s, the novel brims with optimism about the world&apos;s most audacious experiment in democracy, endorsing the Nehruvian &quot;idea of India&quot; that seems flexible enough to accommodate formerly untouchable Hindus (Dalits) and Muslims as well as the middle-class intelligentsia. The novel&apos;s affable anglophone characters radiate the assumption that the sectarian passions that blighted India during its partition in 1947 will be defused, secular progress through science and reason will eventually manifest itself, and an enlightened leadership will usher a near-destitute people into active citizenship and economic prosperity. India&apos;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, appears in the novel as an effective one-man buffer against Hindu chauvinism. &quot;The thought of India as a Hindu state, with its minorities treated as second-class citizens, sickened him.&quot; In Nehru&apos;s own vision, grand projects such as big dams and factories would bring India&apos;s superstitious masses out of their benighted rural habitats and propel them into first-world affluence and rationality. The Harrow- and Cambridge-educated Indian leader had inherited from British colonials at least part of their civilising mission, turning it into a national project to catch up with the industrialised west. &quot;I was eager and anxious,&quot; Nehru wrote of India, &quot;to change her outlook and appearance and give her the garb of modernity.&quot; Even the &quot;uninteresting&quot; peasant, whose &quot;limited outlook&quot; induced in him a &quot;feeling of overwhelming pity and a sense of ever-impending tragedy&quot; was to be present at what he\u00a0called India&apos;s &quot;tryst with destiny&quot;. That long attempt by India&apos;s ruling class to give the country the &quot;garb of modernity&quot; has produced, in its sixth decade, effects entirely unanticipated by Nehru or anyone else: intense politicisation and fierce contests for power together with violence, fragmentation and chaos, and a concomitant longing for authoritarian control. Modi&apos;s image as an exponent of discipline and order is built on both the successes and failures of the ancien regime. He offers top-down modernisation, but without modernity: bullet trains without the culture of criticism, managerial efficiency without the guarantee of equal rights. And this streamlined design for a new India immediately entices those well-off Indians who have long regarded democracy as a nuisance, recoiled from the destitute masses, and idolised technocratic, if despotic, &quot;doers&quot; like the first prime minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. But then the Nehruvian assumption that economic growth plotted and supervised by a wise technocracy would also bring about social change was also profoundly undemocratic and self-serving. Seth&apos;s novel, along with much anglophone literature, seems, in retrospect, to have uncritically reproduced the establishment ideology of English-speaking and overwhelmingly upper-caste Hindus who gained most from state-planned economic growth: the Indian middle class employed in the public sector, civil servants, scientists and monopolist industrialists. This ruling class&apos;s rhetoric of socialism disguised its nearly complete monopoly of power. As DR Nagaraj, one of postcolonial India&apos;s finest minds, pointed out, &quot;the institutions of capitalism, science and technology were taken over by the upper castes&quot;. Even today, businessmen, bureaucrats, scientists, writers in English, academics, thinktankers, newspaper editors, columnists and TV anchors are disproportionately drawn from among the Hindu upper-castes. And, as Sen has often lamented, their &quot;breathtakingly conservative&quot; outlook is to be blamed for the meagre investment in health and education \u2013 essential requirements for an equitable society as well as sustained economic growth \u2013 that put\u00a0India behind even disaster-prone China in human development indexes, and now makes it trail Bangladesh. Dynastic politics froze the Congress party into a network of patronage, delaying the empowerment of the underprivileged Indians who routinely gave it landslide victories. Nehru may have thought of political power as a function of moral responsibility. But his insecure daughter, Indira Gandhi, consumed by Nixon-calibre paranoia, turned politics into a game of self-aggrandisement, arresting opposition leaders and suspending fundamental rights in 1975 during a nationwide &quot;state of emergency&quot;. She supported Sikh fundamentalists in Punjab (who eventually turned against her) and rigged elections in Muslim-majority Kashmir. In the 1980s, the Congress party, facing a fragmenting voter base, cynically resorted to stoking Hindu nationalism. After Indira Gandhi&apos;s assassination by her bodyguards in 1984, Congress politicians led lynch mobs against Sikhs, killing more than 3,000 civilians. Three months later, her son Rajiv Gandhi won elections with a landslide. Then, in another eerie prefiguring of Modi&apos;s methods, Gandhi, a former pilot obsessed with computers, tried to combine technocratic rule with soft Hindutva. The Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), a political offshoot of the RSS that Nehru had successfully banished into the political wilderness, turned out to be much better at this kind of thing. In 1990, its leader LK Advani rode a &quot;chariot&quot; (actually a rigged-up Toyota flatbed truck) across India in a Hindu supremacist campaign against the mosque in Ayodhya. The wildfire of anti-Muslim violence across the country reaped immediate electoral dividends. (In old photos, Modi appears atop the chariot as Advani&apos;s hawk-eyed understudy). Another BJP chieftain ventured to hoist the Indian tricolour in insurgent Kashmir. (Again, the bearded man photographed helping his doddery senior taunt curfew-bound Kashmiris turns out to be the young Modi.) Following a few more massacres, the BJP was in power in 1998, conducting nuclear tests and fast-tracking the programme of economic liberalisation started by the Congress after a severe financial crisis in 1991. The Hindu nationalists had a ready consumer base for their blend of chauvinism and marketisation. With India&apos;s politics and economy reaching an impasse, which forced many of their relatives to emmigrate to the US, and the Congress facing decline, many powerful Indians were seeking fresh political representatives and a new self-legitimising ideology in the late 1980s and 90s. This quest was fulfilled by, first, both the post-cold war dogma of free markets and then an openly rightwing political party that was prepared to go further than the Congress in developing close relations with the US (and Israel, which, once shunned, is now India&apos;s second-biggest arms supplier after Russia). You can only marvel today at the swiftness with which the old illusions of an over-regulated economy were replaced by the fantasies of an unregulated one.     Narendra Modi waves to supporters as he rides on an open truck on his way to filing his nomination papers. Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images    According to the new wisdom \u2013 new to India, if already worn out and discredited in Latin America \u2013 all governments needed to do was get out of the way of buoyant and autonomous entrepreneurs and stop subsidising the\u00a0poor and the lazy (in a risible self-contradiction these Indian promoters of minimalist governance also clamoured for a big militarised state apparatus to fight and intimidate neighbours and stifle domestic insurgencies). The long complex experience of strong European as well as east Asian economies \u2013 active state intervention in markets and support to strategic industries, long periods of economic nationalism, investments in health and education \u2013 was elided in a new triumphalist global history of free markets. Its promise of instant and widespread affluence seemed to have been manufactured especially for gormless journalists and columnists. Still, in the last decade, neoliberalism became the common sense of many Indians who were merely aspiring as well as those who had already made it \u2013 the only elite ideology after Nehruvian nation-building to have achieved a high degree of pan-Indian consent, if not total hegemony. The old official rhetoric of egalitarian and shared futures gave way to the media&apos;s celebrations of private wealth-creation \u2013 embodied today by Ambani&apos;s 27-storey private residence in a city where a majority lives in slums \u2013 and a proliferation of Ayn Randian cliches about ambition, willpower and striving. \u2766 Nehru&apos;s programme of national self-strengthening had included, along with such ideals as secularism, socialism and non-alignment, a deep-rooted suspicion of American foreign policy and economic doctrines. In a stunning coup, India&apos;s postcolonial project was taken over, as Octavio Paz once wrote of the Mexican revolution, &quot;by a capitalist class made in the image and\u00a0likeness of US capitalism and dependent upon it&quot;. A new book by Anita Raghavan, The Billionaire&apos;s Apprentice: The Rise of the Indian-American Elite and the Fall of the Galleon Hedge Fund, reveals how well-placed men such as Rajat Gupta, the investment banker recently convicted for insider trading in New York, expedited close links between American and Indian political and business leaders. India&apos;s upper-caste elite transcended party lines in their impassioned courting of likely American partners. In 2008, an American diplomat in Delhi was given an exclusive preview by a Congress party factotum of two chests containing $25m in cash \u2013 money to bribe members of parliament into voting for a nuclear deal with the US. Visiting the White House later that year, Singh blurted out to George W Bush, probably resigned by then to being the most despised American president in history, that &quot;the people of India love you deeply&quot;. In a conversation disclosed by WikiLeaks, Arun Jaitley, a senior leader of the BJP who is tipped to be finance minister in Modi&apos;s government, urged American diplomats in Delhi to see his party&apos;s anti-Muslim rhetoric as &quot;opportunistic&quot;, a mere &quot;talking point&quot; and to take more seriously his own professional and emotional links with the US. A transnational elite of rightwing Indians based in the US helped circulate an impression of an irresistibly &quot;emerging giant&quot; \u2013 the title of a book by Arvind Panagariya, a New-York-based economist and another aspiring adviser to Modi. Very quickly, the delusional notion that India was, as Foreign Affairs proclaimed on its cover in 2006, a &quot;roaring capitalist success-story&quot; assumed an extraordinary persuasive power. In India itself, a handful of corporate acquisitions \u2013 such as Tata&apos;s of Jaguar and Corus \u2013 stoked exorbitant fantasies of an imminent &quot;Global Indian Takeover&quot; (the title of a regular feature once in India&apos;s leading business daily, the Economic Times). Rent-seekers in a shadow intellectual economy \u2013 thinktank-sailors, bloggers and\u00a0Twitterbots \u2013 as well as academics perched on corporate-endowed chairs recited the mantra of privatisation and deregulation in tune. Nostrums from the Reagan-Thatcher era \u2013 the primary source of ideological self-indoctrination for many Americanised Indians \u2013 about &quot;labour flexibility&quot; were endlessly regurgitated, even though a vast majority of the workforce in India \u2013 more than 90% \u2013 toils in the unorganised or &quot;informal&quot; sector. Bhagwati, for\u00a0instance, hailed Bangladesh for its superb labour relations a few months before the collapse of the Rana Plaza in Dhaka; he also speculated that the poor &quot;celebrate&quot; inequality, and, with Marie Antoinette-ish serenity, advised malnourished families to consume &quot;more milk and fruits&quot;. Confronted with the World Health Organisation&apos;s extensive evidence about malnutrition in India, Panagariya, ardent patron of the emerging giant, argued that Indian children are genetically underweight. \u2766            This pitiless American free-marketeering wasn&apos;t the only extraordinary mutation of Indian political and economic discourse. By 1993, when A Suitable Boy was published, the single-party democracy it describes had long been under siege from low-caste groups and a rising Hindu-nationalist middle class. (Sunil Khilnani&apos;s The Idea of India, the most eloquent defence and elaboration of India&apos;s foundational ideology, now seems another posthumous tribute to it.) India after Indira Gandhi increasingly failed to respect the Nehruvian elite&apos;s coordinates of progress and order. Indian democracy, it turned out, had seemed stable only because political participation was severely limited, and upper-caste Hindus effectively ran the country. The\u00a0arrival of low-caste Hindus in mass\u00a0politics in the 1980s, with their representatives demanding their own share of the spoils of power, put the first strains on the old patrimonial system. Upper-caste panic initially helped swell the ranks of the BJP, but even greater shifts caused by accelerating economic growth after 1991 have fragmented even relatively recent political formations based on caste and religion. Rapid urbanisation and decline of agriculture created a large mass of the working poor exposed to ruthless exploitation in the unorganised sector. Connected to their homes in the hinterland through the flow of remittances, investment, culture and ideas, these migrants from rural areas were steadily politically awakened with the help of print literacy, electronic media, job mobility and, most importantly, mobile phones (subscribers grew\u00a0from 45 million in 2002 to almost a billion in 2012). The Congress, though instrumentally social-welfarist while in\u00a0power, failed to respond to this electorally consequential blurring of rural and urban borderlines, and the heightened desires for recognition and dignity as well as for rapid inclusion into global modernity. Even the BJP, which had fed on upper-caste paranoia, had been struggling under its ageing leaders to respond to an increasingly demanding mass of voters after its initial success in the 1990s, until Modi reinvented himself as a messiah of development, and quickly found enlarged constituencies \u2013 among haves\u00a0as well as have-nots \u2013 for his blend of xenophobia and populism. A wave of political disaffection has\u00a0also deposited democratic social movements and dedicated individuals across the country. Groups both within and outside the government, such as those that successfully lobbied for the groundbreaking Right to Information Act, are outlining the possibilities of what John Keane calls &quot;monitory democracy&quot;. India&apos;s many activist networks \u2013 for the rights of women, Dalits, peasants and indigenous communities \u2013 or issue-based campaigns, such as those against big dams and nuclear power plants, steer clear of\u00a0timeworn ideas of national security, economic development, technocratic management, whether articulated by the Nehruvians or the neo-Hindus. In a\u00a0major environment referendum last year, residents of small tribal hamlets in a remote part of eastern India voted to reject bauxite mining in their habitats. Growing demands across India for autonomy and bottom-up governance confirm that Modi is merely offering old \u2013 and soured \u2013 lassi in new bottles with his version of top-down modernisation. Modi, however, has opportunely timed his attempt to occupy the commanding heights of the Indian state vacated by the Congress. The structural problems of India&apos;s globalised economy have dramatically slowed its growth since 2011, terminating the euphoria over the Global Indian Takeover. Corruption scandals involving the sale of billions of dollars&apos; worth of national resources such as mines, forests, land, water and telecom spectrums have revealed that crony capitalism and rent-seeking were the real engines of India&apos;s economy. The beneficiaries of the phenomenon identified by Arundhati Roy as &quot;gush-up&quot; have soared into a transnational oligarchy, putting the bulk of their investments abroad and snapping up, together with Chinese and Russian plutocrats, real estate in London, New York and Singapore. Meanwhile, those made to wait unconscionably long for &quot;trickle-down&quot; \u2013 people with dramatically raised but mostly unfulfillable aspirations \u2013 have become vulnerable to demagogues promising national regeneration. It is this tiger of unfocused fury, spawned by global capitalism in the &quot;underdeveloped&quot; world, that Modi has sought to ride from Gujarat to New Delhi. \u2766 &quot;Even in the darkest of times,&quot; Hannah Arendt once wrote, &quot;we have the right to expect some illumination.&quot; The most prominent Indian institutions and individuals have rarely obliged, even as the darkness of the country&apos;s atrocity-rich borderlands moved into the heartland. Some of the most respected commentators, who are often eloquent in their defence of the right to free speech of famous writers, maintained a careful silence about the government&apos;s routine strangling of the internet and mobile networks in Kashmir. Even the liberal newspaper the Hindu prominently featured a journalist who retailed, as an investigation in Caravan revealed, false accusations of terrorism against innocent citizens. (The virtues of intelligence, courage and integrity are manifested more commonly in small periodicals such as Caravan and Economic and Political Weekly, or independent websites such as Kafila.org and Scroll.in.) The owners of the country&apos;s largest English-language newspaper, the Times of India, which has lurched from tedium to decadence within a few years, have innovated a revenue-stream called &quot;paid news&quot;. Unctuously lobbing softballs at Modi, the prophets of electronic media seem, on other occasions, to have copied their paranoid inquisitorial style from Glenn Beck and\u00a0Rush Limbaugh. Santosh Desai, one of contemporary India&apos;s most astute observers, correctly points out that the &quot;intolerance that one sees from a large section of society is in\u00a0some way a product of a &apos;televisionised&apos; India. The pent-up feelings of resentment and entitlement have rushed out and get both tacit and explicit support from television.&quot; A spate of corporate-sponsored literary festivals did not compensate for the missing culture of debate and reflection in the press. The frothy glamour of these events may have helped obscure the deeper intellectual and cultural churning in India today, the emergence of writers and artists from unconventional class and caste backgrounds, and the renewed attention to BR Ambedkar, the bracing Dalit thinker obscured by upper-caste iconographies. The probing work of, among others, such documentary film-makers as Anand Patwardhan (Jai Bhim Comrade), Rahul Roy (Till We Meet Again), Rakesh Sharma (Final Solution) and Sanjay Kak (Red-Ant Dream), and members of the Raqs Media Collective outlines a modernist counterculture in the making. But the case of Bollywood shows how the unravelling of the earliest nation-building project can do away with the stories and images through which many people imagined themselves to be part of a larger whole, and leave only tawdriness in its place. Popular Hindi cinema degenerated alarmingly in the 1980s. Slicker now, and craftily aware of its non-resident Indian audience, it has become an expression of consumer nationalism and middle-class self-regard; Amitabh Bachchan, the &quot;angry young man&quot; who enunciated a widely felt victimhood during a high point of corruption and inflation in the\u00a01970s, metamorphosed into an avuncular endorser of luxury brands. A\u00a0search for authenticity, and linguistic vivacity, has led film-makers back to the rural hinterland in such films as Gangs of Wasseypur, Peepli Live and Ishqiya, whose flaws are somewhat redeemed by their scrupulous avoidance of Indians sporting Herm\u00e8s bags or driving Ferraris. Some recent breakthroughs such as Anand Gandhi&apos;s Ship of Theseus and Dibakar Banerji&apos;s Costa-Gavras-inspired Shanghai gesture to the cinema of crisis pioneered by Asian, African and Latin American film-makers. But India&apos;s many film industries have yet to produce anything that matches Jia Zhangke&apos;s unsentimental evocations of China&apos;s past and present, the acute examination of middle-class pathologies in Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho&apos;s Neighbouring Sounds, or Nuri Bilge Ceylan&apos;s delicate portrait of the sterile secularist intellectual in Uzak. \u2766 The long artistic drought results partly from the confusion and bewilderment of an older, entrenched elite, the main producers, until recently, of mainstream culture. With their prerogative to rule and interpret India pilfered by the &quot;unwashed&quot; and the &quot;gullible&quot;, the anglophones have been struggling to grasp the eruption of mass politics in India, its new centrifugal thrust, and the nature of the challenge posed by many apparently illiberal individuals and movements. It is easy for them to denounce India&apos;s evidently uncouth retailers of caste and religious identity as embodiments of, in Salman Rushdie&apos;s words, &quot;Caligulan barbarity&quot;; or to mock Chetan Bhagat, the bestselling author of novels for young adults and champion tweeter, for boasting of his &quot;selfie&quot; with Modi. Those pied-pipering the young into Modi-mania nevertheless possess the occult power to fulfil the deeper needs of their needy followers. They can compile vivid ideological collages \u2013 made of fragments of modernity, glimpses of\u00a0utopia and renovated pieces of a forgotten past. It is in the &quot;mythological thrillers&quot; and positive-thinking fictions \u2013 the most popular literary genres in India today \u2013 that a post-1991 generation that doesn&apos;t even know it is lost fleetingly but thrillingly recognises itself. In a conventional liberal perspective, these works may seem like hotchpotches, full of absurd contradictions that confound the &quot;above&quot; with the &quot;below&quot;, the &quot;forward&quot; with the &quot;backward&quot;. Modi, for instance, consistently mixes up dates and historical events, exposing an abysmal ignorance of the past of the country he hopes to lead into a glorious future. Yet his lusty hatred of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty excites many young Indians weaned on the neo-liberal opiates about aspiration and merit. And he combines his historical revisionism and Hindu nationalism with a revolutionary futurism. He knows that resonant sentiments, images, and symbols \u2013 Vivekananda plus holograms and Modi masks \u2013 rather than rational argument or accurate history galvanise individuals. Vigorously aestheticising mass politics, and mesmerising the restless young, he has emerged as the new India&apos;s canniest artist. But, as Walter Benjamin pointed out, rallies, parades and grand monuments do not secure the masses their rights; they give them no more than the chance to express themselves, and noisily identify with an alluring leader and his party. It seems predictable that Modi will gratify only a few with his ambitious rescheduling of India&apos;s tryst with destiny. Though many exasperated Indians see Modi as bearing the long-awaited fruits of the globalised economy, he actually embodies its inevitable dysfunction. He resembles the European and Japanese demagogues of the\u00a0early 20th century who responded to the many crises of liberalism and democracy \u2013 and of thwarted nation-building and modernisation \u2013 by merging corporate and political power, and exhorting communal unity before internal and external threats. But Modi belongs also to the dark days of the early 21st century. His ostensibly gratuitous assault on\u00a0Muslims \u2013 already India&apos;s most depressed and demoralised minority \u2013 was another example of what the social anthropologist Arjun Appadurai calls &quot;a vast worldwide Malthusian correction, which works through the idioms of minoritisation and ethnicisation but is\u00a0functionally geared to preparing the world for the winners of globalisation, minus the inconvenient noise of its losers&quot;. Certainly, the new horizons of\u00a0desire and fear opened up by global capitalism do not favour democracy or human rights. Other strongmen who supervised the bloody purges of economically enervated and unproductive people were also ruthless majoritarians, consecrated by big election victories. The crony-capitalist regimes of Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand and Vladimir Putin in Russia were inaugurated by ferocious offensives against ethnic minorities. The electorally bountiful pogrom in Gujarat in 2002, too, now seems an early initiation ritual for Modi&apos;s India. The difficulty of assessing his personal culpability in the killings and rapes of 2002 is the same difficulty that Musil identifies with Moosbrugger in his novel: how to measure the crimes, however immense, of individuals against a universal breakdown of values and the normalisation of violence and injustice. &quot;If mankind could dream collectively,&quot; Musil writes, &quot;it would dream Moosbrugger.&quot; There is little cause yet for such despair in India, where the aggrieved fantasy of authoritarianism will have to reckon with the gathering energies below; the great potential of the country&apos;s underprivileged and voiceless peoples still lies untapped. But\u00a0for now some Indians have dreamed collectively, and\u00a0they have dreamed a man accused of mass murder."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/18/-sp-truth-about-gentrification-how-woodberry-down-became-woodberry-park", "sentences": ["Although sceptical about the investment value of paying nearly \u00a3400,000 for a two-bed flat in what remains a deprived patch of inner London, he\u2019s scouting out the development for a client in Singapore.", "We\u2019ve had families from Singapore who take a unit here to rent out, but really keep it to send their children when they\u2019re old enough to go to the LSE [London School of Economics] or wherever.\u201d When marketing began, Berkeley concentrated its efforts on east Asia and ended up selling around 55% of the first phase of buildings to overseas investors.", "The firm has sales offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and, as of last autumn, Beijing.", "But if I\u2019m honest, the reality is I\u2019ll end up moving miles out of London, paying exorbitant train fares, desperately scrambling to find a nice school for the kids.\u201dPaul leases his flat from a Singaporean investor who he\u2019s never met: \u201cAll of my neighbours rent from foreign absentee landlords.&quot; This fits the picture drawn in the property pages of the British press, which often depict would-be London housebuyers as battling an army of invisible competitors: Russian oligarchs, Saudi sheikhs and, at the other end of the market, anxious Greek professionals and Asian nuclear families.", "Yet the forces that have driven Singaporeans over here are rarely spelt out.", "No shame there: about 85% of all Singaporeans live in Housing and Development Board quarters, or HDBs for short.", "The big difference is that since 2009, Singapore\u2019s government has chucked bucket after bucket of cold water onto the overheating housing market.", "The message is simple: Singapore doesn\u2019t welcome property speculation."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-18T15:00:00Z", "title": "The truth about gentrification: regeneration or con trick?", "tags": ["Regeneration", "Housing", "Communities", "Hackney", "London", "UK news", "Social exclusion", "Society", "Cities"], "article": "Google Tony Pidgley, chairman of one of Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders, and you\u2019ll find a video in which he shows off his latest toy. The plaything in question is a giant council estate that his firm, Berkeley Homes, is smashing up and building over. A squat, punchy figure, he shows a reporter around the new towers \u2013 and the gashed old blocks that, we\u2019re informed, were used in Schindler\u2019s List as a stand-in for the Warsaw Ghetto. \u201cYou can understand why they used it in the film,\u201d begins Pidgley in a reasonable tone. \u201cIt looks like a concentration camp.\u201d Forget for a moment that the Warsaw Ghetto was not a concentration camp, or that practically every large inner-London estate has featured in some film in the role of Ominous Backdrop. Ignore the crassness of a man who, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, is worth \u00a3160m casually rubbishing the homes of thousands of families poorer than him. Concentrate instead on the rare sight presented in that clip: a businessman at the height of his powers. Pidgley is one of the most lavishly paid executives in his industry. The firm he helms is enjoying bumper profits, thanks to a taxpayer-funded housing boom in Berkeley\u2019s key market of London and the south-east. And the building site where he\u2019s playing the tour guide \u2013 Woodberry Down in Manor House, north-east London \u2013 is one of the largest housing-estate redevelopments in Britain. By 2031, around 2,000 council or former council homes will have been demolished and replaced with more than 5,500 units on the estate: some social housing; some for \u201ckey workers\u201d, the euphemism now used for low-paid public servants, and the majority to be sold on the open market. The flagship private block in Woodberry Down, looking on to a lovely reservoir, has been sold largely to foreign investors, with one flat going for a million pounds (tell a Londoner that flats in Manor House are going for a million quid and see how low their jaw drops).     Woodberry Park, the new development taking the place of the Woodberry Down council estate in Hackney, east London. Photograph: Alamy    Pidgley began touting Woodberry Down as a \u201cblueprint for regeneration and all the new development Britain needs to beat the housing crisis\u201d in February. Although it has only just got going on a job that will last 25 years, Berkeley Homes published a scientific-looking survey that neatly showed residents to be delighted with the results so far. At a corporate meeting this February to publicise the poll, coalition planning minister Nick Boles gave a warm keynote speech and the Times led the media applause: \u201cSchindler\u2019s estate is now a blueprint for urban happiness\u201d. Within the grasp of Pidgley\u2019s team is a tantalisingly large prize. If Berkeley can establish itself as the pre-eminent name in regeneration, it will put itself front of the queue for what is a roaring business. It will also have even greater sway with local authorities, London city hall and Westminster. Executives at the FTSE-250 company estimate that, of every four houses they build, one is on a former council estate somewhere in the capital. But the potential business is much larger: 1.69 million people in England were waiting for local authority accommodation last year; over 344,000 in London alone. Unprecedented cuts have left town halls up and down the country less cash to maintain their existing housing stock \u2013 giving them little choice but to turn to Pidgely and co. These public-private partnerships are relatively recent and haven\u2019t come under much serious scrutiny, either in the press or in parliament. Yet they are widespread. The Guardian asked London\u2019s local authorities about their schemes to redevelop public housing with a private builder, in which at least some of the dwellings would be sold on the open market. Our map shows the results: of the capital\u2019s 32 councils, 18 are in such partnerships with the private sector, many across multiple estates. As the financial crisis recedes into the middle distance, London has been colonised by builders\u2019 hoardings and cement mixers. Hospitals are being transformed into luxury flats; school fields littered with concrete boxes, and public housing turned into not-so-public housing. With politicians of all stripes looking for ways to drum up millions of new homes, Berkeley and its rivals will become ever more important to Britain\u2019s future. By the time Pidgley began his Woodberry Down PR push, we had spent many hours talking to its residents. Our interest was aroused by the claims being made for it: Hackney council officials described it privately as its \u201cgreatest success\u201d; the commitment to making 40% of the new development affordable homes. To critics, regeneration is simply code for gentrification, which is often a fancy term to describe how poor people are cleared from valuable land to make way for the rich. But here was a scheme promising regeneration with a conscience, creating a genuinely mixed community. Council and the builders sang the same song: Woodberry Down represented private-led redevelopment at its best \u2013 a model to be followed. Except the residents on the estate consistently demonstrated that the claims about its transformation were untrue. Berkeley\u2019s survey \u2013 the subject of laudatory column inches \u2013 turned out to be about as methodologically robust as the science part of a L\u2019Oreal advert: it was massively skewed towards those settling into the new towers, when the vast majority still live in the old blocks, and will do for years. And it omitted entirely the number of residents who were moved off the estate.Among the more than 50 interviewees we spoke to over six months, there was naturally a range of views about what benefits had been brought by regeneration. But the majority talked of pensioners offered inadequate sums for their leaseholdings, and being forced to move far from their families; of business owners promised a place in the new development only to be turfed out later, losing small fortunes in the process. Their neighbourhood was an endangered species: a patch of inner London belonging to the elderly, the working poor, the unemployed. Now it was being broken up to suit an international company selling homes to the well-off. The fact their council was leading this dismemberment made some especially angry. Even tenants in the new social housing reported how they or neighbours had been plunged into debt because of the higher bills incurred through having a private housing association as a landlord. Despite Berkeley\u2019s promise to \u201cbring together all people in Woodberry Down\u201d, social tenants reported that those living in the expensive private blocks \u201ccross the road to avoid us\u201d. They had been made to feel like second-class citizens in their own home. What follows are stories of the people best placed to tell you about what regeneration does to a community: the ones who come from it. Some have lived on Woodberry Down for more than six decades; others are in their 20s. Their photos don\u2019t feature in the civic-centre case studies or corporate press releases. They haven\u2019t got local elections to win, or a profit target to chase. They\u2019ve just got to live with the results. Jane              In all her 65 years on Woodberry Down, Jane Frost has never had to deal with anything like this. Around six or seven on most evenings, a mystery man comes to her flat and pees against the balcony outside. Jane\u2019s the only resident left on the entire floor; and there\u2019s no neighbor, no security guard to pop out and see who the pest is. The 71-year-old cleans up the puddles herself. All five storeys of Jane\u2019s council block have been emptied. Almost everyone else has been rehoused, either in the new blocks opposite or in a different area. But Jane is disabled and, even after years, the council has yet to find her suitable accommodation. Which leaves her stuck here, with so few neighbours that she finds it \u201ccreepy\u201d. Too creepy for her friends, who don\u2019t visit after dark for fear of muggers \u2013 or worse. \u201cWhen I come up the stairs late at night my heart\u2019s going boom-boom-boom-boom,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I\u2019m taken bad I no longer have anyone\u2019s door I can knock on.\u201d The afternoon light streams into Jane\u2019s lounge, playing on a lifetime\u2019s worth of ornaments and porcelain. But outside her front door, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely horrible. I\u2019m a nervous wreck.\u201d Since the regeneration began she\u2019s been diagnosed with depression. One night she went out for a loaf, got chatting to a woman selling the Big Issue and let slip where she lived. The homeless woman was so worried for Jane\u2019s safety that she walked her home \u2013 and wouldn\u2019t even take anything for the trouble. Out on the pensioner\u2019s deserted balcony you see the thing she blames most for leaving her \u201cabandoned\u201d. It\u2019s the towers springing up opposite, and the changes they\u2019ve ushered in. All that activity on the other side of the road \u2013 the cranes, the 400-plus builders charging around in white hard hats \u2013 could be described as rejuvenation: bringing new life to decades-old dereliction. \u201cA Place in the Making,\u201d Berkeley Homes calls it. They\u2019ve slapped the phrase on hoardings everywhere, and rechristened the area Woodberry Park.Visitors to the 64-acre estate now have two maps to navigate. On one is the old council layout of Woodberry Down, each block assigned a starchily municipal name: Bayhurst, Delamere, Whittlebury. On the other is a Technicolor guide to Woodberry Park and its landmarks: Residence, Watersreach and, less dreamily, Berkeley Homes Marketing Suite. Yet marketing won\u2019t totally obliterate history as long as people such as Jane and her childhood friend Sheila Coxon are knocking around. They met on this estate in 1949, the year after it opened. \u201cYou\u2019d have parties in the courtyards,\u201d remembers Jane. Sheila chimes in: \u201cYou had a community.\u201d You also had heroic public investment. Woodberry Down was the brainchild of Peter Mandelson\u2019s grandfather, Labour MP Herbert Morrison, who wanted to rehouse working-class Londoners living in inner-city squalor \u2013 even if it meant compulsorily buying up the homes of the well-to-do residents of Manor House. \u201cMorrison drives out mansion owners,\u201d thundered the North London Recorder in November 1938 under the headline: \u201c\u00a31,000,000 slum dwellers\u2019 paradise\u201d. It ran a photo of a resident standing pensively by the reservoir and warned, \u201cHundreds of shouting children will take the place of this solitary silent man.\u201d But soon \u201ceverybody wanted to be here,\u201d says Jane. She tells a family legend about how her mum lobbied the then-MP for Westminster Abbey: \u201cHe said: \u2018What do you want? A flat in Westminster?\u2019 And she said: \u2018No \u2026 on the Woodberry Down estate.\u2019 He told her she was asking the world, the absolute world. That\u2019s how good this estate was.\u201d Council housing is now synonymous with cheap boxes, built grudgingly, and piled up to the sky. But, however rundown, the low-rise redbrick blocks of Woodberry Down still look solid \u2013 reminders of their prideful days as an \u201cestate of the future\u201d, toured by policy-makers in order to glean lessons. With a health centre opening in 1952 and Britain\u2019s first purpose-built comprehensive soon afterwards, it was also a showcase for the cradle-to-grave welfare state. \u201cThe estate was the estate and everybody had it the same,\u201d says Sheila. Then she nods towards the building works: \u201cIt\u2019s segregation, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She\u2019s referring to the way the different classes of resident live in different blocks: social tenants on subsidised rent in one, part-owners of \u201caffordable\u201d homes in another, and the private residents in their own flagship tower. \u201cThe private properties are being built around the reservoir, with just a few token flats for council residents. The private buyers have got the best part of the estate.\u201d Gentrification  The term \u201cgentrification\u201d was coined just down the road from Woodberry Down, about 15 years after Jane and Sheila moved into their new homes. Living in Islington, north London, sociologist Ruth Glass noticed a rapid change among her neighbours. \u201cOne by one, many of the working-class quarters of London have been invaded by the middle classes \u2013 upper and lower,\u201d she wrote in an article published in 1964. \u201cShabby, modest mews and cottages \u2026 have been taken over, when their leases have expired, and have become elegant, expensive residences \u2026 Once this process of \u2018gentrification\u2019 starts \u2026 it goes on rapidly until \u2026 the original working-class occupiers are displaced, and the social character of the district is changed.\u201d This is gentrification as we still discuss it: the invisible hand of the market moving inexorably but gently (it waits until the leases expire) to gentrify an area. The squatters beget artists, who beget the public-sector middle-class, who beget banker families, who just stay put in their stucco-fronted Georgian houses, endlessly decorating and redecorating. A doleful bugle sounds for the demise of the family-run cobbler, soon drowned out by buzz over the gelato parlour that\u2019s replaced it. This long, slow process of gentrification does not describe what\u2019s happening in Woodberry Down, or on mammoth estates from Greenwich\u2019s Ferrier (which, in Berkeley\u2019s hands, is being remoulded into Kidbrooke Village) to the Heygate in Elephant and Castle. Many of the made-up \u201cvillages\u201d and \u201cparks\u201d mushrooming across the capital owe nothing to age-old market forces and everything to councils eager to upgrade their housing stock without eating into already-stretched budgets. They pass control of their inventory to a private housing association (Genesis, in the case of Woodberry Down) and lease the land for a few centuries to big developers. The builders put up new \u201caffordable\u201d homes to be sold or rented at below market rates, and cross-subsidise them by constructing expensive private homes. This planned poshification has been given a name by Paul Watt at London\u2019s Birkbeck: state-led gentrification.     Woodberry Down estate in Manor House, London. Photograph: Martin Godwin    This is the unwinding of the process that created Woodberry Down. Herbert Morrison built municipal housing to shield Londoners from a broken market; his successors in local government are exposing their constituents to market forces in a manner not seen in postwar Britain. In 1981, 57.5% of homes in Hackney were rented from the council; by the last census in 2011, that had more than halved to 23.8%. Over that same period, the proportion of homes in the borough rented privately leapt from 17.8% to 29%. The same trend applies across inner London. By Watt\u2019s rule of thumb, if a London tenant pays weekly rent of \u00a3100 to the council, their counterpart in the private sector will typically give \u00a3400 to a landlord or landlady. And they will have much less protection. Maxwell              \u201cIt makes me want to cry, to be honest,\u201d says Maxwell O\u2019Hajah, thumbing through Berkeley Homes\u2019 sales brochure for Woodberry Park. His cracked white fingertips are a tell-tale sign of 20 years in construction. \u201cI\u2019m looking through this and all the amenities that we had already, they\u2019re bragging about. The reservoir, the sailing club, the parks, the local markets: they\u2019ve always been there. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re actually adding.\u201d Now 46, Maxwell moved to Woodberry Down in his teens. He joined the residents\u2019 regeneration committee after finding out his flat would be one of the first to be demolished. At that point, early last decade, he became an eyewitness to the state-led gentrification of Woodberry Down. When putting the development out to tender, Hackney council created footage to show developers. \u201cThey made it look like a hell hole. They played the theme music from a horror film and made Woodberry Down out to be some kind of project in America.\u201d Experts note that this is a common tactic used by local councils: running down the existing area to whip up support among tenants for a private-led regeneration. As a tenant rep, Maxwell saw Berkeley Homes present its bid for the project. \u201cThere were a few residents, a few people from the council, and 11 of them. They felt really heavy handed. Every single one was in a blue suit. Every single one had a tie on. They were all men.\u201d Then began negotiations with tenants. \u201cResidents were like: \u2018A sports centre \u2013 that would be nice \u2026 Ooh, and a swimming pool, yeah.\u2019 They were asking for things like kids in a sweet shop. They thought this regeneration was for them. But Berkeley Homes are hard-nosed business people. We were never going to get our way.\u201d The gym on the estate is only for those in the private block; the same will go for the swimming pool featured on builders\u2019 hoardings. When Maxwell realised how much his living costs would increase in the new flats, with a housing association as landlord rather than the council, he moved off Woodberry Down. \u201cI\u2019m glad. This is a regeneration if you\u2019re coming from the outside. If you\u2019re already on the inside it\u2019s just destruction. It\u2019s blatantly obvious that they don\u2019t want us to live there any more. It\u2019s just ghettoisation \u2013 that\u2019s what this model of regeneration is.\u201d Gina     Woodberry Down estate, now a regeneration project. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Gina O\u2019Raegan can give you a tour of what\u2019s wrong with where she lives. Tugging along her staffie, Shumba, the itinerary is a litany of horrors: the corner flat with such bad subsidence that it\u2019s now uninhabitable; the courtyard where dealers were hanging out last summer, since they could no longer ply drugs over by the new-builds, and the boarded-up properties whose residents have left. She lives up the road from Jane, in what locals call the Seven Blocks (although she\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t use that nickname: \u201cIt sounds like a prison\u201d). These are the most dilapidated buildings on the estate, so bad that Gina never lets on to workmates or acquaintances her address in case they work out where she lives. Her home makes her ashamed. Gina and her 20-year-old son James live in \u201climbo\u201d, in the gulf between regeneration-speak and practice. In 2006, the council laid out key principles for which parts of the estate would be replaced first. Top of the list was: \u201cReplacing the worst first\u201d. Residents were led to understand that this meant those living in the Seven Blocks would be first into the new flats, and their old buildings demolished. Then plans changed. All of a sudden, the most marketable land around the reservoir was first in line for new flats. Other residents say they\u2019ve heard Berkeley executives admit in meetings: \u201cThere\u2019s no revenue in knocking them [the Seven Blocks] down.\u201d Now Gina and James will have to wait until at least 2020, possibly 2021, to move. \u201cWe don\u2019t look over the reservoir so we\u2019re being punished. Simple as.\u201d Inside her flat, long, wide cracks snake across the ceiling. The old metal toilet cistern drips water, but the council won\u2019t replace it \u2013 because that counts as a major repair, unnecessary on a estate due for rebuilding. \u201cI\u2019ve got to live with this dripping on me for the next seven years.\u201d Her bedroom has splotches of brilliant white paint, to cover up the mould. \u201cI\u2019ve had black mould on my bedding.\u201d She keeps clothes in plastic laundry bags for protection. The curtains are rotten with damp from condensation: \u201cThey rip like paper.\u201d Council officials say the blocks were not so long ago fitted with double-glazing; residents say that that has made the condensation worse. On Gina\u2019s bedside table is a damp trap, which after a month has collected over two inches of water. She has had a chest infection for the past couple of years: whatever the doctor tries doesn\u2019t shift it. Among all this wreckage, the usual domestic touches \u2013 children\u2019s photos, embroidered cushions reading Stay Calm and Smile \u2013 seem forced. A Hackney surveyor came round last year to look at the mould. On being told that Gina paid her full rent and deserved a proper service, he replied, \u201cSome people may argue that you pay subsidised rent because you live in a council property\u201d (Hackney acknowledges such language is \u201cunacceptable\u201d). \u201cThey think: \u201cYou\u2019re poor, be grateful.\u201d Like many others here, Gina chafes against the stereotypes hung round her neck by others. She wants you to know that she works two jobs and \u201cisn\u2019t on Benefits Street\u201d. Jane stresses that before becoming a pensioner, she never took any welfare. One Turkish shopkeeper introduces himself with: \u201cI\u2019m not a refugee \u2013 I work and pay tax.\u201d Gina looks around the flat where she and James have their stress-fuelled arguments; where her 20-year-old hates bringing a girlfriend home. \u201cThis regeneration isn\u2019t about decent homes,\u201d she says. \u201cIf it was about decent homes then I wouldn\u2019t be living here. Yes or no?\u201d The town hall You won\u2019t find in Woodberry Down the usual stories of epic bungling and back-scratching that mark so many land deals between town halls and big developers. There aren\u2019t any tales of a council spending so much on evicting its own residents to make way for developers that they lose millions on the entire deal (as is reportedly the case with Southwark council and the Heygate). Or of officials flogging public land to big companies and not even getting any affordable homes in return (as Haringey council has done with the new \u00a3400m Spurs development. As Hackney officials like to boast, they have armwrestled a good deal out of their builders. Just over 40% of the new estate will be affordable homes. Not only that, tenants will be moved (\u201cdecanted\u201d in regeneration-speak) only once, and the flats they move into will be guaranteed a certain size. Put all that together with the state Woodberry Down had reached by the 90s \u2013 and if private-led renewal is going to work anywhere, it\u2019s here. But stripping away the usual gaffes shows up the underlying problems of the model. Take the most basic step, the tendering of a building contract, which Maxwell witnessed. Hackney councillor Karen Alcock acknowledges that there aren\u2019t many developers qualified to take on a project such as Woodberry Down. And developers demand fat returns for doing such work. The usual profit target is 21%, says Duncan Bowie, a former member of the Mayor of London\u2019s planning team \u2013 any slippage leads to the kind of language heard by Gina. Put those two factors together and you have the potential for major compromises: for some blocks being put back in the project, even if that means people live in squalor for years; for the builder to eat up courtyards and recreational areas in order to cram in more flats. And ultimately, building the wrong homes for the residents.     Jane Frost in her flat in Woodberry Down. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Before Woodberry Down began its metamorphosis into Woodberry Park, it had 1,555 social rented homes: 78.5% of the entire estate. By the time it finishes, it will have only 1,088 socially rented homes. That is a huge drop in a borough that already has more than 15,000 applicants on its housing waiting list \u2013 many with a family. True, there will be another 1,177 \u201caffordable\u201d homes \u2013 although many leaseholders on the estate told us they couldn\u2019t afford them. Nearly 60% of the overhauled site will be private homes. The showroom On a bright Saturday morning, Naoufal Dhimi parks his SUV outside Woodberry Down\u2019s marketing suite. The camel-coated property agent buys and sells London homes, primarily for investors in Asia and the Middle East. Although sceptical about the investment value of paying nearly \u00a3400,000 for a two-bed flat in what remains a deprived patch of inner London, he\u2019s scouting out the development for a client in Singapore. Hearing his explanation, the white-shirted saleswoman points through the windows to the reservoir: \u201cThat water outside: very attractive to Asian buyers. We\u2019ve had families from Singapore who take a unit here to rent out, but really keep it to send their children when they\u2019re old enough to go to the LSE [London School of Economics] or wherever.\u201d When marketing began, Berkeley concentrated its efforts on east Asia and ended up selling around 55% of the first phase of buildings to overseas investors. That\u2019s unusually high for this area. Going through Land Registry records, estate agents Knight Frank calculated that overseas residents bought 49% of all newly built property in the plushest parts of central London in the year to June 2013; that proportion dropped to 20% across inner London and to less than 7% in outer London. This estate sits slap-bang on the divide between inner and outer London, yet its towers have lured a greater proportion of foreign buyers than those in Kensington and Westminster. How did Berkeley manage that? Expert marketing. The firm has sales offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and, as of last autumn, Beijing. To flog Woodberry Park, it hired out ballrooms and conference suites in hotels thousands of miles away and talked to small Asian families about the profit to be made from letting apartments in London. According to the British Property Federation, 61% of all new homes sold in the capital last year were bought not to live in but solely as an investment. The vast majority of them would have been rented out; 5% were flipped back onto the market.     Woodberry Down regeneration project in Manor House, London. New builds near the reservoir and old flats nearer Seven Sisters Road. Photograph: Martin Godwin    The saleswoman hands over goodybags with brochures that resemble coffee table books. They paint the area in terms no local would ever recognise. Expertly shot panoramas of the estate and the London skyline make it seem a mere jog from the City. Distances to airports are listed, along with cafes \u201con your doorstep\u201d that are in nicer areas at least 20 minutes schlep away. This isn\u2019t Manor House at all, but an invented place wrenched away from terra firma and now hovering somewhere between a street of chichi cafes and the financial district. At Berkeley, Matt Bell defends the marketing: \u201cIf you go \u2018it\u2019s 20 minutes from Knightsbridge\u2019, people go online and \u2026 you look a complete monkey.\u201d He obviously hasn\u2019t read his own brochure, which claims Woodberry Down is just \u201c23 minutes\u201d from Knightsbridge. Later, Dhimi recounts how a client bought an apartment here off-plan from one of those hotel suites a world away. When it was finished, he drove her directly from Heathrow to have a look. \u201cAs we got closer, the surroundings got rougher and she went quiet. And when we arrived she said: \u2018Dhimi, I can\u2019t stay here: put me in a hotel.\u2019 The next morning she wanted to sell up. Immediately.\u201d As the saleswoman shows us around the two-bed showflat, she admits that, on turning up at the marketing suits in this still-gritty part of North London: \u201cI thought head office were punishing me!\u201d By the architects\u2019 model of the estate, she explains to us, her prospective buyers, how any unit we\u2019d buy would be safely away from the social tenants. This development \u201cis going to end up like an island\u201d, insulated from the surrounding deprivation.Leafing through the hardback, one other thing jumps out: all the models in it \u2013 sleek young couples sipping rose \u2013 are white. According to the 2011 census, Hackney\u2019s population is 45% black and minority ethnic; yet Berkeley\u2019s dream community is as multicultural as a Boden catalogue. This is in a brochure whose primary readership is east Asian. As we drive past the doner places and charity shops that go unmentioned in the marketing, Dhimi is surprisingly agitated. The real-estate dealer says he was raised in a council house and was \u201cshocked\u201d at the language used by the saleswoman. \u201cWhat kind of city are we becoming: like Paris, where we chuck all the \u2018social rubbish\u2019 on the edges out of sight?\u201d Veronica and Nanette  It takes two buses, one train and two and a half hours for Veronica Mensah to get from her new home to her old one on Woodberry Down; and it costs her \u00a322.95 \u2013 almost a third of her weekly state pension. \u201cI\u2019m worried the fares will keep going up, but there are some things you can\u2019t put a price on: my family and friends, they\u2019re all here. So I\u2019ll just have to sacrifice things to be able to afford it. I have built my world here.\u201d This time she has come down for a prayer meeting of the Franciscan order to which she has belonged for over a decade. After, she catches up with two other members, Elizabeth and Betty, who she met while on the estate. Veronica asks who wants tea. Softly spoken, she wears a long grey skirt and a lavender scarf. Have they known each other long? \u201cOh yes!\u201d they chorus, before a flurry of anecdotes begin, overlapping and hard to make out \u2013 organising church bazaars, living in the same blocks, having children grow up together. Elizabeth looks up and laughs: \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for ever.\u201d Veronica moved to Woodberry Down in 1979 with her then-husband to start a family. After their third child, their two-bedroom flat was no longer big enough and they registered to be transferred. They remained on the council\u2019s transfer list for 17 years. In that time Veronica became a respected figure on the estate and beyond. She worked in health and childcare, volunteered for two charities and got heavily involved in her local church. Her parents \u2013 now in their 80s \u2013 live 15 minutes up the road from Woodberry Down, and she would often take them to hospital appointments and look after them when they were ill. As Veronica\u2019s three children turned into teens, they needed more space. \u201cThey had nowhere to do their homework.\u201d So in 2000, now-divorced Veronica bought her flat under right-to-buy. The plan was to sell it after the stipulated minimum ownership period of three years and buy a bigger place for her family elsewhere on the estate. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really something I could afford to do. But I just had to find a way to get more space for my family.\u201d Six months later, Hackney council announced the regeneration and Veronica could no longer sell up. She and her two adult children had lost all the rights they had as longstanding tenants. Those renting from Hackney were guaranteed a home; leaseholders only got a compensatory offer on their homes, and a shot at the new affordable units. To stay on the estate, Veronica would have to wait over a decade until her flat was due for demolition. The alternative was to sell her home back to the council and leave. \u201cI took the decision not to live somewhere until my 70s and then move. It would be a big upheaval, whereas if I left while still mobile and relatively fit, it wouldn\u2019t be as bad.\u201d After over two years of back and forth, Hackney offered Veronica \u00a3220,000 for her two-bedroom flat. Allowing for mortgage and service charges, and giving her children, who still lived with her, some money to help them move elsewhere, Veronica had a budget nearer \u00a3150,000. On state pension and so ineligible for a mortgage, she had to buy outright. She couldn\u2019t find anything nearby: even the one-bedroom ex-council flat next door to the prison was way above her price limit. \u201cI would have had to move so far out of London it would have been the same travel-time back to my family as moving away completely.\u201d Last summer she bought a house on a similar housing estate \u2013 this time in Ipswich, 80 miles away from her the place she still calls &quot;home&quot;. \u201cThe most stressful part was leaving my parents behind. It took me a while to accept that I was going to have to do that.\u201d She\u2019s not alone in being displaced. Around one in five of Woodberry Down residents are leaseholders, and we met a number who were moving to the outskirts of London and the home counties. Life in Ipswich is \u201cunsettled\u201d. The new house is bigger than her old flat, but it needs major work so she hasn\u2019t been able to move all her things in. Her busy life in London is now limited to monthly visits, hectic long weekends crammed with friends and family. It\u2019s the opposite in Ipswich. \u201cMy day-to-day now is just going to the shops for a newspaper. I don\u2019t go out as much now, at all \u2013 to the extent that I still regularly phone people back on the estate to talk, and it\u2019s costing me quite a lot of money. But I haven\u2019t made any friends there. Things are not the same as in London. \u201cAnd leaving two of my children was a wrench. They wanted to be in London for work. My main worry is that they won\u2019t be able to stay because they\u2019re not rich. Our teachers, our nurses, our carers \u2013 they\u2019re being priced out like I was. And we need them. Nobody\u2019s dealing with that.\u201d Run Veronica\u2019s story by those pushing through the regeneration and the responses vary in tone but amount to the same. Hackney council stresses its commitment to keeping the Woodberry Down residents on the estate, but councilor Karen Alcock says the pledge doesn\u2019t apply to leaseholders. After listening to the story, Piers Clanford, managing director of Berkeley Homes (Capital), says, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to live in Mayfair.\u201d But the difference is he doesn\u2019t already live in Mayfair; Veronica has been winched out of her home. \u201cHmm.\u201d Veronica\u2019s daughter Nanette bought a one-bedroom flat in the new development, through the shared-ownership scheme. Sitting in the Happy Man estate pub \u2013 soon to be demolished to build more flats \u2013 the charity worker says: \u201cI know the area, I\u2019ve grown up here, I know people; so I wanted to stay here.\u201d The same goes for her brother (who has asked not to be named), who slept on Nanette\u2019s sofa for six months because he wanted to find another home on the estate rather than move away. He now pays a private landlord \u00a31,400 a month to rent a one-bedroom flat in a new block just across the road from the one in which he was raised.\u201cWhen I was growing up here I would see about five or 10 people to talk to a day. And recognise about 10 or 20,\u201d she says. She\u2019s happy to have stayed on the estate, but life in the new flat has brought less tangible encounters: \u201cI know a lot of people in my block by email, now. You don\u2019t really see people.\u201d She contrasts the young professionals in the new blocks to the large population of families and elderly people on the original estate. \u201cYou can definitely tell the difference between the old and the new. There have been a few tensions,\u201d she says, referring in particular to race. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear segregation of income.\u201d So why cling to a home that\u2019s disappearing? \u201cBecause I want to claim my land. That sounds funny, doesn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s the estate where my mum lived and I want to show: you can\u2019t get rid of me that easily\u201d. Mehmet     Mehmet, who lost his chippie in Woodberry Down and has opened a new takeaway in Edmonton. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Mehmet Kerem keeps a photo of himself on his shop wall. It\u2019s just over a year old, yet customers regularly comment on how different he looks now. Next to the picture, the 45-year-old looks greyer, thinner. \u201cI thought it was a photo of his brother,\u201d says one of the regulars. The family snapshot was taken as Mehmet moved to his new takeaway in Edmonton, on the outskirts of London. The opening cost him about a hundred grand in lease, counters and other fixtures, \u201ceverything new\u201d \u2013 and he\u2019s struggling to make back his lifesavings and family loans. For nearly a decade, Mehmet ran a chippie on the little parade of shops at the heart of Woodberry Down. Over there, he\u2019d take about \u00a32,500 a week; here, a 45-minute bus ride away, it\u2019s roughly half that \u2013 despite working seven days a week, from eight in the morning till almost midnight. When the regeneration began, Mehmet and his fellow shopkeepers were promised units in the rebuilt estate. Every retailer we\u2019ve spoken to is clear that the offer was made in meetings with Hackney council (who ran the leases) and Berkeley. They were shown plans and invited to put in for their chosen premises. Then that promise was broken. Now only some businesses were going to transfer across, and that didn\u2019t include the takeaways (different reasons are given as to why: the most common is simply that flat-buyers would find it harder to get big mortgages for flats above a takeaway). Mehmet offered a compromise: \u201cA nice Turkish restaurant\u201d. But no. Nor could he agree another suitable site with the council. In 2012, Hackney gave him \u00a39,000 and told him to leave.Some of the teatime trade have been listening in. At the end, one mutters, \u201cNine grand and they throw him away like rubbish.\u201d Mehmet counts how much he spent on the shop at Woodberry Down: \u00a3100,000. He borrowed from everyone \u2013 friends, brothers and sisters in Cyprus \u2013 to set up his new, now-failing business. Those aren\u2019t the only losses. Soon after Mehmet was kicked out of Hackney, his father died \u2013 he thinks because of the stress. Money worries led to a breakup with his girlfriend of six years, also the mother of his daughter. Recounting all this, he tugs at his polo shirt and begins shouting, \u201cEverything is lost. Ten years of working for nothing.\u201d Sitting behind the counter is Mehmet\u2019s mother. \u201cHe\u2019s cracking up, he\u2019s nervous all the time, he\u2019s ageing,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was never angry before.\u201d Despite the promises, a mere handful of the old businesses remain on the rebuilt estate. Many of them are badly missed by the residents, especially the semi-legendary Chinese takeaway. A petition was started to save the shops. which got over 600 signatures, but ignored.Mehmet spots racism in these choices; but former off-licence manager Cigdem Garip puts it more broadly: \u201cWe didn\u2019t fit in.\u201d The residents of Woodberry Down are being provincialised: Veronica has literally been carted off to the provinces, but some of those who remain feel their tastes are not rarefied enough for their new home. As Jane\u2019s friend, Sheila says, \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed a Chinese, we\u2019re not allowed a fish and chip shop.\u201d An adviser to the residents carries around a presentation of the shops Berkeley suggested as examples for the new development. One is Labour &amp; Wait in Shoreditch: a homeware store where a \u201cJapanese kettle\u201d costs \u00a386. But posh boutiques also suit councillors, now running an increasingly-unequal borough. Hackney is at the same time among the most deprived in England and also more prosperous than the national average. To cater for the new wealth, the town hall is creating a \u00a3100m \u201cfashion hub\u201d selling top labels. It also wants to dilute the presence of ethnic-minority restaurants in the borough. The Guardian has seen a letter from a senior council officer asking restaurateurs to consider setting up in Dalston. It states: \u201cThe offer at the moment is essentially Turkish and African ... We are keen to attract a wider offer and a style of restaurants to the area.\u201d Of the entire parade, the electrical-goods shop was the oldest. Jonathan Devan inherited it from his father; it finally shut just after the 59th anniversary. A road on the estate has been named in the family\u2019s honour: Devan Grove. As Jonathan wanders around the estate he still calls \u201chome\u201d, old ladies struggling with their grocery shopping stop to say hello. He tells one: \u201cI\u2019m not my own boss any more, I work for someone else \u2013 much less of a headache.\u201d He has gone from proprietor to part-time helping hand in a friend\u2019s shop, but accepts the change as \u201cinevitable\u201d. He gestures at the just-opened juice bar, selling thimble-sized cupcakes for \u00a31.95 a bite: \u201cI was never going to fit in with that, was I?\u201d Micky              You can spot Micky\u2019s launch party from 100 metres away. The rest of the strip is quiet, with businesses yet to move into the empty units, but the entrance to his barbershop has a bunch of young men in suits tussling with silver balloons. Inside, past the toddlers in waistcoats and the young women in makeup, is Micky Souleiman himself: 26, suited and booted and apparently relaxed about taking on his first business. That champagne glass must be helping; but up close there are flecks of white emulsion on his fingers, proving he was up till 4am doing the finishing touches. Micky has known Mehmet for years and feels bad about what\u2019s happened to him. But he\u2019s positioned himself to take advantage of the opportunities offered by his home moving upmarket. Not for him the trad barbers up the road, with their big black-and-white photos of men in buzzcuts; here everything is monochrome and co-ordinated. When the inevitable pictures do go up, they\u2019ll be of Ali and De Niro. \u201cThis is high-end,\u201d he says, gesturing at the decor. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be luxury.\u201d How so? \u201cIt will be more English-style than other ones around here.\u201d Ask Berkeley which local businesses they see prospering and Micky is one they mention. You can see why: he\u2019s young and has an affable smartness that deserves a spot of sunshine. \u201cThe regeneration is definitely a good thing,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s getting new flats, the place is being done up.\u201d So what does it need next? A Turkish restaurant, he says, before correcting himself: \u201cMediterranean. A nice Mediterranean.\u201d Three flat-capped old geezers turn up. One of them peers around and says in a accent straight out of central-casting East End: \u201cIt\u2019s like a fucking club, not a barber\u2019s.\u201d Ian and Yvonne On the top floor of one of the new blocks for those paying subsidised rents live Ian and Yvonne Kleinberg. If you can peel your eyes away from their view, Ian will show you the photos of his three kids and reel off their careers: America, teaching, osteopathy \u2026 \u201cI always say that if you want to, you can make it from Woodberry Down,\u201d he says.If anyone in this tableau should consider themselves winners, it\u2019s these two. They have moved from crocked council housing into the kind of apartment that would go like a hotcake on the open market; the kids have done well and ahead lie the pleasures of the first phase of retired life. The couple go along with that story, but then point out a few downsides. Yvonne: \u201cWhen we walk outside, the tenants from the private block actually cross the road to avoid us.\u201d Ian: \u201cSay you\u2019re social [tenants in subsidised rental accommodation] around here and you go down like a bacon sandwich at a Jewish wedding.\u201d The move also means a different rental arrangement: they no longer rent from the state, but from a private-sector housing association, Genesis. They now have fewer rights as tenants but, they say, worse service and higher bills. \u201cThere are pensioners in this block getting themselves in debt just to afford the heating,\u201d says Ian.     Maxwell outside at the new regeneration site at Woodberry Park. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    The couple met on this estate, when as a teenager Yvonne used to hang around watching Ian play football. Public space plays an important part in Woodberry memories: Sheila and Jane used to run about in apple orchards; Veronica would call in Nanette from playing in the courtyard. When the estate was built, 20 of the 64 acres were designated for playgrounds, tennis courts and a community centre. But the public space is being swallowed up by concrete as the developers cram in more flats to maximise profit. The best way to picture what\u2019s going on is by imagining the patch of grass in the middle of an athletics track, which normally comes to one hectare. Before regeneration, about 83 homes were on each of those grass patches. Berkeley planned to more than double that, to 194 dwellings a hectare. Last summer, it announced that it would build even more homes on the estate. That patch of grass will now have 224 homes on it.  Paul  Paul O\u2019Neill sits on a cafe terrace in Stoke Newington, still in Hackney but a quarter of an hour east from Manor House and around \u00a3100,000 north in property prices. Tearing into his croissant, he tells us that it\u2019s here he really wanted to live. But he and his girlfriend couldn\u2019t afford the rents nearby, so became some of the first tenants in the flagship tower. Last September, Paul left a comment on a blog about the regeneration. Far from being defensive, he was clear-eyed: \u201cIt was a big risk for us moving here \u2026 the area was already known for its anti-social behaviour \u2026 but I simply couldn\u2019t afford anywhere else in London.\u201d That said, Woodberry Park isn\u2019t affordable either: they pay \u00a3300 a week for \u201ca kitchen-cum-living room and a tiny bedroom.\u201d Young skilled professionals, Paul and his heavily-pregnant girlfriend are the pandas of London\u2019s housing market: the ones every politician coos over, while fretting that without a major intervention they may soon die out in the capital. \u201cDavid Cameron\u2019s dream\u201d is how Paul ironically refers to himself. Matt Bell at Berkeley argues that the real gap in the London market is starter homes for young professionals on \u00a330-40,000 a year. But Woodberry Park isn\u2019t going to fill that hole: a one-bed flat there can go for up to \u00a3400,000 \u2013 and no lender currently offers mortgages worth 12-times salary.     Micky in his trendy new barber's shop in Woodberry Park. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Paul has a mental map of the London he can afford: it comprises only the edges and even they keep shrinking as prices \u201cgallop away\u201d. At the moment the budget just about stretches to a home in Walthamstow, on the northern periphery of London \u2013 but he reckons that once the baby comes and the family\u2019s settled down: \u201cIt will probably be too expensive, so we\u2019ll be looking for the next place out of London, which is \u2026 I don\u2019t even know. \u201cMy eventual dream is to live in Italy: your lovely little house in Tuscany, doing web design, eating Italian food all day. But if I\u2019m honest, the reality is I\u2019ll end up moving miles out of London, paying exorbitant train fares, desperately scrambling to find a nice school for the kids.\u201dPaul leases his flat from a Singaporean investor who he\u2019s never met: \u201cAll of my neighbours rent from foreign absentee landlords.&quot; This fits the picture drawn in the property pages of the British press, which often depict would-be London housebuyers as battling an army of invisible competitors: Russian oligarchs, Saudi sheikhs and, at the other end of the market, anxious Greek professionals and Asian nuclear families. Yet the forces that have driven Singaporeans over here are rarely spelt out. Let us try. From the Land Registry records, we see that Paul\u2019s landlord lives near Changi airport in an ochre public housing block, in an area carpeted with other public blocks. No shame there: about 85% of all Singaporeans live in Housing and Development Board quarters, or HDBs for short. In the wealthy entrepot, interest rates are also bumping around record-low levels and property prices have taken off. The big difference is that since 2009, Singapore\u2019s government has chucked bucket after bucket of cold water onto the overheating housing market. It\u2019s clamped down on loans, jacked up stamp duty, punished people who sell property they\u2019ve bought only recently \u2013 and levied punitive taxes on foreigners buying homes. In short, almost every policy urged on David Cameron over the past few years \u2013 and left unwrapped \u2013 has been deployed by Lee Hsien Loong. The message is simple: Singapore doesn\u2019t welcome property speculation. But the island\u2019s dentists and middle managers and other cautious savers are welcomed by the overseas agents of Berkeley and its competitors, offering rental units in the no-questions-asked capital of the world. This new market has brought with it a new speculative architecture, says Duncan Bowie, now at the University of Westminster. Developers are responding to the demands of investors wanting one- or two-bed flats to rent out, rather than family homes to live in. That produces an odd Animal Farm-ish logic: \u201cCouncil high-rises are bad; private high-rises apparently good.\u201d A few weeks before we went to press, Paul and his girlfriend became parents to Zara: brown hair, blue eyes and 3.3kg at birth. Around the same time, their landlord sold the flat, apparently to a cash buyer from Germany. Paul and family have found another apartment in the same development. All\u2019s fine now, he reports, but it was a lot of stress at the time. Urchins Every building worth a damn sets in concrete (or glass or Jura limestone) the social tensions of its age. As Herbert Morrison was dreaming up Woodberry Down, the fundamental argument was over the rights that should be afforded the only recently enfranchised working class. On hearing the MP\u2019s plans to stick municipal housing on their doorstep, one Stoke Newington resident objected to \u201call these urchins from the East End coming round my drinking water\u201d. Nimbyism was evidently more plainspoken in 1936. By the estate\u2019s completion in 1948, the argument had been won. Britain was entering its high-point as an economic democracy, with electricity, rail, even the Bank of England put into public hands. Woodberry Down was part of that: a physical assertion that the capital belonged to its working classes as much as to anyone else. Contrast that with the era embodied by Woodberry Park. The rebuild comes after 30 years in which our major public assets \u2013 water, gas, council housing \u2013 have been sold dirt-cheap, to end up in the hands of a small elite.More and more parts of London, too, are off limits to Londoners. Think of those unaffordable super-rich islands; the privately-owned finance tracts such as Canary Wharf; the gated communities. Listen to the constant uptick of house prices, that metronome for commuters in the capital. Most blatantly, there is the coalition\u2019s cap on housing benefit, which will expunge the inner city of its privately-renting poor. Woodberry Park is part of this new culture. Houses as speculative assets, not homes. Houses as speculative assets, not homes. Paul will tell you of the human fallout. Financial viability trumping desperate need? Speak to Gina. Woodberry Down\u2019s residents were initially told that this rebuilding was for them. A few years on, it isn\u2019t working out like that. Veronica and other leaseholders have been hoisted off; social housing on the site will plunge; remaining tenants will have higher outgoings and less green space. Park any cynicism you may have about big builders and accept for a moment that this is a textbook example of public-private regeneration. Then look at the stories above and ask if the textbook doesn\u2019t need major revision. The tour  In the same spot that Naoufal Dhimi pulled up in his SUV weeks earlier, eight people bundle out of a minivan, to be greeted by Emma \u2013 a smiling representative from Berkeley Homes. She leads them into a room with a large model of Woodberry Park at the centre. The famous resident survey booklet is handed out.  The visitors are from Brixton, south London, sent here by Lambeth council to draw lessons for their own regeneration. \u201cWoodberry Down is very much a partnership,\u201d says Emma. \u201cIt\u2019s not just: \u2018Hi we\u2019re Berkeley, we\u2019re going to knock everything down, build and see you later\u2019.\u201d She lists the community assets, including a primary school, a health centre and a church that have all existed on the estate for decades. But when a guest asks about the project\u2019s financing, they\u2019re stonewalled: \u201cIn money terms, I couldn\u2019t answer.\u201d Now comes the grand tour. Pulling out notebooks, the visitors spill out into the sunshine, ready to be inspired."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/may/20/royal-mail-city-mixed-before-results", "sentences": ["We have looked at a range of postal peers, including Austrian Post, bpost (Belgium), CTT (Portugal), DP, PostNL (Netherlands), Singapore Post and UK Mail."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-20T10:59:32Z", "title": "Royal Mail prompts mixed City views ahead of full year figures", "tags": ["Business", "Royal Mail"], "article": "Ahead of its first full year results as a listed company, due on Thursday, there seems to be a divergence of opinion on the Royal Mail. On the positive side of the fence is Berenberg&apos;s Matthew O&apos;Keeffe, who has just issued a buy note with a price target of 700p. As a reminder the company controversially floated at 330p a share and currently stands at 568p, up 2.5p. Even the most negative commentators have price targets well above October&apos;s flotation price. But first the positive. Berenberg said:  We forecast 2014 revenue growth of 2.4% to \u00a39.50bn (consensus \u00a39.45bn). Our revenue estimate is based on a 4% year on year decline in UK letter and market mail revenues to \u00a34.60bn, which should be more than offset by a 10.8% year on year increase in parcel revenues to \u00a33.30bn. We forecast that General Logistics Services will increase revenues by 7%, contributing \u00a31.60bn to Royal Mail&apos;s top line. Consequently, 2014 will be the first year in which the revenue contribution from parcels will be more significant than revenues from letters.  We forecast earnings before interest and tax and before transformation costs of \u00a3615m in 2014, some 3% ahead of consensus, which currently stands at \u00a3597m.  A purely relative valuation supports 700p per share. We have looked at a range of postal peers, including Austrian Post, bpost (Belgium), CTT (Portugal), DP, PostNL (Netherlands), Singapore Post and UK Mail. The most highly-rated stock within this peer group is also the smallest (UK Mail), and the lowest-rated stock is not much bigger (PostNL). We have therefore weighted our postal peer group by market cap... Whether we look at PE, enterprise value/EBITDA or enterprise value/sales, Royal Mail is trading at a relative discount to its peer group, and if we look at dividend yield it is trading at a premium. At 700p, Royal Mail would be trading more like parity.   Over at Espirito Santo, Alex Paterson is less keen:  Since we initiated coverage on the 5 December, Royal Mail has achieved a positive settlement with the CWU, continued its efficiency programme and reported trading in line with guidance. However, the competitive landscape has intensified significantly, with TNT Post UK rolling out [end-to-end delivery] competition and significant capacity growth, enhanced service and Sunday and evening delivery from other parcel operators.  Whilst we think Royal Mail does have scope to raise efficiency and improve its technology, we are increasingly concerned that the rate of decline in letter volumes will become unmanageable, it will be unable to evolve its parcel service offering quickly enough to maintain market share and the market itself will struggle to absorb the level of new capacity.  Additionally, we expect the government will try to sell at least some of its 30% stake post results and anticipate this will overhang the stock. We therefore cut our recommendation from buy to neutral, decrease our fair value from 635p to 560p and lower our earnings per share forecasts by 25% and 9% for 2014 and 2015 respectively.  And Robin Byde at Cantor Fitzgerald issued a sell note with a 500p target price:  We forecast full year revenue of \u00a39.4bn with an operating profit before transformation costs of \u00a3680m. The market consensus range for full year operating profit is \u00a3617m to \u00a3698m, with an average of \u00a3668m. This broad range reflects the high operational gearing of the business and uncertainty over core addressed letter volumes, parcel volumes and prices.  In late March 2014, Royal Mail announced a further round of job cuts, with a further 1,300 to depart. Total transformation costs for the full year were lifted by \u00a370m to \u00a3230m. We expect an update on cost cutting and negotiations with the unions.  The dividend payment is a key issue for many investors. Royal Mail has guided to \u00a3133m (or 13.3p per share, yield 2.3%) as a final dividend for 2013, payable in July 2014. Market consensus is for a dividend [in 2014] of 21.8p share, a 3.8% yield. We note that historically European parcel companies have offered a 4%-5% yield, in part, to offset the risks to earnings growth from a decline in the core letters business. On the 2014 outlook, we assume Royal Mail will not provide &quot;hard&quot; profit guidance at this stage of the year.  We believe that Royal Mail&apos;s earnings are likely to come under pressure due to its uncompetitive cost base, declining core letter activity and pricing pressure in parcels.

He is dismissed by his opponents as an elitist, self-funded businessman who lacks the common touch. And he has a habit of putting his foot in his mouth. Meet David Perdue, the leading Republican running for Georgia\u2019s open Senate seat and, voters could be forgiven for concluding, the state&apos;s answer to Mitt Romney. Perdue came out on top of Georgia\u2019s Republican primary contest on Tuesday, making him the most likely candidate to take on Democrat Michelle Nunn in what is expected to be a tight race in November. Georgia is one of the most crucial Senate contests in the midterms \u2013 one of only two Republican-held seats (the other being Kentucky) that Democrats believe they have a chance of winning. Outside of the state, Perdue is a virtual unknown \u2013 he doesn&apos;t even have a Wikipedia page. He poured more than $2.7m of his own money to win the first leg of the primary race, which now goes to a 22 July runoff between Perdue and congressman Jack Kingston, who came in second in Tuesday\u2019s voting. Perdue is running as a strong, fiscally conservative candidate, decrying the national debt and promising to unwind regulation of the financial sector. He is also positioning himself as an outsider, repeating the line that his four main opponents in the primary were &quot;career politicians&quot;. Perdue is certainly new to the game. Privately, his friends confide they have seen him evolve into a more polished orator. But his claims to being an outsider are at odds with the fact that he looks very much like an insider: over the past few months, he walked and talked more like a politician than any of his opponents. The similarities with Romney are manifold. Both are clean-cut men in their 60s, with important family connections. Romney&apos;s father was the governor of Michigan and a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968. Perdue has one of the most recognized names in Georgia politics, courtesy of his cousin, Sonny Perdue, who was the state&apos;s governor until three years ago.     Georgia Republican Senate candidate, David Perdue, left, talks with his mother Gervaise Perdue, at an election night party. Photograph: David Goldman/AP    Mitt Romney ran the private equity firm Bain Capital, while Perdue has been CEO of corporate giants Reebok and Dollar General. And, as the Guardian overheard one Republican barber in Atlanta observing, the two men even have similar hair. Interviewed by the Guardian after he arrived by campaign jet at an airport in Columbus, 100 miles south of Atlanta, on Monday, Perdue did not dismiss the comparison. &quot;I have a lot of respect for Mitt Romney,&quot; he said. &quot;If we would all have done what we should have, he would be president.&quot; However there are two attributes Perdue shares with Romney that could, like the former Republican presidential candidate, prove his undoing. Perdue is gaffe prone, and he has a corporate past that may now come back to haunt him. Twice during the early primary campaign, Perdue made the kinds of mistakes that a more accomplished politician would avoid. The first came in early April, when he dismissed foe Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state from humble roots, as a &quot;high school graduate&quot;. It was a major error, compounding his image as an elitist snob. Handel, who narrowly lost out for the second runoff spot on Tuesday, fought back hard. At a campaign event on Monday, she told a group of supporters: &quot;He looks down on those of us who have figured out a way to make life good and be successful \u2013 despite long odds.&quot; Perdue\u2019s second mistake, committed in the final days of the campaign, was a cardinal sin in today\u2019s Republican Party: he appeared to suggest he would support tax hikes. Corporate man He tried to row back from the blip, made during a discussion with the editorial board of the Macon Telegraph. Still, it was a mistake capitalised on by Kingston, who told the Guardian that Perdue &quot;presided over the largest firing in the textile industry&quot;. Perdue&apos;s opponents are seeking to portray him as an out-of-touch, corporate man \u2013 more suited to a boardroom in Singapore, Hong Kong or Paris (he has done business in all three) than a diner in small-town Georgia. Much of the dirt about his business past has been dug up by Democrats, who have sat back and relished the show of Republican candidates bruise one another. Perdue and Kingston will spend another nine weeks slugging it out. Democrats in Georgia believe Nunn, the daughter of former Democratic senator Sam Nunn, has a path to victory against either candidate \u2013 albeit a rough one. Privately, top Democratic party officials are most hopeful about a race against Perdue, believing a ruthless business career will come back to haunt him. It is a biography that stands in contrast to that of Nunn, who can also run as a Washington outsider and, although one who, due to the good fortune of a merger of two charities in 2007, can boast she is CEO of Points of Light, a foundation inspired by former president George Bush Sr and still connected to the Bush family. Perdue&apos;s victory party was a fairly subdued affair. Unsurprisingly for a man who has not been in politics long enough to generate a base, it was sparsely attended, with many of those who went describing themselves as friends of the Perdue family. Most preferred to point out the differences \u2013 most obviously that Romney is a Mormon, while Perdue is a baptist. Romney is also a long-time Republican politician, while Perdue is new to the game. One or two people pointed out that Romney and Perdue ran different kinds of businesses. &quot;They look the same,&quot; said Mike Ross, a small businessman, who acknowledged some similarities. &quot;And they both carry themselves in analogous way. And they both know what money is and how it works.&quot; Neil Sessions, whose preferred candidate, Arthur Gardner, came in last with less than 1% of the Republican vote \u2013 by virtue, he said, of being &quot;the only moderate in the race&quot; \u2013 concurred that Perdue is Romney-like &quot;David is polished, David is good,&quot; he said. &quot;Mitt was good, Mitt was polished.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/military-coup-thailand-peace-general-prayuth-chan-ocha", "sentences": ["&quot;This coup looks like many others going back to the 1970s: the language used, the seeming solidarity among the main branches of the security forces,&quot; said Michael Montesano, co-coordinator of the Thailand studies programme at Singapore&apos;s institute of south-east Asian studies."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-23T05:44:00Z", "title": "Coup needed for Thailand 'to love and be at peace again' - army chief", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Thailand&apos;s army seized control of the country and suspended the constitution on Thursday after rival factions failed in talks to end six months of political turmoil, causing the nation&apos;s 19th coup in 82 years. General Prayuth Chan-ocha, head of the army and now acting prime minister, did not use the word &quot;coup&quot; in his televised announcement to the nation but declared the takeover was necessary &quot;in order for the country to return to normality quickly, and for society to love and be at peace again&quot;. He added: &quot;We ask the public not to panic and to carry on their lives normally.&quot; On Friday the general summoned members of the politically pivotal Shinawatra family to a meeting. Yingluck Shinawatra was forced from office as caretaker prime minister earlier in the month by a court ruling; her brother, Thaksin, was ousted as prime minister by the military in 2006 and opponents argue the family exercises a corrupt grip on Thai politics that must be broken.  The Reuters news agency said Yingluck Shinawatra and the general were seen arriving on Friday at an army facility, while the army announced it had banned 155 people including politicians and activists from leaving the country &quot;in order to maintain peace and resolve the conflict&quot;. The surprise announcement of a full military takeover followed the unexpected late-night invocation of martial law on Tuesday, which the army said was not a coup but merely a peacekeeping move to &quot;restore order&quot; in a nation beleaguered by political in-fighting. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, in a strongly worded statement warning that the takeover would &quot;have negative implications for the US-Thai relationship&quot;, openly condemned Prayuth&apos;s move and said: &quot;There is no justification for this military coup.&quot; He added: &quot;I urge the restoration of civilian government immediately, a return to democracy, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, such as press freedoms. The path forward for Thailand must include early elections that reflect the will of the people.&quot; Bangkok&apos;s road traffic increased Thursday evening after the military announced a nationwide 10pm-5am curfew. Many people stocked up on essentials at supermarkets and small shops. The army also banned public gatherings of five or more people, suspended all television and radio stations (which are permitted to play only military signals), and established a special unit to monitor social media comment. Rival political factions have spent the past two days at Bangkok&apos;s Army Club, where they attempted to come to a compromise over the future of the country. The coup became apparent during Thursday&apos;s negotiations when Prayuth asked the caretaker justice minister, Chaikasem Nitisiri, whether the government was ready to resign. &quot;As of this minute, the government will not resign,&quot; Chaikasem allegedly answered, according to the English-language Nation newspaper. &quot;So, as of this minute, I decide to seize ruling power,&quot; Prayuth retorted. An electoral commissioner who was at the negotiations said that Prayuth had told the assembled company: &quot;Everyone must sit still.&quot; Rumours of a possible coup had been circulating since November, when anti-government protesters first took to the streets to demand the resignation of the incumbent Pheu Thai party. But Prayuth&apos;s seemingly sudden decision on Thursday \u2013 in the midst of negotiations between rival political groups \u2013 took many by surprise. &quot;The army clearly had no sincerity in brokering talks,&quot; said Michael Connors, a south-east Asia expert and associate professor at the Malaysia campus of the University of Notthingham. &quot;In retrospect [the coup] must have been calculated, and it looks like the [declaration of] martial law was just a pretext to deliver a strategic advantage to the coup group.&quot; Despite options reportedly being floated at the Prayuth-mediated talks at the Army Club no agreement was reached, although the rival leaders did tweet &quot;selfie&quot; pictures of themselves smiling and laughing together at the round-table discussions. All that changed, however, when hundreds of extra troops arrived at the venue and took away the leader of the anti-government protests, Suthep Thaugsuban. Various other leaders have also been detained, including members of the opposition party, of the Pheu Thai government, plus members of the pro-government Red Shirts and anti-government People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). Thailand&apos;s caretaker prime minister, Niwutthamrong Boonsongpaisan, who assumed the role this month after Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office by a controversial court ruling, was not at the meeting on Thursday and his location was unknown. Rumours that he could have been at the US embassy were denied publicly, and the army asked him to turn himself in. Prayuth had warned he wanted an end to the political warring that, since November, as anti-government protesters begancalling for a new, appointed, government, has led to the deaths of 28 people and caused injury to more than 700 others. &quot;This must be resolved swiftly before I retire, otherwise I won&apos;t retire,&quot; said Prayuth, who is due to step down at the end of September. &quot;I will not allow Thailand to be like Ukraine or Egypt.&quot; The new Peace and Order Maintaining Command, which includes the army, navy and police, will now be in charge of governingthe country. The stated aim is to reform Thailand&apos;s economic, political and social structures, Prayuth said, though courts and parliament&apos;s upper house will continue as normal. Chiranuch Premchaiporn, press freedom advocate of the online news outlet Prachatai, told the Associated Press: &quot;Our problems will never be solved if people are not allowed to express their ideas and speak.&quot; The takeover was met with a warning by the Red Shirt activists&apos; group, the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), which vowed retaliationshortly after the televised statement. &quot;NOW it is COUP \u2013 stand by for a retaliation from the UDD,&quot; the group tweeted. Various governments, including those of France and Germany, as well as human rights groups, have condemned the military&apos;s move \u2013 the 19th coup since absolute monarchy was abolished here in 1932. &quot;The military&apos;s seizure of power has become routine and a sad reality of Thai politics,&quot; said Karim Lahidji, of the International Federation for Human Rights. &quot;Two days after it publicly declared that it was not going to stage a coup, the military seized power and plunged Thailand into a deeper political crisis.&quot; The junta warned it would block any social media platforms in the country found to carry content that incited violence or criticised military leaders. In a television bulletin the military urged &quot;co-operation from social media operators and all involved to stop such messages that incite violence, break the law or criticise the coup council&quot;. &quot;If we find any to be in violation we will suspend the service immediately and will summon those responsible for prosecution.&quot; Observers say Thailand&apos;s next move will depend on just how well the various factions, and the public, respond to the military takeover. &quot;This coup looks like many others going back to the 1970s: the language used, the seeming solidarity among the main branches of the security forces,&quot; said Michael Montesano, co-coordinator of the Thailand studies programme at Singapore&apos;s institute of south-east Asian studies. &quot;They&apos;ve inherited a mess and how they&apos;re going to manage it depends on how much resistance there is to the government that they attempt to install.&quot; Connors said, though, that the fact that there had been so much talk of resistance proved this coup was different from all the others. &quot;They&apos;ve never had a coup like this, in which this potential of mass resistance is so strong,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s only imaginable that this coup will be incredibly repressive as a response.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/may/24/holiday-guide-to-burgos-spain", "sentences": ["Sa\u00fal G\u00f3mez offers a cosmopolitan menu at his Blue Gallery (Paseo Comuneros de Castilla 19, +34 947 057451) with dishes such as dashi soup, tataki duck and Singapore crab."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-24T06:00:00Z", "title": "Holiday guide to Burgos, Spain", "tags": ["Spain holidays", "City breaks", "Short breaks", "Weekend breaks", "Hotels", "Restaurants", "Food and drink", "Spanish food and drink", "Bars and clubs", "Travel"], "article": "The New York Times called Burgos &quot;an ancient city with a fresh face and culinary buzz&quot;.

And the culinary buzz was generated by Burgos being gastronomic capital of Spain last year.

Initially, it was brickbats all the way: she was too low key, too out of her depth. Until, that is, 2013, when she helped to broker a groundbreaking peace deal between Serbia and Kosovo and played a vital role in nuclear negotiations with Iran. The lady (or, more precisely, the Baroness) is not so much redeemed, since she was given little time to fall from grace; but she is now, officially, a success. She is that rare and invaluable commodity for any state: a diplomat without an ego. The battle for women to first gain entry to a diplomatic career and then rise in spite of discrimination (often &quot;justified&quot; on the grounds that our damsels might be at risk from hot-blooded Johnny foreigner on overseas postings) is at the core of this book. The women are striking, the trajectories of their often brief careers compelling; but what is lacking are the contradictions and complexities of at least a couple of their lives, to give depth. As a result, it all seems a bit of an upper-class hoot. In the UK, it wasn&apos;t until 1946 that women could officially represent their country abroad; however, in both world wars they were temporarily recruited to the\u00a0Foreign Office as typists, clerks, code breakers and translators. Among\u00a0the more famous was the mountaineer, traveller and author Gertrude Bell, who, in 1915, aged 47, worked in the fledgling Arab Bureau in Cairo. She was called by one male MP &quot;a flat-chested, man-woman blathering ass&quot;, but was held in esteem by others. In 1939, Freya Stark, 46, fluent in Arabic, was sent to Yemen to sell the Allied cause to &quot;Arabia&quot;. Her aim was to create &quot;a democratic, pro-western Middle East&quot;. An author and broadcaster, she wore flowing robes and was fond of carrying her pet lizard, Himyar, round her neck. She frequently asked her bosses &quot;to let a man take over&quot;. There was Ann (&quot;Nancy&quot;) Lambton, 28, a Persian speaker who was sent to Tehran in 1939 to work as a press attach\u00e9 for Reader Bullard, the British minister. At war&apos;s end, he thanked her &quot;for overworking for six years for the public good&quot;. It was a time when Germany had 800 agents working undercover in Tehran \u2013 the stuff of adventure. Lambton subsequently strongly influenced postwar Middle Eastern policy, which \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 included the CIA coup that overthrew the nationalist Iranian leader, Mohammad Mosaddeq, in 1953. In 1942, Harold Nicolson said that the qualities required of a diplomat were male, &quot;impartial, imperturbable and a trifle inhuman&quot;. However, women were finally allowed entry to the Foreign Office in 1946 \u2013 a quota of only 10% of total staff, and marriage ended a career (a bar lifted in the 1970s). McCarthy, an academic, returns often to the issue of &quot;femininity&quot;, an apparently unchanging anchor in a dynamic man&apos;s\u00a0world. How a woman represents her country &quot;and herself&quot;, McCarthy writes, is &quot;a fundamental existential question&quot;. But\u00a0it&apos;s not the only question. Femininity is a social construct, changing with the times. Equally important are issues of ideology and class, little mentioned. My father was a morse code operator in the Diplomatic Wireless Service, posted to places such as the Sudan, Pakistan and Singapore. Highly skilled,\u00a0he was nevertheless \u2013 in background, education and rank \u2013 officially on the second rung of the diplomatic ladder, the first occupied by\u00a0locally employed staff. The hierarchy was vivid and real, picked up by me, as a child, by osmosis and petty displays of snobbery (napkins or serviettes?). In the 70s, the\u00a0Foreign Office made efforts to widen its talent pool; so\u00a0how have women (and men) drawn from more diverse backgrounds fared? How have\u00a0they (and Catherine Ashton,\u00a0born\u00a0into a mining family is one of them) presented a different face of diplomacy to the world? But, then again, perhaps that&apos;s another book."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/26/china-200-separatists-xinjiang-anti-terrorism-crackdown", "sentences": ["&quot;There is greater discontent now and recognition that the Uighur character of the region is being irretrievably lost,&quot; Ahmed Hashim, a terrorism expert at Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technical University, told Associated Press."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-26T14:10:03Z", "title": "China detains more than 200 suspected separatists in Xinjiang, state media says", "tags": ["Xinjiang", "China", "World news"], "article": "Police in China&apos;s troubled north-west region of Xinjiang have broken up 23 terror or extremist groups and detained more than 200 suspected militants in the last month, state media have reported. The news came as authorities said a year-long anti-terrorism crackdown would require &quot;unconventional measures&quot;, and the region&apos;s party chief, Zhang Chunxian, announced a &quot;people&apos;s war&quot; against terrorism, following one of the most deadly attacks in years. Forty-three people were killed and more than 90 injured in Xinjiang&apos;s capital, Urumqi, last Thursday when attackers in two off-road vehicles drove through a street market throwing explosives. Officials say four of the assailants died at the scene and a fifth was captured later that night. The attack was the latest in a string of incidents, and has led experts to warn of a mounting terrorist threat originating in the region. In March, a group armed with knives killed 33 people at a train station in Kunming, Yunnan province. A month later, three people were killed and scores were wounded when two suspected suicide bombers struck a station in Urumqi as Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visited the region. Chinese authorities blame separatists with ties to international terrorist networks for fomenting violence, while critics argue that the roots of the problem lie in the widespread alienation among region&apos;s Muslim Uighur population, which is resentful of religious and cultural controls, Han Chinese migration and being left behind by rapid economic development. Those seized in this month&apos;s raids were captured in Hotan, Kashgar and Aksu \u2013 all in southern Xinjiang \u2013 according to state news agency Xinhua. The state-run Global Times newspaper said most were apprehended on Sunday. &quot;Many of the suspects were in their 20s and 30s, who watched terror video and audio through the internet and electric storages and learned how to make explosives. They exchanged their experiences of making explosives and propagating jihad through chatting tools, text messages and illegal preaching sites, according to the department,&quot; said Xinhua, adding that more than 200 explosive devices were found. On Sunday the ministry of public security said police had launched a year-long crackdown on terrorism. In a statement it said police &quot;should only target terrorists and religious extremists and protect the legal rights and interests of ethnic minority people&quot;. Xinhua reported that police would pool information nationwide and improve co-ordination with other government departments to ensure that emergencies and investigations were handled better. A joint statement the previous day from legal and security authorities in Xinjiang called for tipoffs and said those involved in terrorist activities would be treated more leniently if they turned themselves in. The Global Times said the authorities had vowed &quot;ultra-tough measures and unconventional means&quot; in the crackdown. Li Wei, an anti-terrorism expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times that villages where underground preaching was prevalent would be targeted. &quot;Despite the stressing of ultra-toughness and unconventional means, the campaign will still be carried out in the framework of law,&quot; Li said. Maya Wang, of Human Rights Watch, which has condemned Thursday&apos;s attack as an atrocity, said the authorities should arrest and prosecute those responsible. &quot;That makes it even more important that the criminal process, from arrest to imprisonment, is conducted in ways that ensure they catch the right people and that there is due process,&quot; she said. &quot;It is important not just for the protection of suspects, but also for protecting the public from further such attacks.&quot; She warned that high-profile drives to target particular kinds of crime often resulted in the suspension of basic civil rights safeguards, increasing the risk of false confessions obtained under duress. Wang added that the government had a history of conflating violent extremism with peaceful dissent voiced by critics such as the Uighur scholar Ilham Tohti, detained on suspicion of inciting separatism. Michael Clarke, an expert on the region at Griffith University in Australia, said: &quot;It is very clear there is limited political space for Uighurs to express legitimate grievances and opposition to government policy.&quot; He argued that the recent surge in violence was reflected &quot;a long buildup of resentment and alienation from the Chinese state for many reasons&quot;. Crackdowns &quot;have been done before, and possibly will feed into radicalisation and more resentment, coupled with a state-led economic development strategy that is the cause of problems in the first place,&quot; Clarke said. Beijing has attempted to boost economic development in the region, hoping that raising incomes will calm tensions. But critics argue that the aggressive development model has increased friction owing to land grabs, growing inequality, increased Han migration and concerns that Uighurs have not truly benefited. &quot;There is greater discontent now and recognition that the Uighur character of the region is being irretrievably lost,&quot; Ahmed Hashim, a terrorism expert at Singapore&apos;s Nanyang Technical University, told Associated Press. China has also increased security measures across the country. State media said new measures in Urumqi included a regulation banning parking within 100 metres (328ft) of schools and increased security at shopping and entertainment centres. In Beijing, subway passengers now have to pass through scanners to enter several stations, while in Yunnan the public have been handed pamphlets on tackling terrorism. Major cities have already seen the introduction of armed police patrols in the wake of earlier terrorist attacks."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/27/north-korea-in-360-degrees-panoramic-views-of-pyongyang", "sentences": ["Singapore-based photographer Aram Pan is providing a new way of looking at North Korea through some spectacular panoramic images and videos of the country."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-27T07:54:50Z", "title": "North Korea in 360 degrees: panoramic views of Pyongyang", "tags": ["North Korea", "Photography", "Photography", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Singapore-based photographer Aram Pan is providing a new way of looking at North Korea through some spectacular panoramic images and videos of the country.

The data [pdf], which was drawn up by the British company Inmarsat, was released 80 days after the Boeing vanished with 239 people on board. It consists of a 47-page table of satellite logs from 4pm on 7 March when the plane took off from Kuala Lumpur until its last known contact of this type early the next day. Malaysia&apos;s civil aviation authority said the raw data was being released for &quot;public consumption&quot;. The data was used by Inmarsat to calculate that the Beijing-bound plane changed course and was likely to have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean. No trace of the plane has yet been found despite an extensive search in the area led by Australia, first on the surface by air and boat, and then underwater using specialist submarines. Explanatory notes to the newly released data point out that the ping signals were used to estimate the distance between the satellite and the aircraft, but that they do not pinpoint its exact location. Family members of the missing passengers have called for the data to be made public for independent analysis. They have criticised the Malaysian authorities for the way information about the search has been released and claimed they were wrong to give up hope by concluding that the plane went missing in the southern Indian Ocean. Last week in a report to the governments of Malaysia and Australia they said: &quot;There is no mention on why they are so sure the Inmarsat data is highly accurate and reliable.&quot; Inmarsat&apos;s interpretation of the data has been verified by the international investigation team, which includes Malaysia&apos;s Department for Civil Aviation, the US National Transport Safety Board, Britain&apos;s Air Accidents Investigations Branch, and China&apos;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Department. Analysts said it would take time to draw any conclusions from the new technical data. Shukor Yusof, an aviation analyst with Malaysia-based Endau Analytics, said the satellite data was &quot;highly technical&quot; and required an expert to decode. &quot;There are very few people who can make head or tail as to what the numbers indicate. To me as a layman, it looks like a sequence of signals that were given out by the aircraft possibly indicating its flight path,&quot; he said. Greg Waldron, Singapore-based managing editor with aviation publication group Flightglobal, said the satellite data was consistent with what Inmarsat had previously revealed. &quot;Basically it shows the timings of the handshakes of the plane with the satellite over the Indian Ocean,&quot; he said. &quot;But I would not dare to guess if they are searching in the right place. The fact that they are using this type of data shows how desperate the search for the plane is.&quot; Malaysia&apos;s civil aviation authority previously stressed that satellite data was just one of several elements being examined by investigators.

If anyone is a \u201cmaster of the universe\u201d, it is Justin, who never does tell me how much he earns, nor even how many digits his income runs to. I&apos;d hazard a guess at seven, maybe eight in a good year. \u201cI&apos;m underpaid for what I bring in to the bank,\u201d is all he&apos;ll say. My initial contact with him is a Saturday-morning phone call. I am just struggling into consciousness; Justin has been up for hours, sealing a deal in Africa. He says he gets to his office at 7am every day, and is often still there at midnight. The attraction of the City of London for financiers is that it spans time zones and acts as a bridge between the US and the rest of the world \u2013 hence the 17-hour day. The other seven hours can be left to Wall Street. Even investment bankers occasionally have to sleep. A few days after our initial phone conversation (when Justin warns me that \u201cwe see the Guardian as the enemy\u201d), we meet at a hotel in Mayfair, where he has been having lunch with clients. Mayfair, Canary Wharf and the old City, based around the Bank of England, are the three centres of London&apos;s financial world. Canary Wharf \u2013 modernist, faceless, towering \u2013 houses the mighty investment banks; the City \u2013 quirky, crowded, knotty, historic \u2013 has the brokers, insurers and ancillary services; Mayfair \u2013 discreet, stylish, cosmopolitan \u2013 is home to the hedge funds and private equity companies. I am trying to understand the culture of the City; to find out whether those who work there have learned the lessons of the crash of 2007-08, and if the City can ever be made \u201cdisaster proof\u201d \u2013 a question that has vexed politicians, financiers and the public ever since (indeed Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, has been warning the Hay Festival that another Fred Goodwin \u2013 the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss \u2013 will emerge unless the banking system changes). Seeking an insight into the City\u2019s problems is a thankless task. The terminology is baffling \u2013 I still can&apos;t distinguish between a credit default swap (CDS) and a collateralised debt obligation (CDO); organisations, including the Bank of England that refuses to grant me an interview, thrive on opacity; and City insiders are paranoid about talking to the media. I have never met so many people who insist on anonymity and demand to see quotes, or who, like Justin (not his real name), want both. He really must see me as the enemy, but to his credit he does talk \u2013 even if later he doubts whether he should have given the interview. \u201cThe City is the equivalent of Venice in the middle ages,\u201d Justin tells me. \u201cIt&apos;s a massive international melting pot that drives London and the rest of the country.\u201d He accepts there are bad guys, especially among the hedge funds, but insists the malign aspects of the City are outweighed by its benefits to the UK economy \u2013 providing more than 10% of the Treasury&apos;s total tax take. \u201cTo the aesthete Guardian, the average City trader looks pretty ugly because they drive swanky cars and are spivs,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut you should respect the mores and the facts.\u201d I promise to try.     The City of London is opaque to outsiders. Photograph: Martin Godwin    Justin startles me by extending his Venetian analogy. If the City is Venice, he says, then the rest of the UK is Mestre \u2013 the boring bit on the other side of the causeway that no one visits. \u201cThe banks are here [in the UK], but almost everything they do is not here,\u201d he says. \u201cI&apos;ve got no clients in this country. I&apos;ve got clients in Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Switzerland. That&apos;s very normal in the City. The City doesn&apos;t service London and the UK; it starts off in India and goes all the way to Ireland, then up to Russia and down to Cape Town.\u201d The City is not especially interested in the UK; it exists to serve \u2018Emea\u2019, a land known only to bankers: Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He doubts whether I will really grasp the City. \u201cOne of the problems for you is that the big banks are so massive. If I leave my desk and walk 10 yards, I have no idea what the people sitting there do. I&apos;m on one floor of a huge, multi-storey building, and each floor is the size of a football pitch.\u201d It sounds loathsome. Does he enjoy it? \u201cWith a bank you have to be in a competitive frame of mind. If you&apos;re good at it, you like it and you make money for yourself and the bank. You enjoy it and you like the buzz of money. If you&apos;re not good at it, you&apos;re unhappy, you don&apos;t make any money and eventually you get shot. I really hate it if I&apos;m not doing well. It&apos;s like a big competitive cocktail party where you have to be personable and outgoing and persuasive, but also you&apos;ve really got to think through the issues, understand the complex beast you&apos;re working for, and exploit all the various things it can do. Most of these banks can do anything.\u201d In a good way, he means. A few days after meeting Justin, I have dinner with three members of a City-based book club \u2013 a partner in one of the big four accountancy firms, a partner in a large City law firm, and a senior analyst at an investment bank. They are thoughtful, friendly, articulate; they don&apos;t share Justin&apos;s hang-ups about the Guardian; they accept there are many legitimate criticisms of the City \u2013 the accountant even recognises that the domination of the big four accountancy firms is a cartel; and they don&apos;t wash down the expensive meal (paid for by the accountant, thank goodness) with a ludicrously overpriced bottle of wine; in fact they don&apos;t drink any alcohol. Conclusion one: the image of the drink and drug-fuelled City may be overstated; these guys like good food, lively conversation \u2013 an antidote to the ritualised alternation of home and work, says one \u2013 and thought-provoking books. They are the antithesis of spivs. The analyst (all three have requested anonymity) rejects my assertion that the City is hermetically sealed from outsiders and almost deliberately opaque \u2013 my main conclusion by the time I meet them. With a comment that underlines the difficulty facing the newly launched Banking Standards Council (an independent body that will monitor the City\u2019s attempts to restore its reputation), he says, \u201cYou have to be careful when you refer to \u2018the City\u2019. It doesn&apos;t really exist. There are lots of different parts of the City that often work together, but it&apos;s a very long way from being homogeneous. They&apos;re all financial markets to some extent, and the City just happens to be the geography and the legislative regime that everybody operates in. \u201cIt&apos;s a lot less homogeneous than it used to be,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt&apos;s much more fragmented. There&apos;s no trade body, there&apos;s no single profession, the regulators have been fairly fragmented, and the client base is all different. I&apos;ve got hedge fund clients who are often managing money on behalf of very wealthy individuals. I&apos;ve got pension fund clients who are managing the retirement funds of shopfloor workers. The only thing that&apos;s homogeneous about it is that very little of it is consumer facing. It&apos;s all professional clients. There&apos;s a vague commitment to keeping London competitive as a financial centre, because that&apos;s in everyone&apos;s interest, but that&apos;s as close to esprit de corps as you get.\u201d   Hard Times interactive Interactive graphic: the divisive toll of the economic slump   The esprit de corps of the old bowler-hatted public-school City of the 1960s and 70s has gone. The US-born lawyer tells me that when he first came to the UK in the late 1980s, the City ran entirely on personal trust and had no regulation at all. \u201cIt shocked me coming from the US, where the securities markets [markets where assets such as stocks, bonds and futures are traded] had been regulated since the 1930s.\u201d He says deals were done with a handshake, and the lawyers drew up the contracts later. In the US it was always the other way round. That informality and sense of belonging to a club, in which the main sanction was the threat of being blackballed by your fellow members, largely disappeared with the restructuring (or rather destructuring) of the City that took place in 1986 \u2013 the so-called &quot;big bang&quot;, from which both London&apos;s dramatic rise as a global financial hub and the collapse of 2007-8 directly stem. The analyst says banks are now too big. \u201cMost banks are a series of silos,\u201d he says. \u201cThere&apos;s a fixed-income [government bonds] business, there&apos;s an equities [company shares] business, there&apos;s an advisory business, there&apos;s a fund management business, and they all operate with different regulators, different chinese walls, different operational requirements. In theory there&apos;s a synergy in having them all together, but in practice they&apos;re actually quite different institutions, and sometimes, in my more cynical moments, I think the only reason organisations get bigger is so the CEO can get paid more, because there&apos;s a strong correlation between the size of the organisation and how much money the CEO makes.\u201d He says that these multi-function banks, which have emerged since big bang, are impossibly complex. \u201cI look at our business and I think, how could one person understand a big, sophisticated international investment bank? It&apos;s almost impossible, particularly because the financial instruments have got a lot more complicated. With some of the financial instruments, you may be able to value them accurately today, but tomorrow it could be completely different. There are so many complicated things driving the valuation that no one can really understand what goes on, and the speed of trading makes it potentially very dangerous.\u201d In the age of high-frequency trading, where computers are increasingly making decisions with minimal human supervision, many insiders believe that, if there is another crash, the dominoes will fall even faster than last time. In 2008, chancellor Alistair Darling had 48 hours to make sure the ATMs didn&apos;t run out of cash. Next time the window may be a lot smaller (though optimists suggest it might be possible to program the computers to shut down if markets are in freefall). What is certain is that we are entering unknown territory, and that a future crash will take a different form from that of 2007-8.     The trading floor of the London Stock Exchange as the Big Bang reforms took effect in 1986. Photograph: PA    Big bang Justin and my dinner companions are denizens of the new City of London. This came into being on 27 October 1986, when the Thatcher government stripped away all the old rules and conventions governing financial life, in particular the brokers&apos; fixed commissions that had made it a closed shop, and heralded a revolution that became known as big bang. \u201cBig bang changed everything,\u201d says David Kynaston, author of a highly regarded four-volume history of the City. \u201cUntil then, the City was just the Square Mile, and in many ways it was a village.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England had almost papal powers and, it was said, could exert authority by arching an eyebrow. \u201cIt wasn&apos;t just that the financial centre was a physically much smaller place, which gave it a greater intimacy,\u201d says Kynaston. \u201cBusiness itself was conducted in a much more personal way, partly because institutions were smaller but also because markets were face to face. They became very impersonal with screen trading. There were also infinite personal connections. You had City families where one brother went off to a merchant bank and another brother went off to a discount house and another went to a stockbroking firm and so on. There was an intricate interconnected web of personal relationships.\u201d The upside \u2013 personal trading that bred the culture of \u201cmy word is my bond\u201d \u2013 had a downside: this really was a closed world of public school chaps who all knew each other, dined with each other, played golf or went shooting together, and earned a comfortable living because of the closed-shop practices that Margaret Thatcher, in the City as elsewhere, quite rightly set out to destroy. She ushered in a new, meritocratic world that is much more tolerant than the old City (where anti-semitism was endemic), but also made possible the takeover of the City by American banks in the 1980s and 90s, sweeping away most of the cautious old family-owned institutions and prepared the ground for the ultra-competitive anything-goes culture that produced the crash. In 2000 Philip Augar, a former high-flying City broker, wrote a book called The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, which chronicled the end of the old City. Even then, long before the great reckoning of 2007-8, he had an inkling of what was in store. \u201cOwnership brings control and it is the City&apos;s lack of control over its own destiny that creates concern,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are good reasons to believe that ownership matters and that the consequences will appear in due course.\u201d When I meet Augar, he tells me that after a 20-year career in the City, which straddled big bang, he started to worry about what he saw going on around him. \u201cDuring the 90s I started to get very unhappy about what was happening in the City, and one reason I left NatWest [where he was head of global equities and bonds] was that it was running a full-blooded trading, market-making business, and I felt that was risky. I didn&apos;t like the model and moved to Schroders [which then had an investment bank] because it was a different kind of firm \u2013 family dominated, been around a long time \u2013 and had a number of very happy years there. But I was getting less enamoured about what was going on in the City \u2013 the culture, the business model, how level we were with people \u2013 and I had the idea that I would write about it.\u201d The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, in some respects a lament for what had been lost, was the result. He says the book shocked people in the City. \u201cAt the time, the British-owned investment banks had blown up to the extent that they had sold themselves to foreign firms,\u201d he says. \u201cThe view at the time was, \u2018Hey, this is globalisation, that&apos;s what happens, and isn&apos;t it great.\u2019 But I took the view that it wasn&apos;t just about globalisation. There had been a lot of mismanagement in the City, and we needed to shine a light on that, and that&apos;s what the book tried to do. I also felt that no good would come of this. I felt that not having an indigenous investment banking industry would mean that the City would lose business. That bit was wrong. The bit that was right was that we would import the hard-charging American investment banking culture, which means conflict of interest, making money at the expense of everything and high leverage, by which I mean you borrow a huge amount of money to run your business.\u201d     Canary Wharf  (front) and the old City of London emerge from the fog. Photograph: Reuters/Metropolitan Police/MPS Helicopters    Augar&apos;s follow-up book, published just before the crash, was The Greed Merchants: How the Investment Banks Played the Free Market Game, which exposed the conflicts of interest at the heart of investment banks. \u201cI tried to explain how, by being able to act for the buyer and the seller in a deal, investment banks had an edge that gave them an advantage over every other market user. I saw that the culture was wrong and the business model was wrong, and that it was going to blow up somehow.\u201d He says that if he goes into investment banks or broking firms now, he realises he couldn&apos;t work in such an environment any more. \u201cI feel uncomfortable being in the City or Canary Wharf,\u201d he says, \u201cand overhearing conversations in coffee shops and wine bars.\u201d He finds \u201cthe certainty, the self-confidence, the reluctance to open up to alternative views\u201d depressing. \u201cThe view that you get is that there is just one way and ours is the right way. That view has started to soften around the edges, but hardcore City man and woman is still a very competitive alpha male/female focused on personal goals and some corporate goals. They still believe in the unfettered market economy, and I don&apos;t. I believe in the managed market, and that fundamental difference is why I had to stop.\u201d I wonder, given this philosophical divide from the culture of the City, how Augar coped in the two decades he spent at its heart. \u201cThe business model that was being run in the City then was fairly moderate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe conflicts of interest, the high leverage, the short-termism, those things weren&apos;t prevalent, and I felt for many years we were doing a good job for our customers, our shareholders and our staff and playing a responsible role in the economy at large. That started to change in the early 90s, and that was when I started to feel uneasy. I used to visit institutional shareholders with the then chief executive of NatWest, the late Derek Wanless, and I could see the pressure that they were putting him under. It felt wrong. It was all about results now, now, now, and if you fail to deliver we&apos;re going to shoot you, and eventually they did.\u201d He locates the start of the City&apos;s cultural transformation in the mid-90s. \u201cIt was the time when Morgan Stanley made a bid for SG Warburg [in 1994]. That started to tell you that the game was really beginning to change. The world that I&apos;d grown up in and was comfortable in was becoming something different.\u201d Big bang had triggered an even bigger bang. \u201cThe real watershed occurred in 1995,\u201d says Augar. \u201cIt was quite soon after the Barings debacle. Warburgs was forced into a merger, Kleinworts followed suit, Smith New Court sold themselves to Merrill Lynch. That opened the gates to the very highly leveraged, dangerous, risky model of trading, and after that everyone really went for it big time, all of which led to the banking crisis of 2007.\u201d Banks simply had too little capital to support the level of bad debts on their books, and without government bailouts many would have gone to the wall in 2007-8. Without a taxpayer-funded rescue, the bankers&apos; hubris would inevitably have been followed by nemesis. There&apos;s a great phrase that I hear again and again \u2013 \u201chaving your skin in the game\u201d. The old family-owned investment banks and stockbroking partnerships were dealing with their own money. The new conglomerates were not. The ecology of the old City made it much more small-scale and cautious. The post-big bang, post-consolidation City was expansionist and risk-taking, because the risks were being taken with someone else&apos;s money. Big bang ended the old nepotism, but introduced a form of financial despotism, when mega-banks \u2013 banks that in the end proved too be too big to fail \u2013 held the rest of society of ransom. In banking, small can be beautiful, but whether that old ecology can ever be recreated is highly doubtful. The global financial system is simply too interconnected. Putting &quot;moral hazard&quot; \u2013 the doctrine that says that if a bank makes a mistake, it pays for it \u2013 back into the system would be the single greatest step that could be taken in making the City more stable, but the Bank of England admits that we are still very far from achieving this. Banks are still too big to fail, and if there was another crash tomorrow the government would again have to step in to save the system from collapse. These days, the only skin in the game is the taxpayers&apos;.           Video analysis by Phillip Inman: the financial crisis, five years on    Evading responsibility  Meeting Kynaston and Augar was crucial to my understanding that, in a way, we were all responsible for the crash. We \u2013 the public, journalists, politicians \u2013 let it happen because we didn&apos;t challenge the City, didn&apos;t try to understand it. New Labour thought it had discovered a magic money-tree and gave up on regulation; journalists on the whole failed to read the runes or question the new macho expansionist, masters-of-the-universe culture; the public liked the easy credit and soaring house prices and was too lazy to examine what was happening in the City; and what naysayers and doom-mongers there were tended to be marginalised. Much of this remains true even today. Who understands the implications of George Osborne&apos;s great pensions reform, and who is bothering to find out what it means? Is the alleged collusion in foreign exchange trading getting the play it deserves? Do we understand the recent shake-up of personnel at the Bank of England, which saw the installation of a new head of financial stability?  The Financial Conduct Authority has been much in the news because of the bungled announcement of an investigation into pensions and other investments, but do you really understand where they fit into the complicated web of financial supervision that has been constructed in the wake of the crash? It&apos;s complicated, technical and needs a long-term commitment to telling the story. Most of the time we can&apos;t be bothered, even though the way the City behaves and regulates itself affects the lives of every one of us. \u201cThe City has always managed to evade its responsibilities because people find finance incomprehensible and boring,\u201d says Kynaston, \u201cand the City itself didn&apos;t do much to change that. In the 1870s, following the scandals that prompted Trollope to write The Way We Live Now, the Royal Commission on the Stock Exchange recommended that a viewing gallery be erected so that people could go and see what was happening in this place. The commission reported in 1878; the viewing gallery was erected 75 years later, in 1953.\u201d I approached the present-day stock exchange \u2013 now just a central supervisory office next to St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, as trading is done remotely from banks&apos; trading floors \u2013 for an interview and to observe the official start of trading at 8am (a visiting dignitary is sometimes allowed to sound the bell that declares trading open). The press office team were very friendly and sent me a very nice video of the Dominican ambassador opening trading in June last year, but I am still waiting for the interview. I was told I would receive a call to set up a visit and an interview with one of the executives. Three weeks later, I&apos;m still waiting. This remains a world fundamentally opposed to viewing galleries. A group of young activists inspired by the Occupy movement now do tours of the Square Mile, Canary Wharf and Mayfair. I joined the Mayfair tour one Sunday afternoon, and for two and a half hours we strolled around looking at the offices of all the hedge funds and investment companies in the area. What was most striking was that not a single one had a nameplate on the elegant building that housed them. They didn&apos;t want anyone to know they were there. There were about 20 people on the tour, which has to be booked online, and I got talking to a woman in her 20s. It&apos;s ridiculous, she told me, that finance isn&apos;t an integral part of the curriculum \u2013 both personal finance and the big-picture stuff about the City. She is of course right. How are we supposed to make decisions about our own finances \u2013 should I cash in my pension pot and buy that Lamborghini? \u2013 or even try to understand the City without a basic grounding? The Square Mile is run by the City of London Corporation, which traces its lineage back almost 1,000 years and prides itself on being like no other local authority. The Occupy activists see them as secretive and insular, as part of the problem. I found them efficient and eager to help, though I accept Occupy&apos;s point that they lack the democratic accountability of an ordinary local authority. The electorate is small \u2013 the 9,000 residents of the City and senior figures in the businesses that operate there; the electoral structure of wards, councillors, aldermen, sheriffs and, at the top, the lord mayor labyrinthine. The Occupy activists have a good deal of fun with the &quot;Remembrancer&quot;, a legal official from the corporation who represents the City&apos;s interests in the House of Commons and gets to sit behind the speaker&apos;s chair \u2013 a prime example, according to Occupy, of the overly close embrace of politics and big business. Canary Wharf, a private estate with a private security force, is even more of a closed world. It feels as if it could be anywhere in the world \u2013 Dubai, Singapore, Shanghai. Both the old City and the new are self-governing islands of wealth: not only not part of the UK but barely part of London. The fact that the Corporation of London has its own 800-strong police force, separate from the Met, emphasises that this is a world entire unto itself. The Square Mile grew up within London&apos;s old Roman wall, and that wall has become symbolic of its otherness and defensiveness. Most City buildings may be made of glass these days, but they are still far from transparent.     The City of London is a world unto itself. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Macho culture The Dutch writer Joris Luyendijk spent two years from 2011 to 2013 writing a blog for the Guardian about the City of London, and next spring will publish a book encapsulating his thoughts about this strange, secretive, self-contained world. The fact that he is an anthropologist by background has helped him delineate its tribes and rituals, and when we meet \u2013 in his favourite Turkish restaurant in north London \u2013 he tells me he has reached a counterintuitive conclusion about the inhabitants of the City. They are not masters of the universe, he insists; they are victims \u2013 clocking up 100 hours a week, working in an ultra-competitive environment, getting kicked out with just a few minutes to toss their possessions into a cardboard box if they can&apos;t hack it. \u201cHow they survive is by self-delusion,\u201d he argues. \u201cThey completely deny and ignore their own vulnerability.\u201d The City, he points out, is full of psychotherapists giving help to troubled financiers. \u201cThe bankers are the best-paid victims of a system that turns all of us into victims. The whole culture of always squeezing more growth and wealth out of something makes for a very totalitarian system where everybody&apos;s constantly after success.\u201d Luyendijk sees Canary Wharf as the empty heart of City life \u2013 towering offices, glitzy shops and a setting that (except for the dreary London weather) could be anywhere in the world. \u201cIt&apos;s the crassest illustration of the human condition in the 21st century,\u201d he says. He calls the working life of people in the City \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and says there is no evidence it has changed since the crash. \u201cThere is ripping off, where you lie to your clients. There is market rigging, where you lie to the central administration of Libor or forex. Then there is risking, where you lie to yourself about the risks you are taking or lie to your superior and then the regulator. And then there&apos;s rogue trading, where somebody hides their losses for a long time.\u201d Some banks are more predatory than others, but the prevailing culture remains short-termist. \u201cAs long as you can be out of the door in five minutes,\u201d he says, \u201cyour horizon is five minutes.\u201d A Dutchman like Luyendijk is horrified by such a culture. Dutch society is founded on social-democrat and Christian-democrat principles \u2013 long-term relationships based on trust rather than control \u2013 whereas the City now runs on anglo-American neoliberal rules of zero job security and control rather than trust. \u201cThe City of London is a little pocket of Hobbesian jungle,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don&apos;t think that&apos;s tenable in the long run.\u201d Luyendijk&apos;s critique is powerful, though it is rejected by most of those who work in the City. They accept the high-risk, high-reward structure, and say no one is forcing them to work there. But burn-out rates are undoubtedly high. In quitting after 20 years, Augar is by no means untypical. This is a world of ambitious young people on the make, and by the age of 50, especially on trading floors, you are ancient in City terms. Savvas Savouri, who has worked in the City for more than 20 years and is now a partner in a hedge fund that manages assets worth \u00a32.5bn, says the value placed on youth in the City is misguided. He also argues that the fact that many of the people entering the City have no financial qualifications \u2013 he speaks as someone who has an economics PhD and was an economics lecturer in the 1980s \u2013 is insane.  \u201cThe first thing you should ask anybody in this industry \u2013 very carefully, because they can get rubbed up the wrong way \u2013 is, \u2018Do you mind giving me your background?\u2019 Their instinct is to tell you where they&apos;ve worked, but you say, \u2018No, no, your education.\u2019 You&apos;ll be frightened by what you&apos;ll hear. You&apos;ll have professionals that have degrees in the humanities and the arts, and most recently engineers and physicists. I&apos;m not suggesting that those aren&apos;t laudable subjects, but they don&apos;t have an application in this industry. It&apos;s like asking someone who&apos;s trained as a mechanic to become a surgeon.\u201d In the course of a long conversation, in which he dismisses the veneration of the pre-big bang City as \u201cnostalgic crap\u201d, he keeps returning to this theme that the standard of people entering to the City has to be improved. \u201cWe are in the same state of development as medicine was before it was formalised,and you had to go and do a medical degree. In the old days, your dentist or your barber or your butcher was also your surgeon. We&apos;re still in that in finance, and that&apos;s why 2007-8 happened. Rather than regulate bonuses, regulate and manage the human capital that comes into it.\u201d     The City of London. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Russell Taylor has spent the past 25 years chronicling the ups and downs of City life through his cartoon character Alex, which started in 1987 in the London Daily News, migrated to the Independent when the LDN closed and currently trades in the Telegraph. He says he and cartoonist Charles Peattie concocted an archetypal monstrous, money-obsessed yuppie from their imaginations, and then, as they got to know the City better. were shocked to discover he really existed. \u201cI remember once talking to someone in the City about Alex and saying, \u2018Well, he&apos;s just a prat, isn&apos;t he?\u2019, and he said, \u2018But he&apos;s my hero, my role model.\u2019\u201d Taylor&apos;s view is that many of those who went into the City in the 70s and 80s drifted into the City, but that the new intake are totally committed. \u201cThe Alex generation [of the 1980s and 90s] has cleared the way for them morally by saying it&apos;s OK to be shallow. It&apos;s OK just to want money. You don&apos;t have to pretend that you want to save the world or write a protest song.\u201d Many observers believe that getting more women into the City, especially at board level, might help to curb the macho culture. There are a healthy percentage of women in law and human resources, but very few in trading or in the upper echelons of banking management. The analyst I met at dinner told me he had recently attended a meeting of almost 50 executives at his bank, only one of which was female \u2013 and even she had just returned from maternity leave. This remains a man&apos;s world, especially at the sharp end. At a breakfast discussion of women in the London economy at the office of the Centre for London thinktank, there is general agreement that anti-social hours and the culture of presenteeism in the City are barriers to women. There is a further problem, Diane Perrons, professor of gender studies at the London School of Economics, tells me after the discussion. \u201cWithin an organisation it&apos;s often very unclear what the progression structures are. Many of the mechanisms for promotion or pay increases are very opaque. What tends to happen is that people make judgements about other people&apos;s qualities in terms of leadership, dynamism, competitiveness, drive and so on, and they tend to be based on what one can think of as a kind of reciprocal recognition among peers. Other kinds of skills that may be important, more competitive, collaborative skills, are not really appreciated.\u201d They are the very skills, she says, that women are likely to have, but all too often they are ignored by male executives who tend to promote in their own image. Perrons describes research she did at a bank that said it wanted to change its working practices to encourage women, but found it very hard to do so. \u201cPeople at the lower levels of the organisation took advantage of leave schemes,\u201d she says, \u201cbut people higher up did not because of what were seen to be the negative effects of how they would be understood by the organisation.\u201d She says she had found no evidence that women were breaking into trading and other traditional male areas. Women do have one significant champion in the City \u2013 the Lord mayor, Fiona Woolf, only the second woman in more than 900 years to occupy that position. I meet her at the Mansion House, the lord mayor&apos;s residence close to the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England in the heart of the old City. Woolf is an energy lawyer, an area of relative female strength, but she recognises there are other areas where women are finding it hard to break in. \u201cThere are curious pockets where women are absent, like in asset management,\u201d she says. \u201cEven the law still has a long way to go. It has a long-hours culture, and measures success by the number of hours charged rather than the quality and efficiency of the output.\u201d \u201cWe want a much more diverse working culture, and we haven&apos;t got there yet,\u201d admits the accountant with whom I have dinner. \u201cPersonally, I think we should have quotas, and we should start at every promotion stage and fill them half male and half female. We have 50% male and 50% female at graduate level, but by the time you get up to senior management level we&apos;re 70:30. That&apos;s because we don&apos;t try to create the working environment that accommodates being a working mother.\u201d But getting more women in the City is unlikely to be a panacea. \u201cThe chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers was a woman,\u201d the lawyer points out drily. The analyst is also sceptical that more women in the City would have averted the crash, arguing that the problem is not too few women at the top, but too many traders. \u201cNever let a trader run a bank,\u201d he says emphatically. Traders are instinctive gamblers, and, as the crash showed, when banks place huge bets the most likely losers are the rest of us.     Bank bailouts compared. Click for a larger image. Graphic: Paul Scruton    After the crash Has anything really changed since the crash of 2007-8? That&apos;s the trillion-dollar question. Have lessons been learned in the City? Can the culture truly be said to have changed? Can we trust the new system of regulation? Some insiders argue that there are encouraging signs of a cultural shift, but plenty of others are sceptical. My most worrying encounter is with a derivatives trader who trades interest rate futures. He insists behaviour is as bad as ever, supervision as lax and, with increasingly high-frequency trading, the market even more unstable than it was in 2007-8.  \u201cThere is no morality in the City,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere is no justice, no law, it&apos;s ruled by Billy the Quid, it&apos;s a free-for-all. There are fewer colourful bankers hanging out in chatrooms calling themselves &apos;the Cartel&apos; these days. Now it&apos;s mathematicians and computer scientists programming algorithms from the Czech Republic. The Financial Conduct Authority no longer have any control over these foreign-based hedge funds.\u201d The trader says misbehaviour is endemic. \u201cIf you&apos;re in an environment where misbehaviour is taking place, it&apos;s accepted. For example, with Libor if you were there you would have to have done it. If you didn&apos;t do it, they [your employer] would have said &apos;What&apos;s your fucking problem? Out.&apos; You&apos;d have been fired. There is an ongoing manipulation of interest rate futures on a scale much larger than Libor. We all know it&apos;s going on, we see it every day, we&apos;ve reported it and it&apos;s been brushed under the carpet.\u201d He claims algorithms and trading from overseas make rigging easier, the regulators are weak, and the exchanges are primarily interested in the volume of trading. The picture he paints is nightmarish. Luyendijk is convinced that the steps taken so far in terms of regulation and reining in bonuses are a charade. He argues that both banking and politics are run by mutually supportive cartels, and that the status quo is inherently unstable. I ask him for his prescription. He replies with a counter-question. \u201cCan you have global finance without global government? And if you don&apos;t want global government, what do you do about global finance?\u201d He says the banks are so large and powerful that they have co-opted politicians and academics, and despite the shock to the system in 2007-8 have now reverted to global business as usual. \u201cThe way the economics profession have washed their hands of all this is quite astonishing,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the global issue I don&apos;t have a solution. I really don&apos;t know whether you can have global finance without global government, and I don&apos;t want global government. But various steps [worth taking] would be that credit rating agencies should not be paid by the banks they rate, and accountancy firms should not make lots of money through consultancy to banks whose books they audit. It&apos;s deeply incestuous.\u201d Savouri says the conflicts and overlaps will get worse, as accountancy and legal firms, eyeing the investment banks&apos; fat fees in merger deals, start to develop banking arms of their own. He may not be nostalgic for the ordered pre-big bang City, but he doesn&apos;t seem too enamoured of the chaotic of the one that has emerged since, though he does say that, with so much misinformation and mismanagement, a hedge fund which knows what it&apos;s doing and can sort through the rubbish can find that edge which everyone in the City is pursuing. Luyendijk rejects the whole system \u2013 a tempting, if impractical, position. Lobby group CityUK \u2013 another organisation that was reluctant to grant me an interview \u2013 likes to point out that financial services account for 8% of UK GDP and almost 12% of tax revenues. It also claims almost 2 million people work in finance and associated professional services, though that figure is largely meaningless as it will include large numbers of lowly paid workers in high street banks \u2013 not really part of the City by any proper definition. Justin sees high street banks as corner-shop operations compared with the investment banking titans. A more relevant figure might be that the old City and Canary Wharf each has around 45,000 fully fledged bankers. But even allowing for CityUK&apos;s inflation of the real figures, this is not a sector that can be dismantled without taking the UK economy down with it. Reform and some degree of disaster-proofing seem the only answer. My three dinner companions are, however, doubtful whether that can be achieved. \u201cYou always solve the problems that you don&apos;t have any more when you try to do these things,\u201d says the lawyer. \u201cWe&apos;re just bolting the stable after the horse has gone,\u201d says the analyst. \u201cGreater regulation won&apos;t future-proof the industry. It just pushes up the cost of doing business.\u201d So what should have happened, I ask him? \u201cWe should have sent more people to jail. Not enough senior people were put to the sword.\u201d \u201cAnd more banks should have been allowed to go bust,\u201d chimes in the accountant. \u201cI&apos;d have let them all go, personally.\u201d Andrew Hilton, the affable director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, takes a similar line, arguing that moral hazard is the only way to ensure the operation of a free market. Hilton says the answer is to have less regulation rather than more, and to let the failures go to the wall. \u201cBig banks like regulation,\u201d he explains. \u201cRegulation is a fixed cost, so the bigger you are, the more clout you have to amortise [spread] it over. It favours the big over the small, and is another row of bricks in the wall that keeps competition out. You may complain like hell about it, but in the end you like it because it preserves your oligopolistic position. There isn&apos;t a single regulator in the world who has ever advanced his or her career by letting a bank go broke, so the answer to every problem for a regulator is a regulation, like a carpenter and a nail. So you have an ineluctable tendency for regulators to regulate more and more, and for banks to get bigger and bigger. We&apos;re in a cul de sac, and heading for gridlock in the financial system.\u201d Hilton welcomes the growth of hedge funds and what he calls the \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector because the institutions are smaller, more flexible, less closely regulated and can be allowed to go under. \u201cThey may be very loathsome people,\u201d he says, \u201cand I&apos;d want to count my fingers after I&apos;d shaken hands with some of them, but the model is good because these guys have their own money at risk and they&apos;re not too big too fail.\u201d Hilton hopes this shadow banking sector will grow \u2013 though not so much that the institutions in it start to pose their own systemic risk \u2013 and also believes peer-to-peer lending will expand, with internet marketplaces matching entrepreneurs and private investors. Everyone, except Justin the investment banker who blames two uppity Scottish banks, recognises that, in the years leading up to 2007-8, thinking in the City was suicidally short-termist. \u201cThere was so much emphasis on what you delivered this year,\u201d says one City insider. \u201cI can remember times when bosses in banks and hedge funds would turn around and say, \u2018You&apos;re just not performing well enough this year. If you&apos;re not performing by the end of the year, you&apos;re fired.\u2019 Some guy would come through and make a load of money and he&apos;d be hailed as the new star trader, but it was just that he was on the right side of whatever wave was striking the markets that year. I&apos;ve seen a number of people do really well one year and then do terribly the next year, but because of the asymmetric nature of the bonuses you might get a million euros one year and nothing the next, but you&apos;ve still got 500,000 euros a year.\u201d James Barty, strategy director at the British Bankers&apos; Association, insists the City is now being more rational about remuneration. \u201cSalaries have gone up, and bonuses [the analyst at dinner insisted on calling them \u2018variable pay\u2019] have been deferred.\u201d You can take some of the bonus, but the rest is kept back in case you perform poorly in subsequent years. If you &quot;blow up&quot;, to use the argot of the City, your anticipated bonus will not be paid, or it will be much reduced. In theory, it reduces risk-taking, makes traders take a more long-term view, and is also a way of ensuring loyalty among staff. \u201cIt changes behaviour,\u201d says Barty. \u201cIf you say, \u2018I got a really good bonus last year, but I&apos;m either going to get zero or possibly get fired this year if I don&apos;t make enough money,\u2019 you&apos;re incentivised to roll the dice because you&apos;ll think, \u2018If I lose \u20ac5m I&apos;ll get fired and if I lose \u20ac10m I&apos;ll get fired.\u2019 But if you say to somebody, \u2018OK, you made \u20ac20m last year, you&apos;re down \u20ac5m this year, we&apos;re going to claw back a little bit of your bonus but if you go to down \u20ac20m we&apos;re going to claw back everything,\u2019 it changes people&apos;s behaviour, and that&apos;s a very healthy thing to happen.\u201d     A worker walks away from the Canary Wharf office of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 when the 158-year-old Wall Street firm sought bankruptcy protection. Photograph: Andrew Winning/Reuters    Regulatory failures The other key contributor to the crash was the failure of the new system of regulation set up by the Labour government. \u201cThe regulators didn&apos;t do their job properly,\u201d says one former hedge fund manager. \u201cThe Bank of England got away with murder, Mervyn King [the then governor] in particular. There is some evidence that the Bank of England saw some of the problems coming, but if it saw some of the problems coming why did it not say to RBS when it was going to buy ABN Amro [the Dutch bank which helped bring RBS down], \u2018You are our biggest bank, we&apos;re worried about the stability of the financial system, we cannot allow you to take an acquisition like this, which is going to leverage you up so much that you will put the UK economy at risk\u2019? \u201cA whole bunch of us in the City in 2007 were saying, \u2018Why is RBS still trying to buy ABN Amro?\u2019 because everyone knew that ABN Amro was probably the worst and most leveraged bank in Europe, with lots of horrible stuff on its balance sheet. RBS should either not have been allowed to buy it, or the regulators should have insisted they raise equity to buy it. They were allowed to fund the acquisition with debt, which is why RBS had so little equity to absorb the losses. That should never have been allowed to happen.\u201d The Financial Services Authority carried the can for the regulatory failures, and has now been replaced by two regulators (which are costing \u00a3128m a year more to run than the FSA, according to recent figures). The Prudential Regulation Authority, which operates under the Bank of England&apos;s umbrella, is responsible for the financial health of the banks, building societies, insurers and investment companies. The Financial Conduct Authority concentrates on the way they behave and how they treat their customers. Critics of the quality of regulators say they have difficulty dealing on equal terms with highly paid City professionals. There is also a risk that staff, who tend to earn a lot less than the people they are supposed to be regulating, will be poached, especially at a time when in-house compliance officers are multiplying. This need to show they can compete on level terms may be why the FCA&apos;s office in Canary Wharf is so imposing. The reception area is vast, and the scanners and TVs make it feel like an airport. The reception staff are efficient and keep calling me by my first name. There is a sense that the new organisation is trying very hard. I am here to meet Clive Adamson, the FCA&apos;s director of supervision. Like many at the FCA, he used to work at the FSA, but that was then. This is year zero in bank regulation terms \u2013 a fresh beginning. \u201cA real breakdown in trust has occurred,\u201d he says, \u201cand we have to restore that trust.\u201d He accepts the regulators were, as the cliche has it, \u2018&quot;asleep at the wheel&quot;. \u201cThere was so much froth in the financial system that we didn&apos;t spot where the froth was leading too. Financial engineering, over-leverage, a lack of capital in the system, no real liquidity, banks taking on too much risk. While everything looked good, it looked good, and nobody really spotted the elephant in the room. In the UK it was unclear who was really responsible [for the well-being of the system], the central bank or the regulator, and because the regulator was too over-stretched and had too broad a remit, it was insufficiently focused on those issues.\u201d Can we now be confident the regulator is awake at the wheel and knows an elephant when it lumbers into the boardroom? \u201cThere have been several key changes,\u201d says Adamson. \u201cThe regulator has been split into two. The PRA looks at individual firms&apos; financial robustness and works out if they fail, how would they fail? The Bank of England&apos;s financial policy committee looks at the system as a whole. And the FCA has a very clear remit about consumer protection, market integrity and competition, which is all about making markets work well for the benefit of consumers. By splitting it in that way, we can be much more focused. \u201cThe other key thing that&apos;s changed is that we now put the interests of the consumer at the heart of what we do. Historically, we focused more on firms, but now we are focused on the consumer. Thirdly, we&apos;ve changed culturally. We are much more forward-looking and pre-emptive now, and want to act quicker when we see things. We don&apos;t always want to be fighting the last battle. Conduct regulation tends to be very reactive, dealing with things when they&apos;ve happened and trying to clear the mess up, as opposed to asking what the next mess is going to be and trying to stop it before it happens. That in essence is what we are now trying to do, and it&apos;s very difficult.\u201d The light-touch regulation beloved of the Blair-Brown governments has now been abandoned, but Andrew Hilton at the CSFI will be pleased to hear that Adamson is wary of going too far. \u201cIt&apos;s a real issue how to get the balance right,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecause what we don&apos;t want to do is to be so intrusive that we stop markets developing. That&apos;s partly why we have a competition objective \u2013 to make markets work better.\u201d He says the stability of the financial system can never be guaranteed. \u201cYou can&apos;t disaster-proof. What we can do is reduce the risk of something going wrong. We can&apos;t eliminate the risk. And if we did try to eliminate the risk with ever tougher regulation, by for example prudentially demanding more and more capital and from a conduct perspective being much more prescriptive on products, the costs would be too high.\u201d I ask Adamson whether he believes the culture in the City has changed since the crash. \u201cI think it&apos;s changing,\u201d he says after a moment&apos;s hesitation. \u201cThat&apos;s the biggest issue of all \u2013 to change both the corporate culture and individual attitudes. In our experience when bad things have happened, whether it&apos;s financial problems or big conduct issues like PPI [payment protection insurance], in virtually all cases there&apos;s an aspect of the culture in the firm that&apos;s wrong. Either the incentive system is wrong, or the people at the top didn&apos;t know what was happening. So we think very strongly that in order for less bad things to happen in the future, the culture and behaviour in the firms have to support doing the right thing, and that&apos;s difficult to change.\u201d     Workers in the Canary Wharf business district. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters    Towards an ethical City In 2010, the lobby group CityUK brought together 21 young professionals from banking, asset management, accountancy, insurance and the law to write a manifesto for the future of the City. Called Next Generation Vision, its conclusions were eminently sensible. Its mantra was that financial services should be \u201ca part of society, not apart from society\u201d \u2013 Venice needed to engage with Mestre.  The document produced by the 21 called for \u201ca standardised, formalised moral code to encompass the industry as a whole\u201d; \u201cremuneration based on the long-term value created\u201d; greater transparency and accountability in an effort to regain trust; and \u201can independently audited annual report assessing the wide-ranging aspects of the contribution of our industry to society\u201d. It also called for industry to \u201cwork with the appropriate education experts and bodies to establish an enhanced programme of lifelong financial education and assistance, embedded into our school curriculum and beyond\u201d. All laudable aims that, if acted on, could transform the relationship of the City and wider society, which at the moment, if it can be said to exist at all, is a combustible mixture of incomprehension, envy and loathing. I have breakfast with Alan Mak, a 30-year-old corporate lawyer turned private investor who was one of the co-authors of the Next Generation Vision, and ask him why he got involved. \u201cIt&apos;s about generation Y, the next generation of leaders in the City, setting out a vision for what they think it should be like in 10 to 15 years,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt&apos;s not a minute blueprint of everything that should happen; it&apos;s more a vision of how things should be: an ethical marketplace that is tied to society; a sector that should be successful but should also help businesses, communities and families.\u201d Mak&apos;s background has shaped his proselytising mission. His parents were Hong Kong Chinese who came to the UK in the 1960s, and he grew up in Yorkshire. They were poor but very ambitious for their son, who studied law at Cambridge and joined a big City law firm, which nominated him for the Next Generation Vision project. He is also a Christian, and the combination of his religion and the deprivation he experienced as a child gives him a strong moralising mission. \u201cThe City has to be successful \u2013 it employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides the finance for hundreds of thousands of businesses, and keeps food on the table for hundreds of thousands of families \u2013 but those who are successful in it have a duty to use that success to benefit others. There was a sense in the crash that certain parts of the sector had become detached from wider society.\u201d He also emphasises that the City is unique among industries in that it is systemic. It has the power to take every other business down with it, so unethical activity in the City poses society-wide dangers. In a lecture at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to mark the publication of his biography of the great financier Siegmund Warburg in 2010, the historian Niall Ferguson spelt out the need for an ethical reawakening in the City. \u201cThe real lesson of history is that regulation alone is not the key to financial stability,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, over-complicated regulation can be the disease it purports to cure, by encouraging a culture of box-ticking \u2018compliance\u2019 rather than individual moral judgment ... What is more important is to instil in financial professionals the kind of ethical framework that was the basis of Siegmund Warburg&apos;s life and work. \u2018Success from the financial and from the prestige point of view is not enough,\u2019 Warburg told his fellow directors in 1959. \u2018What matters even more is constructive achievement and adherence to high moral and aesthetic standards in the way in which we do our work.\u2019\u201d Warburg, the king of the old City, died in 1982, just as the new anything-goes culture was about to destroy it. Take a short walk down Cheapside from the Bank of England and you come to St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. In the City, God and mammon are intimately connected. On virtually every street corner, there&apos;s a gorgeous church designed by Christopher Wren to fill the gaps after the great fire of 1666, which destroyed the medieval city. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein once claimed he and his fellow bankers were \u201cdoing God&apos;s work\u201d, and, judging by the way banks and churches sit cheek by jowl, the City seems to take the same view. St Paul&apos;s has its own chinese wall, with contentious political and economic issues dealt with by the St Paul&apos;s Institute, which, according to its website, exists \u201cto engage the financial world with questions of morality and ethics\u201d. Until 2011 it was run by Canon Giles Fraser (now a parish priest in south London and a Guardian columnist), but he resigned in October of that year because he disagreed with the cathedral&apos;s decision to evict the Occupy protesters camped all round the great church. \u201cI would have wanted to negotiate down the size of the camp and to have appealed to people to help us keep the cathedral going,\u201d Fraser said at the time, \u201cand if that meant that I was thereby granting them some legal right to stay then that is the position that I would have to wear.\u201d     Occupy London demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral in 2011. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Since Fraser&apos;s resignation, the institute has been overseen by Peter Selby, the former bishop of Worcester and author of Grace and Mortgage: The Language of Faith and the Debt of the World, though a new full-time director will be appointed later this year. Selby is a thoughtful, articulate 72-year-old with a wonderfully sonorous episcopal voice, and all through our conversation at the cathedral, I feel he wants to be more radical in his prescriptions for remaking the City than the institute&apos;s rules of engagement allow him to be. Selby tells me the institute surveyed financial professionals in the City, and that he was struck by the apparently contradictory findings the survey threw up. \u201cIt goes to the heart of many of the questions you are raising,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo thirds of the people that were surveyed said financial-sector professionals were overpaid, and two thirds of them also said they were in it for the money. If you draw a Venn diagram, you can see that there are a significant number of people who are in it for the money and feel the profession is overpaid, which I think is the kind of conscientious difficulty that the church ought to be sticking a crowbar into and prising open.\u201d The conflicted nature of the respondents to the survey may be another aspect of the self-delusion that Luyendijk pinpoints as a feature of City life. The bishop highlights another feature of the survey. \u201cMore than half of them said the big bang had contributed to a decline in ethical standards. Given the almost universal acceptance at the time of the necessity of deregulation, that&apos;s also an intriguing area in which we need to insert ourselves. How can a huge community of people say that the work [they do] is absolutely necessary and wrong?\u201d So what needs to change? \u201cThe prescriptions are very hotly debated,\u201d says Selby, \u201cand most of them in my view don&apos;t go to the heart of the matter. The real question is how far the City is connected with and deeply committed to the real economy of people&apos;s actual work. The difference between the virtual and the real economy is another crucial area in which we need to work. The virtual economy is entirely about numbers and money, and that&apos;s what led us to the abyss.\u201d I ask him how Jesus would have dealt with the City. I don&apos;t get a direct response to this question, but there&apos;s not much doubt Selby would want to take a hard line with the moneylenders. \u201cWe have to say to certain people, \u2018What you just said doesn&apos;t tally with what you just did. And this is not being said to you because we want to condemn you personally. It&apos;s the system that is leading you into these contradictions.\u2019\u201d A few days before coming to St Paul&apos;s, I had met a leading figure from a Christian charity who recalled having lunch with a banker friend high up in the executive dining room of a City office. \u201cWe are buying that company tomorrow,\u201d the banker had told him, pointing to a building far below, \u201cand most of the staff will have to be sacked.\u201d \u201cThat&apos;s terrible,\u201d the man from the charity said to his friend. \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d \u201cIt&apos;s the will of the bank,\u201d said the banker. The charity man told me he had tried to unpick what that phrase meant, and had found it impossible to discover who had made the decision. The bank had become an impersonal entity, almost literally with a will of its own. The story and the phrase had stayed with me, and I put it to Selby that this was crucial to the dehumanised way in which the City tended to operate. He cites Vince Cable&apos;s recent criticism of the bankers for saying they feel they have to earn multimillion-pound salaries because all their peers in other banks do \u2013 a feeble reason, Selby (and indeed Cable) thinks. Selby&apos;s colleague, Canon Mark Oakley, who has overall responsibility for the institute and has joined our meeting, makes a wider point: \u201cThat picture you describe says so much about the anger of a lot of people. Money represents a huge source of power that is seemingly out of democratic control, and that gets us nervous. But if something is out of democratic control in a democracy, it&apos;s a political problem.\u201d \u201cIt&apos;s worse than that,\u201d adds Selby. \u201cIt&apos;s not only out of control. It&apos;s in control of the things it should be being controlled by.\u201d Oakley is right: only the politicians can really get to grips with the City and decide what part it should play in our national life. But do they have the will to do so? The Vickers and Tyrie commissions, set up in the wake of the crash to look at both the way banks operated and the culture within them, have made a series of sensible suggestions \u2013 dividing investment banking from retail banking; making bank executives personally responsible for scandals such as Libor; deferring bonuses; protecting whistleblowers \u2013 but there has no fundamental questioning of the role of the City in our lives, and we are now more or less back to business as usual. As David Kynaston points out, the City scandals of the 1870s produced a royal commission; why wasn&apos;t there one this time? Many of the people who work there deny it, but the City does feel like a separate, self-contained world, protecting its age-old rights, wary of intruders. The Occupy activists told me that, when I visited the Mansion House to meet the lord mayor, I should look at the stained-glass window in the dining room where the chancellor makes his annual speech. It shows Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasant&apos;s Revolt in 1381, being slain by the then lord mayor, William Walworth. One doesn&apos;t necessarily want to take sides in that 600-year-old battle between property and privilege, but I did wonder if replacing it might be one symbolic way for the City to mark a fresh beginning in its relationship with the peasants who exist outside its gilded world. \u2022 Stephen Moss on why Russians are obsessed with London"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/27/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week", "sentences": ["Seriously: next time you\u2019re passing through Singapore, Bangkok or Jakarta have a look in the airport bookshop."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-27T12:11:27Z", "title": "Tips, links and suggestions: What are you reading this week?", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Fiction", "Robert Harris"], "article": "Welcome to this week&apos;s blog.

She uses this framework to explores larger ideas about stories, selfhood, memory and myth. I really liked her thoughts on reading and the relationship between reader, book and writer:   The object we call a book is not the real book, but its potential, like a musical score or seed. It exists fully only in the act of being read; and its real home is inside the head of the reader, where the symphony resounds, the seed germinates. A book is a heart that only beats in the chest of another.

In the best tradition of essay writing, it&apos;s not just about its apparent subject matter, but something bigger. About the attached memories, about the guilt she feels about getting rid of them but the oppressive hold they have over her because of their sheer bulk, the way they attract and trap dust, the way they decay. The way a wall of books can be at once a wonderful homely thing and a dominating unmovable feature and sabotages any attempt at redecoration, frightens off potential buyers, and , in the end, a dead weight that prevents their owner from moving on.   TimHannigan shared his thoughts on a new &quot;genre&quot; he has encountered:  There is a peculiar phenomenon in English-language publishing in Southeast Asia: a ubiquitous genre perhaps best thought of as \u201cAsian sleaze\u201d. It spans fiction and non-fiction, but the cover generally features a partially clothed woman with long black hair, either in silhouette, or viewed from behind. The title is usually something along the lines of Bangkok Velvet. The author is always a white man. Whether the book is fictional or purportedly \u201ctrue\u201d, it invariably features a cast of bargirls, whose portrayal is not exactly three-dimensional. It also invariably features a number of white men. If the book is nonfiction the principal white man is the author. If the book is fiction the principal white man is, well, the author (but usually dressed up as a hard-bitten private eye working in Bangkok). These principal white men do not appear to have much self-awareness. Seriously: next time you\u2019re passing through Singapore, Bangkok or Jakarta have a look in the airport bookshop.

However, for a growing number of people in the digital and tech world it is the ancient past that&apos;s providing the inspiration. Feng shui, the ancient Chinese philosophical system that deals with harmonising people with their surroundings, is experiencing something of a resurgence. Big global financial institutions such as HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank are incorporating the principles of feng shui into their online services for customers. Feng shui, used for everything from architecture to urban planning in China for thousands of years, is now being applied to the realms of user experience. User experience, or UX for short, loosely translates as a person&apos;s perception of and response to a brand&apos;s product or service online, such as a website or app. Boz Zou, the head of UX at HeathWallace Asia, the JWT-owned user experience design company, which has HSBC and Standard Chartered among its global clients, systematically uses the principles of feng shui to design and enhance banks&apos; online properties for customers. There are six elements of feng shui that should be applied in digital design, according to Zou. A key component is the notion of harmony, which involves basing design on customer need. Context, or putting people&apos;s particular circumstances, such as if they are using a mobile, at the centre of design is another. Having a sense of flow, or chi, which translates online as being dynamic and continually innovating, is the third element. The other key principles include being seamlessly connected, aesthetically pleasing and sustainable. You could argue that, from a digital design perspective, much of this seems like common sense. Zou would not disagree: &quot;It sounds obvious because it resonates, but many people haven&apos;t really incorporated it into their businesses.&quot; Many big brands already use some feng shui principles, whether they know it or not. Digital design experts cite Apple, Amazon, Nike, and Starbucks among them. Anthony Long, principal technology and marketing practice lead at Harrison Group Ventures, a consulting firm in Chicago, is another proponent and practitioner of feng shui in digital design. He says: &quot;As a large company, Apple presents itself consistently online and in its stores in a way that seems to employ many elements of feng shui. The Apple brand seems to embody\u00a0clarity and precision, ease and abundance.&quot; Zou maintains that PC brands lagged behind Apple because they didn&apos;t understand the importance of the connected experience, a key principle in feng shui. Nonetheless, feng shui is rarely referenced in the context of the digital or tech world. &quot;There is that sense of misperception and myth around feng shui, so that even though brands are applying its principles, they are not explicit about it,&quot; Zou says. It doesn&apos;t help that feng shui is often dismissed as unsubstantiated and superstitious and still suffers from its association in the west with 1990s interior design trends. Also, in the digital world it could be seen as just another way to describe user-centric design, an approach grounded in information about the people who use a product. &quot;People don&apos;t understand the underlying principles, philosophy and science of feng shui,&quot; Boz Zou says, adding: &quot;Feng shui is actually way beyond user-centric design. It&apos;s holistic design \u2026 blending ancient wisdom with modern design thinking.&quot; Neel Banerjee, a Singapore-based customer experience and loyalty specialist, believes the digital community should work to change perceptions of feng shui. &quot;Feng shui certainly needs the support of trained, experienced designers, those in the creative arts, as well as brand marketers and consumers,&quot; he says. Perceptions improve markedly when the approach is backed up with numbers, according to Matt Dooley, the managing director at digital agency Connected Thinking and former head of digital experience for HSBC&apos;s global commercial banking division. &quot;Everything can be measured with digital,&quot; Dooley says. &quot;There are many examples of an increase in visitors, registrations, downloads, completed tasks and sales. At HSBC we simply moved the location of a &apos;buy&apos; button to increase sales by 300 per cent.&quot; And the benefits of feng shui in the digital world are not limited to big corporations \u2013 we can all use some elements of feng shui to declutter our lives online, apparently. You can start by decluttering your social media presence, only sharing information with people you trust, using cleaner designs in your blogs and tools that aggregate content that matters to you, Banerjee advises, adding: &quot;This will help make us productive and positive, our lives more meaningful, and perhaps even encourage us to spend more time in the real world with real people who matter.&quot; Anne Cassidy is a freelance journalist.

There have been a spate of collisions between the two nations&apos; ships \u2013 until now without loss of any vessels \u2013 after a long-running territorial row reignited earlier this month when China towed an oil rig into disputed waters, sparking mob violence in Vietnam that led to several deaths. &quot;A Vietnamese boat from the central city of Da Nang was deliberately encircled by 40 fishing vessels from China before it was attacked by a Chinese ship,&quot; the head of the coastguard, Nguyen Quang Dam, told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday. Other Vietnamese fishing boats rescued the ten crew members in the incident the previous day, officials said. But China&apos;s state news agency Xinhua said the vessel overturned after &quot;harassing and colliding with&quot; a Chinese vessel. China&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang blamed Vietnam for &quot;forcefully disrupting China&apos;s normal operations and its dangerous actions on the seas&quot;, urging it to halt &quot;disruptive and damaging&quot; activities. Experts have warned such incidents could spiral out of control, and the latest incident echoed clashes earlier this month when Vietnam issued video footage showing Chinese boats crashing into and firing water cannons at vessels trying to stop the drilling platform being put into place, while China accused Vietnamese ships of targeting their craft. In Vietnam, angry protestors then attacked and set fire to mostly Taiwanese factories they wrongly believed were run by mainland Chinese firms, killing at least four workers. China claims almost all of the South China Sea, which boasts rich energy resources. The complex, overlapping disputes also involve the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Monday&apos;s incident took place 17 nautical miles from the rig, owned by the state-run China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) Group, which is located off the Paracel or Xisha islands. It is roughly 150 miles (240km) off the Vietnamese coast and 206 miles (330km) from China&apos;s southern Hainan island. Ian Storey, of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore, said there had been previous violent clashes such as the incident in which Chinese naval officers shot dead Vietnamese citizens in the Gulf of Tonkin in 2005, saying they were defending Chinese fishermen. But he added: &quot;It does underscore how dangerous the situation is. &quot;I don&apos;t think either side wants to push this into a military confrontation: China because of the reputational costs, and Vietnam because they know the Chinese military is much more powerful. That said, this is precisely the kind of incident that could trigger an escalation of the dispute which might be difficult to contain.&quot; Storey said China had indicated the rig would be in place until August, and would presumably withdraw it then \u2013 not least because of the high cost of the operation. &quot;This is not a commercial operation; they are sending a political statement [and] a very costly statement; I&apos;ve seen estimates that it costs $300,000 a day to keep the oil rig on site, plus the costs of other ships,&quot; he said. &quot;In the meantime, Vietnam is seriously looking at a legal challenge to the oil rig&apos;s presence.&quot; The Philippines has already launched a legal case against China. Storey said that if Vietnam did so, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea could issue a preliminary ruling that the rig should cease operation in a matter of weeks. But he added: &quot;My guess is that China would simply ignore it and say ITLOS has no jurisdiction.&quot; He said China was sending a message it had a right to resources and was prepared to share them, but that Vietnam and the Philippines should desist from unilaterally developing them. &quot;The other claimants are not prepared to do that, because under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea they have a strong claim to exclusive rights. Why share something that belongs to you already?&quot; Hong Nong, from China&apos;s National Institute for South China Sea Studies, said Vietnam had overreacted. &quot;Among the six parties to the dispute, China is the only one to have had no oil rig in the South China Sea. China has shown self-restraint,&quot; he said. &quot;In the past 10 years, China has been working on the preparation of an oil rig. Vietnam should have known that. They kept silent, and accepted it.&quot; Hong said that the tensions were unlikely to lead to military conflict, adding: &quot;The best way to resolve the problem is for the two countries to go back to the negotiation table, avoid the maritime collisions, and especially avoid casualties.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/29/us-deportation-machine-obama-immigration-reform", "sentences": ["Like millions of people living in the US, I was born elsewhere \u2013 in my case, in Singapore \u2013 and, when I was 13, my family moved to Valley View, Texas."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-29T17:16:20Z", "title": "The US deportation machine held me for 313 days. Obama needs to fix it now | Nazry Mustakim", "tags": ["US news", "Obama administration", "US politics"], "article": "At 6am on 30 March 2011, four armed officers knocked on the door of the house that my wife, Hope, and I owned in Waco, Texas. At first I thought there was some sort of emergency \u2013 but then they told me I was under arrest, handcuffed me and put me in a car.  My crime? I had legally immigrated to the United States in 1993 \u2013 and in 2005, I was arrested for drug possession, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to probation and a rehabilitation program. I had not understood that pleading guilty to a non-violent crime meant that I would have an &quot;aggravated felony&quot; on my record, or that doing so would lead toward deportation. I certainly didn&apos;t know that offenses that were neither aggravated nor felonies are defined as &quot;aggravated felonies&quot; under immigration law, or that they required my mandatory detention and deportation. Like millions of people living in the US, I was born elsewhere \u2013 in my case, in Singapore \u2013 and, when I was 13, my family moved to Valley View, Texas. My story is typical in other ways, as well: I drank alcohol at a young age (as over 25% of people between 12 and 20 do every month) and, like an estimated 24m Americans per month, I experimented with drugs. Unlike most drug users, though, I was one of the approximately 1.5m people arrested for drug possession in 2005. I accepted a guilty plea, went to rehabilitation and served out my probation \u2013 I never spent a day in jail. My green card was renewed without incident, so I moved on with my life: I took a job at Mission Waco&apos;s homeless shelter, My Brother&apos;s Keeper, and sponsored others who were looking for help with their addiction. I met and eventually married Hope, a US citizen, completed college and bought a house. We were ready to start a family when everything fell apart. That night in 2011, the officers \u2013 who I learned were with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2013 drove me away from my home but gave me little information about what I could expect. One of them told me that my case had fallen through the cracks in the four years since my guilty plea, but that, after an administrative hearing, I&apos;d likely be able to post bail and go back to my family. He was wrong. The officers first drove me to a holding tank in Waco, and then took me and four others to Austin to board a corrections bus headed south. By the end of the first day after my arrest, we were 250 miles from Waco at the South Texas Detention Center in the dusty town of Pearsall (roughly midway between San Antonio and the Mexican border). I was incarcerated there for 313 days before I was released \u2013 I was never able to post bail and it was only through my wife&apos;s determination that I was ever able to go home. She found a law firm to (successfully) file an appeal to reopen my drug case in the hopes of reducing the original charges against me, which would then remove my &quot;aggravated felony&quot; designation. After the case was re-opened, the district attorney asked the sheriff&apos;s office to produce the drugs they had taken from me on the day of my arrest \u2013 but the evidence had been lost, and so the case was dismissed. The media caught wind of our story and organizers rallied in support of my release: the pressure on ICE was unrelenting and eventually my deportation order was dropped. In February 2012, I walked out of the detention center and headed home to Waco with Hope. Today, I work two jobs, we have a brand new baby boy, and Hope is pursuing a master&apos;s degree in social work at Baylor University. But the education I got at the hands of the government was more eye-opening than most of what we learned in school. Due to draconian mandatory detention laws, most of the people detained alongside me were also unable, like me, to get a bail or bond hearing \u2013 and 70% of people in detention nationwide are there because of mandatory detention policies. Where I was detained, all of us were put to work under supervision of security guards doing menial labor on the grounds of the center. Most of my fellow detainees did not even speak English, but the questions we all had \u2013 would we be deported? Would we ever see our families again? \u2013 seemed to fall on deaf ears anyway. No one was provided legal counsel, and immigration judges&apos; backlog of cases made it impossible for them to spend more than just a few minutes with each of us. More shocking is that the detention center at which I was held is actually a private prison owned and operated (profitably) by the GEO Group. It is just one part of the current immigration detention system, which is designed to keep a minimum of 34,000 people locked up on any given day \u2013 there&apos;s even a Congressional mandate to that effect. I realized that I was simply a number to help the agency reach their goal of 34,000 detainees \u2013 and at a yearly cost of $50,000 per person \u2013 with no regard for the circumstances of my case or the family I had left behind. Though the arbitrary and costly detention bed quota is a Congressional mandate, President Obama has it within his power to stop this country&apos;s mass detention and deportation machine \u2013 but instead he announced on Wednesday that he was going to put off any action until after the elections in November. Although America is proud of its system of impartial justice, there was no room for justice inside those prison walls, and no real opportunity for a fair hearing. Now, I want to help fight for a better America for my own son, so he can live in a country in which everyone has access to justice and no one is locked up for the sake of an arbitrary quota."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/30/ancient-underground-city-cappadocia-fruit-produce-warehouse", "sentences": ["Singapore, meanwhile, is planning to use a 150-acre cavern under the city to store fuel and build a facility for scientists and researchers."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-30T09:06:24Z", "title": "How the ancient underground city of Cappadocia became a fruit warehouse", "tags": ["Cities", "Turkey", "Farming", "Culture"], "article": "The 98 square kilometres of the Cappadocia region in Turkey make for a strange landscape. Powdery white soil gives the place a lunar feel. The hollowed out hillsides and 10-metre tall \u201cfairy chimneys\u201d, a tourist attraction crafted by wind and rain, could be leftovers from a 1970s James Bond set. At night, lights flicker in the cones of rock, which hundreds of people call home. Beneath the earth, however, things look even stranger: a network of caves, connected into what used to be entire subterranean cities. Derinkuyu, in southern Cappadocia, was once home to as many as 20,000 residents living together underground. There&apos;s a huge bathhouse, complete with a set of private rooms and tall ceilings to allow steam to rise, all of it ventilated by a system of shafts that run for dozens of kilometres in every direction \u2013 sometimes a vast distance from the populated areas to trick potential invaders. Long abandoned, the underground cities of Cappadocia have rather suddenly been rediscovered: by the produce industry. The constant underground temperature of about 13C make the caves an ideal storage climate for thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables: apples, cabbage and cauliflower stay fresh for up to four weeks; citrus fruits, pears and potatoes for months. In a cave near the village of Ortahisar, nearly 6m crates of lemons sit in endless stacks. They arrive from Turkey\u2019s Mediterranean coast on trucks and are unloaded by hand. Labourers \u2013 mostly women \u2013 package and stack the fruit, which then is stored underground until it is needed for export to Europe, Russia and elsewhere.     Potatoes stored in the Cappadocia caves can stay fresh for many months. Photograph: Ali Kabas/Alamy    Okan Yazgan, who runs the Aravan Evi hotel here, has taken advantage. \u201cWe have a cave store with a capacity of 100 tonnes, but we do not have a large enough area for growing potatoes. So we rent our store space,\u201d he said. The potatoes are stored underground and sold in situ when prices increase during winter and spring, Yazgan added.  The volcanic rock of these underground cities is moist and soft to the touch \u2013 a car key or pen easily leaves a mark \u2013 and the walls carry the marks of its former residents. Small ridges can be seen on the walls and ceilings, made as long as 3,500 years ago by the first people to realise that they could chisel out a home here. They liked living underground for much of the same reason that the produce vendors do: when visiting Cappadocia in 400 BC, Xenophon, a student of Socrates, reported seeing goats, sheep, cows and poultry fed on straw and hay. \u201cCorn, rice, vegetables and barley beer was stored in large pots,\u201d he wrote. Could other cities learn from Cappadocia&apos;s example? Berlin is home to many kilometres of underground tunnels and rooms, built in the second world war to protect against bombings; Switzerland has enough underground space to shelter every citizen in the event of nuclear war. Singapore, meanwhile, is planning to use a 150-acre cavern under the city to store fuel and build a facility for scientists and researchers. Although cities that don&apos;t already have underground space would likely see limited benefits \u2013 meat and frozen foods certainly would require the refrigeration only fridges and supermarkets freezers provide \u2013 Nikolai Bobylev, an environmental scientist at Saint Petersburg State University, says underground urban space is an overlooked resource.     Goreme in the Cappacdocia region has been the site of an underground city for centuries. Photograph: Dan Wiklund/Getty    \u201cWe can use underground space for all the urban services that do not require daylight \u2013 transport, waste management, retail,\u201d he says. \u201cThus we can save pressure [on] above-ground space for living, recreation, greenery \u2013 creating compact and more sustainable cities.\u201d In Cappadocia, some of the underground warehouses have a capacity of 20,000 tonnes, but the financial incentive is proving irresistible: local companies and those in the produce business have begun carving out new caves in the rock, and international companies such as Frito Lay are reported to be planning to invest.  Thousands of years since they were first created, the underground cities of Cappadocia are growing once again. \u2022 Russia\u2019s dreary suburbs make for creative hotspots"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/30/rolls-royce-remote-controlled-cargo-ships", "sentences": ["&quot;You have these highly trained people but they only operate the ship a small part of the time \u2013 why not have them operate ships all the time?&quot; Under Rolls-Royce&apos;s plan captains will be relocated from the bridges of ships to unremarkable office blocks in London, Singapore or Oslo, from where they will control fleets of ships on big screens akin to air traffic control centres."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-30T19:12:53Z", "title": "Rolls-Royce plans remote-controlled ships with no captain or crew on board", "tags": ["Rolls-Royce", "Business", "Engineering", "Technology"], "article": "A fleet of giant cargo ships, up to almost a quarter of a mile long and wider than a motorway, are to crisscross the world&apos;s oceans without a captain or crew on board. The remote-controlled vessels, which could set sail within the decade, are the latest development in the growing trend for unmanned vehicles, with drone aircraft already flying and Google planning to introduce driverless cars. Rolls-Royce, the British engineering company developing the ships, claims the unmanned ships will be cheaper, greener and safer than those with a full complement of captain and crew. &quot;It&apos;s about making the ships more safe,&quot; said Oskar Levander, Rolls-Royce&apos;s head of marine innovation and technology. &quot;If you look at most accidents in marine they are happening because of human error \u2013 a lack of concentration and people becoming tired. We can provide a safer, more comfortable and better way of steering the ship.&quot; Levander said marine technology had progressed so fast in recent years that most of the steering and control of ships was already automated, relieving captains of many of their traditional duties for large parts of long voyages. &quot;If you think about a captain today, most of the work he does every day is on [managing] the crew and bureaucracy \u2013 he is more of an administration person, but he is still trained in operating a ship,&quot; Levander said. &quot;You have these highly trained people but they only operate the ship a small part of the time \u2013 why not have them operate ships all the time?&quot; Under Rolls-Royce&apos;s plan captains will be relocated from the bridges of ships to unremarkable office blocks in London, Singapore or Oslo, from where they will control fleets of ships on big screens akin to air traffic control centres. &quot;Maybe a captain can operate 10 ships \u2026 it might be easier to have a pool of 10 captains in control of 100 ships,&quot; said Levander, a Finn working at Rolls-Royce&apos;s Blue Ocean research centre in \u00c5lesund, a small town known for its art nouveau architecture on Norway&apos;s remote western coast eight hours&apos; drive from Oslo. For most the of voyage, captaining the ships will amount to little more than watching blinking lights travel across a computer screen. &quot;Then, when it approaches port, control of the ship is passed to a full bridge simulator with 360\u00b0 views.&quot; Levander said the simulators, which are already used for crew training and will be hooked up to dozens of cameras on the ships, would provide captains with a far better view of the vessel and any obstacles than they would have from the bridge. &quot;If we&apos;re going to do this, it must be as safe if not safer,&quot; he said. &quot;We can create a better view of reality. The camera can see better than the human eye, they can spot objects in the water that the human eye cannot.&quot; Levander brushes aside concerns that the ships could pose a danger to other seafarers and the environment. &quot;We have drone aircraft flying, we have [drone] helicopters, we have Google cars \u2013 these are situations where you need to react in a fraction of a second, with ships you have a lot of margin. A ship isn&apos;t going to run up and hit me,&quot; he said. &quot;The point is, who is normally in danger if you hit something? It is the crew on the ship, they are the ones that get injured. It is safer if they are not there in the dangerous position.&quot; If a ship does get into difficulties, spring a leak or lose the satellite link to the control centre it will &quot;go into safe mode, stop and float there until someone comes&quot;. The technology, which will be tested on a real ship off the coast of \u00c5lesund in the next few months, will be used only on bulk cargo vessels and not passenger ships. Levander said the technology would be used on cargo cable ferries (which are guided across rivers on cables) within the next couple of years, &quot;but the real benefit will be in ocean going tankers and bulkers&quot;, where remote control would cut operating costs by up to 30%. Spotting the potential cost savings, cargo companies are keen to get remote-controls ships on the water soon, but winning approval from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), the global regulator of shipping, is likely to take some time. If approval is granted, Levander reckons more than half of the world&apos;s bulk cargo ships will become remote-controlled, with container ships following later. &quot;We have ship owners who are seriously interested, but they know they are not going to sign the contract on them this year or next year \u2013 it will take some time.&quot; The new technology is likely to be most popular in northern Europe, where most marine technology is developed and where crew wages are the most expensive. The prospect of remote-controlled ships comes as cargo companies are beginning to struggle to find people willing to spend months at sea on not hugely generous wages. &quot;Young people don&apos;t want to go into shipping any more, it&apos;s not attractive,&quot; Levander said. &quot;In the past you joined up to see the world, today you take a low-cost airline ticket and go.&quot; The EU is funding a \u20ac3.8m (\u00a33m) study into the safety and feasibility of unmanned vessels. The maritime unmanned navigation through intelligence in networks (Munin) programme said: &quot;Seagoing professions are increasingly perceived as unattractive these days.&quot; &quot;Remote-control shipping will also make a captain&apos;s life more appealing as they will no longer have to leave their families for months on end,&quot; Levander said. &quot;We can provide the possibility of working in shipping but doing it from an office near your home where you can drive back home after a day&apos;s work. &quot;In the future, we would like to spread them [the shipping control centres] out around the world so you only have daytime jobs.&quot; Not having crews will remove the need for heating, air conditioning, sewage systems and lifeboats, freeing up even more space for cargo. It will also lead to a comprehensive redesign of ships, stripping out the bridge, handle rails and access points, allowing a sleeker shape and making life much harder for pirates attempting a hijacking. &quot;If you take the crew off you have much less interest for the pirates because you don&apos;t have hostages,&quot; Levander said. &quot;Even if they do get on board what are they going to do? You can remotely shut down the ship. They can sit there on the ship in the middle of the ocean but they cannot steer it \u2013 you can drive them to the nearest military base.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/31/volcanic-ash-cloud-sangeang-api-indonesia-grounds-australia-flights", "sentences": ["International flights to and from Australia to Singapore, East Timor and the Indonesian holiday island of Bali were among those cancelled, including those departing from Australia&apos;s eastern seaboard."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-31T15:35:18Z", "title": "Volcanic ash cloud from Sangeang Api grounds Australia flights", "tags": ["Indonesia", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Australia news", "Volcanoes", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Air transport", "Darwin"], "article": "     An ashcloud has grounded flights between Australia and south-east Asia, and all domestic flights from Darwin airport in the north of the country.

International flights to and from Australia to Singapore, East Timor and the Indonesian holiday island of Bali were among those cancelled, including those departing from Australia&apos;s eastern seaboard. &quot;The volcano is undergoing a sustained, rather significant eruption at the moment, so for the last 10 hours we&apos;ve been observing large masses of volcanic ash being generated,&quot; Emile Jansons, the manager of the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre, told the agency. &quot;At the moment it has slowed down a little bit since its initial big eruption, but nobody has a very good handle on what this volcano is likely to do in the next 24 hours or beyond,&quot; he said. Sangeang Api&apos;s last eruption of similar magnitude occurred in 1999, he added. Based on weather conditions, it is unlikely that the ash cloud will dissipate before it reaches Australia&apos;s eastern airports and major populations centres, Jansons said. He also said Darwin would be impacted until at least Sunday, and Virginia Sanders, a spokeswoman for Darwin International airport confirmed that all inbound and outbound flights had been cancelled. Darwin&apos;s proximity to south-east Asia makes it an important Australian gateway to countries such as Indonesia and East Timor, and an important hub for oil and natural gas off Australia&apos;s north. Volcanic ash can be extremely dangerous to aircraft and can cause engine failure or damage.

For Michael Sanders, head of research for the UK team, it&apos;s an exciting time to be a research economist. &quot;This is the dead centre of the middle of the universe,&quot; he says. &quot;We have an opportunity to change the world for the better and I think we might actually get to do that.&quot; The team uses insights from behavioural psychology to identify reasons why people make bad choices \u2013 from smoking to filling in a tax form too late \u2013 and then tests small changes in the way choices are presented to &quot;nudge&quot; them into making better decisions. This is usually done using randomised controlled trials. Among its early successes, the unit claims to have brought forward the payment of \u00a330m a year in income tax (by introducing new reminder letters that informed recipients that most of their neighbours had already paid) and recruited 100,000 more people each year to carry organ donor cards (by discovering that the most effective slogan to present to people renewing their tax disc online was one that appealed to them personally - &quot;If you needed an organ transplant, would you have one?&quot;). It was established as the world&apos;s first behavioural insights unit in July 2010 and spun out of the Cabinet Office in early February in order to respond with greater flexibility to the growing demand for &quot;nudge&quot; services. It&apos;s now a for-profit social purpose company, jointly owned by its employees, the government and Nesta. The team now sells its services \u2013 mostly to central government departments and local authorities \u2013 but has expanded to take on a wider variety and greater number of projects, including for foreign governments, the World Bank and UNDP. Sanders admits, as an academic, sales skills are not his strong point but says, as a former civil servant, he had already honed his people skills and that the unit isn&apos;t suffering from missing skills. &quot;We haven&apos;t had to put on the hard sell and go knocking on the doors of foreign governments,&quot; he says. &quot;The focus is on delivering work at as high a standard as possible and letting that sell itself.&quot; The management team, which includes Sanders and chief executive David Halpern, meets once a week to decide which projects to take on \u2013 usually those that advance social good and do not put the team&apos;s reputation at risk. Among other projects the team is currently running a research centre focused on improving adult literacy and numeracy, commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Not everyone is impressed. Although many civil servants are excited by tools that enable them to do their jobs better, some cynics within government are probably &quot;used to fads coming along&quot;, Sanders says. &quot;Maybe there&apos;s an attitude that if you sit down and carry on with things these annoying guys will go away. However, if we show them the intervention we worked on with HMRC, and confront them with a bar chart that says this brought forward the payment of \u00a3200m worth of tax and it was free, they are very convinced by that. &quot;We can&apos;t just rest on our laurels; we need to get out there and show people the amazing evidence that&apos;s being produced.&quot; As a part-privatised company, the nudge unit is no longer subject to freedom of information (FOI) requests, a move criticised by sceptics already suspicious of the practice of &quot;implementing policy on the subconscious of the British public&quot;. This is a very negative view, says Sanders, quick to point out that any correspondence with Whitehall can be subject to FOI. The team will also be audited by the National Audit Office. Applying behavioural insights to public policy does not impinge on people&apos;s choices, Sanders adds. &quot;The people we&apos;re dealing with aren&apos;t typically amoral libertarians who are not paying their taxes in order to stick it to the man. They&apos;ve forgotten to fill in their tax return. &quot;Everybody wants to have filled in their tax return but nobody wants to fill in their tax return. It&apos;s about trying to get those two to gel together. &quot;It&apos;s also about getting government out of the way. If you get a letter through the post and it doesn&apos;t tell you what to do you&apos;re going to ignore it. Even if it&apos;s from HMRC who are big and scary.&quot; Many government documents are overly complex and unclear, he says. The nudge unit has been at the forefront of Whitehall&apos;s evidence agenda, pushing the debates around evidence-based policymaking and using randomised controlled tests to assess the quality of policy interventions. Halpern also heads up the What Works network of research centres, which gather evidence to inform government policy in health, education, crime reduction, early intervention, ageing and local economic growth. The team has played a major role in pushing this agenda on the international stage; Rory Gallagher, director of international partnerships, advises the governments of New South Wales (Australia) and Singapore. The 2014 behavioural exchange conference is a chance to form links between experts, share experiences and avoid duplication of effort. Sanders joined the team more than two years ago as a part-time research fellow (working rather more often than that, he adds) funded by the The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) as part of his PhD, which found that people were more likely to donate to charity if given a small packet of sweets. He says he&apos;s seen a huge change in the culture of government, even during his short stint as a civil servant. He commutes from Oxford every day, leaving home around 5.30am and returning as late as 9pm, and pursues an academic career at weekends. &quot;Why wouldn&apos;t you work this hard? We have the chance to run cool research and try as hard as we possibly can to make the world a better place. The fact that I&apos;m allowed to do this as a living is a small miracle. &quot;I really don&apos;t want my tombstone to read: managed to get people to give to charity by giving them sweets. It&apos;s about saving the world, one randomised controlled test at a time.&quot; \u2022 Want your say?

Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, was arrested in Marseille in connection with the killing of two Israeli tourists and a French volunteer at the museum nine days ago. Prosecutors said that among his possessions were weapons identical to those used in the Brussels attack, as well as a 40-second video confession. The guns were wrapped in a white sheet scrawled with the name of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, an extremist group fighting in Syria, the Paris prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins said. He said the suspect had spent about a year in Syria. At a news conference in Brussels, the Belgian state prosecutor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric van Leeuw said the voice in the film admitted to the attack &quot;against Jews and [threatened to] set Belgium on fire&quot;. The speaker, believed to be Nemmouche, who is not seen on camera, said he tried to record the actual shooting, but that the camera did not work. The officials said Nemmouche, who is from Roubaix, in northern France, travelled to Syria last year to join jihadist fighters after becoming radicalised in prison. Two Israeli tourists were shot at point-blank range at the Jewish museum. The gunman, who was wearing a cap and sunglasses in the attack, which was filmed by the museum&apos;s surveillance cameras, also killed a French volunteer and critically wounded a fourth victim before fleeing on foot. According to Molins, Nemmouche&apos;s bag contained a Kalashnikov and a .38 calibre revolver with 57 cartridges, as well a dark cap, sunglasses, a balaclava, and a gas mask. All these items plus the clothing found in the bag matched those of the Brussels killer, he said. Nemmouche, described as a drifter by officials, spent five years in jail in France on robbery charges and headed to Syria \u2013 via the UK, Lebanon and Turkey \u2013 in December 2012, three weeks after being released from prison in Lille. On leaving Syria, he covered his tracks by flying to Malaysia and Singapore before returning to Europe, Molins said. He was noticed by German authorities in March 2014, who alerted the French counter-terrorism agency. Leeuw said Nemmouche was not known to Belgian police. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, praised the work of the French authorities, saying the &quot;presumed killer&quot; had been arrested &quot;as soon as he set foot in France, which happened to be in Marseille&quot;. Nemmouche is being held on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. He is being questioned at the headquarters of the French counter-terrorism agency outside Paris, and has remained silent, the French prosecutor said. Police are trying to establish whether the Brussels shootings were an isolated act by a &quot;lone wolf&quot; or whether the suspect belonged to a radical Islamic network. Two other people were arrested on Sunday in the Belgian town of Courtrai, where Nemmouche had stayed. Hollande, speaking during a visit to Normandy ahead of D-day commemorations next Friday, said France would show no mercy to French Islamists who travelled to Syria to take up arms against President Bashar al-Assad. &quot;We shall fight them, fight them, fight them,&quot; he said. &quot;The whole government is mobilised to follow jihadists and prevent them from harming, in particular when they come back to France or Europe.&quot; According to the interior ministry, a total 285 French nationals are believed to be fighting with Islamist guerrillas in Syria \u2013 including the sister of Mohamed Merah, who was killed in a police siege after a shooting spree in which he murdered three French soldiers and four Jewish civilians in Toulouse and Montauban in March 2012. Souad Merah disappeared from France last month, after saying that she was proud of her brother. The Belgian case bears parallels with that of Merah, which gripped France. Commentators pointed out that Merah and the suspect in the Jewish museum shootings came from similar backgrounds and had engaged in petty crime before becoming radicalised in prison. Merah filmed his shootings \u2013 mostly carried out at point-blank range \u2013 with the same type of device allegedly used by Nemmouche, a GoPro camera. His victims included three Jewish schoolchildren. Nemmouche&apos;s lawyer, Soulila Badaoui, said she would not characterise the suspect as someone &quot;predestined for this type of act&quot;, although she acknowledged that it was possible he may have become a convert to radical Islam in jail. He had lost contact with his family during his spells in prison."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jun/02/modern-family-television-marketers-diversity", "sentences": ["In Singapore, Coca-Cola approached multi-generation living differently."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-02T09:48:22Z", "title": "Modern family: can marketers catch up with culture?", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Advertising", "Marketing & PR", "Advertising", "Television"], "article": "Whether you look to population polls or popular TV for your socio-cultural trends, one thing is clear: the nuclear family has been nuked. Around the globe, we&apos;re witnessing an explosion of new family structures. In the US, cohabitation has doubled since 1990 and 41% of births are to unmarried women. Twice as many Britons have mixed-ethnic parentage compared with a single ethnic background. And in Australia, nearly half of same-sex couples are raising two or more children. As USA Today said: &quot;Whatever a traditional family used to be, it is no longer.&quot; Global TV culture deserves a lot of credit for reflecting the changing face of family. From Modern Family in the US to Em Familia (&quot;In Family&quot;) in Brazil, TV has brought the diversity and quirkiness of modern families to centre stage. This much is clear \u2013 we&apos;re finally forming the family units we want, instead of the ones we&apos;ve been told to. Yet, advertisers are among the last to embrace a broader family landscape. The global research and advisory company Stylus said: &quot;Brands still have some way to go in showcasing the diversity of the modern family.&quot; Here&apos;s how marketers can catch up with modern family culture. Represent: know your tribeExemplifying your core user is the simplest way to show love to today&apos;s evolving family. Any marketer can cast diverse talent \u2013 as Chevy and Cheerios did this year \u2013 but knowing what makes your tribe&apos;s situation special makes for a deeper connection. For example, single mums are a key segment for the US food producer Oscar Mayer. Since many rely on extended family to fill childcare gaps, the brand introduced Grandpa Frank \u2013 whose grandkids and daughter live with him \u2013 in its latest round of advertising. From the UK, retailer Mamas &amp; Papas firmly positioned itself on the side of their tribe with a global campaign called How We Roll. The ads featured same-sex and single parents, and online shorts offered insight into their daily lives. Connect: act accordinglyIf you&apos;re already talking the talk, walk the walk. Use your brand&apos;s behaviour to better cater to modern families&apos; needs. In the US, the mobile phone provider Sprint introduced a new phone plan that plays to the trend of surrogate friend-families by letting users decide who is in their family. The ad campaign is centred around the Frobinsons, a new-wave family unit that includes a hamster dad, African-American grandpa, French daughter, cardigan-clad mum and Gor-Don, the goth roomie of the son, Chuck. The Japanese fashion retailer Beams launched a store to capitalise on the multi-generation landscape. Designed to accommodate the needs and tastes of three generations, fashions for each group are housed in one space so they can shop together; a fourth collection contains matching items. In Singapore, Coca-Cola approached multi-generation living differently. The #CalmComebacks digital campaign helped their millennial base to navigate awkward questions from relatives with witty one-liners to questions such as &quot;How much do you make?&quot; and &quot;Why aren&apos;t you married?&quot; Support: stand in solidarityTo be permanently rooted in diversity and acceptance, make celebrating real families an enduring strategy that your brand stands by and defends. From the US, Honey Maid&apos;s This Is Wholesome effort is a shining example. The work doesn&apos;t just show diversity, which other brands have done; its core message is that unconventional families are wholesome. In response to the inevitable controversy, the brand held firm. It released a follow-up spot which made art of hateful online comments and proclaimed that the only thing that matters when defining family is love. Its behaviour backed up a belief that even if the image of family has changed, what defines it hasn&apos;t. Brands that depict non-traditional families earn higher equity marksAcknowledging modern families is more than nice sentiment. The media group NBCUniversal&apos;s Brand Power Index, which measures consumer perception of 500 brands, found that brands that most accurately depict non-traditional families \u2013 like Dove, Oscar Mayer, Microsoft, and Samsung \u2013 have higher equity marks than brands that don&apos;t. New methodologies have emerged to help marketers understand audiences at a deeper level. For example, the consumer research company Networked Insights can sample online posts from hundreds of niche audiences to place them into small sub-groups for marketers to hone their message to. These capabilities matter because the modern family continues to evolve. As Andrew Cherlin, professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University, said, &quot;It&apos;s a mistake to think this is the endpoint of enormous change. We are still very much in the midst of it.&quot; Jennifer Costello is planning director and Nick Barham is chief strategy officer at TBWA\\Chiat\\Day LA To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, sign up free for Media Network membership.

Khoo was snapped up two years ago by BBC2 for cookery show The Little Paris Kitchen, which featured the then unknown whipping up dishes in her tiny Parisian flat. The series was seen by almost 2 million viewers and has since been broadcast in the US, Australia, Croatia, Denmark, Italy, Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil and parts of the Middle East. But there has been no follow-up on BBC2, and Croydon-born Khoo&apos;s two new Kitchen Notebook series, which cover London&apos;s food scene and cosmopolitan centres such as Istanbul and Stockholm, are airing from Monday on the Good Food channel. Khoo singled out Channel 4, which features cookery shows from Jamie Oliver, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Heston Blumenthal, for particular criticism. She said that Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry, Lorraine Pascale and Nigella Lawson were the only female chefs given significant airtime. &quot;It was definitely more difficult to get the second one [series],&quot; Khoo told the Radio Times. &quot;You&apos;re competing with a saturated market and I&apos;m not as established as Nigella or Lorraine. &quot;You are also up against a lot of things as a woman. Last time there was a fat woman chef was the Two Fat Ladies \u2026 and they called them Two Fat Ladies! There are male chefs who are bigger, but they don&apos;t call them fat. &quot;As a woman you have to tick all these boxes to be able to be on TV. I know I look a certain way and that&apos;s partly why I&apos;m on TV. If I were really ugly and fat, I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have had the same chance.&quot; Khoo, who has returned to Britain, added: &quot;It&apos;s great that Mary Berry got a primetime TV show, but I don&apos;t think there are enough women chefs on TV. &quot;I think they should give an opportunity to others. I mean otherwise it&apos;s Lorraine and Nigella. Where are the women on Channel 4? It&apos;s pathetic.&quot; Khoo, who stars alongside actor Emma Thompson and singers Annie Lennox and Rita Ora in the Marks &amp; Spencer &quot;leading ladies&quot; advertising campaign, told the Radio Times that she did not want to be filmed suggestively licking her spoon, in the style made famous by Nigella Lawson. &quot;Oh I hate that. I hate eating food on camera \u2013 I always cringe afterwards!,&quot; she said, adding: &quot;I was fortunate that what you see on TV is who I am.

There are. But the idea that the staff slog long into the night isn&apos;t correct. Instead, the beds are used for lunchtime snoozing \u2013 a Chinese version of the siesta. But midday naps for the workforce do not mean that Huawei is not a relentlessly aggressive competitor: it is one of a number of homegrown Chinese technology companies that are rapidly outgrowing their home market and are now seeking \u2013 or already achieving \u2013 dominance in the rest of the world. These are the companies set to become the biggest business brands of the future. Lenovo The Beijing-based company \u2013 slogan &quot;For those who do&quot; \u2013 shot to prominence when it bought IBM&apos;s PC business in 2005. The idea that the ThinkPad, beloved of American business people, would be made by a Chinese company caused unease at first; the $1.75bn (\u00a31.04bn) purchase attracted intense regulatory attention. Lenovo is now the world&apos;s largest maker of PCs, ahead of the former leader, US-based HP, in number of units if not quite by revenue. And it keeps acquiring what look like worn-out US technology businesses. In recent months it has bought IBM&apos;s server business (for $2.3bn) and the lossmaking Google-owned Motorola smartphone business (for $2.9bn). The latter move made it the world&apos;s third-largest smartphone maker, behind Samsung and Apple, with a combined share of 6% of the world market. But its ambitions are far bigger. Bloomberg BusinessWeek, in an in-depth profile of the company, depicted it as a sort of technology scavenger, jumping on items that others had discarded. &quot;For Lenovo, the competition has shifted from HP and [PC makers] Acer and Dell to [smartphone makers] Samsung and Apple,&quot; ex--IBMer and Lenovo chairman William Grabe told Bloomberg. &quot;Lenovo wants to be a $100bn company, and you&apos;re not going to get there by improving PCs or even servers.&quot; But it could be a hard road. Lenovo&apos;s overall operating profit margin was just 2.1% for its 201314 financial year; the analyst Richard Windsor points out that its total operating profit of $231m, in the quarter just gone, is about the same as Motorola has been losing while under Google&apos;s wing. If Lenovo can&apos;t turn that business around, that marriage could turn ugly. Huawei It&apos;s pronounced &quot;Hoo-wah-way&quot;, and is the second-largest provider of telecoms network equipment in the world, behind Sweden&apos;s Ericsson. Total group sales in 2013 were $39bn, and it has so far received 36,311 patents \u2013 many of the most recent relating to high-speed 4G LTE network technologies. It is also funding work at the University of Surrey to develop 5G. Despite its success supplying telephone backbone networks, Huawei has been dogged by suspicions within western governments that its systems could be used to secretly tap networks on behalf of the Chinese government. The US and Australia have banned it from public-sector contracts, and the US House of Representatives&apos; intelligence committee said in 2012 that private-sector companies should be informed about the alleged threat. That is because the company was founded by Ren Zhengfei, an ex-officer of China&apos;s People&apos;s Liberation Army. But the company says the claims are baseless. Its board includes westerners, and it has an unusual leadership system in which three board members take the chief executive role on a rotating basis. Huawei&apos;s ambitions are global. China generated just over a third of its revenues in 2013, but Europe, the Middle East and Africa were larger (36% against 35%), and grew by over 9%. It is also looking to expand beyond phone networks, into system configuration for large businesses \u2013 and has ambitions in smartphones: it shipped 52m units in 2013, up 60%, roughly at breakeven point. In Europe, its sales have more than doubled in the past year as price-sensitive buyers go for cheaper handsets, unworried by brand, according to research by Kantar ComTech. Xiaomi The Chinese smartphone and tablet-maker sometimes called &quot;China&apos;s Apple&quot; shot to international notice in August 2013 when it poached Hugo Barra, then the head of product management for Google&apos;s Android, to lead its international business development. Xiaomi (say &quot;shower&quot;, but replace the second syllable with &quot;mee&quot;) has built up an eager following in China for its smartphones, which are developed and released at a frantic rate and sold in even more frantic online sales. The company is expanding beyond China to Indonesia, and has changed its name to &quot;Mi&quot; (far simpler for non-Chinese to pronounce). Barra says it will soon enter India, where smartphone sales are exploding. The company had a triumphal April in China, outselling Samsung \u2013 normally the top seller \u2013 for the second time, according to Kantar. If it can keep repeating that, it may become a serious threat to all its rivals. Tencent Holdings Based, like Huawei, in Shenzhen, it created the widely used Tencent QQ messenger app \u2013 with more than 650m active accounts \u2013 far more than WhatsApp (bought for $19bn by Facebook) with its 500m or so users. Tencent is the fifth-largest internet-only company in the world (after Google, Amazon, Facebook and eBay), but is hardly known outside Asia. Yet it&apos;s listed on the Hong Kong stock market, where its market value is about $150bn. Why hasn&apos;t it been heard of outside China and Hong Kong? Principally, because it hasn&apos;t begun trying to compete on smartphone platforms beyond those borders. It generates plenty of revenue through its QQ web portal, multiplayer online games, PaiPal auction site and smartphone apps such as the quirkily named Dididache Taxi system (for finding taxis for would-be passengers). The latter is the biggest in China with more than 40 million registered users. Its sheer financial heft means that, if it flexes its muscles beyond China, it may put car hire companies such as Uber or Hailo in the shade. Baidu China&apos;s most-used search engine isn&apos;t Google; in fact the US company has a single-digit share of search in the country. Instead it&apos;s Baidu, founded in 2000 by Robin Li \u2013 a former software developer in New Jersey, who in 1996 received a patent for a web search-ranking technology (Larry Page and Sergey Brin were doing the same in California at the time; their patented system became Google). He built a search engine that complies with the Chinese government&apos;s strict (and often changing) rules, and now has almost two-thirds of the search market there \u2013 a gigantic market of more than a billion users. Does Baidu intend to grow beyond China? A 2007 attempt in Japan failed; since then it has set up research centres and offices in Singapore, Australia, India and Brazil. The US may be next. Baidu is taking things cautiously \u2013 but that doesn&apos;t mean its ambitions aren&apos;t large. ZTE Another Shenzhen-based firm, ZTE makes both network equipment and the handsets and software to connect to it. According to research company IDC, it is one of the world&apos;s 10 biggest smartphone makers \u2013 and jostling for position with Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi. Like Huawei, it has faced suspicion from western governments, who worry that it could be undermining their infrastructure. ZTE has always denied such charges. Most recently, it has drawn attention because it is making a super-cheap smartphone that runs the Firefox OS, based on the web browser. Some think its low price could result in huge sales in emerging markets but, even if it doesn&apos;t, ZTE can offer Android-based handsets to capitalise on the chance. Alibaba Group Alibaba is the reason the US web portal Yahoo may have a negative market value. Yahoo owns a 24% stake in Alibaba, a business-to-business e-commerce company that is used for a huge number of transactions inside China: it is said to be responsible for the contents of 60% of the parcels delivered there, and its Alipay service for about half of online payments in China. Its 2013 revenues were $7.5bn. Alibaba&apos;s decision in September 2013 to seek a US flotation put Yahoo&apos;s stake into sharp focus: its total value could be about $168bn, which would value Yahoo&apos;s stake at $40.3bn. But Yahoo&apos;s market value is just $35bn \u2013 once you subtract the Yahoo Japan business (about $9.3bn worth), the value you&apos;re left with for the US and European business is negative. Obviously, Yahoo could cash out \u2013 but it&apos;s an uncomfortable situation to discover that what was once a tiny investment has outgrown the parent."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/04/england-womens-international-cricket-league-ecb", "sentences": ["Sketchy details of the Women\u2019s International Cricket League, a Twenty20 competition which would theoretically be staged in Singapore, have emerged from Australia over the last couple of months, with the former Southern Stars all-rounder Lisa Sthalekar named as the driving force behind the plans alongside her business partner Shaun Martyn, and a variety of cricket names claimed to be in support including Clive Lloyd, Geoff Lawson and Paul Marsh, who is the head of the Australian Cricketers\u2019 Association."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-04T12:07:59Z", "title": "England will not release players for Women\u2019s International Cricket League", "tags": ["England women's cricket team", "Women's cricket", "ECB", "Cricket", "Twenty20", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "England have increased the rhetoric against plans for a privately run women\u2019s cricket tournament and stressed that they will not be releasing their centrally contracted players to play in it.

Clare Connor, the ECB\u2019s head of women\u2019s cricket and chair of the ICC women\u2019s committee, said: \u201cThere has been a lot of misleading and as yet unsubstantiated information around how far advanced the proposed WICL is. I stress that from an ECB perspective this competition is not on our agenda. \u201cThe immediate focus for international women\u2019s cricket is the ICC International Women\u2019s Championship, which the ICC board approved in January. For the first time ever, the top eight ranked women\u2019s teams in the world will play each other in a bilateral competition, with results determining qualification for the 2017 ICC Women\u2019s World Cup. This is a real game-changer for the women\u2019s game.\u201d She added: \u201cThe ICC and its members do not recognise privately owned tournaments or leagues in the men\u2019s or women\u2019s game. The ICC and the members have made significant investment into women\u2019s cricket over the ten years to create a commercially viable product. In particular there is recognition that a Women\u2019s World Twenty20 every two years will be the vehicle through which to build commercial investment in the women\u2019s game, and it is for the ICC and the members to capitalise on this and take it forward. \u201cAny Twenty20 tournament that features the best players in the world outside ICC competitions would need to be run and controlled by one of the full members, as opposed to by a private operator.\u201d Giles Clarke, the ECB\u2019s chairman who has been a leading advocate of the women\u2019s game, said: \u201cPut simply there is no support or interest for this proposed event. Women\u2019s cricket has made enormous strides in recent years with great investment in the game from the grassroots to the international level. At the same time, thanks to the ICC global events and member investment, we have seen new and exciting players emerge on the world stage. This has to be the continued route for the women\u2019s game, not a privately run competition.\u201d England announced last month that 18 women would receive upgraded contracts, and Australia\u2019s players have also received landmark pay rises in the last two years to allow them full-time status. Martyn had promised payments of around \u00a320,000 per player for a tournament lasting less than two weeks. \u2018\u2018Some of our tier-one players for the tournament will earn $30,000 to $40,000,\u2019\u2019 he told Fairfax Media. \u2018\u2018And that\u2019s only in year one. We have to move that salary cap up each year as we grow the business. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is create an opportunity for women that they don\u2019t have. We want to be able to say to young girls around the world there is actually a career pathway here.\u2019\u2019"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/04/ten-cities-that-made-an-empire-tristram-hunt-review", "sentences": ["&quot;There is a trail of British towns right round the world,&quot; reflects Fogg&apos;s valet in Hong Kong, a city that apparently looked as English as &quot;one of the many market towns in Kent or Surrey \u2026 With a few exceptions, it was Bombay, Calutta, or\u00a0Singapore all over again.&quot; How did this ring of British settlements come into being, and what remains of it today?", "If you looked at the Victorian empire from Singapore, rather than Hong Kong or Melbourne, you would see a city shaped by a single &quot;enlightened despot&quot;, Stamford Raffles \u2013 it remains one of the world&apos;s most international cities."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-04T13:52:00Z", "title": "Ten Cities That Made an Empire by Tristram Hunt \u2013 review", "tags": ["Books", "Tristram Hunt", "Politics", "History", "Culture", "Politics"], "article": "In 1872, that fictional paragon of English efficiency and phlegm, Phileas Fogg, set off from the Reform Club to go around the world in 80 days, armed with nearly unlimited funds from Barings bank and the unflagging confidence of the imperial elite. Travelling on British-owned steamships and British-built railways, he could complete his circuit while scarcely leaving Anglophone territory. &quot;There is a trail of British towns right round the world,&quot; reflects Fogg&apos;s valet in Hong Kong, a city that apparently looked as English as &quot;one of the many market towns in Kent or Surrey \u2026 With a few exceptions, it was Bombay, Calutta, or\u00a0Singapore all over again.&quot; How did this ring of British settlements come into being, and what remains of it today? In Ten Cities that Made an Empire, Tristram Hunt considers the rise and fall of the British empire by touring its centres. It&apos;s an ingenious and timely approach, and one that Hunt, the author of Building Jerusalem and biographer of Friedrich Engels as well as shadow secretary of state for education, is well equipped to\u00a0make. In the 1970s, social history reigned and urban studies proliferated, but such work fell out of fashion with the rise of imperial and cultural history. Hunt&apos;s fusion of the two holds special resonance now, as the &quot;developing&quot; world experiences rates of urbanisation analogous to those of Britain during the Industrial Revolution, and the megacity has become the icon of globalisation in all its good, bad and ugly forms. Hunt skilfully constructs his itinerary to provide a lively and cliche-busting survey of imperial history. He\u00a0begins in three corners of the 18th-century British Atlantic. Bridgetown in\u00a0Barbados surged on the profits of one of the era&apos;s hottest commodities \u2013 sugar \u2013 which was cultivated on the island by armies of African slaves. The more that British and North American consumers gobbled sweets, the more Bridgetown flourished, becoming a planters&apos; playground of &quot;assembly rooms, race courses, musical societies, dancing schools, bowling greens&quot;. One\u00a0could read the city&apos;s debt to transatlantic trade off a map: New England Street, Manchester Lane, the Birmingham Warehouse. Boston, too, was bound to the British empire by commerce, trading North American timber, whale oil and cod, and consuming imported ceramics, silver, sugar and tea. Colonial Boston, as Hunt describes it,\u00a0was a &quot;fiercely royal city&quot; whose denizens were &quot;delighted to be part of Britain&apos;s emergent, Atlantic empire&quot;. Until, of\u00a0course, they weren&apos;t. Hunt uses the\u00a0story of the Boston Tea Party \u2013 essentially an anti-tax protest \u2013 to show how the American revolution was at least as much a conflict about prices and profits as it was about principles. That may also help explain why the American revolution tended, if anything, to reinforce colonial loyalty in other domains. In Dublin, Hunt explains, the Protestant ascendancy strived to &quot;be equal partners in empire, not troublesome colonial cousins&quot; like\u00a0the Americans. The city&apos;s grand Georgian redevelopment, with its fine aristocratic townhouses, its remodelled parliament, its Custom House and the Four Courts, showed how the city &quot;was becoming more, not less, integrated with Britain during this period&quot;. The process culminated in the 1800 Act of Union, which sealed Ireland&apos;s transformation &quot;from a problem to a partner in imperialism&quot; \u2013 at least for a time. The British empire that emerged from the American and French revolutions was characterised by increasing metropolitan control, an assertively Protestant, Anglocentric culture, and a\u00a0global strategic vision. Cape Town, seized during the Napoleonic wars, would be transformed by the British &quot;from a second-tier refreshment station to an axis\u00a0of empire&quot;. In Calcutta, Governor Richard Wellesley stamped out what he saw as a &quot;lax, dissolute world&quot; of &quot;interracial liaisons, drinking and gambling&quot; and built a neoclassical, lion-bedecked temple to &quot;morality and\u00a0pageantry, deference and duty&quot; in\u00a0the form of a monumental new Government House. These civic and strategic ambitions were matched by an economic vision: the doctrine of free trade. To Manchester School ideologues, free\u00a0trade would shape a fairer, more peaceful world. But that wasn&apos;t how the Chinese, among others, experienced it. Hong Kong became a &quot;British&quot; city when British opium traders, angered by Chinese restrictions on drug trafficking, convinced the British government to bombard the\u00a0Qing into\u00a0submission. Given such hostile beginnings, it is little wonder that Hong Kong society remained sharply segregated, its white minority steeped in anti-Chinese prejudice. While Hong Kong was a &quot;monument to \u2026 free trade&quot;, Bombay came to stand for a Victorian ideal of modernity. Hunt perceptively notes parallels between Raj-era Bombay and Joseph Chamberlain&apos;s Birmingham: both cities were transfigured by municipal public works (Florence Nightingale became a relentless advocate for Indian sanitation reform) and by civic philanthropy. And while Bombay echoed late Victorian Birmingham, Melbourne offered an Antipodean reflection of, say, Surrey, with handsome suburbs and a thriving culture of sport fostering a sense of belonging to a &quot;Greater Britain&quot;. Britons built virtually all these cities on hitherto scarcely settled patches of coast. The great exception was New Delhi, Hunt&apos;s penultimate case. In 1911, the British shifted their Indian capital to this historic site, which had been the capital of numerous Indian regimes from the Mahabharata to the Mughals. Appointed to design the latest Delhi was country house architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who disdained every previous style. &quot;&apos;Personally, I do not believe there is any real Indian architecture or any great tradition,&apos;&quot; he\u00a0told his wife. Mughal architecture was &quot;&apos;all tommy rot&apos;. And as for the Hindu tradition, &apos;Hindon&apos;t, I say.&apos;&quot; Delhi, a short documentary made in 1938, pans over Lutyens&apos;s monumental state buildings with a voiceover grandly explaining: &quot;Neither Saracen nor British \u2026 the new Delhi is dynamic, but\u00a0no less inspiring than the old.&quot; The film concludes with a panoramic shot down the processional boulevard of Rajpath, and a sonorous valediction to &quot;the ninth, enduring city, which in the old legend of the Hindustan, would stand and rule forever&quot;. The spectacle uncomfortably reminds one of Albert Speer&apos;s plans for the capital of &quot;the Thousand-Year Reich&quot;. Within less than 10 years, New Delhi had become instead the capital of the Republic of India. What did the Indian officials who moved into these imperial buildings make of their inheritance? Hunt uses the urban lens to terrific effect in assessing the legacies of empire today. In present-day Boston, the city&apos;s long, prosperous connection with Britain has been overwritten by the relentlessly patriotic &quot;Freedom Trail&quot; and caricatures of British tyranny. In Dublin, by contrast, one finds tourist literature busily &quot;marketing the architecture and aesthetic of a colonial, Protestant past&quot; to weekend city-breakers. In Hong Kong, old buildings have been torn down &quot;with\u00a0a\u00a0brutal, rhythmic regularity&quot;, a\u00a0reminder of Britain&apos;s ultimate failure &quot;to &apos;open up&apos; China to the virtues of\u00a0free trade&quot;. Hunt locates perhaps the most complex legacy of empire in Britain itself. He concludes in Liverpool, which in the 19th century prospered thanks to shipping and import-related industries such as sugar refining. When imperial trade dried up after the second world war, so did the city&apos;s business, leaving a blasted landscape of empty docks, shuttered warehouses and neighbourhoods affected by racial tension. The latest plans for urban renewal have turned to China: Liverpool has become &quot;twinned&quot; with Shanghai, and plans have been drawn up to develop a port facility for Chinese imports, and a waterfront complex anchored by the 60-storey &quot;Shanghai Tower&quot;. Are the ghosts of the opium wars making mischief? Hunt could of course have picked numerous other imperial cities and found different stories. If you looked at\u00a0the 18th-century British empire from Freetown, Sierra Leone, rather than Bridgetown, you would discover a remarkable riposte to the Atlantic slave trade in a city built by former slaves, with abolitionist sponsorship. If you looked at the Victorian empire from Singapore, rather than Hong Kong or Melbourne, you would see a city shaped by a single &quot;enlightened despot&quot;, Stamford Raffles \u2013 it remains one of the world&apos;s most international cities. And if you looked at the 20th-century empire from Johannesburg, rather than New Delhi, you would see how tactics of divide-and-rule evolved into a cityscape stamped by appalling policies of white supremacist rule. But such variations are tributes to the richness of Hunt&apos;s approach, and his success at moving beyond &quot;a barren conversation about empire being a &apos;good&apos; or &apos;bad&apos; thing&quot; to &quot;reflect instead on how the processes of imperial exchange took place&quot;. After all, even in its heyday, observers had wildly different views of the empire&apos;s cities. The same year Fogg made his record-setting tour, illustrator Gustave Dor\u00e9 published a\u00a0futuristic engraving of imperial London in ruins \u2013 the dome of St Paul&apos;s collapsed, London Bridge knocked off its foundations, wharves collapsing and overgrown. It may never have been too early to anticipate the empire&apos;s fall \u2013 and it can never be too soon to address the challenges it has left behind. \u2022 To order Ten Cities That Made an Empire for \u00a318 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/05/d-day-veterans-emotional-return-normandy-beaches-70-years-on", "sentences": ["It reminds you of so much,&quot; said Smith, a retired engineer from Newbury, Berkshire, who fought in six countries with the Royal Engineers, ending up in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-05T17:35:44Z", "title": "D-day veterans make emotional return to Normandy beaches 70 years on", "tags": ["D-day", "World news", "France", "Europe", "Second world war", "Military", "UK news"], "article": "Along Normandy&apos;s coastline, simple services were held throughout Thursday. Bugler strains of The Last Post drifted over Sword Beach, the eastern most of the five landing sites, as rheumy-eyed veterans stared out at the sun-kissed expanse of golden sand. How different it was now to then. &quot;It was so smokey, there was so much noise, the noise was really quite terrific,&quot; remembered Ron Rogers, 96, then a captain with &quot;the Suffolks&quot;. &quot;The Germans were shelling, we had a rocket ship to our right. There were houses on fire in front,&quot; he said, surveying the calm sea from his wheelchair as a child piled a toy tractor with sand just yards away from him. Then, he scrambled ashore at 8.30am on 6 June 1944, as German snipers took aim. &quot;An officer was shot just in front of me. We took cover behind a burnt out tank. I tell you, I don&apos;t really remember the casualties because I was too busy trying to get off the beach.&quot; Rogers, a retired insurance broker from Bedford, fought onward and onward until he was wounded on 13 August in a mortar attack, the shrapnel from which he still carries in his back. For him, and the others who have journeyed here, memories were everywhere. Jim Kelly, 91, of the 41 Commandos, found himself alone before his landing craft even reached the shore. Of the seven in his party, &quot;I was the only one standing. They hit the landing craft straight away. How they missed me, I don&apos;t know.&quot; Kelly, a Bren gunner from Liverpool, gave the Kohima Epitaph at a small service to inaugurate a memorial plaque on the beach to the 2nd Battalion the Lincolnshire regiment, alongside whom the commandos fought that day. &quot;It was mayhem,&quot; he recalled. Finding himself alone, he reached the seawall and was starting to cut his way out when he saw his commanding officer. The two managed to make their way to their rendezvous point, and regroup with others who had survived, only then to run into the 21st Panzers. &quot;I was scared most of the time. I had a very hairy day of it,&quot; said Kelly, who was wounded at Wacheren, Holland, in November. When he comes back to Normandy, he brings a wreath for every cemetery wherein lies the body of one of his group of Commandos. &quot;We promised we would do this, until the last man standing,&quot; he said. The cemeteries, immaculately tended as they are, bringing order out of chaos, provide a peaceful resting place for men whose deaths were violent and sudden, said Brigadier David Baines, veteran of Gold Beach, who addressed a simple service to commemorate &quot;the Gunners&quot;, at the Royal Artillery Memorial at La Breche. &quot;I think that is so important to the families,&quot; he said. It&apos;s what has kept Gordon Smith, a Sword Beach veteran from the Royal Engineers 90, coming back. Even though at times he finds it overwhelms him. He sat, eyes welling until tears streamed as The Last Post sounded. Emotions raw, he bowed his head. &quot;Those poor kids, running up the beach,&quot; he said. &quot;Just 18 or 19-year-olds.&quot; He feels ashamed, he explained, because he was forced to hide behind dead bodies. &quot;We were told we had to survive, we had to kill or be killed.&quot; But the memories of those bodies refuse to leave him. &quot;Coming here, it just reminds you. It reminds you of so much,&quot; said Smith, a retired engineer from Newbury, Berkshire, who fought in six countries with the Royal Engineers, ending up in Singapore. Dabbing his eyes with his handkerchief, he added. &quot;We did what we did, what we had to do. This is the final time for me. I am not coming back any more.

On the one hand, Australians\u2019 feelings towards China are as warm as they have ever been in 10 years of Lowy Institute polling. Remarkably, Australians believe that China has as much of a claim to the title of &quot;Australia\u2019s best friend in Asia&quot; as Japan has \u2013 and a greater claim than Singapore, Indonesia, India or South Korea. On the other hand, nearly half (48%) of Australians believe it is likely that China will become a military threat to Australia in the next 20 years. More than half (56%) believe the government allows too much foreign investment from China. And China\u2019s powerful new leader, president Xi Jinping, hardly registers in the Australian public consciousness. When asked to rate a series of world leaders, only 2% of Australians said they admired Xi a lot, and 15% admired him a little. A full 64% did not know of Xi or had no view of him. It is remarkable that so many Australians believe we may soon be threatened militarily by a country that many of us today see as our best friend in Asia. But it is also understandable that Australia and China should not have a complete meeting of the minds. On the one hand, there is much for Australians to admire about China\u2019s development. In the past three decades, China has remade its economy, driven extraordinary productivity increases, and in so doing raised hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. This last achievement should not be ignored by China\u2019s critics. China\u2019s economic growth and its appetite for natural resources has, of course, put a good deal of money into Australians\u2019 pockets in recent years. Increasingly, flows of trade and investment flows are being matched by flows of people, as Australian and Chinese tourists discover each others\u2019 countries. On the other hand, our two countries remain starkly different. There are limits to the level of intimacy that can be achieved between a democracy and a non-democracy. This week\u2019s anniversary of Tiananmen Square is a reminder that internal conditions in China have the potential to derail the bilateral relationship. Furthermore, China\u2019s external behaviour has taken a more assertive turn of late. Last year, China unilaterally announced an air defence identification zone over the East China Sea, provoking strong responses from Australia and other countries. In early February, Chinese warships conducted their first military exercises in the waters immediately to Australia\u2019s north. Given the uncertainty about China\u2019s future behaviour, it makes good sense for us to invest in our alliance with the United States and encourage its &quot;rebalance&quot; towards Asia. But this does not mean we should run down our relationship with China; on the contrary, we should thicken it. What can we do to take the Australia-China relationship to the next level? The strategic partnership delivered by former prime minister Julia Gillard in 2013 was a good start. Australian and Chinese political leaders do not know each other well enough. Now Australian and Chinese leaders are due to hold annual meetings each year and Cabinet-level strategic dialogues on foreign policy and economics are also meant to take place. The Lowy Institute has long argued for this kind of arrangements to build trust between the political elites of the two countries. In April, prime minister Tony Abbott pulled off a successful visit to Beijing. Taking a leaf from John Howard\u2019s book, he stayed away from human rights and focused instead on areas of common interest, in particular economic ties. He was assisted by the professionalism showed by Australian agencies in the search for MH370 \u2013 a topic in which the Chinese leadership is intensely interested. This November, president Xi is due to visit to Australia in November for the G20 Leaders Summit. Hopefully he will stay for longer than the summit, and see more of Australia than Brisbane. When it comes to Asian security, Canberra needs to walk a fine line. We should not get caught up in bilateral disputes in which we cannot make a material difference \u2013 but we should not back off from defending our own interests and values. I have never heard a sinologist say that the one thing the Chinese respect is weakness. The worst thing we could do is lead the Chinese to believe we will pre-emptively downgrade our alliance relationship with Washington in order to curry favour with Beijing. That is never going to happen and any hints to the contrary will only lead to disappointment down the track.  China appreciates clarity and consistency in its relations with other countries, and Australia owes it no less than that."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/06/pope-francis-sacks-vatican-financial-watchdogs", "sentences": ["The others are Swiss philanthropy and non-profit consultant Marc Odendall and Joseph Yuvaraj Pillay, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-06T13:19:48Z", "title": "Pope Francis sacks Vatican financial watchdogs", "tags": ["Pope Francis", "Religion", "Catholicism", "Christianity", "The papacy", "World news", "Pope Benedict XVI", "Vatican", "Business"], "article": "Pope Francis has made his latest break with the past by sacking the entire, exclusively Italian, board of the Vatican&apos;s financial regulator and replacing them with international experts, including a former adviser to George W Bush.

Benedict XVI, who resigned last year, established the AIF in 2010 as part of efforts to bring the Vatican in line with international anti-money-laundering rules. Subsequently, when it became clear it was having difficulty in doing that, the Holy See brought in Ren\u00e9 Bruelhart, a leading anti-money-laundering expert from Switzerland, to be the AIF&apos;s director. &quot;Bruelhart wanted a board he could work with and it seems the pope has come down on his side and sent the old boy network packing,&quot; an unnamed Vatican source told Reuters.

In January, he replaced four of the five cardinals overseeing the so-called Vatican bank, officially known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR).

He is seething, not with the governments of Uganda or Belize, but with the Charity Commission of the UK, which recently denied charitable status to his organisation. On Thursday the trust appealed against the decision; in a beige, totally characterless room on Southampton Row, central London, Michael Beloff QC, acting for the trust, spoke for three hours without stopping, had a sandwich, and spoke for an hour more. The powers of concentration of lawyers are frankly awe-inspiring. Nobody even checked their Facebook page, as far as I could make out, though one man in the observation area did go to sleep. Beloff had eight points, which I can summarise (more or less) in three: the promulgation of human rights was deemed to be charitable in the 2006 Charities Act; that&apos;s what the trust does; therefore the trust is a charity. It was, in short, the most undramatic drama you have ever witnessed, surreally sterile; if the trust loses this appeal, it will have to shut down. It was impossible to conceive, in this atmosphere, how many lives hang on this decision. The work of the trust is this: with very few exceptions (Saudi Arabia is one), most countries are signed up to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which makes it illegal to discriminate against anyone on the basis of their sexual identity. As Cooper said to me three years ago: &quot;This is a matter of law. Once you&apos;re not following the law, you&apos;re undermining the rule of law.&quot; So, with a local activist from any given country, the trust will bring a case against the relevant government for a homophobic law and that case, for all that it will be fiercely contested and appealed against, is pretty much unlosable. It&apos;s a laborious process: a case they brought against the government in Belize (where homosexuality is criminalised in the same statute that makes it illegal to have sex with an animal, and is punishable by up to ten years imprisonment) was heard in May 2013 and still has no outcome. It&apos;s also very secretive \u2013 they work openly in Singapore, Belize and Jamaica, but 80 countries have these oppressive laws, and they do work behind the scenes in many of them. I see Cooper as a kind of maverick legal James Bond, pursuing international bad guys with test-case litigation. That&apos;s only partly an exaggeration because it&apos;s dangerous, maybe not for them, but for the people they represent: &quot;Caleb [Orozco, the activist bringing the Belize case] had a bottle smashed in his face; someone just came up to him in the street. I don&apos;t know how often that&apos;s happened to you in your life,&quot; Cooper said, livid. Acting for the Charity Commission, Kenneth Dibble had put it to him that the people he acts for aren&apos;t real victims, but just activists bringing test cases. &quot;I had to explain that the guy we act for in Jamaica, five policemen set upon him, surrounded by a mob, who tried to kill him. One of his colleagues had already been murdered. It&apos;s absurd.&quot; It is not just business as usual for gay people, in which some countries are more oppressive than others. This is an active battleground, in which homosexuality is used totemically by governments trying to assert nationalistic agendas. So there&apos;s Russia, using anti-homosexual lawmaking as a test of how serious the international community is about enforcing its rules, a sort of sexual Ukraine; there&apos;s Iran, where three men were hanged in 2011 for the crime of lavat (intercourse between men), which again carried an international message, a rejection of &quot;western values&quot; through the medium of the death sentence. Sam Kutesa has just been appointed president of the UN&apos;s general assembly, despite being part of the Ugandan government that signed into law some of the most unpleasant homophobic legislation in the world. Obviously it&apos;s above my pay grade to adjudicate the relevance of the Charities Act, but you don&apos;t need to be a lawyer to say it is a dark and perilous time to be homosexual. The point of view of the Charity Commission is that UK courts are not qualified to adjudicate the legal merits of cases brought against sovereign overseas governments.

The outbound flight was on 9 May, and the email said the route was ending after 5 May. I was asked to call Virgin to have my booking switched to an alternative carrier. But Virgin then told me they were unable to do this and instructed me to request a refund. The Virgin flights cost A$3,243 (\u00a31,800). But as I still needed to travel, I was forced to pay higher ticket prices with an inferior carrier. As a British expat who has lived in the US and Australia for the past decade, I have flown almost exclusively with Virgin, have silver membership of its Flying Club and now feel completely let down. I understand that strategic decisions, such as cancellation of routes, are not taken lightly. But surely, taking payment for services in the full knowledge that you&apos;re not intending to provide them is misrepresentation? I have just got back from the trip to find the refund has still not materialised. Sitting on more than A$3,000 for over 17 weeks is astounding in today&apos;s consumer-led marketplace.  How do I get my money back, and am I entitled to claim interest? AC, Melbourne, Victoria This was a major commercial decision (the route was closed after 10 years as it was deemed unprofitable) and the company would have planned its formal announcement very carefully. There was clearly some sensitivity about the timing, given the inevitable job losses, and the need to consult with unions and staff. But there were implications for passengers, too, and in our view you definitely got a raw deal as you ended up having to book your own, more expensive, substitute flights. The Civil Aviation Authority says that once a flight is cancelled the operator is legally obliged to offer a reroute at the earliest possible opportunity, or give a full refund. If the customer does not receive what he/she is legally entitled to, and they have to book alternative flights, they are entitled to claim the costs back. We contacted Virgin Atlantic and it set about speeding up your refund, apologising for the delay. It has also given you 10,000 Flying Club miles \u2013 redeemable on Virgin Australia and Singapore Airlines, as well as Virgin Atlantic. It said: &quot;We will discuss all options with passengers booked on the services and will look to either offer a full refund or rebook them on to another carrier. In this case we made several attempts to book an alternative flight for AC but were unfortunately unable to do so. We appreciate this led to the passenger needing to pay a higher price for his new flight. We will look at this issue further if he contacts our customer relations team.&quot; We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Woolcott, former head of the Foreign Affairs Department, ambassador to the United Nations and ambassador to Indonesia, said Australia needed clear answers to determine its strategic stance. In an interview with Guardian Australia, he said the former prime minister Malcolm Fraser had \u201craised what should be a major issue\u201d in his book Dangerous Allies, in which Fraser argues Australia should become strategically independent and that the military alliance with the United States could pose a threat rather than a protection, by drawing Australia into regional conflict. \u201cMalcolm Fraser\u2019s questioning of the nature of the alliance is timely \u2026 The alliance is valuable in a number of ways but it is important for Australia, as an ally, to ascertain the precise nature of the US \u2018pivot\u2019 to Asia,\u201d Woolcott said. \u201cWe need to ask the US very clearly what they mean by the pivot and exactly what they expect from us so we can take decisions.\u201d Obama promised the strategic shift towards Asia and the Pacific in a speech to the Australian parliament in November 2011, but the move involves balancing US promises to Asian allies with the risk of antagonising China, and American words and actions are being watched closely to see what it will mean in practice. Deep tensions surfaced earlier this month at the Shangri-La defence dialogue in Singapore where the US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, criticised Chinese aggression in maritime disputes in the region, including deploying an oil drilling platform in waters disputed with Vietnam. The deputy chief of staff of the Chinese military, Lieutenant General Wang Guanzhong, replied that Hagel\u2019s remarks were \u201cfull of hegemony ... full of words of threats and intimidation\u201d. In remarks to a business audience in New York on Tuesday, the prime minister said the rise of China presented a great opportunity and urged the US to remain closely involved in the region. \u201cThe rise of China has been good for the wider world because there are now so many more people to afford to buy what the rest of the world produces,\u201d Abbott said. \u201c ... We should be fundamentally optimistic about the future because these are all people with much to lose if things go wrong \u2026 The Asian century will be an Indian century, a Japanese century, a Korean century and an Indonesian century \u2013 as well as a Chinese one. \u201cThe Asian century will be an American century, too, because America is a Pacific power as well as an Atlantic one. Asia needs America involved. The world wants America to succeed. The world needs America to succeed.\u201d And in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, a former Labor leader and now Australian ambassador to the United States, Kim Beazley, said Americans were \u201cintrigued\u201d by Australia\u2019s ability to balance closer ties with Japan with a good relationship with China. \u201cThey are intrigued by his relationship with the Japanese prime minister and the fact Australia is looking to do more and more with Japan and how he managed to balance that out with quite a reasonable dialogue with China. They think that was a little risk taking by the Australian prime minister \u2026 and he seemed to pull it off, so in their minds that is a plus,\u201d he said. Woolcott, who was appointed by the tormer prime minister Kevin Rudd as a special envoy in Asia, said he believed Fraser\u2019s thesis \u201cdeserves more attention\u201d and that the US would respect an ally that was clear about its views. \u201cI believe Australia\u2019s best interests are served if our reaction avoids us being drawn into anything that appears to be a policy of containment of China,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been to Washington with two Labor and two Liberal prime ministers and I am very confident that while the US would like Australia to comply with what they want, but would expect us to say where we had a different point of view \u2026 The alliance with the United States has led us into three unsuccessful and losing wars where Australia\u2019s interests weren\u2019t really served at all,\u201d he said.

The Cornwall charity has been successfully working with mothers aged under 23 on their health, aspirations and ways to move out of poverty since 1992, but with tight budgets and increasingly high levels of need, had never been able to afford a significant external evaluation. Now Davies is able to cite the award on funding applications, and believes it must have played a role in a new commission the charity has won since December. &quot;There&apos;s a huge kudos attached to it,&quot; Davies says. &quot;It&apos;s had a lot of impact with the partner agencies that we&apos;re likely to be commissioned by. Saying &apos;Guardian award-winning project&apos; always goes down very well because it&apos;s a big external voice saying &apos;this is a quality project&apos;.&quot; The value of increased recognition is a theme that comes up repeatedly among recent winners. &quot;In today&apos;s economic world, with funding cuts and fundraising being increasingly difficult for all charities, raising your profile is tremendously positive,&quot; says Diana Whitmore, chief executive of another 2013 winner, Teens and Toddlers. &quot;It&apos;s absolutely made a difference.&quot; Staff at the charity, which transforms lives by arranging for disadvantaged young people to act as mentors to nursery schoolchildren in need of extra support, have also been delighted by the opportunity to take up free training in subjects including events and leadership. &quot;We were looking into paying for this kind of training, but it&apos;s a minimum of \u00a3350 a day,&quot; says Whitmore. &quot;For a small charity that&apos;s quite an expense if you want four days of training, so the pro bono expertise is a wonderful gift.&quot; At south London&apos;s Wheels for Wellbeing, where disabled and older people are able to discover or rediscover the joys of cycling using one of the charity&apos;s fleet of non-standard cycles, director Isabelle Clement describes the chance to get help with their fundraising strategy from the FSI as &quot;magic&quot;. &quot;We also had a wonderful photographer from the Media Trust help us boost our bank of images which is really important,&quot; she adds. &quot;Of course the five grand [prize money] didn&apos;t go amiss either. We said we&apos;d put that into our burgeoning campaigning work, which we haven&apos;t ever had any funding for, and together with others we&apos;ve now put together an inclusive cycling policy document.&quot; For Jo Rice, managing director at Resurgo, winning a Guardian charity award last year was remarkable for the way it prompted potential corporate partners to get in touch. Resurgo&apos;s challenging six-week programme tackles the barriers that prevent 16 to 24-year-olds getting into work. &quot;There are various businesses we&apos;ve renewed contact with that we&apos;d been talking to for a long time and had perhaps lost touch with,&quot; she says. &quot;There was a sudden renewed interest in what we&apos;re doing.&quot; Existing partners have been impressed too; Rice believes a longstanding donor in Singapore that is now looking at trebling its donations must have been influenced by the accolade. &quot;It&apos;s amazing when you get this kind of recognition,&quot; she adds of the award&apos;s impact on staff. &quot;There&apos;s a huge emotional cost to the work they&apos;re doing so this is hugely beneficial.&quot; At Yorkshire and Humberside Circles of Support and Accountability (YHCOSA), trained volunteers form &quot;circles&quot; meet with a sex offender once a week for around a year, to discuss their offences, concerns and ideas for the future, with the aim of ensuring they don&apos;t reoffend. &quot;The recognition and publicity from [the award] came at a perfect time for us ... when all third sector organisations are trying to survive the economic downturn and organisations working in partnership with probation are trying to keep abreast of the [coalition government&apos;s] changes,&quot; says director Tammy Banks. For a charity working on a shoestring budget and built on the dedication of volunteers prepared to work in one of the most unpopular areas of social welfare, the cash award was also a valuable boost, allowing YHCOSA to organise events for volunteers to share knowledge and celebrate success. &quot;It&apos;s enhanced our ability to value our volunteers and the time, passion and commitment they afford YHCOSA,&quot; Banks says. &quot;They are our magic ingredient \u2013 without them Circles couldn&apos;t run.&quot; How to enter The Guardian charity awards 2014 in association with Zurich, are open for small, social welfare charities that can demonstrate excellence and achievement.

Held up by the high dollar, Australians continue to holiday overseas. The falling confidence may however be having an impact. The growth of Australians going overseas is lower now than it has been at any time since the GFC. The growth of Australians holidaying overseas certainly has come off the boil from the heady days of 2010-2011, when the dollar was worth up to $US1.09 and the annual number of Australians going overseas grew by between 10%-20%. Indeed for the first time this century, the number of international tourists coming to Australia is growing faster than is the number of Australians leaving these shores:       But while the boom of Australians heading OS appears to be peaking, each month there are still many more people leaving our shores for a holiday than foreigners are arriving, and the ratio is as high as it has been for 30 years:       In terms of international tourism, because more Australians are going overseas than international visitors are arriving, we are a net importer of tourism. This sounds a bit confusing, but it is because when you go overseas you are in effect sending money overseas (ie importing) just like you would be were you to buy products from overseas and actually import them to Australia. The Australian Bureau of Statistics doesn\u2019t count how much Australian tourists spend each month when they travel overseas, so we can\u2019t say exactly how much of a tourism importer we are in dollar terms. But given there are about 1.3 departures for every arrival, unless foreigners outspend Australians by that much, then more money is going out than coming in. The reason more people are leaving Australia than are arriving is not due to the drop of foreign tourists, but due to the now 10 years surge of Australians heading abroad:       It\u2019s easy to understand why this has happened when we look at the value of our dollar:       At the end of 2003, our dollar rose to around US$0.75 \u2013 a value not seen since 1997, so not surprisingly Australians thought it was a good time to head overseas. Since then, aside from a blip during 2008-09 due to the GFC, the value of the dollar has remained well above average. So even with the recent fall from over parity with the US dollar, we\u2019re still very much in unusual waters. But while our appetite for travelling overseas has grown, where we travel has changed over the years. We have become slightly less predictable. In 1991 the top five destinations of New Zealand, United States, UK, Indonesian and Hong Kong constituted 55% of all overseas travel. Now the top destinations (the same as in 1991 except Thailand has replaced Hong Kong) account for 48%. The big growth destinations have been India, China and Vietnam. In 1992 just 2.2% of overseas travel was to those nations; in the past year it was 10%:       The change in our travel habits becomes more apparent when we look at areas rather than specific countries. Over the past 20 years travelling to New Zealand, Fiji and other areas of Oceania have become less popular. It still remains our most common destination, but whereas in 1991 25% of travel was to those countries, now it is 20%. Other areas to become less popular are north-west Europe, which has fallen from 16% to 10.8% of travel, and North America. In 1991, 16% of Australians\u2019 travel was to the USA or Canada, now it is 12%. But the big growth area overall is south-east Asia. It has gone from comprising 22% of travel to now just over 31%.       Even within these areas change has occurred. In 1991, the UK accounted for two-thirds of travel to north-west Europe, now it is just 56%, whereas both Ireland and France have become more common. And similarly in 1991, nearly 60% of those travelling to south-east Asia were headed to either Indonesia or Singapore. Since then, Indonesia has retained its popularity, but Vietnam and Thailand have risen at the expense of Singapore. Where we travel is clearly influenced by safety. The percentage of Australians venturing to Indonesia (or Bali, really) has been high for decades (Redgum wrote \u201cI\u2019ve Been to Bali Too\u201d in 1984). But its popularity has taken a number of dips \u2013 first due to the political upheaval in 1998-99, then the Bali bombings first in October 2002 and then in 2005:       It has recovered to now be as popular a destination for Australians as it ever was. Whether Egypt will recover from the turbulence there since the Arab spring in 2010 remains to be seen. As yet, Australians are less likely to go there than they have ever been:       But I must admit at this point that looking at overseas travel data always gives me pangs of envy. While friends and family of mine have been among this surge of Australians venturing abroad to reap the benefits of the high Australian dollar, the last time I went overseas was to the United States in July 2001, when the dollar was worth 50 US cents! But never fear, holidaying in Australia remains a joy, and perhaps something we should all do more of.       Since 2000, and the Sydney Olympics, the importance of tourism in the economy has steadily declined. It is perhaps the industry most affected by the high dollar. And given just under 5% of all Australian workers are employed in tourism, it\u2019s an industry where our travel choice has a direct impact.

With sales at its stores in freefall, the company&apos;s executive chairman, Godfrey Davis said it would take time to win back British shoppers who were alienated by the Somerset brand&apos;s change of direction. &quot;This is a medium term project,&quot; he said. &quot;We have been dealing with inherited issues but we are making progress and expect to see some of the benefits coming through in the second half (of the financial year) and more next year.&quot; Davis is clearing up the mess left behind by Bruno Guillon, the French chief executive ousted in March. Guillon had sought to propel the brand into the luxury elite alongside the likes of Prada and Gucci by selling bags that cost over \u00a31,000, rather than the cheaper ones that were in saving up distance of many British customers. The gung-ho approach backfired, with the company forced to issue a series of profits warnings as sales dried up in the important middle market. The annual results revealed Guillon, a former Herm\u00e8s executive, received a \u00a3648,000 pay off. Sales had collapsed, Davis said, because Mulberry had lacked &quot;new and interesting&quot; products in the key \u00a3500 to \u00a3800 price range. &quot;The evidence is this sort of price point is important globally,&quot; he said. Like rivals Louis Vuitton and Gucci, Mulberry is struggling to compete against more accessible, trendy fashion brands such as Michael Kors, which give customers the look and feel of luxury at a fraction of the price. The Mulberry design team has turned its attention to this area and last month saw the launch of the new Tessie range, which with a small satchel priced at \u00a3495 and a tote costing \u00a3595, is &quot;proving popular&quot; according to Davis. Other initiatives include a collaboration with model Cara Delevingne which feature a bag inspired by her lion tattoo. It remains early days, though, with like-for-like sales down 15% in the last 10 weeks. In a &quot;sale&quot; on the Mulberry website, prices have been slashed to \u00a3770 from \u00a31,100 for many classic Bayswater, Alexa and Del Rey bags. The company said recruiting a creative director to replace the highly regarded Emma Hill, who quit last year, was a priority. &quot;Once we have settled the creative director appointment we will look for a new chief executive,&quot; Davis said. Hill is credited with some of its bestselling bag designs such as the Alexa \u2013 a satchel named after presenter Alexa Chung \u2013 and the Del Rey, dedicated to singer Lana Del Rey \u2013 and it has struggled in her absence. Erdem, Roland Mouret, Mary Katrantzou and Sophie Hulme are among the fashion designers linked to the role in the fashion press. Warwick business school professor Qing Wang said last year&apos;s move upmarket &quot;appeared not to have been thought through&quot;. He said: &quot;It seems to me that the management of Mulberry failed to understand that even with the right ingredients that Mulberry possesses such as fine material, craftsmanship and a &apos;made in Britain&apos; label, the making of a true luxury good requires time and process to distil. The latest knee-jerk reaction to reduce prices will only add to the confusion in the mind of the consumers of the company&apos;s brand image as to whether it&apos;s an affordable luxury like Coach or an exclusive luxury like Burberry.&quot; Created in 1971 in Somerset, Mulberry is named after the tree which founder Roger Saul walked past each day in the grounds of his school. Davis said the brand, which is now 56% owned by Singapore billionaires Christina Ong and Ong Beng Seng, still stood for &quot;modern Englishness&quot; and that it was going back to its roots of providing people with &quot;everyday, practical and beautiful things&quot;. It was possible, he said to appeal to both the middle classes and the super rich, with a Paris flagship shop set to open next year. Davis admitted in April that introducing cheaper bags would hit sales and profits in the short term, but insisted this was necessary to revive the Mulberry brand. Profits crashed to \u00a314m in the year to 31 March from \u00a326m the previous year, partly caused by costs related to opening nine new international stores. The company also built a second UK factory last June where it created 320 new jobs.

Angry Birds Epic, released globally today for Android, iOS and Windows Phone devices, represents the series move into a new genre: roleplaying games (RPGs). However, it is also the latest effort by publisher Rovio to capitalise on the &quot;free-to-play&quot; business model that now dominates the mobile games industry. It&apos;s Rovio&apos;s second Angry Birds game built from the start as a free-to-play title that explores a new genre, following racing game Angry Birds Go, which launched in December 2013. Angry Birds Epic has been available in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore since mid-March, as Rovio used early player feedback to hone the game and its system of in-app purchases. The game adopts a turn-based RPG format, with players taking a team of birds into battle with their pig enemies, levelling their characters up while acquiring and upgrading weapons, armour and potions along the way. It&apos;s free to download and play, but an in-app shop sells virtual coins, which can be spent on items and other gameplay features. The costs range from \u00a30.69 for a &quot;pouch&quot; of 15 coins to \u00a359.99 for a &quot;Mighty Eagle&apos;s Treasure Chest&quot; of 3,000 coins. That marks Angry Birds Epic out as a game for adults, but the franchise&apos;s popularity with children may cause concern among parents about its highest tiers of in-app purchase \u2013 just as the option to pay \u00a369.99 for a &quot;Big Bang Special Edition&quot; car in Angry Birds Go&apos;s beta sparked questions last year.     Angry Birds Epic's in-app coins store.    Rovio&apos;s early Angry Birds games were paid titles, bought with a single upfront purchase. Over time, the company diversified by adding in-app purchases, as well as building a thriving business in toys, merchandise and other licensed products. Even so, Angry Birds&apos; growth has paled next to the money being made by free-to-play games like Candy Crush Saga and Clash of Clans on smartphones and tablets. Rovio&apos;s financial results for 2013 revealed revenues of \u20ac156m (\u00a3128.4m) compared to $1.9bn (\u00a31.1bn) for Candy Crush developer King and $892m (\u00a3529.6m) for Clash of Clans maker Supercell. Angry Birds fans will be less concerned with Rovio&apos;s business, and more interested in whether Angry Birds Epic is a good game. &quot;The Angry Birds characters are a perfect fit for a role-playing game because they have strong personalities and individual superpowers. They are almost like character classes from the get go,&quot; said Rovio&apos;s executive vice president of games Jami Laes, in a statement. RPG purists may scoff, but early indications are that the blend of birds and battles works well. A couple of hours&apos; playing this morning revealed a well-crafted introduction to the game&apos;s features, plenty of slapstick humour, and the makings of an interesting system for crafting weapons. The real test will come further into the game, as it becomes clear how aggressively the in-app purchases are pushed, and how the game&apos;s various virtual currencies interlock.

Aimed more at girls and women, that game will be released in September, alongside new toys, merchandise, books and cartoons. \u2022 Angry Birds: Rovio talks free-to-play, Stella and ToonsTV"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/12/mortgage-loans-capped-bank-england-george-osborne", "sentences": ["Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore are examples of other countries which have taken steps to cool their housing market."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-12T17:38:20Z", "title": "Mortgage loans to be capped by Bank of England \u2013 but why?", "tags": ["Bank of England", "Mortgage rates", "Financial policy committee", "George Osborne", "Banking", "Politics", "Business", "Property", "Mortgages", "Banks and building societies", "Money", "House prices", "UK news"], "article": "What is George Osborne doing? The chancellor is saying that he will give the Bank of England the power to cap the size of mortgage loans as a share of a borrower&apos;s income or the value of the house. Why is George Osborne doing this now? Is it because there is a house price bubble?  Several months of headlines about runaway house prices have forced the chancellor into action. According to Nationwide prices have passed their previous peak while other indices are all showing sharp rises. London has been driving the boom, with an average annual price rise of 18%, but there are increasing signs that buyers are having to stretch themselves to buy in other parts of the country too. The International Monetary Fund has been scrutinising the housing market in the UK and called on the Bank of England to act &quot;early and gradually&quot; to avoid a housing bubble. Among the concerns of the IMF is that policymakers are also facing the prospect of having to sanction a first rise in interest rates in almost six years \u2013 a move which could put additional pressure on borrowers who have been enjoying low mortgage rates. How much are people borrowing at the moment as a proportion of how much they earn? According to the Council of Mortgage Lenders, first-time buyers are typically borrowing 3.4 times their household income to get on the housing ladder, while movers are taking on loans of just over three times their salary. That&apos;s the median \u2013 so half are borrowing more. And the average disguises big regional differences: in London the median is 3.8 times salary, while in Northern Ireland it is 2.9. Some borrowers have been taking loans that are more than five times their salary. Around 2.6% of Royal Bank of Scotland&apos;s lending in London is at more than five times salary and above \u00a3500,000. Figures from the Bank of England show that in the first three months of 2014 almost 12% of lending was based on four or more times a single income, and 27% was based on three or more times joint earnings. How much are people borrowing at the moment compared to the value of their homes? Loan to values \u2013 the proportion of a property&apos;s cost that the borrower takes as a mortgage \u2013 have been creeping up but remain below the levels seen in the mid-90s and the run-up to the last crash. The median LTV among first-time buyers now stands at 83%. In London, LTVs are lower than the national average because of the monthly cost of repaying a big loan. New buyers in London typically borrow just 75%. Aren&apos;t there already new rules to stop people borrowing too much? Yes \u2013 since April banks and building societies have been required to carry out tough checks before they offer mortgages to prevent a return to the reckless lending seen in the run-up to the crash. These involve scrutinising applicants&apos; income and outgoings \u2013 including in some cases what they spend on evenings out \u2013 and checking that loans can still be afforded if interest rates rise. However the mortgage market review, as it&apos;s called, did not set a limit on income multiples, and borrowers have still been able to borrow high income multiples. Haven&apos;t banks been easing back on lending already? Lloyds Banking Group was the first to raise the alarm about house prices in London by capping applications for mortgages of more than \u00a3500,000 at no more than four times a borrower&apos;s salary. RBS followed shortly afterwards. Who is George Osborne giving the new powers to? The Financial Policy Committee, was set up by the coalition government in response to the 2008 banking crisis, which in turn exposed a lack of forward thinking by policymakers about the risks to the financial system. It is chaired by the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney and charged with monitoring risks to the financial system and taken steps to remove those risks. What powers does the FPC have already? Until now the FPC has been able demand that banks (via their regulators) hold more capital in general and also specifically against three sectors \u2013 residential loans, commercial property lending and financial institutions. It has also been able to make recommendations about the way banks are lending in terms of the value of mortgages compared to borrowers&apos; income or value of their home. It also monitoring the Help to Buy scheme set up to make it easier to get a home loan. Does the FPC want this power? When it was first asked about the tools it would like to able to control the markets two years ago, the committee rejected asking for this power because it felt there needed to be more debate about the way it could intervene in the markets. What other countries give their regulators such powers? Last year banks in New Zealand were forced to restrict new lending to customers with small deposits, in a move that made it more difficult to get a mortgage with less than a 20% downpayment on a home. Mark Carney has experience from Canada where he ran the central bank until a year ago and steps were taken to cool the housing market by forcing borrowers to pay off their mortgages over a shorter time scale. Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore are examples of other countries which have taken steps to cool their housing market. In Switzerland, the banks have been forced to hold more capital against mortgages. How quickly can it use the new power being handed to it by the chancellor? The next quarterly meeting of the FPC takes place next week. It is scheduled to announce what decisions it has taken on 26 June when there were already expectations that it would take steps to take the some of the heat out of the mortgage market. But it is not expected that it will decide to use the new power to limit the size of a mortgage as a share of a borrower&apos;s income or the value of the house yet because policy makers do yet think there is a systemic risk from the housing market. How did the market get into this state? After the 2008 banking crisis, the mortgage market came to a halt as confidence dried up, the economy deteriorated and lenders found it difficult to raise the money to pass on to borrowers. A series of measures were introduced to try to get the home loans flowing again. The FPC has already forced the government to modify the funding for lending scheme so that it could no longer support lending for homes and instead be focused on small businesses. The concern of politicians \u2013 and policy makers \u2013 is to ensure these are not storing up problems, and creating a new set of problems for the financial system."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/jun/13/starbucks-wireless-charging", "sentences": ["Nintendo executives &quot;seem to think that the issue is the lack of games,&quot; Amir Anvarzadeh, a BGC Partners analyst in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television today."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-13T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: Starbucks wireless charging, Kindle limits?, a cabbie explains\u2026", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google"], "article": "A burst of 8 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Starbucks starts rolling out wireless phone chargers nationwide &gt;&gt; The Verge  The deal is a major victory for Powermat and the Power Matters Alliance, which remains embroiled in a standards war with the Wireless Power Consortium, purveyor of the Qi charging standard.

Ink-spewing squids won&apos;t save Nintendo&apos;s Wii U &gt;&gt; Businessweek  Nintendo&apos;s announcement at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles didn&apos;t really tackle the basic problem the gaming-console pioneer faces: Nintendo&apos;s customers are giving up on the Wii.\u00a0Unlike the PlayStation and the Xbox, Nintendo&apos;s Wii has long catered to younger users who like the company&apos;s cartoon characters, most notably Mario. As the cost of smartphones and tablets continues to fall, however, parents are less willing to fork over several hundred dollars for a Nintendo Wii U when they can instead let Junior play a few online games, often for free, on a cheap Android device. Nintendo executives &quot;seem to think that the issue is the lack of games,&quot; Amir Anvarzadeh, a BGC Partners analyst in Singapore, told Bloomberg Television today. However, &quot;the real issue here is that Nintendo is focusing on the casual gamers, [while] the gamers are migrating to smartphones and tablet platforms where games are free.&quot;  Nintendo, you have a problem. Totally Failing London &gt;&gt; the cabbies capital Black cab driver RJ Cudlip:   Let me just explain one little bit of Taxi/PH [private hire] law first; as a Taxi driver (because of the extra training that allows me to accept instant hails) I am allowed to take bookings direct, unlike a PH driver who must accept a booking from a PH Operator like Addison Lee. This is why what Hailo do (connect me to a punter direct) is within the law and what Uber do isn&apos;t. As previously stated, PH cars are not allowed to make themselves &quot;available for immediate hire&quot; and again, this is what Uber are doing and therefore breaking the law. Then there is the issue of their &quot;virtual meter&quot;. The law states that a PH vehicle is not allowed to be equipped with a meter. Uber, with TfL&apos;s blessing, argue that a smartphone isn&apos;t a meter. I think most right minded people would think that if it does the same thing as a meter, then it most probably is a meter. And an important point here is that Taxis are made to have meters fitted to protect the public from being ripped off.  \u2026There are also issues around Uber not asking for destinations (required by law) and Uber not having an operating center in the UK, but in Holland. This final point seems to be the only one that TfL are admitting is a problem and that if they&apos;d known about it before may not have issued their operator licence! \u2026what Uber and Hailo really want is to take a big cut of the multi billion pound taxi market. Do they have drivers interests at heart? Definitely not. Do they even have customers interests at heart? Almost certainly not. What they really want is to resell my work to me for a fee. Isn&apos;t technology wonderful?  How Apple TV might disrupt Microsoft and Sony &gt;&gt; stratechery by Ben Thompson  Beyond the fact most of us had nothing better to do in the 1980s, a big reason to own a gaming console was that they were a phenomenally good deal. In 1985 Nintendo introduced the Famicom to North America as the Nintendo Entertainment System for a mere $199, an remarkably low price considering the average PC cost around $2,400.1 While PC prices soon began to fall, the Playstation/Nintendo 64 generation was still nearly $1,500 cheaper than the average PC. Over the last two generations of consoles, however, prices have actually risen, and today a Playstation 4 or Xbox One is nearly the same price as an average PC. In some respects, this makes no sense: why hasn&apos;t Moore&apos;s law had the same impact on consoles as it has had on PCs? Moreover, when you consider that consoles now compete with a whole host of new time-wasters like phones, tablets, social networks, dramatically expanded TV offerings, the Internet, etc., it&apos;s downright bizarre. I think the answer lies in a specific part of disruption theory. Specifically, incumbents are driven by their best customers to add more and more features that drive up the price, causing the incumbents&apos; product to move further and further away from the average customer&apos;s needs (needs which have actually been decreasing as more entertainment options become available):  Once that happens, all sorts of strange things become possible. And why not an Android TV that could serve gamers? Though of course Sony already seems to have thought of this.

As a result, messages have been streaming in from around the world congratulating me for having won the bet. However, I think this is premature. I am disappointed that Professor Warwick, with whom I agree on many things, would make this statement. There are several problems that I describe below, including a transcript of a conversation that I had with Eugene Goostman, the chatbot in question.  This is going to be a great disappointment to all the imaginary 13-year-old Ukrainian boys with passable English who are rude about their female classmates. Leap Motion Bone API: Helping computers understand the human hand &gt;&gt; CITEWorld  One Reddit user built a program with Leap Motion&apos;s to browse articles with one-finger swipes left and right, or upvote articles with two finger motions. Though, in watching his video, other than the novelty, it&apos;s tough feel a huge improvement over using a mouse and keyboard. But on the other hand, it&apos;s hard not to think of an extremely rudimentary version of the screens in Minority Report. Time will tell. Leap Motion has been pushing the next generation of its tracking software, improving motions like touching one finger to another hand, or pinching two fingers together. Those seem like simple motions. But if a game requires a player to, say, pick up a ball and throw it, the sensors require incredible precision to know the exact moment the player&apos;s hand would have wrapped around and made a grip on the sphere - not to mention when they&apos;ve released it.  Leap Motion is clever, but still very much a technology desperately seeking an application.

The following visualizations use data captured from these feeds for the entire month of February, 2014. Also, working with the MBTA, we were able to acquire per-minute entry and exit counts at each station measured at the turnstiles used for payment.

He sits at the kitchen table, dizzy with fever, while she ladles broth into a bowl the size of a baby&apos;s bath, imploring him to eat. She turns her back, all the time continuing her monologue about the restorative powers of broth, and thus not witnessing the moment when he faints face down in the soup, thrashes for a\u00a0moment and then falls still. She turns around, witnesses what has occurred and shrieks the immortal line: &quot;Oh my gawd! Levy&apos;s drowned in his chicken soup!&quot;     'Fire, softness and a big slap of umami': C&R's Singapore Laksa. Photograph: Katherine Rose for the Observer    I was reminded of this scene while sitting in a Malaysian caf\u00e9, tucked down an alleyway in London&apos;s Soho, before a huge bowl of laksa, as my own cold kicked in. There was more than enough for me to drown in here and, frankly, I didn&apos;t think it would be that bad a way to go. Laksa is one of the great dishes of the East Asian repertoire: a massive coconut-milk soup, shiny with orange chilli oil, holding ribbons of rice noodles, fat prawns, crinkly-skinned tablets of tofu and those gloriously over-processed fish balls that turn up across the region. I&apos;ve eaten appalling versions and good versions, over-sweetened ones and dishes which are nothing of the sort, but which contain some thickened, vaguely spiced coconut-based sauce to excuse the abuse of the name. The one served here, at C&amp;R Caf\u00e9, goes straight to the top of my laksa list. It&apos;s a little sweet, but not so that your teeth ache. There is fire and softness and a big slap of umami. And all for \u00a36.50. It should be available from the NHS on prescription. I was directed to C&amp;R \u2013 apparently the letters are the initials of the manager&apos;s aunt and uncle \u2013 by a\u00a0Malaysian friend who was bubbling with pride at the MasterChef victory of Malaysian-born Ping Coombes. It was, she said, a joy to see the dishes of her homeland taken so seriously. I had to agree. I watched Coombes advance through the competition, frustrated that she wasn&apos;t one of the competitors the week I was judging. I asked my friend where I could go in London to try the real thing. (Or at least what she regarded as the real thing; I suspect every Malaysian will have their own version, depending on how their mother cooked.) And so she sent me down Rupert Court, an alleyway off the south end of Chinatown. (There is a glossier C&amp;R Restaurant in Westbourne Grove, the older sibling to this place, but who needs gloss?) After my laksa epiphany I decided to investigate the menu further and returned on a Saturday night to find a queue snaking down the alley. No, of course they don&apos;t take bookings. It&apos;s a simple place of wipe-down tables, with grey-painted walls on one side to soften the blinding white, and some rough-hewn stone cladding on the other. Service is no nonsense; you don&apos;t come here to be looked after or liked. This has the virtue of pushing the queue through. They also have an annexe on the other side of the alley for when business is brisk. Which is most of the time.     Spice of life: Malaysia's national dish nasi lemak.

If ever you want to challenge some knuckle-dragging closet racist about their views on immigration \u2013 &quot;I&apos;m not a racist, but I know who I don&apos;t like&quot; \u2013 send them here. Malaysian food is a glorious tribute to the mixing of the many. It is the sum of all its influences: of Chinese, Indian, Thai and a few other traditions besides. And yet it is also itself \u2013 a unique flavour that emerges from out of what the fearful dismiss as cacophony. It is better for what each different culture brings. Witness the famed roti canai \u2013 flaky, oily griddled breads that recall Indian paratha, but with a chillified dipping broth which places them elsewhere in Asia. They leave you licking slicks of salty oil from your fingertips and crying out for more. From the other side of the equation is archar awak, a crunchy salad of pickled vegetables with sesame seeds and peanuts and just a hint of chilli that cuts through the fat of the bread. Then comes the beef rendang. I&apos;ve tried versions of this before which to me seemed little different from a Thai massaman, a big, dark soupy sweet and hot meaty curry. Here, it is something else \u2013 the highly spiced meat braised and then cooked down and down until dry; until the meat is beginning to crisp and caramelise; until the myriad spices are beginning to form a holy crust. It is compelling. It demands to be finished even though you know it will stay on your breath for days. As I eat I find myself thinking about the pan in which it was cooked, and the thick, crunchy rubble that must have been left on the bottom. I dream about scraping away at that crust with a wooden spoon. There are other pleasures: a soupy seafood stir-fry with slippery coils of thin rice vermicelli, in a sauce heavy with black pepper that&apos;s the colour of night; some green beans and fat prawns tossed with chillies in a wok. But both of these bend the knee to the nasi lemak (a version of which Ping Coombes made in the MasterChef final). This, the Malaysian national dish, is in truth a compendium. In the middle is a tian of rice slow-cooked in coconut milk. Around it is a light chicken curry, a pile of roasted peanuts still in their crimson skins, plus a kindling of tiny dried, salted fish, with a slightly woody texture that gives way to crunch. And, of course, there is a puddle of thick sambal, the extraordinary Malaysian condiment made with chillies, shrimp paste, garlic, ginger, sugar and lime\u2026 you know, all the good things. A spoonful of nasi lemak is a variation of these flavours in whichever order you like. There is no dessert menu, which is good for we have over-ordered and are done. A ginger juice drink, with a proper fiery kick, settles me beautifully. But there remains a sense of loss. The menu is long. I&apos;ve only tried half a dozen things. It remains unexplored territory. Oh well. It seems I am only just getting started. Jay&apos;s news bites \u25a0 When it comes to Malaysian food in London, the old Chinatown stalwart Rasa Sayang deserves to be acknowledged. Its picture-led menu includes Singapore chilli crab, a dish which, when done well, is a six-napkin job (rasasayangfood.com). An honourable mention also goes to Noodle Express, an Asian caf\u00e9 in Farringdon. For the most part it serves standard Chinese takeaway staples, but its laksa is an\u00a0 impressive affair. \u25a0 The marvellous Rosie Sykes (right), last seen cooking at Fitzbillies in Cambridge, is joining forces with her old friend Thomas Blythe for a one-night residency at Mayfields in Hackney on 22 June. Blythe is better known for his brilliance front of house. He was general manager at St John and now runs the show at Merchants Tavern. However, he first trained on the other side of the kitchen door. Diners should expect to be well fed (mayfieldswiltonway.co.uk). \u25a0 Reasons to despair: a survey by sustainable agriculture group Linking Environment and Farming (Leaf) found 19% of British people did not know this country grows apples.

The first dreaded wave of tiredness. The warm, soporific effect of eating too much comotosing curry and watching too little goalmouth action finally took effect. Logging off. Lights out. A heady dream took hold. Gone were the wayward crosses, mistimed tackles and poor first touches and, instead, O Fiver\u00e3o conjured a slow-mo mirage of Shola Ameobi coming off the Nigeria bench, nutmegging Ashkan Dejagah and firing into the roof of the net. Goal! Goaaaaal! Goaaaaaaaal! Of course, that\u2019s the great thing about dreams. You can make just about any old codge up, and nobody can do a thing about it. Making them come true is the tricky part, unless you\u2019re from the US, of course. After all, the American Dream is the cornerstone of their society. It\u2019s that Martin-Luther-King-Jr-rags-to-riches-land of opportunity-J\u00fcrgen-Klinsmann-persuading-you-not-to-play-for-the-country-of-your-birth stuff. Berlin-born John Anthony Brooks is a dreamer, and not just because he gets to play for USA! USA!! USA!!! in the World Cup. And if O Fiver\u00e3o hadn\u2019t passed out early and stayed up to watch the late kick-off last night, we\u2019d have seen Brooks\u2019s dreams come true. Quite literally. Having never played an official game for USA! USA!! USA!!!, the 21-year-old centre-back came off the bench to score an 86th-minute winner against Ghana. And yet only two days earlier, he dreamt it would happen. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d said Brooks after the game. \u201cI said I had a dream, I told some team-mates that I dreamed that I had scored in the 80th minute and we won the game. Now it [turned out to be] the 86th minute and we won the game, so that was good.\u201d While Brooks might want to get a couple of new superlatives to describe realising an incredibly unlikely prophecy, his is a remarkable story, made better by the fact that he correctly dreamt that his goal would be from a corner. Never has \u2018living the dream\u2019 meant more in a USA! USA!! USA!!!-Ghana World Cup Group G match. With any luck tonight, Russia v South Korea will again send O Fiver\u00e3o into the deepest of sleeps. Hopefully more Shola-shaped dreams await, all to the soundtrack of Livin\u2019 Joy.

Not because he fears Holland\u2019s next opponents could ruin his country\u2019s sudden feelgood factor \u2013 the next opponents are the Culturalstereotyperoos, for goodness\u2019 sake \u2013 but because he fears he may have to watch the destruction of Australia from down under \u2026 and all because of those thoughtless Brazilian stadium builders. It\u2019s one thing taking a mountain of money to erect vast international sport palaces while leaving the hoi polloi to get their education from vermin and their life-saving operations from cut-price bicycle repair shops, but ignoring schools and hospitals while using a mountain of money to erect vast international sport palaces in which the dugouts are below pitch level really does take the biscuit. \u201cIn the middle of the pitch there is a cameraman who deprives me of the view, and with me all the coaches and managers sitting in the ground, because we are dug under rather than dug out,\u201d bawled Van Gaal of the Estadio Beira-Rio, the scene of Holland\u2019s 4-0 victory today. The Dutchman then spelled out exactly what hardship that brings: \u201cThat obliges us to stand up. I\u2019m a sitting-down coach, not a standing-up coach,\u201d he sobbed. Van Gaal then joked that he may have to get himself a barstool but the Fiver would much prefer if he just sat in the assigned dugout \u2013 and used a periscope. Failing that, a tennis umpire\u2019s chair would surely be more useful than a barstool. Or, even better, Van Gaal could monitor proceedings while perched on the back of an elephant. As far as the Fiver knows, there is nothing in Fifa\u2019s laws of the game that forbids managers from watching matches on elephant-back so if Van Gaal does not do so, it can only be down to conservatism. We have to ask ourselves, then: does this prude really have what it takes to be a world champion? Elsewhere in Group B today, Spain will attempt to piece together the dignity that was shattered by the 5-1 defeat to the Dutch.

In the days before Panini, when football cards were an enticement to procure bubble gum, to keep punters interested the number of cards printed per player was inversely proportional to the popularity-skill quotient of the player. As one could not identify the specific player on the card accompanying said bubble gum until money had changed hands, one was invariably left with dozens of spare \u2018Pat Crerands\u2019, which were impossible to swap with one\u2019s mates for the desired \u2018Roger Hunt\u2019.

Her name is Darysina and even to an uneducated eye she is something special. Standing quietly next to a paddock gate she is sleek, muscular and even tempered. She oozes quality. But what has Brown so excited isn&apos;t simply the four-year-old mare&apos;s classy pedigree, her record on the field or her cost \u2013 \u20ac800,000 (\u00a3640,000) at auction in December. No. What makes Darysina so precious is the foal she is carrying. In March, after her DNA was comprehensively analysed, she was introduced to the charms of Frankel \u2013 the greatest and most successful thoroughbred in modern racing history. Frankel is the superstar of horses. He was unbeaten in his 14-race career, is worth more than \u00a3100m and his genes are so valuable that his owners charge \u00a3125,000 for a quick roll in the hay.     The first Frankel foal sold at public auction for \u00a31.5m. Photograph: Dan Abraham/racingfotos.com/Rex Features    Last week, his first foal to be sold at public auction was snapped up for \u00a31.15m. Any wealthy owner aiming to produce a quality thoroughbred would consider Frankel as a suitor, but Brown didn&apos;t want to leave anything to chance. His decision to use him only came after he had consulted a British company that screens equine genes to find the best possible match. Looking at the DNA of horses to find good breeding stock may seem obvious, but it goes against centuries of tradition in this most conservative of sports where suspicion of applied molecular genetics is rife. The Jockey Club insists on gene tests to confirm parentage, but bans the use of cloned horses \u2013 even though in 2012 the International Federation for Equestrian Sports announced that clones would be allowed to compete in future Olympic Games. Indeed, breeding decisions are made almost entirely by studying pedigree \u2013 the records of bloodlines and race results that go back generations. But Philip Brown isn&apos;t a typical owner. A former science correspondent of the Daily Express in the 1960s, he made his fortune in science publishing. He is sometimes called the wealthiest ex-journalist in Britain and is fascinated, and knowledgeable, about molecular genetics. He was aware that pedigree can be a poor guide to quality: an ancestor five generations back contributes 3% of an animal&apos;s DNA. The Green Monkey is a classic example of the dangers of relying on bloodlines. In 2006 the bay two-year-old colt with an impeccable pedigree sold at auction for $16m \u2013 the highest price of a publicly auctioned thoroughbred. It ran just four times and failed to win once. &quot;I&apos;m a scientist and I have a belief in science,&quot; says Brown. &quot;So if you say there&apos;s a genetic reality to all this, you ought to apply the rules of genetics. It makes sense.&quot; Over the last three years, Brown has worked closely with Dr Stephen Harrison, a geneticist whose Canterbury-based company, Thoroughbred Genetics Limited, creates genetic profiles of horses. The company, founded in 2000, was the first in the world to offer DNA screening for racehorse performance. Over the last decade, Harrison and colleagues have used whole genome analysis from thousands of animals to identify markers linked to equine stamina, strength, respiratory system and energy use. He claims Thoroughbred Genetics&apos; techniques are 75% better than conventional non-genetic methods of choosing winners from a group of horses. Its methods give animals a performance profile based on an analysis of 750 genetic markers. The tests generate cluster graphs that indicate whether or not a horse is best suited to be a sprinter, a long-distance athlete or something in between. By comparing the analyses of mares and stallions, it is possible to get a clue where any progeny will fall in the chart. The tests also show the level of inbreeding in a horse. We&apos;re used to thinking of inbreeding as a problem. After all, it led to blood disorders in the royal families of Europe in the early 20th century and hip problems in German shepherd dogs. But sometimes a degree of inbreeding can be beneficial. One of the most striking examples of this is the 90 Chillingham cattle of Northumbria, thought to be descendants of medieval cattle. They are so inbred that calves are almost genetically identical to their parents. Yet despite the narrow gene pool, the Chillingham cattle are thriving. In 2001 a study in Nature showed that no other cattle had joined the herd for more than 300 years \u2013 yet the creatures are fit and healthy. All harmful recessive genes have been purged from the group through a combination of inbreeding and selection. The Chillingham cattle are an extreme example, but racehorses, too, are bred from a relatively narrow genetic pool. Almost all of the world&apos;s half a million thoroughbreds are descendants from just 28 healthy, fit and fast ancestors born in the 18th and 19th centuries. And up to 95% can be traced to just one stallion \u2013 the Darley Arabian, born in 1700. Centuries of selection for good hearts, healthy respiratory systems and muscle strength has created a genetic pool that is shallow, but not unhealthily so. Harrison&apos;s studies have shown that more inbred horses tend to have the speed and strength that makes them good sprinters. However, high levels of inbreeding in thoroughbreds doesn&apos;t suit all race types. Outbred &quot;mongrels&quot; tend to be more robust and better at withstanding the tough training regimes needed for longer courses. It was partly on the advice of Harrison that Brown bought Darysina and mated her with Frankel. &quot;From within a roughly appropriate economic group, we gave Philip a list of stallions that we thought would suit Darysina,&quot; says Harrison. &quot;Frankel actually came out top because he most suited the profile required for the inbreeding level of Darysina and which might most likely enhance &apos;genetic fixation&apos; within the correct stamina zone and reduce mongrelism.&quot;     Australian Olympic gold medallist and his mare Panamera in a HIDEZ compression suit ahead of London's Olympic Games 2012. Photograph: Aude Reubrecht Tinney Eventi/Rex Features    Decisions about breeding matter because racing is big business. It&apos;s the second most popular spectator sport with more than six million racegoers each year. According to the British Horse Industry Confederation, it employs about 90,000 people directly and indirectly and generates \u00a33.7bn a year for the economy. Perhaps surprisingly, some horses that never win a race can produce exceptional offspring \u2013 if they are bred with the right stock. One of Harrison&apos;s greatest successes is Sacred Choice, bred by Ken Williams&apos;s Tarcoola Stud in Victoria, Australia, which had nine wins from 37 starts including the Group One Doncaster Handicap at Randwick in Sydney and the Group One Myer Classic at Flemington in Melbourne \u2013 two of Australia&apos;s big one-mile races. Yet on paper its mother, Sacred Habit, wasn&apos;t up to much. &quot;Sacred Habit was sold because it was a rusty animal,&quot; says Harrison. &quot;And yet it bred this multiple group-one winner.&quot; The genetic profile suggested that the mother had potential but was too inbred. On Harrison&apos;s advice, she was bred with a stallion called Choisir to produce an offspring with the right balance of strength and stamina and increased mongrelism. The outbreeding did the trick and Sacred Choice became one of the great Australian milers of recent times. When talking to enthusiastic equine geneticists such a Harrison, it&apos;s easy to forget that theirs is a brand new branch of the horseracing industry. The horse genome&apos;s 32 pairs of chromosomes, written in 2.7\u200a\u2009billion base pairs of DNA, were sequenced and published only in 2009 and discoveries are being made all the time about genetic links to performance. One of the leading lights in equine genetics, Dr Emmeline Hill at University College Dublin, was involved in unravelling the genome. In 2010 she discovered that a single gene was crucial in determining the most favourable racing distance for a horse. It was a remarkable discovery because single gene disorders or physiological traits are unusual. While the ability to roll your tongue is caused by a single gene, as is a widow&apos;s peak, the stickiness of your ear wax, and having a big toe that&apos;s shorter than your second toe, more complex characteristics such as intelligence, prowess at sport, musical ability or ability to hurdle are the result of complex interactions between dozens of genes. Yet despite initial scepticism, repeated studies published in scientific journals have supported Hill&apos;s findings. Today her spin-out company, Dublin-based Equinome, offers three tests to owners and trainers, including one based on the single &quot;speed&quot; gene. Hill&apos;s big discovery was that variations in the thoroughbred horse mysostatin gene (MSTN), which encodes for a protein that regulates muscle development and muscle fibre type, determines the type of race that would most suit an animal and whether or not it will be an early developer. DNA is written in four chemical &quot;letters&quot;: A, C, T and G. A crucial point of the speed gene contains either the DNA letter C or the letter T. Every horse has two copies of the MSTN gene \u2013 one inherited from the mother, the other from the father \u2013 so there are three possible genetic combinations: C/C, C/T or T/T. Hill showed that the C/C gene variant leads to greater muscle development when horses first go into training. Creatures with this version were more suited to sprint distances, with 98% having a best race distance of one mile or less. They are the equine equivalent of Usain Bolt and typically have 7% more muscle mass than the other two types at age two. In contrast, animals with the T/T variant produce more of the inhibiting MSTN protein and tend to be leaner and less muscular, making them better suited to longer distance races such as the Derby or Ascot Gold Cup. Those with the C/T version of the gene are the most versatile and are best suited to middle distance races, she showed. &quot;It was the first time that anyone had identified a single gene to an athletic trait in a thoroughbred,&quot; says Donal Ryan, managing director of Equinome. &quot;It&apos;s quite astonishing that a single gene has such significance, but it does.&quot; The company offers a broader &quot;elite performance&quot; test that looks at clusters of genetic markers, including those involved in the regulation of glucose and the respiratory system, while another single gene test gives an indicator of height. The company says this is accurate to within one inch 70% of the time.

Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    Like its British competitor Thoroughbred Genetics, Equinome faced scepticism in the industry from owners and trainers who favoured conventional approaches to breeding. So Hill looked at the price paid for 200 yearlings and compared it to their performance. She found that buyers were paying too much for poor quality horses and that Equinome&apos;s single gene and multi-gene tests were better at predicting success. &quot;Looking back too far in the pedigree becomes of limited value,&quot; says Ryan. &quot;But what the direct parents did is of most importance. However, what an individual will inherit can still be a genetic lottery and so you try to load the dice by having more information about the parents&apos; DNA.&quot; Despite the enthusiasm of equine geneticists, genetically perfect animals can still run like donkeys. Training, nutrition, the jockey and the track conditions can be more important on race day; geneticists estimate that DNA probably accounts for 30-35% of a horse&apos;s performance. So to help load the dice a little more, trainers are turning to people such as Dr Thilo Pfau, a computer scientist and expert in horse gait and lameness at the Royal Veterinary College. A former expert in speech recognition, Pfau makes an unlikely horse boffin. But his skills of identifying patterns have proved useful in spotting the causes of lameness. Racehorses put extraordinary pressures on their legs and muscles. When galloping, each limb has to support the equivalent of two and half times the animal&apos;s body weight. In a 500kg animal, that&apos;s 1.25 tonnes with every stride. With those demands, and with rigorous training regimes, lameness is an industry-wide problem and one that is notoriously tricky to treat. A trainer or vet will watch a trotting horse to try to find the cause of lameness. That may sound straightforward, but it&apos;s not. &quot;The human eye is pretty bad at seeing these mild asymmetries we are looking for,&quot; says Pfau. High-speed cameras may help to identify the problems but they are expensive and you need a lot to monitor a horse in different situations. Pfau&apos;s solution was to take motion sensors used in Hollywood animated movies to mimic human behaviour and attach them to the head, pelvis and hips of horses. The matchbox-sized sensors fed data wirelessly to a computer that analysed the gait. The software didn&apos;t just identify the cause of lameness; it also revealed if it was getting better with treatment. That can be a real problem in veterinary medicine. Horses don&apos;t experience the placebo effect. But vets do. Studies have shown that vets are likely to see an improvement in an animal after treatment even if the behaviour and symptom are the same. Sensors and software don&apos;t suffer from the same bias.     Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has created a set of bespoke titanium horseshoes for a Melbourne race horse using 3D printing. Photograph: CSIRO    The next phase of Pfau&apos;s work is to detect problems before they become serious. Working with the Singapore Turf Club, his team is starting a project to put sensors on 200 racehorses over 18 months. &quot;We want to spot things going wrong early on,&quot; he says. &quot;We can build up a database and we know that a lot will develop injuries over time. If a horse does, we can go back and see what was happening and if there are any early signs.&quot; The sensors are also being used to train jockeys. The biggest single improvement in racing occurred not with the advent of modern medicine, or nutrition, or transport or improved quality of courses, but when jockeys started to stand up. Until the start of the 20th century, British jockeys sat upright on their steeds. But in America, jockeys were experimenting. They discovered that if they put in a bit more effort themselves, and stood in their stirrups, bending forward and moving with the horse, they went faster. In the last decade of the 19th century, the speed of horses shot up by 5-7%. By 1910, British jockeys were doing the same. To investigate why this &quot;crouch&quot; had such a huge effect, Pfau put his sensors on jockeys&apos; belts and on the front of saddles. In a 2009 paper in Science he showed that a horse&apos;s back went up and down around six inches with each stride \u2013 and around four inches at the fore and aft. Crouching jockeys lifted up and down around 2.3 inches. That lift made a huge difference. A jockey makes up around 13% of the total load a horse must carry, so by absorbing some of the movement of the horse by standing in the stirrups, jockeys save the horse work. Pfau is now working with the British Racing School in Newmarket to attach sensors on trainee and experienced jockeys to contrast their riding styles. &quot;The feedback from the sensors should lead to programmes that tell jockeys what they are doing wrong. It&apos;s halfway through a two-year project.&quot; Back in the sunshine of Watership Down, where rabbits loiter in the paddocks, Brown is contented with the progress of his thoroughbred&apos;s pregnancy. Horse owners are philosophical creatures and most are used to losing. They recognise that failure is more common than victory. The stud&apos;s general manager, Simon Marsh, a smartly spoken horse guru who has worked for the Lloyd Webber family since 1992, retains a healthy scepticism about genetics and technology when it comes to breeding. &quot;The complete imponderable here is that you are dealing with livehreestock \u2013 with living, breathing animals,&quot; he says, as he drives Brown away from his inspection of Darysina in a 4x4. &quot;You can predict, if you are on the front row of the grid in a Formula One race that you are probably going to win the grand prix. But if you have the greatest stallion in the world and the best mare in the world, there&apos;s no reason why their progeny won&apos;t be beaten by something that cost just 10% of the price.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/23/world-cup-corruption-allegations-fifa-ghana", "sentences": ["He agreed to co-operate with the authorities and implicated his fellow Singaporean Dan Tan, alleged to be at the heart of the fixing and gambling ring that placed bets on illicit Chinese markets.", "Earlier this week, two businessmen from Singapore and a former footballer, Michael Boeteng, were found guilty of attempting to rig football matches in the UK following an earlier investigation by the Telegraph."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-23T00:50:46Z", "title": "Match-fixing claims involving Ghana cast shadow over World Cup", "tags": ["World Cup", "Sport", "World Cup 2014", "Football", "Ghana", "Africa", "World news", "Ghana", "World Cup 2014 Group G", "Fifa", "Daily Telegraph"], "article": "Fresh match-fixing claims are set to cast a shadow over the World Cup in the wake of allegations that officials connected to the Ghanaian FA were prepared to rig international friendly matches. As part of a joint investigation with Channel 4&apos;s Dispatches, the Daily Telegraph filmed a registered Fifa agent, Christopher Forsythe and Obed Nketiah, who sits on the management committee of the Ghana under-20 team, allegedly promising they would be able to arrange a deal to rig international friendlies. The pair allegedly claimed they would be able to &quot;grease the palms&quot; of Ghana officials to ensure the deal was signed and would include a clause allowing them to select the officials for the friendlies, who would then be able to influence the scoreline. The Ghanaian FA immediately issued a statement which said the two men had been reported to the police &quot;for misrepresenting the GFA with an attempt to defraud&quot;. It confirmed that Forsythe and Nketiah had approached its president, Kwesi Nyantakyi, with a proposal to buy the rights to friendlies for the Black Stars. It claimed that they then turned up without appointment at the Ghanaian pre-World Cup training camp in Miami to discuss their offer, which was submitted to the GFA&apos;s legal committee. &quot;We wish to state that the GFA did not sign the contract as we waited for the response from the legal committee and that the two gentlemen did not make such corrupt offers to the GFA or its officials.&quot;. However, the Telegraph alleged that Nyantakyi had agreed, on a &quot;trial basis&quot;, to a contract that stated the investment company would pay $170,000 (\u00a3100,000) for each match and gave them the right to appoint match officials. Forsythe and Nketiah denied any involvement in a plot to fix matches. Nketiah said: &quot;These are false allegations and I will never in my life do such a thing.&quot; Forsythe said: &quot;To be frank everything I told [the Telegraph] about the match-fixing was a figment of my own imagination because I am so naive that I don&apos;t even know how matches are done. They were promises just to be able to get something off you.&quot; Nyantakyi said he had not read the contract and he did not know about the deal to fix games. He said the proposed match would have been handled by a licensed Fifa match agent and he was unaware that Forsythe had demanded \u00a330,000 for the GFA, the Telegraph reported. Ghana drew 2-2 with Germany on Saturday but will face inevitable questions over the new claims, which are the latest in a long line of allegations that suggest football has an endemic problem with match-fixing. There is no suggestion that any of the World Cup games or players are involved in any match-fixing. On the eve of the World Cup, evidence resurfaced that the South African Football Association had been targeted in 2010 by match-fixers who claimed to be an agency organising friendly matches. A leaked Fifa investigative report showed that &quot;five matches and possibly more&quot; had been fixed in the runup to the 2010 World Cup. At least 15 friendly matches involving teams across the world were targeted, according to the New York Times. A convicted match-fixer, Wilson Raj Perumal, had earlier lifted the lid on a world that relies on influencing match officials and players to manipulate the estimated $200bn-plus illegal betting markets in Asia and the far east. He admitted to being part of a syndicate that fixed a string of international friendlies, sometimes even arranging for &quot;bogus&quot; teams to take part, by bribing corrupt officials and compromised players. He also recently claimed in a new book that his activities had helped Honduras and Nigeria qualify for the 2010 World Cup. He said that the Honduras FA was unaware of his influence. The Nigerian FA denied his claims. Perumal was arrested in Helsinki in 2011 and sentenced to two years in prison. He agreed to co-operate with the authorities and implicated his fellow Singaporean Dan Tan, alleged to be at the heart of the fixing and gambling ring that placed bets on illicit Chinese markets. Last year Europol alleged that more than 380 professional matches in Europe and more than 300 matches played in Africa, Asia and central and South America were under suspicion as the scale of the activities of match fixing gangs from eastern Europe and Asia became clear. Earlier this week, two businessmen from Singapore and a former footballer, Michael Boeteng, were found guilty of attempting to rig football matches in the UK following an earlier investigation by the Telegraph. Chann Sankaran and Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan, sentenced to five years each, claimed to have links to Perumal. Boeteng was sentenced to 18 months. Fifa&apos;s head of security, Ralph Mutschke, has said that the final round of World Cup matches will be closely monitored because they were more susceptible to match fixing. Increased concern over manipulation had caused Fifa to monitor friendly warm up matches across the world ahead of the 2014 tournament. &quot;We know that before the World Cup in South Africa matches were manipulated. Between May 15 and June 11 we monitored 98 friendly matches and for any repercussions and there were no surprises on the betting market,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/nation-states-too-small-for-global-problems", "sentences": ["Fraud in London may begin in Singapore, and involve counterparties in Zurich."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-23T06:00:17Z", "title": "Nation states are too small to fix global problems | Chris Huhne", "tags": ["European Union", "European commission", "Europe", "World news", "UK news", "Environment", "Pollution", "Climate change", "Jean-Claude Juncker", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business"], "article": "Jean-Claude Juncker may not be the right answer, but his candidacy for the presidency of the European commission is at least a response to the right question. The process by which he rose to lead the European People&apos;s party list \u2013 which then emerged as the largest group in the European parliament \u2013 was an attempt to engage voters in the European decisions taken in their name. As such, it confronted the central political issue of our times. We live in a world of increasingly global problems, ineffective national solutions, and consequent disillusion with democratic politics. These tensions will ultimately prove as great a threat to our democracy and our values as the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century. Who cares about pretentious, powerless politicians? Powerlessness is stealthy, insidious and corrosive to our belief that politics matters. At least Europe has attempted to respond by electing its\u00a0supranational legislators. It is, though, a work in progress. Europe is full of talk of the &quot;democratic deficit&quot;, even though EU institutions are the only transnational bodies with any elected component. Nor are the voters impressed. Even in Europe, there is scant understanding of the new transnational realities. The European parliament elections showed a yearning for simple, nationalist solutions. Nigel Farage, Geert Wilders and Marine Le Pen are tribunes of nostalgia for national certainties. Yet scarcely any problem that people care about passionately is any longer susceptible to a purely national solution, even by a\u00a0country as big, powerful and besotted with the perfume of sovereignty as the US. Yesterday&apos;s American hubris is today&apos;s Iraqi disaster. Conflict resolution? Most recent conflicts have begun within societies, not between them. Last week&apos;s UN report noted that there are now 51 million refugees and internally displaced people across the world, half of them children. This was the highest level since the second world war, and mainly due to internal conflict in Syria, South Sudan and the Central African Republic. Yet the UN is no nearer to developing a legitimate template that can impose order in the increasingly common phenomenon of the failed state. Afghanistan, Yemen and Sudan have all been horrible warnings of what can follow from internal collapse, all with consequences far beyond their own frontiers. Ominously, Pakistan is on many experts&apos; danger list, and it is a nuclear weapons state. Even an issue like wealth and income inequality, once the meat and drink of class-based national politics in the old democracies, is not immune. Inequality is likely to grow, as Thomas Piketty has argued. National solutions will not\u00a0work. High tax rates in one country are\u00a0liable to be undercut by competitor countries, sometimes gleefully and deliberately, as in the case of George Osborne&apos;s explicit decision to cut corporation tax rates. The only solution is international agreement on tax avoidance, evasion and minimum tax\u00a0rates. Goodbye nation state. Take the prosperity brought by large-scale mass production. The US is so rich in part because of its huge domestic market. If we want our European companies to produce at scale, they have to be able to make the same product for the whole European market. For such a single market to work, every national market has to have similar consumer safety, health and environmental standards. That means at least Europe-wide \u2013 and maybe soon transatlantic \u2013 rule-setting. Goodbye nation state. Then there is clean water and unpolluted air. Climate change alone makes the case for international action: without it, we are heading inexorably for such extreme weather events that our prosperity will be cataclysmically undermined. Ask the insurers: one group of private companies only too aware of the rising costs and damage of climate change. Take even an area traditionally central to the nation state, such as crime. The European arrest warrant and speedy extradition are responses to the easyJet age. Cybercrime disrespects frontiers as readily as air or sea pollution. Fraud in London may begin in Singapore, and involve counterparties in Zurich. Policing is international, or it is flat-footed. If we cannot grasp these global issues \u2013 fundamental to our future prosperity and to our belief in the efficacy of the public realm \u2013 the disillusion with national politics will fester. When problems are global, solutions must match. Power is increasingly going to be wielded supranationally. That, in turn, brings the challenge of how to make politics work across language and cultural barriers. This is not a counsel of despair. We\u00a0have solved global problems such as the hole in the ozone layer. There are also examples of successful, multilingual democracies that provide a model for the public accountability of international power: India, Switzerland and Canada. (I could add Belgium and Luxembourg, but that is more contentious.) Language barriers may even melt as voice-recognition technology gives everyone a hand-held interpreter. But we need a public debate about where the real problems in our democracy lie, rather than hankering for some mystic past in which powerful nations resolved simple problems with the smack of firm government. David Cameron needs to spell out some home truths to his own party, and start to provide some answers himself. The greatest democratic problem today is the weakening power of the nation state faced by threats stretching beyond its borders. The nation&apos;s weakness is fatally wounding the prestige of its political elites.

According to the North Korea Economy Watch blog, ahead of the trade fair, North Korean state media reported that foreign economists are anticipating further growth of the country&apos;s economy. It also said the increasing interest in the trade fair reflects the increasing quality of new products being made in North Korea. In an interview, a representative for the Korean International Exhibition Corporation was quoted as saying: \u201cEven amidst economic sanctions imposed by America and its followers, our nation\u2019s economic construction is moving forward with speed.\u201d     The European Business Association in DPRK says it aims to \"develop business and trade relations between Europe and North Korea\".

The company usually has a stand at the event, and in the past has used the trade fair to launch new models of tablet computer. The devices are made by Chinese vendors, labeled with the KCC logo and have typically run Google\u2019s Android operating system with customisation and software from KCC. This time, tablets were also on show.

The survey, by the Organisation for Economic Development and Cooperation (OECD), revealed that teachers in England were younger and less experienced than their peers in most other countries \u2013 and were more likely to be pitched into more difficult teaching conditions at the start of their careers. Yet despite the long working hours and feeling unappreciated, a large majority say they like their profession and the schools they work in, with younger teachers most likely to be the happiest in their job. The survey of teachers working in 34 countries reported that full-time teachers in English secondary schools worked 48 hours a week, with one in 10 reporting working weeks of 65 hours or more. But the survey found that teachers spent about 20 hours a week in the classroom, with the remainder of their time spent on administration, lesson preparation and marking work. The OECD figures showed that teachers in England spent more time on those tasks than their colleagues in countries with high-performing education systems, despite schools in England employing a larger proportion of teaching assistants and support staff. Even in the classroom, nearly 20% of teachers&apos; time is taken up with keeping order and further administration; just 16 hours of a 48-hour average full-time working week is spent on teaching and learning with pupils. Chris Husbands, director of the University of London&apos;s Institute of Education, said: &quot;This may be a result of the high levels of autonomy enjoyed by English schools which mean each school takes on more of the necessary administration and bureaucracy themselves.&quot; Among the leading European countries, teachers in Finland spent slightly longer in the classroom at 21 hours a week but worked just 32 hours each week overall. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said: &quot;In England, teachers&apos; working lives are dominated by bureaucracy and form-filling, and school leaders are not empowered to do what they know is best for their pupils.&quot; About 80% of teachers in English schools are under the age of 50, while 20% are under the age of 30. The average secondary school teacher in England is also less experienced than their peers overseas, with 12 years at the chalkface compared with 16 years in the 33 remaining countries. Dylan Wiliam, professor of educational assessment at the University of London, said it was surprising that only Singapore had teachers with less teaching experience than England, and that England sent its younger teachers to work in more challenging schools. &quot;In other countries the trend is for more challenging schools \u2013 that is those with more poor students, more students with English as an additional language, more students with special needs \u2013 to have more experienced teachers,&quot; Wiliam said. Nearly half of the headteachers surveyed by the OECD said they struggled to recruit experienced and qualified staff in many areas, such as special needs. The survey also supported complaints by teachers about the level of appraisal they face from schools and Ofsted inspectors, with only 11% saying they had never received a formal appraisal, lower than any country other than South Korea. Yet the widespread use of appraisal appears to go to waste in many cases. &quot;Unlike most other countries with comprehensive appraisal systems, fewer than half of teachers in England report that feedback from appraisal has any impact on their teaching,&quot; William noted. While only around one in three teachers said they felt the value of teaching was appreciated by society, that figure was well above many other countries, such as France, Sweden and Spain, where fewer than 10% felt that it was valued. More than four out of five teachers in England said they were satisfied with their job, while only 8% said they regretted becoming a teacher. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: &quot;It is clear from the survey that although teachers love their profession, workload is unmanageable, accountability systems add unnecessary pressure and they are underpaid for the work they do. &quot;This is an issue that concerns everyone. Our children deserve enthusiastic, energetic teachers, not overworked and stressed ones.&quot; The OECD used a sample of 154 schools and nearly 2,500 secondary teachers from both state and independent schools in England, making it the most extensive survey of its type, according to Husbands."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/jun/25/busy-teachers-england-miss-out-professional-development", "sentences": ["In Singapore, for example, after a number of years you can move up to the next level and specialise, but this is measured by management responsibility.&quot; Work schedule is the main barrier to teachers in England taking part in professional development \u2013 60.4% of lower secondary teachers agree or strongly agree that work is the prime obstacle."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-25T12:08:00Z", "title": "Busy teachers in England missing out on professional development", "tags": ["Professional development", "Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching", "Schools", "Teacher training", "Teachers' workload"], "article": "Teachers in England spend half as many days on professional development as their colleagues abroad, according to research by the OECD. The Teaching and Learning International Survey (Talis) \u2013 which collects information on school learning environments in more than 30 countries, focusing on those teaching 11-16 year-olds \u2013 found that England&apos;s teachers are also less likely to engage with in-depth professional development activities such as research or studying for a qualification. Three quarters of teachers in England took training courses or workshops during the past 12 months \u2013 higher than the average across all the Talis countries, which stands at 71%. But only one in 10 English teachers studied for a formal qualification, and teachers in England were also more likely to miss conferences or seminars because of work schedules. Overall, the number of days spent on professional development per teacher was only half the average across Talis countries. David Weston, chief executive of the Teacher Development Trust, said: &quot;In England, we don&apos;t have a system of formal qualifications that you can go through to advance your career \u2013 there are no longer identifiable next steps once you&apos;re qualified unless you want to move into management. In Singapore, for example, after a number of years you can move up to the next level and specialise, but this is measured by management responsibility.&quot; Work schedule is the main barrier to teachers in England taking part in professional development \u2013 60.4% of lower secondary teachers agree or strongly agree that work is the prime obstacle. This is the same situation in other advanced education systems, such as Japan and Finland; in Japan this figure increases to 86.4% whereas in Finland only 51.9% of teachers say the same. Most English teachers have high levels of access to professional development, according to the report, which found that teachers are rarely expected to pay for training. Formal inductions \u2013 where teachers are introduced to a new school \u2013 and mentoring programmes are almost universal. Nearly all teachers in England also have formal appraisals, the research suggests. But it warns that only one third of people say they this feedback improves their motivation, public recognition, job satisfaction or responsibilities. &quot;Making appraisal and feedback meaningful is especially important for teachers&apos; feelings of self-efficacy and job satisfaction in England,&quot; the report reads. &quot;Those teachers who believe that appraisal and feedback influence their teaching also report higher job satisfaction, whereas those who feel that it is only an administrative exercise report lower self-efficacy.&quot; More than half (51%) of lower secondary teachers in England agree or strongly agree that teacher appraisals and feedback are largely done to fill administrative requirements. Commenting on the results, Weston said: &quot;Many schools feel under pressure to make performance management systems improve the appearance of the school for accountability purposes rather than making it about growing the teachers and helping the children succeed. &quot;In some schools there&apos;s an element of ticking boxes and jumping through hoops to satisfy Ofsted rather than helping children in the classroom or helping teachers develop as professionals and this can have an affect on how they view appraisals.&quot; Collaborative working among teachers was related to higher levels of job satisfaction across the Talis countries; teachers who participate in collaborative professional development five times a year or more report significantly enhanced levels of job satisfaction in two-thirds of the countries. Only 19.5% of English teachers said that observing other schools was part of their professional development, however, and this was 0.5% above the average for responses from other countries.

Jeb Hensarling, the chairman of the House financial services committee, is leading a conservative charge against the Export-Import Bank, which will stop functioning as an export credit lending agency unless its charter is renewed before the end of September. The debate over the future of the Ex-Im Bank, as it is known, has become significant ideological battle, pitting pro-business Republicans, who believe the bank levels the international playing field, and a more conservative faction that was recently emboldened by the defeat of majority leader Eric Cantor at the hands of a Tea Party primary challenger. Cantor\u2019s soon-to-be successor as majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, has said he is prepared to see the bank\u2019s charter expire, while John Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, indicated he will take a lead from Hensarling. Hensarling, the Texan chairman of the committee, is one of the most vocal critics of the Ex-Im Bank, which he argues is mismanaged and provides effective subsidies to foreign companies that undercut US business. Hensarling and other critics call the Ex-Im bank a form of &quot;corporate welfare&quot;, pointing out the support it provides benefits Wall Street, as well as giant corporations like Boeing and Caterpillar, that do not need the help. \u201cEven Boeing \u2013 the bank\u2019s biggest beneficiary \u2013 has admitted it doesn\u2019t really need Ex-Im and could \u2018arrange alternative financing\u2019 without it,\u201d Hensarling said at the hearing. \u201cPerhaps what is most disturbing about the Ex-Im Bank is its ideological and crony-based lending practices,\u201d he added. \u201cIt has a \u2018green\u2019 energy quota. It permits no assistance for coal projects. It has a mandate to specifically support exports going to sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d     House financial services committee chairman, representative Jeb Hensarling, said it was particularly 'disturbing' that the bank has a 'green' energy quota. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    The Ex-Im Bank is an export credit agency that lubricates the US export market with capital and loan guarantees, as well as credit insurance. Its financing assistance goes to both US exporters who struggle to get help from private banks and foreign companies requiring an incentive to buy American goods and services. Supporters, including Democrats and the White House, point out there are 59 other equivalent credit agencies that support exports from other major economies around the world, including in Europe and China, and argue that allowing the Ex-Im Bank to expire amounts to \u201cunilateral disarmament\u201d in the economic contest in foreign markets. They also argue that vast bulk of the bank&apos;s transactions benefit small and medium-sized businesses, supporting 1.2 million jobs in the US over the last five years, and is self-sustaining, returning $1bn to the Treasury in the last year. Critics respond that the bank&apos;s accounting techniques are misleading and the benefits to the US economy overstated. When the Ex-Im Bank charter was last re-authorised in 2012, Congress insisted on reforms that, critics argue, were not fully implemented. Hensarling gave no firm indication about whether he would seek to block the bank&apos;s reauthorisation at all costs, although he hinted he may countenance a reformed credit agency.  \u201cI will admit that Republicans may disagree on whether Ex-Im should be reformed or allowed to expire, and I certainly hope this hearing will help illuminate that decision,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are united in believing we cannot reauthorize the status quo.\u201d     Boeing receives support from the Ex-Im Bank. Photograph: Paul J Richards/AFP/Getty Images    Any new reforms are likely to include changes to refocus the bank on smaller businesses and changes to reduce the potential risk on the US taxpayer. Democrats in the House on Tuesday introduced a bill that would extend the bank\u2019s charter for seven years. If, as expected, there are obstacles in the Republican-dominated House, a separate bill to extend the authorisation of the bank could also emerge from the Senate. Maxine Waters, from California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, hit back hard at Hensarling during the hearing, listing the companies in his district she said benefited from Ex-Im Bank financing. \u201cLet\u2019s be serious, this hearing is not going to be a forthright discussion of the merits of the bank, Mr Chairman,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know your position on the bank.\u201d  She added: \u201cWe know you\u2019ve made ending the nank your top priority, regardless if it\u2019s at the expense of thousands of American companies trying to compete against businesses in China, Russia, Korea and countries across Europe \u2013 all of which have their own version of the Ex-Im Bank.\u201d Democrats like Waters are being joined by some Republicans on the committee who believe that, while requiring some reform may be necessary, it would be imprudent to extinguish a lifeline provided to US business. Republican John Campbell, of California, is working on a bill to reform the bank while also renewing its charter. However staunchly conservative groups like the Heritage Foundation and Club for Growth are fundamentally opposed to any interference in the exports, which they argue distorting effects. They would like to see the bank shut down, but they are facing a tough retaliation from the Chamber of Commerce and other pro-business groups, who believe the Ex-Im Bank charter, which has been renewed by bipartisan congressional support repeatedly since it was founded in 1934, cannot be allowed to lapse.     When a witness testifying noted that the oil and gas industry receives government subsidies, Texas representative and committee chair said 'I've got limited time.' Photograph: Sarah Lee    At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Hensarling invited witnesses from the US airline industry, who said they were disadvantaged by the Ex-Im Bank providing financial assistance to rival, often state-owned airlines in overseas. Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta Arlines, pointed out that state-run airlines owned by rich foreign governments, such as Singapore and Abu Dhabi, were effectively \u201csubsidised\u201d by the US taxpayers&apos; financing of Boeing exports. \u201cOur Treasury finances their airplanes well below market rates,\u201d he said, although he said he was inclined to reform rather than close the bank. There was a revealing exchange between Hensarling and another witness, Steven Wilburn, the CEO of FirmGreen Inc, a small, California-based green energy company that has benefited from the bank\u2019s financing and was the only pro-bank independent witness invited to give testimony by the committee. After the financial crisis in 2008, Wilburn said his private bank divested from his company, but he was able to begin a biogas project in Brazil with assistance from the Ex-Im Bank.  \u201cI have no doubt Ex-Im helps your business,\u201d Hensarling said. \u201cBut do you acknowledge it can hurt other businesses?\u201d The committee chairman argued that it was wrong for Wilburn&apos;s company to receive &quot;any government subsidy\u201d for business conducted abroad while millions of companies serving an American domestic market, he said, had not equivalent federal help. \u201cHow is that fair?\u201d Hernsarling asked  \u201cSir, I\u2019d love to compete on a fairer basis in America with my green technology,\u201d Wilburn replied. \u201cI can\u2019t sell my technology here because the barriers to entry to the market \u2013 the oil and gas industry is subsidised by 15% oil and gas depletion allowance.\u201d Hensarling, whose Texan district relies heavily on the oil and gas industry, which receives tax breaks and other incentives from the US government, cut the off businessman mid-sentence. \u201cI\u2019ve got limited time,\u201d he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/jun/26/student-unrealistic-job-expectations", "sentences": ["Bernard-Jones spent the second year of his degree at the University of Berkeley and the National University of Singapore, where he curated an exhibition for the university museum."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-26T08:46:13Z", "title": "Students expect better jobs than they'll get, survey shows", "tags": ["Students", "Higher education", "Education", "Employability", "Careers", "Graduate careers", "Work & careers", "Guardian Careers", "Job hunting"], "article": "Students have an unrealistic expectation of their job prospects on graduating, a survey has found. The Student Employability Index, which questioned 4,000 students at 20 universities, finds amost three-quarters (79%) expect to be in a graduate-level job within six months. But government figures show that only only around half (53%) of those who graduated within the past five years are in such jobs. Men are even more confident than women: 83% of men and 77% of women expect to be in graduate-level employment within six months. Students&apos; salary expectations are more realistic, however, with most expecting to be earning between \u00a315,000 and \u00a324,999 within six months, in line with real graduate earnings. Aaron Porter, director of external affairs at the National Centre for Universities and Business (NCUB) and author of the report, says the findings are surprising: &quot;You can hardly fail to pick up a newspaper over the last five years and read how competitive it is to get a job, yet the overwhelming majority of students retain an optimistic view of how quickly they&apos;ll reach graduate-level employment.&quot; Choosing a course The survey also finds that students&apos; choice of university is influenced by future employment prospects. While the quality of their preferred course is the most important factor in choosing an institution, 62% say they were influenced by job prospects after graduation. More than a third (36%) say that earning potential was an important consideration \u2013 though more so for men (42%) than women (32%). Students are acutely aware of the importance of work experience and internships in helping them gain a job: 93% describe gaining an internship or work experience as either &quot;essential&quot; or &quot;somewhat important&quot; in helping them secure a job in their preferred sector. Julian White, assistant head of the careers and employability service at Manchester Metropolitan University, says he has seen an increase in student awareness of employability at open days: &quot;We&apos;ve seen a lot more people asking, &apos;Will I get a placement with this course, and is the local economy the kind of place where I&apos;ll find a part-time job?&apos; They&apos;ve started to understand that success beyond university isn&apos;t just about grades, it&apos;s also about having a set of job-related skills, and the best way of demonstrating that is through work experience.&quot; Tough job market Emeric Bernard-Jones, 20, a new graduate in politics from Queen Mary University of London, has been finding out just how tough the graduate job market is. He would like a career in parliament or in the civil service, and has applied for dozens of jobs \u2013 many of them requiring A-levels but not a degree \u2013 without being called for a single interview. Of his friends, only one person so far has had an interview. Bernard-Jones spent the second year of his degree at the University of Berkeley and the National University of Singapore, where he curated an exhibition for the university museum. &quot;I thought this would be a good experience, but apparently not,&quot; he says. &quot;I&apos;m applying for internships that pay \u00a36 an hour, but I&apos;m not getting anywhere with them. I earned more working at McDonald&apos;s.&quot; He can&apos;t afford to take unpaid work, and thinks this may put him at a disadvantage: &quot;It doesn&apos;t seem to be that the people who get the best grades actually get the jobs, it&apos;s the people who can afford to stay here [in London] and wait it out.&quot; James Pascoe, a second-year history student at York University who wants a career in law or journalism, recognises that the graduate job market is intensely competitive, but is still optimistic: &quot;It&apos;s a tough time for undergrads, but I think that the industries I want to go into are meritocratic. As long as you&apos;re good enough, I think your luck will even out in the end.&quot; He believes that his experience on the student newspaper will stand him in good stead: &quot;I will keep looking for introductions and small unpaid work experience stints to keep the CV ticking over \u2013 I think that&apos;s important to show employers that you really care about what you want to do.&quot; The survey suggests there is a mismatch, Porter argues, between what universities are offering and what students expect: &quot;University is about more than just getting a job. It&apos;s about personal development, new networks and exploring a discipline.  &quot;But students are saying that employment outcomes are the most important thing, and they&apos;re not always getting the chance to achieve success. I think the report asks questions of universities that collectively and individually they&apos;ll need to answer.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/jun/26/green-executive-compensation-intel-alcoa-pay", "sentences": ["These ranged from planting a vegetable garden at a children\u2019s home in Singapore, where Intel employs 400 people, to making a water purification system for a village in India that is home to 4,300 Intel employees.", "Intel employees planting a vegetable garden in a children's home in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-26T15:43:41Z", "title": "Putting your money where your mouth is: companies link green goals to pay", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Ethical business", "Corporate social responsibility", "Environment", "Business", "Intel", "Brand", "Business case", "Leadership"], "article": "In 2008, when Intel launched its sustainability goals for 2012, its leadership team took an unusual step to encourage employees to help: it linked environmental performance to every employee&apos;s compensation, effectively making its sustainability goals everyone&apos;s job.  \u201cEveryone has an interest because everyone cares about their pay,\u201d says Michael Jacobson, director of corporate responsibility. The incentive certainly paid off: by 2012, Intel\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions were down 35% on an absolute basis and 28% on a per chip basis, its energy reductions were up and its operations were growing.  Intel is one of the few companies offering incentives to all of its workers, but a May 2014 report by Ceres, a sustainability advocacy non-profit, found that a growing number of companies are incorporating sustainability performance into executive compensation packages.  According to Ceres&apos; report, 24% of companies now link executive compensation to sustainability performance, up from 15% in 2012. Andrea Moffat, vice president of Ceres&apos; corporate program, says the report shows companies are increasingly tying compensation to goals related to environmental or social regulatory requirements \u2013 such as meeting health and safety targets, air emission reductions or, in the utility sector, producing a certain percentage of renewable energy.  A small number of companies, about 3%, have even gone beyond compliance-based metrics. They&apos;re linking compensation to voluntary sustainability targets such as improved diversity, reduced water risks in their supply chains and lower GHG emissions. \u201cThese companies are communicating to executives and employees that improving performance on the sustainability metrics is directly linked to the financial sustainability of the corporation, both long and short term,\u201d Moffat says.  One company, Alcoa, demonstrates how this linkage can work. In 2013, it tied 20% of its bonus plan to a collection of sustainability targets. It directly linked 5% of its bonuses to CO2 emissions, 5% to safety improvements and 10% to creating a more diverse workforce. The company&apos;s achievement payouts suggest that the incentives worked: Alcoa awarded 2.8% of its bonuses for CO2 reduction, 7.4% for safety improvements and 11.5% for diversity hiring. In other words, when it came to safety and diversity, Alcoa exceeded its goals.  What\u2019s driving the trend? Moffat says the study results are sending an important signal for more companies to tie compensation to sustainability goals. The key, she notes, is a growing realization that, if companies hope to meet their environmental and social responsibility targets, they must incentivize their employees and executives. \u201cWe all react to our pay checks,\u201d she says.   But how do large companies connect sustainability performance to employee pay? One way is making employees compete against each other in the pursuit of specific sustainability goals. For instance, in 2013, Intel ran a competition for sustainability projects. Out of 57 employee teams that entered, 12 received environmental excellence awards \u2013 as well as a pay bonus for every worker on a winning team.   The projects were wide-ranging and had a significant impact. One victor, a team in New Mexico, reconfigured energy flows, which reduced CO2 emissions in a central utilities building by 27,000 tons per year.   Another Intel grant program funded environmental projects headed by nine employee teams. These ranged from planting a vegetable garden at a children\u2019s home in Singapore, where Intel employs 400 people, to making a water purification system for a village in India that is home to 4,300 Intel employees.      Intel employees planting a vegetable garden in a children's home in Singapore. Photograph: Intel    From the outside, sustainability may seem to be a secondary concern for a company like Intel, but Jacobson says that the decision to make sustainability part of an employee&apos;s performance review has spurred improvements in the company&apos;s products. \u201cWhen you look at our servers built in 2007 versus today, you see 1,900% more energy efficiency,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have our employees and these incentives to thank for that.\u201d  Not all Intel employees are enthused about reducing their environmental footprint, but the initiatives send a clear message throughout the company. \u201cThis is a way for leadership to tell its workers that the environment matters to us as a company, this is important,\u201d Jacobsen says. How much impact? Wayne Guay, a professor of accounting at the University of Pennsylvania&apos;s Wharton School of Business, confirms that a growing number of companies have begun incorporating sustainability performance into their executive compensation packages. His research indicates that there is a greater awareness among boards of directors that sustainability is important to a company\u2019s stockholders, customers and employees. And given the effect that sustainability can have on a company\u2019s overall performance, it naturally follows that the board should factor it into executive compensation. \u201cBy putting sustainability into any corporate compensation plan, the board is signalling to employees, management and stakeholders that they are watching this\u2014and that is an important development,\u201d he says.  Guay also sees boards taking their cues from company shareholders through votes on a growing range of corporate responsibility measures. Target\u2019s board of directors, for instance, recently considered a proposal to minimize the environmental impacts of its electronics recycling activities by promoting reuse of working equipment. Although it failed, the proposal managed to garner a significant 30.8% of the vote.  Some environmental initiatives are more successful. At Ameron Corp., for example, shareholders recently passed an environmental safety proposal with 52.7% of the vote, providing the board with a mandate to commission a report on the company\u2019s efforts to reduce environmental and health hazards associated with handling coal combustion waste.  Guay notes, however, that sustainability accounts for only a tiny percentage of compensation analysis \u2013 in most cases, it&apos;s less than 1% of an executive\u2019s overall performance review. He points to Intel\u2019s proxy statement (pdf), which breaks down its annual incentive cash bonus calculation into absolute financial, relative financial and operational components. Within operational components, seven subcomponents exist, including organization health and environment. That\u2019s where sustainability resides, making up only 7 out of 100 points. \u201cSo sustainability performance may make up only 1% of the calculation,\u201d Guay says.  Moving forward, Guay expects to see more companies incorporating sustainability into their computations. He is not sure, however, whether sustainability will ever make the top 10 items a board measures to determine a company&apos;s and executive\u2019s performance. Still, he&apos;s hopeful: \u201cAny improvement in the space likely indicates that the board is measuring and thinking about sustainability.&quot; D G McCullough is an independent writer, editor and owner of Hanging Rock Media in Cary, North Carolina The finance hub is funded by EY.

I plan to take my two-year-old HP Pavilion laptop. Will it survive the humidity? What supporting tech should I use for backups? Also, is Skype the best way to stay in touch with friends and family in the UK? Alan  I don&apos;t expect too many people are planning to spend a year near the equator, but millions of holidaymakers may face the same problems on a smaller scale. But do people worry about taking their laptops and tablets to, say, hot and humid Florida or Hong Kong? I don&apos;t think so. Most of today&apos;s laptops are made in China by Taiwanese contract manufacturers and the same machines are sold in practically every country in the world. They seem to survive all the different climates. The real issue is not so much the country as whether you&apos;re in a developed part of it. The main cities and large towns in peninsular Malaysia do not seem to be any more hazardous than similar cities in Florida or California. You&apos;ll be able to sit in a Malaysian Starbucks (there are 140 of them), or a local equivalent, and use the free power-points and Wi-Fi. If you were going trekking in the jungles of Borneo \u2013 where the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak are situated \u2013 it would be a different story. In this case, I have quite a bit of experience. My wife was born in Malaysia so I have relatives in Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur and Penang, as well as in Singapore. Other large cities include Johor Bahru (almost 2 million people, cheek by jowl with Singapore), Shah Alam and Petaling Jaya. It&apos;s true that Malaysia suffers from tropical rainstorms, particularly from October to December, but most people just stay indoors until they blow over. Laptop hygiene The main threats to laptops are heat, moisture and dirt, including dust, sand and fluff. None of these is specific to Malaysia. You shouldn&apos;t have any problems if you take the same kind of precautions that you would take in the UK. For example, if your laptop is prone to overheating, use it on a riser or cooler so that air can flow all around the case. Always use it on a table or tray rather than carpets or bedding etc that can block air vents and produce fan-clogging fluff. Carry it in a slipcase to protect it from dirt and rain. In theory, moisture could be a problem, due to condensation. Some companies supply environmentally sealed enclosures for PCs used in hazardous climates, but those are not appropriate for laptops. They also apply &quot;conformal coatings&quot; to electronics to protect them from moisture. This is a sophisticated industrial process. You can buy spray cans of stuff online but disassembling your laptop and spraying the motherboard would probably do more harm than good. One extra precaution: don&apos;t munch sandwiches and biscuits over your keyboard. Food scraps may attract small creepy-crawlies, including ants. Your laptop could end up riddled with a different sort of bugs. Storage for backups How much storage will you need? It depends how much data you are going to generate. Over the years, I&apos;ve shifted from small external hard drives to USB thumb drives and most recently to SD cards for backup storage. This is partly because most of my data originates on SD cards in digital cameras and recorders, and my laptop has a built-in card slot. But cheap SD cards now come in large capacities such as 16GB and 32GB, they don&apos;t have any mechanical parts that could fail, and they take up very little space. You can currently buy 32GB SD cards for \u00a311 to \u00a316 or so, and 64GB cards for roughly \u00a315-\u00a330, depending on speed, so that would be an economical way to store 100GB of data. If you need an order of magnitude more space, then buy a 1TB portable hard drive for around \u00a350. With 1TB, you can take a full backup of your laptop&apos;s hard drive in case you need to reinstall everything. The main aim is to have backup copies of irreplaceable data that won&apos;t disappear if your laptop fails or is stolen. If there&apos;s not too much of it, you may be able to back it up online. In this case, Dropbox is probably the best service, but it only provides 2GB free. Alternatives include Microsoft&apos;s OneDrive, which offers 15GB free with each email address, Barracuda&apos;s Copy (also 15GB) and possibly Kim Dotcom&apos;s Mega (50GB). If you use Microsoft Office, then Office 365 offers 1TB of storage per person up to 5TB for only \u00a37.99 per month or \u00a379.99 per year. This is great value even if you don&apos;t actually use Microsoft Office. For comparison, Dropbox provides only 100GB for $9.99 a month \u2013 the same as Microsoft&apos;s US price \u2013 while Copy Pro offers 250GB. (I don&apos;t recommend Google Drive for backups.) If you expect to take a lot of photographs and/or videos, then Yahoo&apos;s Flickr offers 1TB of free space. The problem with online storage is that it can take ages to upload data, and bulk uploads are not always as reliable as they should be. But if you have decent Wi-Fi and you&apos;re just backing up a few documents and photos every day, it provides extra security without too much effort. Keeping in touch Skype is still a good way to keep in touch with close friends and family members, and Skype-to-Skype video seems to work well between the UK and Malaysia, though it&apos;s not always convenient because of the time difference. My own family \u2013 which includes relatives in Ireland and Kuwait as well as Malaysia and Singapore \u2013 mostly uses Facebook. We have a closed group, which means family messages are not shown to other friends. Facebook messaging adds one-to-one communications, almost totally replacing SMS. Facebook also makes it easy to share photos. If we&apos;d been setting something up from scratch then we might have looked for something else, but that&apos;s irrelevant. All of us were already on Facebook when I set up the family group, so I didn&apos;t have to ask anybody to sign up. If I&apos;d tried, say, Google+, I&apos;d have had to persuade at least a dozen people to start using it just to make it viable for the others, and the chances of that happening were zero. Even if that had worked, nobody would have abandoned Facebook because their non-family friends are on it as well. To conclude, whatever you&apos;re using to keep in touch now, you can use from Malaysia or anywhere else. This includes voice calls, which you can make via Skype or using one of the internationally-oriented mobile systems such as WorldSIM. (Dual-sim phones are particularly handy when working abroad.) You&apos;ll probably find that time differences and cost constraints seamlessly shift the balance towards Facebook messaging or WhatsApp or whatever&apos;s handiest for everybody."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/28/intelligent-energy-green-power-fuel-cell", "sentences": ["Other institutional investors include Foreign &amp; Colonial, a former arm of the Russian oil company Yukos, plus the Singapore sovereign wealth fund, GIC, which has committed itself to taking a further \u00a316.6m stake in the clean energy business."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-27T23:23:53Z", "title": "Intelligent Energy fuel cell company plans stock market flotation", "tags": ["Hydrogen power", "UK news", "Energy", "Renewable energy", "Environment", "Business"], "article": "Intelligent Energy, a green power company originally formed by academics from Loughborough University, unveiled plans on Friday to float on the London Stock Exchange, with an expected value of \u00a3600m.

Then, when the solicitor&apos;s training contract he had eagerly pursued evaded his grasp, he established an agency to help those similarly qualified find work. He already has 10,000 aspiring lawyers on his books. In a country where there are as many as 200,000 lawyers \u2013 about one in 300 of \u00a0the population \u2013 there may be a surplus of tens of thousands of highly educated applicants. Burdened with crumpled expectations and large debts, sometimes of more than \u00a350,000, acquired through course fees and living expenses, many find work as paralegals earning less than \u00a320,000 a year with few prospects for promotion. By contrast, solicitors in the City of London may start on \u00a338,000 and within two years can be earning \u00a390,000. Clague studied economics and business at Durham University. He graduated in 2008 then borrowed \u00a325,000 to do law conversion studies \u2013 essential for those whose first degree was not law \u2013 and for the legal practice course (LPC) needed to become a solicitor. But on graduation, two years later, he discovered there were not enough training contracts and that he had failed to secure a job. &quot;I wanted to be a solicitor. If you spend that much you want a return,&quot; he said. &quot;I went to admission days and did tests but never quite got over the line. There&apos;s a huge backlog of well-qualified candidates working as paralegals and still looking to become solicitors.&quot; A year later, he set up a recruitment agency, the Stephen James Partnership, to help qualified lawyers, and was stunned when graduates and law firms came in droves. &quot;We have 10,000 people registered. I met one person who completed their LPC 10 years ago and is still looking for a training contract,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation is even worse for those trying to become barristers. I have spoken to people who have first- and upper-second-class degrees from Oxbridge and can&apos;t get a pupillage. There&apos;s a huge oversupply of law graduates and paralegals, so the firms are able to depress wages unless you get into a specialist area. We see people with \u00a365,000 of debt. It&apos;s a tough place to be for a lot of people.&quot; Are there too many lawyers? Chris Grayling, the justice secretary, thinks so. In October he told the justice select committee there was an oversupply and too many people were being trained. The last Labour justice secretary, Jack Straw, made similar comments in 2010. Certainly, more people are qualifying in the profession while legal aid fees contract, crime falls and competition pressures from deregulation lead to amalgamations. Many more law firms closed last year than opened. The surplus is blamed partly on an excess of university courses \u2013 20,070 students were accepted to read law in 2013, though not all intend to become lawyers \u2013 and partly on legal practice courses and conversion schemes that prepare graduates for life as a solicitor. At the same time, Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes and Swiss bankers bring their disputes to the courtrooms of the Rolls Building in central London in increasing numbers. The government is promoting the UK as a global law centre. Last year more than 75% of litigants in the commercial court came from abroad. Skilled British lawyers are needed to develop what is turning into a massive export earner for the Treasury. There is also a largely unmet domestic need for lawyers to advise clients on housing, debt and benefit claims that are no longer supported by legal aid. Advice on the law is desperately needed, but no longer extensively subsidised or affordable. Guy Beringer, chairman of the Legal Education Foundation and a former partner at City law firm Allen &amp; Overy, believes the number of lawyers in the commercial sector is about to increase. &quot;Most people think there&apos;s a structural change in the legal profession in the sense that demand for lawyers has peaked. I still think it will grow in the commercial [sector]. The recession meant a diminution of trade, but we are about to enter a period of economic growth.&quot; Increased regulation, he said, meant a greater need for in-house lawyers. Beringer added: &quot;So you are left with whether you want to artificially constrain [the intake]. There has been talk of having aptitude tests or filters.&quot; Technology could allow more legal work to be devolved to paralegals, he suggested. &quot;There will have to be low-cost ways of providing services and that&apos;s going to require a different breed of lawyers.&quot; Nigel Savage, who in April retired as president of the University of Law, the largest provider of LPC courses, agreed: &quot;I&apos;ve been doing this for 30 years and there have been periods when there&apos;s been too few and periods of oversupply. What has happened recently is that the market has corrected itself. &quot;Where you have people saying there are too many lawyers, it puts people off doing law. And there&apos;s a danger of it leading to a shortage. Law is very diverse. English law oils the whole of global commerce. It&apos;s a great boom. There have been chambers opening up in Geneva, Hong Kong, Singapore. The commercial market is beginning to do well as the economy picks up.&quot; Some trends are already discernible. As many as 21% of solicitors now work as in-house lawyers and the Ministry of Justice has been recruiting lawyers for its salaried Public Defender Service to avoid using highly paid barristers. Senior judges have also been musing about replacing expensive adversarial courtroom clashes with simpler, judge-led, inquisitorial procedures. Paralegals believe they will soon dominate the legal profession. &quot;It&apos;s the consumer who has been suffering,&quot; said Amanda Hamilton, chief executive of the National Association of Licensed Paralegals. &quot;If consumers are offered a choice, they prefer the \u00a350-an-hour paralegal rather than the \u00a3500-an-hour solicitor. In future there will be fewer top-echelon jobs, an opening up of the legal sector and more emphasis on less costly services.&quot; James O&apos;Connell, head of policy at the Institute of Paralegals, said solicitors had priced themselves out of the market. &quot;In the old days, law was like a priesthood. Nowadays we are in contact with the law all the time: speeding tickets, health and safety, wills etc. &quot;Solicitors&apos; firms are hollowing out. They are getting rid of really expensive solicitors and getting work done by paralegals. That&apos;s why there&apos;s a shortage of training contracts. There are too many unaffordable lawyers and too few affordable ones.&quot; The legal profession in numbers \u2022 A 2008 Eurostat study found the UK had 2.27 lawyers per 1,000 citizens \u2013 well above the European average of 1.81 but below the US, which has 3.82. \u2022 According to the Legal Services Board, there are 166,853 solicitors, barristers, chartered legal executives, licensed conveyancers, trademark agents, patent attorneys, notaries and other lawyers in England and Wales. If the number of judges, court clerks, university law lecturers, non-practising solicitors, paralegals and all the lawyers in Northern Ireland and Scotland are included, the figure would come to well over 200,000 \u2013 about one in 300 of the population. \u2022 In 1980, there were 39,795 practising solicitors in England and Wales. This April, the Solicitors Regulation Authority found there were 129,083. The number of practising barristers has grown from 4,589 to 15,585 in the same period. \u2022 The number of solicitor training contracts has fallen from more than 6,000 in 2008 to 5,302 in 2013. \u2022 Four years ago, the Law Society estimated there were more than 15,500 aspiring lawyers who had completed LPC places but could not find training contracts with firms to complete their professional training. \u2022 The number of barrister pupillages has contracted sharply, from 695 places in 2001 to 429 in 2013."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/29/money-robbery-respect-banks-financial-crime", "sentences": ["I was recently a participant in a panel in Mexico City that included Nick Leeson, the Singapore-based options trader who, through years of unauthorized, secret trading in Japanese derivatives, brought down Barings Bank in 1995 with a cumulative loss of about \u20ac800m, more than their entire trading capital."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-29T16:30:16Z", "title": "Why financial heists are getting bigger and we put less value on money", "tags": ["US personal finance", "US crime", "Financial sector", "Banking", "Banking reform", "Technology", "Dollar", "Currencies"], "article": "Greenpeace International, an environmental charity, just this month announced that one of its employees lost \u20ac3.8m while carrying out unauthorized foreign exchange trades. It&apos;s strange to see rogue trading at environmental charities, gambling away hard-earned money donated by idealists who spared time for Greenpeace\u2019s politely insistent representatives on street corners. Yet, actually, \u20ac3.8m isn\u2019t such a large sum. I was recently a participant in a panel in Mexico City that included Nick Leeson, the Singapore-based options trader who, through years of unauthorized, secret trading in Japanese derivatives, brought down Barings Bank in 1995 with a cumulative loss of about \u20ac800m, more than their entire trading capital.  Leeson was trying to cover up and recoup a small initial loss with increasingly giant bets, concealed by fake accounting, and then things accelerated.  &quot;What&quot;, the panel asked, &quot;can we do to avoid such situations in the future?&quot; The answer is: we can&apos;t. There have of course been many more such situations since 1995, including Jerome Kerviel, who in 2008 lost \u20ac4.9bn at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale through allegedly similar deceptions. Crooks are a fiat dime a dozen. Leeson\u2019s strategy, for all the glamor of trillion dollar losses, wasn\u2019t very different from the cleaning lady of a man I know. She came weekly and always drank a little of his vodka while he was out. Then she filled the depleted bottle with water to the previous level. He put up with it for the sake of her services, but he wasn\u2019t fooled. It was a fair trade. What is interesting about financial crooks as opposed to vodka embezzlers is that they can abscond with such vast sums and go unnoticed for so long.  What is it about money that makes it easier and easier to steal larger and larger sums as time goes by? Why do we see scandal after scandal of mind-bogglingly large sums frittered away in bad trades or theft on a scale that would have shocked previous generations? Money is insubstantial now. It used to be a solid thing \u2013 coins or paper. To create it you had to dig, smelt and cast, or at least print. You had to store it in a vault.  Then one day money became vaporous. When we lost our tactile connection to money, we also lost our sense of its psychological reality.   Not only are dollars now digital, but central banks, with suitable lubrication, ease out piles of it in order to bail out banks, corporations and governments. Money doesn&apos;t belong to people any more \u2013 there&apos;s always some sentinel of capitalism behind it, some faceless institution that makes us less connected to the impact of the loss of currency.  How can anyone have any respect for the idea of money, as opposed to money itself? To get back to my original point, it&apos;s only natural for people to treat it like the insubstantial, fictional thing it has become.  Embezzlers and central banks show money the same disrespect. The endless runs of stimulus, the billions and trillions being racked up at the Federal Reserve and other central banks, show that money is not taken seriously.  Even bank architecture supports this idea. When I was a kid in the British Commonwealth, banks were imposing temples, ornate teller cages on marble floors sheltered by vast vaulted ceilings. Working in a bank was a profession one could aspire to. Being a teller was a good, if boring, lifetime job, straight out of an Orwell novel like Keep the Aspidistra Flying. Armed guards stood by, ready to try to shoot anyone who dared attempt the bank\u2019s precious vault. It didn\u2019t seem strange to be asked to give your life for a stack of gold bars that had been created at great cost. Now armed guards are gone. Customer services sit in the open at formica counters with trays of dog biscuits and lollipops. There are cash machines in every convenience store, unguarded. If your credit card is stolen, your bank will refund you the money that thieves take. You\u2019d be a fool, an idiot actually, to die to protect money any bank could replace. Money isn\u2019t serious any more. Expect to see a lot more of it disappear."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jun/30/barclays-bank-profits-luxembourg-14-staff", "sentences": ["Singapore is next with 4,000 employees, turnover of \u00a3866m but profits of \u00a3141m and corporation tax of \u00a36m."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-30T17:42:04Z", "title": "Barclays made \u00a31.4bn profits in Luxembourg \u2013 \u00a3100m for each worker", "tags": ["Barclays", "Banking", "Business", "Luxembourg", "Europe", "World news", "Tax and spending", "Politics", "Tax avoidance", "Corporate governance"], "article": "The Luxembourg operations of Barclays, through which of much of the bank&apos;s controversial tax planning services are channelled, generated \u00a31.4bn of profits in 2013 \u2013 \u00a3100m for each of the 14 people employed there. In published details about the turnover, tax and headcount of the main countries in which its operates, Barclays also revealed it paid just \u00a320m of tax in Luxembourg. Barclays&apos; chief executive, Antony Jenkins, pledged in February 2013 to close down the bank&apos;s tax avoidance unit, known as structured capital markets (SCM), as part of his efforts to clean up the reputation of the bank. However, he said the process would take several years. Much of the SCM activity was driven through Luxembourg. Lord Lawson, the former Conservative chancellor, described the business as orchestrating tax avoidance on an &quot;industrial scale&quot;. The data was published by Barclays to comply with a new European Union directive and refers to the 2013 calendar year. Barclays said its turnover in Luxembourg for 2014 should be lower. &quot;Whilst Luxembourg will continue to be an important location for our investment banking business, our operations there are changing following the closure of the structured capital markets unit. Those changes mean the 2014 snapshot is expected to show significantly reduced turnover,&quot; the bank said. Barclays reported profits of \u00a32.8bn for 2013, a total headcount of 140,282 and turnover of \u00a336bn. Its new &quot;country snapshot&quot; shows Luxembourg was the most profitable country after the UK, where it reported \u00a34.9bn of profits. But Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, calculated that the UK operations of Barclays, which employs 54,595 people, made a \u00a31.4bn loss. The bank said the total figure for the UK included \u00a33bn dividends paid by other countries and \u00a32.4bn gains on internal reorganisations were stripped out. &quot;This is why we have not made a larger corporation tax payment [in the UK] in 2013,&quot; Barclays said. Barclays paid \u00a355m of corporation tax in the UK \u2013 less than the \u00a3226m of corporation tax it paid in South Africa and the \u00a3215m it handed over in the United States. The bank, which said it paid \u00a31.4bn of tax in the UK if all taxes were included, said it had an obligation to shareholders not to pay more tax than it owed: &quot;Tax influences decisions about how we organise and run our businesses, and about where we base our operations or hold assets. &quot;Making these decisions is an integral part of running a commercial organisation and where tax is a factor in deciding where or how we do business, we ensure there is a genuine substance to the activity we conduct in each country&quot;. &quot;We do not seek to avoid paying our share and are proud of the contribution we make,&quot; Barclays added. Globally Barclays paid \u00a3830m of corporation tax, \u00a3730m of social security payments and other items to give a total tax bill of \u00a33.4bn. The bank lists Jersey, with 285 staff, as having the fifth-highest turnover of \u00a3972m, profits of \u00a3801m and paying corporation tax of \u00a39m.

There\u2019s the Fes festival, a leading world music festival, and the snappily named Jazzablanca in Casablanca. But the biggest ones are the funkier Gnaoua festival in Essaouira on the coast, the massive pop Festival Mawazine in Rabat \u2013 which has starred the likes of Rihanna and Stevie Wonder \u2013 and Timitar in Agadir. Each attracts crowds of up to 500,000 people (that\u2019s three times the size of Glastonbury). All of them, too, are not just music festivals \u2013 they have specific social and political agendas as well.   Timitar, which I went to the weekend before Glastonbury, is a case in point. That was where I saw a rapper called Muslim \u2013 a great name if you don\u2019t want to be Googled \u2013 appearing at an event that is at root a celebration of Berber culture.  Muslim\u2019s best-known song, which he delivered to a crowd of more than 100,000 at the \u201curban\u201d stage in Place Bijawane near the beach, is Al Rissala (The Letter) a fiery anti-authoritarian condemnation of corruption and ignorance in high places. On another stage, Alpha Blondy\u2019s 10-piece reggae band was singing about \u201cspiritual terrorists\u201d who think it\u2019s OK to kill in the name of religion. The next night, local heroine Najat Atabou was singing songs in support of women\u2019s rights in a more traditional style, while Mehdi Nassouli was positively postmodern, almost Prog Berber. In previous years at the festival I&apos;d caught Marcel Khalife, a Palestinian who sings rousing revolutionary songs, and the rock band Hoba Hoba Spirit, whose Will To Live \u2013 a setting of a poem written in the 1930s \u2013 became an anthem for the demonstrations in Morocco a couple of years ago.             \u201cIt\u2019s a good way of letting off steam,\u201d Reda Allali, the lead singer Hoba Hoba Spirit, told me of Timitar. \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction anyway \u2013 although there are many steps ahead.\u201d Berber culture has been historically oppressed in these parts, even though Berbers make up nearly half of Moroccans and are the indigenous population; the origins of their music go back millennia before the arrival of the Arabs.   Some, like the Saharan-Berber singer Malika Zarra, now based in New York, see Timitar as a &quot;bread-and-circuses&quot; distraction from the issues that have caused Berber uprisings across North Africa (\u201cThey had to do it,\u201d asserts Zarra), but it\u2019s also true the Moroccan authorities are cannier and more flexible than more blatantly repressive regimes elsewhere, which may be one reason the country is more stable than its neighbours. Another reason is the unifying force of the seemingly universally revered king, Mohammed VI, whose picture was on the side of Timitar\u2019s main stage. The authorities have also taken practical steps to reduce Berber unrest in the last few years, setting up a Berber TV station and introducing the teaching of the language in schools. The word Berber, a foreign-imported word derived from barbarian, is also falling from use, being replaced by Amizagh, which means free man (we&apos;re using it in this article simply for clarity). The oldest of the big four Moroccan festivals is the Fes festival of World Sacred Music, which has a different political agenda and marked its 20th anniversary last week. Fes was the destination for many of the Muslims and Jews who were kicked out of Spain in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the festival represents a kind of nostalgia for the great days of the old Andalucia, where Christians, Jews and Muslims lived more or less in harmony. The festival was set up in the wake of the first Gulf war as a \u201cbeacon of tolerance\u201d and has a policy of inviting top-notch performers from different faiths and of no faith. There\u2019s usually a leftfield western star like Bj\u00f6rk, who appeared a couple of years back, or Patti Smith, who appeared last year. This year\u2019s big performer was Iraq\u2019s top pop star Kadim Al-Sahir.            There are plenty of countries, from Abu Dhabi to Singapore, who put money into the arts for political or economic reasons \u2013 in the case of Singapore, it\u2019s to attract foreign companies to set up their offices there, for Abu Dhabi it is partly to distinguish itself from its racier, naughtier sister Dubai. For Morocco, the main reason, apart from bread and circuses distraction and creating employment, it\u2019s to rebrand the country as a whole a more tolerant, open Islamic country. Whatever the motive, they are fascinating festivals; and Fes in particular is, for my dirhams, the best world music festival anywhere."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/02/-sp-astronomy-photographer-of-the-year-2014-shortlist-in-pictures", "sentences": ["Photograph: Justin Ng/Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2014    Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower over Mount Bromo by Justin Ng (Singapore)."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-02T12:06:50Z", "title": "Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2014: the shortlist - in pictures", "tags": ["Astronomy", "Space", "Science", "Photography", "Travel", "Art", "Culture"], "article": "   Photograph: Dr Claus Possberg/Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2014    Celestial Dance by Dr Claus Possberg (Germany).

After all, it can mean fresher and healthier foods, stronger local economies, direct contact with food producers and in some cases \u2014 but not always \u2014 lower carbon emissions.  But most of us have only a few options for participating in the local food movement: visiting the farmers market or signing up for a community supported agriculture (CSA) subscription. As the movement continues to grow and evolve, however, social entrepreneurs are experimenting with novel ways to make local agriculture an integral part of urban life. Here are 10 of the most intriguing projects currently underway: GrowUp Box, London, UK     In a 20-foot shipping container, GrowUp Box farms tilapia in tanks and uses the waste to fertilize greens, which are cultivated in vertical columns. Photograph: GrowUp Box    Kate Hofman and Tom Webster are giving new meaning to the phrase &quot;box lunch&quot; with their reinvented shipping container, the GrowUp Box. Inside the 20-foot container, tilapia are farmed in tanks specially designed to ensure the fish enough room to grow, while on top, greens are cultivated in vertical columns. The water from the tilapia tanks circulates through the columns, where the fish waste provides nourishment to about 400 plants. The fish and greens are sold to area restaurants. The project&apos;s parent company, GrowUp Urban Farms, consults with people looking to build their own boxes and is set to start building the first commercial-scale aquaponics farm in London soon, Hofman said. Beacon Food Forest, Seattle, Washington, US     This Seattle project, called the Beacon Food Forest, is turning public land into an edible forest where residents can forage for fruits, pumpkins and nuts. Photograph: Beacon Food Forest    Opening to the public this spring, the Beacon Food Forest in Seattle is turning a piece of public land into an edible forest garden. Residents will be welcome to forage in the forest, a 7-acre plot \u2014 adjacent to a city park \u2014 featuring fruit and nut trees, a pumpkin patch and dozens of berry bushes. The goal is to mimic a natural ecosystem, creating a space that requires less maintenance and offers higher yields, co-founder Glenn Herlihy says.

Farmery, North Carolina and TBA, US     The Farmery, slated to open this fall in an as-yet-undisclosed location, will be an 8,000-square-foot market that will grow its own mushrooms, greens and fruits. Photograph: Amy Edwards/Farmery    Benjamin Greene, founder of the Farmery, plans to make the journey from farm to store more efficient by eliminating it almost entirely.  The Farmery will be an 8,000-square-foot market with food shopping on the lower level and mushrooms, greens and fruits growing on the upper level. Whatever is not grown on site will be sourced locally.  A smaller, Kickstarter-funded prototype \u2014 what Greene calls &quot;a souped-up produce stand&quot; \u2014 is currently in operation in Durham, North Carolina, and the first full-scale store is coming this fall, Greene says. The location, however, is being kept under wraps for now. Sky Greens, Lim Chu Kang area, Singapore     Sky Greens grows lettuce, spinach and a variety of Asian greens on a tall, narrow A-frame structure that slowly rotates the plants to make sure they get enough sunlight. Photograph: Sky Greens    Singapore, one of the most densely populated nations in the world, has little room available for farming. So inventor and entrepreneur Jack Ng created the Sky Greens system to grow more food in less space. Think of it as a plant skyscraper. The equipment (see photo above) holds up to 32 trays of greens \u2014 including lettuce, spinach and a variety of Asian greens \u2014 on a tall, narrow A-frame structure. The plants slowly rotate, as if on a Ferris wheel, so each tray gets sufficient exposure to sunlight. Sky Greens, which launched commercial operations in October 2012, harvests and delivers vegetables to Singaporean markets every day. Brooklyn Grange, Brooklyn, New York, US The Brooklyn Grange comprises two and a half acres of growing space high atop a pair of office buildings. &quot;We&apos;re looking at ways to increase food production without increasing agricultural footprint,&quot; spokeswoman Anastasia Plakias says.  The operation grows more than 50,000lbs of food each year, which it sells through farmers markets, CSA subscriptions and wholesale accounts. In addition to boosting New York City&apos;s local food supply, the farm also absorbs more than 1m gallons of stormwater every year, reducing the load the city&apos;s systems must manage.

Photograph: Deu Horta Na Telha    After 30 years of building urban gardens in S\u00e3o Paulo, agricultural technician Marcos Victorino started running out of cultivable land.  As part of his research work at local college Faculdade Cantareira, he designed a way to turn roofs, balconies and paved areas across the city into miniature farms. Victorino turns large roof tiles upside down, creating a long, V-shaped trough that can be filled with soil.  These tile beds are elevated, making them easily accessible to children and the handicapped. Because the tiles are watertight, they hold in moisture, allowing growers to make the most of an increasingly limited water supply.  Prinzessinnengarten, Berlin, Germany     In the shadow of the former Berlin wall, a wide range of vegetables grows in repurposed Tetra Paks, rice sacks and plastic crates. Photograph: Prinzessinnengarten    The Prinzessinnengarten is an urban farm nestled in the shadow of the former Berlin Wall, between unused subway stops, graffiti-ed concrete walls and aging apartment blocks. Inside vine-covered fences grows a wide range of vegetables, all planted in easy-to-move containers \u2014 recycled Tetra Paks, rice sacks, and plastic crates \u2014 that allow the entire operation to be moved if needed. Visitors can pick vegetables, learn about seed harvesting and vegetable pickling, or visit the caf\u00e9 to enjoy snacks made from the garden&apos;s produce.  Urban Organics, St. Paul, Minnesota, US     In a former commercial brewery, Urban Organics uses aquaponics - a system in which fish waste fertilizes plants - to supply salad greens and fish to area grocery stores and restaurants. Photograph: /Urban Organics    Located in a building formerly occupied by a commercial brewery, Urban Organics is an aquaponics operation that provides salad greens and fish to grocery stores and restaurants using just 2% of the water of conventional agriculture. Founder Fred Haberman, CEO of Minneapolis marketing agency Haberman, hopes the for-profit farm will prove the commercial viability of aquaponics and help spur economic development in the area. &quot;If we can do that, I believe you\u2019ll see more of these types of facilities popping up,&quot; he said. Lufa Farms, Montreal, Canada     Lufa Farms has two sprawling rooftop greenhouses that produce greens, herbs, peppers and eggplants, which it delivers to approximately 4,000 customers each week. Photograph: Lufa Farms    The goal of Lufa Farms in Montreal is to create a &quot;local food engine&quot;, says the company&apos;s greenhouse director Lauren Rathmell.  At the heart of the operation are two sprawling rooftop greenhouses \u2014 currently totaling 1.75 acres \u2014 that produce a range of vegetables: greens and herbs, peppers and eggplants. The produce is packaged with locally sourced goods like handmade pastas, fresh bread and dark baking chocolate, and delivered to approximately 4,000 customers each week. And the business isn&apos;t stopping there: It has two more greenhouses in the works.

When her friends put up their hair, they wore the red clothing of brides. But as Liang left her girlhood behind and stepped across\u00a0the family threshold, she was embarking on a lifelong commitment to remain single. At 85, Liang is a rare survivor of a custom stretching back to the early 19th century in parts of southern Guangdong. Women here could vow to remain a &quot;self-combed woman&quot;, or zishun\u00fc, leaving their parents&apos; home to work without marrying. &quot;If I hadn&apos;t become a &apos;self-combed woman&apos;, the landlord would have forced me into marriage,&quot; she said. Pretty girls were often forcibly taken as wives or concubines. It happened to two of her friends, and they killed themselves. Becoming a zishun\u00fc gave women an unusual degree of independence in a world that allowed them little education, voice or freedom. But it came at a heavy price. They toiled in factories or other people&apos;s homes to support their families. Women who broke their pledge of celibacy were supposed to kill themselves, though by Liang&apos;s era, such expectations had largely disappeared. The words recited with the eight strokes of the comb hint at the uneven path ahead: &quot;First comb for luck, second for longevity, third for contentment, fourth for safety. Fifth for freedom \u2026&quot; Shatou village, Shunde, was once a centre of this practice. Down an alleyway, tucked behind the high modern white-tiled homes, lies a two-storey grey building with an elegant courtyard before it. In front of its gate, mulberry trees sprawl inside a red-brick wall. The Hall of Ice and Jade \u2013 named after\u00a0the saying &quot;as pure as jade, as unsullied as ice&quot; \u2013 was built to shelter these women in old age, although it is now a museum. Liang is tiny \u2013 perhaps 142cm (4ft 8in) \u2013 and fine-boned. She sits on a bench, swinging feet in black galoshes, beside Huang Li-e, a 90-year-old with a\u00a0mischievous smile and an aptitude for\u00a0teasing. They have never had husbands, children \u2013 or second thoughts. &quot;No regrets,&quot; they say in unison. &quot;A lot of men chased after me,&quot; Liang added, with a shooing motion: &quot;I told them to go away.&quot; The custom was one form of &quot;marriage resistance&quot; in the Pearl river delta. Others included &quot;delayed marriage&quot;: wives would not move to their husband&apos;s home or have sex with him for the first few years. It may have emerged because Shunde was a silk production centre, giving women opportunities in the factories. The area also placed a heavy emphasis on female chastity, said Ye Ziling, who has interviewed many survivors, possibly helping to ensure the women&apos;s vows were respected. While they chose to become self-combed, even running away to do so when their parents disapproved, most came from poor households. &quot;Often, their families couldn&apos;t offer good dowries. Their status would be even lower than an ordinary girl&apos;s in their new family,&quot; said Ye. &quot;They were also the eldest daughters and might already be the main labourer. Their siblings had not grown up to replace them and, if they married, the main income source was gone.&quot; Others became self-combed because factories refused to hire those they feared might marry and give birth.     Liang Jieyun, 85, and Huang Li-e, 90, are rarities as zishun\u00fc and have never had a husband or children. Photograph: Tania Branigan for the Guardian    &quot;Women were afraid of marrying a bad man,&quot; said Liang, adding that local men gambled and smoked opium. &quot;If you got married, you had to give birth to children and raise them and work very hard for the family.&quot; Women who married joined their husband&apos;s family, at the bottom of the hierarchy. &quot;All their labour went to the in-laws and became their duty. The in-law family would never be grateful; it was what was supposed to be done. Their status was very low,&quot; said Ye. In contrast, self-combed women could enjoy the gratitude of brothers and take pride in their contribution. Because of their long working hours, factory workers often slept by their machines. In Zhaoqing, another town in the Pearl river delta, they lived as a community. Some are thought to have formed romantic or sexual relationships. When the Wall Street Crash led to the collapse of the silk industry, many went to Singapore as servants. Huang spent decades there, sending money home to her brother and nephew. &quot;We never thought about ourselves. We never did anything for ourselves,&quot; she said. While some see the custom as a daring challenge to strict Confucian patriarchy, others think it more complex. &quot;Superficially, it looks very different to what we thought about traditional Chinese women. People tend to think it was a phenomenon of rebellion,&quot; said Ye. &quot;It&apos;s true that women did choose to be zishun\u00fc. But almost all of them emphasised the relationship with their natural family and very traditional values such as filial piety.&quot; The practice began to die out as the clan system disintegrated amid the turmoil of the 30s and 40s. The marriage law passed by the new Communist state in 1950 rang its final death knell by raising the minimum marital age, banning polygamy and forced or arranged matches, and granting women equality. Some of Liang&apos;s peers married, but most of those who had taken the vow continued to live by it, sending home half their income or more. One sent 80% of her earnings every month, said Ye. Decades later, some could recall each word of their letters from home: proof of a rare indulgence on the part of workers who otherwise scraped by. Illiterate, they paid other people to reread the letters until they knew them by heart.     The Hall of Ice and Jade was built to shelter the 'self-combed women' in old age, although it is now a museum. Photograph: Tania Branigan for the Guardian    With no pensions, some adopted daughters to look after them in their old age. Others sent home a portion of their wages to construct the red-tiled pillars and aqua arches of the Hall of Ice and Jade. It still holds the memorial tablets of the dead. Having left their families, their names could not stand alongside those of their parents. But the last resident moved out years ago. Now Shatou&apos;s 10 remaining zishun\u00fc live with nephews and nieces or in care homes, with government allowances. Some of the 12 children Liang raised for employers come to visit her. She feels no envy for today&apos;s women and their unimaginable choices. &quot;It&apos;s still hard to find a good man,&quot; said Liang. If a man is poor, his wife will have to struggle; if a man is rich, he may take a mistress, she said. She leant forward. &quot;Good for you,&quot; she added. &quot;You have an education, and you&apos;ve travelled.&quot; Additional research by Cecily Huang"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/03/guardian-view-arrest-nicolas-sarkozy", "sentences": ["In France itself, the socialist budget minister resigned last year after the discovery that he held hundreds of thousands of euros in Swiss and Singapore bank accounts."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-03T18:59:46Z", "title": "The Guardian view on the arrest of Nicolas Sarkozy | Editorial", "tags": ["Nicolas Sarkozy", "World news", "France", "Europe", "Politics"], "article": "In one sense, the arrest of Nicolas Sarkozy in Paris this week can be seen as just the latest, albeit very high-profile, example of a continuing international investigative effort against financial abuse in Europe&apos;s political processes. Senior politicians have faced corruption grillings in Germany, Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland and Britain in recent years and in many cases paid the price. In France itself, the socialist budget minister resigned last year after the discovery that he held hundreds of thousands of euros in Swiss and Singapore bank accounts. In that sense, the arrest of Mr Sarkozy \u2013 who denies all the charges \u2013 may not say anything unique about either France itself or the former president&apos;s right-of-centre political party. Yet the arrest is surely a milestone in both of these contexts. Past French presidents were plagued by corruption allegations during and after their terms of office. None, however, was subjected to the 15-hour police station detention to which Mr Sarkozy was subjected this week. None was placed under notice of investigation for &quot;active corruption&quot;, as Mr Sarkozy has now been. This could either mean that the charges \u2013 which include allegations of accepting huge campaign donations from the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi in 2007 \u2013 are far more serious than those that dogged Presidents Giscard, Mitterrand and Chirac. Or it could mean that a bar has simply been raised, and that French public life has begun to get more transparent than it was in the past \u2013 a possibility also signalled by the recent treatment of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s private life. Realistically, the arrest might already mark the end, or the beginning of the end, of Mr Sarkozy&apos;s time in the top rank of French politics \u2013 which would become certain if Mr Sarkozy ended up with the 10-year jail sentence that is the maximum punishment for the corruption charge. It comes just as the former president was beginning his manoeuvres to regain control of the Gaullist UMP later this year, which could be a stepping stone towards a credible presidential run against Mr Hollande in 2017 and a possible Sarkozy restoration. Both the arrest and the timing are helpful to the currently unpopular Mr Hollande, which inevitably raises suspicions on the right. Hoping to mirror Mr Chirac&apos;s landslide win in 2002 against Jean-Marie Le Pen, when the socialists were in disarray, Mr Hollande would probably prefer a second-round run-off in three years&apos; time against Marine Le Pen rather than against a resurgent Mr Sarkozy or a lesser UMP personality such as Alain Jupp\u00e9. So the consequences of this week&apos;s events could be very large and very damaging for France. That&apos;s no reason for the investigation not to take its course. But the stakes are very high, particularly at a time when Europe \u2013 including a febrile Britain \u2013 needs a stable and outward-looking France."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/04/help-african-entrepreneurs-roundtable", "sentences": ["It was agreed that the economic growth seen elsewhere \u2013 in China, Singapore or Thailand, for instance \u2013 would not be easy to replicate."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T09:40:00Z", "title": "How do we help Africa's entrepreneurs?", "tags": ["Tackling youth unemployment", "Global development professionals network", "Africa", "Employment", "Entrepreneurs"], "article": "Across the African continent, entrepreneurs are starting every size, and every type, of business. Many countries have resounding declarations about entrepreneurial culture, and want the solutions to poverty and unemployment to be entrepreneurial, but what does this mean in practice? What are the challenges for African entrepreneurs? What have been the successes so far? And what steps \u2013 large and small - need to be taken to ensure that people starting their own businesses have the best possible chance of success? These were among the issues addressed in a roundtable event held recently at the Guardian and sponsored by Barclays. Senior representatives of business, academia, NGOs, and the financial sector gathered to discuss entrepreneurship in Africa. There were several points of contention right from the start. The first was: did the whole way the political and economic system was organised in Africa need to be addressed to make any worthwhile changes? Or were programmes improveing the situations of the poorest people the best way to go? David Bull from Unicef said his organisation considers the lack of livelihoods for young people one of the world&apos;s most significant challenges. &quot;A quarter of young people in Africa are out of work and education. This is both a waste and dangerous,&quot; he stressed. &quot;If they have nothing constructive to do, they are at risk of drugs, gangs, and radicalism, with an impact on themselves and on society.&quot; The Building Young Futures project, run by Unicef and Barclays, is targeting 74,000 young people in six countries, working with government and other organisations to provide young people with the skills and confidence to start their own businesses, with Barclays staff in those countries acting as mentors. A need for scale?But Greg Fischer from the London School of Economics questioned whether such projects were really the answer. &quot;There has never been a history of any country developing where it is about low-skilled people starting a business. Entrepreneurship is about highly skilled people,&quot; he said. While micro and small-scale enterprises were worthy development goals, the issue was how to get larger enterprises to work well. Michael Hastings of KPMG talked about what he considered the single most significant systemic reason that entrepreneurship was not developing in Africa: very high interest rates. &quot;The banking interest rate for business is 26-29% on average,&quot; he observed. &quot;The continent is flush with opportunity, with ideas, it is highly educated, there&apos;s a consumer boom, opportunities galore, infrastructure, investment from China, but a person wanting to expand from selling eggs to selling meringues to British supermarkets can&apos;t get the investment capital they need. That is systemic failure.&quot; Governments were also blamed for other failings. &quot;One of the major challenges is around economic diversification \u2013 the depth and breadth of GDP,&quot; said Katherine Tweedie of Investec Investment Institute. Many of the world&apos;s fastest-growing economies are in Africa, but they are generally founded on natural resources, such as oil. It&apos;s governments&apos; challenge to develop economies away from their dependence on resources. Governance, transparency and corruption were also cited as obstacles to growth, as well as a lack of security and social capital. &quot;What are the implications when people don&apos;t trust each other?&quot; asked Solene Dengler of the Legatum Institute. It was not simply that there may be high levels of corruption and low levels of security, but that people don&apos;t build synergies that could help entrepreneurship flourish. There are, however, examples where an across-the-board programme looks at a wide range of entrepreneurial challenges and how to tackle them. Lianne Miller, from Anglia Ruskin&apos;s Centre for Enterprise, Development and Research, has been working on an international project with Barclays Africa Group to embed entrepreneurship in South Africa and Zimbabwe. Ten pilot businesses \u2013 with between two and 70 employees \u2013 have been mentored and brought to the UK to gain an international perspective on how they can expand into global markets. What were the key barriers to expansion? For the smaller companies, it was confidence; the larger companies experienced more logistical problems. &quot;They are now being taken seriously by investors,&quot; she said. Tailored solutionsBut what sort of entrepreneur was being discussed? Participants agreed that an individual selling tomatoes by the side of the road would face different obstacles to a factory owner looking to export their goods internationally. Karina Wong of Impact Investing spoke about the spectrum of entrepreneurs \u2013 from micro, through middle and needing to grow to smaller corporates. Each has different capital and investment needs, she said: &quot;The range of financial products available in the UK that might be appropriate for businesses at different stages simply don&apos;t exist.&quot; So what about young people? Andrew Rogerson, a board member of Plan UK, referred to recent research the organisation had carried out on youth savings group programmes, including Banking on Change \u2013 a partnership between Plan UK, Care International UK and Barclays. Plan&apos;s evidence shows that young people lack access to financial services, capital, confidence, basic human capital, entrepreneurial skills and networks, and are hamstrung by social norms that want to keep them powerless. &quot;You can get round part of the problem by forming credible savings groups,&quot; he said. Lucy Hayter spoke about the Cherie Blair Foundation&apos;s work, carried out in association with Accenture and Care International in Rwanda. Working with female micro and small entrepreneurs, offering them online and face-to-face mentoring, and business skills the foundation aims to help 15,000 women over the next two years. Rachel Barton from Accenture spoke about its collaborative work with the Cherie Blair Foundation, including a grant of nearly $2million for the Rwanda project. An escape from povertyDavid Bull reiterated the importance of entrepreneurialism for the poorest, by moving people away from deep poverty. &quot;That is where we make the absolutely biggest difference in terms of infant mortality, education and so on,&quot; he said. Larger-scale change is important to the economy but it doesn&apos;t necessarily help these young people in the short term. &quot;We can&apos;t wait 20 years for economic growth to happen,&quot; he continued. So what else did participants suggest as solutions to the economic challenges faced by Africa? Were there any examples of things that had worked particularly well so far? It was agreed that the economic growth seen elsewhere \u2013 in China, Singapore or Thailand, for instance \u2013 would not be easy to replicate. One big focus was on leveraging the talent and skills that exists both across the continent, and in the diaspora. Harveen Chugh works at UK Trade and Investment to bring graduate entrepreneurs with businesses across the world to the UK to set up offices. &quot;Entrepreneurship is about recognising opportunities and understanding how to exploit them,&quot; she said. &quot;We can bring in expertise from all over the world, investors and entrepreneurs looking for new opportunities.&quot; Winifred Adeyemi, who set up her own company Africa: Seen and Heard, spoke about the large numbers of highly educated African graduates who were un- or under-employed, or who were working outside the continent because they were not able to find jobs that used their skills. She was interested in finding a way to match suitable graduates with human resource departments: &quot;Then we would find a lot of leadership that is lacking could be created within the countries. It is important to create and incubate the potential leaders of the future,&quot; she said. Another potential solution was for more collaborative working across banks, NGOs and other organisations. This would require organisations and individuals to set aside egos and abandon &quot;brand advantage&quot; to simply work together for the good of the whole. With many at the table already working in collaborations, this was seen as something that should be built upon. As Richard Phelps from Barclays said in conclusion: &quot;This is a huge opportunity. We are all doing our bit. If we can all come together, it will be a major step forward.&quot; Key discussion points Traditional employment patterns across the world are changing and ever more people are looking to start their own businesses. This is particularly true in Africa, where entrepreneurship is seen by many governments as the way economies will grow. But entrepreneurs, big and small, face a raft of challenges. While micro enterprises might be able to earn the money to take family members out of the deepest poverty, will they be able to grow beyond that? And what about the larger companies looking to expand, perhaps into other countries or continents? What is holding them back? How can Africa expand in a way that best suits all its citizens?

But this is a world away from the din of the pit and the north-east&apos;s traditional heavy industry. In these offices, twentysomething graduates work quietly at desks on an industry that is &quot;weightless&quot;. Rainton Bridge is the base of an ever-increasing number of software start-ups, and the business of a set of enterprising Sunderland brothers who rode the dotcom boom at the turn of the century, starting the process which has helped to make Sunderland one of the fastest-growing software hubs outside London. New research last week revealed that the north-east ICT sector now employs over 32,000 people, with 1,500 new jobs created this year. Sunderland Software City (SSC), a partnership between the public and private sector and the University of Sunderland, has ambitions for the north-east to be home to 2,200 software companies by 2020, contributing over \u00a31bn to the regional economy, double the UK annual growth rate. In Sunderland itself, SSC has supported over 300 software businesses since it began operating in 2009, and helped 150 start-ups. It aims to see a threefold increase in businesses and revenues in Sunderland before 2020, with a creation of 2,000 new software jobs. &quot;But this industry is still in its infancy and needs supporting,&quot; said David Dunn, SSC&apos;s chief executive. Unusually, Sunderland&apos;s whole software sector can be traced back to a band of brothers, the Callaghans, who formed web agency Leighton in 1992 in their native city. Out of this grew the company DomainNames in 1996, which rapidly grew to become the biggest registrar of .com domains in Europe. DomainNames was sold in a multimillion-pound deal to American giant Verisign in 2000. &quot;That was a good time to sell because it was just before the bubble burst,&quot; said Paul Callaghan, co-founder of the Leighton Group, now an umbrella organisation of five technology firms. Since selling DomainNames, Leighton has gone on to launch and sell other successful software businesses, including 4projects, a virtual host for construction projects used in the development of the Olympic Stadium. But back in the early 2000s, Leighton opened an office in Canada purely for developers. &quot;At that point we were starting to grow but we were finding that we couldn&apos;t get enough staff here,&quot; said Callaghan. &quot;Universities were creating graduates but they were all being attracted to the south. The University of Sunderland was, at that point, one of the major suppliers for Microsoft down in Reading.&quot; So Callaghan sat down with the university in 2005 to think about how they could build a workforce in Sunderland. Callaghan aimed to &quot;try and create in the north-east not just a few businesses \u2026 but try to create an industry.&quot; &quot;When I did my O-Levels, if you said what were the industries of the north-east, you&apos;d say coal, shipbuilding and steel. Now they&apos;re all effectively gone. So I wanted in 25 years someone to say &apos;software&apos;,&quot; he added. A lack of infrastructure was preventing start-ups from flourishing in the region. In response, Sunderland council opened the Evolve Business Centre in Rainton Bridge Business Park in 2006, tailored specifically for the needs of growing tech firms. &quot;You can walk in and they will find you an office within weeks. They will plug you in and be up and away,&quot; said Callaghan. The centre has since incubated over 100 companies. Funding was also an issue. &quot;If I go back to the early noughties, if you wanted to raise money on a business I&apos;d say get a train ticket to London,&quot; said Callaghan. It was One North East, the now defunct regional development agency, that stumped up \u00a3125m to support start-up firms. &quot;Start-up costs in IT are the cost of a couple of servers,&quot; said Callaghan. &quot;So if you had \u00a360,000 or \u00a370,000 you could actually develop an idea to the next stage.&quot; As well as forming SSC, David Dunn thinks these decisions began to spawn an &quot;eco-system&quot;, with new companies springing up in clusters. Nowhere is that more apparent than at the Leighton Group, which is a focal point for some of Sunderland&apos;s most dramatic tech success stories. Dominic Edmunds joined Leighton in 1999, and set up SaleCycle four years ago. It works with big retailers to re-market items which are added to online shopping baskets but not bought by customers. Its success has been rapid; SaleCycle now has offices in the USA, Singapore, Paris and Sydney. Edmunds is bullish about what this means for the city. &quot;Sunderland and the North East\u00a0were\u00a0soaked in traditional industries that haven&apos;t stood the test of time. As such, the likes of Sunderland have been written off somewhat in the national press,&quot; he said. \u00a0&quot;What&apos;s changing that is a younger generation of entrepreneurs determined to create new industry across the region.&quot; Kevin Beales, managing director of the Test Factory, worked at Leighton before setting up on his own in 2008. It too now has a raft of global offices, providing online testing facilities for Microsoft and Google, and has grown to over 50 staff. &quot;There&apos;s a pool of innovation that&apos;s come from there [Leighton], and there&apos;s probably a legacy that goes back to one person who originally started the first business here,&quot; said Lizzie Withington, the Test Factory&apos;s head of corporate solutions. &quot;You&apos;re able to create a bit of a community feel. We&apos;ve been able to create this ecosystem of innovation and harbour great talent for people who may not really fancy the bright lights of London.&quot; The University of Sunderland, part of SSC, has created The Hatchery, a base for students to start-up their own software companies. 20 companies &apos;hatch&apos; each year. &quot;We encourage students to set up their own businesses. The Hatchery is a way of giving them the space and expertise to do that,&quot; said Dr. Alastair Irons, head of computing. The Sunderland Software Centre opened last year, a new \u00a310m city-centre base for start-ups. Dunn said the success of the Evolve Centre proved there was a demand for space. &quot;Regeneration of the city centre needs to be driven by bright young people spending money locally,&quot; he said. So why Sunderland? The answer may be very simple. &quot;We were born here,&quot; said Callaghan. &quot;If we hadn&apos;t have been born here there wouldn&apos;t have been a software industry started here in the early 90s.&quot; Callaghan sees no reason to move. &quot;Software is the weightless economy. Software hasn&apos;t got the economic geographical pull that traditional industries have. Ship-building had to be next to a river or a sea. Coal had to be where coal was,&quot; he said. &quot;I truly think it is down to the social, informal sector that has formed,&quot; said David Dunn. &quot;Essentially, in this industry you can work anywhere and for anyone. But the ecosystem here is valued.&quot; Robert Troughton, another Sunderland native, is founder of Pitbull Studio, a video games company which specialises in developing the Unreal Engine for American games giant Epic. &quot;We could be based in the middle of Ukraine,&quot; he said.&quot;If you can offer better value for your clients, then why not [Sunderland]? Why have a fancy office in Soho?&quot; The software industry will have to go some way to replace those Sunderland has lost, with shipbuilding alone employing 7500 workers in the 1970s. But SSC has ambitions plans, and it was the only software cluster invited to join the prime minister&apos;s trade visit to China last December. &quot;The reason was that we were representing 150+ companies,&quot; said Dunn. &quot;It&apos;s interesting that London Tech City wasn&apos;t there. I leave you to draw your own conclusions on that.&quot; Leighton Group     SaleCycle works with big retailers to re-market items which are added to online shopping baskets but not bought by customers. Photograph: Gary Calton    Leighton was formed in 1992 by Sunderland brothers Paul and Gerard Callaghan, who were joined by Chris Wilds when they founded DomainNames in 1996. They were joined by a third brother, Bernie, in 2000 who served as CEO. They started out in the 1980s as book publishers, before realising the potential of the internet and becoming an early web agency. The success of DomainNames saw offices open in the USA, Australia, South America and Hong Kong, and they became the biggest revenue generator of Freeserve, Britain&apos;s biggest ISP in the late 90s. Since selling to Verisign in 2000, Leighton has established other software businesses, like 4projects and e-mail communication business Communicator Corp, which was bought by TrinityMirror in 2011. It now describes itself as &quot;one of the UK&apos;s leading digital agencies with an international portfolio of clients,&quot; as well as taking a leading role in the creation of Sunderland Software City. They are based in the Rainton Bridge Business Park and employ 200 staff, with plans to take on another 300 over the next three years. SaleCycle SaleCycle is part of the Leighton Group and was formed four years ago by Dominic Edmunds, who joined Leighton straight from Teesside University in 1999. SaleCycle are &quot;re-marketing specialists&quot;, helping to track and recover abandoned online shopping baskets for companies. Customers can then be contacted via e-mail and onsite about their unbought goods. Their success has been rapid, with offices in the USA, Singapore, Sydney and Paris as well as their Sunderland HQ, and has grown to 60 staff with plans to take on another 110 in the next year. SaleCycle were paid in 43 different currencies last month. The Test Factory The Test Factory was formed in 2008 by Kevin Beales, a previous employee of Leighton, and is based in the Evolve Business Centre in Rainton Bridge Business Park. It builds recruitment and testing software for a range of huge companies, including Microsoft, Google and the BBC. It has now moved into the education sector, dealing with e-learning and e-assessment. The Test Factory has offices in London, the USA and Australia and has grown to over 50 staff, up from just a handful back in 2008. Pitbull Studio Pitbull Studio is a video games company formed in 2010 by programmer Robert Troughton, who had worked at the original Pitbull syndicate before it was bought by American company Midway Games in 2004. They went bust in 2009. It now has 45 high-end programmers, having grown from five when it formed. Pitbull specialise in the Unreal Engine, used by Epic Games, who are famous for the Unreal Tournament series, Bioshock and Gears of War. It is by-far the most commonly used engine in high-end AAA games, and Pitbull are currently working on developing Unreal Engine 4, its latest version, the only company doing so outside of Epic Games&apos; American HQ."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/jul/04/world-in-a-week-government-crackdown-on-christianity-in-china", "sentences": ["Shopping mall in Singapore found to be selling housemaids like commodities - Al Jazeera  Coming next week: have your say  Our live chat on Thursday 11 July is on taking technology projects to scale."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T16:35:45Z", "title": "World in a week: government crackdown on Christianity in China", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "World Bank", "United Nations", "Religion", "Christianity", "Somalia", "Malaria", "Zimbabwe", "Bolivia", "India", "Iraq", "Egypt", "Haiti"], "article": "Good week for Karen Mundy, formerly the associate dean of research at the University of Toronto, who has been appointed chief technical officer at the Global Partnership for Education.

Under the plans the new top tier of teachers could be awarded higher salaries by headteachers and would be regarded as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in the profession. The policy, announced on Sunday by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt, highlights the gulf between Labour&apos;s emphasis on the need for qualifications and experience, and education secretary Michael Gove&apos;s willingness to allow unqualified teachers to operate in free schools and academies. Labour has already announced that all teachers in state schools would have to be qualified if Labour were to win the next election. Hunt also announces on Sunday that they would have to choose one of three new career routes, specialising either in classroom teaching methods, curriculum development in chosen subjects, or pursuit of eventual leadership roles. The idea of master teachers as models of best practice \u2013 a system operating in Singapore \u2013 was recommended to Gove in a review on standards for the coalition government in 2011, but not taken forward. The title would be awarded to those who met standards to be set by an independent body. Pay levels would be at the discretion of headteachers. Hunt said that in Singapore teachers could see a career path at all stages and had incentives to stay in the profession \u2013 and in the classroom \u2013 rather than viewing a move into a non-teaching leadership role as the pinnacle. More emphasis should be placed on the best teaching. &quot;Day in, day out, it is the teachers in our classrooms who hold the greatest influence over the learning and development of our children,&quot; Hunt said. &quot;If we want to compete with the rising powers of the east, we should learn from their success. That&apos;s what Labour is doing.&quot; Labour has already set out plans, resisted by some unions, under which teachers would have to be relicensed every few years to continue working in state schools. Unqualified teachers who have been able to work in state schools under Gove&apos;s reforms would also have to leave the profession unless they gained a formal qualification within two years. Dame Sally Coates, the outgoing head of Burlington Danes Academy in west London, who chaired the review of teachers&apos; standards in 2011 for Gove, welcomed Labour&apos;s move. &quot;We need to keep the exceptional teachers in the classroom. It will give all teachers something to aspire to,&quot; she said. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, which represents 160,000 teachers, supply teachers, heads, lecturers, managers and support staff in maintained and independent schools and colleges, also backed the idea, saying it could help stem an alarming exodus of teachers. &quot;This government has tended to overestimate the role of leadership in schools and to underestimate the role of teachers in the classroom. We are facing the prospect of a recruitment crisis in schools and we need to do all we can to reverse that while also keeping the best teachers in the classroom.&quot; But Bousted said that there should be nationally determined pay grades for the new master teachers as well as better career development for all teachers aspiring to reach the new top tier. Figures from the Department for Education released in April showed a sharp jump in the number of unqualified teachers in state schools from 14,800 in 2012 to 17,100 in November last year. The number of frontline staff without qualified teaching status employed by academies and free schools rose during the same period by 2,600 to nearly 8,000 \u2013 meaning nearly 6% of the 141,000 full-time teaching staff at both types of school lack teaching accreditation. In free schools, teachers without qualified teaching status represent 13% of 1,500 full-time teachers. Across all state schools, including free schools and academies, just 3.8% are unqualified. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg has joined those demanding that all teachers in state schools should be qualified. The head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, also made clear to a Commons committee in 2012 that he believed teachers should be qualified: &quot;I would expect all the teachers in my school to have qualified teacher status,&quot; he said. A Department for Education spokesperson said changes had been introduced last year to allow heads to pay the best teachers more. &quot;We have already changed the rules so that the brightest and best teachers can be rewarded with higher salaries. Our new rules, introduced last September, mean heads can now pay great teachers more. Teachers can finally be paid according to their talents and performance, rather than time served.&quot; On allowing unqualified teachers into academies and free schools, the DfE said: &quot;We trust heads to decide who they hire. It is entirely right that state schools should enjoy the same advantage that private schools have to bring great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists into the classroom.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/06/virginity-for-sale-cambodia-sex-trade", "sentences": ["As well as rich Cambodians, men from countries such as China, Singapore and Thailand are regular buyers, too."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-06T07:00:00Z", "title": "Virginity for sale: inside Cambodia's shocking trade", "tags": ["Global development", "Cambodia", "World news", "Society", "Gender", "Sex trade", "Asia Pacific", "Women", "Slavery"], "article": "Vannith Uy is the owner of what translates from Khmer as a &quot;mobile nail salon&quot;, although the word salon is a stretch. It&apos;s a\u00a0bicycle with\u00a0a\u00a0plastic crate on the back filled with hand lotions and nail polishes. Uy, 42, rides it around her Phnom Penh neighbourhood \u2013 a\u00a0tangle of alleys near the river where the residents&apos; domestic lives spill out of their open\u00a0front doors \u2013 until a customer flags her down. She performs a manicure or pedicure on the spot, sitting on a plastic stool by the side\u00a0of the street. Three years ago, when she arrived from the countryside, Uy had a different plan. She wanted to open a hair and beauty salon on proper premises in the Cambodian capital. &quot;But my family could find only dirty jobs,&quot; she says. &quot;I wanted a place where my daughter and I could work together.&quot; So Uy did something she describes as her &quot;only choice&quot;: she sold her 18-year-old daughter Chamnan&apos;s virginity to a\u00a0wealthy local man for \u00a3900. The man was a police general who frequented the beer garden where Uy worked as a kitchen help, she says. He bought Chamnan for six days and nights. He installed her in a\u00a0hotel room on Phnom Penh&apos;s outskirts and visited her many times to have sex. She was allowed to call her mother once a day. By the third day, Uy recalls, Chamnan was so weak and distressed that the man summoned a doctor on his payroll to give her painkillers and a\u00a0vitamin shot &quot;so she had the strength to keep\u00a0going until the\u00a0end of the week&quot;. Uy received cash payment in full, but her planned salon never materialised. The money that had represented a life-changing sum \u2013 equivalent to around five years&apos; salary in her home village in Kandal province \u2013 soon trickled away. After she&apos;d paid her sick husband&apos;s medical bills, given cash to her ageing parents and bought Chamnan a gold necklace to &quot;raise\u00a0her spirits&quot;, there wasn&apos;t much left. Uy had greatly underestimated the task of clawing her way out of hardship; her stricken expression as she talks suggests she also miscalculated the personal costs of selling her daughter&apos;s body to try. Where to begin unravelling the shadowy, painful layers of Uy and Chamnan&apos;s story? It is not straightforward. Often overlooked by more dramatic tales of enslavement in brothels, the trade in virgins is one of the most endemic forms of sexual exploitation in Cambodia. It is a market sustained by severe poverty and ingrained gender inequality. Its clients are influential Cambodian men and other members of Asia&apos;s elite who enjoy total impunity from a corrupt justice system. Most misunderstood of all, many of those involved in the transactions are not hardcore criminals. They are mothers, fathers, friends and neighbours. Cambodia is far FROM the only place where women and girls are treated as commodities. But in this country of 15 million people, the demand for virgins is big business that thrives due to cultural myth and other local factors. &quot;Many Asian men, especially those over 50, believe sex with virgins gives them magical powers to stay young and ward off illness,&quot; says Chhiv Kek Pung, president of Cambodia&apos;s leading human rights organisation, Licadho. &quot;There&apos;s a steady supply of destitute families for the trade to prey on here, and the rule of law is very weak.&quot; The belief that sex with virgins increases male vigour has long held sway among powerful men in Asia, including Chairman Mao and North Korea&apos;s Kim dynasty. &quot;Unlike sex- tourist paedophiles who seek out children under 10 years old, local men don&apos;t care so much about a virgin&apos;s age \u2013 only her beauty and the fact she&apos;s pure,&quot; says Pung. Parents who sell their daughters&apos; virginity have little concept of child rights. &quot;They regard their offspring as\u00a0their property.&quot; Based on Licadho&apos;s work inside communities, Pung estimates that &quot;many thousands&quot; of virgins aged between 13 and 18 are sold every year. As well as rich Cambodians, men from countries such as China, Singapore and Thailand are regular buyers, too. &quot;They travel here on business and have everything prearranged by brokers: a five-star hotel, a few rounds of golf and a night or two with a virgin,&quot; says Eric Meldrum, a former police detective from the UK who now works as an anti-exploitation consultant in Phnom Penh. The lack of hard figures is partly due to the trade&apos;s secrecy, Meldrum adds. Brokers operate underground, changing tactics and locations often. Plus the fact that close relatives are often involved means it rarely fits into strict definitions of sex trafficking \u2013 when people are tricked or abducted and sold into open-ended slavery \u2013 so it doesn&apos;t show up in those statistics either. But there&apos;s another reason the trade is virtually invisible. Says Licadho&apos;s Pung: &quot;In terms of activism, few organisations highlight virgin buying even though it&apos;s a devastating abuse of young women.&quot; It&apos;s seen as difficult to generate sympathy for the issue among foreign aid donors, she explains, so many NGOs sidestep the issue. (Licadho is one of the exceptions.) &quot;The fear is that, while people might feel sorry for the girls, they&apos;d be too outraged about parents selling their daughters to open their wallets.&quot; That moral complexities are sometimes ignored by those purporting to help was sensationally underscored in late May. Somaly Mam, a self-styled former sex slave and Cambodia&apos;s most famous anti-trafficking campaigner, was forced to resign in disgrace from the US-based foundation that bears her name. The glamorous Mam boasted Hollywood actor Susan Sarandon and Facebook dynamo Sheryl Sandberg among her top supporters. She was feted widely in the media. On the back of heartbreaking stories about herself and Cambodian women under her wing, she raised millions of dollars at glitzy New York galas. Her downfall came after an investigation by a Cambodia Daily reporter revealed that significant parts of the stories she told were untrue. One young woman whom Mam claimed to have rescued from a brothel after a vicious pimp gouged out her right eye had actually lost the eye, it emerged, as the result of a facial tumour. Mam&apos;s own story of woe \u2013 that she was orphaned and sold to a brothel at the age of 12 \u2013 was also dismantled. The awful irony of Mam&apos;s rapid fall is that she didn&apos;t need to lie. Sex trafficking and exploitation exist in Cambodia, just often in less made-for-TV ways than her tragic tales suggested. (Brothels in red-light areas housing enslaved child prostitutes, for example, have been almost wiped out over the past decade.) Dishonesty aside, the greatest pitfall of her fraudulence was not so much that it misrepresented the scale of the problem. It was that it misrepresented the solutions. In promoting herself \u2013 and allowing others to do it for her \u2013 as a survivor single-handedly rescuing girls from evil predators, she made finding answers seem all too easy. &quot;People respond to emotional stories and they hand over their money without understanding underlying causes or long-term solutions,&quot; says S\u00e9bastien Marot, the director of Friends International, an NGO based in Phnom Penh that works with vulnerable children. But in the case of the virgin trade, he says, progress is hard. Pung agrees. &quot;When you talk to people about this, there&apos;s a view that there are plenty of poor people in the world who don&apos;t sell their daughters, so it can&apos;t be blamed on poverty or desperation. But there are many interwoven social factors. You have to look at the whole picture.&quot; At Vannith Uy&apos;s HOME, a dark, wide room that she rents for \u00a310 a week at the back of a grander house, she tells me about her struggle to find work when she first arrived in Phnom Penh. Her husband had a back injury and she had two children, Chamnan and a\u00a0younger son, to support. The capital overflows with rural migrants, all competing for the same menial jobs. &quot;The only work I could find was as a kitchen help in a beer garden. I found Chamnan a job serving ice at the same place.&quot;     Hostesses at a Phnom Penh beer garden. The beer gardens are popular with men looking for virgins. There is no suggestion that these women have been sold  Photograph: Will Baxter    Beer gardens are fairy-lit outdoor pubs where local men go to relax after work. In the evenings all over Phnom Penh, the sound of plaintive Khmer love songs leaks into the darkness, feedback and all, from their giant speakers. The gardens employ miniskirted young women to sell competing brands of Cambodian beer or to work as hostesses and sing karaoke. The d\u00e9cor at one popular place is a disconcerting mix of beer posters and Pooh Bear murals. Uy hated the atmosphere, which she says became more drunken and predatory as the night wore on. &quot;Chamnan is pretty and all the men loved her. They made comments about her body.&quot; While prostitution isn&apos;t openly advertised, many of the hostesses and beer girls supplement their income by selling sex to customers after hours. Brokers also frequent the gardens, touting for men who want to buy virgins or have other &quot;special requests&quot;, which they arrange to take place at discreet locations. Uy says the thought of selling Chamnan&apos;s virginity hadn&apos;t occurred to her until the opportunity arose. &quot;A tall customer in his 50s noticed Chamnan. He came alone and asked her to sit beside him. One evening he asked me if she was a virgin, and said he wanted to buy her.&quot; She found out before the sale took place that he was an off-duty police general. Uy eventually agreed because, in her mind, she saw it as a chance to save Chamnan from becoming drawn into regular sex work. &quot;It was only a matter of time if we stayed at the beer garden. All the girls who worked there seemed to do it eventually.&quot; Economic opportunities are lacking for everyone in Cambodia, where three-quarters of the population lives below or just above the poverty line. But they are especially dire for women, who earn an average of only 27 cents for every dollar earned by a man, according to the Asian Development Bank. Apart from working in the fields, the vast garment industry is the biggest source of female employment. But wages are so pitiful at around \u00a360 per month that workers are currently risking their lives in protests to fight for more. Working in a beer garden or karaoke bar and doing sex work on the side can bring in double that, and some women see it as their best option. But sex work is not only criminalised under the law, leaving those who do it by choice (or lack of it) vulnerable to official abuse, it also brings deep social shame. Expectations of female chastity in Cambodia are enshrined in a code of duty and obedience known as chbab srey, or &quot;women&apos;s law&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s a national saying that men are like gold and women are like cloth,&quot; says Tong Soprach, an academic researcher into the sexual practices of Cambodia&apos;s youth. &quot;If you drop gold in the dirt, it washes clean and still shines. If you drop cloth, the stain never comes out.&quot; This absurd double standard is another reason virginity is so valued, of course. Men typically pay between \u00a3600 and \u00a33,000 to buy a virgin for up to a week, depending on their budget and the girl&apos;s beauty. Uy didn&apos;t know the going rates, but she believed the offer of \u00a3900 for Chamnan would be enough to change their fate. &quot;I explained my idea to Chamnan. She wasn&apos;t happy about going with the man, but she told me she understood.&quot; In fact, chbab srey also dictates that women must obey and help their parents, a rule that is almost universally followed. It would have been difficult for Chamnan to refuse. &quot;When she came home afterwards, I knew she was sad, but we didn&apos;t speak about it. We both felt it was better to forget it ever happened.&quot; Uy took a better-not-to-know approach with her husband, too. To preserve Chamnan&apos;s virtue in his eyes, she told him she had saved up the money from beer garden tips. I asked Uy if I could meet Chamnan, who is now 22, but it wasn&apos;t possible. With the little money left over from her ordeal, she had returned to Kandal province and found a job in a government garment factory making underwear. Does she resent that Uy&apos;s grand plan didn&apos;t materialise? &quot;I don&apos;t think so. She has a steady boyfriend now and hopes to marry him. She has a better life.&quot; But then, as a mother, Uy probably would think that. Cambodian parents love their children as much as anyone, says Nget Thy, director of the Cambodian Center for the Protection of Children&apos;s Rights. But it&apos;s difficult to overstate how many problems exist in some communities. &quot;Any misfortune, from losing a family member to losing a game of cards, can push people below the level they need to eat,&quot; he says. &quot;Attitudes that children exist for their parents&apos; benefit, and that women exist for men&apos;s benefit, are very, very wrong and need addressing urgently. But it&apos;s the men who buy virgins who are the criminals.&quot; At a Phnom Penh riverside slum I meet Dara Keo. Dara&apos;s mother Rotana sold her virginity when she just 12 years old, after her father died leaving gambling debts. The slum&apos;s stilted shacks are home to around 1,000 people, many of whom recycle rubbish as their only source of income. Addiction to drugs, alcohol and gambling is part of daily life. Dara, who is now 18, says almost every teenage girl there is sold for her virginity, usually in deals made with their parents by female neighbours who work as brokers. &quot;Everyone knows it happens but nobody talks about it openly.&quot; Dara&apos;s account, and those of other young women I speak to in the slum, reveal the trade&apos;s dehumanising efficiency. &quot;After my mother sold me for $500 (\u00a3300), the broker took me to a doctor to have my virginity checked and a blood test for HIV,&quot; says Dara. &quot;There were other girls there. We were made to take off our clothes and stand in a line until it was our turn to be examined.&quot; (Buyers insist on proof of virginity to make sure they are not being tricked.) Then she was taken to meet her buyer in an exclusive hotel room. The man, who was wearing &quot;a dark suit and a gold watch&quot;, didn&apos;t speak or look at her at all, Dara says. &quot;He pinned me down on the bed, unzipped his trousers and forced himself into me. The pain was very great.&quot; Over the next seven days, he came to the hotel to have sex with her two or three times a day. He didn&apos;t use a condom. &quot;A\u00a0few times he asked if he was hurting me. When I told him yes, he used even more force.&quot; I ask about the man&apos;s identity. Dara gives me the name of a Cambodian politician who is still in office. It is impossible for her to reveal his name publicly. By the time she was allowed to return home her vagina was torn and bruised. Her mother took her to a local doctor, who gave her painkillers and told her that her injuries would &quot;heal on their own&quot;. A senior police officer who agrees to speak anonymously says prominent men like politicians do not fear being caught because they know the police won&apos;t act. &quot;If you try to enforce the law with these men, you will have a big problem,&quot; the officer says, dressed in civilian clothes in a Phnom Penh coffee shop. &quot;I have been threatened, and some of my colleagues working on this issue have had their jobs threatened.&quot; He relates how he has been warned by &quot;people high up&quot; not to pursue cases of virgin buying (and also rape) because &quot;having sex is human nature&quot; and such issues were &quot;not serious&quot;. He mentions a case last year of a senior military officer who was diagnosed with cancer and given one year to live. His wife agreed to let the man use more than \u00a31m of their family money to &quot;enjoy himself&quot; before he died. &quot;We knew he was buying a new virgin every week, but there was nothing we could do,&quot; says the policeman. (The man died recently.) Men in power or big business &quot;who have a good relationship with each other&quot; are the only people who can afford to buy virgins, he adds, so arresting perpetrators is blocked by corruption at the very top. Although all forms of buying and selling sex are illegal in Cambodia, not one Khmer man has ever been convicted of purchasing virgins. During her year working at the beer garden, Uy saw firsthand how the country&apos;s male elite bought virgins with entitled ease. She saw more than 50 young women being purchased, &quot;like they were delicious food&quot;. As well as the police general who bought Chamnan, she came to know some of the other buyers well. One was an ageing politician from the ruling Cambodian People&apos;s Party (CPP). &quot;Everybody loved him because he gave big tips.&quot; She mentions the politician&apos;s name. He is someone whose name crops up repeatedly in relation to the virgin trade among journalists and activists in Cambodia. (It is not the same politician who bought Dara.) Uy said the man went further than purchasing virgins for his immediate pleasure \u2013 he &quot;reserved&quot; younger girls for the future. &quot;He asked mothers to bring their underage daughters to the beer garden after-hours,&quot; she explains. &quot;Then he chose the ones he liked, and gave their mothers some money every week to buy rice until the girls grew up.&quot; A mutual arrangement was made, she adds, that he would buy their virginity when they reached adolescence.     A slum area in Phnom Penh. Severe poverty and ingrained gender inequality fuel Cambodia's virgin trade Photograph: Heng Sinith/AP    I spoke to Mu Sochua, a former Minister of Women&apos;s Affairs and now a\u00a0leading light in the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). She has campaigned for years on the need to address corruption and poverty, and advance women&apos;s status. In recent months she has been braving the front line of garment workers&apos; protests to support their demand for a livable wage. While &quot;the rule of law is not on the agenda of the current government&quot;, she says bluntly, addressing sexual exploitation such as the virgin trade needs to be part of efforts to tackle gender inequality on all fronts. &quot;We have to increase education about women&apos;s rights to change attitudes,&quot; she says. &quot;We need to win public support for an effective rule of law that punishes those who buy sex, not those who sell it.&quot; The old men of the CPP have been in power continuously for 30 years. Mu Sochua, along with many others, believes the most recent general election last year was\u00a0rigged. &quot;The Cambodian people have already voted for change, so that is hopeful,&quot; she says. When the regime finally dies, she hopes that iniquities such as the virgin trade will die with it. But will it? Take the politician who gave big tips that Uy mentioned. It&apos;s such an open secret in Phnom Penh that he is a prolific buyer of virgins that a Cambodian journalist who knows him well offered to introduce me to him. He was sure the politician would talk if I agreed to quote him anonymously. The journalist quickly decided not to get involved. Even so, the moment suggested the lack of shame surrounding the practice and how much men like the politician must take their impunity for granted.

The wall of Barry Huggett&apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling with neat rows of files \u2013 one for each of his 460 children. They&apos;re packed with letters from staff detailing students&apos; needs: reports from occupational therapists, educational psychologists and speech and language therapists, to name a few. The school, which Huggett has led for some 20 years, only admits students with language-based problems such as dyslexia though, as he points out, teachers rarely refer to a child&apos;s label. &quot;We&apos;re interested in what their needs are, and it&apos;s likely that those needs will change significantly with time,&quot; he says, adding that many are actually comorbid, meaning that they have aspects of more than one learning difficulty. &quot;You&apos;re not stuck with one thing forever. If you label children there&apos;s a danger that you teach to the label: &apos;He&apos;s one of those, so I&apos;ll teach him this way.&apos;&quot; At More House, teachers focus on finding students&apos; strengths as well as supporting their weaknesses. This means paying close attention to pupil progress, and providing a diverse curriculum \u2013 the sixth-form offers around 20 different qualifications to a year group of just 60 students. Huggett, who has been awarded an OBE for his services to education, joined the teaching profession after a brief spate in pharmaceutical and actuarial businesses. On his first day working in life insurance he realised that office life wasn&apos;t for him. &quot;I&apos;d dash out into St James&apos; park every lunchtime and say &apos;I&apos;m free, I&apos;m free,&apos;&quot; he laughs. Teaching offered a much more fulfilling career choice, and after working in state primaries and prep schools he took his first headship at More House. &quot;I came here very naive and not really knowing very much about special needs at all. It wasn&apos;t the opportunity to make a difference that appealed to me,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The main thing was that it looked like a challenge.&quot; The quality of education available to students with learning difficulties has developed a great deal since Huggett joined the school in the 1990s, when \u2013 as he puts it diplomatically \u2013 provision across the country &quot;probably wasn&apos;t desperately good.&quot; But there are still children who fall through the cracks. A lot of students join More House because they haven&apos;t had a positive experience of schooling elsewhere. &quot;It might be that the child is not progressing as they should and is maybe being turned off school,&quot; he says, adding that some students have been school phobic when starting More House. &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean that we are better than the schools that they&apos;ve come from, it just means that we&apos;re able to offer things in a different way.&quot; As an independent school, More House has the ability to deliver a curriculum in a way that suits its children&apos;s needs \u2013 a freedom now also granted to academies and free schools. The range of qualifications on offer helps it secure above average results: between 70 to 75% of students get five A* to C passes at GCSE. School leavers&apos; employment records are equally impressive \u2013 after studying the outcomes of a group of 200 former students aged 22 to 35, More House found that only two were out of work. Schools shouldn&apos;t be discouraged from offering vocational options, according to Huggett, who fears that such subjects are being downgraded. &quot;Fine yes, we want our education system to be as good as Singapore&apos;s, but the country doesn&apos;t just need people who can do history, geography, a language and a bit of maths and science. Some students would be better off learning how to weld or make things out of wood \u2013 society needs these people too.&quot; Getting a place at More House isn&apos;t easy. Almost half of parents manage to secure local authority (LA) funding, while the rest have to pay the school fees themselves. It&apos;s also oversubscribed and only takes a very specific group of learners. Those hoping to enter have to sit an admissions assessment to test whether or not they will benefit from the type of teaching on offer. Too often, explains Huggett, special education needs (SEN) students are incorrectly assessed or clumsily put alongside children who have very different needs. &quot;I&apos;ve known children who&apos;ve been labelled as something that they&apos;re not, simply to fit the criteria of the school.&quot; The acute shortage of specialist schools does not help the situation. &quot;There is a huge need for places in schools like this,&quot; he explains. &quot;There aren&apos;t many schools like More House around \u2013 we&apos;re the largest, but we&apos;re small.&quot; Years have passed since the Bercow report highlighted the paucity of provision for children with language-based learning difficulties, but little has changed. Although the green paper on special educational needs and disability offered hope, the lack of funding available to local authorities means reforms are unlikely to live up to expectations, says Huggett. He feels that an opportunity has been lost: &quot;It seems that the whole thing has been downgraded. It will be delivered by local authorities who do not have the funding. It doesn&apos;t feel like authorities know how it&apos;s going to work. There&apos;s a lot of misinformation out there.&quot; And while the introduction of education, health and care plans (EHCP) will benefit children with more severe disabilities, it is unlikely that they will help the type of young people who attend his school. He suspects that in future years, fewer of his students will be LA-funded. &quot;There&apos;s less money to go around, and \u2013 for the children we deal with \u2013 I think parents will find it harder to get an EHCP for their child. I&apos;m intrigued to see how it will turn out.&quot; In the meantime Huggett is taking his own steps to tackle the shortage of special school places. He has ambitions to open a school similar to More House in the north of England, where there are very few opportunities for students with language-based learning difficulties. Huggett hopes that by helping to open an SEN school in Dubai in September 2015, he will raise enough money to fund the project. And, given the lack of specialist provision in the English-speaking world more broadly, he thinks there may be opportunities for expansion elsewhere. &quot;We&apos;re having nothing to do with the Dubai school financially, an investor is taking care of that side of it. But we will, by helping to run the school, get a fairly reasonable fee which we&apos;re using to set up another school here. &quot;Up beyond Leeds, or even below Leeds, there is very little provision of this sort. It&apos;s all about inclusion \u2013 but inclusion doesn&apos;t work for all children.&quot; The school leadership and management hub is funded by Zurich.

The nation became more independent of Britain after the second world war when, together with the US, it blocked invasion from Japan. Yet Australian higher education continues to look remarkably like that of the UK. There is just one difference, but in the long run it will be very important. In the last generation both the UK and Australia have doubled the proportion of the population entering higher education. Both have moved from near free tuition to high tuition, funded by loans repaid through taxation on an income-contingent basis. Each treasury worries about the mounting long-term cost of loan non-repayment and subsidised interest rates. Australia deregulated student numbers in 2012, and in 2015 the UK will follow, offering higher education places to all students qualified to enter. Each country provides a unitary system of universities with a common mission in teaching, research and service, competing fiercely for students and research support. In each country the combined outcome of historical inequalities and market forces is a steep hierarchy of higher education institutions (HEIs), informal but real. The most research-intensive universities are on top (the Russell Group in the UK, Group of Eight in Australia), with successive universities positioned below them at decreasing levels of research and prestige. In both countries further and vocational education sits below the universities, underfunded and lacking the prestige of second sectors in countries such as Germany. On the margins of higher education both UK and Australia subsidise private colleges through student loans, and the number of students in for-profit HEIs is growing. In both UK and Australia higher education has been reshaped by business models and a new emphasis on students as customers. Organisational cultures are like peas in a pod. Both systems run periodic research assessment exercises, like modern Domesday books, that have stepped up competition and internal mobility. There is also much movement of professors and executive leaders between the two countries. In a world in which cross-border student numbers are growing at twice the rate of domestic student populations, both the UK and Australia generate major export income as providers of English-language education, charging Asian and African students fees well above those paid by local students. In 2012-13 there were 425,265 foreign students (including EU students) in UK higher education and 230,923 in Australia. Both are multicultural with a traditional Anglo core, comfortable with foreign students but struggling with the politics of migration, creating tension with the education export industry. Tensions are greater in the UK, where the UK Independence party (Ukip) is riding high, but Australia has its share of white-is-right activists and shock-jock radio spruikers. The one difference between higher education in the UK and Australia is the geopolitics. The UK is at the edge of the EU and deciding whether it is European or not. Australia has an indigenous population under-represented in higher education. It is also at the edge of south-east Asia, and figuring out if it is British, continental \u2013 there are large heritage communities from Italy, Greece, the Balkans and Turkey \u2013 or Asian. Economically, demographically and culturally, the Asian element is growing fast. More than half of Australia&apos;s export trade, led by coal, iron ore, gold and education, is with China, Japan, Korea and other dynamic regional economies. Australia largely avoided the post-2008 recession because of its burgeoning trade with China. There has been little increase in unemployment. The largest source countries for migrants into Australia were once UK and Ireland. Now they are China and India. Malaysia and Indonesia are also important. Many Asian migrants start out as international students. More by luck than design the regional geopolitics are playing in Australia&apos;s favour. North-east Asia is now the most dynamic region in world higher education. Korea and Taiwan have near universal levels of tertiary participation. China&apos;s output of scientific papers is expanding by 16.5% a year. North-east Asia now spends more on research and development than the US and Canada combined, and 40% more than the UK/Europe. When China opened up to the world, Australia developed the relationship early. While UK researchers have primarily focused on collaboration with Europe, a major source of research funding, Australian universities have been building ties in Asia. Australia has higher rates of research collaboration in China, Taiwan and Singapore (though it is weaker in Korea) than the US. Among all the English-speaking nations, the UK has the lowest rates of research collaboration in dynamic Asia.

The fast food chain is not known for its commitment to equal rights more broadly. In 2009 it introduced an advertisement in Singapore that showed a picture of a woman looking like a blow-up doll, her mouth wide open and a &quot;super seven incher&quot; aimed at it, with the caption, &quot;It&apos;ll blow your mind away&quot;. The gay community used to be defined by politics, but lesbians and gay men no longer share a political base \u2013 only, in some quarters, a social one. Rather than meeting on the picket line, we meet on a commercialised social scene, in clubs often owned by straight entrepreneurs, or at the annual gay and lesbian wedding show. This deradicalised version of gay life revolves around marriage, babies and mortgages. Many gays have kidded themselves that bigger and richer sponsors for our Pride events and charities means acceptance rather than acquiescence; that it is a sign we are reaching full equality. But how can we be liberated when there are still daily attacks on gay people, and when the school playground remains, in many ways, hostile to gay pupils? Just last week a YouGov poll, commissioned by Stonewall, found that 86% of secondary school teachers had witnessed homophobic bullying. Almost every aspect of gay life has been commercialised \u2013 we can buy sperm, gay-themed wedding services, and holidays \u2013 and whenever there is a gay festival or event, the banks, airlines, restaurant chains and other large companies are usually there to profit, all in the name of supporting our quest for equality. It is hardly surprising that we sometimes appreciate being targeted by big business. Gay men, in particular, tend to have more disposable income than their heterosexual counterparts, and while there has been a baby boom in the gay community as a whole, the majority of lesbians still don&apos;t have children, so potentially have more money to spend on luxury items such as exotic holidays and expensive clothing. Charities that campaign on our behalf are increasingly getting into bed with big business. Last year, during its push to tackle homophobia in football, Stonewall collaborated with Paddy Power to distribute rainbow-coloured boot laces to every professional player in the UK. But like Burger King, Paddy Power has attracted controversy in its attitudes to women, with an advert showing a statuette with the face of Oscar Pistorius, next to the words: &quot;It&apos;s Oscar Time. Money back if he walks. We will refund all losing bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial if he is found not guilty.&quot; Even pregnancy and childbirth have become commercialised. In recent years a huge amount of money has been spent by lesbians and gay men on embryos, sperm, IVF and surrogacy services. Now that we are indivisible from straight people \u2013 at least those who marry and have children \u2013 banks are targeting us to help increase their profits. Last year, a cosy lesbian couple featured in one of NatWest&apos;s adverts, showing just how important our spending potential is. Some will hail all this as a great stride forward, an indication that we are now so mainstream that even banks represent us respectfully. But this is about equity, not equality. Lesbians and gay men have accepted a fake, highly limited liberation which involves spending and sponsorship, and embraces the notion of inviting church and state back into our relationships (preferably monogamous, with mortgages and babies). In the radical days of the Gay Liberation Front, both lesbians and gay men wanted to abolish marriage, not be invited to join this oppressive, patriarchal regime. As Jill Tweedie wrote in this newspaper in 1971, Gay Lib does not plead for the right of homosexuals to marry, &quot;Gay Lib questions marriage&quot;. When I came out in 1977, the GLF had fizzled out, but the gay men and lesbians I met celebrated the counter-culture over the status quo. Many of us lived collectively, raising children as a community or friendship group, rather than in traditional couples. We critiqued monogamy and the privileging of the nuclear family. We have now swapped laughing at marriage for lauding it. What happened to that early radicalism? It would seem that after the horrendous bigotry which accompanied the Aids pandemic and led to Section 28 in the 1980s, we became so weary we simply wanted to blend in to the mainstream. What would real gay liberation look like? Marriage would be abolished for all in favour of something based on equality and next of kin rights rather than ownership and tax avoidance. Gay men and lesbians alike would challenge a culture and politics based on consumerism, and would speak out against the misogyny that confines both groups to stereotypes. And we would look beyond the picket fence and rejoin the picket lines in protest about the ongoing oppression and anti-gay bigotry we still face, despite legislative equality. We have been sold a dream of marriage, babies, and conventionality at a huge cost to our radical potential, and the profits will not go to our freedom and liberation. While lesbians and gay men fork out on marriage, an institution previously eschewed by feminists and anti-capitalists, our brothers and sisters in Russia, India, Uganda and elsewhere are suffering the most grotesque oppression by the state, and here in the UK lesbians and gay men continue to be queer-bashed, bullied and denied respect and dignity, despite huge gains in the past decades. In the face of all this, gay liberation needs a new start. It is time we put campaigning before capital. \u2022 Join Julie Bindel, Stella Duffy, Patrick Strudwick and Qazi Rahman in conversation with Kira Cochrane on Thursday 17 July as they discuss whether there is a gay gene, and whether it should matter if there is.

Almost a quarter of a century on and these principles still resonate, still matter. For most people, a post-school education provides a better, longer life and a better shot at employment. It gives you greater power to make decisions about your life. Today in Australia, like the UK, the debate around access to, and cost of, higher education is back in the national spotlight. Who should have access and who should pay \u2013 is higher education a public good or a private benefit? The first budget from prime minister Tony Abbott&apos;s new government outlined sweeping changes to the university sector. Some argue this is long overdue, others are mortified. I have long argued that a world-class and equitable higher education system requires strong and consistent policy and long-term government investment. The global academy has been watching the unintended consequences of the erosion in government investment in England and Wales. A particular fascination has been the very significant escalation in fees associated with a repayment system that has a capacity to wipe out debt after a period. None of it has been pretty, but the resulting brain drain to Australia has been beneficial and helpful. But we must heed the warnings or we will follow down that same murky path. Unlike the UK, Australia does not have a cap on tuition fees. We have taken the private benefit of education one step further. The changes now proposed in Australia include allowing universities to charge students whatever fees they like for courses. This is likely to create a university class structure, similar to the US, and attracting many new, private providers to Australia. The new market will limit choice This new market is expected to alter behaviour and perhaps limit choice as price is a more significant consideration. The US Nobel laureate and world-leading economist professor Joseph Stiglitz is outspoken on the trend in the US that has the poor mostly locked into low-quality, high-debt, poor employment education cycles. All of this has been brought about by the Australian government&apos;s decision to cut its contribution to the cost of undergraduate student education by around 20%, the thinking being that the private benefit of education for many justifies lower public investment. These are big cuts. Fees will have to go up to ensure we maintain our standards of education, keep our ability to attract the very best staff and ensure we live up to our community engagement obligations. A risk of job losses What we now have in common with our English colleagues is a risk of significant job losses and downward pressure on salaries. Worse still, people who may have chosen academia as a career will either direct their talents to something else or leave the country. The evidence from institutions in England and Wales is compelling: they are already cutting programmes and teaching budgets in order to protect research funds. In Australia, the reduction in Research Training Scheme funding is an unexpected and surprising change and a potential blow to the nation&apos;s innovation system. Not least, the signal is sent that we do not value the growth and nurturing of our next generation of innovators and researchers. Competition with other providers is not the issue. Generally Australian universities are good at competing as our prominence on the international stage and all the ranking tables will attest. The big and very disappointing signal is that public investment in research and education in Australia is no longer valued as a competitive advantage. All of those around us in our region \u2013 China, Singapore, Korea \u2013 and in the OECD are increasing investment while we look on with despair as we decline. More debt for the poor There are also plans in the budget to index student debt payments (which are repaid once employment begins) at the 10-year government bond rate instead of the more benign Consumer Price Index. This is both punitive and unfair, as compound interest will have many unintended consequences: the poor will acquire more debt, while others will be indifferent to course fees as they simply defer payment, never work, or leave Australia, with many only realising the error of the decisions when it is too late to do anything about it. Like the UK, we face the prospect of debts that are never repaid. Unlike the UK, there is no proposal in Australia to have a moratorium on old debt. None of the proposed changes are through the Australian Senate yet and we hope the extraordinarily aggressive changes to funding cuts and the interest rate on student loans in particular will not make it to the other side intact. Surely there is room for a more moderate approach and for a better signal to our nation about education, both its public good and private benefit? Surely Australia can learn from the UK and the US experiences? We all know that, in the new knowledge economy, change is essential \u2013 for all nations. If Australia is to prosper and be a force for innovation, for public good and for the values and activities that are in our national interest, then we must embrace the transformations wrought by digital disruption that shows no mercy on any nation or individual. It is a disappointment that changes to higher education appear to be coming at a high cost to the public good in both of our nations. Whatever the future holds, we must remain true to our promise of educating the next generation, our most precious asset. Those future students deserve that privilege, and our countries deserve a smart and well-educated population if we are to continue to prosper and achieve on the world stage.

One studies one\u2019s adversary. I have met him on the ground half a dozen times \u2026 if that isn\u2019t opportunity enough for any fool to size up his man, may the devil take me if I can tell what is.\u201d  Joseph Conrad, The Duel  The ball was delivered from around the wicket. By the time it began to drop down from its loop, the batsman knew enough about its flight to feel he should press forward to meet it. He raised his bat back behind him, flicked his right foot out and across, then followed it with his left. In fencing they call it a balestra, a short jump forward in preparation for an attack. It left him vulnerable, with the stumps showing behind him. The bowler instinctively threw his arms up in anticipation of the chance that his experience told him would soon follow. The ball landed, on a length just wide of off, and turned back towards those exposed stumps, exactly as the bowler knew it would. It didn\u2019t get there. The bat fell. And the ball flew. The bowler turned to see it pass the man at extra cover, then swivelled on his heel and started back for his mark as it ran on towards the boundary for four. This was one of a sequence of six deliveries spread across four overs at Lord\u2019s last Saturday, in the match between the MCC and the Rest of the World. They were the final cuts, thrusts, parries, and ripostes in a series of duels that have spanned 21 years, which started in Colombo back in 1993, before the youngest of men playing alongside the two protagonists had even made it to high school. It is possible that no two players in the history of international cricket have faced each other as often as Muttiah Muralitharan and Sachin Tendulkar, but it is impossible to be sure. Ball-by-ball data for matches that took place before the last decade is hard to come by. Travis Basevi, 9th Dan statistician, the mind behind Cricinfo\u2019s Statsguru, believes that Ian Botham and Allan Border may beat them. Botham bowled a record 9,122 balls in matches involving Border, and, as Travis says, \u201cyou can only assume Border faced a fair proportion of them\u201d, given that he scored 3,267 runs in those matches. Murali bowled 8,318 balls in matches involving Tendulkar, and Tendulkar scored 3,095 in those same games. Botham v Border is another story. And certainly they played fewer matches against each other than Murali and Tendulkar did. There were 66 in all, at grounds across the world, from Colombo and Kandy to Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, through Dhaka, Singapore, Sharjah, Taunton, Johannesburg, Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, and Port of Spain. Theirs is a rivalry that has played out in 32 stadiums across nine countries and five continents, in almost every conceivable set of circumstances and conditions which cricket can provide. Just like the two men in Conrad\u2019s story, who fought in gardens, plains, and woods, on foot and horseback, with swords and pistols. Conrad based it on the true tale of two officers in the French army, Dupont and Fournier, who, having fallen out and failed to find satisfaction, agreed that whenever they knowingly came within 100 miles of each other they would meet midway to renew their fight, until one of them confessed himself beaten. It was 19 years, and a dozen duels, until one of them, Fournier, finally did. By then they were friends, having met, fought, even dined together, so often, they became \u201ctwo indomitable companions in activity and endurance\u201d. Murali and Tendulkar are unusual in that they fought on almost equal terms. In cricket we tend to pair opposing bowlers and their bunnies, be it Atherton and McGrath, or Warne and Cullinan, or, occasionally, batsmen with bowlers they bested. Murali\u2019s rivalry with Brian Lara is better remembered than his one with Tendulkar, because of the way Lara mastered his bowling during West Indies\u2019 tour to Sri Lanka in 2001. Murali and Tendulkar both achieved against each other. Murali dismissed him 13 times, more than any other bowler but Brett Lee. But Tendulkar averaged 46 in those matches. Tendulkar\u2019s team won 27 of the 66 encounters, Murali\u2019s 26. The odd one between them was the last, perhaps the most important, the 2011 World Cup Final in Mumbai. They played six World Cup matches against each other in all, and Murali never once took Tendulkar\u2019s wicket in the tournament, but then Tendulkar never scored a match-winning century against him. At first, Murali confessed, he was in awe of Tendulkar. They first played so long ago, in fact, that he himself forgot the details of the encounter, and insisted it was in an ODI, when it was actually a Test. Murali was a year older, but many matches less experienced. Tendulkar had played 28 Tests by that point, and made his name with famous innings like the 148 at Sydney, and the 114 at Perth. Murali himself had only played six Tests, and his place in the side was uncertain. \u201cHe had already become a legend\u201d, Murali remembered. \u201cI had hardly watched Sachin on the television as in those days, we rarely saw live TV broadcasts in Sri Lanka. But as soon as I saw him first hand, I realised he was special. He played with such authority and command that it was unnerving,\u201d Murali said. When this \u201ccurly-haired kid\u201d stepped on to the ground, \u201ceveryone was speaking about his talent, but I was wondering if this young bloke was really good enough to challenge us.\u201d He soon decided Tendulkar was \u201cmuch greater than what people think\u201d. It took Murali four years, and 16 matches, just to take Tendulkar\u2019s wicket. It first happened in an ODI in Colombo in 1997. And, once beaten, he fell to him again four more times in the next 12 months. By then Tendulkar was labouring under the weight of the captaincy, and Murali, having come through the ordeal of being called for throwing in Australia, was beginning to establish himself as one of the most potent spinners in the history of the game. The fortunes of the two men changed over time, along with their temperaments. \u201cSachin in the first half of his career was a very aggressive and intimidating batsman,\u201d Murali has said. \u201cHe took control of a bowling attack and did not allow you to settle into any rhythm. Bad balls were punished mercilessly and even good balls were often plundered for boundaries. He was willing to take risks and he was a wonderful sight in full flow.\u201d In those days, he found Tendulkar as hard to bowl to as any batsman he had met. But \u201cas the years ticked on, though, the expectations from him mushroomed so much that he had to change his game. As he matured as a person and batsman, he was less inclined to take risks and was less aggressive. For me as a bowler, I then started to find it easier to bowl at him, although he obviously remained a brilliant batsman.\u201d After Sachin\u2019s century against Murali in Sharjah in 2000, his eighth against him in the space of 31 innings across six years, there were just two more hundreds to come, and only one worth remembering. That was his 109 at Delhi\u2019s Feroz Shah Kotla, which finally took Tendulkar past Sunil Gavaskar\u2019s world-record tally of 34 Test centuries. He was 100 not out overnight. The next morning Murali finally got his man in the thick of a spell that took five for 23 as India collapsed to 290. By the close Murali had bowled 39 of 97 overs. In those days his doosra was a wicked creature, too good, in that match, for all three of VVS Laxman, Sourav Ganguly and MS Dhoni. Murali, too, became a little less aggressive with age. Tendulkar was there for Murali\u2019s last Test. He fell to him, for the final time, in the first innings. That made him the first victim of Murali\u2019s 67th, and final, five-wicket haul in Test cricket. After that India were stalling for time, as they had been made to follow-on and rain had washed out the second day. Tendulkar did his damndest. He faced 142 balls, almost half of them from Murali, but got out to Lasith Malinga. And the opening allowed Murali to take three more wickets, the last of them, of course, his 800th in Test cricket. By then the two were, if not firm friends, then, at least, the most respectful and familiar of old foes. \u201cHe has inspired me with his passion and dedication towards the game,\u201d Murali said. \u201cHis contribution will always be remembered. He played like a true gentleman. He conducted himself in a dignified manner\u2026 a gentleman of the game. He always came across as a humble and quiet person. He was just outstanding.\u201d The ball was delivered from around the wicket, a little wider than the last. The line was similar, but it did not fly so high. It had a flatter trajectory. It looked likely to land too full, too wide, to threaten the stumps. The batsman dropped into a crouch, bending his right leg so the pad was flat down against the ground, and cocked his bat half-back. He set himself to steer it wide of the slips. It was an audacious shot, and he realised as he played it, the wrong one. He tried to sway his hips away to give himself little more room to work in. Too late. The ball caught the edge and ricocheted into the wicket. The batsman did not stop. As soon as he had regained his footing he turned and walked away, back to the pavilion. The bowler did not celebrate. He knew that the applause was not in celebration of his victory but was, instead, a mark of respect for the defeated. But a sly, satisfied, grin spread across his face. Tendulkar, 44 off 45 balls, bowled Muralitharan, one last time. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

The incumbent, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is the fourth president since the fall of the former authoritarian ruler Suharto in 1998 \u2013 and the first to have been directly elected. After serving a maximum two five-year terms in office Yudhoyono is ineligible to seek a third term. This is the first time power will be handed from one directly elected president to another.

Crippled by the Asian financial crisis of 1998, today it is south-east Asia&apos;s largest economy, a member of G20 and one of the best performing economies globally. Counted among the Mints (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey), a new group of emerging market economies, Indonesia&apos;s economy is projected to be the seventh largest globally by 2030. Over recent years, the country has returned to investment grade, and sustained strong growth throughout the global recession, largely on the back of healthy domestic consumption. Its GDP growth is forecast to be 5.7% this year and picking up further in 2015. However, around 32 million Indonesians still live below the poverty line and the country&apos;s economic potential is held by back by high levels of corruption and infrastructure bottlenecks.

Dynamic society As a military coup undermines the political stability of Thailand, and questions persist about quasi one-party-rule in Malaysia and Singapore, Indonesia&apos;s democratic transition has largely been hailed as successful. Since the fall of Suharto, and the end of his nepotistic 31 years in power, Indonesia has moved from centralised rule to a boisterous democracy. Vote buying and &quot;money politics&quot; have marred past votes, but the country&apos;s elections are largely free and fair and the country boasts a dynamic civil society and one of the most vibrant and critical press corps in Asia. In a parliament that is dominated by individuals who rose to prominence during the Suharto era, corruption remains a huge problem. But the country&apos;s anti-corruption body, the KPK, has made incredible gains. The &quot;graftbusters&quot; have jailed some high-profile politicians and figures in recent years, just this week putting Akil Mochtar, the former head of the constitutional court, behind bars for life.     There are around 216 million Muslims in Indonesia, more than in the whole of the Arab world. (AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim) Photograph: Achmad Ibrahim/AP    4. Moderate Islam With a population of 240 million people, 90% of whom are Muslim, is often held up, alongside Turkey, as an example of the compatibility of democracy and Islam. Though the Middle East may be the centre of gravity for the Islamic world, Indonesia has more Muslims than that entire region. Since the fall of Suharto, when both political and religious freedoms were curtailed, democracy and Islam have thrived. Muslims in Indonesia predominately practise a moderate form of Islam, and during recent years the government has worked hard to cripple extremist groups, such as those behind the 2002 Bali bombings. Indonesia&apos;s constitution protects religious freedom but under Yudhoyono \u2013 whose coalition includes Islamic-based parties \u2013 religious intolerance against Christians, Shia Muslims and Ahmadis has been on the rise.     The Indonesia archipelago includes more than 17,000 islands. Guardian Graphics    5. National unity Poised to play a greater role on the global stage, politically and economically, Indonesia needs a leader who can unify one of the world&apos;s most diverse nations. This is a country that stretches across more than 17,000 islands, with hundreds of ethnic groups and languages \u2013 and yet has held together well since its foundation in 1945. In a globalised world beset by schism, separatism and break-up, it stands as an example of the benefits of togetherness. Both leading candidates have a nationalist thread to their argument.

And participants tended to value processed information more highly as well because of their perception that it gave a greater insight into their lifestyle. But interestingly personal information becomes even more highly valued in certain circumstances. For example, the study covered two unusual days. The first was a holiday in Italy known as the Immaculate Conception holiday. The second was a day of particularly high winds which caused multiple roadblocks and accidents. &quot;The median bids for all categories in these two days were significantly higher than for the rest of the days in the study,&quot; say Staiano and co. In other words, participants value their information more highly on days that are unusual compared to typical days.  \u20ac2 per day is over \u20ac700 annually. You can read the Arxiv paper.

Unbundling mobile apps for the emerging markets &gt;&gt; Lightspeed  I think unbundling is a strategy that has not yet been applied with vigor in the emerging markets on smartphones. I think there are potentially disproportionate advantages to be had by unbundling in countries like India, in the short- to medium-term. Why is this? Because low device memory limits (typically less than 16 Gb), low bandwidth limits (mostly 2G) and relatively high bandwidth prices result in dramatic drops in conversion rates, download success rates and retention rates as app size increases. Also, in my opinion, discovery on the app stores is easier when there is a single focused value prop (kind of the approach that Whatsapp has taken with a singular focus on messaging).  The graph of downloads against file size is persuasive. Tablet PC quarterly shipments fall for the first time, according to NPD DisplaySearch &gt;&gt; DisplaySearch  &quot;Tablet PC demand in 2014 is being affected by falling demand for the 7&quot; class in emerging regions and in China, where many local white-box brands have experienced lower-than-expected shipment growth,&quot; said Hisakazu Torii, vice president, smart application research at NPD DisplaySearch. &quot;Most major brands have recently reduced their business plans for 2014. There is a risk that the replacement cycle for tablet PCs will lengthen beyond the one to two year range unless brands can develop more attractive usage scenarios.&quot;  Forecasts declining notebook sales. The truth behind Apple&apos;s suppliers in China (Part 1) &gt;&gt; SonnyDickson  In Hua Qiang North Market, the heart of asia&apos;s electronics market, there is a building called YuanWang Digital Mall. There are dozens of iPhone 5 &amp; 6, iPads, and Macs such as Mac Mini&apos;s and Macbook&apos;s. These units vary from real, and fake units. All the real units and all their accessories are\u00a0 being showcased and traded throughout that mall, and later sold and distributed around the whole world. Almost all the goods there are smuggled goods from HK, due to 17% tax at China customs, so smuggling to avoid high tax is very very profitable. On May 27th, Shen Zhen Customs (Shenzhen anti-smuggling governing body), and Hua Qiang street authorities,\u00a0stormed the YuanWang Mall to try to catch some of those smugglers and whoever was said to sell Apple/Samsung/Nokia/etc units, or fake Apple/Samsung/Nokia units. More than 120 government officials are involved in this operation. Apple may have had a role in this raid, since Apple have the ability to track all serials &amp; activations between HK and China. There are 3 major smugglers and sellers who own 10 warehouses, 38 shops inside the mall, and around the area have been caught. During these operations more than 2 thousand people witnessed the whole raid, making it such a scene in the area.  A Statistical Comparison of the iOS and Android Stores &gt;&gt; ShinobiControls Website Colin Eberhardt:   A few months ago I published a blog post which showed the results of analysing the meta-data of 75,000 apps from the iTunes App Store. This analysis revealed some interesting results; 75% of apps are free, 60% have no ratings and the Entertainment category has the worst user ratings. This blog post continues the analysis by adding 60,000 Android apps into the mix. For those of you that like their information presented in tweet-sized portions, here are some quick results \u2022 The iOS store has 3.5x more business apps than the Android store, and 2x more Education apps.\u2022 Both stores have roughly the same number of free apps, at 75%\u2022 The most expensive category in the Android store is Medicine at $21 avg, which is double the most expensive iOS category, Business, with an average price of $12.\u2022 The average user rating of Android apps is slightly lower than iOS apps\u2022 The Apple store has 3x more apps with zero user ratings.  Would have been nice - with the Android apps (as it&apos;s not available for the iOS store) - would have been an analysis of the number of downloads. (Thanks @HotSoup for the link.) German court orders Motorola to stop selling top phones &gt;&gt; Cult of Android  A German court has ordered Motorola to stop selling selected smartphones in Germany to do a dispute over the design of their antennas.

Stop the JerkTech &gt;&gt; TechCrunch Josh Constine:   &quot;Go disr*pt yourself&quot; is what I have to say to founders of startups like ReservationHop and Parking Monkey. They&apos;re emblematic of a compassionless new wave of self-serving startups that exploit small businesses and public infrastructure to make a buck and aid the wealthy. Let&apos;s call these parasites #JerkTech. It&apos;s one thing to outcompete a big, stagnant company with new technology. It&apos;s another to screw over the little guys just because you can sell what&apos;s usually free. So what do these tools do? ReservationHop places phony reservations at the hottest San Francisco restaurants, and then sells them for $5 or $10 apiece on its site. That makes it harder for the common man to get a reservation, since if they call the restaurant directly, they&apos;ll find all the spots taken. And if ReservationHop doesn&apos;t sell the spots it stole? Tough luck for the restaurant, which just had a table go empty or wasted a half hour because the fake Dick Jerkson that ReservationHop put as the name on the res never showed up.

Unlikely that money is being spent, but very likely that users are highly-engaged and active (most have probably spent most of their time online in an Internet cafe). \u2022 Lots of folks with two phones. A feature phone for calling, and an older smartphone for games, apps and other computer-like activities. This is their version of an affordable tablet/computer, I guess, and feeds back to the above. \u2022 A great many smartphone users still evidently on pre-pay deals, as they toggle 3G data settings on/off. Also watched a number of people toggle location on/off, presumably to check-in on Facebook or Foursquare, while taking into account older devices have older batteries which drain quicker. \u2022 Most tablet usage appeared (at least from what I saw) to be among middle-class and upwards. Spotted more Galaxy Tabs than iPads, but not sure that is a country-wide trend.

These elections are seen as a crucial test of democracy in the world&apos;s fourth most populous country, as they should result in Indonesia&apos;s first democratic transfer of power from one elected leader to another. Indonesia offers a laudable example of a Muslim-majority country that has thrown off dictatorship and blossomed economically under a democratic system. But for whoever wins, the challenge to keep Indonesia united and move from a developing country to a developed is huge for a nation strung across 17,000 islands and home to hundreds of ethnic groups and cultures. A bigger test to democracy than the demographic diversity is the fact that this will be the first time power will be handed from one elected president to another. The incumbent, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was the first president to be directly elected since the fall of the former authoritarian ruler Suharto in 1998. The continuation of a strong democracy is vital for what is south-east Asia&apos;s largest economy today, a member of G20 and one of the best performing economies globally. Indonesia&apos;s economy is projected to be the seventh largest globally by 2030 but will this economic potential be stifled by high levels of corruption and infrastructure bottlenecks? On Thursday 17 July, we explore development in Indonesia following the election and take a look at how the its policy landscape will have to evolve to get 32 million Indonesians out of poverty and reassure investors in the business community. With a parliament still dominated by individuals who rose to prominence during the Suharto era, how feasible is Indonesia&apos;s fresh start?

We share a language and a rich history \u2013 and, in the main, a sense of humour. We are both maritime trading nations. Australia inherited many fine British institutions including parliamentary democracy and the common law. Yet, as a recent Lowy Institute poll demonstrates, too often the relationship is focused on the past rather than the future, on sentiment rather than shared interests. More than eight in 10 Australians see the Australia-Britain bilateral relationship as important (with 28% saying it is &quot;very important&apos;&apos;). However, when asked to choose Australia&apos;s &quot;best friend&apos;&apos; from a list of six countries, respondents ranked Britain third in popularity behind the US and New Zealand. And when those who saw the relationship as important were asked why, two-thirds said it was because of the &quot;strong historical and cultural ties between our two countries&quot;. Only one in four Australians said it was because Britain was a major economic and strategic power, even though it is a top 10 economy, a nuclear weapons state and a permanent member of the UN security council. This is a good time, therefore, for our two nations to move beyond history, culture and cricket, and focus our relationship on our shared interests in the region towards which the world&apos;s wealth and power is shifting rapidly: Asia. One vehicle for doing so is the Australia-UK Asia dialogue, which was recently announced by Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop and British foreign secretary William Hague this year, and co-hosted in Britain by the Ditchley Foundation and the Lowy Institute. This brought together experts and high-level officials from the two countries, and while the proceedings were private, we can convey our personal impressions as co-chairmen. Our two countries come at Asia from different geographic angles, yet we both have long histories in the region and deep knowledge of it. Our experience and analyses are complementary, and we should make more of them. We have strong trading and investment relationships with China that are complemented by robust diplomatic relationships: Chinese premier Li Keqiang has just wrapped up a visit to Britain, and President Xi Jinping is slated to visit Australia for the G20 summit later this year. On the other hand, we believe that neither of our national debates about Asia should ever be shrunk to the dimensions of China. We must think about the region as a whole, and tend carefully and pay more attention to our relations with Japan, Indonesia, India, South Korea and Vietnam. Both Australia and Britain are allies of the US \u2013 indeed we are arguably Washington&apos;s two most reliable allies. We both believe that American leadership remains of immense benefit to the world, and that right now more is needed, not less. We both support the strategic logic of Barack Obama&apos;s rebalance towards Asia, but are concerned that America&apos;s strategic discipline on this should not waver. Whatever the distractions of other troubles at home and abroad, Washington must not lose its focus on the pivot. US allies such as Canberra and London should speak clearly to the Obama administration on the importance of persisting with the rebalance, and they also should be prepared to help shoulder its burdens. This is because Australia and Britain have important and legitimate stakes in the Asian strategic order \u2013 no doubt more than our publics tend to assume. Both our nations benefit enormously from the region&apos;s prosperity, underwritten by a rules-based order and the US strategic presence. But we cannot be passive bystanders, simply hoping to sell as much as we can. The tensions in parts of the region, not least north-east Asia, are rising, and the risks of conflict are real. We need to help mitigate these risks and be clearer on how we would react if conflict were to break out. Both our nations have much to contribute to Asian security, from counter-piracy and the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean to typhoon relief in the Philippines and our partnership with Singapore, Malaysia and New Zealand through the five-power defence arrangements. Our navies have strong traditions of conducting defence diplomacy and helping other countries build capacity to face their own challenges, including in intelligence and counter-terrorism. In engaging with Asian partners, a commitment to free trade, liberal democratic values and a rule-of-law approach to regional security problems remains a shared strength of our two nations. We should not hesitate to speak out when these commitments and values are undermined by developments in the region. Asia is undergoing major strategic and political change, including an uptick in Chinese maritime assertiveness, the normalisation of Japan&apos;s defence position, and leadership transitions in the region&apos;s two largest democracies, India and Indonesia. This is precisely the time for regional and global stakeholders, such as Australia and Britain, to look for creative new ways to work together and with regional partners to help contribute to Asia&apos;s prosperity and stability. Our dialogue aims to do just that."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jul/15/charles-darwin-hms-beagle-library-online-evolution", "sentences": ["Led by John van Wyhe, a historian of science at the National University of Singapore, a research team compiled digital copies of what they believe to be the complete set of 404 books, including thousands of stunning illustrations, that accompanied Darwin aboard HMS Beagle."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-15T14:13:18Z", "title": "Charles Darwin's evolutionary reading: HMS Beagle's library goes online", "tags": ["Charles Darwin", "Evolution", "History of science", "Biology", "Science", "World news", "UK news", "People in science"], "article": "The lost collection of books that kept Charles Darwin company aboard HMS Beagle and provided inspiration for his later works on evolution has been made publicly available for the first time today. Hundreds of titles that filled the shelves of the ship&apos;s library on Darwin&apos;s five-year circumnavigation of the globe in the 1830s have been brought together and made freely available through the Darwin Online Beagle Library project. Led by John van Wyhe, a historian of science at the National University of Singapore, a research team compiled digital copies of what they believe to be the complete set of 404 books, including thousands of stunning illustrations, that accompanied Darwin aboard HMS Beagle. Among the titles are all 20 volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica, seven volumes of the Natural History of Invertebrate Animals by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, and James Cook&apos;s three-volume account of a Pacific Ocean voyage in the 1770s. Darwin was 22 years old in 1831 when he set off for the Amazon, Patagonia and the Pacific aboard the ship. The trip around the world was planned to take two years, but the Beagle did not return to England until October 1836. His notes from the Galapagos and other destinations were central to the development of his theory of evolution through natural selection, which he described in his 1859 book, On the Origin of Species. Darwin&apos;s voyage on the Beagle ranks as one of the most famous and important scientific voyages in history. &quot;People have been studying it for over a hundred years using whatever materials we can to find out about it, looking at his notes, and so forth, to try and understand how he discovered the things that he did,&quot; said van Wyhe. &quot;You can&apos;t do that without understanding what he read and what he based his findings on.&quot; Reconstructing the library provides a more complete picture of Darwin&apos;s world during the expedition. &quot;Darwin literally lived in the library for five years,&quot; said van Wyhe. &quot;The science of his day was already quite sophisticated. All these geology books and all these books on fossils. Darwin could build on what was already known and what had come before.&quot; Though most of the books aboard the Beagle were non-fiction, the library held a few works of fiction, including Milton&apos;s Paradise Lost, William Shenstone&apos;s poetry and one risqu\u00e9 Spanish novel Darwin is known to have read on the voyage. &quot;He was reading a Spanish novel, which is quite amazing,&quot; said van Wyhe. &quot;It was a Spanish novel about Queen Caroline, published in Barcelona, that was a sort of quasi-political, quasi-sexy, account of the adultery case against Caroline.&quot; The books onboard were identified through a number of methods including letters sent between crew members and their families, lines in Darwin&apos;s notebooks and his surviving book collection. The final number of books digitised for the project is close to a number stated by Robert FitzRoy, captain of the HMS Beagle. In a letter to his sister during an earlier voyage on 16 March 1826, FitzRoy wrote, &quot;I flatter myself I have a complete library in miniature, upwards of 400 volumes!&quot; According to Van Wyhe, 90% of the books may have belonged to FitzRoy, with the rest coming from the crew, and only a few brought along by Darwin. Crew members were encouraged to share books via the library for their common betterment. Wyhe believes the extensive collection were partly responsible for inspiring Darwin&apos;s later revolutionary ideas. &quot;Just imagine, no TV, no internet, just day after day on that boat and there&apos;s nothing, just the library.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jul/15/china-town-aedas-architecture-giant-london", "sentences": ["They have built a gargantuan conference centre in China that looks like a teetering stack of mirror-clad Jenga blocks, an enormous concert hall in Singapore in the shape of a crumpled beetle, and over 9.3m sq metres (100m sq ft) of shops, offices and hotels in variously sculpted towers across Asia and the Middle East.", "We think that&apos;s the way London needs to densify.\u201d Based in Hong Kong since 1983, when he worked on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters with Norman Foster, Griffiths has built up an empire of offices across Asia, with bases in 13 cities, from Shanghai and Singapore to New Delhi and Dubai.", "The Star Performing Arts Centre in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-15T14:29:32Z", "title": "China town: meet the architecture giant with Asian designs on London", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Cities", "China", "Planning policy", "Society", "Culture", "Retail industry", "Business", "Commercial property", "Real estate", "Asia Pacific"], "article": "Their buildings dot the globe, but you probably couldn&apos;t name one, nor would you ever guess they had come from the same practice. They have built a gargantuan conference centre in China that looks like a teetering stack of mirror-clad Jenga blocks, an enormous concert hall in Singapore in the shape of a crumpled beetle, and over 9.3m sq metres (100m sq ft) of shops, offices and hotels in variously sculpted towers across Asia and the Middle East. Now Aedas, one of the largest architecture practices in the world, plans to bring its flashy brand of mixed-use huge projects to London. And there is very little to stand in their way. \u201cOur Chinese clients have their sights set on London, and they know what they want,\u201d says Keith Griffiths, the Welsh-born chairman of Aedas, who presides over the 1,400-strong practice from its Hong Kong headquarters. \u201cThey are used to high rise, high density, truly mixed-use developments \u2013 having everything on one site, so you can live, work and play without ever leaving the building. We think that&apos;s the way London needs to densify.\u201d Based in Hong Kong since 1983, when he worked on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters with Norman Foster, Griffiths has built up an empire of offices across Asia, with bases in 13 cities, from Shanghai and Singapore to New Delhi and Dubai. Last week Aedas announced a demerger from its European offices, where the scale of work was on a &quot;different trajectory&quot; (i.e. too small), but it has already set up a new base in London with the aim of importing its high-octane brand of gigantic Asian projects to Europe. The company has come to specialise, Griffiths says, in a particular kind of urban development that has grown out of these fast-paced emergent economies. It is a design philosophy that conceives chunks of cities like self-contained ocean liners: clusters of high rise buildings that are \u201cglued together\u201d at their bases on podiums that brim with retail and leisure, usually perched on top of major transport nodes.     The Star Performing Arts Centre in Singapore. Photograph: Aedas    \u201cThe closest London has come is Canary Wharf, but that&apos;s just a shopping mall servicing office blocks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt dies when the offices turn their lights off. We&apos;re talking about full 24-hour occupation, with a continuity of excitement between all the different floors, and blocks linked by elevated walkways above the streets.\u201d It is a form of mall urbanism that is now ubiquitous across Asia, as urban street patterns are trampled beneath galumphing glass behemoths. The city&apos;s ground level is surrendered to cars, while pedestrians scuttle between air-conditioned retail hubs overhead. They are self-contained commercial ecosystems, built and managed by single private interests, on a scale that makes London&apos;s biggest developments look like tiny specks on the planner&apos;s map. Such projects, says Griffiths, are usually between 465\u2013930,000 sq metres (5-10m sq ft) in China. Westfield Stratford City, London&apos;s Olympic shopping Mecca whose developers claim is Europe&apos;s largest such complex, is just 177,000 sq metres (1.9m sq ft). On the edge of Beijing&apos;s Olympic site, Aedas has completed the North Star mixed-use development, comprising a six-storey podium of swooping shopping arcades, from which 100m-tall towers rise into the smoggy skies. It is built on a plot measuring 200m x 200m, which the company&apos;s design director, Andrew Bromberg, describes as an \u201cextremely small site\u201d. By no means the worst of its kind, it is one of many such generic developments that are increasingly defining the nature of the Chinese capital: hermetic indoor worlds sprouting above stations, with little connection to the life of the street outside \u2013 because the street is usually a six-lane motorway.     The six-storey North Star development in Beijing. Photograph: Aedas    \u201cIn Asia you can easily get away with six storeys of retail, no problem,\u201d says Bromberg, before flicking to a slide of the practice&apos;s Nanfung complex in Guangzhou. Opposite the world&apos;s largest conference centre, it&apos;s a pair of hulking towers of staggered blocks that look like the result of a glitch in the computer modelling programme. \u201cPeople see the photos of the project and say, &apos;Where&apos;s the humanism in this?&apos;\u201d he admits. \u201cBut when you see it in China, you realise it&apos;s actually very contextual.\u201d He flicks through more slides of wide-angle photos and dazzling renderings, showing floor plates stretched into ever more unlikely shapes and cladding systems wrenched around twisted lumps, as different global cities merge into one free-form soup of contorted mirror glass. There is Centre 66 in Wuxi, a 372,000 sq metre (4m sq ft) complex of shops and office towers clustered around a Ming dynasty hall, and renderings for Xihongmen in Beijing, a 465,000 sq metre (5m sq ft) development on the Fifth Ring road, shaped like a troupe of streamlined golden tanks ready to charge at the city. Each sculpted carapace contains interiors of sparkling shopfronts arranged around swirling atria, visions of economic growth and prosperity, unperturbed by the fact that the country&apos;s largest mall still stands empty almost a decade after it was completed. Such inward-looking buildings, which often span several city blocks, may be \u201ccontextual\u201d to the new cities of China in some architects&apos; eyes, but how such ambitions translate to London remains questionable, where news of 230 new towers planned across the city has renewed scrutiny of the skyline.     Plan for the Xihongmen development in Beijing. Photograph: Aedas    China&apos;s biggest developers \u2013 from Greenland and Vanke, to Dalian Wanda and ABP \u2013 are already flocking to the capital in response to demand from the country&apos;s burgeoning billionaire class, looking to park their money overseas. Last year ABP signed a \u00a31bn deal to transform the Royal Docks into an Asian business district, while Greenland bought Wandsworth&apos;s Ram Brewery, slated for a 36-storey tower, and a site in Canary Wharf, where it plans the tallest residential building in Europe. In 2013 the Chinese were granted the most tier-one investor visas for the UK (which fast-tracks the immigration process for those investing more than \u00a31m in the country), overtaking Russia for the first time. In 2003 there were no dollar billionaires in China; this year, the Hurun Global Rich List recorded 358. With the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the strength of the renminbi versus the pound, London is an increasingly attractive proposition \u2013 and practices like Aedas are only too ready to provide the same services their clients are used to back home. But at what cost to the city? \u201cLondon can&apos;t continue just putting these towers up everywhere,\u201d says Griffiths. \u201cThe city&apos;s infrastructure can&apos;t cope with densification across the board. It needs to densify at nodal points, and we think these big integrated mixed-use developments, connected around stations at first and second-floor level, are the answer.\u201d It might sound like a vision from Blade Runner, but it is a proposition that dates back more than half a century, to a grand plan for a future London connected by elevated walkways. In 1947, in a wave of postwar optimism, Charles Holden and William Holford developed a plan for a network of routes at first-floor level that would connect buildings across the City. Most extensively completed around the Barbican estate, the Pedway scheme was abandoned by the 1980s, incomplete and partially demolished, as the tide turned against the idea of separating pedestrians from the streets below. (Its history is loving documented in the film Elevating London). The same happened in many US cities that had adopted elevated skywalks, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Cincinnati, where raised walkways resulted in empty pavements and deserted downtowns, forming cities that were physically separated by economic class, socially stratified in concrete and steel. After 30 years in Hong Kong, the spiritual home of the elevated walkway and urban escalator, Griffiths is optimistic that its lessons can be transferred. \u201cIf you have enough pedestrian activity, then the street doesn&apos;t die,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are three levels of the city in Hong Kong, and they&apos;re all flourishing.\u201d As London&apos;s increasingly international development market brings not only overseas investment, but the physical realities of urban forms spawned in the high-speed laboratories of Asia&apos;s developing cities, the skyline debate might end up being the least of our worries. The next frontier will be a wave of ground-scraping mega-buildings looking to gobble up our streets, making an ever more privatised, polarised city, all conveniently swept indoors."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/15/conservatives-reshuffle-europe", "sentences": ["Tuesday&apos;s moves will be seen by many as a Conservative project to remove Britain from the council chambers and common agreements of postwar Europe and to redefine the UK as a deregulatory isolationist offshore financial centre \u2013 Singapore with nuclear weapons \u2013 within the next three years."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-15T18:49:46Z", "title": "The Guardian view on the reshuffle and Europe | Editorial", "tags": ["Conservatives", "EU referendum and Brexit", "European commission", "Human Rights Act", "Human rights", "Politics", "David Cameron", "Foreign policy", "Law"], "article": "Moving with a clarity that poses a campaign challenge to Labour, David Cameron on Tuesday pointed the Conservative party in a more markedly Eurosceptic direction than ever before in his pre-election reshuffle. There were several components of this sharper-edged approach: a succession of Eurosceptic appointments to key ministerial positions; the forced exit of the House of Commons&apos; sole remaining Tory Europhile Ken Clarke; the sacking of the last of the John Major-era Europragmatists; and the nomination of a low-profile technocrat to be Britain&apos;s commissioner. This part of the reshuffle was intended to arm the Tory party not just for a general election battle with Ukip but also for the intended referendum on the UK&apos;s EU membership. In parallel, Mr Cameron unmistakably began doing something that is no less alarming for having been long trailed. He is clearing the ground for an election pledge to repeal the Human Rights Act and to withdraw the UK from the European convention on human rights. Tuesday&apos;s moves will be seen by many as a Conservative project to remove Britain from the council chambers and common agreements of postwar Europe and to redefine the UK as a deregulatory isolationist offshore financial centre \u2013 Singapore with nuclear weapons \u2013 within the next three years. The evidence gets stronger by the day. The first problem with the reshuffle in the European context is the removal of checks and balances that, until now, have kept Conservative Euroscepticism on a relatively tight rein. The replacement of William Hague, a big figure and a pragmatic foreign secretary, by Philip Hammond, a lesser successor who has indicated that as things stand he would vote to leave the EU, tilts the balance towards an isolationist approach. The exit of Mr Clarke removes the only Tory round the cabinet table with the instinct to challenge the drift out into the Atlantic. Although the departure of the Eurosceptic Owen Paterson and the vanity of Liam Fox&apos;s refusal to return to office in a subordinate position are some comfort, it may only be a matter of time before the interplay of Tory party politics begins to remorselessly raise the EU renegotiation bar much higher than would have been allowed in the Hague and Clarke era. The second problem is the momentum towards abandoning the convention, which would leave Britain alone with Belarus as non-signatory European nations. The sacked attorney general Dominic Grieve, backed by Mr Clarke and the Lib Dems, possessed both the principles and the clout to see that the UK&apos;s reputation, and its standing as a critic of human rights abuses elsewhere, including Russia, would be disastrously undermined by abandoning the convention. Mr Grieve&apos;s departure, plus Damian Green&apos;s exit from the Home Office, removes all that. It opens the way to the coarser anti-rights populism promoted by Chris Grayling and indulged by Mr Cameron. The prime minister now has a much freer hand to pursue this policy. Lord Hill&apos;s nomination as the next EU commissioner may seem an oddly modest decision in these more dramatic contexts. Mr Cameron has selected a good negotiator, a practical administrator and an effective operator. But he has done this because Nick Clegg, under the coalition code, had the power to stop a more confrontational or higher-profile choice. If Lord Hill does his job in Jean-Claude Juncker&apos;s new European commission, he may help to provide Mr Cameron \u2013 if he is still prime minister \u2013 with some of the reforms that could enable him to recommend a yes vote in a 2017 referendum. The fact that Mr Cameron is playing hardball now may mask a readiness to compromise later. If nothing else, Tuesday exposed the emptiness of complaints that there is no difference between our political parties. The difference revealed last night is enormous. The signals from Mr Cameron add up to a real and present danger which, carried to their conclusion, could redefine this country&apos;s place in the world for the worse, for years to come."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jul/16/world-cup-failures-may-ignite-eagerly-anticipated-asian-cup", "sentences": ["A promotional campaign from an anti-betting organisation in Singapore seemed to have scored an own goal when choosing eventual World Cup winners Germany as an example of a failed bet.", "Perhaps the ad men in Singapore can turn that into a promotional campaign to wow the masses."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T05:05:00Z", "title": "World Cup failures may ignite hugely important Asian Cup", "tags": ["Asian Cup 2015", "Australia", "South Korea", "Japan", "Football", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "A promotional campaign from an anti-betting organisation in Singapore seemed to have scored an own goal when choosing eventual World Cup winners Germany as an example of a failed bet. The advert was later tinkered with to maintain its relevance in the wake of Die Mannschaft\u2019s success, an effort to save face in what could have easily have turned out to be a car-crash. It\u2019s tempting to draw parallels with the Asian teams who failed so spectacularly in Brazil. As far as adverts go, the World Cup wasn\u2019t the best for the Asian Cup. Highlights would struggle to fill a 30-second commercial - three points from 12 games is not much to write a tome about and when the continent\u2019s best perform so poorly, the arrival of the rest may struggle to get juices flowing. The situation is not yet lost however. Asia\u2019s failure in South America may make Australia 2015 a harder sell but also makes the tournament more interesting and meaningful. Holding the Asian Cup so soon after the World Cup was always going to have consequences. Japan and South Korea, the two star attractions - after Australia, who did enough to provide some optimism - doing so badly doesn\u2019t help to build excitement. It\u2019s not all doom and gloom though. For the East Asian giants, the tournament is looming larger than it ever has and that is good news for the Asian Football Confederation. For the rest, what happened in Brazil should give confidence that the big boys can be beaten. It should be fun. Despite June&apos;s disappointment, defending champions Japan are not in a terrible place. Results and performances have hit fans hard and heavily discounted Samurai Blue-related merchandise is languishing in stores but the four years of Alberto Zaccheroni were not wasted even if the Italian flunked his biggest test. Japan need some new blood to freshen the ranks and a savvier coach to bring more flexibility and a winning mentality. Overall though, the foundation is there. Australia is the perfect opportunity for the new man - Javier Aguirre should be announced shortly - to make his mark. Korean football is usually more volatile than their neighbour, certainly at the moment. The coach and the vice-president of the Korean FA have resigned and there is pressure on the disliked head of the technical committee to do the same. Some of the players who performed, or perhaps more accurately, didn\u2019t perform in Brazil are not very popular with many fans, angry at underachievement and a perceived \u2018football mafia\u2019 in charge of the game. The 2015 Asian Cup has been discussed like no other. Korea has not won the trophy since 1960. For a number of years, the country was far more interested in the Olympics (which, unlike the Asian Cup, offered players the chance to win military exemption) than the continental competition, something that contributed to the AFC moving their showpiece out of the summer Olympics cycle. Now, with the standing of the national team at its lowest point since sometime in the previous millennium, triumph in Australia is the best way back into the public\u2019s affection. The failure in Brazil may help in other ways. The possibility of some bigger stars in the bigger leagues of Europe developing \u2018niggling injuries\u2019 instead of heading on that mammoth trek down under to miss six weeks or more of the domestic season, has receded a little. European club coaches have grown accustomed to African players leaving mid-winter but the same has yet to sink in regarding their Asian personnel. The tournament in 2011 didn\u2019t help; Shinji Kagawa broke his foot and Park Ji-sung returned to Manchester United with niggles that kept him out for weeks. Despite that, the big names should be keen. As well as the restoration of pride, some of them are playing for their places with calls for new blood still ringing around. Even with committed teams and big names, there will still be still challenges for organisers when trying to fill stadiums next January. World Cup post-mortems have focused, rightly, on the need for the whole of Asia to improve in order to give its best teams the platform from which to compete with the world. A few signs in that direction would be welcome. The sight of Korea and Japan struggling in Brazil then strolling in Australia is not what the continent needs in January, nor what those countries want in the long-term. It is time for young and exciting contenders like Iraq and UAE to fulfill their considerable potential.  Some sort of challenge from the west is inevitable as 10 of the 16 participants hail from that corner of the continent. Such an imbalance does present promotional problems. There is passion and ability inside the region but outside, little is known about Iraq, UAE and Saudi Arabia. When it comes to Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, it\u2019s even less. The Asian football disconnect between west and east has long been an issue and it is not one that can be solved in Australia. Organisers don\u2019t always help themselves though and the 84,000 Stadium Australia is going to take some filling for certain, less than glamorous ties. I watched Qatar host Bahrain in a November 2011 World Cup qualifier at Al Sadd\u2019s 18,000 capacity stadium in Doha. It was half-full.             Reaching the same percentage of occupied seats in Sydney on January 19 would require selling 42,000 tickets \u2013managing that would be a greater achievement than the Socceroos getting out of its World Cup group. Unless North Korea sends the same army of headline-grabbing young female cheerleaders to Sydney in January that is heading to the South Korean city of Incheon in September for the Asian Games, the clash with Uzbekistan at the same mammoth arena may have more than a few empty seats. Historically, the tournament usually struggles to attract consistently high attendances but perhaps a little tinkering with venues and teams would have been prudent, with China and Japan much more capable of coming close to filling such a massive stadium. The World Cup may have tarnished \u2018Asia\u2019s football brand\u2019 somewhat and it may make the continent\u2019s flagship tournament a harder sell to potential customers in and outside Australia but it also means that the tournament is set to be the most keenly contested one yet. The big teams and the big stars are desperate for redemption while those not involved in Brazil are desperate for success. It is the most important Asian Cup ever. Perhaps the ad men in Singapore can turn that into a promotional campaign to wow the masses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/jul/16/brands-winners-world-cup-football", "sentences": ["Then there was the anti-betting ad commissioned by Singapore&apos;s National Council on Problem Gambling, whose ad was meant to deter gamblers from betting irresponsibly during the World Cup, but ended up leaving the advertisers red-faced."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T15:33:00Z", "title": "Three brands that were the surprise winners of World Cup 2014", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Marketing & PR", "Advertising", "World Cup"], "article": "Following Germany&apos;s deserved win earlier this week I began to ponder who exactly were the real winners and losers of the World Cup 2014?\u00a0I was intrigued watching how official sponsors such as Adidas and Sony compared with the non-sponsors in promoting their brands. Did the big sponsors come out on top or were the non-sponsors this year&apos;s winners? Certainly Adidas and Nike battled it out during the tournament, but official sponsor Adidas was the most talked about brand at the World Cup. It stormed ahead of its competitors with an increase of nearly 5 million followers across all platforms over the course of the tournament. It&apos;s interesting that the most talked about brands at the World Cup 2014 are not necessarily those that shelled out for a vast sponsorship package. Non-sponsors generated nearly three-quarters of all World Cup online ad share. Some brand stories were highly amusing: Belgium fan Axelle Despiegelaere landed a L&apos;Oreal campaign after a photo of her during the group stages of the World Cup went viral. But no sooner had L&apos;Oreal signed her up, it terminated her contract following the publication of photographs of her on a hunting trip that provoked outrage. Then there was the anti-betting ad commissioned by Singapore&apos;s National Council on Problem Gambling, whose ad was meant to deter gamblers from betting irresponsibly during the World Cup, but ended up leaving the advertisers red-faced. It shows a little boy saying: &quot;I hope Germany wins,&quot; when his friends ask who he thinks will win the World Cup. &quot;My dad bet all my savings on them.&quot; Enough said. But for me, the winners of World Cup 2014 were: 1) DanoneDanone&apos;s Activia yoghurt collaboration with Colombian pop princess Shakira managed to usurp most of the mega-brands. We all like to root for the underdog and the ad was the social video champion of the tournament.\u00a0\u00a0 Danone&apos;s success was helped by cameo appearances from famous footballers, including Lionel Messi and Brazil&apos;s Neymar, but it was also a video with a worthy cause, with viewers pledging to support the World Food Programme initiative. It was by far the most shared football ad of 2014, viewed more than 230m times. \u00a0            2) Beats by Dr DreBeats by Dr Dre was another winning brand. Although Fifa tried to ban the now iconic headphones, many of the tournament&apos;s players were spotted wearing them, including Neymar and Italy&apos;s Mario Balotelli. The ban made headlines for Beats, while official sponsor Sony sent free headsets to stakeholders in apology. The Beats video, featuring many of the World Cup players, went viral. It received more than 23m hits on YouTube.            3) SpecsaversSeveral brands jumped on the bandwagon of the Suarez biting incident, with parodies from Snickers, Listerine, Nando&apos;s and McDonald&apos;s. For me though, the cheeky Specsavers twitter campaign was by far the funniest. The brand sat two photographs side by side, pointing out the difference between the Italian footballer Chiellini and cannelloni, with the well known tag: &apos;Should&apos;ve gone to Specsavers&apos;. The tweet was retweeted more than 13,000 times within one hour and has been retweeted over 29,000 times.     Specsavers successfully parodies the Suarez biting incident.    So what does this teach us? The brands that approached the games with a simple but clever idea \u2013 and above all a sense of humour \u2013 captured the jubilant spirit of the global championship, and the attention of fans as a result. Sponsors and non-sponsors alike need to ensure that, as always, fans are at the heart of their campaigns.

Now many question whether the carrier can survive a second disaster in such a short time. &quot;It is a tragedy with no comparison. In the history of aviation, no airline has gone through two tragedies of this magnitude in a span of four months,&quot; said Mohsin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank. &quot;Even before the second incident, I have been very sceptical over the company&apos;s ability to survive beyond the second half of 2015. They are making huge losses \u2026 This is probably going to hasten that. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter who is at fault. The perception to the customer is &apos;I don&apos;t want to fly Malaysia Airlines any more&apos;, and to battle that is not easy.&quot; Shares in the carrier fell sharply on Friday, down 11% by the midday break in trading in Kuala Lumpur, as already negative investor sentiment deepened. In all, it has dropped by 35% this year. Questions were also raised about the airline&apos;s choice of route, after it emerged that some other carriers had avoided the area for months \u2013 though many companies were flying in the same area, rerouting only after Thursday&apos;s disaster. The carrier, and the Malaysian government, came under heavy criticism for its handling of MH370&apos;s disappearance \u2013 particularly in China, which lost more than 150 nationals in that disaster. While any airline and any nation would have struggled with the extraordinary twists and turns in a mystery that remains unresolved, relatives complained of confused and contradictory information and insensitivity on the part of the government and company. At Kuala Lumpur International airport on Thursday night, angry relatives demanded to see the passenger manifest, but could not find a Malaysia Airlines official, Reuters reported. &quot;We have been waiting for four hours. We found out the news from international media. Facebook is more efficient than MAS. It&apos;s so funny, they are a laughing stock,&quot; one young man told reporters angrily. While the two Malaysia Airlines flight disasters are clearly very different, the uncanny coincidences are likely to resonate. &quot;This comes very close [in time]; it was the same airline; the same aeroplane type. It happened outside the more common way of crashing for big airlines; most accidents happen close to landing or just after takeoff. They both have an element of mystery and perhaps unlawful and external interference,&quot; noted Sidney Dekker, an expert on aviation safety at Griffith University. &quot;If the public is willing to keep them separate and say they really have little to do with each other, and any common link is not Malaysia Airlines, you can probably survive with the brand relatively intact,&quot; he said. But that is a big if. Five years after Trans World Airlines flight 800 crashed into the ocean near New York in 1996 with the loss of 230 lives, the carrier filed for bankruptcy and was acquired by American Airlines. For an already troubled company, the disaster was the straw that broke the camel&apos;s back, said Dekker. For others, a disaster may well mean &quot;rebranding, rebadging, a new air operator&apos;s certificate&quot;. The Malaysian transport minister, Liao Tiong Lai, declined to comment on the airline&apos;s future at a press conference about the disaster on Friday, describing that as a separate issue. Prior to MH370&apos;s disappearance, Malaysia Airlines was making losses but seemed to be improving, said Mohsin; it was reducing operating costs and selling more tickets. But while its flights were increasingly full, it had not managed to bump up its fares. Now the airline&apos;s previously strong safety record has effectively been erased for passengers by two such losses. According to the International Air Transport Association, there were an average of 517 deaths annually in commercial aviation incidents between 2009 and 2013. Now a single airline appears to have surpassed that death toll in a single year. &quot;People are only willing to fly with Malaysia Airlines if the ticket price is really, really cheap,&quot; said Mohsin. The airline has also faced additional costs, such as supporting the families of victims and increasing its spending on marketing. Reuters reported earlier this month that Malaysian state investor Khazanah Nasional Bhd planned to take MAS private as the first step towards restructuring the company, citing two unnamed sources. &quot;For it to completely disappear would be too much of a loss of pride for Malaysia,&quot; said the Maybank analyst. &quot;It is more realistic or probable for the government to intervene directly or via Khazanah.&quot; One key question is whether the airline should have chosen another course for the Boeing-777, given that two aircraft had been downed in the region that week. Malaysia Airlines said early on Friday: &quot;The usual flight route was earlier declared safe by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. International Air Transport Association has stated that the airspace the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.&quot; Cathay Pacific, Australia&apos;s Qantas and Korea&apos;s two major carriers are among airlines that stopped flying over Ukrainian airspace months ago due to concerns. &quot;Although the detour adds to flight time and cost, we have been making the detour for safety, and until the Ukrainian situation is over we will continue to take the detour route for our cargo flight out of Brussels,&quot; an Asiana Airlines Inc spokeswoman told Reuters. But many major players were still flying through the area, though Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines and others, such as China Eastern, have stopped using that airspace in the wake of the disaster. &quot;&apos;What&apos;s wrong with Malaysia Airlines?&apos; is completely the wrong question to ask and will lead us down a rabbit hole of entirely useless thinking,&quot; said aviation expert Dekker. &quot;It is pure chance. I flew through Ukrainian airspace on Monday with my daughter. It could have been us.&quot; While pilots ultimately have the discretion to refuse to fly along a particular course if they have concerns, they do not make the routes. Those are based on a multitude of factors, including airspace charges and wind speeds that affect journey times, but also, of course, safety. While the US Federal Aviation Authority had cautioned American carriers not to fly over the Crimean peninsula, there was no such warning for the area where MH17 came down. Ukrainian officials had closed airspace to 32,000ft (9,750 metres), but MH17 was flying 1,000ft above that. &quot;What I have heard raised in various guises is the broader question: can we come to more efficient international agreements about where to avoid flying and where to fly?&quot; said Dekker."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2014/jul/18/mh17-heathrow-top-departure-point-planes-near-east-ukraine", "sentences": ["Singapore Airlines (SIA) flew 75, Ukraine International Airlines (AUI) flew 62, and German airline Lufthansa (DLH) flew 56.", "The European Cockpits Association said: \u201cThe route flown by the lost Malaysian aircraft is the most common route for flights from Europe to South East Asia.\u201d  Although that cannot be confirmed just with this data, airports in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia were all included in the top ten arrival points.", "Changi aiport in Singapore had the most with 74."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-18T18:23:51Z", "title": "MH17: Heathrow top departure point for planes that flew near east Ukraine", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "World news", "Heathrow", "Air transport"], "article": "More flights that flew over or near eastern Ukraine departed from London Heathrow than for any other airport over the past seven days, according to flight radar data analysed by the Guardian. Seventy nine flights that were confirmed to have left from Heathrow were picked up by FlightRadar24 as having come within 86.4 miles of a point within the city centre of Donetsk - roughly 50 miles from where flight MH17 crashed last night. In total, 930 flights were detected to have entered the region but specific flight numbers were not available for 100 of them. The territory does just overlap with the Russian border so some flights could have just avoided entering Ukraine itself.       When you include other airports such as Manchester and Birmingham, the UK was the departure point for 90 of the flights. That means more than one in 10 of the aircraft where the flight number was confirmed came from the UK.      The data covers every flight which comes in an 86.4 mile radius of a point in Donetsk.    Amsterdam-Schiphol, where the crashed MH17 flight departed on Thursday morning was the source of 37 flights. Russia had more than any other country with 147. Although an average of more than 130 planes a day were detected in the runup to the crash, a look at the FlightRadar24 map now shows that flights over the region are now a lot sparser. Which airline operators were flying over the region? There were 86 planes that passed over the Donetsk region in the past week and flew under the AFL operator code, which is registered to Aeroflot. Singapore Airlines (SIA) flew 75, Ukraine International Airlines (AUI) flew 62, and German airline Lufthansa (DLH) flew 56.       Malaysia Airlines, the operator of the MH17 flight that was shot down on Thursday, was the next most frequent operator with 48 flights over the week. The Abu Dhabi-based airline Etihad said its planes did not fly over the nearby airspace. However, the FlightRadar24 data suggested that it had flown 26 flights over the region over the past week. In a statement provided to the Guardian Friday, Etihad said: &quot;On 17 July 2014, in the aftermath of the MH17 incident, we stated that we did not operate services over Ukrainian airspace. This was incorrect and we would like to apologise for this miscommunication. &quot;Following advice from relevant regulatory and airspace authorities in March this year, we implemented flight paths to avoid restricted airspace around the Crimean Peninsula extending out into the Black Sea. &quot;We continued to operate flights on air routes over Ukrainian airspace, which we were advised by the authorities, were safe. &quot;We can confirm that we have now suspended all flights over Ukrainian airspace.&quot; Where were the flights heading? The European Cockpits Association said: \u201cThe route flown by the lost Malaysian aircraft is the most common route for flights from Europe to South East Asia.\u201d  Although that cannot be confirmed just with this data, airports in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia were all included in the top ten arrival points. Thirty four flights travelling near Donetsk were bound for Kuala Lumpur International Airport. One of those was the ill-fated MH17.       Heathrow came joint-second for airport most of these flights were bound for with Indira Ghandhi International in Delhi. Changi aiport in Singapore had the most with 74.  Below is a count of how many flights were matched to each airline detected within 86.4 miles of Donetsk over the past seven days. You can sort it by number of flights or by alphabetical order.

As air traffic control authorities banned all aircraft from flying through eastern Ukrainian airspace \u2013 which is likely to increase flight costs and journey times \u2013 it has emerged that several airlines had already chosen to avoid the area. A spokesman for Qantas said the Australian flag carrier had not used the route for months. Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific said it had been taking a detour for &quot;quite some time&quot;. British Airways, Korean Air Lines, Air Berlin, Asiana Airlines and Taiwan&apos;s China Airlines had also been avoiding the east Ukraine route - which is the most commonly used between Europe and Asia - for months. British Airways declined to comment on its previous flight routes. Eurocontrol, which manages the European air transport network, said MH17 was flying at approximately 33,000ft, 1,000ft above closed airspace. Since the crash, the Ukrainian authorities have completely closed airspace over eastern Ukraine, known in air traffic control terms as Dnipropetrovsk flight information region. &quot;All flight plans that are filed using these routes are now being rejected by Eurocontrol. The routes will remain closed until further notice,&quot; the agency said. The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a safety bulletin in conjunction with Eurocontrol and the UN&apos;s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on 3 April, advising that Crimean airspace in southern Ukraine should be avoided. However, the directive did not apply to the airspace over Ukraine being used by flight MH17 when it was brought down. On Friday the ICAO stressed it was up to individual member states to declare unsafe areas of airspace. &quot;ICAO does not declare airspace safe or unsafe or undertake any other direct operational responsibilities with respect to civilian air services,&quot; said spokesman Anthony Philbin, according to a Reuters report. &quot;It is always the responsibility of our sovereign member states to advise other states of potential safety hazards,&quot; he said. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration issued any previous guidance about eastern Ukrainian airspace before flight MH17 was shot down, despite attacks on other aircraft in the erea in the past month. Malaysia&apos;s transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said: &quot;The airspace the aircraft was traversing was unrestricted. I think since it&apos;s an approved route it is safe and that&apos;s the reason why we have been using this route.&quot; Around 200-300 of the daily flights on the route had diverted elsewhere in recent months, according to FlightRadar24 data. However, about 100 aircraft a day from more than 60 different airlines were seen in the region over the past week. A Singapore Airlines jet from Copenhagen to Singapore was flying within 20 miles of flight MH17 at the time of the crash, according to the FlightRadar24 data. Philip Plantholt, of FlightRadar24, said: &quot;There were for sure commercial aircraft within a 25km radius.&quot; The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said airlines depended on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which airspace was available for flight, and safety was carriers&apos; top priority. Nico Voorbach, president of the pilots&apos; body the European Cockpit Association, called on aviation authorities to take immediate measures to secure all flights in the region. John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, said airlines selected routes based on cost efficiency, taking into account the effects on journey times of wind at high altitude. &quot;Safety is always first, airlines are certainly not wilfully putting their passengers and aircrew at risk,&quot; he said. &quot;Airlines pick routes known to be the most cost efficient and fastest in flying time, but that is all secondary to safety.&quot; Strickland said routes could vary by hundreds of miles each day depending on wind conditions. He said longer routes would not just increase fuel costs, which account for 30% of flight costs on average, but also play havoc with airline timetables. &quot;Longer flights will anger passengers, and mean that planes aren&apos;t in the right places at the right time, which can have knock-on effects around the world,&quot; he said. Geoff Dell, an accident investigation and safety specialist at CQ University in Australia, said airlines should not have chosen routes that flew over the area. &quot;It&apos;s blatantly obvious they shouldn&apos;t have been anywhere near it,&quot; Dell said. &quot;Any sort of unrest breaks out, civil wars or such, you change your flight path so that you don&apos;t have to go anywhere near it. Of course it comes at a cost, because you have to fly further.&quot; While airlines pick the routes for flights, pilots can refuse to accept specific route plans. Brent Spencer, director of the air traffic control programme at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, told Bloomberg: &quot;The fact that the airspace is not restricted doesn&apos;t mean you don&apos;t need to give extra consideration. You might want to think twice about flying through an airspace where there&apos;s somebody shooting missiles.&quot; Tony Tyler, the CEO of the International Air Transport Association, which represents 240 airlines, said they relied on authorities for guidance. &quot;It is very similar to driving a car. If the road is open, you assume that it is safe. If it&apos;s closed you find an alternate route,&quot; he said. &quot;No airline will risk the safety of their passengers, crew and aircraft for the sake of fuel savings. Airlines depend on governments and air traffic control authorities to advise which air space is available for flight, and they plan within those limits.&quot; Elizabeth Quintana, senior research fellow for air power and technology and director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, said the diversion of all flights for the foreseeable future would have cost implications for airlines. &quot;Diverting flights will add to fuel and logistic costs for airlines, which already have very low profit margins,&quot; she said. &quot;Fuel makes a massive difference if planes have to make a massive detour.&quot; She said airlines&apos; costs dropped considerably when Nato forces secured Afghanistan, as they had previously taken big detours to avoid the area. &quot;As missile systems develop, and the Chinese and Russians sell them around the world, this problem is not going to go away,&quot; Quintana said. President Obama announced on Friday that A National Transportation Safety Board investigator and the FBI are going to the site of the Malaysia Airlines crash. However, it was unclear who is leading the investigation, or how the NTSB will even gain access to the crash scene. Around 30 investigators from the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe were turned away from the miles-long crash scene by pro-Russian separatists, Friday afternoon. The NTSB did not say when an investigator might leave for Ukraine."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/19/mh17-changing-course-storms-pilot", "sentences": ["Its flight MH17 was only a few miles from an Air India Boeing 787 and a Singapore Airlines 777 when it was shot down."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-19T19:16:47Z", "title": "Pilots' group president says MH17 shot down after attempt to avoid storms", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "World news", "Malaysia"], "article": "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was guided off its most recently used course as its pilots hoped to avoid thunderstorms brewing in the south of Ukraine, it has been claimed. When it was shot down, the doomed jet was many miles north of the flight paths it had used on previous days to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport. Nico Voorbach, a pilot who flew the same journey earlier this summer for KLM, and who is president of the European Cockpit Association, said poor weather might have been the reason why flight MH17 found itself in the sights of a surface-to-air missile launcher. The aircraft was shot down in the separatist Donetsk region of east Ukraine. Voorbach said: &quot;I heard that they were diverting from some showers. I think there were thunderclouds. You would ask air traffic control to divert left or right, and they would give you the permission.&quot; It also emerged that flight MH17 had initially filed a flight plan requesting to fly at 35,000ft above Ukrainian territory. On entering Ukrainian airspace, however, the plane&apos;s pilots were instructed to fly at 33,000ft by the local air traffic control due to other traffic. Malaysia Airlines said the pilots had to follow the lead of the local authorities. Malaysia&apos;s transport minister, Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai, told a press conference: &quot;MH17&apos;s flight path was a busy major airway, like a highway in the sky. It followed a route which was set out by the international aviation authorities, approved by Eurocontrol, and used by hundreds of other aircraft. &quot;MH17 flew at an altitude that was set and deemed safe by local air traffic control, and it never strayed into restricted airspace. The flight and its operators followed the rules. But on the ground, the rules of war were broken.&quot; In response to claims that weather led to MH17 changing its flight plan, Malaysia Airlines director of operations Izham Ismail said that it had no reports from the pilot to suggest that this was the case. The airline has been keen to stress that after the International Civil Aviation Organisation in April identified an area over the Crimea peninsula as risky, its aircraft had &quot;at no point&quot; flown into or requested to fly into the area. The tragedy has, however, raised questions over the wisdom of commercial airlines continuing to fly over conflict zones. Airlines currently take their cue on risk from national governments, who are responsible for the airspace over their territories, although states have an interest in keeping flight paths open because they are able to collect overflight fees. The UK Civil Aviation Authority recently urged UK-based airlines not to fly over a wide area near the Crimea, Black Sea and Sea of Azov, and several airlines, including British Airways, have followed that advice. Others, however, had been continuing to use the route, which is one of the &quot;aerial motorways&quot; between northern Europe and south Asia. Malaysia Airlines was one of more than a dozen that flew the route on Thursday. Its flight MH17 was only a few miles from an Air India Boeing 787 and a Singapore Airlines 777 when it was shot down. The only restriction placed on the route by the Ukrainian government was that aircraft must remain above 32,000ft. Voorbach said that the European Cockpit Association, which represents 38,000 pilots at the EU level, would discuss the possibility of more rigorous rules this week at its next board meeting. He added that there might now be an argument for a total ban on flying over conflict zones, but that the repercussions of such a change, including longer flight times and extra costs to airlines, could be huge for the aviation industry. He said: &quot;Do we stop planes flying over Israel, for example? Looking across the world, stopping flights over conflict zones would add a huge burden to the aviation industry. We need to see what the inquiry into the disaster discovers. I just hope that politics does not get in the way of the inquiry.&quot; Since the crash, all airspace in eastern Ukraine has been closed."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/19/glasgow-2014-commonwealth-games-miscellany-history-souvenirs", "sentences": ["\u25a0 Asia: Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, India, Malaysia, Maldives, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri\u00a0Lanka."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-19T21:00:09Z", "title": "Glasgow 2014: Commonwealth Games miscellany, from history to souvenirs", "tags": ["Commonwealth Games 2014", "Commonwealth Games", "Sport"], "article": "THE GAMES Glasgow is the 20th of the quadrennial Games, which began in Hamilton, Canada, in 1930, to increase inclusivity, diversity and ambition in the Empire.

THE CEREMONIES Rod Stewart and Susan Boyle will sing in front of 40,000 during Wednesday\u2019s opener at Celtic Park, which also features a Parade of Nations and the end of the Queen\u2019s Baton Relay after its journey via each of the 71 nations. Huw Edwards and Hazel Irvine commentate on BBC1 from 8pm (no mention yet of Trevor Nelson). The closing ceremony on 3 August stars Kylie Minogue. THE VENUES Look out for Hampden Park (athletics, after a \u00a314m refit to raise the pitch by 1.9 metres and install a running track), Celtic Park (opening ceremony), Ibrox (rugby sevens), Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, Tollcross International Swimming Centre, Scotstoun campus (squash and table tennis), The Emirates Arena (badminton), Kelvingrove Lawn Bowls Centre, SECC Precinct (six sports including boxing and gymnastics), National Hockey Centre, Strathclyde Country Park (triathlon), Cathkin Braes Mountain Bike Trails and Glasgow Green (start of marathon and cycling\u2019s road race and time trial). Further afield, diving is at the Royal Commonwealth Pool in Edinburgh and shooting at Barry Buddon, near Dundee. THE TELEVISION Feel the London 2012 nostalgia as the Beeb goes into full-on sport mode: live coverage from 9am to 10.30pm on BBC1 and BBC3. Even EastEnders is shunted to BBC2. Gary Lineker is back from Brazil and in action alongside your Hazel Irvines and your Gabby Logans. The BBC\u2019s studio is on the banks of the River Clyde. Clare Balding and Mark Chapman present highlights nightly from 10.40pm. THE SPORTS The Games comprise 17 sports: aquatics, athletics, badminton, boxing, cycling, gymnastics, hockey, judo, lawn bowls, netball, rugby sevens, shooting, squash, table tennis, triathlon, weightlifting and wrestling. Lawn bowls, netball and squash are the non-Olympic sports; rugby sevens will make its Olympic debut in 2016. THE HOSTS The 1990 European City of Culture \u2013 now officially just \u201ca City of Culture\u201d \u2013 is full of it this summer: theatre, music, film, comedy and dance events plus designated party zones making up \u201cFestival 2014\u201d. Among the highlights: a Mela at Glasgow Green on 30 July, and a 250-boat Clyde flotilla on 26 July. THE MASCOT London 2012\u2019s one-eyed aliens Mandeville and Wenlock had a tough reception, but Glasgow\u2019s Clyde, left, has been less controversial \u2013 a cartoon thistle-man designed by competition winner Beth Gilmour. Organisers say Clyde is a \u201ccheeky wee thistle\u201d with \u201cstrong, sporty thistle arms and legs\u201d. He posts selfies at @Clyde2014. THE CONTROVERSIES A modest set of pre-Games headlines so far: an athletes village norovirus outbreak, an anti-homophobia protest, narrowly averted BBC industrial action, and a dust-up over the official Scottish opening ceremony uniform, designed in a turquoise, fuchsia and navy tartan. Thousands have signed a petition to have it replaced; cabinet secretary Shona Robison says it is \u201cbold\u201d and \u201ccolourful\u201d. THE SOUVENIRS An extensive set of options: official souvenir stamps, Clyde the mascot T-shirts, caps, water bottles, bags, mugs and cuddly toys (the 100cm tall Clyde is yours for \u00a3100), and an array of adult wear, including a \u00a345 ladies tartan pashmina."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/20/rise-of-data-death-of-politics-evgeny-morozov-algorithmic-regulation", "sentences": ["Yes, these systems are terrifyingly efficient \u2013 in the same way that Singapore is terrifyingly efficient (O&apos;Reilly, unsurprisingly, praises Singapore for its embrace of algorithmic regulation).", "And while Singapore&apos;s leaders might believe that they, too, have transcended politics, it doesn&apos;t mean that their regime cannot be assessed outside the linguistic swamp of efficiency and innovation \u2013 by using political, not economic benchmarks."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-19T23:05:00Z", "title": "Why the internet of things could destroy the welfare state", "tags": ["Technology", "Internet of things", "Internet", "Google", "Welfare", "Smart homes", "Big data", "Facebook", "Social networking", "Politics", "Government data", "UK news"], "article": "On 24 August 1965 Gloria Placente, a 34-year-old resident of Queens, New York, was driving to Orchard Beach in the Bronx. Clad in shorts and sunglasses, the housewife was looking forward to quiet time at the beach. But the moment she crossed the Willis Avenue bridge in her Chevrolet Corvair, Placente was surrounded by a dozen patrolmen. There were also 125 reporters, eager to witness the launch of New York police department&apos;s Operation Corral \u2013 an acronym for Computer Oriented Retrieval of Auto Larcenists. Fifteen months earlier, Placente had driven through a red light and neglected to answer the summons, an offence that Corral was going to punish with a heavy dose of techno-Kafkaesque. It worked as follows: a police car stationed at one end of the bridge radioed the licence plates of oncoming cars to a teletypist miles away, who fed them to a Univac 490 computer, an expensive $500,000 toy ($3.5m in today&apos;s dollars) on loan from the Sperry Rand Corporation. The computer checked the numbers against a database of 110,000 cars that were either stolen or belonged to known offenders. In case of a match the teletypist would alert a second patrol car at the bridge&apos;s other exit. It took, on average, just seven seconds. Compared with the impressive police gear of today \u2013 automatic number plate recognition, CCTV cameras, GPS trackers \u2013 Operation Corral looks quaint. And the possibilities for control will only expand. European officials have considered requiring all cars entering the European market to feature a built-in mechanism that allows the police to stop vehicles remotely. Speaking earlier this year, Jim Farley, a senior Ford executive, acknowledged that &quot;we know everyone who breaks the law, we know when you&apos;re doing it. We have GPS in your car, so we know what you&apos;re doing. By the way, we don&apos;t supply that data to anyone.&quot; That last bit didn&apos;t sound very reassuring and Farley retracted his remarks. As both cars and roads get &quot;smart,&quot; they promise nearly perfect, real-time law enforcement. Instead of waiting for drivers to break the law, authorities can simply prevent the crime. Thus, a 50-mile stretch of the A14 between Felixstowe and Rugby is to be equipped with numerous sensors that would monitor traffic by sending signals to and from mobile phones in moving vehicles. The telecoms watchdog Ofcom envisions that such smart roads connected to a centrally controlled traffic system could automatically impose variable speed limits to smooth the flow of traffic but also direct the cars &quot;along diverted routes to avoid the congestion and even [manage] their\u00a0speed&quot;. Other gadgets \u2013 from smartphones to smart glasses \u2013 promise even more security and safety. In April, Apple patented technology that deploys sensors inside the smartphone to analyse if the car is moving and if the person using the phone is driving; if both conditions are met, it simply blocks the phone&apos;s texting feature. Intel and Ford are working on Project Mobil \u2013 a face recognition system that, should it fail to recognise the face of the driver, would not only prevent the car being started but also send the picture to the car&apos;s owner (bad news for teenagers). The car is emblematic of transformations in many other domains, from smart environments for &quot;ambient assisted living&quot; where carpets and walls detect that someone has fallen, to various masterplans for the smart city, where municipal services dispatch resources only to those areas that need them. Thanks to sensors and internet connectivity, the most banal everyday objects have acquired tremendous power to regulate behaviour. Even public toilets are ripe for sensor-based optimisation: the Safeguard Germ Alarm, a smart soap dispenser developed by Procter &amp; Gamble and used in some public WCs in the Philippines, has sensors monitoring the doors of each stall. Once you leave the stall, the alarm starts ringing \u2013 and can only be stopped by a push of the soap-dispensing button. In this context, Google&apos;s latest plan to push its Android operating system on to smart watches, smart cars, smart thermostats and, one suspects, smart everything, looks rather ominous. In the near future, Google will be the middleman standing between you and your fridge, you and your car, you and your rubbish bin, allowing the National Security Agency to satisfy its data addiction in bulk and via a single\u00a0window. This &quot;smartification&quot; of everyday life follows a familiar pattern: there&apos;s primary data \u2013 a list of what&apos;s in your smart fridge and your bin \u2013 and metadata \u2013 a log of how often you open either of these things or when they communicate with one another. Both produce interesting insights: cue smart mattresses \u2013 one recent model promises to track respiration and heart rates and how much you move during the night \u2013 and smart utensils that provide nutritional advice. In addition to making our lives more efficient, this smart world also presents us with an exciting political choice. If so much of our everyday behaviour is already captured, analysed and nudged, why stick with unempirical approaches to regulation? Why rely on laws when one has sensors and feedback mechanisms? If policy interventions are to be \u2013 to use the buzzwords of the day \u2013 &quot;evidence-based&quot; and &quot;results-oriented,&quot; technology is here to help. Come and hear Evgeny Morozov speak at the Observer Ideas festival          This new type of governance has a name: algorithmic regulation. In as much as Silicon Valley has a political programme, this is it. Tim O&apos;Reilly, an influential technology publisher, venture capitalist and ideas man (he is to blame for popularising the term &quot;web 2.0&quot;) has been its most enthusiastic promoter. In a recent essay that lays out his reasoning, O&apos;Reilly makes an intriguing case for the virtues of algorithmic regulation \u2013 a case that deserves close scrutiny both for what it promises policymakers and the simplistic assumptions it makes about politics, democracy and power. To see algorithmic regulation at work, look no further than the spam filter in your email. Instead of confining itself to a narrow definition of spam, the email filter has its users teach it. Even Google can&apos;t write rules to cover all the ingenious innovations of professional spammers. What it can do, though, is teach the system what makes a good rule and spot when it&apos;s time to find another rule for finding a good rule \u2013 and so on. An algorithm can do this, but it&apos;s the constant real-time feedback from its users that allows the system to counter threats never envisioned by its designers. And it&apos;s not just spam: your bank uses similar methods to spot credit-card fraud. In his essay, O&apos;Reilly draws broader philosophical lessons from such technologies, arguing that they work because they rely on &quot;a deep understanding of the desired outcome&quot; (spam is bad!) and periodically check if the algorithms are actually working as expected (are too many legitimate emails ending up marked as spam?). O&apos;Reilly presents such technologies as novel and unique \u2013 we are living through a digital revolution after all \u2013 but the principle behind &quot;algorithmic regulation&quot; would be familiar to the founders of cybernetics \u2013 a discipline that, even in its name (it means &quot;the science of governance&quot;) hints at its great regulatory ambitions. This principle, which allows the system to maintain its stability by constantly learning and adapting itself to the changing circumstances, is what the British psychiatrist Ross Ashby, one of the founding fathers of cybernetics, called &quot;ultrastability&quot;. To illustrate it, Ashby designed the homeostat. This clever device consisted of four interconnected RAF bomb control units \u2013 mysterious looking black boxes with lots of knobs and switches \u2013 that were sensitive to voltage fluctuations. If one unit stopped working properly \u2013 say, because of an unexpected external disturbance \u2013 the other three would rewire and regroup themselves, compensating for its malfunction and keeping the system&apos;s overall output stable. Ashby&apos;s homeostat achieved &quot;ultrastability&quot; by always monitoring its internal state and cleverly redeploying its spare resources. Like the spam filter, it didn&apos;t have to specify all the possible disturbances \u2013 only the conditions for how and when it must be updated and redesigned. This is no trivial departure from how the usual technical systems, with their rigid, if-then rules, operate: suddenly, there&apos;s no need to develop procedures for governing every contingency, for \u2013 or so one hopes \u2013 algorithms and real-time, immediate feedback can do a better job than inflexible rules out of touch with reality. Algorithmic regulation could certainly make the administration of existing laws more efficient. If it can fight credit-card fraud, why not tax fraud? Italian bureaucrats have experimented with the redditometro, or income meter, a tool for comparing people&apos;s spending patterns \u2013 recorded thanks to an arcane Italian law \u2013 with their declared income, so that authorities know when you spend more than you earn. Spain has expressed interest in a similar tool. Such systems, however, are toothless against the real culprits of tax evasion \u2013 the super-rich families who profit from various offshoring schemes or simply write outrageous tax exemptions into the law. Algorithmic regulation is perfect for enforcing the austerity agenda while leaving those responsible for the fiscal crisis off the hook. To understand whether such systems are working as expected, we need to modify O&apos;Reilly&apos;s question: for whom are they working? If it&apos;s just the tax-evading plutocrats, the global financial institutions interested in balanced national budgets and the companies developing income-tracking software, then it&apos;s hardly a democratic success. With his belief that algorithmic regulation is based on &quot;a deep understanding of the desired outcome&quot;, O&apos;Reilly cunningly disconnects the means of doing politics from its ends. But the how of politics is as important as the what of politics \u2013 in fact, the former often shapes the latter. Everybody agrees that education, health, and security are all &quot;desired outcomes&quot;, but how do we achieve them? In the past, when we faced the stark political choice of delivering them through the market or the state, the lines of the ideological debate were clear. Today, when the presumed choice is between the digital and the analog or between the dynamic feedback and the static law, that ideological clarity is gone \u2013 as if the very choice of how to achieve those &quot;desired outcomes&quot; was apolitical and didn&apos;t force us to choose between different and often incompatible visions of communal living. By assuming that the utopian world of infinite feedback loops is so efficient that it transcends politics, the proponents of algorithmic regulation fall into the same trap as the technocrats of the past. Yes, these systems are terrifyingly efficient \u2013 in the same way that Singapore is terrifyingly efficient (O&apos;Reilly, unsurprisingly, praises Singapore for its embrace of algorithmic regulation). And while Singapore&apos;s leaders might believe that they, too, have transcended politics, it doesn&apos;t mean that their regime cannot be assessed outside the linguistic swamp of efficiency and innovation \u2013 by using political, not economic benchmarks. As Silicon Valley keeps corrupting our language with its endless glorification of disruption and efficiency \u2013 concepts at odds with the vocabulary of democracy \u2013 our ability to question the &quot;how&quot; of politics is weakened. Silicon Valley&apos;s default answer to the how of politics is what I call solutionism: problems are to be dealt with via apps, sensors, and feedback loops \u2013 all provided by startups. Earlier this year Google&apos;s Eric Schmidt even promised that startups would provide the solution to the problem of economic inequality: the latter, it seems, can also be &quot;disrupted&quot;. And where the innovators and the disruptors lead, the bureaucrats follow. The intelligence services embraced solutionism before other government agencies. Thus, they reduced the topic of terrorism from a subject that had some connection to history and foreign policy to an informational problem of identifying emerging terrorist threats via constant surveillance. They urged citizens to accept that instability is part of the game, that its root causes are neither traceable nor reparable, that the threat can only be pre-empted by out-innovating and out-surveilling the enemy with better communications. Speaking in Athens last November, the Italian philosopher Giorgio Agamben discussed an epochal transformation in the idea of government, &quot;whereby the traditional hierarchical relation between causes and effects is inverted, so that, instead of governing the causes \u2013 a difficult and expensive undertaking \u2013 governments simply try to govern the effects&quot;.     Governments' current favourite pyschologist, Daniel Kahneman. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    For Agamben, this shift is emblematic of modernity. It also explains why the liberalisation of the economy can co-exist with the growing proliferation of control \u2013 by means of soap dispensers and remotely managed cars \u2013 into everyday life. &quot;If government aims for the effects and not the causes, it will be obliged to extend and multiply control. Causes demand to be known, while effects can only be checked and controlled.&quot; Algorithmic regulation is an enactment of this political programme in technological form. The true politics of algorithmic regulation become visible once its logic is applied to the social nets of the welfare state. There are no calls to dismantle them, but citizens are nonetheless encouraged to take responsibility for their own health. Consider how Fred Wilson, an influential US venture capitalist, frames the subject. &quot;Health\u2026 is the opposite side of healthcare,&quot; he said at a conference in Paris last December. &quot;It&apos;s what keeps you out of the healthcare system in the first place.&quot; Thus, we are invited to start using self-tracking apps and data-sharing platforms and monitor our vital indicators, symptoms and discrepancies on our own. This goes nicely with recent policy proposals to save troubled public services by encouraging healthier lifestyles. Consider a 2013 report by Westminster council and the Local Government Information Unit, a thinktank, calling for the linking of housing and council benefits to claimants&apos; visits to the gym \u2013 with the help of smartcards. They might not be needed: many smartphones are already tracking how many steps we take every day (Google Now, the company&apos;s virtual assistant, keeps score of such data automatically and periodically presents it to users, nudging them to walk more). The numerous possibilities that tracking devices offer to health and insurance industries are not lost on O&apos;Reilly. &quot;You know the way that advertising turned out to be the native business model for the internet?&quot; he wondered at a recent conference. &quot;I think that insurance is going to be the native business model for the internet of things.&quot; Things do seem to be heading that way: in June, Microsoft struck a deal with American Family Insurance, the eighth-largest home insurer in the US, in which both companies will fund startups that want to put sensors into smart homes and smart cars for the purposes of &quot;proactive protection&quot;. An insurance company would gladly subsidise the costs of installing yet another sensor in your house \u2013 as long as it can automatically alert the fire department or make front porch lights flash in case your smoke detector goes off. For now, accepting such tracking systems is framed as an extra benefit that can save us some money. But when do we reach a point where not using them is seen as a deviation \u2013 or, worse, an act of concealment \u2013 that ought to be punished with higher premiums? Or consider a May 2014 report from 2020health, another thinktank, proposing to extend tax rebates to Britons who give up smoking, stay slim or drink less. &quot;We propose &apos;payment by results&apos;, a financial reward for people who become active partners in their health, whereby if you, for example, keep your blood sugar levels down, quit smoking, keep weight off, [or] take on more self-care, there will be a tax rebate or an end-of-year bonus,&quot; they state. Smart gadgets are the natural allies of such schemes: they document the results and can even help achieve them \u2013 by constantly nagging us to do what&apos;s expected. The unstated assumption of most such reports is that the unhealthy are not only a burden to society but that they deserve to be punished (fiscally for now) for failing to be responsible. For what else could possibly explain their health problems but their personal failings? It&apos;s certainly not the power of food companies or class-based differences or various political and economic injustices. One can wear a dozen powerful sensors, own a smart mattress and even do a close daily reading of one&apos;s poop \u2013 as some self-tracking aficionados are wont to do \u2013 but those injustices would still be nowhere to be seen, for they are not the kind of stuff that can be measured with a sensor. The devil doesn&apos;t wear data. Social injustices are much harder to track than the everyday lives of the individuals whose lives they affect. In shifting the focus of regulation from reining in institutional and corporate malfeasance to perpetual electronic guidance of individuals, algorithmic regulation offers us a good-old technocratic utopia of politics without politics. Disagreement and conflict, under this model, are seen as unfortunate byproducts of the analog era \u2013 to be solved through data collection \u2013 and not as inevitable results of economic or ideological conflicts. However, a politics without politics does not mean a politics without control or administration. As O&apos;Reilly writes in his essay: &quot;New technologies make it possible to reduce the amount of regulation while actually increasing the amount of oversight and production of desirable outcomes.&quot; Thus, it&apos;s a mistake to think that Silicon Valley wants to rid us of government institutions. Its dream state is not the small government of libertarians \u2013 a small state, after all, needs neither fancy gadgets nor massive servers to process the data \u2013 but the data-obsessed and data-obese state of behavioural economists. The nudging state is enamoured of feedback technology, for its key founding principle is that while we behave irrationally, our irrationality can be corrected \u2013 if only the environment acts upon us, nudging us towards the right option. Unsurprisingly, one of the three lonely references at the end of O&apos;Reilly&apos;s essay is to a 2012 speech entitled &quot;Regulation: Looking Backward, Looking Forward&quot; by Cass Sunstein, the prominent American legal scholar who is the chief theorist of the nudging state. And while the nudgers have already captured the state by making behavioural psychology the favourite idiom of government bureaucracy \u2013Daniel Kahneman is in, Machiavelli is out \u2013 the algorithmic regulation lobby advances in more clandestine ways. They create innocuous non-profit organisations like Code for America which then co-opt the state \u2013 under the guise of encouraging talented hackers to tackle civic problems.     Airbnb: part of the reputation-driven economy.    Such initiatives aim to reprogramme the state and make it feedback-friendly, crowding out other means of doing politics. For all those tracking apps, algorithms and sensors to work, databases need interoperability \u2013 which is what such pseudo-humanitarian organisations, with their ardent belief in open data, demand. And when the government is too slow to move at Silicon Valley&apos;s speed, they simply move inside the government. Thus, Jennifer Pahlka, the founder of Code for America and a protege of O&apos;Reilly, became the deputy chief technology officer of the US government \u2013 while pursuing a one-year &quot;innovation fellowship&quot; from the White House. Cash-strapped governments welcome such colonisation by technologists \u2013 especially if it helps to identify and clean up datasets that can be profitably sold to companies who need such data for advertising purposes. Recent clashes over the sale of student and health data in the UK are just a precursor of battles to come: after all state assets have been privatised, data is the next target. For O&apos;Reilly, open data is &quot;a key enabler of the measurement revolution&quot;. This &quot;measurement revolution&quot; seeks to quantify the efficiency of various social programmes, as if the rationale behind the social nets that some of them provide was to achieve perfection of delivery. The actual rationale, of course, was to enable a fulfilling life by suppressing certain anxieties, so that citizens can pursue their life projects relatively undisturbed. This vision did spawn a vast bureaucratic apparatus and the critics of the welfare state from the left \u2013 most prominently Michel Foucault \u2013 were right to question its disciplining inclinations. Nonetheless, neither perfection nor efficiency were the &quot;desired outcome&quot; of this system. Thus, to compare the welfare state with the algorithmic state on those grounds is misleading. But we can compare their respective visions for human fulfilment \u2013 and the role they assign to markets and the state. Silicon Valley&apos;s offer is clear: thanks to ubiquitous feedback loops, we can all become entrepreneurs and take care of our own affairs! As Brian Chesky, the chief executive of Airbnb, told the Atlantic last year, &quot;What happens when everybody is a brand? When everybody has a reputation? Every person can become an entrepreneur.&quot; Under this vision, we will all code (for America!) in the morning, drive Uber cars in the afternoon, and rent out our kitchens as restaurants \u2013 courtesy of Airbnb \u2013 in the evening. As O&apos;Reilly writes of Uber and similar companies, &quot;these services ask every passenger to rate their driver (and drivers to rate their passenger). Drivers who provide poor service are eliminated. Reputation does a better job of ensuring a superb customer experience than any amount of government regulation.&quot; The state behind the &quot;sharing economy&quot; does not wither away; it might be needed to ensure that the reputation accumulated on Uber, Airbnb and other platforms of the &quot;sharing economy&quot; is fully liquid and transferable, creating a world where our every social interaction is recorded and assessed, erasing whatever differences exist between social domains. Someone, somewhere will eventually rate you as a passenger, a house guest, a student, a patient, a customer. Whether this ranking infrastructure will be decentralised, provided by a giant like Google or rest with the state is not yet clear but the overarching objective is: to make reputation into a feedback-friendly social net that could protect the truly responsible citizens from the vicissitudes of deregulation. Admiring the reputation models of Uber and Airbnb, O&apos;Reilly wants governments to be &quot;adopting them where there are no demonstrable ill effects&quot;. But what counts as an &quot;ill effect&quot; and how to demonstrate it is a key question that belongs to the how of politics that algorithmic regulation wants to suppress. It&apos;s easy to demonstrate &quot;ill effects&quot; if the goal of regulation is efficiency but what if it is something else? Surely, there are some benefits \u2013 fewer visits to the psychoanalyst, perhaps \u2013 in not having your every social interaction ranked? The imperative to evaluate and demonstrate &quot;results&quot; and &quot;effects&quot; already presupposes that the goal of policy is the optimisation of efficiency. However, as long as democracy is irreducible to a formula, its composite values will always lose this battle: they are much harder to quantify. For Silicon Valley, though, the reputation-obsessed algorithmic state of the sharing economy is the new welfare state. If you are honest and hardworking, your online reputation would reflect this, producing a highly personalised social net. It is &quot;ultrastable&quot; in Ashby&apos;s sense: while the welfare state assumes the existence of specific social evils it tries to fight, the algorithmic state makes no such assumptions. The future threats can remain fully unknowable and fully addressable \u2013 on the individual level. Silicon Valley, of course, is not alone in touting such ultrastable individual solutions. Nassim Taleb, in his best-selling 2012 book Antifragile, makes a similar, if more philosophical, plea for maximising our individual resourcefulness and resilience: don&apos;t get one job but many, don&apos;t take on debt, count on your own expertise. It&apos;s all about resilience, risk-taking and, as Taleb puts it, &quot;having skin in the game&quot;. As Julian Reid and Brad Evans write in their new book, Resilient Life: The Art of Living Dangerously, this growing cult of resilience masks a tacit acknowledgement that no collective project could even aspire to tame the proliferating threats to human existence \u2013 we can only hope to equip ourselves to tackle them individually. &quot;When policy-makers engage in the discourse of resilience,&quot; write Reid and Evans, &quot;they do so in terms which aim explicitly at preventing humans from conceiving of danger as a phenomenon from which they might seek freedom and even, in contrast, as that to which they must now expose themselves.&quot; What, then, is the progressive alternative? &quot;The enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; doesn&apos;t work here: just because Silicon Valley is attacking the welfare state doesn&apos;t mean that progressives should defend it to the very last bullet (or tweet). First, even leftist governments have limited space for fiscal manoeuvres, as the kind of discretionary spending required to modernise the welfare state would never be approved by the global financial markets. And it&apos;s the ratings agencies and bond markets \u2013 not the voters \u2013 who are in charge today. Second, the leftist critique of the welfare state has become only more relevant today when the exact borderlines between welfare and security are so blurry. When Google&apos;s Android powers so much of our everyday life, the government&apos;s temptation to govern us through remotely controlled cars and alarm-operated soap dispensers will be all too great. This will expand government&apos;s hold over areas of life previously free from regulation. With so much data, the government&apos;s favourite argument in fighting terror \u2013 if only the citizens knew as much as we do, they too would impose all these legal exceptions \u2013 easily extends to other domains, from health to climate change. Consider a recent academic paper that used Google search data to study obesity patterns in the US, finding significant correlation between search keywords and body mass index levels. &quot;Results suggest great promise of the idea of obesity monitoring through real-time Google Trends data&quot;, note the authors, which would be &quot;particularly attractive for government health institutions and private businesses such as insurance companies.&quot; If Google senses a flu epidemic somewhere, it&apos;s hard to challenge its hunch \u2013 we simply lack the infrastructure to process so much data at this scale. Google can be proven wrong after the fact \u2013 as has recently been the case with its flu trends data, which was shown to overestimate the number of infections, possibly because of its failure to account for the intense media coverage of flu \u2013 but so is the case with most terrorist alerts. It&apos;s the immediate, real-time nature of computer systems that makes them perfect allies of an infinitely expanding\u00a0and pre-emption\u2011obsessed\u00a0state. Perhaps, the case of Gloria Placente and her failed trip to the beach was not just a historical oddity but an early omen of how real-time computing, combined with ubiquitous communication technologies, would transform the state. One of the few people to have heeded that omen was a little-known American advertising executive called Robert MacBride, who pushed the logic behind Operation Corral to its ultimate conclusions in his unjustly neglected 1967 book, The Automated State. At the time, America was debating the merits of establishing a national data centre to aggregate various national statistics and make it available to government agencies. MacBride attacked his contemporaries&apos; inability to see how the state would exploit the metadata accrued as everything was being computerised. Instead of &quot;a large scale, up-to-date Austro-Hungarian empire&quot;, modern computer systems would produce &quot;a bureaucracy of almost celestial capacity&quot; that can &quot;discern and define relationships in a manner which no human bureaucracy could ever hope to do&quot;. &quot;Whether one bowls on a Sunday or visits a library instead is [of] no consequence since no one checks those things,&quot; he wrote. Not so when computer systems can aggregate data from different domains and spot correlations. &quot;Our individual behaviour in buying and selling an automobile, a house, or a security, in paying our debts and acquiring new ones, and in earning money and being paid, will be noted meticulously and studied exhaustively,&quot; warned MacBride. Thus, a citizen will soon discover that &quot;his choice of magazine subscriptions\u2026 can be found to indicate accurately the probability of his maintaining his property or his interest in the education of his children.&quot; This sounds eerily similar to the recent case of a hapless father who found that his daughter was pregnant from a coupon that Target, a retailer, sent to their house. Target&apos;s hunch was based on its analysis of products \u2013 for example, unscented lotion \u2013 usually bought by other pregnant women. For MacBride the conclusion was obvious. &quot;Political rights won&apos;t be violated but will resemble those of a small stockholder in a giant enterprise,&quot; he wrote. &quot;The mark of sophistication and savoir-faire in this future will be the grace and flexibility with which one accepts one&apos;s role and makes the most of what it offers.&quot; In other words, since we are all entrepreneurs first \u2013 and citizens second, we might as well make the\u00a0most of it. What, then, is to be done? Technophobia is no solution. Progressives need technologies that would stick with the spirit, if not the institutional form, of the welfare state, preserving its commitment to creating ideal conditions for human flourishing. Even some ultrastability is welcome. Stability was a laudable goal of the welfare state before it had encountered a trap: in specifying the exact protections that the state was to offer against the excesses of capitalism, it could not easily deflect new, previously unspecified forms of exploitation. How do we build welfarism that is both decentralised and ultrastable? A form of guaranteed basic income \u2013 whereby some welfare services are replaced by direct cash transfers to citizens \u2013 fits the two criteria. Creating the right conditions for the emergence of political communities around causes and issues they deem relevant would be another good step. Full compliance with the principle of ultrastability dictates that such issues cannot be anticipated or dictated from above \u2013 by political parties or trade unions \u2013 and must be left unspecified. What can be specified is the kind of communications infrastructure needed to abet this cause: it should be free to use, hard to track, and open to new, subversive uses. Silicon Valley&apos;s existing infrastructure is great for fulfilling the needs of the state, not of self-organising citizens. It can, of course, be redeployed for activist causes \u2013 and it often is \u2013 but there&apos;s no reason to accept the status quo as either ideal or inevitable. Why, after all, appropriate what should belong to the people in the first place? While many of the creators of the internet bemoan how low their creature has fallen, their anger is misdirected. The fault is not with that amorphous entity but, first of all, with the absence of robust technology policy on the left \u2013 a policy that can counter the pro-innovation, pro-disruption, pro-privatisation agenda of Silicon Valley. In its absence, all these emerging political communities will operate with their wings clipped. Whether the next Occupy Wall Street would be able to occupy anything in a truly smart city remains to be seen: most likely, they would be out-censored and out-droned. To his credit, MacBride understood all of this in 1967. &quot;Given the resources of modern technology and planning techniques,&quot; he warned, &quot;it is really no great trick to transform even a country like ours into a smoothly running corporation where every detail of life is a mechanical function to be taken care of.&quot; MacBride&apos;s fear is O&apos;Reilly&apos;s master plan: the government, he writes, ought to be modelled on the &quot;lean startup&quot; approach of Silicon Valley, which is &quot;using data to constantly revise and tune its approach to the market&quot;. It&apos;s this very approach that Facebook has recently deployed to maximise user engagement on the site: if showing users more happy stories does the trick, so be it. Algorithmic regulation, whatever its immediate benefits, will give us a political regime where technology corporations and government bureaucrats call all the shots. The Polish science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem, in a pointed critique of cybernetics published, as it happens, roughly at the same time as The Automated State, put it best: &quot;Society cannot give up the burden of having to decide about its own fate by sacrificing this freedom for the sake of the cybernetic regulator.&quot; To Save Everything, Click Here: Technology, Solutionism, and the Urge to Fix Problems That Don&apos;t Exist by Evgeny Morozov is out now in paperback"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/23/bbc-proms-2014-orchestras-taking-part-for-first-time-global-classical-music", "sentences": ["And we\u2019ve got a surprise or two up our sleeves if we get asked to do an encore!The Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sascha Goetzel perform on 29 July  Lynette Seah, violin, Singapore Symphony Orchestra     Lynnette Seah: 'There is a growing demand for work by Singaporean composers.'", "Singapore\u2019s multicultural society is the perfect backdrop for the orchestra, which is able to act as a bridge between the musical traditions of Asia and the west.", "There is also a growing demand for work by Singaporean composers, of whom we will give four premieres this season.", "The Singapore Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lan Shui perform on 2 September  Riikka Silvonen, violin, Lapland Chamber Orchestra     Riikka Silvonen: 'Our audience responds positively to practically everything.'"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-23T11:18:28Z", "title": "Proms 2014: the orchestras taking part for the first time", "tags": ["Proms 2014", "Classical music", "Proms", "Culture", "Festivals", "Music", "UK news"], "article": "Ten international ensembles are making their first Proms appearance this year. Many are from countries that do not have an established tradition of classical music and operate outside the mainstream Euro-American hub that has dominated classical music for the past 300 years. Ten or 20 years ago many of these countries, which now boast world-class ensembles, barely even had an orchestra. We talked to players from the orchestras making their Proms debut and asked them to tell us about the role the orchestra plays in their country\u2019s cultural life. Yunpeng Zhao, cello, China Philharmonic Orchestra      Yunpeng Zhao: 'Audiences in China have really got into classical music.'    It means such a lot to be the first Chinese orchestra to perform at the Proms. We\u2019re all working at 120% to make the concert the best we possibly can and to be an inspiration to our fellow Chinese musicians. The orchestra\u2019s only 14 years old; I\u2019ve been part of it for six years. All the musicians are Chinese, although some of us, such as myself, studied abroad. About 10% of what we perform is Chinese music \u2013 rearrangements of traditional music \u2013 or new compositions by contemporary composers such as Tan Dun, Philip Glass and Peter Ruzicka. We perform sometimes with erhu soloists \u2013 a traditional Chinese two-stringed violin \u2013 while a permanent part of our percussion section is a huge drum native to China made of animal skin.  This last decade, audiences in China have really got into classical music: there are 11 or 12 orchestras today in Beijing alone, and I\u2019m seeing more and more young people in our audiences. Music education here is getting much better, parents are tough with their kids, but that does help them make progress. There\u2019s a lot of very talented young musicians in this country, and I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be more and more. We love how strongly our audiences react \u2013 we finish our last note and there\u2019s an explosion! Last week, we played Mahler 5 with Semyon Bychkov and it was simply one of the greatest experiences ever for musicians and audience alike. They went crazy. Maestro Bychkov came out to bow maybe 10 times \u2013 the audiences wouldn\u2019t let him go! But I think for me the strangest thing about performing outside of China will be how quiet audiences in the west are during performances. In China, some people chat and text on their cellphones and cough without covering their mouths.The China Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Long Yu performed on 19 July Sylvia Hosking, double bass, Melbourne Symphony Orchestra     Sylvia Hosking: 'In 2003 we performed with Kiss.'    I trained at the Royal Conservatoire in the Hague and New York\u2019s Juilliard school, but the plan always was to come back to Australia if I could, and the planets aligned and I got a job back in my hometown. The orchestra, founded in 1906, is the oldest professional orchestra in Australia. Today it has about 85 permanent members, some 90% of whom are Australians. The first two rounds of auditions are only open to Australians; only if no one suitable can be found are they then opened up to players from elsewhere. We focus on standard repertory: Mozart, Mahler, Tchaikovsky, but we also programme and promote Australian music, and showcase contemporary music in the annual Metropolis festival. We do all kinds of other performances too, from pops programmes to concerts with indigenous Australians and traditional instruments such as the didgeridoo. In 2003, we performed with Kiss \u2013 we got to wear the makeup. It was awesome! The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Andrew Davis perform on 19 August Kirill Bogatyrev, cello, Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra     Kirill Bogatyrev: 'Our audience at first was mostly expats, but the last few years more locals have come.'    Everyone knows the LSO and the BBC SO and suchlike but surely that all gets a bit boring \u2013 come and hear a new orchestra at the Proms! The Qatar Philharmonic was created in 2008. I grew up and trained in St Petersburg and have been playing with the QPO since it began. There\u2019s 30 different nationalities among the players, although none from Qatar itself. That might be set to change \u2013 two years ago, the first music academy opened in Doha where I and many of my colleagues teach. Each year, we do five or six school concerts with Arabic- and English-speaking programmes for students \u2013 we need to create a new generation of music lovers. Our audience at first was mostly expats, but the last few years more locals have come, and they bring their kids. This is all new to Qataris \u2013 they have a different musical tradition after all. We perform mostly traditional west European repertoire, with a great deal of Russian music \u2013 which obviously I love! We\u2019re bringing Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky to the Proms as well as the European premiere of Iranian composer Behzad Ranjbaran\u2019s Sunrise. We try to programme local music; Lebanese composer Marcel Khalife is in residence and we\u2019ve been joined by musicians from Morocco, Syria and Egypt. Our audience is open to everything, but of course audiences every\u00adwhere have the same preferences \u2013 a Mozart Requiem and Beethoven Ninth will always be full. The Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Han-Na Chang perform on 7 September Arngunnur \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir, clarinet, Iceland Symphony Orchestra     Arngunnur \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir: 'Our audience are open to the new and experimental.'    The orchestra was founded in 1950, six years after independence from Danish rule, the same year our national theatre opened \u2013 culture was seen as an important part in strengthening national identity. Today we\u2019ve got 92 members, roughly 80% of whom are natives of Iceland; that figure is on the rise. We have to be very versatile as players. We host the annual contemporary music festival Tectonics Reykjavik and collaborated recently with heavy-metal band Sk\u00e1lm\u00f6ld as well as with many other pop and rock artists. Our audience, similarly, are open to the new and experimental, and subscribers have more than doubled in the last five years. At the Proms we\u2019ll be playing two Icelandic works, Magna by Haukur T\u00f3masson and Geysir by J\u00f3n Leifs, pieces that describe the landscape of the country in music.The Iceland Symphony Orchestra conducted by Ilan Volkov perform on 22 August  Amy Salsgiver-Dorsay, percussion, Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra     Amy Salsgiver-Dorsay: 'You might notice some authentic Turkish percussion instruments.'    We\u2019re a part-time orchestra made up of the country\u2019s best musicians, who come together to perform once or twice a month in the season. I\u2019m from Cleveland, Ohio, one of only a handful of foreigners in the orchestra. I\u2019ve been part of it for 11 years \u2013 the orchestra itself is 16 years old. Istanbul is a cosmopolitan big city. Of course you have the orientalism and the traditional music, but most people are far more European than westerners expect. We perform the standard classical and romantic repertoire, less often new music \u2013 which is a little slow in coming to Turkey, although there\u2019s a small but growing audience. For our Proms debut we\u2019re giving the world premiere of Gabriel Prokofiev\u2019s Violin Concerto. The percussion section is thrilled \u2013 we get to play a lot and have some fun. It\u2019s a nice challenge and we\u2019re putting in the elbow grease at the moment, preparing it. You might also notice some authentic Turkish percussion instruments \u2013 finger-cymbals, darbuka and doumbek drums. And we\u2019ve got a surprise or two up our sleeves if we get asked to do an encore!The Borusan Istanbul Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sascha Goetzel perform on 29 July  Lynette Seah, violin, Singapore Symphony Orchestra     Lynnette Seah: 'There is a growing demand for work by Singaporean composers.'    I\u2019ve been with the orchestra since it was founded in 1979. Singapore\u2019s multicultural society is the perfect backdrop for the orchestra, which is able to act as a bridge between the musical traditions of Asia and the west. The Proms premiere of Zhou Long\u2019s piano concerto inspired by kung fu movements is a great example of this, with strong Chinese influences and the unmistakable sound of Chinese percussion. There is also a growing demand for work by Singaporean composers, of whom we will give four premieres this season. We\u2019ve many loyal regulars and supporters, and our Babies Proms \u2013 for under-sixes \u2013 always sell out. I particularly enjoy the family concerts at the Botanic Gardens, where we have an audience of 5,000 despite the tropical weather conditions! The Singapore Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lan Shui perform on 2 September  Riikka Silvonen, violin, Lapland Chamber Orchestra     Riikka Silvonen: 'Our audience responds positively to practically everything.'    Only four of the 18 players are not from Lapland and, as the orchestra grows, that figure is getting ever smaller. We\u2019re based in a new concert hall in Rovaniemi, but an important part of our work is travelling around Lapland (which covers about a third of Finland) to play for village audiences. We perform a wide range of music \u2013 from early baroque to avant-garde \u2013 and have just finished a Mozart symphony cycle. But we also play music from Finnish and Scandinavian composers and work with a local folk group; there\u2019s a powerful new wave of folk music in Finland today that influences several composers. Our audience responds positively to practically everything. I remember several years ago we gave a concert in Utsjoki, a village in the far far north. The small hall was packed with people, some dressed in their national Lappish costumes. At the end of the two-hour concert of hardcore contemporary music an old man sitting in the front row asked us: \u201cCan\u2019t you play something more?\u201dThe Lapland Chamber Orchestra conducted by John Storg\u00e5rds perform on 9 August  Otilia Alitei, violin, Armonia Atenea     Otilia Alitei: 'We're presenting music inspired by Greek mythology.'    There is not a big tradition for classical music in Greece, but I think in the last year we\u2019ve brought a new public to our concerts. We play any kind of music \u2013 operetta, opera, 19th and 20th century, contemporary. Even jazz, maybe once a year. Here they have a tradition more for romantic opera, bel canto, but not so much 17th-century music. So we started a baroque project, and in the last year have recorded five CDs. For the Proms, we\u2019re presenting music inspired by Greek mythology \u2013 we feel very proud to have been invited to present this programme in such a historic festival. It\u2019s a big challenge.Armonia Atenea conducted by George Petrou perform on 2 August Dale Kim, viola, Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra     Dale Kim: 'The number of international players has risen steadily this last decade.'    There\u2019s a classical music boom throughout Asia. Audiences are gaining a greater understanding, and since 2005, when the SPO relaunched as a semi-independent organisation, we\u2019ve upped our game. Everyone\u2019s on the same path \u2013 to establish a world-class orchestra and build a classical music tradition that will endure. Around 80% of us are Korean-born \u2013 but it\u2019s not something anyone cares about, and the number of international players has risen steadily this last decade. I\u2019m Korean Canadian and have been a member for six years. Alongside standard classical works, we play a lot of contemporary music. Unsuk Chin has been our composer-in-residence since 2006 and is also the artistic director of our contemporary music series. We\u2019re bringing one of her works, Su, the concerto for sheng (a traditional Chinese reed mouth organ) and orchestra to the Proms. I\u2019ve encountered the Proms so many times on YouTube and heard so much about them. To be there in flesh and blood, seeing and feeling for myself the energy that makes them so famous will be amazing.The Seoul Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Myung-Whun Chung perform on 27 August  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/23/taiwan-transasia-airways-plane-crash-penghu-island-typhoon-matmo", "sentences": ["In 2000, 83 of the 179 on board a Singapore Airlines flight died when it attempted to take off from the wrong runway at Taipei&apos;s Chiang Kai-shek international airport as a typhoon approached."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T02:14:00Z", "title": "Taiwan: 48 dead in TransAsia Airways plane crash", "tags": ["Taiwan", "Plane crashes", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Forty-eight people are dead and 10 injured after their plane crashed while trying to land at a Taiwanese airport on Wednesday evening, hours after typhoon Matmo battered the region. The transport minister Yeh Kuang-shih said TransAsia Airways flight GE222 had been attempting an emergency landing, which the airline said was necessary because of bad weather. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said conditions on Penghu, an island between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, had been suitable for incoming flights. The crash left wreckage tangled in the remains of a badly damaged building. The flight had taken off from Kaohsiung, in the south of Taiwan, bound for Penghu&apos;s Magong airport. Two people aboard the plane were French citizens and the rest Taiwanese, said the transport minister, Yeh Kuang-shih. The plane had been carrying 58 passengers and crew. The Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, said via a spokesman that it was &quot;a very sad day in the history of Taiwanese aviation&quot;. Jean Shen, director general of the CAA, said Magong air traffic controllers had lost contact with the flight during its go-around, when it was around 300 feet above the ground. She added that two flights had arrived safely just before GE222. Taiwan&apos;s Central News Agency (CNA) reported that the pilot had been asked to wait until 7.06pm before being allowed to make his first attempt at landing. It is not clear what caused the delay or why his initial attempt failed. The twin engine turboprop ATR-72 was due to take off at 4pm and arrive at Magong at 4.35pm, but did not leave Kaohsiung until 5.45pm, according to CNA. It was another hour and 20 minutes before it made its initial landing attempt. The country&apos;s Aviation Safety Council called an emergency meeting to look into the cause of the accident. Its head, Wang Hsing-chung, told CNA it was unclear whether bad weather or human error was to blame. In its statement TransAsia Airways said it was providing assistance to passengers and their families. It had also begun assisting the CAA and ASC investigation. It added that the plane had been in use for 13 years. It was in the hands of pilot Lee Yi-liang, who had 22 years of experience and almost 23,000 flying hours on his record, and co-pilot Chiang Kuan-hsing, who had two and a half years of flying experience and just under 2,400 hours. The flight had 54 passengers and four crew on board. According to the Flightradar24 website TransAsia Airways had cancelled almost all of its flights on Wednesday, presumably because of the bad weather. The defence department dispatched 200 troops to the scene to assist, Taiwan&apos;s Now News reported. Kaohsiung municipal government told Now News it had been in touch with TransAsia and requested the detailed list of passengers and crew members. A team from the CAA, aviation experts and relatives of the victims are due to fly to Magong on Thursday. Taiwan&apos;s weather agency said typhoon Matmo had brought gusts of up to 67mph (108km/h) as it blew through on Wednesday, knocking out power to more than 30,000 homes, before moving towards south-east China. Forecasters had warned heavy rains would continue into the evening. On the mainland, Fujian province officials said they had evacuated 300,000 people, but the typhoon weakened to a tropical storm as it reached the area. In 2000, 83 of the 179 on board a Singapore Airlines flight died when it attempted to take off from the wrong runway at Taipei&apos;s Chiang Kai-shek international airport as a typhoon approached. In 1998, a China Airlines jet a China Airlines jet from Bali failed in a first attempt to land at Taipei because of rain and fog, then stalled during the go-round and crashed into houses. All 196 on board and seven people on the ground died. In 2002 all 225 people on board a China Airlines flight died when it crashed en route from Taipei to Hong Kong in good weather. The wreckage was found 45km off Penghu and investigators said the plane had broken up in mid-air."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jul/24/deeper-than-skin-review-skin-colour-prejudice", "sentences": ["&quot;Singapore was ruled by English people who were white, and therefore to be lighter skinned was to ally yourself with those in power,&quot; says\u00a0Sing Sing from Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-24T16:00:00Z", "title": "Deeper Than Skin review \u2013 why people still think light skin is morally superior to dark skin", "tags": ["Radio", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Race issues"], "article": "As a child, I recall adults using the phrase &quot;She was nice, but dark&quot; to describe their contemporaries, casually subscribing to the notion, still prevalent, that light skin is cosmetically and morally superior to dark skin.

It&apos;s a tangle of prejudice from all sides. Amfo points the finger at the beauty industry (which uses subtext-heavy buzzwords such as &quot;illuminate&quot; to sell steroid-heavy products) and a celebrity culture that posits Lupita Nyong&apos;o as an &quot;exotic&quot; exception to the rule.

Democracy is up to the people: A successful democracy does not rely on a single personality or an elected leader. All people need to partake in political processes. Spaces for citizen participation and the emergence of a civil society have helped ease Indonesia\u2019s transition from dictatorship to democracy. High participation equals healthy democracy: The turnout to June&apos;s elections are a really good sign as it reflects that these people want to take a more active role in the country\u2019s democracy, suggesting democracy here has longevity. Melany Tedja, environmental finance consultant, a political observer and activist, Jakarta, Indonesia. @meltedja Use new tools to demand transparency: Most of the tools to create a more democratic system are recent tools developed by people through crowdsourcing \u2013 not yet part of an established system run by the government. They still run their meetings closed and they have no obligation to publish a copy of new laws passed within a certain timeline to the public.  Reach beyond the digital divide: Not enough has been done in Indonesia to create activist leaders beyond the middle class. Impactful activism has been restricted to those mainly with computer and internet access \u2013 that\u2019s only 10% of the population.  Ericssen, director of political desk, Global Indonesian Voices, Singapore. @EricssenWen @Givoices Political parties need to nurture new leaders from the grassroots: They have relied too heavily on prominent personalities but they need to develop their own nationwide \u201cparty machinery\u201d that give common citizens the chance to rise from bottom to the top through proper political process.  It takes many years to build a democracy: Indonesia\u2019s democracy is still low quality democracy. We have rule of law deficit, chronic corruption, incomplete control of armed forces, and inadequate protection of minorities. We want not only procedural democracy but also substantive democracy. This takes time. Balance the power between the president and political parties: When we amended our constitution after the fall of Soeharto, the main aim was to reduce the strong presidency which was the main characteristic of the regime. We still need to reduce number of parties in parliament as we have 10 currently, so the executive can avoid transactional political trade. Vikram Nehru, chair of Southeast Asian studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Washington DC, USA. @VikramNehru Encourage pluralism of ideas: When Indonesia has a well-functioning democratic system it will be reflected in a contest of ideas between candidates, not a contest of financial strength or the ability to smear. Regimes can change but the same people can hold the power: One of President Habibie&apos;s contributions as the transition president was keeping the political and economic elite of the country intact despite enormous social upheaval. That elite \u2013 severely weakened by the economic collapse of 1998 \u2013 has since regained strength and its return to its original position of power within the country was reflected in Prabowo&apos;s presidential campaign. Elections alone do not mean democracy. A growing middle-class keeps governments on track: A rising middle class tends to support more domestically driven growth. In addition, the middle class is usually more concerned with the quality of government services. As a result, they can become a powerful voice in pushing for government reforms, increasing government efficiency and transparency, and improving governance more broadly. Ahmad Faisol, executive director of MediaLink, Jakarta, Indonesia. @faisol80 Press, the law and the military all have a role to play: A good press law, a freedom of information law, and a military that remains neutral in politics are symbols that our democracy is working. The election clearly shows the importance of freedom of information and open government as the Election Commission can now disclose the raw data from polling booths as a resource for transparency. Tom Pepinsky, associate professor of government, Cornell University, New York, USA. @TomPepinsky A strong national identity supports democracy: All emerging democracies face the same challenge \u2013 creating inclusive growth and empowering citizens to take control of their political future. Indonesia does have one advantage: unlike many countries with similar levels of diversity and inequality, Indonesian do broadly share \u2018the idea\u2019 of Indonesia. That strength should not be underestimated. Evolution not revolution: It&apos;s been 15 years since democratisation, and Indonesia is still working out the kinks. The old players from the Suharto-era also need to fade away and there is no simple, institution fix for the problems that come with democratisation. Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher, Human Rights Watch, Jakarta, Indonesia. @andreasharsono  Media freedom comes before regime change: In 1997, there was a discussion about media freedom and democratisation in Indonesia. President Suharto was still in power. Pro-democracy activists were not rushing to topple Suharto but to fight for media freedom first. Helen Brown, Australia Network correspondent for ABC, Jakarta, Indonesia. @hbrown10  Democracy means different things to different people: A lot of Indonesians are frustrated about &apos;democracy&apos; and what it means to them, but the views of both sides have to be respected.  Speaking freely is a symbol of democracy: I spoke to a lot of young people about the elections and they were seriously weighing up the options. They were talking and not holding back, and that is a tremendous freedom, so I think that having a voice, and learning how to exercise it, has been a significant factor in Indonesia&apos;s transition.  When there is no fear about a return to a dictatorship, democracy has been achieved: Prabowo, the candidate with more Suharto-era links, gained a huge amount of ground in June, so there is obviously a large element of the population which were not concerned about any possible threats to the constitution (which lays out Indonesia&apos;s democracy), or the mixed messages he was giving about his commitment to it.

Hamilton\u2019s switch from McLaren to Mercedes late in 2012 was ridiculed by most people in Formula One at the time. But now the shrewdness of the British driver\u2019s career swerve, from a team in decline to one that could transform him into a multiple world champion, is recognised throughout the paddock. The move had its genesis eight years ago, a year before Hamilton drove in Formula One for the first time in 2007. That was when he was introduced to Simon Fuller, the inventor of Pop Idol, by his father, Anthony Hamilton. \u201cThere was an immediate rapport between the two,\u201d said a Formula One insider who witnessed their meeting. \u201cFuller\u2019s XIX Entertainment agency was about to negotiate David Beckham\u2019s move to LA Galaxy. He had global ambitions and they appealed to Lewis.\u201d In 2006 Hamilton also met Nick Fry, then the CEO at Honda Racing and the man who would take up the same position at the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One team; Fry, along with Mercedes\u2019 former team chief Ross Brawn, would play a pivotal part in the negotiations that resulted in Hamilton ending up at the Brackley-based racing outfit. Fry, 58, who left Mercedes last year, said on Friday: \u201cBetween myself, the team and Lewis there was the making of a relationship before he even got to drive in Formula One. I knew Simon Fuller very well too. There was always fertile soil there.\u201d Hamilton made his Formula One debut with McLaren in 2007 and in his breathtaking rookie season almost won the world championship. Hamilton did win the title in 2008, when he signed a five-year deal with the Woking team. But after that there was mostly frustration. He was fifth in 2009 and fourth in 2010, when Red Bull began their four years of dominance. It was then that Hamilton, frustrated by the commercial work he had to do for McLaren, approached Fuller as he looked for a fresh direction in management. In March 2011 Hamilton, after professionally splitting with his father, signed for Fuller\u2019s XIX Entertainment. But 2011 was also the nadir of Hamilton\u2019s career. There were clashes with stewards and other drivers and problems in his personal life, including difficulties with his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. \u201cHe is completely mad,\u201d said Niki Lauda, now one of his Mercedes bosses. There was more trouble when Hamilton introduced his rapper friend Ice-T to the McLaren garage. Ice-T\u2019s film made it to YouTube. \u201cHere we are, in the McLaren pit, some place you\u2019ll never be in your fucking life,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you F1 fans, I know all you motherfuckers right now are jackin\u2019 off to this. This is Lewis\u2019s car. See that steering wheel? Cost more than your fucking house.\u201d Hamilton\u2019s ability to reach rappers and gangsta, as well as petrolheads, appeared to unsettle Formula One. The sport\u2019s chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, told The Guardian: \u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster. He gets to meet people that probably he wouldn\u2019t have met and [who] have probably the wrong sort of influence on him. \u201cI think he had some personal problems during the year which affected him quite a lot. It depends an awful lot on the people you surround yourself with and who are in a position to influence you. I think he just fell into a lot of people that I think weren\u2019t good for him.\u201d But Hamilton\u2019s desperate unhappiness was also the catalyst for change, as was his new agent. Hamilton let it be known that he was on the lookout for a move. At the Plaza Hotel in New York, on 29 December 2011, Fuller and Fry met to discuss Hamilton\u2019s future. That contact was maintained through the first half of 2012 and the pair met again, this time more seriously, in London on 26 July. Hamilton\u2019s move to Mercedes was announced at the end of September 2012. Lauda, non-executive chairman at Mercedes, was given the credit for clinching the deal at the Singapore Grand Prix a week earlier. But in reality the deal had been sealed between Fry and Fuller weeks before that. Fry said: \u201cThe big thing for me is that Lewis should be given the credit for the move, because he made the decision. He was smart enough to realise that the team that could design and develop the chassis and the power plant as one unit, with all the complexities that involved, would have a big advantage in 2014.\u201d But it all started, in Italy, eight years ago."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/27/observer-editorial-work-life-balance-shorter-working-hours-shorter-working-week", "sentences": ["Professor Lynda Gratton of the London Business School has spent five years considering the future of work in conjunction with 21 global companies, including Nokia, BT, Save the Children and Singapore&apos;s ministry of manpower."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-26T23:01:00Z", "title": "The working week: cutting back on hours has many advantages | Observer editorial", "tags": ["Work-life balance", "Employment law", "Work & careers", "Carlos Slim", "Rich lists", "Money", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Carlos Slim, the Mexican telecoms billionaire and philanthropist, this month regained his position as the world&apos;s richest man (\u00a342bn), temporarily lost to Bill Gates last year. So, when he speaks, his gold-plated peers listen. Last week, he announced at a business conference in Paraguay his latest big idea \u2013 a global three-day, 33-hour week on full pay for workers moving into their sixth and seventh decades, and not yet ready to retire. According to one estimate, deferring the pension age by 12 months in the UK could save \u00a313bn a year. It seems a very long journey from the ordinances of the London Weavers&apos; Guild in 1321 to reduce the long working day, the 14-hour shifts that marked the Industrial Revolution and Henry Ford&apos;s 1914 revolutionary notion of the large-scale assembly line, but the theme is the same. Namely, the value of &quot;free&quot; time to the working man and woman balanced against the profit and loss of employment. This is the beginning of the summer holidays for many. It means for some a fortnight of liberation from paid work, &quot;doing nothing&quot; bar domestic duties, entertaining children and demonstrating tact with the visiting inlaws and trying to coax various pieces of equipment in the rented cottage/caravan/camp site into functioning without serious personal injury. This, the luxury of work-free time, however brief, means greater autonomy, less stress, relationships revived and opportunities to develop interests that may be of little value in monetary terms, but which enrich the soul. At least, that&apos;s the theory. &quot;Time off&quot; helps to focus the mind on the advantages of the shorter working week while it immediately raises a number of problems \u2013 both psychological for the workaholic and those in love with their jobs (a minority, apparently, since the global Blessing White survey reports that only 31% of the workforce in Europe say they are &quot;engaged&apos; in what they do), and practical, not least for those on low pay, contemplating an income still further reduced. However, given the scale of the challenges the world faces, for example in the devastation of its natural resources and the impact of ageing populations, reducing the paid working week has a number of advantages as the thinktank, New Economics Foundation (Nef) and the TUC, among others, have argued for years. In 21 Hours, for instance, a Nef paper published in 2010, Anna Coote argued that such a reduction would create more jobs. (The French government claimed that its 35-hour week \u2013 &quot;Work less. Live more&quot; \u2013 created 350,000 jobs before it was axed in 2008 under the slogan: &quot;Work more to earn more.&quot;) A 21-hour week would also restrain consumption since lower wages would mean less cash to flash, reduce high carbon emissions, tackle inequalities and improve well-being. A short week may seem unlikely but working patterns have proved remarkably flexible, particularly when driven by the desire to maximise profits. Since 2008, for example, the proportion of people working on temporary and zero-hours contracts has increased greatly. Even earlier, the arrival of women in the workplace in significant numbers in the 1970s introduced still greater variety or what a report by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation last week called &quot;flex appeal&quot;. Job share, annualised hours, term-time working and compressed hours all framed in the language of &quot;family friendly&quot; and &quot;work-life balance&quot; have, in practice, too often meant low wages and the forfeit of advancement. Now, there is a slowly growing corporate understanding that employees respond better to greater control over when they clock in and out and what matters is the outcome, not the hours a task takes. That, plus a combination of technology and the growth of the knowledge economy, is initiating even greater change. Microsoft, for instance, under the slogan &quot;Any time any where&quot;, allows working from home while Unilever advocates &quot;agile working&quot;. Companies such as National Grid and BT say diversity in work patterns results in greater retention of staff and lower recruitment costs, among other advantages. Unions and the employers in the highly successful UK car industry reduced hours to retain more jobs during the worst of the recession. In 1930, John Maynard Keynes predicted that employees would toil for only 15 hours and then face the challenge of &quot;how to use freedom from pressing economic cares&quot;. The long-predicted &quot;leisured society&quot; has yet to arrive for the UK workforce, but further reshaping of the working week is highly likely and to be welcomed, not least because while unemployment can be deadly, work may also make us sick. According to the Health and Safety Executive, in 2011-12, 22.7 million working days were lost due to work-related illnesses. Last week, a study published in the British Medical Journal said that shift work, previously linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure and diabetes, may also raise the risk of a heart attack by almost 25%. Again, earlier this month, John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, called for a four-day week to combat a rising tide of stress and the lack of time to recuperate properly. Professor Lynda Gratton of the London Business School has spent five years considering the future of work in conjunction with 21 global companies, including Nokia, BT, Save the Children and Singapore&apos;s ministry of manpower. One manifestation of the difficulties that young people today face in securing work, and expecting not a job for life but many changes and switches in career, she says, is that increasingly, they value the quality of their lives and time for themselves as much if not more than status and high pay, a rejection of what the late historian EP Thompson called the notion of time as &quot;a currency \u2013 not passed but spent&quot;. The global work place is a contradictory universe; progress is uneven. In some parts, the horrific conditions of the British Industrial Revolution continue while in the Swedish city of Gothenberg a one-year experiment is underway in which some of its employees enjoy a six-hour day to see how their performance compares with those on the standard eight hours, on the basis that fewer hours may prove more productive and enhance creativity. &quot;Time&apos;s arrow is broken,&quot; wrote Richard Sennett in The Corrosion of Character. &quot;It has no trajectory in a continually re-engineered, short-term\u2026. political economy.&quot; Out of austerity and necessity, however, it&apos;s just possible that such pessimism may be challenged. We may yet be forced to reshape work and, in the process, revalue what is among the most precious of all commodities \u2013 our free time."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/27/concorde-iphone-history-state-intervention-technological-innovation", "sentences": ["But it\u2019s China, Singapore, South Korea and Brazil where the success stories happened."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-27T19:00:06Z", "title": "From Concorde to the iPhone, state intervention drives technological innovation | Paul Mason", "tags": ["Economics", "Business", "Technology", "US politics", "US news", "World news", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Concorde"], "article": "If you wanted to radically alter the economy, making a country such as Britain as dynamic as China or Brazil, what would the state have to do? Intervene, obviously, but how? That has become a hard question to answer since the onset of free-market economics. Much of the old apparatus of state control has been dismantled. Plus, the political culture in which planners, engineers and technical innovators inhabited the same offices has been shattered. If a modern-day civil servant wanted to place the proposal to build, say, Concorde on a minister\u2019s desk, there wouldn\u2019t even be an obvious ministry to go to. It was the UK\u2019s Ministry of Supply that set up the supersonic airliner project: it commissioned a prototype aircraft, immediately, at its first meeting. When state innovation projects worked, they did so because their owners were politicians, who were allowed to think big and who accepted the risk of failure. In the freemarket model, the private sector is given the task of driving innovation. But though the individual results look spectacular \u2013 from info-tech, genetics and materials science to neuro-medicine \u2013 we have not experienced the same \u201clift-off\u201d as in previous industrial revolutions, where all the innovations synergise, producing high-dynamism and rising wealth for all. Instead, in the developed world, amid rapid tech innovation, we sway between low growth and stagnation. If the information revolution creates the possibility of a \u201cthird capitalism\u201d \u2013 as different from the industrial era as it was from the age of Sir Francis Drake \u2013 then it is, so far, a possibility unrealised. And a growing number of economists believe it will remain so unless we rethink the role of the state. The Sussex University professor Mariana Mazzucato, whose calls for an \u201centrepreneurial state\u201d were greeted with incomprehension four years ago, recently put together a conference attended by ministers, central bankers and serious investors. The buzzwords were: think big, and do \u201cmission-oriented finance\u201d. Mazzucato points out the state played a role in financing nearly every key technology in an iPhone, from GPS to the touch screen. She says that, even now, the lion\u2019s share of funding for climate change technologies comes from state investment banks and public utilities, with just 6% coming from private capital. The problem is, the modern state sees this as accidental and residual. It avoids major projects, and their associated risks, seeing its role as mainly to act where the market \u201cfails\u201d \u2013 as with the near evaporation of venture capital funding for technology startups in the UK. Mazzucato, in a paper with LSE professor Carlota Perez, points out the danger of leaving tech to the private sector. In an economy bloated with printed money and cheap credit, if capital can\u2019t find real-world, high-growth, high-profit opportunities to invest in, it will pool into the finance system, creating one bubble after another. Seen from this angle, the financial crisis looks less like the product of bad practices in the City, and more like a structural crisis. At all previous takeoff points, capital in the finance system flowed out into the real economy, where a paradigm had been established making it easy for businesspeople to invest in tried-and-tested models, with predictable and growing demand. Solving this problem is not just critical for economics. The clearest unmet need on Earth is for technologies to combat climate change. It\u2019s impossible for markets to direct climate science, or climate technology, because there is no ready-made framework that will make the innovations being tried profitable. It should be a no-brainer that the modern-day equivalent of Concorde or the Apollo projects \u2013 classic \u201cmission-oriented\u201d state projects \u2013 should be green technology. History shows innovation happens best when the state shapes it. During the second world war, the US decreed that companies could only profit from making and selling their military technologies \u2013 any attempt to derive immediate profit from monopolised intellectual property stood against the public good. Once they knew the American state was trying to achieve an anti-aircraft fire control system first, and a number-crunching static computer later, the greatest innovators alive set to work on making a gun predict the ideas in a fighter pilot\u2019s head. Mainframes \u2013 and other technologies \u2013 followed, and reaped high profits for the corporations that pioneered them. But it was the state that forced the take-off point to happen. Thinking big about the economic role of the state no longer means planned allocation of goods, or state provision: it means the state setting pathways for technology and rewarding those who follow them. That means that politicians and civil servants will have to do more than overcome their opposition to picking winners. It means changing the tax system to reward long-term investments in real activities, forcing the finance system to lend to value-creating businesses \u2013 and limiting the ability of corporates to use accumulated cash simply to buy their own shares, eating value out of the real economy. Five years on from Lehman Brothers, we\u2019re still seeing stagnation in terms of busted banks and country debts: if Mazzucato and her collaborators are right, the real problem is bigger \u2013 it concerns the economic culture of the state. Every takeoff point in history has seen the state reorganise the market and promote prosperity. The boom-bust cycles of the past 15 years show we\u2019re at a turning point, but in large parts of the developed world we have states that don\u2019t think they should exist. If the proponents of modern laissez-faire economics could point to a single economy where technology and markets had worked, alone, to create a vibrant, confident, high-growth economic model, their arguments would be stronger. But it\u2019s China, Singapore, South Korea and Brazil where the success stories happened. The state was at the centre of every one. Paul Mason is economics editor of Channel 4 News.

Sunday marked the end of the Tour de Cocos, the island\u2019s newly established annual bike race, and excited children lined up to collect their medals. Parents milled around with a beer or wine. Orders were being placed for the evening\u2019s pizza night. The locals were certainly aware of the day\u2019s drama. They just didn\u2019t find it particularly dramatic. \u201cOnce, a few years ago, some Sri Lankans jumped overboard from a boat going past,\u201d Dave, the bartender at the island\u2019s community club, recalled. \u201cI think there were about four or five, and they showed up at Jack O\u2019Donnell\u2019s doorstep and knocked at the door. They couldn\u2019t speak English. Jack called the cops.\u201d That was 2011, when the rate of boat arrivals to Australia was peaking, and asylum seekers began to realise they didn\u2019t have to go as far as Christmas Island, about 800 km to the east, to reach Australian territory.  The first wave caught the Australian government unawares. Dave and the bar manager, Maxine, were forced to house nearly 200 asylum seekers in the community club. \u201cWe fed them, Maxine and I, we had to go and get food and everything and cook for them and feed them, until they could get customs here,\u201d he said. The locals bristled at the loss of their drinking hole. \u201cWe had an hour each day where people could get takeaways,\u201d Dave said. The Cocos Islands is a tiny green speck in the Indian ocean nearer to Penang than Perth, settled in 1826 as a resupply base for Indian ocean traders. Back then, South Asians were brought in by force. \u201cMy family shipped them in as indentured servants,\u201d a sixth-generation Cocos islander, John Clunies-Ross, said.  The laborers were mostly mixed Malays, and about 500 of their ancestors remain on Home island, the Cocos\u2019 northern landmass. Along with Clunies-Ross and the other residents of the West island, they voted in 1984 to become incorporated into Australia. It brought a wealthy government\u2019s investment in the island, but the high dollar and wage standards wiped out the island\u2019s coconut industry. &quot;So immediately you had 90% unemployment, and since then everyone has just been on the dole,\u201d Clunies-Ross said. But for the Australian government, the island is worth the cost. As Clunies-Ross puts it: \u201cThis is a cheap aircraft carrier in a strategic area.\u201d In the second world war, Mosquitos, Spitfires and Liberator bombers stationed on the island flew sorties into Malaysia and Singapore. Australia\u2019s first naval victory took place off its shores in 1914 when the HMAS Sydney sank a German cruiser, SMS Emden, that had been terrorising trading ships in the Indian ocean. On Sunday, the Australian government tried to use the island as a secret base to fly asylum seekers to the mainland. During Sunday\u2019s operation, the West island\u2019s population of around 120 nearly doubled. Police were posted up and down its only road. Serco staff congregated around the airport. Customs officials milled around the wharf and the enormous Ocean Protector was moored in its lagoon.     The more idyllic side of the Cocos Islands.

The locals, living once again in the shadow of Australia\u2019s harsh immigration regime, just did their best to forget about it.  \u201cThere\u2019s one thing we don\u2019t talk about, to locals or tourists,\u201d Michelle, a six-year resident of the island, said at the bar. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about refugees.

Across the greater East Asian hemisphere in particular, transformation is occurring at an astounding scale. Hundreds of millions have entered the middle class and continue to achieve tremendous wealth on the back of targeted policy reform and broad economic liberalisation measures. Despite these advances many millions more \u2013 particularly women, rural communities and ethnic minority groups \u2013 remain in poverty, and it is those living at the fringes who remain the priority of Australia&apos;s aid efforts. It is fitting, therefore, that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade&apos;s (DFAT) paradigm shift toward empowering the private sector, mainstreaming inclusive development and, ultimately, helping recipient nations transform into sustainable economies seeks to marry some of these principles. Of all the talking points to emerge from DFAT&apos;s June aid policy announcement one of the more interesting was the call to engage creative thinkers from inside and outside the public sector \u2013 whether from Australia or offshore \u2013 to find better ways to deliver on these aspirations. The government&apos;s commitment of AU$140m for the trialing and testing of different development initiatives through an internal Innovation Hub is bold and encouraging, while the ongoing commitment to research for development (through the Australian Centre of International Agricultural Research and other key bodies) further affirms this commitment to producing best practice aid. On global terms one could argue that this isn&apos;t necessarily a new approach \u2013 USAID&apos;s new Global Development Lab is a significant and novel approach to incubating and scaling innovations in the development space. DFID too is promoting innovation. Even the Paris Declaration of 2005 went a long way toward recognising the need for systemic innovation to improve effectiveness. But innovation doesn&apos;t have to be doing something that is new. Applying an approach to a new context (or to a realigned aid program in Australia&apos;s case) is innovation too. The difference here is that DFAT is uniquely positioned to embrace learnings from Asia itself and to integrate them into its aid programming. Some stand out tenets come to mind that DFAT might take into account to make a real impact through learning and innovation: A two-way streetWhile some Asian countries are still recipients of Australian aid, outward aid flows from Asia are not well understood and remain under-researched by a global aid community still focused on the OECD-centric approach. For example China and India&apos;s development assistance programs are taking off in a big way, yet little is really understood of their scale, priorities and effectiveness. Not only are there potential insights and learnings to be shared, but duplicating their work in fields from infrastructure financing through to small-scale business loans would clearly be a step in the wrong direction. It is essential that we understand the objectives and impacts of these programs, and ensure cross-agency coordination. Selecting private-sector entry pointsPrivate sector development can be an ambiguous term for some but many policy practitioners in Asia would associate it with tenets of nation-building (eg enhancing industry competitiveness, infrastructure development, facilitating cross-border trade). Australia&apos;s new aid policy advocates these types of undertakings which are typically large-scale and can be risky. The aid program might do better to focus on a smaller number of flagship activities and ensure their success and learnings are properly accounted for. The importance of governmentWhile the private sector has been a champion of change in many Asian societies, effective and accountable government remains central to nation building (especially in countries who remain large recipients of Australian aid) and there are lessons for learning. Take Singapore \u2013 on fronts of infrastructure planning and financing, meritocratic employment methods and incorruptibility it is among the best performing public sectors in the world. A careful balance should be struck between DFAT&apos;s increased work with the private sector and the unavoidable need to continue strengthening government institutions in partner countries to achieve outcomes. Playing the long gameAsia&apos;s &apos;miracle&apos; stories are not based on silver bullets or overnight success. Japan&apos;s export driven growth model of the 20th century was a 40-year venture; Korea&apos;s Chaebol-led transformation from ODA-recipient to industrial powerhouse came despite great scarcity of natural resources; the shift of the Tiger economies into advanced, value-added production continues to create jobs and raise incomes across the region \u2013 but such changes occur over the space of a generation. Similarly, the Australian government must be patient in seeing the fruits of it labour from this new aid paradigm, especially if it seeks to harness the power of the private sector. Asia is rich with innovation in its approach to harnessing the private sector to create change and achieve prosperity. DFAT&apos;s innovation hub has the potential to be a global leader in testing, adopting and rolling out some of these fundamental principles across the Indo-Pacific and leveraging learnings from its very own neighbourhood.

But at the centre of the investigation is a familiar story: the life and career of his 42-year-old son Zhou Bin, a wealthy investor whose ascent seems to embody the tight relationship between money and power at the top of the party elite. On Tuesday, the Chinese independent magazine Caijing reported that Zhou has been formally arrested for &quot;involvement in illegal business operations&quot; by the procuratorate in Yichang, a prefecture-level city in eastern China&apos;s Hubei province. Authorities had detained the younger Zhou as he was leaving Singapore for the US in December, according to Reuters, the South China Morning Post and others. While initial accounts claimed that Zhou was simply aiding the investigation into his father, a raft of brazen state media reports this spring suggested that he was under investigation himself. Zhou was born in 1972, as his father \u2013 the head of China&apos;s domestic security until he retired in 2012 \u2013 was beginning to build a career in the country&apos;s state-owned oil industry. He moved to Texas in 1993 to attend university; there, he met his wife, Huang Wan, 42, who also has a family background in oil. They relocated to Beijing in 2000 and, until last year, occupied a multimillion-pound villa in the city&apos;s north-eastern suburbs. Zhou Jr reportedly owns property in California, New Jersey and Texas. Although his holdings range from hydropower to real estate, most of his companies produce equipment for the oil industry, the core of his father&apos;s power base. China&apos;s anti-corruption authorities detained scores of the elder Zhou&apos;s family members over the past year, as they expanded their inquiries. According to a New York Times investigation in April, authorities targeted Zhou&apos;s &quot;wife, a son, a brother, a sister-in-law, a daughter-in-law and the son&apos;s father-in-law,&quot; all of whom had apparently used Zhou&apos;s political clout for financial gain. Although Zhou Bin appears less severe than his perennially unsmiling father \u2013 he wears wire-framed glasses and coiffed hair \u2013 he &quot;often acted as if the security apparatus commanded by his father was available for his personal use,&quot; anonymous sources told the Financial Times last autumn. Zhou is not the only family member of a top government official to strike it rich \u2013 in 2012, Bloomberg found that current president Xi Jinping&apos;s family amassed millions of dollars in assets; a New York Times expose concluded that former premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s family had \u00a31.68bn. Yet Zhou Bin&apos;s case was unique for the vim with which Chinese media reported it, reflecting a high-level campaign to discredit his family. In March, the state-run Beijing News linked him to a major public housing scandal. The independent magazine Caixin explored his business dealings with a Sichuanese mafia boss. According to an expos\u00e9 in the Beijing News, Zhou acquired the rights to a neighborhood renovation project through his university roommate, Mi Xiaodong; he then &quot;transferred the project to professional real estate companies for profit&quot;. Graft investigators detained Mi in October. Caixin looked into Zhou&apos;s alleged connections to Liu Han, a Sichuan mining tycoon and &quot;mafia style&quot; gang leader, charged late last month with murder. Liu purchased tourism assets from Zhou at inflated prices more than a decade ago to win his favour, the magazine reported."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/29/qatar-punishing-price-progress-migrants", "sentences": ["Myriad construction companies have sprung up in recent years, sown by entrepreneurs from Lebanon, Syria, India and Singapore, fertilised by a gush of contracts."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-29T17:50:20Z", "title": "Qatar: migrants bear the brunt of price of progress", "tags": ["Qatar", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Nepal"], "article": "For Tariq, a Bangladeshi taxi driver plying Doha&apos;s skyscraper-lined boulevards, the situation is simple: &quot;It is a bubble. What they are building is not real. And we are modern slaves.&quot; It is a common view of the Gulf emirate and contains some truth, but the reality is more complex. No bigger than Yorkshire, this thumb-shaped peninsula on the east coast of Saudi Arabia has already attracted around 1.4 million migrant workers with its gas and petroleum wealth. So many Nepalese have come (about 400,000) that there is reportedly a shortage of builders in Kathmandu. Migrants already outnumber Qataris by five to one and in 2012, when there was an active labour force of 1.3 million people, a mere 85,000 were locals. In the next two years, as Qatar spends $200bn (\u00a3119bn) (\u00a3120bn) on infrastructure before the 2022 World Cup, the country will build accommodation to house 220,000 more foreign workers. But Tariq&apos;s &quot;modern slaves&quot; come for a reason. Wages are higher than at home, encouraging poor workers to sacrifice their liberty and family lives to work six or seven days a week to fund education, better housing and healthcare for loved ones. About $15bn is sent home from Qatar every year and the sum is rising, part of a fast-growing global remittance economy from migrant labour that organisations including the World Bank see as capable of transforming developing countries. Qatar&apos;s ruling royal family has driven this migration policy to fuel its &quot;national vision&quot; to &quot;transform Qatar into an advanced country&quot;. It needs the migrants to achieve its drive, unprecedented in its speed and scale, to build new cities, vast art galleries, universities, hospitals, plus the world&apos;s biggest construction project, an entire national railway, from scratch. But the profound problems being experienced by huge numbers of workers are evidence that Qatar is simply trying to go too fast. All the main problems workers face should be avoidable in any &quot;advanced country&quot;: failure to pay workers, construction site accidents, squalid accommodation, draconian regulations that prevent workers moving jobs or leaving the country. Qatar&apos;s ruling elite appears to have lost control of these issues and it is not only because of its extraordinary appetite for new buildings and infrastructure. Although autocratic in many areas, in construction, the emir has allowed a freewheeling economy. Myriad construction companies have sprung up in recent years, sown by entrepreneurs from Lebanon, Syria, India and Singapore, fertilised by a gush of contracts. The infrastructure to police their behaviour has not kept up \u2013 whether health and safety inspectors or labour court officials to deal with disputes. As a result, some say the Qatari state has been reduced to providing services to these companies in the form of visas and permits rather than being able to control them. The influence of the Qatari business community, which has intricate connections with the ruling elite, also means any attempt at radical reform of the labour system runs into a web of vested interests concerned about added costs. Qatari businessmen might be fabulously rich as a result of the gas boom, but they drive a hard bargain. Qatar knows it must act. Earlier this month Abdulla al-Khulaifi, the labour minister, said: &quot;We welcome the recent scrutiny as it helps us identify shortcomings. We know there is much more to do, but we are making definite progress.&quot; He cited new regulations on prompt payment, better accommodation and a small increase in labour inspectors. But it is hard not to conclude that Qatar has bitten off more than it can chew. It is feeling the consequences in terms of damage to its international reputation. That can be repaired. The brunt of the pain will continue to be felt by the poor workers like Tariq and his countrymen toiling on sweltering building sites in exchange for the hope of a better life one day back home."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jul/30/russia-sanction-tension-gazprom-gas-role-britain", "sentences": ["He said the relatively low tax figure of \u00a320m reflected the fact that much of the profit was earned abroad, often in places like Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-30T14:48:08Z", "title": "Russia sanction tension highlights Gazprom's growing role in Britain", "tags": ["Gazprom", "Gas", "Business", "Energy industry", "Commodities", "Russia", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "The tension over Russia has highlighted the growing role Gazprom plays in Britain. The state-owned Russian energy giant is the fourth biggest provider of gas to UK businesses and supplies a roster of blue-chip organisations including the National Health Service, Oxford University and Chelsea football club. It has also made an office near Regent&apos;s Park in London its global headquarters for energy trading, with up to 600 staff employed in the capital and more joining every day. A UK-registered subsidiary, Gazprom Marketing and Trading (GM&amp;T), produced a net income of \u00a3374m in 2012, and paid dividends to its owner of over \u00a3100m. In the same year it handed over little more than \u00a320m in UK corporation tax, according to the last annual accounts filed at Companies House. GM&amp;T&apos;s Gazprom Energy arm, based in Manchester, provides 10% of gas used by businesses and boasts a customer base of 11,000. Gazprom has a long connection with Centrica. The Russian giant considered a \u00a310bn takeover of Centrica in 2006 but backed off amid a political storm in Westminster about the wisdom of selling off the country&apos;s biggest domestic energy supplier to Russia. The gas group had just a few months earlier cut off gas to the Ukraine in what Vladimir Putin claimed was a row over non-payment but was interpreted elsewhere as an attempt to stop Kiev building closer links with the west. Gazprom similarly turned off the taps in 2009 and again earlier this month over the same issue, but relations between the Kremlin and both Washington and Brussels have really deteriorated since pro-Russian rebels took control of eastern Ukraine. The annual accounts of GM&amp;T make clear that although it is based in the UK its strategic direction is set in Moscow. &quot;The Group (GM&amp;T) continues to position itself as a crucial interface for the wider Gazprom group. It (GM&amp;T) remains closely aligned with the strategic goals of the Gazprom group, which in turn fully supports the Group (GM&amp;T) in its own ambitions,&quot; it says. A spokesman for Gazprom said the trading arm had been established at Triton Street because the UK had a large pool of experienced people, a useful timezone for trading in Europe, America and Asia plus good airports for international travel. He said the relatively low tax figure of \u00a320m reflected the fact that much of the profit was earned abroad, often in places like Singapore. He added: &quot;The HMRC (Her Majesty&apos;s Revenue and Customs) are happy with this arrangement.&quot; Gazprom was not able to say exactly how much gas comes from Russia to the UK but some estimates have put it at 8bn cubic metres \u2013 which would make it more than a 10th of the national consumption. Greenpeace, which monitors Russian energy companies largely because of their activities in the Arctic, believes the figure could be as high as 12bn cubic metres. The Gazprom spokesman said he didn&apos;t recognise either figure but added it was possible these numbers reflected the total amount of gas formally traded through GM&amp;T in London. Gazprom&apos;s retail operations in the UK began in 2006 when the Russian giant acquired a small energy firm based in Cheshire, in the north-west of England, called Pennine Natural Gas. At the time the gas distribution business employed just 12 people and supplied a handful of clients. But it was quickely re-branded and has since become a major player in the UK&apos;s commercial gas market, operating from impressive steel and glass offices in the commercial heart of Manchester, employing around 250 staff and increasing the volume of its gas sales in the UK by 500%. Gazprom&apos;s initial foray into the UK market did not go entirely unnoticed. As far back as 2007 Tory MPs were expressing concern about its stated ambition to become a major supplier of energy to the NHS. One member of the Public Accounts Committee, Richard Bacon, asked at the time: &quot;When you have sick patients \u2026 can you really trust Vladimir Putin to be their major supplier?&quot; But fast forward seven years and it seems those warnings have not been heeded. As David Cameron called for tougher sanctions against Putin&apos;s administration last week, Gazprom Energy was quietly supplying gas to a range of high-profile customers \u2013 including a number of hospital trusts. The company declined to divulge details but the NHS confirmed Gazprom Energy supplies several trusts in north-west England in contracts worth \u00a312m. But its NHS operations are just one element of Gazprom Energy&apos;s spectacular growth. Its business customers across the UK range from local authorities to cinema chains, universities to high street shops and schools. Surveying this growing empire, the company&apos;s new global head of retail, Lars Clausen, told its quarterly magazine Energise his aim was to turn Gazprom Energy into &quot;the pan-European leader&quot; in its field. &quot;There are great opportunities; we can learn from what we&apos;ve done well in the UK and bring that to Europe.&quot; One of the things competitors say the company has done well in the UK is use its financial muscle to undercut their rivals on price. But a spokesman said its success was based on &quot;offering sophisticated and bespoke energy solutions to corporate clients&quot; rather than simply cut-price gas. He added: &quot;Gazprom Energy offers its clients flexibility, tailored to their specific business needs. It&apos;s not about [the] lowest rate and never has been \u2013 it&apos;s about designing an energy plan that meets the needs of the client at a good value for money.&quot; The Greenpeace UK energy campaigner Louise Hutchins said it was time to end a system where Cameron talked tough about slapping sanctions on Russia while presiding over an energy system that ploughs millions into the Kremlin&apos;s coffers. &quot;Every time ministers have scrapped funds for domestic clean technologies and failed to cut energy waste, they&apos;ve made Putin&apos;s oligarchs a bit richer and Britain&apos;s energy security a bit weaker. &quot;This is the price we pay for our addiction to fossil fuels, along with climate change, air pollution, and volatile energy prices. If ministers are serious about bulking up our energy security then the cheapest, easiest, fastest way to achieve this is cutting waste and backing clean, home-grown, high-tech power sources.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/31/privatisation-dogma-labour-us-military-singapore", "sentences": ["The most dramatic example, however, is Singapore.", "State-owned enterprises produce 22% of Singapore\u2019s national output, operating in a whole range of industries \u2013 not just the \u201cusual suspects\u201d of airline, telecommunications and electricity, but also semiconductors, engineering and shipping; and its housing and development board supplies 85% of the country\u2019s homes."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-31T17:23:00Z", "title": "To fight Britain\u2019s privatisation dogma, Labour needs help from the US military | Ha-Joon Chang", "tags": ["Privatisation", "Business", "Economic policy", "UK news", "Politics", "Labour", "US news", "Singapore", "World news"], "article": "Since Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 the UK has led the world in privatisation. The Conservative government sold off state-owned enterprises throughout the 1980s and the 1990s \u2013 electricity, oil, gas, rail, airline, airports, telecommunications, water, steel, coal, you name it. In the worldwide fever for selling off state assets that gripped those decades, the rest of the world looked up to Britain as the guiding example. Privatisation was halted under Labour. However, the belief in the superiority of the private sector was such that, when it brought the rail infrastructure back under state control in 2002 following a series of rail disasters, Labour made sure it did not take the form of re-nationalisation \u2013 at least in legal terms. Network Rail, the owner and operator of the rail infrastructure, was set up as a private company, although on a not-for-profit basis and without shareholders. When the coalition came to power in 2010, it resumed the privatisation drive with gusto. It privatised Royal Mail \u2013 the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d that even Thatcher balked at selling. However, in recent months the tide has started to turn, albeit slowly. Even while planning to sell off almost every remaining state-owned enterprise, from plasma supply to helicopter search and rescue, the coalition has had to make an embarrassing climbdown over its plan to privatise student loans. More importantly, in the past few months the Royal Mail sell-off has been fiercely criticised. Moya Greene, its chief executive, has questioned the viability of its universal service obligation. Abandoning this would mean that customers who live in less accessible or sparsely populated \u2013 and thus less profitable \u2013 areas wouldn\u2019t get their letters delivered, or would have to pay more for them: the end of the postal service as we know it. In the meantime, the Labour party has made the lack of competition and the suspected collusion in the privatised energy industry a key issue in its promise to \u201cfix broken markets\u201d, and has caught voters\u2019 attention by announcing its intention to partially reverse rail privatisation. Although its fear of being branded anti-business has prevented it from proposing outright renationalisation of the railways \u2013 despite the support for such a move from most of the electorate \u2013 it has declared that if it wins the 2015 general election it will \u201creverse the presumption against the public sector\u201d, and let state operators bid for rail franchises. However, if it is really to overturn the privatisation dogma, Labour should do more than reverse the presumption against the public sector: it should tell people that the public sector is often more efficient than the private sector. Even while there are many examples of inefficient state enterprises from all over the world, including the UK, there have been many successful such businesses throughout the history of capitalism. In the early days of their industrialisation, 19th-century Germany and Japan set up state-run \u201cmodel factories\u201d in order to kickstart new industries such as steel and shipbuilding, which the private sector considered too risky to invest in. For half a century after the second world war, several European countries used state businesses to develop technologically advanced industries: France is the best-known example, with household names like Thomson (now Thales), Alcatel, Renault and Saint-Gobain. Austria, Finland and Norway also had technologically dynamic state-run enterprises. The most dramatic example, however, is Singapore. The country is usually known for its free trade policy and welcoming attitude towards foreign investments, but it has the most heavily state-owned economy, except for some oil states. State-owned enterprises produce 22% of Singapore\u2019s national output, operating in a whole range of industries \u2013 not just the \u201cusual suspects\u201d of airline, telecommunications and electricity, but also semiconductors, engineering and shipping; and its housing and development board supplies 85% of the country\u2019s homes. Taiwan, another east Asian \u201cmiracle\u201d economy, also has a very large state-run sector, accounting for 16% of national output. Posco, the state-owned steel company in my native South Korea, was initially set up against World Bank advice but is now one of the biggest steel companies in the world. (It was privatised in 2001, but for political reasons rather than poor performance.) In Brazil, Embraer \u2013 the third largest civilian aircraft manufacturer in the world \u2013 was initially developed under state control; and the country\u2019s state-owned oil company, Petrobras, is the world leader in deep-sea drilling. Arguably the most successful state enterprise in human history, however, is the United States military, which has almost single-handedly established the modern information economy. The development of the computer was initially funded by the US army; the country\u2019s navy financed the research that created the semiconductor; and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency developed the Arpanet, the precursor of the internet. When people realise that the history of capitalism is full of highly successful state enterprises, the rush for ever more privatisation can be halted. If the Labour party puts forward this case, it will not only gain popularity in the run-up to next year\u2019s general election \u2013 it would also be doing something of lasting benefit for Britain."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/01/tech-city-broadband-startups-bt", "sentences": ["\u00a33,000 voucher scheme is a money-maker for BT A new superfast broadband voucher scheme offers startups \u00a33,000 to help with installation costs - an idea initiated after a senior MP visited Singapore, which has unrivalled speeds and access nationwide."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-01T09:47:16Z", "title": "Tech City: world-class startups deserve world-class broadband", "tags": ["Technology startups", "Technology", "Silicon Roundabout", "Broadband", "Broadband", "BT", "Internet", "Telecommunications industry"], "article": "Until April, I worked at Tech City UK building new partnerships for the government within the tech sector, and helping to grow the east London tech cluster. It was fantastic to see the energy and growth emerging in this new wave of UK tech, especially given the country\u2019s legacy in this space. Working with startups and trying to understand how to help them grow, it became apparent that poor infrastructure was stifling their creativity and growth. There was no lack of ideas, or ability to raise money.  But accessing good broadband was a constant complaint, and, for some time, there was no access to fibre services at all. Several of the most promising companies listed in Tech City\u2019s Future Fifty list struggled with the time it took to get new lines installed or existing lines transferred, and even with our ability to speak directly to the internet service providers (ISPs) we found it very difficult to help make this any quicker. A typical wait for a domestic, consumer broadband connection is a maximum of about three weeks. Moving a broadband line to a new address can take as long, and even after giving fair notice of moving dates, which means companies can be without a valid connection in their new premises for several months after they have moved in.  BT provides the infrastructure for broadband resellers, and it quotes very quick installation times once the order gets to them. The problem appears to be the red tape between BT and the resellers. For small businesses these can be damaging delays as resellers negotiate with landlords to get access for installation. But there doesn\u2019t seem to be any template or established process, meaning each case is dealt with individually and can take months to resolve. In my last day at Tech City, we gathered some key figures from the ISP community to raise this subject yet again. ISPs were keen to stress that their own part of the process is being delivered to the best of their ability and within their own targets, and also say that the UK\u2019s overall coverage is comparable with the most advanced countries in the world. What we need is for Ofcom to look at the complete ecosystem from ordering to delivery and moving lines, both for consumer and business lines. Broadband needs to be installed along with other basic infrastructure - water and electricity - and not an afterthought. \u00a33,000 voucher scheme is a money-maker for BT A new superfast broadband voucher scheme offers startups \u00a33,000 to help with installation costs - an idea initiated after a senior MP visited Singapore, which has unrivalled speeds and access nationwide.  The aim was to help drive take-up, yet the voucher can only be redeemed against the set-up costs for a business broadband package. That often means a leased line contract with sizeable ongoing costs that can outweigh the setup fees.  If an SME is to commit to this package it needs a business plan that justifies these ongoing costs, which means many small firms will chose cheaper consumer lines. The voucher is not encouraging new connections, but discounting existing connections. In the City of London \u2013 one of the boroughs to launch the scheme \u2013 there was almost zero uptake when it launched. The scheme is being marketed heavily by the government, which is trying to push SMEs from consumer lines to more expensive business lines, in effect putting more dollars into BT\u2019s pockets. I don\u2019t believe that was the original intention.  BT could argue that there are many other companies in this market and they should share the burden of solving this problem. Yet BT is still biggest player, and still owns and maintain much of the copper below the streets. It is also the UK\u2019s oldest telecoms company and should be leading this discussion.  Not just a business broadband issue Nick D\u2019Aloisio sold his business to Yahoo in 2013 for $30m. Nick started learning how to build apps at the age of 12, was 15 when he took his first investment and just 17 when he sold Summly, his company. He did the majority of the work from his home, and not an office. The government is trying to support the growth of the UK technology industry and encourage more people with ideas to make them a reality. The inspiration that leads to building a tech business comes from unrivalled access to the internet which provides everyone with a clear route to learning, research and facilities like cloud computing.  We should stop investing in voucher schemes and concentrate on solving the complex issues around landlords, access and installation - not just for businesses, but for consumers too. If the UK wants to be the most attractive place in the world to setup a technology business then it should be the best in the world for broadband speeds, access and service.

Safe segregation in S\u00e3o Paulo? Sexual assualt against women on public transport has become a serious problem in Brazil. As the sustainable transport and urban development network Embarq explains, a recent survey suggests 65% of Brazilians believe that \u201cwomen who wear clothes that show off their body deserve to be attacked\u201d. In response to these concerns, a law has been passed in S\u00e3o Paulo that requires its metro system to create women-only carriages to protect their safety on public transport. A similar development happened in Rio de Janeiro in 2006, but the practice was not consistently enforced. Some women in S\u00e3o Paulo oppose the law, believing that segregation is not the answer and that women should be free to feel safe in public. \u201cDeixe as mulheres livres, N\u00e3o ao vag\u00e3o rosa,\u201d their stickers announce on the walls of metro carriages: \u201cLet women be free, No to the pink train.\u201d The early bird gets the free ride Less contentious public transport changes are also afoot. Toronto mayoral candidate David Soknacki recently suggested making public transport in the city free to anyone traveling before rush hour, in order to ease overcrowding. It sounds like an attractive idea \u2013 and as CityLab reports, a similar programme has already been successful in Singapore. Singapore\u2019s transport authority has run a pre-peak free transport initiative for just over a year on their MRT subway system, regulating passengers throughout the morning. But for those wishing to repeat Singapore\u2019s success with similar initiatives, the real challenge is funding. Putting the \u2018park\u2019 in car park Copenhagen is well-known for transforming its busy streets into pedestrian zones, but now multistorey car parks are being claimed as public spaces, too. It seems these typical eyesores are becoming the new focus of urban innovations: a project in the US sees them as perfect locations for affordable housing.  When a new multistorey car park was proposed for Copenhagen, it was decided that its roof should be made into a neighbourhood park and playground. What\u2019s more, a plant \u201cshelving system\u201d greens the building\u2019s external walls, making the structure more environmentally friendly and easier on the eye. But for a city so pedestrian-focused, should Copenhagen be building a large car park in the first place?  Love rats If you visit the Louvre Museum in Paris this year, you may get a nasty surprise. The gardens surrounding the city\u2019s famous art haven are suffering from a particularly bad infestation of rats. Rather than being shocked and repelled, many tourists are warming to the creatures in what has been called the \u201cRatatouille effect\u201d. As CityLab reports: \u201cPublic perceptions of Parisian rats have become softened thanks to Disney\u2019s animated portrayal of their culinary skills. It seems that visitors just aren\u2019t scared enough of them anymore.\u201d Times Square is one big computer Little over 100 years ago, Times Square was not Times Square as we know it. In fact, it was called Longacre Square, before a rebranding by the New York Times in 1904 set it on its way to stardom. Glittering advertising now defines the famous spot: as Gizmodo explains, the signs are so central to the area\u2019s identity that there is actually a zoning code that requires all buildings on that stretch of Broadway to have at least one sign of a certain size. Many of these are now digital, of course. Fifty-five of Times Square\u2019s 230 billboards are giant LED displays. As even the engineers admit, with the Square so reliant on module technology, it\u2019s just one big computer. Albeit a computer that costs over $300m (\u00a3178m) a year in water, electricity and greenhouse gas emissions to run.

The two routes comprise nearly 1,400km in total but unlike many other high-speed trains, which generally run at a speed of 200 km per hour, will only be able to run at 160 km per hour until further investment would allow a higher-speed system.     Map of the planned route     Chinese officials involved in the project have described the deal as a major scoop for the Chinese government, which had earlier struck a deal with former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra \u2014 only to see the project initially rejected by the junta when it came to power. Now the military government has approved the project, &quot;there will be huge room for cooperation [between China and Thailand],&quot; Yang Yong of the China Railway Corp told China Daily, adding that Chinese engineers had been involved in feasibility research for the high-speed lines, and Chinese companies were directly helping to modernise Thailand&apos;s railway system. The effect of high-speed rail is likely to change South-east Asia and the way it does business for good, says Geoff Wade of the College of Asia and the Pacific at the Australian National University. &quot;When the people of the mainland countries soon find, through the convenience of [high-speed railways], that Kunming is their &apos;closest neighbour&apos; but a few hours away, the Yunnan capital will gradually emerge as the hub of the Greater Mekong Region and will eventually become, in effect, the capital of mainland Southeast Asia,&quot; Wade wrote on the Australian Strategic Policy Institute Blog."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2014/aug/01/royal-mail-shares-fall-reason", "sentences": ["The emerging markets bank warned last month of a fall of about 20% in operating profits caused by weak markets in India, Korea and Singapore plus a jump in bad loans by &quot;a high-teens percentage&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-01T20:45:42Z", "title": "Rivals' unfair advantage contributes to Royal Mail shares plunge", "tags": ["Royal Mail", "Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Banking reform", "Financial sector", "Business"], "article": "How are those super, soaraway Royal Mail shares doing? Not so soaraway. Priced at 330p at flotation, the stock hit 600p in January but touched 415p this week, the lowest they have traded. The market has had a serious rethink about prospects. This does not mean business secretary Vince Cable was right all along about the Royal Mail&apos;s valuation. The silliness of privatisation lay in the sale of 60% of the shares in one go. It would have been much better to sell in stages: slip out 20% initially and allow the market, rather than ministers and civil servants led by City advisers, to assess the right price. That argument can be put on the shelf until Lord Myners offers a view in his report on privatisations in the autumn. The question now is why Royal Mail&apos;s shares are falling so rapidly. Three reasons are obvious. Competition has stiffened in the parcels market across Europe; Amazon in Britain is delivering more of its parcels itself; and Royal Mail&apos;s GLS operation in France is one of several companies suspected of anti-competitive practices. All could be filed under everyday thrills and spills. A fourth factor should concern everybody, not only shareholders. It is the seemingly haphazard way in which competition is being injected into the UK letter delivery business, especially the end-to-end market where new entrants can use their own postmen to cover &quot;the final mile&quot;. &quot;Direct delivery is in reality not level playing field competition that brings benefits to consumers,&quot; complains Royal Mail. &quot;Rather it is &apos;cherry picking&apos; arbitrage.&quot; That is a self-interested view but it is persuasive. Royal Mail&apos;s obligation to deliver to every address in Britain six days a week at a uniform price \u2013 the Universal Service Obligation, or USO \u2013 relies on cross-subsidies. The lucrative bits, such as serving densely populated cities, subsidise deliveries to rural areas. If rivals have a free hand to operate only in cities, and to deliver only pre-sorted utility bills and bank statements, the USO will become unstable at some point. Royal Mail has been a tizzy ever since TNT Post, which operates an every-other-day service, announced plans to cover 42% of UK addresses, but only 8.5% of the UK geography, by 2017. TNT postmen are already on the beat in London, Liverpool and Manchester. Ofcom, the postal regulator, points out that end-to-end letter competition was less than 1% of market volumes in March this year and that it will assess any &quot;emerging threat&quot; to the USO. Okay, but what&apos;s missing here is a clear vision of how many cherries it is safe to remove, and how quickly, in the interests of kicking Royal Mail to keep modernising. Royal Mail chief executive Moya Greene complains that without regulatory intervention she won&apos;t be able to achieve the 5%-10% profit margin deemed sufficient to protect the USO. She may be exaggerating \u2013 bosses of regulated utilities have form on that score. But her broad argument that cross-subsidies, once lost, are hard to restore seems correct. Ofcom should get on with its review now, not wait until the end of next year. Standard Chartered Standard Chartered has already told us that its first-half figures next Wednesday will be horrible. The emerging markets bank warned last month of a fall of about 20% in operating profits caused by weak markets in India, Korea and Singapore plus a jump in bad loans by &quot;a high-teens percentage&quot;. The share price also looks horrible. In March last year, when Standard was completing a decade of unbroken growth in revenues and profits, it was \u00a318. Now it is \u00a312.22, a price first seen as long ago as 2006. Naturally, some shareholders are asking how a bank that breezed through the financial crisis can take such a tumble in gentler climes. Emerging markets \u2013 or some of them \u2013 have weakened, but is this a case of management losing its grip? Did the $667m (\u00a3396m) penalty for breaching US sanctions on Iran throw the organisation into confusion? If so, should chairman Sir John Peace or chief executive Peter Sands let somebody else have a go? Fund managers&apos; muttering is undeniable but it is hard to make an overwhelming case for boardroom change at this point. Sands neglected to charm his investors during the glory years, leaving the job to now departed finance director Richard Meddings, but he has accumulated credit for Standard&apos;s 2007-2012 record. As for Peace, he got it plainly wrong on remuneration (there was a 40% shareholder rebellion at Standard&apos;s annual meeting) and needs to rectify the mistake of setting overly short-term targets, but it&apos;s not obvious that a change of chairman would improve operations on the ground. Sands and Peace are clearly determined to stay. Assuming no fresh surprises on Wednesday, they probably have a year to get the show back on the road. Banking ethics The best argument for making bankers swear an oath of good behaviour is the possibilities for entertainment. There could be an annual event, a bit like Trooping the Colour, with a regiment of Barclays forex traders marching behind a company of RBS small business consultants. The Bank of England governor would take a salute as the assembled workers give a mass chant of &quot;we promise to be nice&quot; and their bosses pledge to polish their tier-one capital ratios. The oath idea, promoted by think-tank ResPublica, is nonsense. Nobody would take such pledges seriously since good behaviour in banking is demonstrated by deeds, not pious declarations. The supposed golden age of gentlemanly bankers whose word was their bond was riddled with insider trading. In recent times cuddly old Co-op Bank traded on its claimed ethical superiority but still pumped out payment protection insurance with the rest of them. HSBC used to be terribly proud of its upright reputation but still forgot to erect money-laundering controls to prevent Mexican drug cartels laundering billions of dollars through its branches. Tougher regulation, better laws and more prosecutions are the way forward. A criminal offence of &quot;reckless banking&quot;, as proposed by regulators, would be a useful deterrent, whatever the practical difficulties of securing convictions. Oaths are flim-flam. Ideas for Tesco An idea for Dave Lewis, incoming boss of Tesco: study that BT sharesave scheme paying out an average of \u00a342,000 to participants and see if you can invent a souped-up version. These schemes only work so spectacularly as motivational tools when they start by catching a low in the share price. BT in 2009 was at an all-time low and the price has improved fivefold since then, which is why the payout numbers are so large. Tesco, even with a following wind, would struggle to double in value in five years, even from its shrunken share price of 253p. But perhaps shop-floor staff could be offered deeper discounts on their shares, or straightforward cash payments instead if profit targets are met. Something needs to happen to reverse the sense of drift."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/04/amir-khan-floyd-mayweather-manny-pacquiao-fight-boxing", "sentences": ["I was getting calls from America, Singapore, Pakistan, Asia, Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-04T11:49:38Z", "title": "Amir Khan: \u2018Fighting Mayweather like chess but Pacquiao would be harder\u2019", "tags": ["Amir Khan", "Boxing", "Floyd Mayweather", "Manny Pacquiao", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "My nose is a little bruised and bent but only I can tell how bad it is,\u201d Amir Khan says as he smiles ruefully when reminded that nine years ago this summer he made his debut as a professional boxer. Khan tweaks his fighter\u2019s nose gently as if he cannot believe how much he has endured since joining the paid ranks of this battered old business as an Olympic silver medallist and teenage sensation in July 2005. \u201cSo much has happened since then,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve come back from losses and won world titles. I\u2019ve boxed in the UK and America, won fight of the year and moved up three weight classes. I\u2019ve achieved so much and I\u2019m still only 27. But I feel fresh, which is amazing when you think of all the hard fights and hard training. I\u2019ve been boxing since I was eight and that\u2019s a long time to take punches day after day.\u201d Khan is engaging and eloquent and, like most boxers, he prefers a genuine conversation to a conventional question-and-answer routine. Being hit in the face also instils a rare candour in fighters like Khan. \u201cI\u2019m in a sport where one punch can change your life,\u201d he says intently at his gym in Bolton. \u201cI understand why my mum and my wife can\u2019t bear to watch me fight. There\u2019s a lot of blood, a lot of pain. I\u2019m a fighter but I find it very hard to watch my brother [Haroon \u2013 an unbeaten super-flyweight with a professional record of 5-0] because there\u2019s nothing you can do to help him. It must be hell for my mum.\u201d Khan considers the dark consequences of boxing with a light touch. \u201cI can still read and write,\u201d he quips, but it\u2019s fortunate that \u2013 as he displayed so effectively in his last contest \u2013 Khan has finally adopted a more clinical style. He took fewer blows than usual when outclassing the limited but experienced Luis Collazo in Las Vegas three months ago. Khan\u2019s features were swollen after 12 rounds but he knocked Collazo down three times and resisted the temptation to engage too heavily during his first bout at welterweight. Now, just after Ramadan, Khan is in a reflective mood. His skilful display against Collazo won him widespread plaudits but he has lost the chance to fight either Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao this year. He has also become a less attractive option for fighters who would prefer to face the Khan of old \u2013 a vulnerable, big-hitting gambler. \u201cThey enjoy that,\u201d he says of opponents as well as US television executives who have always loved Khan\u2019s tendency to produce rollicking entertainment before safety-first dexterity. \u201cI still gave them a great fight against Collazo but the days are gone when I\u2019d go in there, all guns blazing, and make mistakes. I have the skills to box and not get into a war. I\u2019ve been getting punishment I shouldn\u2019t be taking because, sometimes, I\u2019m too brave for my own good. When I\u2019ve got good footwork and movement I should use them.\u201d     Amir Khan connects with a right against Luis Collazo during their welterweight bout at the MGM Grand in May. Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images    Earlier this year, when Khan was convinced he would face Mayweather, the American decided to fight Marcos Maidana \u2013 the tough Argentinian whom Khan had defeated in 2010. It was expected to be another routine victory for \u201cMoney\u201d Mayweather but Maidana startled everyone. After he had dispatched Collazo on the same bill at the MGM Grand, Khan says he \u201cstayed in the backroom and watched the fight on TV. \u201cFor the first five rounds [in a fight Maidana initially dominated and hurt the normally evasive Mayweather] I was shocked. I\u2019d expected Mayweather to win easily but styles make fights. Maidana put so much pressure on him that Floyd didn\u2019t have room to throw his punches. You have problems with Maidana if you just stand and fight. Floyd won but it wasn\u2019t easy. If I had fought Floyd it might\u2019ve been a very different story because I\u2019m so much faster. It was a strange night because Mayweather just didn\u2019t look himself. Maybe time is catching up with him or he had personal issues.\u201d Does Khan believe the notoriously tricky Mayweather when he promises that they will eventually fight? \u201cI kind of do, but I don\u2019t,\u201d Khan sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one. I know he needs me to make the really big pay-per-view numbers and money motivates him. It drives him because he can make much more fighting me than Maidana. I\u2019m big in the UK, Dubai, Asia and places where Floyd\u2019s not as well known.\u201d Maidana has been given a rematch with Mayweather on 13 September and Khan remains on the outside looking in, striving to sound positive. \u201cFloyd had a tough fight last time and the rematch might be tough too. So it\u2019s working out just right. When we do fight I\u2019ll be so much fresher. I know Floyd [46-0] wants to reach the 50-fight mark and maybe his last one will be against me.\u201d     Floyd Mayweather Jr, left, was unconvincing in victory over Marcos Maidana and has granted a rematch. Photograph: John Gurzinski/AFP/Getty Images    Khan, meanwhile, had been trying to drum up interest in a fight against Pacquiao in November. It\u2019s an intriguing prospect because they once shared a trainer in Freddie Roach \u2013 but Pacquiao has since announced that he will box the unbeaten Chris Algieri instead. \u201cThe Manny fight can still happen at some point,\u201d Khan says. \u201cMy promoters, Golden Boy, and Bob Arum [Pacquiao\u2019s promoter] are about to start working together again. Me and Manny sparred a lot, and I often went with him to the Philippines, so it would make a great fight. I\u2019ve left it with my team and my adviser Al Haymon [who also works closely with Mayweather] and I told them: \u2018I like the Manny fight.\u2019 But we\u2019ve had no response. \u201cBoxing is all about timing and Manny and Floyd are getting older. Someone has to take their place. Mayweather would be a very technical fight, like a game of chess. But I think Manny would be harder. He\u2019s much more aggressive and it would be more intense. But with my trainer Virgil Hunter I\u2019m a much better and more defensive fighter.\u201d Khan sounds slightly forlorn when considering his dwindling options this year. \u201cThe Mayweather fight has gone for now,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe Manny fight too. So I\u2019ll be disappointed because who else is there to fight? It\u2019s very hard to get a top-10 guy but I want to keep busy.\u201d It looks likely that Khan will fight next in December \u2013 with either Robert Guerrero or Devon Alexander his probable opponent. The obvious solution would have been for Khan to meet Kell Brook, his undefeated Sheffield rival, who is now preparing for a defining contest in the US. Khan has often denigrated Brook, but he sounds impressed by his fellow Briton travelling to California to fight the IBF world welterweight champion Shawn Porter on 16 August. \u201cI respect that a lot. Not many fighters would go away from home against Porter and, if Kell wins, it would put him straight in the big time. It would then definitely make sense for me and Kell to fight. We saw what Froch and Groves did at Wembley with 80,000 fans. We can also do that. But it\u2019s a big step up against Porter. Is he ready? He\u2019s been fighting C-class guys and now he\u2019s in with an A-class fighter.\u201d Khan eventually needs one of Brook, Pacquiao or Mayweather but it\u2019s important he does not become embroiled in less dignified scraps. This interview, scheduled for early July, had to be postponed because, hours before our first meeting, Khan was accused of assault by two teenage boys in Bolton. The outcome was less sensational but Khan looks mortified when asked if he had been seriously concerned. \u201cYeah,\u201d he nods. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look good. It doesn\u2019t help my career and if I\u2019d been charged it could have affected me going back to America. So I was concerned even if it was a misunderstanding. I had the interview in the police station and the policeman said: \u2018Look, this is nothing much. You boys can just sit down and sort it out.\u2019 On the Friday evening [18 hours after the incident] I got a call from the officer saying they were thinking of dropping the charges. I said there must be closed-circuit cameras which would show I did nothing bad. The police said there were but they weren\u2019t switched on. That would have helped me big time.\u201d What actually happened? \u201cSome kids started throwing things at my car. I got out of the car and one of them pushed me. I pushed him back and he fell on the floor. That was about it. I was on my own and there were 20 of them. It was just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. So it was a huge relief the case got dropped. The boys have since apologised to me and said it was wrong. In my position people are always going to have a go at me but, even through I\u2019m a fighter, I don\u2019t want to be fighting out of the ring.\u201d It was Khan\u2019s latest brush with tabloid infamy and he still appears shaken. \u201cIt went all over the world. I was getting calls from America, Singapore, Pakistan, Asia, Dubai. I couldn\u2019t believe how big it went. It\u2019s the downside of being famous.\u201d Khan has had far happier moments since the Colloza fight \u2013 not least becoming a father to a little girl. He seems suitably besotted with his daughter and the fact that he has been able to spend the first few months of her life at home in Bolton rather than locked away in a training camp. \u201cIt\u2019s also been Ramadan and, while it\u2019s not easy, I enjoy the fasting. I\u2019ve done a lot of research and fasting is good for you. It\u2019s a sacrifice I enjoy, and my friends now understand my sacrifices as a fighter trying to make weight.\u201d He shudders and relives his hardest ordeal on the scales when, before his last fight in Britain, against Julio D\u00edaz 15 months ago \u201cI was 12 pounds over [the light-welterweight limit] the day before the weigh-in. During my training I\u2019d made sure I was rehydrating and eating small amounts and taking the protein shakes MaxiNutrition make for me. I was strong and fit but then I had to shift the weight.\u201d Khan explains the painful process in intricate detail as he starved and ran and sweated in a steaming hot bath. \u201cI made it but I was so weak. That showed me I had to move up a division and you saw how strong I was at welterweight.\u201d He has taken his hard licks and three painful losses in a nine-year career which has seen him win 29 of his 32 fights. There have been disappointments and worries and there are sure to be more letdowns before Khan gets in the ring with Mayweather but he sounds cheerful and undaunted. \u201cI\u2019m still fresh and I love the sport. It\u2019s addictive and I need to be careful I get out before too many fights. If I stay in fantastic condition and I\u2019ve got all this experience and my mind\u2019s still there I can fight until I\u2019m 30. But in another three years I\u2019ll think about calling it a day. I\u2019ve been doing it for a very long time and you can\u2019t keep on forever. I just want to make the most of the time I\u2019ve got left as a fighter.\u201d Amir Khan feeds his muscles with MaxiNutrition protein when training and competing #feedyourmuscles www.maxinutrition.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/aug/04/steve-kean-hit-brunei-dpmm-blackburn-rovers-reign", "sentences": ["Eleven days ago Kean presented the crown prince with the Singapore League Cup after DPMM\u2019s 2-0 victory over Tanjong Pagar United.", "Kean\u2019s team, who as the only professional club in Brunei have to play abroad, also top the Singapore League with eight matches remaining and are in the semi-finals of the Singapore Cup.", "No team in the history of the Singapore competition has ever won the treble.", "I believe with one or two older players in the side we would have stayed up in that second year.\u201d As Blackburn prepare to open their third season in the Championship at home to Cardiff City on Friday, their former manager will discuss a contract extension with DPMM during a three-week break in the Singapore League."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-04T15:14:59Z", "title": "Steve Kean a hit at Brunei DPMM after ill-fated Blackburn Rovers reign", "tags": ["Steve Kean", "Blackburn Rovers", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Turmoil, vilification and relegation at Blackburn Rovers have not left a permanent scar on Steve Kean. \u201cIt is beautiful here,\u201d says the 46-year-old, now head coach of Brunei Duli Pengiran Muda Mahkota. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had nothing but support from the fans and the owner.\u201d Contrasts are plentiful between life at Ewood Park and in the oil-rich sovereign state known as \u201cthe Abode of Peace\u201d but Kean has overseen the most striking of all: success. The Glaswegian still finds himself summoned to the home of a wealthy foreign football club owner 23 months after his acrimonious split from Rovers and Venky\u2019s, the Indian poultry company that bought Blackburn in 2010 with calamitous consequences. But today\u2019s journey also reflects his subsequent change in fortunes. Whereas it used to be a matter of overnight flights to Mumbai plus a minimum two-hour drive to meet Blackburn\u2019s owners in Pune, and straight back again to take training, Kean\u2019s current regime involves a fortnightly visit to the palace of Crown Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah, the former goalkeeper-turned-owner of DPMM who is next in line to become the Sultan of Brunei. Their discussions on how to turn the club into a serious force in south-east Asia are paying dividends. Eleven days ago Kean presented the crown prince with the Singapore League Cup after DPMM\u2019s 2-0 victory over Tanjong Pagar United. The celebrations were purposely restrained. Kean\u2019s team, who as the only professional club in Brunei have to play abroad, also top the Singapore League with eight matches remaining and are in the semi-finals of the Singapore Cup. DPMM have never won the championship before and lead reigning champions Tampines Rovers by just one point following Sunday\u2019s painful 2-2 draw at home to Hougang United, who equalised in the final seconds. No team in the history of the Singapore competition has ever won the treble. \u201cWe are a good team in a decent league,\u201d explains Kean. \u201cWe had 16,500 for our last home game, which isn\u2019t full capacity but if we win our next few games I think we\u2019ll get around 30,000. With each game our crowd has pushed up. The team finished eighth last year and didn\u2019t win anything so to have the League Cup won, be top of the league and in the semi-finals of the FA Cup shows it has been a fantastic working year. If we win the league we will qualify for Asia\u2019s version of the Champions League and that will allow us to play against teams from other emerging countries. It would be great for the club \u2013 it\u2019s not about me.\u201d Though of course, in terms of individual recovery and reputation, it is about Kean, who joined DPMM on a one-year contract in November having consciously taken a step back from football once his 21-month reign at Blackburn ended in September 2012. The Scot used contacts in Spain, Portugal and Belgium to study coaching sessions on the continent, with Belgium\u2019s promotion of young talent a particular source of fascination, but admits time out was necessary. \u201cThere was obviously pressure at Blackburn but I never realised how much it took out of me until it was gone,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the time I was dealing with it on a daily basis but it was only after about three weeks out of the job I realised that mentally I\u2019d had a hard couple of years and needed to get my head back together. I could have gone straight back in to a job again but I would have been fatigued. \u201cI spoke to the chairman at Millwall. The job was between me and Steve Lomas, but I didn\u2019t think it was right. I wanted to freshen up and to have more family time. I had the best of both worlds, watching sessions in Europe but also being able to get back to being a dad again. I\u2019d never been to a parents\u2019 meeting at school before last year. My son was deciding on his GCSEs and it was good to be around for that. Then I got a call asking me to speak to the crown prince.\u201d Blackburn supporters may begrudge Kean success elsewhere having understandably revolted as their club veered from steady Premier League concern to Championship basket case under Venky\u2019s. As the one visible sign of Rovers\u2019 new hierarchy, and the man ultimately responsible for the results that cost the club their top-flight status, Kean became the target for vitriolic abuse. He has no regrets over accepting the offer to replace Sam Allardyce, initially as caretaker manager, then manager until the end of the 2010-11 season, then manager on a permanent contract, nor is there any bitterness as he reflects on those turbulent days when tennis balls inscribed with \u201cKean out\u201d rained down at Ewood and security personnel were stationed next to his dug-out. \u201cI\u2019m from a place where you just get on with it,\u201d says Kean, referring to his upbringing in the east end of Glasgow. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it was a nice experience, I\u2019m not being blase about it, but it did not affect me one bit. I wasn\u2019t standing there shaking in my shoes. Of course I\u2019d rather the fans were behind me and the team but I knew I had the dressing room and that the squad was galvanised by what was happening. \u201cWe were losing games and losing players and the fans were looking for a spokesperson to explain things. Unfortunately for the manager, he is the only one who does a press conference every week. There is no press conference for owners or directors. I was sat in front of the cameras every week and very few questions were about football. They were about investment and they were speaking to the wrong person. That is a question for owners and directors.\u201d Kean is adamant he \u201cwon\u2019t have a go at the owners or the fans\u201d but, equally, he holds an unmistakable belief that things could have been different at Blackburn had Venky\u2019s not dispensed with a core of experienced, higher-paid players. \u201cIt is different for someone who has been promoted from within to someone outside who goes to meet the owners about a job and is able to discuss the way they want to take the club, their ideas, your ideas, the wage bill etc,\u201d he insists. \u201cI was just asked by [former chairman] John Williams to look after the team on Saturday, then it was for another two games, another three. The way the club was moving was already set, the budget was set and you are immersed in it by that point. \u201cDecisions were made above the manager. When owners decide to invest, or not to invest, it is their decision and all you can do as a manager is put out the best team you have from within the club. We lost Jason Roberts, who had scored when we stayed up on what was described as Survival Sunday at Wolves in the first year, Chris Samba, Ryan Nelson, Brett Emerton, Keith Andrews, Roque Santa Cruz, Benjani. I once added up their games in English league football and the total was over 1,500 games. It is very difficult to replace that experience. \u201cWe did bring in good young players like Grant Hanley and Jake Kean but to stay in one of the best leagues in the world with a young team in the second year was too difficult. We had the youngest average age team to play in the Premier League when we beat Manchester United at Old Trafford [in 2011] but it catches up with you. I believe with one or two older players in the side we would have stayed up in that second year.\u201d As Blackburn prepare to open their third season in the Championship at home to Cardiff City on Friday, their former manager will discuss a contract extension with DPMM during a three-week break in the Singapore League. \u201cI\u2019m not using this as a stepping stone,\u201d adds Kean. \u201cI enjoy being here and whether it\u2019s for one, five or 10 years I\u2019ll take it as it comes.

How, when and where did you start out? Brainient started out from a failure. About a year before I started Brainient, I founded an online TV channel called BrainTV \u2013 &quot;TV for smart people&quot;. After a year of building a production studio, hiring presenters, editors and producing a number of web shows, I realised we were never going to build a big enough audience to be able to actually make money. BrainTV failed, but there was a feature that was very popular \u2013 the ability to interact with the shows using various interactive features. So I decided to build a company all about interactive videos. It worked out quite well. What digital technologies and innovations have helped you to establish and grow your company? One of our unfair competitive advantages has been that our engineering team is located in Romania, which has enabled us to hire brilliant engineers much more cost effectively than in London. We wouldn&apos;t have been able to do it if not for the wonderful collaboration tools out there \u2013 everything from Skype to Hangouts, Trello and so on. The world isn&apos;t flat, but the internet is and that&apos;s helped us a lot. Are you a global company? And if so how have you been able to grow this side of your business?  We have customers that run campaigns in eight different markets, from Brazil to Singapore. We service all these clients from our two main offices in London and Bucharest, and have sales representatives or partners in many other locations. Startups today can be both global and local from day one, thanks to things like the App Store (anyone in the world can buy your app from day one) or Skype In (create a physical phone number in Singapore that forwards to your UK mobile). How and at what point did you begin to raise finance for the business? We raised a seed round (\u00a3473,000) in 2009 and a Series A (\u00a31.1m) in 2012. We raised the seed round when we knew we had product/market fit (had a product that the market wanted, for those uninitiated in startup slang) and raised the Series A when we were ready to scale our sales &amp; marketing team. Deciding when to raise capital for your business is a trick question that doesn&apos;t have a right or wrong answer. The best way to do it is to think in milestones, and always raise 30% more than what you think you need in order to reach the next milestone. What one piece of advice would you give to a home business or startup wanting to gain a foothold in your space? There&apos;s a wonderful speech Winston Churchill gave at a graduation speech in 1941, in the context of the second world war. He ended his speech with: &quot;Never give in, never give in, never, never, in nothing, great or small, large or petty. Never give in to nothing except to convictions of honour and good faith. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.&quot; So, I&apos;d say to never give in.

Brace yourself for Bozza-mania | Dave Hill", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "Politics", "Conservatives", "David Cameron", "London", "UK news", "Margaret Thatcher"], "article": "Boris Johnson\u2019s admission that he will \u201cin all probability\u201d seek to return to parliament at next year\u2019s general election comes as a relief after the endless months of speculation, but also triggers the start of the next unending orgy of media fascination about his plans for becoming leader of the Conservative party, leader of the country and, should the opportunity present itself, leader of the universe too. Not that this is irrelevant. Far from it. Whatever doubts voters may have about the suitability of \u201cgood old Boris\u201d for high national office, none should question his gargantuan ambition. A conviction Friedmanite, greed is his creed. His policy on cake, as he likes people to know, is to have it and eat it in large amounts. He is sticking to his pledge to complete his second term as London mayor, which is due to end in 2016. He\u2019s previously said that this role \u201ccannot be combined with any other political capacity\u201d, but there is no rule to prevent him being an MP at the same time (there is also precedent, as Ken Livingstone was an MP when elected mayor in 2000 and didn\u2019t vacate his seat for several months). The mayoralty will continue to provide a spotlit platform from which Johnson can espouse his political philosophies to audiences far beyond the capital. How afraid should we be of Johnson moving in stages from City Hall, home of the London mayoralty, to No 10? Look beyond his all-conquering personality, that clever, cultivated, half-satirical buffoonery, and discover an intellectual consistency unusual in Tory politicians. Johnson is both an economic and a social liberal. He\u2019s a free enterprise evangelist whose instinctive attitude to tighter regulation is to regard it as a lethal disease. Yet he has never carried on like those moral authoritarian Tories of the Thatcher years. He\u2019s for live and let live, just as long as minorities don\u2019t go around asking the taxpayer to fund their pursuit of grievances. He may be in no position to utter pieties about marital fidelity, but it\u2019s not his inclination anyway. In other ways he challenges Tory cliche as well. Where others applaud the global movement of capital but not of labour, Johnson notes with some pride that he is pretty much the only politician in Britain who says out loud that immigration is a good thing. Yes, it\u2019s a nuanced welcome \u2013 French bankers and brainy go-getters from Singapore are what he mostly has in mind rather than poor Africans desperately jumping lorries in Calais. He has, though, grasped that the influx of foreign money and foreign workers alike was integral to London\u2019s recovery as an economic entity from the mid-80s. His big disclosure today followed a speech about how London would be better off outside the European Union unless David Cameron can negotiate radical reforms. Inevitably, the speech \u2013 made at the launch of a paper by his economics adviser, Gerard Lyons \u2013 has been denounced by opponents as a positioning exercise. It certainly won\u2019t do him any harm. To win any future leadership contest, Johnson would need the backing of plenty of Tory backbenchers followed by most of the votes of the party membership. A bold but measured Euroscepticism will speak to the guts of both groups. So let\u2019s brace ourselves for the next attack of Bozza-mania. The high point so far came in 2012. After winning a second term as London mayor, Johnson then soaked up the reflected rays of the Olympics before taking his party\u2019s annual conference by storm. In the hall at Birmingham, Cameron, tracked down by TV cameras, made a good show of lapping up the outrageous jollity of Johnson\u2019s speech, which praised and impertinently teased him at the same time. Oh, how he laughed! But the core power of Johnson, his endless popularity, meant he could do nothing else. Cameron has welcomed Johnson\u2019s decision to seek a Commons seat: \u201cI\u2019ve always said I want my star players on the pitch\u201d. He surely knows better than anyone that Johnson will never be anyone\u2019s player but his own.    Great news that Boris plans to stand at next year&#39;s general election - I&#39;ve always said I want my star players on the pitch.&mdash; David Cameron (@David_Cameron) August 6, 2014  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/09/tropical-recipes-granita-prawn-salad-jungle-curry-felicity-cloake", "sentences": ["In Malaysia and Singapore they&apos;re eaten at Chinese New Year, although we used to eat them all year round."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-09T06:00:00Z", "title": "Readers' recipe swap: tropical | Felicity Cloake", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Tropical feels like an apt theme in a week of stifling heat and sudden downpours \u2013 weather that may have influenced my choice of winner: GreedyLittlePiggy&apos;s zingy pineapple and lime granita.

Sprinkle with a light dusting of caster sugar, tipping any excess into the coconut. 3 Add the remaining sugar and melted butter to the coconut and stir well. Stir in the yolks one by one, then cover and leave for 1 hour. 4 Stir the mixture again and pour it into the mould. Place this in a roasting tin and put into a cold oven. Pour warm water into the roasting tin to come about halfway up the outside of the mould. 5 Turn the oven on to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and bake for 70 minutes, turning the tray every 20 minutes so the top browns evenly. 6 Once the top is golden and the custard set, remove from the oven and allow it to cool in the mould before loosening the edges and turning out on to a serving plate.

Pass through a sieve to strain. 3 Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan and fry the aubergines over a medium heat for 1 minute. Add the pepper and pork and cook a further minute before adding the strained sauce, pineapple pieces and lime juice. Cook on a medium heat until the pork is just done \u2013 be careful not to overcook it as the meat will become tough. 4 Remove from the heat, scatter with basil leaves and serve with rice and lime wedges. Malaysian pineapple tarts One of my favourite childhood treats, these little tarts are made with pineapple jam. Sweet, crumbly and buttery, they are the perfect taste of the tropics, and literally melt in your mouth. In Malaysia and Singapore they&apos;re eaten at Chinese New Year, although we used to eat them all year round. You will need to make the pineapple jam the day before you are planning on making the tarts as it will need time to cool \u2013 the jam balls can also be made ahead of time and left to firm up in the fridge.Rachel Kelly, London (marmadukescarlet.blogspot.co.uk)  Makes about 30For the pineapple jam2 medium-ripe pineapples, peeled and\u00a0grated1 tbsp fresh lemon juice (or to taste)1 cinnamon stick4 cloves200g granulated sugar (or to taste)  For the tarts500g shortcrust pastry1 egg yolk1 tbsp milk 1 Make the jam: drain the grated pineapple in a sieve, reserving the\u00a0juice. 2 Tip the grated pineapple into a large non-reactive saucepan together with the lemon juice, spices and sugar. Bring to the boil and then simmer gently, stirring occasionally, until it begins to dry out. 3 Add a little of the pineapple juice to the mixture. When it&apos;s evaporated, add more until all of the juice has been incorporated into the mixture. 4 Taste and adjust the sugar or lemon juice depending on how sweet or tart you like it, then cook on a very low heat for about an hour, stirring to prevent it catching, until slightly caramelised and sticky. Discard the cinnamon stick and cloves and set aside to cool. 5 When the jam is completely cooled, heat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3\u00bd and line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Roll out the shortcrust pastry on a floured surface to about 5mm thick. 6 Cut out your tarts using a fluted biscuit cutter. Use your thumb to make a slight indentation in the centre of each pastry circle. Whisk the egg yolk and milk together and brush over the pastry circles, then bake for 10 minutes. 7 Scoop up a small ball of pineapple jam (a melon baller is the perfect tool, or use your hands) and set it in the pastry indentation. 8 Cut out tiny stars or strips of pastry from the trimmings and fix on top of the pineapple balls with a dab of egg wash. Glaze, then return the tarts to the oven for about 10 minutes until they turn a light golden brown."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/how-find-work-experience-paid-internships-live-chat", "sentences": ["The organisation has recently introduced the APSCo intern program which has found internships for graduates in the recruitment sector, both in Singapore and the UK."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-10T09:00:00Z", "title": "How to find work experience and paid internships \u2013 live chat", "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "Live Q and A", "Live Q&A", "Work Experience", "Internships", "Work & careers"], "article": "With many A-level and GCSE students nervously awaiting exam results this August, thoughts will soon turn to celebrations and careers, in that order.

Local NGOs no longer need to get a sponsor, although foreign NGOs still have to. I am certainly seeing a lot more activities around capacity building, social entrepreneurship and training in how to apply more business world strategies for NGOs. Charity corruption scandals have left their mark: With the recent earthquake in Yunnan, people have been circulating warnings on social media about getting duped by fraudsters stealing donation funds and the Red Cross scandal has been in the news again because girl who was the catalyst, Guo Meimei, was recently arrested in Macau. Ruge (Sally) Gao, researcher, Cornell University, Beijing, China A sponsor makes it easier for NGOs to work: It is much easier to establish an NGO with an Chinese government sponsor. A large Chinese corporation may also do. The key to success for NGOs wishing to bring in aid to China is to identify themselves as non-threats to existing cultures. The softly softly approach builds more possibilities for the future: NGOs in China are working towards a careful, curbed and partial success, but small victories nevertheless pave the way for future momentum. If NGOs in the education sector are more accepted for their ability to bring in teachers than their ability to advise on overall education policy, then work with the cards you&apos;re given. Civil society can be approached little by little. Whatever reputation an NGO creates paves the road for future organisations. Mark Sidel, professor of law and public affairs, International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, Madison, USA, @marksidel Not all NGOs are created equal: The state could treat all environmental public interest groups the same, or treat all disability rights groups the same \u2013 but it doesn&apos;t, and that&apos;s very interesting. So a complex situation gets even more complex, as the state allows space for some advocacy groups, while not for others. Charitable giving is on the rise: As a general trend we are seeing enhanced giving, with jumps and dips in particular years, but the trend is upward. And it&apos;s diversifying \u2013 giving for local groups, online giving, formation of foundations and other philanthropic entities, even some giving overseas \u2013 and that makes it all the harder to measure with precision. Xi (Hank) Qizheng, director of programmes, Me to We, Shanghai, China, @hankxi Going up the government hierarchy gets things done: Just like governments elsewhere, China&apos;s consists of many layers: central, provincial, municipal, county, township, rural village. Depending on the mission of an NGO, identifying the appropriate layer of government to work with is key. From our experiences, the &quot;two levels up&quot; rule usually works wonders. Richard Hsu, adjunct professor, school of design and innovation, Tongji University, Shanghai, China, @hsu901 A progressive generation Y is alive and well in China: I am in the midst of many young students, high school and university. They want to contribute, act, change ... The common question is: how can we bring change? Civic mindedness is not prominent: When money, wealth and winning are the foremost prominent thoughts in a population&apos;s mind, how can they be distracted with civic activities? This problem is not exclusivel to China - look at Singapore, Hong Kong, London, New York and Los Angeles. Richard Brubaker, founder, Collective Responsibility, Shanghai, China, @richbrubaker Keeping your head down is the best way to make progress: The key is to maintain a focus on the work, solve problems, and engage as many people as one can in the process so that pilots can be proven, programmes can be stabilised, and trust can be developed. I don&apos;t know if that is thriving, but it is progress, and progress worth maintaining. Maya Wang, China researcher, Human Rights Watch, Hong Kong, @wang_maya Human rights are not getting better: In the past year since President Xi Jinping came into power we&apos;ve seen a worsening of human rights. Xi has staged a strategic, multi-pronged crackdown, with a focus on the press, internet, and NGOs. The needs are great: As China moves rapidly from communism to capitalism, many groups find themselves losing the basic &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; or any other social security they used to have. These people are also finding the government largely unresponsive to their needs because of corruption, lack of effective channels for redress, lack of democracy. So there&apos;s tremendous needs in society, and NGOs are moving in to fill them. You need to be creative to survive, but be aware of the risks: To work around restrictions NGOs can work on less sensitive topics, with friendly government officials, partner with local organisations and try to funding sources that aren&apos;t considered &quot;sensitive&quot;. All of that is being done very creatively by many on the ground. But, we have to ask ourselves whether doing so might compromise one&apos;s original intentions. Helping the government maintain the status quo in some ways undermines long-term prospects, as ultimately civil society does need a free press, a democratic government and freedom of association.

In a perfect coals-to-Newcastle move, a South Korean chain has opened a bakery called Paris Baguette in the heart of the French capital. The food chain now says its global aim is to become to bread what McDonald&apos;s is to hamburgers, with plans to expand into 60 countries in the next six years. The new 200-square meter boulangerie opened last month within walking distance from the Louvre, Paris City Hall, the Pont Neuf bridge and Notre Dame cathedral. To assuage French amour propre \u2013 and throw a metaphorical crust to the critics \u2013 it has joined the Chambre Professionnelle des Artisans Boulangers-Patissiers, which requires all members to adhere to traditional baking standards. The Paris Baguette bakery chain was founded in 1988 by the Korean businessman Hur Young-in, head of the food and confectionary group SPC. It has 3,250 boulangerie \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise outlets in South Korea and bakeries in America, Singapore, Vietnam and China where it aims to open 500 shops. At worldwide outlets outside France it calls itself a &quot;traditional French bakery&quot; \u2013 its logo features the Eiffel Tower \u2013 and employees wear stripy Breton T-shirts and berets. However, much of the bread is made in South Korea, frozen and dispatched around the globe. At its first Paris outlet in the central 1st arrondissement near the Seine, the huge Paris Baguette boulangerie, with its chocolate brown awnings, employs local chefs and claims to use &quot;only traditional French bakery ingredients and methods&quot;. &quot;We regard France as the spiritual home of our bakery products,&quot; Hur Young-in told the Korea Herald to mark the launch of the Paris boulangerie. &quot;The opening of our Paris store highlights our commitment to continually improving and perfecting the quality of our European-style bread and pastries.&quot; Few things are more sacred and symbolic to the French than bread in general, and the baguette in particular. Like wine, cheese, garlic, snails and berets, it has become one of the emblems of the nation, its people, traditions and the &quot;terroir&quot;, the notion of the land and the food it provides. These long thin loaves \u2013 the word baguette also means wand \u2013 are made from a small and specific list of ingredients laid down by decree 93-1074 of 13 September 1993. The French consume around 10 billion baguettes every year. The traditional baguette can only be made with wheat flour, water, yeast or raising agent and salt. It must not contain any egg, milk products, oil or any preservatives. There are sub-clauses allowing limited deviations from the rules, mostly relating to the type of flour used. It is around 5cm-6cm wide, 3cm-4cm high and around 65cm long. The average weight is 250g. Legend has it that they were made stick-like by Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte&apos;s bakers so they could be transported by the empire&apos;s soldiers in a pocket in their uniform trousers, though modern historians have cast doubt on what they dismiss as an urban myth. In addition to the regulations concerning what is in baguettes, only those who make the dough and bake the bread in situ are allowed to call themselves a &quot;boulangers&quot;. Dominique Anract, president of the Chambre Professionnelle des Artisans Boulangers-Patissiers, said: &quot;Anyone can make a traditional baguette, and companies are opening bakeries here, there and everywhere in the world. The question that concerns us is not whether it can be done, but whether what is produced is a good baguette. &quot;It takes two years to train to become a boulanger, but even then it doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re any good. That takes at least 10 years.&quot; Anract added: &quot;I&apos;m not worried about people making traditional baguettes as long as it&apos;s not done any-old-how, as long as they are of a correct standard and good quality. That&apos;s my worry. We have to protect our product.&quot; In August 2011, an entrepreneurial Parisian baker introduced the first baguette vending machine, filling it with partially cooked sticks that were given a final baking when ordered. As if really pushing its luck with the French, the Korean company also owns the trademark Paris Croissant."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/aug/13/candy-crush-saga-king-zynga", "sentences": ["The first signs of the latter came this week as part of King\u2019s latest financial results: it\u2019s buying a Singapore-based developed called Nonstop Games in a deal that could be worth up to $100m if certain targets are hit."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-13T09:53:37Z", "title": "Peak Candy Crush?

The company reported revenues of $593.6m and a net profit of $165.4m for the second quarter of 2014, which sounds healthy enough: most mobile games companies would be more than happy with those numbers. But those revenues were actually down on the first quarter\u2019s $606.7m \u2013 the first time King has recorded such a fall since before Candy Crush mania took off in early 2013. Its gross bookings \u2013 a measure used by social games companies for how much people are spending in their games \u2013 were also down, from $641.1m in the first quarter of this year to $611.1m in the second quarter. Here\u2019s the phrase \u2013 from King\u2019s official results announcement \u2013 that summarises why Wall Street has been spooked enough to knock off close to a quarter of the value of the company, which went public earlier in the year:  \u201cThe decreases in both gross bookings and revenue from first quarter 2014 to second quarter 2014 were primarily due to lower gross bookings from Candy Crush Saga, which were only partially offset by increased gross bookings and revenue from Farm Heroes Saga and Bubble Witch 2 Saga following its launch on web and mobile in June 2014.\u201d  Players are spending less money in King\u2019s powerhouse puzzle game, and the newer Saga titles that have joined it on Apple and Google\u2019s app stores aren\u2019t yet making up for that decline. But will that change in the coming months? The worst nightmare for King is the recent history of one of its key rivals: Zynga. I\u2019ve been comparing the two companies\u2019 financial results, and there\u2019s a real risk for King that this summer could be its equivalent of Zynga\u2019s summer of 2012: a peak in revenues and players, followed by a steady decline. Could players fall out of love with \u201cSaga\u201d games as they did with \u201cVille\u201d games two years ago? Here\u2019s some of the data behind that comparison, with apologies for the tiny text labels \u2013 they\u2019re not a barrier to understanding the trends. In each graph, King\u2019s financials are the blue line, and Zynga\u2019s the red. What the numbers show First, quarterly revenues for the two companies from the earliest point they were published in their respective IPO prospectuses: going back to the first quarter of 2010 for Zynga, and the first quarter of 2012 for King:     King\u2019s revenues rose fast, but could be set to fall. Source: King/Zynga/The Guardian    King\u2019s revenues seem to have peaked in the third quarter of 2013, at the height of the Candy Crush craze. Zynga\u2019s peaked in the first quarter of 2012, and the couple of quarters after each peak look strikingly similar on the graph. How about bookings: that measure of how much people are actually spending on virtual items within each company\u2019s games?     Another peak of spending for King and Zynga. Source: King/Zynga/The Guardian    Turning my attention to player numbers, I chose to compare monthly unique users (MUUs in industry parlance) rather than monthly active users (MAUs), in an effort to understand how their overall number of players has risen and fallen \u2013 without players being counted twice if they play several games:     Only one quarter of MUU decline so far for King, but it\u2019s a worry for investors. Source: King/Zynga/The Guardian    It\u2019s also worth looking at the number of monthly unique payers (MUPs) \u2013 the number of people who\u2019ve actually spent money within King and Zynga\u2019s games, as opposed to simply playing them for free:     King\u2019s declining money-spenders isn\u2019t just a 2014 phenomenon. Source: King/Zynga/The Guardian    King\u2019s high-point for monthly unique payers was actually last summer: the third quarter of 2013. Its MUPs have now fallen for three consecutive quarters, even if it\u2019s only in the second quarter of this year that the company\u2019s revenues declined. What does this comparison suggest? Here\u2019s my theory: when Zynga\u2019s business peaked in the summer of 2012 and then started to decline, one of the main causes was Ville-ennui. People who\u2019d been addicted to games like FarmVille and CityVille were tiring of the format: seeing new Ville games and deciding not to go down that long, clicky road again. The brand itself became a bit of a millstone, and Zynga wasn\u2019t able to win those players back with newer games. The big risk for King in 2014 is that \u201cSaga\u201d is the new \u201cVille\u201d. Are more players who\u2019ve sweet-swapped their way several hundred levels into Candy Crush Saga taking a look at new Saga games, with their familiar three-star level maps, and opting out? It\u2019s pure speculation: the financial data is supporting material for this hypothesis, but it certainly doesn\u2019t prove it yet. I do wonder, though, whether it\u2019s a risk for any mobile game that becomes a craze \u2013 people may disappear down its digital rabbit hole for months, but when they resurface, the prospect of doing it again may not appeal. And it\u2019s at this point that a company like Zynga or King needs to come up with new ideas and brands that don\u2019t feel like that same old rabbit hole. Why might this theory be bunkum? First, because there are some key differences between the two companies. One reason for Zynga\u2019s decline was that its big success came on the web, on Facebook, just before the world and its aunt went mad for mobile games. Zynga had some successes \u2013 Zynga Poker for example \u2013 but overall it struggled to adapt to a rapid shift in social gaming from web to mobile. Some of its high-profile moves to adapt \u2013 buying the developer of the Draw Something game just as that craze peaked \u2013 flopped dramatically. King\u2019s rise, on the other hand, was fuelled by exactly that shift from web to mobile: its revenues and audience took off like a rocket in the first quarter of 2013 as Candy Crush mania took hold on smartphones and tablets. King had been around for years before that making web and Facebook games, but if it\u2019s about to enter a tough period now, it\u2019s not because of a platform transition. A second difference between the two companies is their profitability. Since early 2012, Zynga has usually posted quarterly losses of tens of millions of dollars. By contrast, here are King\u2019s quarterly profits since the start of 2013: $52.7m, $125.9m, $229.8m, $159.2m, $127.2m, $165.4m. That should have helped the company build up a war chest for the next reason it might not be about to enter a Zynga-style decline: it can plough money into developing new non-Saga games, and it can scout about for acquisitions of companies that might bring it new hits. The first signs of the latter came this week as part of King\u2019s latest financial results: it\u2019s buying a Singapore-based developed called Nonstop Games in a deal that could be worth up to $100m if certain targets are hit. The studio will be working on \u201cnew games outside of its traditional casual genre\u201d to launch in 2015. King\u2019s stonking Candy Crush profits, together with its recent IPO, could be a base to snap up promising-looking developers and games as they emerge. Note Zynga\u2019s recent upturn in some of the graphs above: partly fuelled by its acquisition of Clumsy Ninja developer NaturalMotion earlier this year. Acquisitions could also address one of the biggest criticisms levelled at its Saga series: that it\u2019s just rejigged versions of older games from other publishers like Bejeweled (Candy Crush Saga), Puzzle Bobble (Bubble Witch Saga) and Peggle (Papa Pear Saga). It\u2019s also worth noting that King is getting ready to release Candy Crush Soda Saga, which is an official sequel to the company\u2019s biggest hit. The new game has been soft-launched in a few countries, with a global launch expected soon. Whether it can escape Saga-ennui is another question, though. King isn\u2019t guaranteed to be the next Zynga in terms of business decline, in other words. But its latest financial results are a stark reminder to its management and investors alike that it needs to learn the lessons from the FarmVille firm\u2019s fall since its peak in the summer of 2012. \u2022 Why is Candy Crush Saga so popular?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/14/honourable-woman-tv-highlights", "sentences": ["This week, the pair are splitting their time and skills across two commuter heavens in Kent, where they are looking for a family home for recently-returned-from-Singapore expats and their new baby, and where a couple are looking to buy their first home together."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-14T05:00:00Z", "title": "TV highlights 14/08/2014", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "Rugby League: Hull KR v Wigan Warriors7.30pm, Sky Sports 1 Hull Kingston Rovers are in Rugby League no man&apos;s land.

Sorry, I&apos;m catching it from them; they do like a play on words. Or their scriptwriter does. They&apos;re trying to find a house for a couple called Gemma and Robin. One property, says Kirstie, has an hour-and-a-half commute to London for Robin, and we cut to a picture of a robin, the bird with a red breast. There&apos;s mileage in that one. A 15-minute walk to the station &quot;has Robin in a flap&quot;, says Phil. &quot;Robin doesn&apos;t seem sold on feathering this nest just yet,&quot; adds Kirstie. &quot;Reliant on Robin feeling the love, I&apos;m going to try and convince him of the area,&quot; says Phil, slipping in a random reference to a three-wheeled car of the 1970s. Given that it&apos;s all about areas, they might have done something along the lines of, &quot;We&apos;re here to tell Robin &apos;hood is more important than anything else.&quot; Especially if we were in the Nottingham area. We&apos;re not though, we&apos;re in Kent. Still think they missed one there.

Anyway, Gemma and Robin, who are just back from living in Singapore, say they don&apos;t really mind where they live, so long as it&apos;s the right kind of character house, quintessentially English (as opposed to Singaporean), preferably with plenty of period features. Which makes a bit of a mockery of the whole premise of the show, certainly of the title. House, House, House, more like. Phil shows them a 1930s terraced house in Beckenham but Gemma doesn&apos;t like the colour or the cobwebs (is she unaware of the paintbrush and the hoover?). So he takes them to a lovely waterside house in the village of Wateringbury, which is perfect, but the commute is too far for Robin. And again near Tunbridge Wells, the house is perfect but it&apos;s too far from the station \u2026 Ah, you see, Gemma and Robin, &apos;hood is what it&apos;s all about, and Phil and Kirstie know best. The other couple, Barney and Gemma \u2013 a different Gemma, we haven&apos;t suddenly morphed into Wife Swap \u2013 like everything they see, though I&apos;m worried that those gardens look very shady. It&apos;s very important which way a garden faces, especially a tiny garden, and they never give it enough thought on Location, Location, Location. In the end, both Gemmas and their respective Robin and Barney end up with lovely houses, neither of which Phil and Kirstie found or indeed had anything to do with. Oh. Well, it was fun getting here, in spite of all the punning and peppermint perkiness. I&apos;m not proud of enjoying LLL. Property is, if not theft, then certainly boring, especially other people&apos;s. What is the appeal then? Nosiness, a peak through the letterbox into someone else&apos;s life? Jealousy, perhaps, if you&apos;re not even on the bottom rung; or conceitedness, if you&apos;re already well up there, looking down. Or, worse still, an inner Thatcherite, not just fuelling a national obsession, but also having a say in your viewing habits. May as well stay with it, though, and A Place in the Sun: Home or Away (More4) has an extra element: foreign adventure. Sensible, likable retired couple Janette and Martin want a canalside property where they can tie up their narrowboat. So Jonnie Irwin shows them some damp, dreary houses in the Midlands that cost a ton of money. And Laura Hamilton shows them some glorious houses on the Canal du Midi in southern France that cost almost nothing. And they go for the former, to be near the grandchildren. It&apos;s reassuring, I guess, that people are more important. And that Phil and Kirstie are, and always have been, right. Look at that view though, over to the Pyrenees.

In 2000, the first line of the\u00a0Delhi Metro was a couple of years away, and the rampant and haphazard construction work ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games had not yet left the city altered \u2013 in some places, beyond recognition. Idha, the narrator of A Bad Character, drives around Delhi in a car her father has given her as compensation for his abandoning her for a life in Singapore. Following her mother&apos;s death, she has left her hometown of Agra and come to\u00a0Delhi to live with her maternal aunt,\u00a0who is eager to marry her off to a divorced Indian-American. Her college life, too, is unremarkable, and she is filled with a desperation brought on by\u00a0the suffocating middle-class morality of her world. In order to escape her ennui, Idha starts an affair with a man whom she finds irresistible because he represents everything her aunt despises. They have sex in his flat\u00a0and take drugs, a far cry from the security and claustrophobia of her aunt&apos;s household. In an interview with the Indian newspaper Mint, Kapoor cited French writer Marguerite Duras among her influences, and she has evidently tried to emulate the non-linear narrative structure and minimalist prose style of\u00a0Duras&apos;s 1984 novel The Lover, set in French Indochina. However, this homage doesn&apos;t work very well when she tries to recreate the racial power dynamics of the relationship between the impecunious French protagonist and her wealthy, much older Chinese lover in Duras&apos;s novel. Idha&apos;s lover is &quot;black-skinned&quot; and &quot;looks like a servant&quot;, with an exotic American accent. The novel abounds with hackneyed descriptions of India. &quot;The insects of India swarmed,&quot; Kapoor writes helpfully, for the reader who was unsure about the provenance of the insects at a roadside eatery on the Jaipur road. As a child travelling in Varanasi with her parents, Idha hears &quot;the hacking of phlegm in the throat that is the song of India&quot;. Watching &quot;the red-jacketed coolies&quot; in the train station, she finds their &quot;teak-hard bodies absurd beneath the colour of their uniforms&quot;. Should their uniforms be coordinated with their skin tones? Sometimes Kapoor writes with extraordinary honesty about Delhi. In\u00a0one of the lighter moments, Idha describes a familiar Delhi experience: every day, the same car in her neighbourhood reverses at 6am. &quot;The\u00a0reverse gear plays a song: Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday to you.&quot; She also captures the\u00a0frustrations of life in the city: the monotony of jogging in circles around small parks; being stared at; the lone woman driver who arouses suspicion. But, more often than not, she gives into the temptation to exoticise Delhi, and India, for the reader. Many Indian women cover their heads on a daily basis, but when Idha does so at a Sufi shrine, she feels she becomes &quot;Persian, dark-eyed, pious and transformed&quot;. Idha&apos;s desperation makes her apathetic to the people around her. It is difficult for her to understand a city in which she has been placed almost violently; her alienation, confusion and existential anxiety are the natural outcomes of her situation. Idha&apos;s childhood memories of her\u00a0mother make for some poignant reading. However, when Kapoor tries to explore the complexities of middle-class India, she is only able to make remarks that sound like something out\u00a0of an economics textbook (&quot;The economy is opening up. Jobs are found. Land is bought and sold&quot;).

The news follows the detention of four couples \u2013 two Australian and two American \u2013 who tried to fly out of Bangkok this week but were held by immigration authorities amid sudden plans to overhaul existing surrogacy laws. Thai immigration police told the Australian federal police on Friday that they had detained a same-sex Australian couple flying to Singapore because &quot;they didn&apos;t have documents to prove that the father is the child&apos;s legal guardian&quot;. Authorities told the couple they needed a court order before they would be permitted to leave the kingdom. According to ABC reports, the couple have now been able to leave the country with their newborn twins who were born last month via a surrogate and have arrived in Singapore. It is understood several other couples remain in Thailand and are speaking with the Australian embassy in Bangkok to try to resolve their cases. It is unclear just how many other couples of other nationalities may have been detained under similar circumstances. A US embassy spokesperson in Bangkok told the Guardian on Friday that &quot;some parents with children born via surrogacy have not been permitted to exit [Thailand]&quot; but would not clarify the exact number, while the UK embassy in Bangkok said that they had not received any requests for guidance regarding surrogacy. Up to 200 Australian couples may be affected by Thailand&apos;s new regulations, effectively rendering them &quot;pawns in a disastrous game&quot;, a leading surrogacy lawyer told the Guardian. It is believed that around 150 surrogate babies are currently in Thailand, ostensibly waiting to be taken out of the country by their biological parents. On Wednesday, Thailand&apos;s military government gave preliminary approval for a draft law making commercial surrogacy a criminal offence, largely due to an international outcry over the case of an Australian couple accused of abandoning their baby boy, called Gammy, after finding out he had Down&apos;s syndrome. The Western Australian couple took Gammy&apos;s healthy twin sister home. The new law \u2013 which authorities expect to ratify by the end of the year \u2013 would allow only legally married couples to file for parental rights of a child born to a surrogate mother. It is not clear whether individuals, unmarried or same-sex couples, would be able to take part in surrogacy agreements, but as gay marriage is not recognised in Thailand, it does not seem likely. Australia&apos;s department of foreign affairs and trade has urged Thai authorities to allow a transitional period so that Australians already into the surrogacy process are not penalised.     Surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua poses with baby Gammy in Bangkok. Photograph: Handout/Getty Images    &quot;We strongly urge Australians entering Thailand for the purposes of commercial surrogacy to seek independent legal advice in both Thailand and Australia before doing so,&quot; a spokeswoman said. &quot;In particular, they should seek advice on the implications of any new exit requirements.&quot; In a statement posted on their closed Facebook wall, Surrogacy Australia said it would not be commenting on the situation to the media, but more than 200 couples might be affected, SBS reported. The US embassy in Bangkok told the Guardian that embassy officials are investigating what kind of impact the new regulations will have on US-citizen parents who have already engaged in surrogacy agreements in Thailand. According to leading Australian surrogacy lawyer Stephen Page, such couples will now have to face the Thai family court, which traditionally rules that children should stay with their birth mother. The Gammy case showed Thai authorities how fraught surrogacy arrangements without strong judicial oversight were and embarrassed them internationally, he said, prompting the swift reaction. &quot;But that couples are now being stopped at the airport is extraordinary,&quot; he said. &quot;What&apos;s really concerning is the Thai government has changed the rules halfway through the game and virtually overnight. These couples who had gone into this process in good faith now find themselves pawns in a disastrous game.&quot; He said to avoid a repeat of the Gammy case, Australian legislation that criminalised commercial surrogacy in all jurisdictions but the Northern Territory, and which was often discriminatory, needed to be overhauled. Australian couples chose Bangkok in large numbers because it was close, perceived as cheaper, and until recently had not sought to ban commercial surrogacy, Page said. &quot;The first thing we need is a strong framework of international law so everyone knows what&apos;s up and we don&apos;t have this vague situation like in Thailand or India where the rules suddenly get changed. &quot;Certainly the leading players in the commercial surrogacy field include the US, who act from a human rights and feminist perspective with their laws. &quot;Above all, their surrogacy laws have a strong judicial oversight and I can&apos;t emphasise the importance of that enough.&quot;     George Brandis, right, called for a coordinated international response to overseas surrogacy arrangements. Photograph: LUKAS COCH/AAPIMAGE    Changes to Australian commercial surrogacy laws could be driven by a convention specifically relating to surrogacy, according to Page. The Hague convention &quot;protects children and their families against the risks of illegal, irregular, premature or ill-prepared adoptions&quot; overseas. It&apos;s a suggestion echoed by the Australian attorney general, George Brandis, who on Thursday released a report on parentage and the family law act calling for a coordinated international response to overseas surrogacy arrangements. &quot;Council believes this issue requires a coordinated international regulatory response of the kind embodied in the Hague adoption convention,&quot; the report said. Page said the Gammy case almost guaranteed that the next special commission of the Hague conference&apos;s convention on intercountry adoption in 2015 would adopt a convention on surrogacy. On Friday, research released in the Medical Journal of Australia found that legislation criminalising compensated surrogacy was doing little to stop Australian would-be parents entering into arrangements with overseas surrogates. The authors called for an urgent review of surrogacy-related laws following the anonymous online survey of 259 intended parents in partnership with Surrogacy Australia. Only 9% of respondents were deterred by laws criminalising commercial surrogacy arrangements overseas and 44% never considered uncompensated, or altruistic, surrogacy. &quot;The high proportion of intended parents using overseas instead of domestic surrogacy arrangements shows that Australian public policy in this area is failing,&quot; the study said. &quot;It appears that the drive to have a child for people who need surrogacy is greater than the barriers erected by Australian legislators.&quot; But the medical director of IVF Australia, Dr Peter Illingworth, said overseas surrogacy arrangements were complex and fraught with risk. Australian couples had to hand their embryo over to people who were usually complete strangers, he said, and there was a perception that rich people were paying poor people to take health risks on their behalf. &quot;Any pregnancy carries risk and while most are safe and happy events, there are of course complication risks,&quot; Illingworth said. &quot;What we need to do is see what we can do to make surrogacy more practical for people who need to use it in Australia.&quot; Altruistic surrogacy was restricted to women without a uterus, those medically unfit and unable to carry a pregnancy to full term, and to same-sex couples. There are said to be around 100 such cases each year.. Would-be parents often felt insecure throughout the pregnancy of the surrogate, Illingworth added, because legal arrangements about parentage of the child were not finalised until after the birth. &quot;This creates great uncertainty for all participants in the surrogacy process. Surrogate law could be improved in Australia by giving parents more certainty by sorting out legal arrangements from the very beginning.&quot; The press officer for the ambassador of Thailand, Maris Sangiampongsa, did not return calls from the Guardian Australia requesting comment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/aug/15/good-to-talk-terrorists", "sentences": ["\u201cGaza could be Singapore,\u201d says Dr Kurz, doing precisely that."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-15T18:30:12Z", "title": "Sometimes it\u2019s good to talk - even to \u2018terrorists\u2019 | Giles Fraser", "tags": ["Gaza", "Anglicanism", "Christianity", "Religion", "London", "UK news", "Hamas", "Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "Palestinian territories", "World news"], "article": "It wasn\u2019t exactly the French Riviera. But the beachside cafe did passable mezze. The waves lapped at the sand in that familiar holiday rhythm suggestive of sunscreen, ice-cream and novels. It was the Mediterranean, after all. Perhaps this is what they call a development opportunity, I idly mused to myself, sipping cold Coke. But the green Hamas flags\u00a0fluttering at regular intervals down the beach told a different story. This was, apparently, the land of terrorists \u2013 a word that remains so freighted with emotion that those labelled with it are deemed beyond human conversation. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk to terrorists\u201d is such a familiar political mantra that we tend to assume we know why we won\u2019t. But things change. And they change through talking. I mean, if former IRA boss Martin McGuinness can take part in a toast to the Queen at Windsor Castle, then anything\u2019s possible. Surely? Dr Anat Kurz meets me in her office at the Institute for National Security Studies, a part of Tel Aviv University, where she is the director of research and an expert on Hamas and terrorism. It feels a plugged-in, official kind of place. Justice minister, Tzipi Livni, had popped round earlier that morning. Dr Kurz pulls out a packet of thin white cigarettes and muses on the state of the Israel/Gaza conflict. We talk about talks. \u201cIsrael does not want to destroy Hamas,\u201d she says to my surprise, \u201cThere\u2019s a shift in the Israeli position.\u201d Several years ago, Israel\u2019s stated aim was to eradicate Hamas. \u201cBut now, Israel wants to leave Hamas enough capability because it is the most organised force in the Gaza Strip.\u201d Yes, she feels great bitterness towards Hamas. She speaks of the hundreds of children that have died digging tunnels, while Hamas bigwigs have villas and swimming pools. But better the devil you know. \u201cLook at the neighbourhood,\u201d she says. Whatever you think of Hamas, they are not as ideologically murderous as Islamic State (Isis). Hamas does not crucify the Christians of Gaza, for example. The word terrorist lumps all these groups together. But there is a difference between them that the emotions and the language of terrorism does not always allow. Indeed, Dr Kurz is reluctant to label Hamas as terrorists \u2013 she argues they are involved in a guerrilla war. And the lawless Egyptian Sinai, Israel\u2019s back yard, could easily become the next battleground for Isis. There is worse than Hamas out there. So much worse. Yes, the Hamas charter, drawn up in 1988, explicitly calls for the destruction of Israel. Yes, it is antisemitic. But nonetheless, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal has claimed that the charter is \u201ca piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons\u201d. And Hamas number two, Mousa Abu Marzouk (with a PhD from Louisiana Tech), has gone ever further and called it \u201cdefunct\u201d: \u201cThe charter is not the Qur\u2019an. It can be amended.\u201d Maybe sincere, maybe not. But you don\u2019t get the impression that Isis would say anything like this. Nor indeed that Isis would be interested in participating in any sort of democratic process \u2013 remember Hamas won elections in the Gaza Strip in 2006. Whatever one thinks of the war in Gaza \u2013 no one knows how long the ceasefire will last \u2013 there can be no military solution for either side. It can only be achieved through talks. And talks that are genuinely intended to find political settlement. The demonisation of Hamas and indeed the demonisation of Israel does nothing to help these talks. The current war came about because of years of missed opportunities. And the label \u201cterrorism\u201d has regularly been used as an alibi not to talk. If there is to be any sort of peace, both sides have to think about each other differently. \u201cGaza could be Singapore,\u201d says Dr Kurz, doing precisely that.

Good, because I need some engineers. Rather a lot, in fact. Unfazed by complex data and comfortable with technical theory and practice, engineers are a rarefied breed of problem-solvers. Or at least they are here in Britain. In the next six years, nearly 3m engineering jobs will be unfilled. With a shortage of supply, and growing demand, we certainly can\u2019t afford for the brightest minds to be snared by the City\u2019s big bucks. Today, Dyson has a shortfall of 100 engineers. Next year we begin our \u00a3300m expansion, creating thousands of research and development roles in Wiltshire. I like our laboratories to be busy, creative hives buzzing with brain power \u2013 rather like a school. I don\u2019t like clinical white-coated silence. And so we need more \u201cbrains\u201d. Dyson needs them. Britain needs them. Otherwise we will lose out to China and India \u2013 countries that revere engineers \u2013 when it comes to developing, patenting and exporting new technology. Twelve years ago, Dyson stopped assembling vacuums in the UK. One major reason was a failure to secure planning permission for a second factory adjacent to our existing one. Ironically, the factory we mothballed is now the R&amp;D space we are outgrowing. The ironies continue: our new laboratories will rise on the very spot of our never-built second factory. The closure of our assembly lines was painful, but it meant focusing on developing technology here in the UK. For example, our ultra-high-speed digital motors are conceived and engineered here. We\u2019ve been developing them now for more than 15 years. They use new technology which makes them much smaller and more efficient \u2013 a revolution in motor design. I can say that, because I\u2019m not clever enough to invent a motor. But I am lucky enough to work with people who are. Every six seconds one of these motors rolls off the line. Actually it\u2019s more of a very accurate placing, and it\u2019s all totally automated, in Singapore \u2013 close to the lines that make the Airblade hand-dryers and cordless vacuums they are to propel, and close to Singapore\u2019s rapidly growing engineering talent pool. Somewhere in that tale is a warning. Britain fell out of love with manufacturing, and emerging economies picked up the tools we\u2019d downed. If the encouraging renaissance of science and engineering in schools is a dead cat bounce, we will fall out of love with invention too. When you crunch the numbers, just 4% of this year\u2019s A-levels were in physics \u2013 an essential subject for most engineering courses. A problem. But the problems start even earlier. Research by the Royal Academy of Engineering shows that only half of 16-year-olds in England pass both GCSE maths and at least two sciences, meaning half of our young people are disadvantaged if they wish to pursue engineering. Yes, science is perceived as hard. But a bigger problem is that young people don\u2019t know what a career in science or engineering offers. An engineer is not a man in greasy overalls or a harebrained oddball (though I have a soft spot for the latter). They are technologists, developing ideas to shape our future. That\u2019s why my foundation works with young people from primary school age to dispel the myths and help them discover what a career in engineering is like. Science and design and technology in schools must highlight the excitement of developing ideas and experimenting with new materials \u2013 carbon fibre, not just cardboard. Learning by doing, failing in the process, and trying again. The classroom must equip young people with the skills to bring these ideas to life, and most importantly the enthusiasm to embark on further study. We have seen exactly this. For the past two years we have been working with five schools in Bath encouraging students as young as 13 to discover the world of engineering \u2013 high-tech equipment working alongside an industry-relevant curriculum. Uptake in design and technology has increased by 200%, and crucially more girls are taking it up too. I want the biggest discoveries of the future to take place on our soil. We must build on the reputation of our world-class universities. That starts by feeding in the best young people from our schools. If we get it right we will fill our pipeline with highly skilled inventors, develop patentable technology and export it around the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/aug/19/international-teachers-life-classroom-schools", "sentences": ["From Singapore to Uruguay, New Zealand to America, teaching looks very different depending on where in the world you work."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-19T11:04:32Z", "title": "Teachers around the world \u2013 tell us about life in your classroom", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching", "Primary schools", "Secondary schools", "Schools"], "article": "From Singapore to Uruguay, New Zealand to America, teaching looks very different depending on where in the world you work.

Travel forward to 21st century Britain and find the fruit that so inspired artists and architects and that was generally regarded with both joy and awe in Europe, has become so debased. I often see intrepid dumpster-divers rooting through the detritus of the Ridley Road market in east London, pulling out discarded pineapples and other over-ripe fruit. Our ancestors would have wept to see such glorious fruit so rubbished. I\u2019ve been using fresh pineapple a lot in my cooking recently, but I don\u2019t always need a whole one. So I\u2019ve had to come up with other ideas for using the rest of the pineapple, and not just in tropical fruit salads.  I have learned that pineapples don\u2019t ripen further after harvesting, so you really do need to buy the ripest pineapple you can find. The pineapple should feel firm, but not too hard. If it feels very soft or appears bruised then it is probably rotten. It is worth having a look at the base of the fruit too, as sometimes there are signs of mould.  Smell your pineapple; it should smell fresh, sweet and aromatic. I also tend to weigh up my pineapples \u2013 a heavy pineapple is a juicy pineapple. Check the spiky leaves too and avoid it if they are looking tatty or withered. Whole, fresh pineapple can be stored at room temperature in a cool room for two days. Otherwise store the pineapple in the fridge. Pineapple that has already been prepared will store in the fridge for about 3 days. Leaving a pineapple for a couple of days should reduce some of its tart acidity. I have also read that microwaving chunks of pineapple for about a minute, allowing to cool and then refrigerating, is said to diminish the acidity and prevents fresh pineapple from making your tongue surface sore.  Oh and one of the other things I have learned, is that you can\u2019t make pineapple jelly. No really, you can\u2019t.  1. Singapore hot and sour prawn and pineapple soup This is a \u201cNyonya\u201d dish, reflecting its Chinese antecedents with Malaysian flavours. You used to see it served in restaurants in a hollowed out pineapple. This recipe is also a bit of a \u201ctwofer\u201d in that it can be served both as a soup, or over rice or noodles, with the broth served on the side. Serves 4 2 tbsp vegetable oil1-2 tbsp tamarind paste1 tbsp palm sugar1.2 litres water450g raw prawns, peeled and deveined4 thick slices of fresh pineapple, cored and cut into bite-sized chunksSalt and freshly ground black pepperFresh coriander and mint, chopped, to serve(serve with plain rice or noodles)Spice paste:4 shallots, chopped4 red chillies, chopped1 lemongrass stalk, peeled and finely chopped25g fresh ginger, peeled and chopped1 tsp belachan (shrimp paste) First make the spice paste by combining all the paste ingredients in a blender and whizzing up until a paste forms. Heat the oil in a heavy-based saucepan or wok. Add the spice paste and fry until it takes on a little colour and releases its fragrance. Stir occasionally. This may only take 1 minute. Add the tamarind paste and sugar. Stir well. Add the water. Stir well. Bring to the boil and then simmer for 10 minutes. Add the prawns and pineapple. Simmer for 5 minutes or until the prawns are cooked through. Scoop up the prawns and pineapple and divide between 4 bowls. Top with the hot soup. Sprinkle over a little chopped coriander and mint. 2. Pickled pineapple A tongue-twister of a sweet and sour pickle makes the perfect accompaniment to curries, roast pork and grilled or cold meats.     Complement your next curry with some pickled pineapple. Photograph: Rachel Kelly    2 dried chillies, soaked in boiling water1 tbsp fresh ginger, very finely chopped1 garlic clove, very finely chopped1 tbsp yellow mustard seeds1 tsp ground turmeric200ml rice vinegar (or white wine vinegar)1 tbsp palm sugar (or light brown sugar)Half a ripe pineapple, cored and cut into chunksSalt, to taste Drain the chillies from their soaking liquid and squeeze dry. Tip them into a blender with the ginger and garlic. Blend to a paste and decant to a clean bowl. Heat a small heavy-based frying pan until very hot. Dry fry the mustard seeds until they begin to pop and release their fragrance. Add the mustard seeds and ground turmeric to the spice paste, together with the vinegar and sugar. Stir well to combine. Set aside for about 10 minutes to ensure that the sugar has dissolved.  Add the chopped pineapple and salt, to taste. Stir to ensure the pineapple is well coated in the pickling liquid. The pineapple pickle is ready to eat, although benefits from an hour or so of aging. It will keep well in the fridge for about three days. Other ideas for using up leftover pineapple: 3.

But, according to friends, Lewis Hamilton has returned to Europe from his summer holiday focused as he has rarely been before. Hamilton has targeted the next six weeks, which will feature races in Belgium this Sunday, followed by those in Italy, Singapore and Japan, as the pivotal phase of this year\u2019s Formula One world championship. It\u2019s a two-car title race between Hamilton and his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg, who leads by 11 points with eight grands prix to go. And the British driver is also invigorated by the notion that his wretched luck during the first half of the season has now turned. There was certainly some neurosis-balming good fortune to accompany his brilliance in the last round in Hungary at the end of July, when he beat Rosberg. After that race Hamilton spoke with a hyper-kinetic energy about his performance. Now he appears to be in the mood to assert his authority \u2013 that of the fastest driver as well as a former world champion \u2013 on Mercedes and the 2014 season. In truth, the handcuffed closeness of Hamilton and Rosberg in the season so far would suggest the championship is more likely to be decided in Austin or Brazil \u2013 the penultimate race \u2013 but hopefully not in the double-pointer farce that will be the final event in Abu Dhabi on 23 November, a desperate contrivance that will represent a low point in Formula One. Rosberg, winner of four races this year and second in five more, cannot be underestimated. He is as dedicated as a pilgrim. People said Michael Schumacher would blow him away when the seven-times world champion signed for Mercedes in 2010. Then everyone claimed that Hamilton would be simply too fast for the German, but once again he has stood up to the onslaught from a greater talent. Hamilton, however, must be favourite at this stage. Those who dismiss him as an out and out speedster fail to pay credit to his consummate skill. And despite his emotional nature he is also a tougher cookie than many people give him credit for. But the next two to three months will go a long way to defining his entire career. Behind both drivers there is the formidable team. A leading Mercedes player told the Guardian that a couple of years ago the company \u201chad had enough of a sticky drinks company dominating F1,\u201d referring to Red Bull, and had decided to do whatever was required to bring that epoch of dominance to an end. The results speak for themselves. Behind Hamilton and Rosberg there is much to play for in the final three months of the season. Kimi Raikkonen, with a best finish of sixth, has been a desperate disappointment at Ferrari, albeit in a poor car, and must perform now if he is to dispel speculation that the Italian team might pay off his contract for the second time in his career. Then there is the contest to finish top dog at McLaren, currently an almost unbelievable sixth in the constructors\u2019 championship. McLaren and Honda \u2013 who will be providing the Woking team\u2019s engines next year \u2013 are desperate to make a big signing, with the disillusioned Fernando Alonso a target. Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen may be competing for one place next year, though the likelihood is that both will be retained. After a disappointing season Magnussen has picked up his game in recent races. Further back on the grid, the three-times Le Mans winner Andr\u00e9 Lotterer has replaced Kamui Kobayashi at Caterham for this weekend\u2019s race in Spa. Kobayashi\u2019s drive has been the subject of speculation since Tony Fernandes sold the team earlier in the year. Away from the track, the sport remains in a turmoil of speculation about its future. Bernie Ecclestone is back in charge (he will claim he has never been away) after paying a record \u00a360m to end his bribery trial in Germany. In a separate civil case in London, a high court judge said it was \u201cimpossible to regard [Mr Ecclestone] as a reliable or truthful witness\u201d. It is that, and not what happened in the Munich case that followed, which wounded Ecclestone, who turns 84 in October, badly, and perhaps fatally. The German media group Constantin Medien, which lost that case, is fighting on. \u201cConstantin will pursue every possible legal remedy it has, both in the UK and in Germany, against those responsible for the losses it sustained,\u201d said Keith Oliver, senior partner at Peters &amp; Peters law firm. Constantin alleges that F1\u2019s sale to CVC was undervalued. Donald Mackenzie, the co-founder of the private equity company CVC, which is F1\u2019s largest shareholder with 35%, is being urged by friends and colleagues to sell up. The most likely buyer is Liberty Global and Discovery Communications. It is looking for a 49% stake that would buy out CVC and Lehman Brothers, which owns 14%. But even if CVC remains it could decide to move on from Ecclestone, as some board members are urging. Justin King, 53 and until last month the CEO of Sainsbury\u2019s, would be a favourite. The sport is also in need of a stronger sense of direction from its ruling body, the FIA, according to the majority of teams in the paddock. For now, though, the focus returns to the track."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/22/jenny-agutter-my-family-values-railway-children", "sentences": ["We never stayed anywhere longer than three years, including Cyprus and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-22T11:59:00Z", "title": "Jenny Agutter: My family values", "tags": ["Film", "Parents and parenting", "Grandparents and grandparenting", "Television", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Family", "Life and style", "Jenny Agutter"], "article": "My parents came from very different families \u2013 Dad was an only child from Yorkshire and Mum was one of 10 in an Irish family living in Liverpool. Mum had an awful childhood, which is why she wanted mine and my older brother Jonathan&apos;s to be perfect, which put a lot of pressure on us. We never stayed anywhere longer than three years, including Cyprus and Singapore. Mum and Dad met in Egypt while he was in the army. He was in charge of putting on the entertainment for the forces. Travel was just a natural part of our lives and I didn&apos;t know anything different, so it wasn&apos;t a matter of having to adapt. I sort of didn&apos;t realise I had an extended family because we moved about so much. My aunt and uncle were also in the army so I was rarely in the same country as them, but my aunt is in her 90s now and is just amazing. She was a midwife during the period of Call the Midwife, so she&apos;s been brilliant to talk to. My Irish granny was a pretty hard woman who smoked Player&apos;s cigarettes and drank Guinness and she didn&apos;t get on with my mum terribly well. She remembers being clipped across the back of the head and asking what she&apos;d done that for and being told, &quot;Well if you haven&apos;t done anything naughty, you will soon.&quot; I idolised my brother, who was a toddler when I came along. I&apos;m sure his nose was out of joint when I was born. We were always squabbling. He&apos;d regularly stage mock trials with my teddies and hang them. He&apos;s got a very dry sense of humour, whereas I tend to take things quite seriously, so he knew how to wind me up. Cyprus was the biggest part of my growing up. Mum made us really embrace the local culture wherever we travelled, so we&apos;d go to the local markets, and we had all our clothes made locally too. It was a big culture shock coming back to England to go to boarding school when I was eight. It was wet and green and cold, and I met children who&apos;d lived in the same place all their lives. My school didn&apos;t like me going away for work, so I was only let out for really important parts such as The Railway Children. When I was 16, I left boarding school and we moved to a large modern estate in East Croydon. It was quite strange all being back together. It was a wrench for them to let me go to America when I was 21 to further my career. They wrote me incredibly long letters, which showed me what a loss they felt with me gone. Cystic fibrosis has played a large part in our family. My parents were both carriers [of the gene], my eldest brother died before I was born and I had a younger sister who never even made it out of the hospital. When my brother&apos;s daughter Rachel was born in the late 1970s they were told she wouldn&apos;t reach her 10th birthday because of her health complications. I, too, found out I was a carrier when I became pregnant, but luckily my husband&apos;s tests came back negative. Thankfully, Rachel has pulled through and is now 35 and healthy. I was 37 when I married Johan and got pregnant quickly. I&apos;d almost given up on motherhood and thought I&apos;d lost those maternal instincts. My son Jonathan was born five weeks early on Christmas Day 1990. He was very, very tiny and I was incredibly protective but I didn&apos;t mollycoddle him. I&apos;m a grandparent now as my stepdaughter from Johan&apos;s previous relationship has two children who are 11 and eight. As a grandparent you are given opportunities to see the world fresh again and are in touch with a whole new world. \u2022 Jenny Agutter is an ambassador for the\u00a0Cystic Fibrosis Trust, cysticfibrosis.org.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/22/world-toilet-organization-founder-on-turning-poop-culture-into-pop-culture", "sentences": ["In addition, we will be creating a Shared Sourcing Centre to support back-office services for the entire sector and we are building a $12m, 65,000 ft2 BoP Design Centre in Singapore, which will be ready in two years\u2019 time.", "When Singapore became an independent country, we were poor.", "Today, Singapore has among the highest per capita income in the world.", "We look forward to sharing this model and learning from others at the BoP World Convention &amp; Expo, held from 28 to 30 August in Singapore.", "Jack Sim is the founder of the World Toilet Organization and BoP Hub, a Singapore-based NGO with a vision to design business to end poverty."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-22T12:24:02Z", "title": "World Toilet Organization founder on turning poop culture into pop culture", "tags": [], "article": "Professor Jack Sim founded the World Toilet Organization in 2001 to bring international attention to the importance of sanitation in development. He was instrumental in supporting the United Nations\u2019 plans for the International Year of Sanitation in 2008. In 2013, the United Nations General Assembly adopted 19 November \u2013 the founding date of the World Toilet Organization \u2013 as United Nations World Toilet Day. An Ashoka Global Fellow (2007), a Schwab World Economic Forum Fellow and a Synergos Senior Fellow (2013), Jack founded the BoP Hub in 2011 with the vision of designing business to end poverty. The BoP Hub\u2019s mission is to strengthen cross-sector collaboration in social entrepreneurship in order to serve the 4 billion people who live at the base of the pyramid (BoP). The BoP Hub serves as a gateway for business ventures, technologists and manufacturers to access BoP markets, which the World Bank has estimated are collectively worth US$5 trillion. Click here for more information. Can you tell us a bit about the importance of sanitation and the links this sector has with the BoP market?  Sanitation is one of the central agendas, but it has been neglected for a very long time due to its taboo nature. Most attention and funding went to its more glamorous cousin, water. The two are often bundled as WatSan, but without proper sanitation, water bodies are polluted by open defecation, 1 million children die of diarrhea each year and women are sexually attacked while going to the toilet in the open without privacy. In the end, an unhealthy BoP population cannot be economically productive and the poverty cycle perpetuates. With its unique blend of humor and serious facts, the World Toilet Organization broke the taboo on sanitation and mobilised the global media to cover the subject. After 13 years of effective lobbying, the UN General Assembly unanimously decided last year to adopt the founding day of World Toilet Organization, 19 November, as UN World Toilet Day. We hope that eventually this day can be as popular as Valentine\u2019s Day \u2013 Let\u2019s Love Our Toilet. It\u2019ll care for you if you care for it. It\u2019s a symbiotic relationship. How do you anticipate that emerging technology and investments in sanitation can transform development in the near term? Many useful and affordable sanitation technologies already exist. Twin-pit pour flush toilets, septic tanks, urine diversion dry toilets, bio-gas toilets, terra-preta, black soldier flies and vermiculture are all very useful if adapted to different contexts. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s Reinventing the Toilet program also generated many new technologies for sanitation. However, technology is only a part of the solution. Sanitation is largely a behaviour change challenge. How do we motivate people\u2019s mindsets from centuries of open defecation to using a toilet instead? The rational approach of teaching people to use a toilet for health and hygiene has had limited success. Many toilets given to poor people have become store rooms or are simply not used. To make the real difference, we have to raise the social status of toilets as objects of desire and make having toilets a trendy fashion. To be effective, we need to drive demand for toilets using movie stars, music and peer pressure. The strong aspirational drivers are jealousy, filial piety, love of family, recognition, convenience, privacy and avoidance of embarrassment. We need to use these to create demand and position the toilet at the same level of desire as the cell phone or the TV. In short, we need to turn poop culture into pop culture. On the supply side, we need to create convenient accessibility at affordable prices. The World Toilet Organization\u2019s SaniShop social franchise trains local populations to start small $2,000 (\u00a31205) factories that produce very affordable latrines and shelters, and sell them to the local community. These local entrepreneurs take loans, create jobs and earn profits. Their sales associates \u2013 mostly women \u2013 earn commissions for every toilet sold and this extra income creates gender equality at home too. The training is donated free and the model is self-sustaining once the associates become proficient at promoting and selling. Driving demand and supply at the BoP is done with much empathy, and if done with love, it can be very successful. SaniShop is now in Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Mozambique.  BoP Hub is hosting the inaugural BoP World Convention &amp; Expo to strengthen the BoP ecosystem. Can you tell us a bit more about what you hope to accomplish?   Today, the social development sector is fragmented, as everyone is more or less working in industry- or sector-based silos. The NGOs are often out of money, the social entrepreneurs cannot reach economies of scale, academia disengages after the research is published, the UN makes declarations, the government suffers from \u201cbureaucrazy\u201d, multinational corporations don\u2019t understand last-mile distribution, philanthropists and impact investors see no viable or sustainable business models to invest in, and the poor remain poor. The unemployed are forced to pay a \u2018poverty penalty\u2019 (higher prices) for everything they need to buy. Yet, when we look carefully, all the ingredients for a massive, vibrant and efficient BoP economy are already here if we just map, match and motivate them into proper alignment and collaboration. BoP Hub\u2019s role is to create this alignment and facilitate easy collaboration. Goods and services can be delivered across distribution channels through existing local relationships. Co-buying can create economies of scale for common products. We can function like the Japanese car industry, where all competitors buy common parts. Technologies can go to market at scale if they piggyback on accelerators\u2019 nodes. Vocational training can bring the skills needed for production and export. Government can facilitate business and companies will compete to serve the poor customers because of the $5tn market potential. Through this ecosystem, we can deliver essential goods and services to the BoP cheaper, faster and easier. \u201cA Brave New Marketplace: Unleashing Opportunities at the Base of the Pyramid\u201d, the three-day BoP World Convention &amp; Expo, is the first-ever BoP industry trade show. It will convene leaders and stakeholders from multiple sectors and industries to exchange knowledge, research and policy solutions, and match investors with promising BoP business opportunities. The outcome will be new cross-sector collaborations and sustainable, market-based, inclusive business solutions that integrate this large, untapped market into the global economy as consumers, producers and entrepreneurs.   BoP Hub aims to be one of the global nodes that accelerate ideas to market, scale businesses and develop partnerships for mutual progress. We offer the next year\u2019s BoP World Convention &amp; Expo to any country that might be interested in hosting it. In addition, we will be creating a Shared Sourcing Centre to support back-office services for the entire sector and we are building a $12m, 65,000 ft2 BoP Design Centre in Singapore, which will be ready in two years\u2019 time. This centre will collaboratively design solutions from the idea phase to prototypes, field testing, production, procurement, training programs, dissemination and promotion with partners. The centre will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to serve as a borderless, timeless zone so collaboration can go on continuously around the world.  What do you see as the barriers to mobilising more inclusive business and why is the private sector often unable to meet the vast opportunities? People are afraid to collaborate. NGOs are afraid to lose their donors to partners. Businesses are seen as exploitative and ruthless capitalists. Governments want to help, but rules are rigid and they can\u2019t adapt to needs. However, if the rules are not rigid, corruption creeps in. Development banks cannot make small loans. Knowledge transfers are not efficient and consultants are very expensive. Donors spend too much on due diligence, baseline studies, monitoring and evaluations, and more consultancies and intermediaries until each dollar donated diminishes to only a few cents. The status quo is fragmented, dysfunctional and highly wasteful, and we cannot continue this way anymore. Poor people can only get out of poverty if we include them in our formal economy. We must allow all forms of business to take place and not define them too narrowly so that we do not stifle innovation. I know we can end global poverty because I\u2019ve been there before. When Singapore became an independent country, we were poor. We did not have our own energy, water or food sources. In fact, we had nothing but people and a seaport. But we did not rely on charity. We got out of poverty by becoming a country that was open for business. We invested in clean water and sanitation to build a healthy, productive workforce for investors. Today, Singapore has among the highest per capita income in the world. We look forward to sharing this model and learning from others at the BoP World Convention &amp; Expo, held from 28 to 30 August in Singapore.

In the wake of Tom Hardy&apos;s improbably spectacular performance in Locke (Lionsgate, 15), perhaps &quot;I&apos;d watch him negotiate a concrete delivery while stuck behind the wheel of a BMW on the M6&quot; should become the new standard. Hardy&apos;s sonorous grace and brute presence make every minute of Steven Knight&apos;s ultra-minimalist domestic drama compelling, though the film never quite shakes its air of high-level actorly exercise. Bearded and mellifluously Welsh-accented, tattoos buried under a snug dad jumper, Hardy plays a family man and construction manager whose personal and professional lives go awry in calamitous unison over the course of a night-time drive from Birmingham to London. There, a former one-night stand (voiced by the ever-welcome Olivia Colman) is giving birth to his child; from the driver&apos;s seat, he breaks the news over the phone to his wife (Ruth Wilson) and young sons. Nearly 90 minutes of real-time emotional distress ensues, without Locke leaving the car \u2013 effectively a radio play with sleek, cat&apos;s-eye-stained visuals. Knight&apos;s somewhat contrived writing never answers the question of why a decent man would choose to handle this crisis in such coldly cack-handed fashion, but Hardy&apos;s exquisite, tender-tough performance fills in the gaps. I believed the wounded family dynamic more in Singaporean director Anthony Chen&apos;s lovely, lightly handled debut Ilo Ilo (Soda, 12), in which the overworked parents of a difficult 10-year-old boy feel gradually threatened by their son&apos;s substantial bond with his Filipina nanny. Chen regards this fractured household with unimpeachable fairness and compassion; it&apos;s a moving, sometimes mordantly funny miniature that deserved its laurels at Cannes last year. I&apos;m less inclined to say the same for Heli (Network, 18), Amat Escalante&apos;s pristinely composed but grimly unilluminating shock-treatment\u00a0study of Mexican drug-trade violence, which uses one hand for moral finger-wagging and the other to set certain unfortunates&apos; genitals on fire. It&apos;s bravura stuff in one sense, but lacks the drive of the comparable, superior Miss Bala.     The \u2018unimpeachable\u2019 Ilo Ilo.    Hundreds of films will be shortly be unleashed into the wild at the Toronto film festival, some to enviable levels of acclaim. More, however, will be ignobly discarded and Arthur and Mike (Arrow, 15) is as good a cautionary tale as any. A deadeningly faux-quirky road romance between two curiously bland oddballs played by Colin Firth and Emily Blunt, it took two years to reach the UK following its Toronto premiere and still feels too soon. It leaves a kind of air-freshener aftertaste easily removed by the salty, sassy pleasures of drag-queen documentary I Am Divine (Peccadillo, 15), a loving, self-explanatory portrait of John Waters&apos;s muse. At the other end of the scale, there&apos;s a wealth of austere brilliance in the week&apos;s most essential Blu-ray boxset, the Kelly Reichardt Collection (Soda, 15). Handily collating the four previous features of America&apos;s current leading poet of rural humanism (her woozy 1994 debut, River of Grass, is nestled amid the bonus features), it&apos;s an invaluable primer for the forthcoming Night Moves. Netflix&apos;s latest additions include some essential 2013 catch-up material: if you&apos;re somehow still lagging on Jane Campion&apos;s shimmering Kiwi-noir Top of the Lake or the ecstatic romance of Blue is the Warmest Colour, your range of excuses just got smaller. It&apos;s likelier, however, that you might have missed Journal de France, a wistful, autumnal record of the 50-year career of French photographer and film-maker Raymond Depardon, centred on a recent, rambling caravan trek across provincial France. Documenting a life and landscape that seem to be winding down together, it&apos;s a road trip as languid as Tom Hardy&apos;s is panicked."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/25/daniel-ricciardo-formula-one-belgian-grand-prix", "sentences": ["\u201cMonza we know will be tricky again, but obviously the package we brought here was pretty racy, so, try and take something from here to Monza and then I think Singapore and Suzuka will be pretty good for us.\u201d While the Mercedes drivers clashed again on Sunday, Ricciardo said he is happy with his team-mate, the four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who trails him 58 points."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-25T02:18:13Z", "title": "Daniel Ricciardo says he is still in Formula One title hunt", "tags": ["Formula One", "Formula One 2014", "Motor sport", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "Daniel Ricciardo says he is not out of the race for the Formula One drivers\u2019 championship after Sunday\u2019s win at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Our response to any request from the United States, or other close allies and partners, will be based on whether there is an achievable overall humanitarian purpose and a clear and proportionate role for Australia as well as on a careful assessment of the risks. \u201cAustralia is not considering putting combat forces on the ground; nor, for that matter, is the United States.\u201d It is understood the Labor opposition has not received a briefing on the latest developments.  The deputy leader of the Australian Greens, Adam Bandt, said Abbott must bring the matter to parliament for debate. \u201cThe public and parliamentarians should not be finding out about potential Australian military involvement from US newspapers,\u201d Bandt said. \u201cThe Greens have been raising concerns about \u2018mission creep\u2019 for some time now.\u201d In parliament on Tuesday, Bandt sought a specific assurance from Abbott that troop deployments would be debated by MPs. The prime minister stopped short of promising a parliamentary debate but said he would not commit forces without \u201cthe fullest possible consideration\u201d, cabinet discussion, and consultation with the opposition. At the time Abbott praised Obama for authorising air strikes to halt the advance of the Isis movement and said talks were continuing \u201cbetween the US and its close partners on what can best be done to continue to relieve the humanitarian situation in northern Iraq\u201d. Heval Syan, a representative of the Kurdistan regional government (KRG) in Iraq, urged Australia to provide support to the Peshmerga with humanitarian assistance and military support, in a letter to the foreign minister, Julie Bishop. \u201cDeliveries of the military equipment and ammunitions are urgently needed for Peshmerga to achieve gains on the ground,\u201d said the letter from Syan. \u201cIt is now time for the international community especially the Australiangovernment to step forward urgently and provide the KRG with humanitarian assistance and military support, particularly equipment and air support.\u201d Seven nations have joined the US and Iraq in pledging to arm Kurdish forces in their fight against the Islamic State, despite concerns about bolstering Kurdish separatism in the region. Albania, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Italy, France and the UK had \u201ccommitted to helping provide Kurdish forces urgently needed arms and equipment\u201d, said the US defence secretary, Chuck Hagel, on Tuesday. Earlier this month Abbott announced that two C-130 Hercules aircraft based in the United Arab Emirates would be available to carry out food and supply drops in the region. \u201cWe believe that Australian government can do more than that by supporting the Kurds through the humanitarian assistance, military support, particularly equipment and ammunitions and air support,\u201d Syan wrote to Bishop. Bishop was questioned by her opposition counterpart, Tanya Plibersek, on whether she had received the letter, after Bishop said specifically in an ABC radio interview on Wednesday morning that she had not been asked by Kurdistan to supply weapons. Bishop referred Plibersek to a Sky News interview she had done earlier that afternoon but which had not yet aired, and said she had investigated the matter, discovering the letter was sent to her office on the 18 August when she was in Singapore. \u201cBecause it did not come from an accredited diplomat or a nation state it was sent to the lawyers to consider the status of the letter,\u201d Bishop told parliament. \u201cI was not aware of the letter this morning. I was aware of the request that had been considered by a national security committee.\u201d During the Sky interview, Bishop said the Australian government had received a number of requests including from the Kurds, and it was currently working through the request to see how the Kurdish government could work with the Iraqi government. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to look at humanitarian support and that is what we\u2019re providing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnything further would be the subject of considerable discussion within national security.\u201d Bishop would not be drawn on whether Australia was considering the request for weapons, or whether the US or Iraq had made a request."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/aug/28/singapore-digital-marketing-differences", "sentences": ["The city-state of Singapore may be very small in absolute terms, but commercially there\u2019s no question it punches above its weight.", "Singapore sets out to attract companies with a safe business environment, significant tax breaks and its perception as a relatively safe and stable country in a region that can still be volatile in places \u2013 recent events in Thailand being a case in point.", "Singapore has been very active in promoting a multiracial society and most people are very supportive of this.", "Major local businesses abound \u2013 including Singapore Airlines, Tiger Beer and Singtel, all of which have expanded without bringing in lots of expats in to manage them.", "The role and value of marketing Marketing in Singapore is twofold: marketing within Singapore itself and its use by brands as an Asian regional hub.", "The former crosses wide-ranging sectors, as Singapore is a major market for financial services and tourism.", "It\u2019s also seen as a reliable medical destination, as demand for health and medicines is growing and Singapore has positioned itself as a centre for care.", "Looking at Singapore as a regional marketing hub, digital technologies are making a huge difference to how brands work across Asia.", "Key trends in marketing and media Singapore is a marketing capability case study in its own right in how it positions itself in the region.", "And when it comes to Singapore\u2019s own global brands, some of these have developed world-class campaigns that have secured international acclaim, while being built around very Singaporean themes.", "As an example, Singaporeans feel a strong affinity for their hawker food (outdoor cooked food courts), which is culturally very important.", "The competition narrowed it down to three stalls and challenged Gordon Ramsay to cook a favourite Singaporean dish as an \u201cus against them\u201d \u2013 and the local chefs won!", "People, culture and behaviour As noted above, given Singapore\u2019s primary function as a regional hub \u2013 Monday to Thursday many professionals spend a great deal of time travelling around Asia.", "It\u2019s thus quite hard to view Singapore in isolation culturally."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-28T13:47:36Z", "title": "Taming the tiger: marketing in Singapore", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network"], "article": "The city-state of Singapore may be very small in absolute terms, but commercially there\u2019s no question it punches above its weight. Often referred to as one of the four Asian Tigers, a recent PwC report said that it is set to replace Switzerland as the wealth management capital of the world by 2015. Significantly, it is the Asian regional hub for a huge range of multinationals, and a reason why Brand Learning selected it as its third international office. Singapore sets out to attract companies with a safe business environment, significant tax breaks and its perception as a relatively safe and stable country in a region that can still be volatile in places \u2013 recent events in Thailand being a case in point. It offers a professional, well-educated, well-travelled population. A meeting there is usually no different to one in London or New York, without any of the cultural differences of places like Japan, and English is the first language when doing business. Singapore has been very active in promoting a multiracial society and most people are very supportive of this. There are naturally some tensions under the surface, due to the large population of immigrant workers and a government that has high standards (you can get arrested for littering), but they don\u2019t greatly affect business. However, it\u2019s not just about attracting global firms. Major local businesses abound \u2013 including Singapore Airlines, Tiger Beer and Singtel, all of which have expanded without bringing in lots of expats in to manage them. And as might be expected, its banking sector is enormously strong with both global players and local institutions like DBS and the Overseas Development Bank of China. The role and value of marketing Marketing in Singapore is twofold: marketing within Singapore itself and its use by brands as an Asian regional hub. The former crosses wide-ranging sectors, as Singapore is a major market for financial services and tourism. It\u2019s also seen as a reliable medical destination, as demand for health and medicines is growing and Singapore has positioned itself as a centre for care. Local marketing is reasonably advanced, reflecting the well-educated and travelled population. There is high internet and smartphone penetration and a lot of expatriates \u2013 both western and Asian \u2013 are based there. While the big global firms traditionally brought in a lot of western expats, this has become much less prevalent \u2013 they\u2019re now looking more to Asian nations like India and China to recruit. Looking at Singapore as a regional marketing hub, digital technologies are making a huge difference to how brands work across Asia. It\u2019s the primary channel in China; more than 78% of South Koreans use smartphones (a staggering 97% of 18- to 24-year-olds); and the Philippines is the world champion for SMS users. That said, pan-Asian marketers have to wrestle with the fact that there is also a large and unsophisticated rural market as opposed to purely urban city audiences: in other words, there are bottom-of-pyramid consumers as well as more sophisticated ones. This leads to different types of communication, such as a heavy use of TV for rural audiences and a much higher use of mobile overall. It\u2019s not about changing brand strategy but leveraging different channels appropriately to the target consumers. Key trends in marketing and media Singapore is a marketing capability case study in its own right in how it positions itself in the region. In consumer marketing, it has created a brand reputation for tourism, building two major casinos in the last few years, a world-class indoor garden (Gardens by the Bay), upgrading its zoo, acquiring an aquarium and even constructing a \u201cUniversal Studios\u201d. It has cleverly marketed itself as a unique destination for Asian tourists, targeting the new rising middle class looking for world-class experiences. It is positioned as the place to come for facilities, entertainment and shopping in particular \u2013 with a retail environment that consists of huge malls designed to excite and entice shoppers. And when it comes to Singapore\u2019s own global brands, some of these have developed world-class campaigns that have secured international acclaim, while being built around very Singaporean themes. As an example, Singaporeans feel a strong affinity for their hawker food (outdoor cooked food courts), which is culturally very important. Singtel even set up a challenge to vote for the best local hawker food store, getting 2.5 million votes out of a population of 5 million. The competition narrowed it down to three stalls and challenged Gordon Ramsay to cook a favourite Singaporean dish as an \u201cus against them\u201d \u2013 and the local chefs won! And clearly when it comes to B2B marketing, the capabilities cultivated by the government in attracting businesses to the region are world-beating. People, culture and behaviour As noted above, given Singapore\u2019s primary function as a regional hub \u2013 Monday to Thursday many professionals spend a great deal of time travelling around Asia. It\u2019s thus quite hard to view Singapore in isolation culturally. However, some trends have become evident: \u2022 It is a small city with a huge population \u2013 everyone knows each other and networking is hugely valuable. It\u2019s worth spending time face to face and investing in relationships; it\u2019s one of the few global locations where it is actually possible to squeeze in six external meetings in one day, such is the geography and efficiency of the infrastructure. \u2022 People are very keen to meet and learn from colleagues. Even really senior people tend to welcome you warmly, whether they\u2019re expats or local. \u2022 However there is a much longer purchase cycle than in the West, so people have to be patient and invest in relationships \u2013 business does not happen overnight \u2013 respect must be earned. \u2022 There is always a war for talent and therefore a need for creating common ways of working and investing in people development as a lever for retention, but it\u2019s not as extreme as in China or Indonesia.

Speaking as the UN prepares to debate a new set of development goals \u2013 and in the aftermath of the rape and murder of two Indian girls who were attacked as they ventured into a field to relieve themselves \u2013 Eliasson said failure to address the issue of sanitation would prove disastrous for a third of humanity. \u201cSanitation is cross-cutting: if you make progress on sanitation, then you dramatically improve the achievement of at least four other goals,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOne of the main reasons for child mortality is diarrhoea and dysentery because of bad water and a lack of sanitation. You get a much better way of working with maternal health issues: I can\u2019t tell you how many women are dying in childbirth because of a lack of clean water. You\u2019ll affect education, because people can\u2019t go to school when they have these huge problems, and you will have productive people who can go to work.\u201d Eliasson said building toilets for women was fundamental to gender equality, education \u2013 and safety. \u201cIn Africa, in particular, there is an unfortunate situation where girls don\u2019t have toilets in their schools,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to arrange them for the boys, but girls require more privacy. And then you get into the area that we saw in that horrible example in India, when the girls went out at night and were raped and killed. This is done in innumerable cases: men preying on young girls who are going out like that.\u201d         According to the UN, 2.5 billion people still lack \u201cimproved sanitation facilities\u201d \u2013 defined as ones that \u201chygienically separate human excreta from human contact\u201d, down only 7% since 1990, when 2.7 billion lacked access, and more than a billion people \u2013 most of whom live in rural areas \u2013 have to defecate in gutters, behind bushes or into water. More people have access to mobile phones than toilets, it says. \u201cThis, for me, is one of the most drastic and sad examples of the loss of dignity: allowing 1.1 billion people in 22 countries to practise open defecation,\u201d said Eliasson. \u201cApart from the human dignity aspect, there is the health aspect and the environmental aspect.\u201d Eliasson, a former chairman of WaterAid Sweden, said he was driven to speak out by memories of the children he had seen die from diarrhoea, dysentery and dehydration. \u201cIt\u2019s a very concrete challenge and it\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to do something about it.\u201d Although he was heartened to see governments belatedly waking up to the importance of sanitation, progress has been far too slow. The millennium development goal (MDG) on sanitation \u2013 which aims to halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to basic sanitation by the end of next year \u2013 is unlikely to be met, he said. \u201cI think we have seen progress on water, although there are still 780 million people without safe water. But I am sad to say that we have not seen the same pace of progress on sanitation. On the contrary, I would say the sanitation goal is one of the most lagging of all the goals, and that is why we have tried our best to speed up the work for achieving it by the end of next year.\u201d He said the fact that sanitation and water are likely to have their own standalone place among the sustainable development goals (SDG), which will succeed the MDGs, was \u201ca sad confirmation\u201d of international inaction. But he said he was at least encouraged to see it was already a high priority; during the formulation of the MDGs it had to be added by a specific resolution. Age-old taboos around toilets and defecation, he added, were finally breaking down. He pointed to India, where the new prime minister, Narendra Modi, tackled the issue during his election campaign, calling on the nation to build \u201ctoilets first and temples later\u201d.         In sub-Saharan Africa, too, the issue is increasingly on the agenda. In July, the prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2013 a state blighted by sexual violence \u2013 told the Guardian provision of toilets had a direct bearing on education and gender equality. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about classrooms, you also need toilets, and providing toilets for boys and toilets for girls limits the risk of girls being attacked when they go to the toilet,\u201d said Augustin Matata Ponyo. \u201cAnd that provision encourages parents to send their children to school, because they feel reassured that those toilets mean their daughters won\u2019t be attacked.\u201d Eliasson said he would be very surprised if water, sanitation and hygiene did not figure \u201cvery highly\u201d in the SDGs. \u201c[It\u2019s] such a good investment: invest in sanitation and you will have concrete results with positive changes for people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cThe economic losses are tremendous and the economic gains are enormous.\u201d He said the focus now needed to switch from rural areas to urban ones as more and more people leave their traditional ways of life in search of opportunities in towns and cities where no infrastructure exists. \u201cIt\u2019s most often the poor people who move into the urban, sprawling areas of poor countries, and the infrastructure does not exist, and the collective water and sanitation arrangements are not made,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have the big risks of outbreaks of diarrhoea and dysentery.\u201d Asked what the consequences of any further inaction would be for the hundreds of millions of people still in desperate need of a clean and safe place to defecate, he was blunt: \u201cThey would be disastrous. We simply have to do this.\u201d \u2018A world of toilets for all\u2019 The international coalition seeking to break the taboos around the twin issues of toilet provision and open defecation is an unlikely one, comprising among others, a 73-year-old Swedish diplomat, the government of Singapore and a bright green Sesame Street resident by the name of Raya. Eliasson has long campaigned for improved sanitation. Sometimes, he reflects, undiplomatic language is called for. \u201cI remember I finished a speech once, where the original text was, \u2018We have to work for a life of dignity for all\u2019. And that was code language for sanitation,\u201d he says. \u201cI changed that line to: \u2018We have to work for a world of toilets for all\u2019. I can tell you, there were lots of raised eyebrows and confusion in the translators\u2019 booths.\u201d Eliasson says things have moved on since, especially as the term open defecation \u2013 \u201cwhich is a euphemism in itself\u201d \u2013 entered diplomatic discourse. Credit, he says, must also go to Singapore, which last year successfully proposed that the UN designate 19 November as World Toilet Day as a way of focusing global attention on sanitation issues.     Toilets at a petrol station near Accra, Ghana. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Last but not least is Raya, whose brief is to teach children in Bangladesh, India and Nigeria about the importance of proper toilet habits. \u201cWe need more toilets,\u201d she told the UN in May. \u201cWith more toilets in schools and pledges around the world, we can stop millions of children and grown-ups from getting sick.

His diary dissecting Maoism and the cultural revolution, Les Habits Neufs du Pr\u00e9sident Mao (The Chairman&apos;s New Clothes, 1971), echoed the title of the Hans Christian Andersen fable and made its thesis plain in its first few words. The cultural revolution, he said, had nothing revolutionary about it except the name and nothing cultural about it except the initial tactical pretext: &quot;It was a power struggle waged at the top between a handful of men and behind the smokescreen of a fictitious mass movement.&quot; This pioneering attack on the cultural revolution and its associated mythology did not initially create a great stir, even in France, where the cult of Mao had reached rare heights. Le Monde gave it a brief and condescending mention, saying that, while some facts were accurately reported, there were mistakes and information that could not be checked. Sources, it said, were not usually quoted and the author clearly had no experience of that of which he spoke. Others were less charitable, accusing Ryckmans of being a CIA agent, and the book became steadily more controversial, the more so when a later volume, Ombres Chinoises (1974, translated as Chinese Shadows, 1976), appeared, in which Ryckmans made plain his contempt for the gullible but ignorant self-appointed sinophiles who were treated to visits to China during which they were shown nothing of the real life of the masses with whom they felt such empathy. Born in Brussels, he studied law and art history at the Catholic University of Louvain. His contact with China began when he was 19, one of a delegation of young Belgians invited to the country on a trip that included a meeting with Zhou Enlai, the premier under Mao. As he put it: &quot;My overwhelming impression (a conclusion to which I remained faithful for the rest of my life) was that it would be inconceivable to live in this world, in our age, without a good knowledge of Chinese language and a direct access to Chinese culture.&quot; To that end, he spent 12 years in the far east, in particular Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, where he became an acknowledged expert on Chinese painting, calligraphy and poetry. In Hong Kong he monitored the Chinese press on behalf of Belgian diplomats. He was invited to teach at the Australian National University in Canberra in 1970, and adopted his pen name for his first book so that he would be able to re-enter China. In 1972, he was given a six-month attachment to the Belgian embassy in Beijing, an experience that provided the material for Chinese Shadows. But then a fellow sinologist identified Simon Leys as Ryckmans, thereby ruling out any further return to the country whose culture and people he venerated. He later taught at the University of Sydney, and continued to write. Fluent in French, English and Chinese, he had a wide intellectual hinterland, including authors as varied as George Orwell, GK Chesterton and the 20th-century Chinese writer Lu Xun. He was fascinated by the sea and wrote a well-received account of a 17th-century nautical disaster, The Wreck of the Batavia (2005). His novella The Death of Napoleon (1991) was filmed as The Emperor&apos;s New Clothes, with Ian Holm in the title role. The play on the Andersen title this time referred to an imposter remaining imprisoned on St Helena while Napoleon returned to Paris, but Ryckmans was disappointed by the production. He was not afraid of controversy and had a well-publicised row with the late Christopher Hitchens in the New York Review of Books over comments Hitchens made about Mother Teresa. Ryckmans lived in Australia for more than four decades, but retained his Belgian nationality. He is survived by his Taiwanese wife, Hanfang Chang, three sons and a daughter. \u2022 Pierre Ryckmans (Simon Leys), scholar of China and writer, born 28 September 1935; died 11 August 2014"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/aug/29/small-island-states-climate-change-sea-level", "sentences": ["From the multi-billion dollar economy of Singapore, to Papua New Guinea, one of the least explored countries in the world where 1,000 cultural groups are thought to exist, to the very remote Niue, which is one of the world\u2019s largest coral islands \u2013 each small island developing state is endowed with its own unique attributes."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-29T14:07:55Z", "title": "Help small island states win their battle against climate change", "tags": ["Climate change", "Environment", "Sea level", "Oceans", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "World news", "United Nations", "Global climate talks", "Sustainable development", "Environmental sustainability"], "article": "Many of the planet\u2019s most prized destinations, places considered exquisite and idyllic, where nature seems bountiful and people appear at ease, are under threat. In less than a decade, climate change-induced sea level rise could force thousands of people to migrate from some of the world\u2019s 52 small island developing states (Sids). How Sids respond to threats such as sea level rise, and the degree of support they receive, is indicative of how we, collectively, will adapt to a host of climate change impacts in the coming decades. When we think of Sids, we may be tempted to imagine small patches of paradise scattered with lightly populated fishing villages, unfettered by the demands of modernity. In fact, almost one in every 100 of us is from a small island developing state. Sids boast a diversity of cultures, natural resources, biodiversity, and indigenous knowledge that makes them mainstays of our planetary ecosystem. From the multi-billion dollar economy of Singapore, to Papua New Guinea, one of the least explored countries in the world where 1,000 cultural groups are thought to exist, to the very remote Niue, which is one of the world\u2019s largest coral islands \u2013 each small island developing state is endowed with its own unique attributes. Yet what they increasingly share in common are escalating environmental threats that are further aggravated by economic insecurities. Sea level rise is among the most daunting of these threats, which in some regions is up to four times the global average. According to recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates, if average global temperatures increase by approximately 4C, sea levels could rise as much as one metre by 2100, a scenario that would see nations such as Kiribati, Maldives, Marshall Islands and Tuvalu become uninhabitable, while a large share of the population of many other Sids could be displaced or otherwise. What makes this situation even more grievous is that the climate change threats facing many Sids are by-and-large not of their own making. Their total combined annual carbon dioxide output, although rising, accounts for less than 1% of global emissions. Sids are suffering disproportionately from acts of environmental negligence of which we are collectively guilty. Larger economies, until recently, have managed better than small ones to mask the impacts of exhausting their natural capital and contributing heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, but the consequences of this neglect are catching up with them too.     A girl sits on a log next to the roots of a tree near the village of Teaoraereke on South Tarawa in the central Pacific island nation of Kiribati. The country consists of a chain of 33 atolls and islands that stand just metres above sea level. Photograph: David Gray/Reuters    Responses to these threats that apply the business-as-usual economic models that have brought them to the state of economic and environmental vulnerability they are in today will be temporary at best, and catastrophic at worst. That is why Sids are beginning to take the first steps on a blue-green economy transition \u2013 a strategy that targets resource efficiency and clean technology, is carbon neutral and socially inclusive, will provide a healthy environment and help conserve resources, while integrating traditional knowledge and giving priority to island community and culture that will build their resilience to the impacts of climate change. But we should not look at climate change threats in isolation from other influenced by human activities, because climate change is in fact exacerbating problems that we have already created, such as desertification, biodiversity loss, and food insecurity. Take the degradation of marine ecosystems as an example. A number of studies show that it is overfishing that currently outweighs all other human impacts on marine ecosystems, including climate change. With Sids accounting for seven out of 10 of the world\u2019s countries most dependent on fish and seafood consumption, reducing emissions alone will not be enough to ensure a sufficient supply of fish in the future. The governments of these small island states are recognising that many policies of the past have left them ill-prepared to respond to the impacts of climate change, and it is this awareness that is motivating them to make sustainable economic growth the cornerstone of their development. The energy sector, where they are leading the switch to renewables, is a prime example of necessity driving innovation and change. On average, Pacific island households spend approximately 20% of their household income on energy, and can often pay up to 400% more per kilowatt-hour of electricity than the United States. As a result, many states are now developing their domestic renewable energy markets. For instance, the small South Pacific island of Tokelau is close to meeting 100% of its energy needs through renewables \u2013 even powering generators with locally produced coconut biofuel. And Barbados, already the leading producer of solar water heaters in the Caribbean, is set to save an estimated $283.5m (\u00a3171m) through a 29% switch to renewables by 2029. From valuing and managing their natural resources, to putting the right incentives in place to switch to renewable energy, Sids are leading the blue-green economy transition. And next week, at the third international conference on Sids in Samoa, they will reaffirm their commitment to advancing national sustainable development goals in front of a global audience. What they need from the rest of the world is the solidarity, technologies, and resources to act on that commitment on a scale that will radically change their fortunes. It is hoped that the new international climate change agreement currently being negotiated, and which will be adopted at the Paris conference in 2015, might help to relieve some of their economic burden of adapting to the impacts of climate change, while also reducing the severity of the impacts by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Supporting Sids on this journey of transition provides an unprecedented opportunity to be part of game-changing socioeconomic solutions that can be applied in broader contexts and bigger economies. We should look upon Sids as microcosms of our larger society, and not stand back and allow them to grapple with a threat for which they are largely inculpable."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/aug/29/malaysia-airlines-cuts-6000-jobs", "sentences": ["But they have got stiff competition from budget rivals Air Asia and Air Asia X, quality neighbouring airlines like Singapore, and the Gulf carriers."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-29T16:43:00Z", "title": "Malaysia Airlines cuts 6,000 jobs", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "Malaysia", "Asia Pacific", "Business"], "article": "Malaysia Airlines is to slash its staff numbers by a third, cutting 6,000 jobs, after the airline suffered the two worst disasters in modern aviation only five months apart. The carrier had been struggling financially even before the disasters that beset it this year, starting with the unexplained disappearance of flight MH370 with 239 people aboard in March. The airline&apos;s name became synonymous with disaster after a second major tragedy in July, when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine, killing 298 passengers and crew. The 6,000 job losses announced in Kuala Lumpur on Friday are part of a major restructuring of the airline, including the appointment of a new chief executive by next year. The state announced plans to take full ownership of its 77-year-old flag carrier after trading in the airline&apos;s shares was suspended last month, when it was valued at less than 15% of its 2012 peak. Currently Malaysia&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, Khazanah Nasional, is the 69% majority owner, and plans to buy out other shareholders at a premium. Malaysia Airlines will also review its routes, after flying with high numbers of empty seats on many of its planes. The airline has been adding flight capacity and slashing fares to get customers aboard, meaning overall passenger numbers have only dropped by 0.3% year on year. Revenue dropped 5% in the three months from April to June even as available seats rose 9% from 2013. The full effect on sales has yet to be seen as the airline offered full refunds to passengers who had booked to fly later in the year after the shooting down of MH17. One route that will continue is the twice-daily service between Heathrow and Kuala Lumpur, a high-capacity service operated with Malaysia&apos;s Airbus A380 superjumbo. A London-based Malaysia Airlines spokesman said: &quot;The London-Kuala Lumpur route is highly successful and will carry on. Today&apos;s announcement is all about rebuilding the airline after these two awful incidents. The airline is being reshaped and the aim is to return it to profitability.&quot; Analysts anticipate that Malaysia&apos;s restructuring could extend to selling off its engineering, airport services or budget airline units.           Not all of Malaysia&apos;s staff may be unwilling to leave the airline: it emerged this week that almost 200 cabin crew had already quit this year, citing family pressure and fear of flying after the two disasters, which claimed the lives of 27 crew. Unions reported that those who remained were often working extended hours due to staff shortages. Sales have been hit hard since March, with customers from China deserting the airline after the disappearance of MH370, which was carrying 152 Chinese citizens among the 227 passengers presumed to have died. The airline lost \u00a358.5m in the last quarter, putting it on track to exceed the \u00a3222m loss it recorded in 2013. John Strickland, of the independent aviation consultancy JLS Consulting, said turning around Malaysia Airlines&apos; fortunes was not impossible but &quot;a very steep mountain to climb&quot;. He added: &quot;It&apos;s not going to be a quick fix. On one hand, they should be well placed: they are in an extremely buoyant market in Asia. But they have got stiff competition from budget rivals Air Asia and Air Asia X, quality neighbouring airlines like Singapore, and the Gulf carriers. &quot;They face all these current challenges on top of a lengthy history of being overmanned and suffering state interference. They have to reduce their operations, take capacity out of the market where it&apos;s not profitable, and overcome the public reaction to these incidents: to show they are compassionate and restore confidence that they are nothing but safety focused as an airline.&quot; An intensive underwater search for MH370 will resume next month, after the mapping of a 34,000sq mile area of the southern Indian Ocean floor by two survey ships. The Boeing 777 disappeared on 8 March en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A broad international search operation revealed no physical trace of the plane, but analysis of satellite signals has led authorities to believe it crashed in the sea west of Australia. Dutch investigators are expected to issue an interim report soon on the MH17 crash in eastern Ukraine. It is believed that pro-Russian separatists fired the missile that brought down another Malaysian Boeing 777 plane, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/30/poached-recipes-pear-salad-oyster-lettuce-readers-recipe-swap", "sentences": ["Hainanese chicken rice This dish was brought to Malaysia and Singapore by Chinese immigrants from the island province of Hainan."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-30T05:00:04Z", "title": "Readers\u2019 recipe swap: Poached | Eve O\u2019Sullivan", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "This week\u2019s theme produced a hugely varied set of recipes, from new twists on fruity puddings to Jenny Barrett\u2019s ultimate in surf and turf.

With his dark hair swept to the side and bee-stung lips, Cambodian painter Chov Theanly is often told he\u2019s the dapper doppelganger of the country\u2019s most well-known crooner, the late Sinn Sisamouth, the Frank Sinatra of Cambodia during the 60s, the country\u2019s golden age. When Khmer Rouge soldiers marched through Cambodia\u2019s cities in 1975, sending its people to oppressive labour camps, film stars and musicians were some of the brutal regime\u2019s first targets and, like many of his peers, Sisamouth disappeared. But today, almost 40 years later, the arts are thriving once again, and no more so than in Battambang, a dreamy, peaceful city between the capital Phnom Penh and tourist mecca Siem Reap. While construction has rocketed along at breakneck speeds elsewhere, Battambang has, despite being the country\u2019s second-largest city, remained relatively untainted by tourism and mass development. The Sankae river snakes through town, while rice fields, leafy villages and glittering pagodas halo around its edges. I meet 28-year-old Theanly at a small, artist-run space called Sammaki in the middle of town for an informal art tour. A graphic designer and painter who works from a cool, airy attic above his father\u2019s Chinese shophouse on the riverbank, Theanly is one of a wave of home-grown artists enjoying recent success \u2013 his exhibition, entitled Surviving, sold out on its opening night in Phnom Penh last year. \u201cEverything is just very open and creative and collaborative in Battambang,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere\u2019s an honesty here.\u201d         Perhaps at the core of the city\u2019s artistic revival is the visual arts centre Phare Ponleu Selpak. The sprawling arts school teaches visual, applied and performing arts, provides a formal state education curriculum for almost 1,000 students and welcomes tourists through its gates almost every day of the year, with a circus troupe performance twice a week in the bright big top tent. Phare\u2019s visual arts graduates are now opening their own contemporary art galleries, studios and workshops, and we visit artist-curator Mao Soviet who runs Make Maek, and the newly opened artist-collective space called Studio Art Battambang. It\u2019s a cavernous old shophouse that exhibits large, bamboo sculptures and huge canvases. We pop next door to refuel at Kinyei, a social enterprise cafe with probably the best coffee in Cambodia (try a piccolo or a \u201cCambodian street latte\u201d with palm sugar and orange essence). On Theanly\u2019s suggestion I head to another social enterprise eatery for dinner, the innovative Jaan Bai, on Street 2. With Bangkok-based celebrity chef David Thompson involved in the set-up and menu design, it\u2019s a fun spot to unwind \u2013 local artists were commissioned to create a huge, psychedelic mural on the restaurant\u2019s outside wall and the menu is designed for sharing. Head chef Mohm trained intensively with Thompson at the Bangkok Nahm and the menu reflects this \u2013 there\u2019s a delicious Thai green curry, a finger-licking good dish of crab from the seaside hamlet Kep with Kampot pepper with chilli jam and a fiery kick. Cocktails have a Khmer twist \u2013 try the dragonfruit caipirinha and the lemongrass bloody mary.     The terrace at Jaan Bai restaurant    Besides the contemporary art scene, Battambang\u2019s striking architecture adds to its allure. To the north of town lies the magnificent Sala Khaet, the old Governor\u2019s Residence. In 1905 the last Thai \u201clord governor\u201d, Chhum Aphaiwong, hired Italian architects to erect this sweeping European-style palace. Elsewhere, French colonial villas and art deco structures rub shoulders with striking modernist \u201cNew Khmer\u201d buildings erected during the 1960s. The influence of China is evident too \u2013 one good example is at Lotus, a sleek restaurant-cum-gallery in a three-storey Chinese shophouse, painstakingly restored by Battambang expat Darren Swallow. While the restaurant serves middle-eastern fare \u2013 house-made hummus, baba ganoush, Iraqi-style laffe flatbread, couscous and lentil salads \u2013 the second floor hosts art exhibits and screens independent films and documentaries. I venture out of town on my last day and join a half-day cycling tour with Soksabike, another community project set up by Kinyei cafe. It\u2019s a 30km loop around the villages and gives us a glimpse into the various agricultural industries \u2013 rice paper production, dried fruits, rice liquor and prahok (fermented fish paste) are some \u2013 that support Battambang\u2019s economy.     Cycling tour with Soksabike, a community project    Weaving along palm-fringed roads in the early morning haze is a dreamy experience. We continue down red-dirt roads, through a maze of bamboo trees and lush countryside. Women with checked kramas (cotton scarves) wrapped around their heads smile and wave at us. Later, we see women wearing hijabs in a rainbow of colours do the same. This north-western area is home to many Muslim Cham villages, and is studded with ornate mosques. This melting pot of cultures, ethnicities and religions, plus the juxtaposition of old and new, is what Theanly finds captivating about Battambang, and something he thinks makes it a great spot for creativity. \u201cMy aunt grew up in this town in the 1960s,\u201d he says. \u201cShe always tells me stories of Sinn Sisamouth coming up here to visit other stars: how they would stroll along the river and he would play the harmonica. One of his famous songs, Oh Battambang, is about this river, and I think most people who come here see what he saw \u2026 they see what\u2019s so special. I can\u2019t imagine being anywhere else right now.\u201d \u2022 Singapore Airlines flies from Heathrow to Phnom Penh via Singapore for about \u00a3680 return. Buses run regularly from Phnom Penh to Battambang (five to six hours, $7) and from Siem Reap (four to five hours, $4) but for a more comfortable and faster ride, a private taxi from Phnom Penh (four hours) and Siem Reap (three-four hours) costs about $50.

It&apos;s a mood that echoes the dominant note of this short book. McEwan&apos;s prose has always been pared down but the full foliage of, say, Atonement, has now become the thinning leaf of The Children Act, whose title refers to the landmark legislation of 1989 governing the welfare of minors. This sombre tale of barely 55,000 words is a study in grey, a characteristically haunting examination of unarticulated love, of an old marriage in crisis, and a mature woman at the end of her tether. &quot;I wanted,&quot; says McEwan, in his forensic, slightly nasal but commanding drawl, &quot;to get inside the mind of a woman who is professionally totally engaged, but with turmoil in her life, who comes into a situation in which all kinds of buried feelings are stirred up\u2026&quot; Fiona Maye is a high court judge who presides in the family division. She&apos;s flinty, cerebral and childless. Her legal judgments exhibit a crisp and even-handed prose that&apos;s &quot;almost ironic, almost warm&quot;. Like McEwan, she loves classical music, especially Bach. Unlike him, she can also perform it as an amateur, especially the second Partita. This makes her sound horribly over-accomplished but McEwan says he did not want her to be &quot;a goody two-shoes&quot;. Still, with her &quot;godly distance&quot;, she may be colder to the reader than he realises. Anyway, as the novel opens, Jack, her husband of 30 years, is telling her that he wants to have &quot;one big passionate affair&quot;, a last hurrah, the Saga generation&apos;s sexual fantasy of &quot;blacking out with the thrill of it&quot;. Jack and Fiona are on the cusp of 60. Old age is creeping up. &quot;Not the full withering,&quot; writes McEwan with a kind of steely relish, &quot;but its early promise was shining through.&quot; He got the seed of the idea for The Children Act from his friend, the former appeal court judge Sir Alan Ward, coincidentally the husband of the lawyer Helen Ward, who handled McEwan&apos;s acrimonious divorce in 1995. &quot;It&apos;s an aspect of getting older,&quot; he remarks, &quot;that I find in my social circle a handful of judges, some of them retired. I&apos;ve become very intrigued by their company and conversation.&quot; He has also become intrigued by the literary dimensions of the judicial process, especially its finely balanced judgments. Ageing is the context but not the first subject of The Children Act. Simultaneously with Jack&apos;s calculated request for &quot;one last go&quot;, Fiona finds herself called to try the case of a teenage Jehovah&apos;s Witness, a brilliant and beautiful boy named Adam Henry, who is refusing the blood transfusions that might cure his leukaemia. This basic plot, says McEwan, &quot;crops up [in the west] about half a dozen times a year&quot;. What happens next, however, is much darker and stranger. On a whim, in flight from &quot;the subdued drama of her half-life with Jack&quot;, Lady Justice Maye decides to assess the boy&apos;s resolve by visiting him in hospital. This encounter, an edgy mixture of the ecstatic and the mundane, typical of McEwan, sets up a denouement replete with terror, death and reconciliation. So far, you might say, so very McEwan.     First Love, Last Rites: Natasha Gregson Wagner and  Giovanni Ribisi, in the 1997 film adaptation of McEwan's first book, published in 1978.    Ever since the publication of First Love, Last Rites, and its successors, notably The Cement Garden, The Child in Time, Enduring Love, Atonement, Saturday and On Chesil Beach, many critics have noted the quasi-gothic interplay of family and trauma in McEwan&apos;s work. But The Children Act is a more subtle, more reflective reconsideration of old themes. Although, as usual, it is compulsively readable, behind the top line of the narrative there are darker intimations of sorrow. In the last few years, McEwan the novelist has endured the harrowing experience of death very close to home. First there was the drawn-out and painful exit of his old friend and comrade-in-arms, the writer Christopher Hitchens. This, says McEwan, has left &quot;one of the biggest holes imaginable&quot;. More shockingly, this was followed in April this year by the sudden death, from a massive heart attack of his much-loved literary agent of long standing, Deborah Rogers. When that call came, he says, &quot;I could understand the grammar of the sentence \u2013 &apos;Deborah has just died&apos; \u2013 but I couldn&apos;t absorb it, couldn&apos;t believe it. I said: &apos;Say that again.&apos;&quot; Generally, McEwan, once a prince of darkness and artist of the danse macabre, is sanguine, optimistic and robust in his faithlessness, a convinced atheist. Lately, however, life and art have begun to elide. Mortality has reverberated through his life, as Auden says, like &quot;the sound of distant thunder at a picnic&quot;. He concedes that now he finds &quot;death does press in on the writing, and it does become the subject, even if it&apos;s not foregrounded&quot;. Perhaps warming to this theme, a bit later he confides that the closing pages of The Children Act contain an explicit homage to James Joyce&apos;s greatest short story, The Dead. The tone of this conversation might be sere and autumnal, but the writer remains very much himself, vigorous, resolute, engaged, with plenty of private merriment. He divides his time between a house in the country and a pied-a-terre in Bloomsbury, sustaining an energetic and quite demanding schedule. &quot;I&apos;m only 66,&quot; he protests. &quot;My notebook is full of ideas.&quot; McEwan has always conducted himself as if there were many other worthwhile things to do besides writing fiction. &quot;Don&apos;t believe any novelist who tells you it&apos;s all agony,&quot; he observes with sardonic glee. &quot;It&apos;s actually one of the most delightful, privileged existences you can imagine \u2013 assuming you can live by it.&quot; As a coda, he adds, &quot;one of the great luxuries of civilisation is solitude, as opposed to loneliness.&quot; Although comfortable with solitude, McEwan admits: &quot;I couldn&apos;t write all the time. As a writer, you have to come out into the world. I don&apos;t have a Salinger or a Pynchon impulse. There are so many things to do that are interesting.&quot; Unlike many of his literary associates he looks forward to appearing at festivals. &quot;I do half a dozen literary festivals a year. The pleasure of festivals is meeting up with other authors and friends.&quot; Strikingly generous in a milieu noted for back-biting, he stresses the pleasure he gets from &quot;seeing the pals of my generation&quot;, especially Julian Barnes, Martin Amis and James Fenton among many, and warmly celebrates the &quot;fellow feeling&quot; of this fraternity. McEwan can also afford to be comfortable among friends and family. For many years he was ever-so-slightly marginal, the outsider in a group of Oxbridge wits, more reticent and apparently less combative. Their prose had the flash of rapiers; his was a cut-throat razor. Bright swords inevitably rust. Now, with the passage of time, McEwan&apos;s prose keeps its cutting edge and his books are the ones the reading public still crave. The surge in his popularity possibly places him nearer Graham Greene than James Joyce on the Richter scale of literary vibration, but McEwan&apos;s back-list is a staple of the school syllabus. There&apos;s now a generation raised on the transgressive menace of his imagination, a world that invites the reader to trespass on the dark side of human experience, and play truant from normality. McEwan himself likes to keep on the move. In the spirit of the Romantics, his complement, or possibly antidote, to literary life is walking. The Children Act is dedicated to one of his most constant walking partners, the neuroscientist and head of the Wellcome Institute, Ray Dolan. In the past several years, often with Dolan, he has tramped thousands of miles: in the Cotswolds and Chilterns, the Lake District, the Dolomites, the Himalayas and, most recently, the Scottish Highlands. &quot;I love walking in the northwest of Scotland,&quot; he says.     McEwan with his wife, the journalist Annalena McFee. Photograph: Richard Gardner/Rex    How Scottish is he? McEwan drops into a summary: &quot;My father was Scots from Glasgow. Working class. Lied about his age to enlist at 17. Worked his way up to major. Hardly ever went back.&quot; Major McEwan&apos;s son, Ian Russell McEwan, born in 1948, was a late-empire child in the dying days of British colonialism. Growing up \u2013 an only child \u2013 he was always on the move: in Singapore and the Far East, then Germany and Libya, looking back at England from overseas, and finally stranded as a teenager in an all-boys boarding school. This curriculum vitae now looks like an ideal apprenticeship for a writer. In 2002, in a twist of fate that could animate any McEwan storyline, he discovered he had an English half-brother, an Oxfordshire bricklayer named David Sharp. On the Scottish question, he observes that his second wife, former Guardian journalist Annaleena McAfee, is &quot;passionate about Scotland&quot; but that &quot;psychologically and temperamentally I&apos;m an English novelist. Annaleena is pro [independence]. I&apos;m a pathetic Don&apos;t Know.&quot; He adds carefully: &quot;I hope it works out if they say Yes, but I worry that it won&apos;t.&quot; After this cautious political foray, he moves on to safer ground. &quot;The Act of Union never extended to the imagination. There are many English, Scots, Welsh and Irish poets and novelists. But there is no British novel, just as there&apos;s no British football. In the arts, there&apos;s nothing British.&quot; In a slightly sarcastic coda, he notes that &quot;When we invade Iraq, it&apos;s all about Britain. But when we get turned out of the world cup, it&apos;s England.&quot; McEwan&apos;s buried family ties to Scotland are evocative of a complex union and, in another breath, he freely identifies &quot;a strong Scots-English thing&quot; in the comparisons made between his work and the writings of two great Scots storytellers, connoisseurs of suspense, John Buchan and Robert Louis Stevenson. The latter, whose literary mantra was &quot;The only art is to omit&quot;, might be another covert influence on The Children Act. Like Stevenson, McEwan is comfortable placing lonely boys in extremis at the heart of his fiction. Adam Henry may be a Jehovah&apos;s Witness but he harks back to David Balfour in Kidnapped and even Jim Hawkins in Treasure Island. At the same time, contrariwise, McEwan also wants to locate his novel in what he calls &quot;the family division&quot; of English prose, the &quot;morally centred fiction of George Eliot, Conrad, James and even Austen&quot;. He has a point. McEwan certainly echoes Stevenson&apos;s mobile Scottish brevity but, in the best English tradition, he likes to explore an enclosed world as refined as ivory. Where Saturday was located in Fitzrovia and the neurological community around Queen Square, The Children Act takes place amid the booming chambers of Gray&apos;s Inn and the shadowy precincts of the justice system. Where once McEwan sat in on brain surgery, here he has immersed himself in the rhetorical interstices of the law. &quot;I love professions,&quot; he exclaims with sudden animation. &quot;I&apos;ve always liked research, and I love people&apos;s expertise. That&apos;s why I like film sets. People love nothing better than to talk about their work.&quot; He becomes momentarily didactic. &quot;Work got written out of the modern novel. In late-20th-century fiction there are too many figures whose work is never quite clear. Yet work is where most of us will spend most of our lives.&quot; It is work that gives McEwan the ideal opportunity to look in as an outsider, a spectator and literary voyeur.     Ian McEwan in 2004 with old friends Martin Amis, right, and Christopher Hitchens, whose death in 2011 left 'one of the biggest holes imaginable'.    In The Children Act he describes Fiona Maye trying to &quot;place an accent&quot; in a fellow barrister, a familiar and deeply English habit: &quot;A touch of cockney, a fainter trace of west country \u2013 the confident voice of a man who took his own competence for granted, well used to giving orders. Certain British jazzmen spoke this way, a tennis coach she knew, and non-commissioned officers, a senior policeman, paramedics, an oil-rig foreman, who had once come before her. Not men who ran the world, but who made it run.&quot; &quot;Non-commissioned&quot; is the tell-tale here: this is the voice of McEwan, the empire child, looking back from afar, in fascination, at the resilient peculiarity of English life, and the officer class that administers it. Those years following the flag as the only son of a British army major have left their faint but unmistakable, traces. He remains an outside-insider. When the conversation reverts, as it inevitably seems to do, to the subject of death, McEwan conjures a memory from this peripatetic childhood. &quot;I was eight or nine, and we lived in a six-storey block of flats in Tripoli. On those lovely warm north African evenings I used to play in the dust on my bike with the other children, mainly American service kids. Then, as it began to get dark, my father \u2013 the sort of man I dared not disobey \u2013 would come out onto the balcony, and call \u2013 Iaaannnn! \u2013 and I would have to go indoors. I imagine death is a bit like that. After the end of the day, and the fun, you get to spend a lot of time indoors\u2026&quot; McEwan has no appetite for such restrictions. &quot;Life is still too interesting. I really want to know what&apos;s going to happen in the 21st century.&quot; Time, however, ticks on without remorse, carrying him with it. Passing another cairn on the long climb up Parnassus, McEwan has just sold his manuscripts to the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas. &quot;Bundling up my papers,&quot; he says, &quot;has been another ageing thing.&quot; The library, conventionally a sanctuary, has become a sobering transit-lounge. At once dry and droll, he describes it as &quot;the antechamber to death&quot;. Out of the blue he remembers interviewing the late John Updike in his final years. &quot;We talked about all this,&quot; he recalls. &quot;He told me: &apos;The older you get the less frightening death becomes.&apos;&quot; He frowns in puzzlement. &quot;I&apos;m not sure whether to believe him.&quot; So does he believe him? &quot;No.&quot; A beat. &quot;Do you believe those obituaries that say, &apos;Died peacefully in his sleep&apos;?&quot; (McEwan was at Christopher Hitchens&apos;s bedside shortly before he died.) &quot;Still, wouldn&apos;t be a bad way to go.&quot; What, then, is the promise of old age? Apparently, for a writer known for paring his material to the bone, he will go on exploring the dynamics of brevity. &quot;I&apos;m interested in novellas,&quot; he says. &quot;Originally I saw The Children Act as a novella, max 40,000 words.&quot; The conversation meanders into a review of classic short fiction: Heart of Darkness, The Turn of the Screw and Death in Venice. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; he goes on, &quot;if there&apos;s a difference between a short novel and a novella. In the end, The Children Act came out at 55,000 words. &quot;I think,&quot; he continues, arriving at a provisional conclusion, &quot;I will write, in my 70s, more novellas. I love the idea of sitting down to read something in three hours \u2013 about the length of an opera, or a long movie, or a play where all of its structure can be held in the mind. A novella is a great length, and it&apos;s a demanding genre in which things have to be settled quickly.&quot; It&apos;s often said \u2013 even McEwan&apos;s friends have said this \u2013 that he is, au fond, a brilliant story writer, a sprinter not a marathon runner. According to the New Yorker, when Martin Amis was asked to name McEwan&apos;s greatest achievement, he replied: &quot;The first 200 pages of Atonement.&quot; In the same piece, philosopher Galen Strawson characterised McEwan&apos;s books as &quot;stories pushed into a novel&quot;. How does he respond to that? &quot;I haven&apos;t written a short story since 1976,&quot; he says evenly. &quot;Someone once said that about Enduring Love.&quot; Memorably, this novel opens with a standalone episode involving a runaway hot-air balloon that has all the stomach-churning dread of his earliest work. &quot;Ever since Enduring Love people have said, &apos;Your novels open with these amazing short stories.&apos; Oh, really?&quot; he challenges. &quot;Do they? Does Atonement? Does On Chesil Beach? That line has become a kind of on dit. I really don&apos;t think it makes any sense to say that any more,&quot; he concludes, still a touch defensive, &quot;but perhaps I might return to the short story. It might be the perfect form for old age.&quot; So, no stopping? &quot;It&apos;s hard to stop. What would you do all day? Answer emails? Go for walks?&quot; McEwan picks Philip Roth and his celebrated end-run of titles (The Plot Against America, I Married A Communist, American Pastoral, The Human Stain) as the benchmark for late flowerings, adding with approval, &quot;He was 80 before he threw in the towel. Now, I believe, he micro-manages his biography.&quot; Does McEwan have a pocket Boswell sharpening his pencil in the wings? &quot;No.&quot; What about posterity? &quot;The flipside of death?&quot; A thin smile. &quot;Oblivion? Well, I am quite interested in the way that when writers die their reputation goes into free fall \u2013 and then comes back, if you&apos;re lucky.&quot; He reflects on writers such as Philip Larkin who&apos;ve made that comeback, and others such as Angus Wilson, his former mentor and tutor, whose posthumous career has been a prolonged rallentando &quot;with endless efforts to revive him&quot;, and also the fate of his near-contemporary Bruce Chatwin. &quot;Bruce doesn&apos;t come up much now,&quot; observes McEwan with finality. &quot;Generally it&apos;s not a good idea to die.&quot; Meanwhile, in the posterity stakes, he&apos;ll take his chances. &quot;I don&apos;t expect to be watching from afar,&quot; he jokes. And if he had to choose between his books and his family? There&apos;s no hesitation. &quot;Family. I adored having children. Work and fatherhood have kept me sane. The impulse to work is like a survival instinct.&quot; McEwan at home projects an accomplished aura of self-fulfilment but his native detachment invites a question about alternative strategies. If not novels, what else? &quot;After my first stories were published,&quot; he answers, &quot;I wrote a television play, then a movie, and then a novel, and then [the film] The Ploughman&apos;s Lunch, and I thought, &apos;This is the perfect life.&apos; I still have this yearning for an alternative life in parallel. The busy-ness, the urgency, and the extended panic. I used to say I wanted to be the bass player in a Grateful Dead tribute band.&quot; He slips from teasing into seriousness. &quot;What I really would have liked to have done would have been to make movies \u2013 as a writer-director.&quot; There&apos;s another long pause, as if his imaginary career in films is spooling out in front of us. Finally he smiles: this conversation has run its course. &quot;How to be happy? Big question. I still think Freud got it right,&quot; he instructs. &quot;Good health. Interesting work. Satisfying personal relationships. It&apos;s worth checking every now and then to see how you score on all three.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 1 September 2014 to attribute a quote to Galen Strawson, the philosopher.

The modern merry-go-round hurtles through climatic changes and different hemispheres without bothering to pass \u2018Go\u2019. One Premiership director of rugby sounded almost offended when asked if he had enjoyed his summer. \u201cYou must be joking,\u201d he snorted, his mobile phone having scarcely left his hand. Along with all his rivals he knows that planning for success is not a matter of chance. Every ambitious coach needs the right type of people on the field, preferably including one or two individuals capable of winning games out of nothing. Would England have won the 2003 Rugby World Cup without Jason Robinson\u2019s input? Would the Wallabies have won the 1991 World Cup hosted in England without David Campese\u2019s mesmeric performance against New Zealand in the Dublin semi-final? Possibly, but the extra dimension of unorthodox attacking genius makes life so much easier. It will certainly not have escaped Stuart Lancaster\u2019s attention that several of his England side\u2019s prospective opponents next year are boosting their attacking stocks. Australia will shortly be able to pick Henry Speight, the powerful Fiji-born Brumbies\u2019 winger who ranks among the more lethal finishers in the Super 15. James O\u2019Connor is also due back in Queensland in the new year following his sojourn with Toulon. New Zealand do not need to pick Sonny Bill Williams on the wing because they already have the prolific Julian Savea but the cross-code man is about to be rushed back into the All Blacks midfield. If South Africa end up winning next year\u2019s World Cup, the whirring feet of the mercurial Willie le Roux will be far from irrelevant In France, Grenoble\u2019s Fijian flier Alipate Ratini is currently the Top 14\u2019s leading try-scorer, while Wales already have George North and Alex Cuthbert to unleash. All of which leaves Lancaster to seek the rugby equivalent of a bar or two of the gold currently buried by an enterprising German artist beneath a Kentish beach. By the end of the domestic season \u2013 or at least the start of his player\u2019s scheduled World Cup training block in June \u2013 he needs to unearth something out of the ordinary. As England demonstrated in the first two Tests in New Zealand in the summer, they can create chances against anyone. It is the finishing they urgently need to improve, which is why Marland Yarde, Christian Wade, Jack Nowell, Jonny May, Anthony Watson, Chris Ashton and even the young Saracen Nathan Earle \u2013 dual-registered with Bedford in the Championship \u2013 will be closely scrutinised over the next few months. Just lobbing a talented centre on to the wing for a major World Cup finale, as England ended up doing with Simon Halliday in 1991, the last time Twickenham staged the final, is no guarantee of success, as Manu Tuilagi has discovered. Yarde is a short-odds bet to be involved next year, especially if his form is enhanced by his move to Harlequins from London Irish. Wade is more electric still; had injury not wrecked his season last year he would surely have left some vapour trails. May is an excellent broken field runner still coming to terms with the fact that Test defenders are a fraction quicker and smarter. Watson is destined to feature at some stage in the next 12 months while Earle, among the reasons why England secured the Under\u201120 World Cup in New Zealand, represents the longer-term future. It is Nowell\u2019s pre-season story, however, which best sums up the determination of all concerned to be a World Cup regular. Since he last wore an England jersey, the Exeter wing has been recovering not just from a shoulder injury but a knee operation which was more problematic than some appreciated. Since the age of 15 he has been troubled with stray pieces of bone in his left knee, initially dismissed as growing pains. The solution has involved deliberately dislocating his knee-cap (as you do) and scraping off his patella to clear up the sizeable mess inside. He is now also a remarkable eight kilos heavier than when he last represented England in Rome in March, an extended break having given him the chance to put on more muscle. \u201cIdeally I want to be about 95kg, which would be a good weight for me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to be able to look after yourself out on the field. I\u2019m definitely the strongest I\u2019ve been.\u201d Burning inside is an equally fierce desire to regain his Test place. \u201cWatching the tour was tough because I\u2019ve got to know the boys pretty well,\u201d Nowell added. \u201cThings do change very quickly \u2026 there\u2019s always someone close behind you. But as I found out last year Stuart will put you in the team if you\u2019re playing well enough for your club.\u201d When Nowell does resume \u2013it may well be another week or two yet \u2013 the Chiefs and England will virtually have a new athlete at their disposal. Stronger, fitter, faster? It remains the recurring goal, for Nowell and all his rivals. England are not complaining. If they cannot prosper in the so-called attacking red zone they will struggle to win next year\u2019s Six Nations, let alone the World Cup. Tough old game Before a ball is kicked in the Premiership or the newly titled Guinness Pro12, it is important to spare a thought for those who, because of injury, cannot lace up their boots and join the fray. Particular best wishes must go to Owen Williams of Cardiff Blues, who suffered a serious spinal injury in a tournament in Singapore in June, and Pat McCabe, the Wallabies international who has been forced to retire after breaking his neck for a third time. Good luck, as well, to all the 30-somethings looking to carve out off-pitch careers when the top-level fun ends. They include Tom May and Carl Hayman and George Chuter and Sam Vesty, who have launched rugby-dedicated websites which aim to assist and interest players of all abilities. Those heading home from training for a leisurely afternoon on the PlayStation should take note: professional rugby continues to be a harsh, unforgiving and a potentially short-lived profession. One to watch this week Northampton v Gloucester Richard Hibbard v Dylan Hartley, Alex Corbisiero v John Afoa, Billy Twelvetrees v Luther Burrell, George North v Jonny May \u2026 a tasty Friday night aperitif to the Premiership season is virtually guaranteed. Saints, as defending champions, will not start half-heartedly, while the progress of Gloucester, under the new management of David Humphreys, will be absorbing. A high-scoring home win? James Hook and friends will have other ideas."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/sep/02/luella-bartley-katie-hillier-marc-jacobs", "sentences": ["The dream lasted 10 years, during which Bartley designed one of the first \u201cit\u201d bags, the Gisele, set up shop in Brook Street, won two British fashion awards and received investment from Singapore fund Club 21."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-02T17:23:06Z", "title": "How Luella Bartley and Katie Hillier made their Marc", "tags": ["Luella Bartley", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "article": "With white walls covered in magazine cuttings, a pug snuggled up in a basket and lavender-haired young women tapping away on Macs, the Marc by Marc Jacobs digs are a pretty typical example of an east London fashion studio. The difference, though, is that this isn\u2019t a small independent label worn by three people who live in a postcode that starts with an E. It\u2019s the younger line of Marc Jacobs, and a multimillion-pound, global company that makes up a chunky 70% of the entire business \u2013 one that\u2019s part-owned by fashion\u2019s biggest conglomerate, LVMH. The reason it\u2019s hiding out in Shoreditch? Two new British designers: Luella Bartley and Katie Hillier. Today Bartley is wearing an outfit fit for a festival: a slightly bobbly grey vest, old denim cut-offs and white Vans. Hillier is a bit more dressy \u2013 in claret-coloured Issey Miyake Pleats Please trousers and a dark denim tunic. They both emanate a sort of unconstructed, carefree attitude, semaphored by messy hair, no makeup, a shared pack of Marlboro Lights and bare feet under the table. It\u2019s this that they have been selling \u2013 in lots of different ways \u2013 for their entire careers; during 15 years at the forefront of the zeitgeist, turning cool into commercially desirable clothes. Their first Marc by Marc Jacobs collection \u2013 which was shown in New York in February, and is due in the shops any minute \u2013 is the latest example. With inspirations including Japanese anime classic Akira, skate culture and motocross (Bartley pilfered her son\u2019s T-shirt for the sport), they created a new Marc girl. \u201cIt was very obvious that she was the one riding the bike, she wasn\u2019t the girlfriend of the person on the bike,\u201d says Bartley. \u201cShe\u2019s independent, a little bit narky.\u201d This very British adjective \u2013 defined by the Urban Dictionary as \u201ceasily annoyed\u201d and regularly used on Coronation Street \u2013 became the unlikely buzzword for this collection. \u201cMarc really picked up on that word,\u201d says Hillier. \u201cIt was quite difficult to translate into 20 different languages, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d It is on-brand, though. \u201cA lot of those values are what I remember Marc being when it started anyway \u2013 a feisty character,\u201d says Bartley.     Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley\u2019s first collection for Marc by Marc Jacobs.    While Marc by Marc Jacobs, which launched in 2000, is a huge seller for its parent company, there was a point, not long ago, when it became a victim of its own success. Robert Duffy, the company president, admitted as much when he told WWD last year that the brand was \u201cgetting a little stale\u201d with prom dresses and cute prints wilting a little, certainly on the runway, where they had started to look a bit irrelevant. With Jacobs leaving Louis Vuitton after 16 years to concentrate on his own business, it was time to bring in some new voices. Hillier was an obvious candidate. She had been working with the brand for 12 years and was offered the role of creative director last year. \u201cI got the call on Friday night and discussed it a little bit with my boyfriend,\u201d explains Hillier. \u201cIn the end I decided it was something I couldn\u2019t have not done. There was only Luella that I wanted to do it with.\u201d Bartley and Hillier are great friends, having been introduced in the late 1990s by uber-stylist Katie Grand, now editor-in-chief of Love and collaborator with everyone from Miuccia Prada to Marc Jacobs. Within a week they were working together at the Luella label that Bartley founded in 1999, which Hillier describes as a \u201cvery easy transition. I think it took about a week.\u201d An early Bartley-Hillier hit was belts with fluoro beads. Bartley modelled them \u2013 in a bikini \u2013 on the cover of Grand\u2019s Pop magazine.     Katie Hillier and Luella Bartley on the catwalk at the end of their first Marc by Marc Jacobs show. Photograph: PR    The go-go 1990s were exciting times in London fashion. If the generation that followed \u2013 Christopher Kane, Jonathan Saunders etc \u2013 were serious and ambitious, this lot were more haphazard. An overgrown adolescent style permeated fashion, and Grand, Hillier and Bartley were at the vanguard, in a gang that studied at St Martins, drank at the Bricklayers Arms in Shoreditch with musicians including Pulp\u2019s Steve Mackey (now Mr Grand) and artists Tim Noble and Sue Webster. \u201cAt that time, with that group of people, we were all very young and very excited and keen to get into the business,\u201d says Bartley. \u201cWe all had energy and blind faith.\u201d Hillier remembers it slightly differently. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t very contrived,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019d go to a party and be really badly behaved because there was free alcohol.\u201d Asked what it was like being in the cool crowd, Bartley makes a bit of a face. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody really thinks about,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t strive to be that do you? I think if you were self-conscious about it you\u2019d be really embarrassed.\u201d They are just as well-connected now. Bartley is married to photographer David Sims, with three children under 11, while Hillier is in a relationship with Patrick Grant, the dashing E Tautz designer and judge on The Great British Sewing Bee. Notoriously, the heady combination of booze and blind faith saw Bartley \u2013 then working as a journalist at Vogue \u2013 decide to set up Luella after a drunken conversation in the pub. From the first collection \u2013 called Daddy I Want A Pony, and with a presentation in Mackey\u2019s flat \u2013 she was London fashion\u2019s darling. The aesthetic comprised reworked classics such as hunting jackets, prom dresses and pink \u2013 which, in a typically connected anecdote, became the brand\u2019s signature after the Clash\u2019s Paul Simonon, on a night out, told Bartley that it was \u201cthe only true rock\u2019n\u2019roll colour\u201d. The dream lasted 10 years, during which Bartley designed one of the first \u201cit\u201d bags, the Gisele, set up shop in Brook Street, won two British fashion awards and received investment from Singapore fund Club 21. It was perhaps too much too fast \u2013 the brand was one of the recession\u2019s first fashion casualties, filing for bankruptcy in 2009.     Marc by Marc Jacobs AW14: inspired by Akira, skate culture and motocross. Photograph: Victor Virgile /Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images    Bartley retreated to Cornwall and a life of surfing and domesticity with Sims, returning to her first talent \u2013 writing. A Guide to English Style \u2013 a funny look at fashion tribes, a sort of Peter York for the noughties \u2013 came out in 2010. That year, she got an MBE. The followup, a graphic novel illustrated by Zoe Taylor, comes out this year. She has now returned to London. Hillier has kept busy too. As a freelance accessories designer, she has worked for Marc by Marc Jacobs, Loewe and Asprey. She designed Victoria Beckham\u2019s bag range and created her own fine jewellery range, Hillier. The gold paperclip bunnies with diamonds for eyes are now worn as pendants around the most alpha of necks \u2013 including Hillier\u2019s and Luella\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s important to do lots of things,\u201d she says, pulling at said bunny, \u201ckeep your brain going.\u201d Bartley and Hillier\u2019s presence at Marc could be held up as an example of fun returning to fashion, after the austerity of minimalism. The industry has certainly missed what the pair have in spades: irreverent humour and a writer\u2019s tendency to design in characters rather than trends. Still, things have changed. Bartley and Hillier are now 40 and 41, with grownup concerns \u2013 schedules, childcare, box sets \u2013 scuppering that creativity just a little. They travel to New York to visit the main Marc team every month and do fittings via Skype. \u201cYou can\u2019t play with the fabric,\u201d says Bartley, \u201cwhich I hate, but it\u2019s very connected.\u201d Still, that cheeky, very British spirit is alive and well \u2013 they are wise enough to know it\u2019s their calling card. The 2.0 version of the Luella and Katie dream team shows itself in a bullish, gutsy \u2013 you might say narky \u2013 refusal to grow up completely. This collection was designed to be worn, says Hillier, \u201cby a 22-year-old\u201d. \u201cOr someone like us,\u201d says Bartley. \u201cI think the challenge is to keep that youthful spirit but make it appealing to everyone,\u201d says Hillier. It\u2019s one, you\u2019d have to wager, they\u2019re more than up to."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/03/uk-ninth-best-performing-economies-world-economic-forum", "sentences": ["The Geneva-based thinktank, which has come to prominence as a club for the rich and powerful to debate global business issues, rewarded Switzerland with the top spot for the sixth year running, while Singapore ranked second for the fourth consecutive year."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-02T23:01:00Z", "title": "UK moves up to ninth in thinktank's list of best performing economies", "tags": ["Economic growth (GDP)", "Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "UK news", "Economic policy", "Politics"], "article": "Britain has moved up a list of the world&apos;s best performing economies, according to a global thinktank that praised the government for reducing the public sector deficit and maintaining one of the most flexible labour markets in the developed world. The World Economic Forum said Britain had improved its performance over the last year, moving it from 10th to 9th place, behind the Netherlands and above Sweden. In a report welcomed by the Treasury, the WEF said a wealth of sophisticated businesses and a willingness to adopt new technologies put Britain in a healthy position to improve productivity over the next few years. But it warned in its annual performance monitor that British businesses still struggled to access credit, the workforce remained inadequately trained and tax rates were complex and too high. The Geneva-based thinktank, which has come to prominence as a club for the rich and powerful to debate global business issues, rewarded Switzerland with the top spot for the sixth year running, while Singapore ranked second for the fourth consecutive year. Striking a less positive note in an overview of the global economy, it voiced concern about further unrest in Ukraine and the lack of structural reforms in most countries that needed to increase productivity. &quot;The strained global geopolitical situation, the rise of income inequality, and the potential tightening of financial conditions could put the still tentative recovery at risk and call for structural reforms to ensure more sustainable and inclusive growth,&quot; said Klaus Schwab, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF. Several high-profile international bodies have warned that the global recovery is threatened by the escalating conflict in Ukraine in addition to the continued weakness of the European economy. The Washington-based International Monetary Fund and Paris-based Organisation of Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) have downgraded their global economic forecasts this year in response to a poor performance by the eurozone economies and the prospect of further economic sanctions being imposed on Moscow. The WEF&apos;s Global Competitiveness Index, which uses a string of measures to assess the performance of 144 economies, found there was &quot;insufficient progress in adopting and implementing structural reforms necessary for long-term economic growth&quot;. The thinktank has argued for business and labour to end restrictive practices that hold back investment in new ways of working and technological developments. Britain is praised for its &quot;efficient labour market&quot;, which is ranked 5th in the world, and for the uptake of technology, for which it is ranked 5th. The quick adoption of new technologies, according to the WEF, is &quot;coupled with a highly competitive and large market that allows for highly sophisticated and innovative businesses to spring up and develop&quot;. But the thinktank said: &quot;The country should look into effective ways to raise the overall quality of its education system, which ranks 23rd, most notably in the areas of mathematics and science, which will be crucial to continue fostering innovation in the country.&quot; Britain has moved up and down the WEF league in recent years, from 10th in 2011 to eighth the following year and back to 10th last year. This year Japan jumped three places to sixth and the US moved two places into the third spot. Japan was praised for its industrial strength and competitiveness, despite running a debt worth 240% of its GDP, three times the ratio in the UK, and an annual budget deficit around twice as high as Britain at 10%. Like the UK, the US was commended for its high level of business sophistication, university system and innovative tech sector. The chancellor, George Osborne, said the index was &quot;further evidence that our long term economic plan is seen by the world to be delivering a more competitive economy&quot;. He highlighted the direct link drawn by the WEF between a credible fiscal policy and &quot;our country&apos;s ability to attract business and create jobs is compelling&quot;. Osborne argued the UK had regained its reputation for low business taxes, which he said was confirmed by KPMG&apos;s 2013 survey of tax competitiveness, which ranked the UK as the most attractive tax regime compared with the US, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Where the UK stands on: Institutions Country ranks highly for guarding property rights, keeping corruption to a minimum and for its well-oiled legal system. It ranks 7th for its legal system and 8th for its ability to safeguard intellectual property. Infrastructure Country ranks 27th for overall infrastructure quality behind not only the US and Japan, but also Portugal, Spain, Malaysia, Bahrain and Barbados. It ranks 51st in terms of the number of mobile phone registrations per head. Other measures of infrastructure are almost as unflattering. It ranks 30th for road quality.

Born in China, Zhou now lives in the US, and the east-west fusion that characterises his music is informed by the classical Chinese tradition that was suppressed when he was a teenager during the Cultural Revolution. Postures is a big, three-movement work, cast in some respects along traditional lines, with overtones of Ravel and Stravinsky in the scoring. But the title derives from kung fu and the complex piano writing aligns western virtuosity with eastern ideas of the martial artist as a spiritually focused athlete. The piano&apos;s percussive qualities are stressed throughout. Haefliger&apos;s rapid-fire figurations are tracked and echoed by a\u00a0huge array of orchestral percussion. During the slow movement, he bends into the body of the instrument and strikes the strings with his hands to produce bell-like sounds that suggest ritual solemnity. It&apos;s not perfect. Zhou can repeat ideas too often. There are discursive passages, and only the hair-raising finale feels compact. But it&apos;s a sensational tour de force from Haefliger, and a fine display of orchestral bravado for the SSO and Shui. Russian music formed the rest of the programme, which kicked off with a driven, rather unyielding account of the overture to Glinka&apos;s Ruslan and Lyudmila and closed with Rachmaninov&apos;s second symphony. Shui&apos;s credentials as a Rachmaninov interpreter are impeccable, and his no-frills performance was intense without sentimentality, noble but never bombastic. The tang in the SSO&apos;s brass throughout the evening suggested an orchestral sound modelled along Russian rather than western European lines.

I chose to take my MBA at Salford because I live in Manchester and it was where I did my first degree. The MBA is very international in its student make-up and accredited by the Association of MBAs, which is important to me. Also I like the age range and the mix of nationalities. The international trip that Salford organised as part of the course was invaluable. I chose to go to Hong Kong for a week and I am glad I did, because it was very interesting to see how the Chinese have developed their businesses. We visited a digital marketing company as well as an architect, who is a Salford alumnus. We were asked to investigate the MBA market in Hong Kong on behalf of the university. I made a lot of contacts that could be useful for me in the future if I decide to start up another business. I also got some good ideas and found that the Hong Kong Chinese are at least three years ahead of us in digital marketing from the point of view of technology. I would like to do business with China. I like their professional approach and their work ethic.

He is also co-author of The Business Solution to Poverty: Designing Products and Services for Three Billion New Customers. The following interview took place at the BoP World Convention and Expo in Singapore. I understand that you previously worked in psychiatry. Would you say that experience influences your approach when developing products for people from low-income communities?  I was considered a bit of a maverick in psychiatry, where I worked primarily with people who suffered from mental illness. The assumption back then was that people were admitted to hospitals where we could treat the mental illness. But, when I interviewed my patients, I came to realise that, in a majority of the cases, my patients were adversely affected by social and environmental factors, which we were not addressing. I\u2019d say that was true of about two thirds of my patients. I learned then that you have to understand in depth the point of view of the patient - you need to talk to them, and to understand their needs in context. Only then can you truly help them. I think this translates into the work that I do now with our customers. When I started in development, I determined that I would interview at least 100 people every year who live at the base of the pyramid. This has led me to personally interview over 3,000 people in 25 years. I spend six to eight hours with each family, walking with them through their fields, learning about their markets. I\u2019ve never done that without coming up with at least one transformative project. I now know more about the rural poor than I know about any other population in the world. I find that many companies try to serve the poor by taking products that they are already selling, cutting the price, making some small adjustments, and then trying to sell. Those businesses will almost always fail. We run a different kind of business, one in which we design our products and services specifically for the 90%, rather than for the wealthy, and we do that by understanding the needs of the poor. Tell us a bit more about your approach to design. What are some of the methods that companies can take to make their products more affordable and accessible to the base of the pyramid (BoP)? This is straightforward. Interview your customers, and you will know much more about what to do. And then design your products for those customers, the other 90%. One thing that we have found is that selling a technology to the BoP market is a loser\u2019s bet. Where you make the most money is selling services related to the technology. It\u2019s like in the telecommunications business: the money does not come from selling mobile phones, it comes from selling airtime, applications, and top-ups. Similarly, selling water purification systems is not as lucrative as selling the resulting clean water. BoP business is by nature high-touch work; it is very expensive to do marketing for a new product. You need to have a high margin on your products for them to be financially worthwhile. Do you have a preferred approach to measuring the social impact of your companies? I believe all enterprises, whether nonprofit or for-profit need to have measures of impact. But, people can over complicate things. A lot of social impact measurement methodologies are too much - you don\u2019t necessarily need such detailed measurement schemes. My belief is that in an \u201cimpact business,\u201d you build the social impact into the DNA of the business. When you have a business model that is designed to achieve social impact - for example, serving people with clean water, which contributes to many healthcare improvements - you can choose a handful of indicators to track the company\u2019s progress and impact. You must be disciplined in finding those key indicators. Then, the real challenge is not in measuring the social impact, it is in making money while doing it. What are some of your challenges as you look at scaling up BoP businesses? In our experience at Windhorse International, where we work to create for-profit businesses that serve the poor, we have found that one of the biggest challenges is raising capital. Investors and banks still find this kind of business to be too risky to invest in. Even so, we have found investors - some of them non-traditional - and we are succeeding in building profitable businesses. I think that once we succeed, it will make it much easier for other companies in these markets to raise capital. Through some of our projects, we have found that it is entirely possible to create market-price products for the poor that are capable of generating a 300% return. It can be a highly lucrative business. I think that the next type of emerging market is the customer that makes less than $2 (\u00a31.22) per day. That makes up 40% of the world\u2019s customers, and it is a totally untapped market. Just as with emerging markets, you must develop a strategy to enter the BoP market. Yet it will be the next frontier. The possibilities of moving hundreds of millions of people out of poverty through integrating them into the formal economy are endless. I\u2019ve got 10-15 more ideas for BoP businesses waiting to go. That\u2019s what excites me is trying to create the next transformative business model. Who knows whether it will work or not? The process of trying to make it happen is so fulfilling. Thank you for sharing your experience with us. We wish you the best in scaling up your good work!

Europe\u2019s top business schools are responding to this need; courses at Insead, IESE, HEC, and London Business School incorporate a language requirement as well as the opportunity to learn and practise another language. Insead teaches Mandarin at Fontainbleu and in Singapore. For some schools, a language component is a compulsory part of the MBA. The Insead MBA is taught exclusively in English, so fluency in the language is a pre-requisite, but in addition to that, another language at a practical level is also required for entry \u2013 and students are expected to add a third language by the time they finish their MBA. \u201cAt Insead we believe strongly in the importance of an international outlook and the ability to work effectively in multiple cultures,\u201d says admissions director Pejay Belland. London Business School (LBS) has no language entry requirement, but students cannot graduate unless they have reached ILR level 2 (limited working proficiency) in a second language. \u201cWe expect all of our MBAs to be able to do business in another language and understand that country\u2019s cultural subtleties,\u201d says admissions director for the MBA, David Simpson. Taught over 15-21 months, the LBS MBA incorporates sufficient time for intensive language study and overseas internships, which put students\u2019 language skills to the test. Seven core languages \u2013 Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Mandarin, Arabic and Russian \u2013 are taught by visiting faculty from Kings College London\u2019s languages department. Besides this, courses in other languages may be offered if there is sufficient demand. At HEC business school in Paris, the language entry requirement is more relaxed. \u201cYou might have lived outside your home country for a period, attended school abroad, or be working for an international company mixing with people from different nationalities,\u201d says admissions director Philippe Oster. Although classes are taught in English, proficiency in French is required. \u201cFrench language for non-natives is compulsory and credit bearing. MBA students spend at least four hours a week for eight months learning French,\u201d says Oster. Masters in management degrees, taught over two years and regarded by many as the equivalent of an MBA, typically include study in several different countries and languages.

Sir Howard Davies\u2019s commission said the mayor of London\u2019s project was impracticable and unaffordable. This is ridiculous, said Boris, Sir Howard told me privately that another airport commission would be needed in 2020, raising the prospect of a third and maybe a fourth runway at Heathrow. That\u2019s a lie, countered Sir Howard. \u201cHe\u2019s said all kinds of things about what I said to him yesterday, most of them are actually untrue,\u201d he told the Times, prompting Johnson to hit back, also via the Times. He went so far as to furnish the paper with a note of his conversation with Sir Howard. It said \u201c2020 \u2013 a new review\u201d. This proves, it was claimed, that Davies said a second commission will be needed in 2020. But does it? Not necessarily.

On Tuesday the yes camp closed the poll gap to six points. Today, pundit Bill claimed that a chat with his son, Kenny, had turned him into a yes man. Or \u201cI\u2019m voting for Generation Yes\u201d, as a headline writer put it. Kenny did his bit, but many will blame the PM. On Monday he didn\u2019t look Bill in the eye or offer him a beer.

The Daily Express sounds the alarm about those EU blighters and possible wattage restrictions for kettles. \u201cThe EU is trying to take away our right to a cuppa\u201d, screams the paper. But if the Eurocrats have taken against kettles, where might they have got the idea from? Perhaps they took their cue from the Express itself \u2013 where, as we reported last October, there was a widely circulated, widely ridiculed edict that electric kettles should be banished from the paper\u2019s offices and that those discovered by management would be confiscated. Not long before, Express owner Richard Desmond himself was said to have been menaced by a trailing kettle flex. Underlings sympathised \u2013 of course they did \u2013 but they do like a cuppa at the Express, and they don\u2019t particularly like paying canteen prices, so the kettles of resistance went undercover. They have since resurfaced, a constant symbol of worker-bee defiance. As things stand, there are \u201cmany, many kettles of resistance\u201d, a whistleblower tells us. So the EU story was always likely to resonate. They understand the politics of tea at the Express. \u2022 Finally, with Islamic State rampant and Vladimir Putin riding roughshod over world opinion, Newport hosts the most important Nato conference for many years.

McAleese, who founded the business with his wife Irene, became determined to find a way for cyclists to be more visible on the road. The McAleeses, who had been living in Singapore, left their corporate careers behind and moved to Northern Ireland to set up See.Sense.But they still needed to to find a cost-effective way to build brand awareness in the wider cycling market. So they decided to exploit the media attention surrounding the Giro as much as they could, explains Irene McAleese.They created a special-edition pink Corsa Rosa light, and put together a commemorative brochure with the local cycling community. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board gave lights to 100 visiting dignitaries and journalists and Belfast\u2019s lord mayor cycled around the city with his See.Sense light. The business also used content marketing, producing a lighthearted video with a local videographer that went up on their site the day the Giro started. The video, which captures the scenery along the race route, has received more than 5,000 YouTube hits and was widely shared on its social media accounts, reaching more than 80,000 people on Facebook alone. Irene McAleese says: \u201cI think it got shared so much because people were watching the Giro race around the world and seeing the beautiful scenery. We also had a competition where you could win accommodation along the route.\u201d See.Sense\u2019s trade stand and billboards along the Giro route also gave it good visibility to the crowds and the film crews, and they were interviewed by local media, including UTV news, BBC Ulster Radio and the Belfast Telegraph. Its Facebook page grew by 1,000 likes and it doubled its Twitter followers. It also sold out of its special-edition Corsa Rosa lights. The business has continued to build strong links with the local North Down Cycling Club, the largest in Northern Ireland with 400 members, and recently took on a copywriter to develop its blog. The marketing campaign followed an exciting first year for See.Sense, which was founded in April 2013. They launched the light on Kickstarter in October that year, which was proved a \u201cfantastic vehicle for marketing and PR,\u201d says Irene McAleese. \u201cThe response was phenomenal. In eight days we met our fundraising goal and we went on to sell \u00a333,500 worth of lights in one month. More than 500 people backed it and they have been really really important to us through the whole journey.\u201d She adds: \u201cWe may have underestimated the impact it could have. You get real customers who see your product and understand what it does. We had some great media attention.\u201d Following on from the Kickstarter campaign, the business landed a place with online cycling retailer Chain Reaction Cycles and has entered and won several business competitions, including Best Early-stage company in Northern Ireland at the Seedcorn Investor Readiness Competition and Breakthrough Company of the Year at the Invest Northern Ireland Propel Awards.

The cloud rained heavily on London Welsh when it was discovered midway through the 2012-13 season that the Kiwi Tyson Keats had been registered as an England-qualified player: it turned out that he was eligible through a grandfather but false paperwork had been submitted and the Exiles were deducted five points. From that point their campaign never recovered its earlier momentum.

There is a real communal atmosphere which served us well in the Championship last season.\u201d London Welsh won promotion at the first attempt by defeating Bristol in the two-legged final. They were regarded as underdogs, not least because of the money the west country club had spent assembling their squad, but they won both matches. \u201cWe took a big lead into the second game, but I told the players it was important that we beat them on the night, not just on aggregate, and they all rolled up their sleeves. It was Bristol\u2019s final match at the Memorial Stadium and we knew they would throw everything at us, but we stood firm and showed we thoroughly merited a place in the Premiership.\u201d Two years ago London Welsh won two of their first four matches, their victims including Sunday\u2019s opponents at the Kassam Stadium, Exeter. Their record at the halfway stage was four victories (more than Newcastle managed in 2013-14) and seven defeats, four of them yielding bonus points, but after the Keats affair became public they collapsed and did not win another Premiership game again until the final weekend of the regular season. \u201cTwo years ago promotion was not confirmed until July but we have had an extra month to recruit this time,\u201d said Burnell, who has brought in 25 new players to strengthen his side. \u201cWe have been able to bring in experience but we have also recruited some young talent and we have a good mix in the squad. We know it is going to be tough but I am not going to say that our ambition is to finish 11th: we have to aim higher than that. \u201cExeter are an excellent example of what clubs promoted from the Championship can achieve. Rob Baxter [their head coach] has done remarkably well and last season they were playing host to Toulon and winning a trophy. They are our model: we have not come up to go straight back down.\u201d Burnell lives in Richmond while his family remain in Wales where his son and daughter are educated at a Welsh language school. \u201cThe separation is hard but that is the nature of the job,\u201d he said. \u201cI was enjoying it at Cardiff Blues but the nature of sport is that things change and you go where the work is. I am relishing the chance to test myself in the Premiership. I think I achieved everything that was asked of me at the Blues and I am more than comfortable with the job I have now.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/08/-sp-urban-shield-police-militarization-ferguson-oakland", "sentences": ["The men huddling in groups around the stalls are all members of police Swat teams, 35 in all, who have come to Oakland from across the US and as far afield as Singapore, South Korea and Brazil."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-08T19:24:32Z", "title": "Urban Shield: after Ferguson, police and suppliers consider fate of military-grade tactical gear", "tags": ["US crime", "US news", "Oakland"], "article": "\u201cWarriors\u201d, says the sign emblazoned in huge letters across the top of the Marriott conference center in downtown Oakland. It refers to the Golden State Warriors, the hometown basketball team who have their practice facilities here, but it might equally apply to the unusual gathering inside the hotel. Sprawled across the ground floor of the Marriott, a trade show was under way that represents the modern face of policing in America. Hundreds of burly men (they are largely men), heads shaved and dressed in battlefield uniforms in black, green or camouflage are milling around in groups of 10 or 20. There to greet them are scores of weapons manufacturers and military-grade technology companies eager to win their business. On three sides of the hall, giant black tactical armoured vehicles are stationed, wheels chest-height, sides armour-plated to resist an AK-47 round or blast of a roadside bomb, roofs decked out with spotlights, surveillance cameras and swivel turrets able to house machine guns. One of the vehicles, the aptly named Sentinel \u2013 21ft long, 17,500lbs in weight, and costing $250,000 and up \u2013 was developed by a Florida-based company called International Armored Group that began supplying the US army in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cWith all that experience in blast resistance, we decided to branch off into tactical vehicles tailored to police departments at home,\u201d said the company\u2019s Sally Stefova. The men huddling in groups around the stalls are all members of police Swat teams, 35 in all, who have come to Oakland from across the US and as far afield as Singapore, South Korea and Brazil. They are here for the annual Urban Shield \u2013 a four-day event that concludes Monday. The schedule includes a 48-hour simulated disaster training program that has put the Swat teams through mock scenarios of a mass shooting, hostage-taking or terrorist radiological attack. When they are not engaging in such exercises, police departments are invited to browse the Urban Shield vendors\u2019 show where weapons contractors who normally deal with the US military seek to redirect their products to domestic use on America\u2019s streets. \u2018Keep calm and return fire\u2019 This year\u2019s Urban Shield has been held under the shadow of a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. As a result of the shooting of the unarmed black teenager Michael Brown on 9 August and the protests that ensued, ordinary Americans were introduced for the first time to the look of their modern police force. Pictures of black armoured personnel carriers trundling through city streets topped by marksmen wielding sniper rifles, while on the ground officers kitted out in full camouflage gear pointed M-16 assault rifles at protesters standing with their hands above their heads, were beamed into millions of living rooms. As the tragedy of Ferguson unfolded, the country collectively gasped and shook its head. Where was all this happening? In a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, or in Fallujah?     Police advance through a cloud of tear gas toward demonstrators protesting against the killing of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images    Given the national soul-searching about militarized policing that Ferguson inspired, you might expect to see a muted, self-reflective Urban Shield this year. Not so, judging from the hardware on display on the convention floor. As you enter the vast exhibition space you are accosted by assault rifles, gas masks, helmets, tactical knives, robots, drones, night-vision devices and countless other references to the war zone. The poster for the Urban Shield event itself shows a police officer from Oakland\u2019s local Alameda sheriff\u2019s department wearing a helmet and goggles and pointing an assault rifle directly out at the viewer. He crouches above a clock that has stopped symbolically at 9:11, alongside the words \u201cCritical training 4 critical times\u201d. Many of the stalls are selling products initially created by the Pentagon and now repurposed for use by police departments. Armored Mobility Inc is offering body armour with built-in plates that can stop 30 rounds from an AK-47. The company is aggressively marketing its armoured shield to police officers posted within elementary schools. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but school shootings like the one at Sandy Hook in Connecticut can happen anywhere at any time,\u201d said the firm\u2019s Bill Gazza. A company called Aircover is offering unmanned aerial systems, or drones, that it originally developed for the Department of Defense for sale. Its QR 425 four-propeller drone can be in the air within 15 seconds, rises at 80 feet per second, is largely self-piloting and streams military-grade encrypted high definition surveillance footage back to the base unit. A UK weapons manufacturer based in Portsmouth, Accuracy International, is trying to interest American police departments in the sniper rifles that it originally designed for the British army. The guns, equipped with interchangeable barrels, are also widely used by the German armed forces. Even the T-shirts on sale at Urban Shield show no self-awareness of post-Ferguson sensitivities. \u201cKeep calm and return fire,\u201d one model says. Another has printed on it the figure of a person with hands in the air \u2013 the same symbol of peaceful defiance used by Ferguson protesters \u2013 onto which a gun-sight has been superimposed directly over the head, above the rubric: \u201cThis is my peace sign\u201d. \u2018If the bad guy has a gun you need a rifle\u2019 Ronnie Fowles is managing a stall at Urban Shield for his company, First Spear, that makes lightweight carriers in camouflaged nylon. First Spear is based in St Louis, close to Ferguson, and before he joined the firm Fowles spent 10 years as a member of the city\u2019s metropolitan police Swat team. Each year, his unit carried out up to 350 raids on houses to search for drugs or weapons, often turning up in armoured vehicles like the Sentinel and effecting what is known in the trade as \u201chard doors\u201d where forced entry is gained using a battering ram. In his view, the Swat teams in Ferguson acted entirely appropriately. \u201cThrowing stones and Molotov cocktails \u2013 that\u2019s not protesting peacefully. You can\u2019t have police officers stand in the streets without protecting themselves.\u201d     Members of the Sacramento Swat team checkout a sniper rifle.  Photograph: Robert Gumpert/Guardian    Fowles\u2019s belief is that the changing face of American policing has been a necessary bottom-up response to the increasingly well-armed criminal and domestic terrorist. But that argument is disputed by criminologists and civil liberties groups who point instead to a top-down cause of militarized policing: billions of dollars of taxpayers\u2019 money that has been spent since 9/11 acquiring tactical equipment for police departments by the federal government. Under the Pentagon\u2019s 1033 program, mine-resistant armoured vehicles, or MRaps, assault rifles and other heavy gear designed for Iraq and Afghanistan has been thrown at police departments at a rate of about half a billion dollars-worth a year. A similar amount goes out annually under the department of justice\u2019s Edward Byrne Memorial JAG program and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI), both of which provide grants for police to buy the latest military-grade gadgetry of the kind that\u2019s on display at Urban Shield. The outcome, according to a major report earlier this year from the American Civil Liberties Union, is that military hardware is making its way onto the streets of America for use in everyday policing. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for the federal government to be fuelling the militarization of local police. Urban Shield seems to encapsulate this blurring of the lines between military and police,\u201d said Kara Dansky, author of the ACLU report. In the aftermath of Ferguson, there are signs of change in Washington. President Obama has ordered a review of the 1033, Byrne and UASI programmes and Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri will hold congressional hearings on them on Tuesday.     \u2018Urban Shield seems to encapsulate this blurring of the lines between military and police,\u2019 said Kara Dansky, author of the ACLU report. Photograph: Robert Gumpert/Guardian    But so far the message doesn\u2019t appear to have filtered down to the local level. The Bay Area UASI helped to fund Urban Shield this year, and the DHS even has its own stall in the vendors\u2019 show where it is showing off the latest whizz-bang tools created by its science and technology directorate. The innovations include a radio-wave machine that can detect heartbeats through a wall to help Swat teams anticipate how many bodies they will face when they make a \u201chard door\u201d. There\u2019s also a robot that can shoot a pistol \u2013 for testing purposes only, DHS officials stressed. With such federal encouragement beaming out from the DHS stall, it is scarcely surprising that the prevailing mood at Urban Shield is that the trend towards militarized policing is here to stay. As Steve Lenthe, a member of a narcotics unit within the local Alameda County sheriffs office who is participating in the event, sees it, Ferguson-style policing is essential because \u201cmy job is not to take a bullet. If wearing full body armour gets me home safely, absolutely.\u201d He thinks police have to stay a step ahead of the criminal. \u201cIf the bad guy\u2019s got a stick you need a baton, if he has a gun you need a rifle, if he gets hold of a rifle you need something even more powerful.\u201d But what is the precise nature of the threat that obligates this ever inflating police-criminal arms race? Where is it coming from? \u2018New threats are being invented to use as justification\u2019 Lenthe was one of several police officers and vendors who told the Guardian that a serious threat came from Iraq and Afghanistan military veterans returning home with post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cThese are sophisticated people, guys coming back from combat who know how to use their weapons and are dealing with PTSD,\u201d he said, despite the insistence of the Department of Veterans Affairs that the link between PTSD and violent crime is overblown to the point of distortion. The idea raises the paradoxical thought that military hardware from America\u2019s two wars is being transferred to domestic police under the Pentagon\u2019s 1033 programme in order to deal with the threat of US veterans returning from those very same conflicts. Another paradox is that police forces are acquiring military equipment to protect them from themselves. When I asked Joshua Nielsen, a sales rep from Adamson police products, why the latest model of gas mask on display was necessary, he replied that Swat teams wore them when they propelled gas canisters into a house before raiding it. Nielsen also said the masks came in handy when police deploy tear gas into a crowd, as they did at Ferguson. Several Urban Shield participants mentioned crowd control as one of the features of the perceived \u201crising threat levels\u201d that justified the trend towards militarization.  We are in a climate where a lot of people are fighting against authority. In the Sixties people linked arms and sang songs, now we have anarchist groups and the Black Panthers and agitators from all the splinter groups throwing things at us,\u201d said Lenthe.  He mentioned the Occupy Oakland protests as an example of the kind of civil unrest the police were up against. In October 2011, officers in riot gear shot tear gas as they cleared an Occupy camp at City Hall; protesters returned fire with turquoise and red paint.     Matt Foster of Oakland holds a Stop Urban Shield sign outside the convention. \u2018I\u2019ve been protesting for 30 years on issues of police brutality and many others,\u2019 he said. Photograph: Rem O'Donnelley/Demotix/Corbis    Occupy Oakland protesters were among the small crowd of demonstrators who gathered outside the Urban Shield convention on Friday wielding placards that said: \u201cStop police brutality\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re not a hero you\u2019re a murderer\u201d. \u201cWhenever police say they were acting in response to crowd violence against them, it\u2019s normally the opposite. How can you talk about an unarmed public threatening a militarized police like this?\u201d said Lara Kiswani from San Francisco. Tom Nolan, a criminologist at Merrimack College in Massachusetts who served 27 years in the Boston police department and has studied the trend in modern policing, said that \u201cnew threats are being invented that law enforcers and manufacturers use as justification. Weapons companies who used to court the US military now see a commercial opportunity in domestic police forces so they try to convince people of a need that is non-existent.\u201d So is that commercial opportunity now under threat in the wake of Ferguson? Some of the Urban Shield participants expressed anxiety about a Ferguson backlash that would force police forces to give up some of their armaments and leave officers exposed. Kendra Nunes, a patrol sergeant in San Jose, said she regretted the fact that her police department had decided as a result of the furore around militarized policing following Ferguson to hand back to the federal government its surveillance drone and to pass on to another agency the armoured vehicle that it had bought with an UASI grant. \u201cI think it\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019ve given the drone and the armoured vehicle up,\u201d Nunes said. \u201cWhat good are we if we are outgunned by the bad guy? What can we do if we are in a school shoot-out facing a guy with an assault rifle and the public don\u2019t want us to have an armoured vehicle because it makes them feel uncomfortable?\u201d She added that in the end it was up to society to decide where to draw the line. \u201cBut until the politicians make up their minds, who are the victims \u2013 the innocent people caught in the crossfire and the police officers called out to respond.\u201d But Nunes\u2019s fear that America is turning away from a heavily-armed police is atypical, judging from the Marriott\u2019s packed exhibition hall. Several of the country\u2019s top companies had stalls in the vendors\u2019 show, suggesting they still believe there is serious money to be made, including telecoms firms such as Verizon, Samsung and Sprint, arms manufacturers like Sig Sauer, and even the ride-sharing service Uber which sponsored this year\u2019s Urban Shield. \u201cThis militarized policing thing \u2013 it\u2019s all political chest-beating,\u201d said the narcotics officer Lenthe, expressing a view shared by many Swat officers and vendors who talked to the Guardian. \u201cAmericans have short memories and when something else happens all this knee-jerk stuff about military equipment will all be blown away.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/sep/09/school-class-sizes-good-thing-oecd-report", "sentences": ["&quot;In upper secondary education it&apos;s what we see in high-performing countries like Japan, Singapore, and Korea."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-09T09:01:04Z", "title": "OECD report: are larger school class sizes a good thing?", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "UK news", "OECD", "Business"], "article": "For many years, British governments of all stripes have boasted of efforts to cut class sizes.

But, you generally need to bring in more teachers to raise more classes. &quot;It&apos;s crucial how good those extra teachers are. If they&apos;re in the bottom 10% then class size reduction actually makes things worse. You get an extra four months&apos; learning per year from the smaller class sizes, but you close five months&apos; learning per year because now you&apos;ve got so many bad teachers in the system. It&apos;s really hard to predict how this will play out in a different country.&quot; While controlling larger classes might be easier for teachers in traditionally more compliant East Asian schools, this would be different in the UK. He said: &quot;You can&apos;t separate out teacher quality from the social context.

The report into the downing of the plane over eastern Ukraine does not apportion blame or say a missile was fired. But the Dutch Safety Board (DSB) says: &quot;There are no indications that the MH17 crash was caused by a technical fault or by actions of the crew.&quot; The Boeing 777 was blown up in mid-air on 17 July over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 passengers and crew on board. The black boxes were retrieved intact, with the flight recorders showing a completely normal flight before impact. Radio communications with Ukrainian air traffic control confirm that no emergency call was made by the cockpit crew. The pattern of wreckage on the ground suggests that the aircraft split into pieces during flight. The report shows how easily a different airliner could have met the fate of the doomed plane instead, had the crew of MH17 been able to comply with a controller&apos;s request to fly higher in the minutes before it was shot down. Air traffic controllers were attempting to clear traffic as three other commercial flights, unidentified in the report, were in the vicinity \u2013 two other Boeing 777s and one Airbus A330. At 12.53pm, Ukrainian air traffic controllers at Dnipropetrovsk asked MH17 to climb 2,000 feet to flight level 350 over eastern Ukraine, in accordance with the original flight plan, to clear a &quot;potential separation conflict&quot; with another Boeing 777. The crew said they were unable to comply, possibly due to weather. Instead, at least one other plane climbed higher. Just after 1pm the crew, running into bad weather, requested to climb to 34,000 feet \u2013 although air traffic control said the plane should keep at the same altitude. At 1.20pm, MH17 exploded in mid-air. The other plane was not identified by investigators but it is known that a large Singapore Airlines jet, many of which are 777s, was nearby. Kiev and the west have accused pro-Russia separatists of shooting down the plane with a surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow. Russia, which denies mounting western claims of direct involvement in the five-month conflict in Ukraine, has blamed government forces for the attack. Russia, Ukraine, the US, the UK, Malaysia and Australia were all given the politically sensitive report for review, and investigators say they have since amended it before publication. The report is being issued just days after a ceasefire backed by Kiev and Moscow came into force on Friday to try to end a war that has killed more than 2,700 people and led to at least half a million fleeing their homes. Tjibbe Joustra, chairman of the DSB, said: &quot;The MH17 crash has shocked the world and raised many questions. The Dutch Safety Board wishes to determine the cause of the crash, for the sake of the loved ones of the victims and for society at large. &quot;The initial results of the investigation point towards an external cause of the MH17 crash. More research will be necessary to determine the cause with greater precision. The safety board believes that additional evidence will become available for investigation in the period ahead.&quot; The plane was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was destroyed. Most of the victims were Dutch, with 193 of the 283 passengers and 15 crew who died coming from the Netherlands. Last week the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, said he wanted to dispatch more investigators to eastern Ukraine before winter to gather more evidence. The search has been suspended for a month because of the continuing conflict in the area.

The annual education report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) notes the &quot;quantum leap&quot; the UK has made in higher education access \u2013 for the first time, more people now gain a university or college qualification than have GCSEs or A-levels as their highest qualification. However, it says this has not been wholly matched by better skills, or by increased social mobility. Andreas Schleicher, director of education and skills for the Paris-based club of industrialised nations, said it was notable that while the UK had a high proportion of people with university or college qualifications \u2013 for 2012 it ranked eighth among 36 countries listed \u2013 the skill level for graduates was only average. The increasing availability of degree courses means that for the first time the proportion of working age people with a university or college qualification, now 41% of the total, outnumbers the 37% who finished their education at 16 or 18. The 566-page report, somewhat hopefully titled Education at a Glance, also highlights the relatively low impact on social mobility brought by the UK&apos;s revolution in higher education. The study ranks countries by comparing the number of people with better educational attainment than their parents against those who achieved lower qualifications. This league table places England and Northern Ireland combined at a relatively lowly 15th out of 23 countries listed, though still above wealthy nations such as Germany and Austria. Comparing for the first time the OECD&apos;s own skills tests against qualification levels, the organisation found 25% of university- and college-educated people in England and Northern Ireland \u2013 the only parts of the UK with comparable data \u2013 reached the top attainment levels for literacy, more or less the OECD average. In contrast, 32% of better-educated Australians attained that level, while the figures were 36% in the Netherlands and 37% in Japan and Finland. One possible explanation for this was the variability of post-school qualifications, said Schleicher. &quot;Not all further education qualifications really deserve that name, because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than people who have just passed school,&quot; he said. Nonetheless, he added, the skills gap, which is even bigger when numeracy is tested, was a puzzle given the stellar reputation of many UK universities, which draw disproportionate numbers of foreign students paying significant fees for the privilege.     Education2 WEB 100914    Schleicher said it could be partly the fault of UK schools. &quot;One of the things which may of course be true is that literacy and numeracy reflect things that you learn well before university. In Japan they build the foundations for literacy and numeracy at high school, and universities can build on this. It&apos;s not true for the UK. This may be a reflection of this \u2013 universities assume those skills are there, but they might not be.&quot; Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said the sector recognised complaints from some employers about graduates&apos; skills, and argued that some of this was down to schooling. She added: &quot;However, higher education can have a role in developing students in key areas of employability.&quot; Universities were addressing this challenge, she said, in part through increased links with employers such as work placements. Schleicher said: &quot;Access and social mobility are not the same thing. The UK has seen a huge increase is access, but it has not translated into a degree of mobility you see in places like Finland, Korea, the Russian Federation and so on.&quot; The report notes the relatively significant UK investment in education overall. Despite the tricky financial climate, it found that from 2008-11 the UK increased public spending in education as a proportion of national income by a greater figure than any other OECD nation. With university funding, Schleicher said, the system of students taking out publicly backed loans to pay for tuition appeared to strike a good balance between access and financial viability, even though the report only considers data up to 2011, just before annual maximum fees were raised to \u00a39,000. &quot;The UK is one the very few countries that has figured out a sustainable approach to higher education funding,&quot; he said. Despite the cost, the report argues, university education in the UK remains a good investment, with the career premium for graduates totalling about $250,000 (\u00a3155,000), and bringing an extra $130,000 (\u00a380,000) in tax receipts for the government. &quot;One of the most compelling outcomes from this is that the increase in university education has not seen a decline in pay,&quot; said Schleicher, noting regular warnings of an imminent glut of British graduates. &quot;It simply hasn&apos;t happened, year after year after year,&quot; he said. &quot;So far it seems it seems that the demand for better skills is rising faster than supply.&quot; panel on class sizes to go with pweduoecd Peter Walker For many years British governments of all stripes have boasted of efforts to cut class sizes.

But, you generally need to bring in more teachers to raise more classes. &quot;It&apos;s crucial how good those extra teachers are. If they&apos;re in the bottom 10% then class size reduction actually makes things worse. You get an extra four months&apos; learning per year from the smaller class sizes, but you close five months&apos; learning per year because now you&apos;ve got so many bad teachers in the system. It&apos;s really hard to predict how this will play out in a different country.&quot; hile controlling larger classes might be easier for teachers in traditionally more compliant East Asian schools, this would be different in the UK. He said: &quot;You can&apos;t separate out teacher quality from the social context. Larger classes in much of the UK would be disastrous because the student behaviour would be so poor, which is not a problem they have in the high-performing countries.&quot; A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it had &quot;a range of measures in place to identify and resolve quality issues identified in higher education institutions&quot;. He added: &quot;This report reinforces the UK&apos;s reputation as a true world leader in higher education, and confirms that a university degree is an excellent return on investment for the individual and for the country&apos;s economic growth. However we cannot be complacent in the face of growing international competition.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/09/mh17-destroyed-instant-high-energy-objects-report", "sentences": ["These other planes were not identified by investigators but it is known that a large Singapore Airlines jet was nearby."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-09T18:58:11Z", "title": "MH17 destroyed in instant by 'number of high-energy objects', says report", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Ukraine", "Plane crashes", "Netherlands"], "article": "Malaysia Airlines flight 17 was destroyed in an instant when the cockpit and other parts of the fuselage were peppered by &quot;a large number of high-energy objects,&quot; causing the plane to break apart over eastern Ukraine before anyone could raise an alarm, according to a preliminary report on the disaster which was released on Tuesday. The report by the Dutch Safety Board (DSB), does not speculate on the origin or nature of objects, noting its investigators have not been able to visit the crash site because their security could not be guaranteed in the midst of the conflict between Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatist forces. The findings are consistent with US and Ukrainian assertions the Boeing 777, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was brought down by an anti-aircraft missile, which they say was provided by Russia. However, some air-to-air missiles also have fragmentation warheads which spray small shrapnel when they detonate close to a target. The DSB report rules out other possible causes for the crash, which killed all 298 people on board, saying: &quot;There are no indications that the MH17 crash was caused by a technical fault or by actions of the crew.&quot; It found that the shrapnel came from outside the plane and hit the cockpit above the level of the floor, implying it sheared through the space occupied by the pilots. The front parts of the plane broke away first, leaving the rest of the aircraft to fly on for some distance, with parts of the rear and centre ending up miles further east than the cockpit. The US and Ukraine have accused separatists of shooting down the plane with a surface-to-air BUK missile, which explodes near its target, peppering it with high-velocity shrapnel. Moscow has denied the charge, pointing instead at the Ukrainian air force. Rebel leaders have by turns admitted and denied possessing a BUK system. On Monday Alexander Zakharchenko, the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&apos;s Republic, told Russia&apos;s Interfax new agency: &quot;We simply do not have the military hardware capable of shooting down a Boeing passenger jet such as the Malaysian plane.&quot; The Dutch board was given the lead in drawing up the report because 193 of the 283 passengers and 15 crew who died came from the Netherlands. Russia, Ukraine, the US, the UK, Malaysia and Australia were all given the politically sensitive report for review. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said: &quot;We have to guard against drawing premature conclusions. The case is still wide open.&quot; According to the report, the plane&apos;s black boxes \u2013 the flight data recorder and digital cockpit voice recorder \u2013 both stopped at 20 seconds past 1.20pm. No alerts or alarms can be heard or any sign of distress. The last voice communication from the cockpit came 24 seconds earlier \u2013 an acknowledgement of the latest routine course instructions from air traffic control. Unable to raise MH17, Dnipropetrovsk asked the next air traffic control centre along the route, at Rostov, if it could see the plane on its screens. Controllers replied: &quot;No, it seems that its target started falling apart.&quot; As the plane approached eastern Ukraine at 12.53pm, responsibility for its flight path passed to air traffic control at Dnipropetrovsk. The controllers asked the pilots to climb from 33,000ft to 35,000ft to stick to the original flight plan and to keep away from other airliners in the area. Air traffic controllers were attempting to clear traffic as three other commercial flights, unidentified in the report, were in the vicinity \u2013 two other Boeing 777s and one Airbus A330. These other planes were not identified by investigators but it is known that a large Singapore Airlines jet was nearby. The MH17 told air traffic control &quot;were unable to comply&quot; with the request to gain altitude and asked instead to stay at 33,000ft. The reason for this is not spelled out, but it could be because of weather: there were some thunderstorms in the area. In fact, at 13.00, according to the report, the flight turned slightly to the left &quot;due to weather&quot;. The crew then asked to climb to 34,000ft, but air traffic control said the plane should keep at the same altitude. Twenty minutes later it was brought down. Air traffic restrictions had been in force over eastern Ukraine since 1 July because of the conflict. As of 14 July, the minimum altitude for commercial airliners was raised to 32,000ft. MH17 was flying 1,000ft above that. About 90 minutes after the downing of MH17, Ukrainian air traffic restrictions over eastern Ukraine were changed to stop civilian airliners flying over at any altitude. The question raised by the tragedy, but not explicitly framed in this report, is whether all civilian aircraft should have been banned at all altitudes, given the presence of powerful anti-aircraft missiles in the region. International aviation organisations have since set up a task force to review how restrictions are set, in light of the disaster. Kiev and the west have accused pro-Russia separatists of shooting down the plane with a surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow. Russia, which denies mounting western claims of direct involvement in the five-month conflict in Ukraine, has blamed government forces for the attack. The chairman of the DSB, Tjibbe Joustra, said: &quot;The MH17 crash has shocked the world and raised many questions. The Dutch Safety Board wishes to determine the cause of the crash, for the sake of the loved ones of the victims and for society at large. &quot;The initial results of the investigation point towards an external cause of the MH17 crash. More research will be necessary to determine the cause with greater precision. The safety board believes that additional evidence will become available for investigation in the period ahead.&quot; The investigators aim to publish the final report by July 2015. The report is being issued just days after a ceasefire backed by Kiev and Moscow came into force on Friday to try to end a war that has killed more than 2,700 people and led to at least half a million fleeing their homes. On Monday the EU agreed new sanctions against Moscow, barring Russia&apos;s largest state-owned oil and defence firms from using European markets to raise capital and impose more asset freezes and travel bans on officials. It was the latest in successive waves of punitive measures since the downing of MH17, imposed because of Russian support for eastern Ukrainian separatists, but the new sanctions will only come into affect once the EU have assessed the implementation of the ceasefire."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/10/ferrari-face-difficult-future-resignation-luca-di-montezemolo", "sentences": ["They have not won pole position since the 2012 British Grand Prix and last qualified at the front of the grid in dry conditions in Singapore, 2010."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-10T14:53:46Z", "title": "Ferrari\u2019s bleak run unlikely to end with Luca Di Montezemolo resignation | Paul Weaver", "tags": ["Ferrari", "Formula One 2014", "Fiat", "Automotive industry", "Business", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "The resignation of Luca Di Montezemolo as Ferrari president, coupled with the news of the death of the Santander chairman Emilio Bot\u00edn, will intensify the widespread speculation concerning the biggest team in Formula One. The less than surprising departure of Di Montezemolo brings a gilded curtain down on one of the sport\u2019s most commanding figures. He has headed Ferrari for 23 years. Perhaps only Enzo Ferrari himself had a greater stature at Maranello. At the high risk of offending the passionate tifosi who follow their beloved Ferrari team, the monolithic parent Fiat company has bigger fish to fry than motor sport, and the departure of Di Montezemolo at the grand age of 67 \u2013 as he said himself \u2013 had much to do with the flotation plans of the new Fiat Chrysler Automobiles company on Wall Street. But followers of Formula One will still link his resignation with a bleak epoch in the team\u2019s history, culminating in an awful performance in Sunday\u2019s Italian Grand Prix, their worst since 2005. In the biggest race of the year for Ferrari, Fernando Alonso failed to finish, his first mechanical DNF for five years, and Kimi Raikkonen came a distant ninth; before the disappointing race the drivers had qualified seventh and 12th. The Fiat CEO, Sergio Marchionne, who replaces Di Montezemolo, also mentioned problems with the Formula One team when he said: \u201cLuca and I have discussed the future of Ferrari at length. And our mutual desire to see Ferrari achieve its true potential on the track has led to misunderstandings which became clearly visible over the last weekend. For the last six years we have struggled like hell despite the best drivers.\u201d Ferrari are fourth in the constructors\u2019 championship, behind the budget-hampered Williams and 292 points behind the leaders, Mercedes. They have not won pole position since the 2012 British Grand Prix and last qualified at the front of the grid in dry conditions in Singapore, 2010. That is some contrast to the first half-dozen years of the century, when they were dominant with Michael Schumacher. Their results in recent years have been a lot better than they should have been because of Alonso, who is probably the best all-round driver in the paddock. But Alonso, frustrated in his efforts to add to his two world championships, has been critical of Ferrari and his position at the team is less than comfortable.              He has a contract until the end of 2016. But unless there is a considerable improvement in the performance of the car, he is expected to quit next year, perhaps for McLaren, who are desperate to sign him as they embark on a new era with the Honda engine. Raikkonen, meanwhile, has been a failure in his second stint with the Italian outfit. In a statement released on Wednesday, Di Montezemolo said: \u201cThis is the end of an era and so I have decided to leave my position as chairman after almost 23 marvellous and unforgettable years, in addition to those spent at Enzo Ferrari\u2019s side in the 1970s. \u201cMy thanks, first and foremost, to the exceptional Ferrari women and men from the factory, the offices, race tracks and markets across the world. They were the real architects of the company\u2019s spectacular growth, its unforgettable victories and its transformation into one of the world\u2019s strongest brands.\u201d Next year will be huge for the British designer James Allison. He is highly regarded but joined the team from Lotus late last year, when the current car had already been designed. Ferrari\u2019s new team principal, Marco Mattiacci, is likely to continue in charge. But there has been so much blood spilled on the Maranello carpet in the past year that more casualties would surprise no one. Meanwhile, Santander\u2019s sponsorship of Ferrari is vast \u2013 essentially, it makes Alonso the best-paid driver in Formula One. Bot\u00edn\u2019s death will not end that sponsorship, which has years to run. But it will create more uncertainly in the future. Ron Dennis, executive chairman and CEO of the McLaren Group, who also receive sponsorship from Santander, said: \u201cEveryone at McLaren is shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden passing of Emilio Bot\u00edn. He was a consummate businessman who made Santander what it is today. \u201cPassionate and charming, he was firm but always fair. I feel privileged to have known him, and proud to be able to call him a friend. He adored motor racing \u2013 there was no one more enthusiastic in the McLaren garage than he was when a race win was in the offing. The world has lost a great man. To his large and loving family, I send my condolences.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/sep/11/-sp-to-hull-and-back-the-rebirth-of-britains-poorest-city", "sentences": ["\u201cI wasn\u2019t on the invite list,\u201d says Brady wryly, \u201cbut the fact is, Osborne felt it was important to be here with \u00a3100m of investment by Reckitts when they could\u2019ve gone anywhere \u2013 Singapore or anywhere else."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-11T13:25:00Z", "title": "To Hull and back: the rebirth of Britain\u2019s poorest city", "tags": ["Cities", "Urbanisation", "UK news", "Economics", "Business", "Economic recovery", "Fishing", "Environment", "Hull", "Wind power", "Communities", "Society", "Regeneration"], "article": "Philip Larkin liked Hull, he once said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s so far from everywhere else. On the way to nowhere, as somebody put it. It\u2019s in the middle of the lonely country, and beyond the lonely country there is only the sea.\u201d Growing up within the Hull postcode, travelling into the city to patronise its guitar shops and nightclubs and dealers in motorbike spares, I never felt the city was a nowhere \u2013 but looking out across the Alexandra Dock on a summer afternoon, it is easy to appreciate the Coventry-born poet\u2019s view. This is where the lonely country meets the sea, or at least the estuary. Today, the Bahamas-registered Arco Dijk lies in the dock\u2019s thick-walled embrace, moored by cables the width of a labourer\u2019s arm, its rusting blue flanks lapped by the fine orange soup of the Humber. To the east, the low Holderness coast tails off into the long sandbar of Spurn Point, crowned by its lighthouses and isolated RNLI station. Around the dock\u2019s landward side, meanwhile, are the sparsely populated acres of the Port of Hull: warehouses half-filled with aggregates and animal feed, paper and piles of plastic-wrapped timber from Scandinavia, waiting to be hauled somewhere else.     Hull\u2019s fishing harbour in busier times. Some 6,000 men lost their lives in 150 years of trawling.  Photograph: Don McPhee/Guardian Archive    \u201cIt\u2019s pretty quiet now,\u201d says Rev Cameron Macdonald, and indeed it is. A former army chaplain with close-cropped hair and punkish ear studs, Macdonald runs the Mission to Seafarers in the Humber, ministering to the mostly Filipino, Indian and eastern European crews who populate the world\u2019s merchant ships. He is referring to the Hull mission, which is empty this morning, and perhaps also to the season, but his words could be used to describe the past several decades in the city. Before the 1970s, these wharves would have been crowded with ships and dockers, some knee-deep in the vessels\u2019 holds, shovelling, hauling and rolling Britain\u2019s imports ashore and her exports aboard. Hull was at one time the UK\u2019s third largest port, and if work here was hard (a \u201cbloody, godawful occupation\u201d, according to one local), it was at least employment. The shipping container, the fork-lift truck and privatisation changed all that, as a stack of the rusting steel boxes and the solitary driver of a loader testify. If automation dealt a huge blow to the dockers in the east of the city, in the west the 1970s Cod War killed off the other Hull industry: fishing (the city has always split between the docks and the trawling; each community even has its own rugby league team). \u201cHull built all its wealth on the fishing industry, and on whaling before that,\u201d says Alan Johnson, the former home secretary and MP for West Hull and Hessle. \u201cIt took a terrible toll. There were 6,000 men lost in 150 years of trawling out of Hull. Nine hundred ships didn\u2019t come back. It\u2019s an amazing carnage \u2026 an industry that had a mortality rate 17 times higher than coal mining. But it was a way of life and it employed thousands of people and thousands in the fish processing industry.\u201d Even 40 years on, there is a palpable sense of pride in the city\u2019s fishing past: hundreds still turn out every year on the old fish dock for the memorial service for trawlermen lost at sea.     A fisherman on the River Humber, by Alexandra Dock. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian    Hull\u2019s double blow began a long decline that left it by some measures the poorest city in Britain, ranking near the bottom of every indicator of UK socio-economic wealth. When I ask Naomi Clayton of the Centre for Cities where Hull fits in the national picture, she produces a set of damning statistics. It it is bottom of the 2009 economic prosperity index and built environment index. It has the lowest rate of employment and the highest proportion of people claiming Job Seekers\u2019 Allowance (6.9% to a UK average of 3.0%). It is Britain\u2019s poorest city in terms of weekly wage. It has a major skills shortage, low rates of business startup, a high crime rate and the lowest percentage of residents with NVQ4 qualifications or above. Its housing stock is dirt-cheap: in July the average Hull property sold for \u00a369,000, compared with \u00a3188,000 in nearby York. Perhaps because of its isolation, Hull has had little sympathy. The common reaction from outside the city is scorn: in 2003 it was named Britain\u2019s most \u201cCrap Town\u201d by the Idler magazine, while newspaper wags down the years have commonly cited the lines \u201cfrom Hull, from Hell, from Halifax \u2026 Good Lord, deliver us\u201d, as if this 17th-century poem were evidence of the city\u2019s eternal damnation. Little was done by central government to alleviate Hull\u2019s suffering: \u201cIt was a terrible tragedy,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cHull was promised compensation, reskilling, all these things, but none of it ever materialised. People working 18 hours on and six hours off were classed as casual labour and got statutory redundancy. In a sense, that is what Hull is still living with.\u201d      Hull docks today. Automation dealt a hammer blow to the dockers \u2013 but the wind farm investment has given the area a new sense of optimism .  Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian    In 2014, however, there is a new sense of optimism about the city, a feeling that the bottom of the decline may have been hit and the indicators can only move up. The hope is centred on Alexandra Dock. In two years\u2019 time, this expanse of silt-filled water and concrete will be transformed into Green Port Hull, a service hub for the giant wind farms being built in the North Sea. Siemens and Associated British Ports will initially invest \u00a3310m on a wind turbine facility in the city that will build and service the UK\u2019s massive Round 3 offshore wind programme. Five miles downriver at Paull, Siemens plans to manufacture the turbines\u2019 blades, which will be carried on a purpose-built private railway to the Green Port for partial assembly. From here, ships will steam east for 12 hours to the arrays at Dogger, Hornsea and East Anglia, where the giant windmills \u2013 each of which will stand taller than the Eiffel Tower \u2013 will be installed. The Siemens/ABP money is the biggest single investment Hull has ever seen, and promises to bring with it a host of support industries and work for contractors, but it is just part of a broader development in Hull and the Humber: a second major renewable energy development worth half a billion pounds is expected to be built on the south bank of the river by Able ports.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian    \u201cThis is big, big stuff,\u201d says Chris Haskins, the crossbench peer who chairs Humber Local Enterprise Partnership and who coined the phrase \u201cenergy estuary\u201d to capture the Humber\u2019s new economy. \u201cAnd we\u2019re still counting, because there\u2019s another \u00a3300m in the pipeline which may or may not come, never mind \u00a3500m on the south bank. I would say you can probably talk about 3,000 jobs on the north bank in the Hull area in the next four or five years.\u201d Hull, according to Johnson, is on the verge of a windrush. \u201cIt\u2019s like oil to Aberdeen,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don\u2019t mean that as an exaggeration.\u201d The weight of the past is oppressive in the Guildhall, a baroque-style tour de force on Alfred Gelder Street that houses the city council and the law courts. The ground floor is stuffed with statues of the wealthy and powerful of earlier eras, when Hull\u2019s grand buildings were thrown up on the back of profits dragged out of the sea. I am directed past a newly restored and painted statue of Edward I, the king who in 1299 gave Kingston upon Hull its name and a royal charter, up a sweeping staircase to a landing adorned with glass cabinets heaving with silverware \u2013 a cup bearing the name of former mayor Sir Henry Cooper; a ceremonial silver trowel used to break the ground for the Guildhall \u2013 and down an apparently endless, dark-panelled corridor into a room that carries the lingering smell of cigarette smoke.     Cllr Steve Brady, Hull city council leader at the Guildhall. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian    Council chief Stephen Brady has the build of a bantamweight and is referred to only as \u201cthe leader\u201d by Mark Jones, a second Labour councillor who settles on the black leather furniture. Brady is suited, his shoelaces knotted carefully in a double bow; despite the city\u2019s reputation for producing Old Labour warhorses, his words are carefully chosen. It has been a remarkable six months, says Brady, so remarkable that Hull has had a hard time believing its own good fortune. \u201cThe city in general was very sceptical [of getting the Siemens contract],\u201d he says. \u201cThey felt this didn\u2019t happen to places like Hull. And in a sense it isn\u2019t the be-all and end-all, but the huge swell of confidence from that decision has greatly affected the mindset of the schools, the universities, and opened the eyes of other businesses looking to invest in the area. So, yes, confidence-wise it has been a huge boost.\u201d The key factor in Siemens\u2019 decision to come to Hull was geography \u2013 \u201cPurely location,\u201d says Jones, who did more than many to win the bid, \u201cand the scale of the investment in the North Sea\u201d \u2013 but it was also because of the relationship the council built with the German engineering company. \u201cWe realised we\u2019ve got to try to dig ourselves out and move the city forward, Brady says. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown we\u2019re not saying \u2018Poor Me\u2019, we\u2019re actually getting down to it. We\u2019re confident and we feel that certainly in 10 years\u2019 time, this city will be totally different to how it is now. We are going to show the major companies that investing in Hull is the right thing for them and will produce good returns for investors.\u201d      An artist\u2019s impression of the proposed offshore wind project construction assembly and service facility at Green Port Hull. Photograph: Siemens/PA    The week before my visit, George Osborne was in Hull for the announcement by Reckitt-Benckiser of a \u00a3100m investment in a research and development facility in the city. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on the invite list,\u201d says Brady wryly, \u201cbut the fact is, Osborne felt it was important to be here with \u00a3100m of investment by Reckitts when they could\u2019ve gone anywhere \u2013 Singapore or anywhere else. That was another boost.\u201d And in November last year, Hull was the surprise winner of the UK City of Culture 2017, reckoned to be worth \u00a360m to the economy. Even the city\u2019s football team, Hull City, has started to perform, playing European football this season for the first time in its history.   The day when Hull won the City of Culture bid produced an \u201cunbelievable\u201d feeling in the city, says Brady. \u201cPeople who probably didn\u2019t know what it meant were punching the air. There wouldn\u2019t be many places where you got everybody on the buses and taxis and on the estates, all talking about how proud the city was to have beaten off the competition from 14 or 15 applicants \u2013 from being rank outsiders \u2013 to land this, and that has had a big feeling of confidence in the city centre.\u201d  \u201cTimes have been pretty tough for Hull in the past 25 to 30 years,\u201d says Jones, \u201cBut this has really switched the mindset from managing decline to managing growth. It is a fantastic place to be and, as the leader says, the optimism in the city \u2013 despite the fact it hasn\u2019t arrived yet, things haven\u2019t changed yet \u2013 is absolutely there.\u201d           A Hull city council video promoting the successful city of culture bid.    Growing up eight miles away in Beverley, the county town of East Yorkshire, Hull was \u2013 still is \u2013 derided for being badly run and poorly educated. Partly this was what Johnson calls \u201csnobbishness\u201d, partly natural political tension between the Tory-voting, middle-class shire and the Labour-voting, working-class city (with the exception of a period of Liberal Democrat control of the council in the 2000s, Hull has consistently voted in Labour MPs and councils for half a century). In the 1970s and 1980s, Hull was nevertheless where county people went to do things: to work and shop; watch films at the ABC and the Cecil; go to exotic Italian or Indian restaurants; pass a few hours at the bowling alley. We went there to spend money.  One effect of the city\u2019s decades of decline is that the class and welfare divisions have grown: more of the people with the high-paying Hull jobs now live in the county, but fewer of them come to the city to spend what they earn there. It would be easy to read this as a the county\u2019s gain and Hull\u2019s loss, but it has a negative effect on the county too: development in the East Riding has massively expanded and the green spaces around Beverley have filled up, even as Hull\u2019s population has declined and its property stock stagnated. Driving through the northern outskirts of the city, once wealthy pockets such as Pearson Park, where Larkin lived for 18 years in an attic flat, appear frayed, and grand buildings on Beverley and Anlaby Roads are derelict. In the once-prestigious streets in the centre, the few remaining prestige shops to have survived from the 1970s appear to be struggling in a sea of bookmakers, cheap loans providers, discount clothes stores and open-all-hours pubs.     Humber Street in Hull. After a multimillion pound redevelopment plan collapsed during the latest recession the council handed the area over to the creative sector.  Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian     For tangible signs of a Hull renaissance I walk across the A63 from the city centre to Humber Street. Until four years ago this road was home to the city\u2019s fruit and veg market; it has a shabby urban chic, reminiscent of the run-down inner city quarters where artists settle because it\u2019s cheap, and which then become hip and expensive. Within a few blocks are a microbrewery, art galleries, graphic designers, vintage furniture shops, a stonemason, a jeweller, a \u201cMuseum of Club Culture\u201d and a digital media centre, C4Di.  Rob Moore, a former dean of Hull College of Art who runs the Studio Eleven gallery in the street with his business partner Adele Howitt, was one of the first to move into the area. In the run-up to the City of Culture award, Moore became something of a poster-boy for the city\u2019s cultural regeneration. His small, well-stocked gallery has been visited by a succession of arts dignitaries, from Maria Miller, who was then culture secretary, to the BBC director general Tony Hall and the City of Culture judges, led by Phil Redmond.  As the councillors admit, the Humber Street cultural quarter exists partly by accident, after a multimillion pound plan to clear the area and redevelop it collapsed during the latest recession. The council handed the area over to the creative sector: \u201cThe council had a big meeting and asked for ideas and bids for using buildings and about 200 people turned up,\u201d Moore says. \u201cAbout eight of us got into buildings, and the council spread what little money they had round to make them safe. I think all of us that got in four years ago have survived and we\u2019re flourishing as a little cultural community within the area. The thing that enabled us to be here were some far-sighted councillors who gave us great support and low rents.\u201d It is now a pocket of thriving enterprise of exactly the type that most cities crave. Winning the City of Culture bid was, Moore says, \u201ca great surprise but a huge achievement. And it\u2019s the sort of place that needs it.\u201d The judges liked the fact that when they talked to people in the city, they were clearly aware of the bid. \u201cI don\u2019t think they got the same response in Leicester,\u201d he says. Rosie Millard, the former BBC arts journalist, is chairing the City of Culture company with Martin Green, who ran the opening ceremony of the Tour de France in Leeds, as chief executive. The programme, inspired by Larkin\u2019s poem \u201cDays\u201d, will include an event every day of 2017, an idea Moore describes as \u201cbrilliant, really simple\u201d.     Cover of The Housemartins\u2019 album London 0 Hull 4 Photograph: internet    Music was historically one of Hull\u2019s strengths, with the city producing bands from the Housemartins and Everything But the Girl to Fine Young Cannibals and, more recently, the Paddingtons. It remains the city\u2019s true love, Moore says, and in summer the council holds festivals in the Humber Street area: more than 40,000 people attend the Humber Street Sesh festival, which had 180 bands performing on pop-up stages, as well as theatre groups, dancers and comedians. The Freedom festival, which celebrates the work of Hull\u2019s abolitionist MP William Wilberforce, attract similarly large numbers. The theatre company Hull Truck also has a national profile, and has moved into a flashy new glass-and-steel structure by the station, and there is a strong tradition of ballet and contemporary dance. \u201cHull has got a real quirky cultural offering and a lot of it has been underground,\u201d Moore says. \u201cThe visual arts \u2013 apart from the wonderful Ferens Art Gallery, which I think is one of the best provincial art galleries \u2013 was always pretty low key, and places found it hard to survive. But there were again quirky things like [the artists collective] Hull Time Based Arts, which was strong for several years.\u201d The city\u2019s cultural life and its economy are directly connected, Moore says. \u201cI think everything interrelates: if a big company moves a big investment into a city, people aren\u2019t going to want to relocate here unless there\u2019s a social, cultural life to become part of. From my limited knowledge of big companies, it\u2019s really important if they\u2019re going to attract some quality skills to the business.\u201d Humber Street is a small, fragile basis from which to regenerate the city, not least because as money has returned to the economy, a new developer has taken control of the site. Brady tells me the new masterplan for the area will be \u201csympathetic\u201d and retain its character, but initial plans included knocking down the back of Moore\u2019s gallery, which he says would make it unviable. The developers\u2019 proposals have other advantages, though, such as putting housing back into the area, which would create a mixed-use quarter that could be \u201cfantastic\u201d. \u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the culturally minded people in the city council still maintain an interest and can fight off the obvious conflicting interest, like turning it into chains, Costa Coffee and all the rest,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI guess they\u2019ve got some tricky decisions to make. I think it would be a shame for Hull if some of the people like us and others who are not for profit don\u2019t make it to 2017.\u201d The point of 2017 will, he says, be all about generating some longer-term interest in the city, and his only worry is that it will leave no legacy: \u201cMy fear is that once the circus leaves town, we\u2019re not just left cleaning up the elephant dung for the next two years.\u201d     Offshore wind farms could bring to Hull what oil has brought to Aberdeen. Photograph: John Lawson/FlickrVision    Will it be enough? Or has too much damage been done? When I ask Clayton of the Centre for Cities if this could be Hull\u2019s transformative moment, she stoically resists optimism, talking instead about \u201clong-term trends\u201d being extremely hard to turn around. But surely the City of Culture year could provide a boost, as it did in Liverpool or Glasgow? Clayton cites an academic study that shows major cultural events have little effect on the local economy, and can even have a net negative effect on sentiment. Macdonald is also pessimistic: there is an ingrained, and understandable, \u201cbelieve-it-when-I-see-it\u201d scepticism. \u201cPeople think they\u2019re forgotten,\u201d he says. But the people who are closest to Hull business have few doubts. Haskins acknowledges the challenges, but is adamant that the uptick in the city\u2019s economy has begun already. \u201cIt\u2019s taken off, no question. Hull is showing definite signs of recovery: house prices are moving up and the unemployment figures are coming down quicker than the national average, which is pretty encouraging \u2013 and this is before any of the Siemens bite has taken place. The Siemens thing is big, and it\u2019s sort of given people a degree of confidence that they didn\u2019t have before. It\u2019s slow \u2026 nothing is going to change very rapidly, but it is changing.\u201d And the much-discussed skills shortage? Haskins says it was a product of the apprenticeship system largely bypassing Hull; here, starting work for young men meant simply heading down to the boats or the docks to take their chances. \u201cBut Siemens are very confident they can fix it, and they will fix it,\u201d he adds.     Alan Johnson, the former home secretary and MP for West Hull and Hessle. Photograph: Richard Saker    Johnson, meanwhile, believes the Siemens investment and the things that come with it are the best thing to happen to Hull for a long time: \u201cIt was national news, but here it was just amazing. Will it replace the fishing? Theoretically there will be as many jobs coming out of this and everything else it brings with it as there were in the fishing industry.  \u201cThe university will gain out of the marine biology of it, all the support industries will gain from it. The [turbine] blades are currently being made in Denmark and they are bringing them over and encouraging all their tier-one suppliers to come with them. The company that builds the towers are Korean, and I\u2019ll be very surprised if they don\u2019t move here as well. And unlike an industry where you didn\u2019t need any qualifications, it\u2019s an industry where you do. These are good, high-quality, well-paid manufacturing jobs. And there is absolutely no doubt that Siemens\u2019s whole record, wherever they\u2019ve located, has not been to bring people in from overseas. They want to grow their own skills here.\u201d The wind energy boom is not the only thing Hull has going for it, says Johnson, reeling off a list of other areas of strengths in the city, from biomass to bioeffluent to digital culture and the computer games sector. It is, however, the main thing. There is a certain symmetry to Hull again putting its faith in the one great resource that has provided for it over the years: the North Sea. \u201cIt is almost poetic,\u201d Johnson says. Moore, meanwhile, senses the city has become more upbeat: \u201cI think when I first came to work here many years ago, there was still a lot of doom and gloom about it, it\u2019s part of the psyche really.\u201d Now, in all quarters, he thinks people are more optimistic. \u201cI think there\u2019s less looking back now, and a bit more looking forward.\u201d  Riding Beijing\u2019s subway end to end: 88km of queues and crushes on a 20p ticket  "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/sep/12/breakthrough-in-rapid-diagnostics-using-magnets-to-test-for-malaria", "sentences": ["A team of scientists in Singapore have created a new way to test for malaria within minutes using magnets.", "\u201cSince this technique does not rely on expensive labelling with chemical reagents, we are able to get individual diagnostic tests carried out at a cost of less than 10 cents,\u201d says Weng Kung Peng, lead author of the paper and research scientist at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-12T09:40:52Z", "title": "Breakthrough in rapid diagnostics: using magnets to test for malaria", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Malaria and infectious diseases - global development professionals network", "Malaria", "Infectious diseases", "Research and development", "Technology", "Science", "Medical research", "Microbiology", "Biology", "Health", "Singapore"], "article": "A team of scientists in Singapore have created a new way to test for malaria within minutes using magnets. \u201cThe new technique uses a significantly smaller blood sample to traditional blood-smear methods, and is more sensitive and less error-prone,\u201d says Donhee Ham, professor of electrical engineering at Harvard University. Malaria currently infects over 200 million people worldwide, mainly in developing countries. This new technology could allow hospitals to rapidly screen and monitor patients for malaria at a significantly lower cost per patient, and may be portable enough to be used in the field.  So, how does it work? Currently malaria is diagnosed by taking a blood sample from a patient, staining it with a dye, and looking at the sample with a microscope to detect the Plasmodium parasite which causes the disease. This new technique uses magnetic resonance relaxometry (MRR) to detect a parasitic waste in the blood of infected patients. \u201cThere is real potential to make this into a field-deployable system, since you don\u2019t need any kind of labels or dye,\u201d says Jongyoon Han, one of the senior authors of the paper. The researchers used a small, 0.5-tesla magnet. The current device prototype is small enough to sit on a lab bench, but the team is also working on a portable version for field-based diagnoses. After taking a blood sample, the analysis takes less than a minute. Only a droplet of blood is needed, making the procedure much less invasive for patients and easier for healthcare workers. Will it be expensive? No. According to researchers the system can be built at a very low cost. \u201cSince this technique does not rely on expensive labelling with chemical reagents, we are able to get individual diagnostic tests carried out at a cost of less than 10 cents,\u201d says Weng Kung Peng, lead author of the paper and research scientist at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.  Is it more reliable than past tests? In the blood-smear test, the blood is stained with a dye that colours cell nuclei. As red blood cells don\u2019t have nuclei, any marks that show up are presumed to be from the parasite. The problem is that technicians don\u2019t always agree on the interpretation of the smears. According to Hans, there\u2019s a lot of variation over what counts as infected red blood cells rather than dust particles stuck on the plate: \u201cIt really takes a lot of practice.\u201d Because this new technique relies on magnetic fields to detect the presence of the parasitic waste, it may be more reliable as there is less scope for human error. Is it ready to be used in the field? Not yet. The technology is still in the early stages and will need to be tested and developed further for reliable field deployment. However, the results so far are promising. So promising in fact that researchers are launching a company to make this technology available at an affordable price. The team has also began running field tests in south-east Asia, and is exploring ways to power the device on solar energy, making it more accessible for healthcare workers in poor, rural areas.

Movingly, the New York artist Moyra Davey harks back to an age of handwritten letters, when melancholy confessions might be intensified by distance and delay. The late Ian Breakwell, a specialist in the potent eccentricities of private diaries, is also here, as is Joanna Piotrowska in an accompanying show capturing the age-old communications of emotional gesture. Northern Gallery For Contemporary Art, Fri to 10 Jan RC Vicken Parsons, nr Salisbury     Untitled, 2013, by Vicken Parsons Photograph: Other    At first glance, Vicken Parsons\u2019s paintings of bare interiors in drab hues seem to depict spaces barely worth considering. The outside world does not intrude on this painterly universe; windows, when they appear, open on to plain fields of brush-marked paint. But spend some time with them and you\u2019ll find your perspective shift: that line across the picture plane might delineate a vast horizon, while what first appears to be a cramped space becomes a cavernous hall. This show pairs her well-known works on wood board with recent forays into sculpture: steel blocks that become a three-dimensional base for her experiments with paint. She\u2019s also creating her largest painting to date, across the gallery\u2019s glass facade. New Art Centre, East Winterslow, Sun to 2 Nov SS The Influence Of Furniture On Love, Cambridge     Bottle, (2013), by The Grantchester Pottery Photograph: Other    The exhibition title is taken from an early 20th-century essay by the economist John Maynard Keynes, in which he ponders in what ways the design of our domestic environments \u201csuggest to us thoughts and feelings\u201d. Accordingly, this is far from an ordinary gallery show. For one thing it is staged at Wysing Arts Centre\u2019s 17th-century farmhouse, built reputedly from timbers salvaged from the sinking of the Spanish Armada. For another, the exhibition honours the venue\u2019s place as a sanctuary for artists. Artist-curator Giles Round has invited some past visitors back, including his decorative arts company The Grantchester Pottery, to install work in tribute to the venue and host public talks, performances and screenings. Wysing Arts Centre, Sun to 2 Nov RC Pierre Huyghe, Paul McCarthy, London     Paul McCarthy Photograph: Fredrik Nilsen    Be it the statue with a beehive for a head hidden in a park\u2019s sprawling, swampy compost heap at dOCUMENTA13, or the aquarium where hermit crabs set up home in a replica Brancusi head at 2011\u2019s Frieze art fair, Pierre Huyghe\u2019s work is always a must-see event. His gallery has kept the precise content of his first big London show since an acclaimed Tate Modern exhibition in 2006 under wraps until its opening today. The other half of the Savile Row gallery is given over to the master of scatological performance art and pop culture savagery, Paul McCarthy. He\u2019s returning to painting after a four-decade hiatus, with works inspired by the classic John Wayne western, Stagecoach. Hauser &amp; Wirth, W1, Sat to 1 Nov SS Wendy Ramshaw, Middlesbrough     Rooms of Dreams, by Wendy Ramshaw. Photograph: Other    For Wendy Ramshaw, a piece of jewellery is a catalyst for the imagination, a prop for sensuous reverie and role-playing. Her retrospective is installed like a modernist stage set, the gallery\u2019s white-cube ambience cut through with brick-red geometries. Her rings are displayed on mini towers that that look like something retrieved from the filtration inside of a hookah pipe. While more high-profile works such as her Hyde Park Gate commission might be compromised by the populist demands of public art, her jewellery is aesthetically sturdy enough to be termed wearable sculpture. MIMA, to 4 Dec RC Trisha Donnely, Cerith Wyn Evans, London     Cerith Wyn Evans Photograph: Todd-White Art Photography    Trisha Donnelly and Cerith Wyn Evans are an apt pairing for the Serpentine\u2019s autumn shows. Both favour a gossamer touch in conceptual art that\u2019s often mysterious to the point of opacity, but in a good way. The American Donnelly has a gift for quietly stoking awesomeness in lesser-considered corners, be that the huge hunk of carved pink marble she deposited in the shadowy interior of a lofty old stone building in a Venice garden, where it stood like a megalith for some secret cult, or the exhibition of exquisite bird photography she staged at MoMA in 2011. Meanwhile, in the Sackler gallery, Britain\u2019s Wynn Evans weaves complex allusions to creative thinkers and artistic revolutionaries from Proust to Bataille to Fassbinder in his sound and neon works. He plays directly with the question of interpretation in his chandeliers blinking out Morse code and a frieze of neon words.

For the duo\u2019s first show with Lisson they\u2019re moving on from the explicit fairytale antics to create a psychedelic environment with abstract animated projections, sculpture and music. Animations can be found not on screens, but hidden in urns or projected across tabletops, as if magically bringing the furniture to life. Birds and butterflies are placed amid flashing, hanging neon sculptures and animated drawings, which all move to Berg\u2019s disorienting sounds. Meanwhile, an accompanying show provides the chance to check rarely seen works from performance art figurehead Marina Abramovic\u2019s formative years, 1971 to 81.  Lisson Gallery, NW1, Tue to 1 Nov SS Qasim Riza Shaheen, Manchester &amp; Birmingham     Misplaced Memoirs by Qasim Riza Shaheen. Karin Albinsson Photograph: Karin Albinsson    In films, video performances, photographs and mixed-media drawings, Qasim Riza Shaheen presents his affecting reflections on love and loss, split between two gallery locations. Manchester-based Shaheen sets the scene with the title of his hometown show Autoportraits In Love-like Conditions. For him, self-portraiture is more a matter of imaginative self-creation than any pretence of authentic self-definition. Filmed in Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and the UK, his enactments of queer romance, straight social alienation, and the universal melodramas of unrequited desire are choreographed with painful sensitivity.

Yang Guang is asleep off-camera and Tian Tian, his possibly pregnant mate, is in a separate enclosure. Meanwhile, Iain Valentine, the zoo&apos;s director of pandas, paces around the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland&apos;s office like an expectant father. If Tian Tian gives birth, it will be in the next few days. If she were to, the zoo&apos;s financial security would be assured \u2013 even as Scotland decides its political future. A panda cub would be a conservation superstar, attracting millions of visitors at up to \u00a316 a head. But if Tian Tian isn&apos;t even pregnant, the zoo faces declining public interest, rising costs and possible financial ruin. The next few hours are crucial, said Valentine. &quot;We cannot be certain how long it will be before we call it a day with Tian Tian. We are coming to the end. Shortly she will hit what we call base with her progesterone levels and only at that point will we be certain \u2013 she will simply either give birth or not.&quot; Parents or not, Tian Tian and Yang Guang are the animal equivalents of Premier League footballers; they cost a fortune to buy and maintain, but are guaranteed to draw crowds. But academic research into &quot;pandanomics&quot; also suggests that they and other captive giant pandas have become strategic assets deployed by China for geopolitical advantage. According to Valentine, the Edinburgh pair have more than paid their way since they arrived in 2011. &quot;Zoo numbers have increased by four million people in two years,&quot; he said. However, the costs are rising and experience from other zoos suggests that the numbers will tail off if no cub is born. The pandas are rented from the Chinese government for 10 years and the contract stipulates that Edinburgh must pay \u00a3600,000 a year for the pair. Any cub that is born must be returned to China after two years. Should one die because of human error, it is understood that the zoo must pay \u00a3300,000. But that is just the start. The zoo had to spend nearly \u00a3300,000 to house its pandas and has now been hit by rising bamboo costs. When the pair arrived in 2011, it cost around \u00a370,000 a year to import fresh shoots from France, but this has risen to \u00a3100,000, said Valentine. To offset the costs, the zoo has now planted 3,000 clumps. Having a panda can be ruinous, say some zoos, and could even take money away from other conservation work. Washington, Atlanta, Memphis and San Diego zoos are said to have spent $33m more on pandas from 2000-03 than they received from showing them. During the cold war, Mao gave pandas away as a sign of diplomatic friendship. But World Resources Institute researcher Kathleen Buckingham, with a team at Oxford University, last year studied China&apos;s recent panda loans and concluded that all were linked to trade. The Edinburgh deal, overseen by China&apos;s vice-premier, Li Keqiang, coincided with a \u00a32.6bn contract for Britain to supply China with petrochemical and renewable energy technologies, Jaguar cars and enough salmon to double Scotland&apos;s production. Other panda pairs were loaned to Canadian and Australian zoos after negotiations for uranium, oil and minerals. Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Macao all got pandas after signing free-trade agreements In France, the panda loan to Beauval zoo coincided with a $20bn deal for nuclear giant Areva to supply China with uranium oxide. &quot;A new phase of panda diplomacy is under way. Panda loans are associated with nations supplying China with valuable resources and symbolise China&apos;s willingness to build trade relationships,&quot; said Buckingham. She likens the loans to Asian rulers&apos; traditional gifts to foreign powers of rare white elephants in the knowledge that they would cost a fortune to keep but ensure closer relations. &quot;The panda may be the modern-day white elephant \u2013 a powerful emblem of the modern Chinese nation,&quot; she said. By next year, 20 zoos outside China are expected to have pandas. The growing numbers sent abroad are thought to be linked to the 2008 magnitude eight Sichuan earthquake, which destroyed much of the animals&apos; habitat. China was left with a surplus of captive pandas, but nowhere for them to go. Some conservationists argue that with only 1,600 animals left in the wild, foreign zoos are helping to breed a diverse population fit to be released. But critics say only 90 cubs have been born outside China in 35 years. Links between foreign zoos and Chinese researchers have led to advances in captive breeding, said Valentine. &quot;There are now 340 giant pandas in captivity. China is playing the long game. Until now it has been trying to build up the captive population to between 300 and 500. That&apos;s the magic number for genetic integrity. &quot;They have got that now, so the task is to make sure they can survive in the wild. In the next few years we can expect tens of pandas to be introduced into the wild,&quot; he said. However, only 10 have been released since 1983, with just two of them still alive.Six were recaptured after suffering significant weight loss, one was probably killed by wild pandas, and another is believed to have died, said Buckingham.     A panda at Yunnan Safari Park, Kunming, is offered moon cakes ahead of the Mid-Autumn festival: few animals released back into the wild have survived. Photograph: Rex    American academic Sarah Bexell, who works at the Chengdu research base in Sichuan, where more than 100 giant pandas have been born, said: &quot;The future is immensely grim for them. &quot;We tried hard and invested huge amounts of money and time and intellectual inputs in captive breeding, on good faith that humans would save space for others. We failed.&quot; She blames population growth and consumerism for what she fears may be eventual extinction. &quot;The Chinese institutions have done a great job, but people don&apos;t want to live in poverty and there is no room for people and pandas. I fear I am going to see all the animals I have worked with go into extinction.&quot; Kati Loeffler, a vet and former director of animal health at Chengdu who is now with the International Fund for Animal Welfare in Massachusetts, said China was not interested in conservation. &quot;Conservation there is a joke. It&apos;s all about politics and money. If the west was not interested in pandas, the Chinese would start eating them. &quot;It is sickening how the captive animals are treated to make reproductive rabbits out of them. They are raised in a human-dominated environment. Individuals are not normal pandas, nor will they ever be, and the reserves where they live in the wild are not protected. It&apos;s just a big entertainment show.&quot; But back in Edinburgh, Valentine is still hoping that a cub will be born. &quot;I have not given up yet,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/14/foreign-tech-entrepreneurs-visa-us-struggle", "sentences": ["\u201cThe prosperity is not going to remain here, jobs are going to go somewhere else.\u201d Countries like Chile, Singapore and Canada are currently creating startup hubs to attract foreign entrepreneurs."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-14T15:30:11Z", "title": "For foreign tech entrepreneurs, getting a visa to work in the US is a struggle", "tags": ["Business", "Small business", "Technology", "World news"], "article": "\u201cDo you want to have the next Google in the US?

Berenguer, now at work on his second startup, believes talented entrepreneurs will eventually move elsewhere if the current US visa system is not overhauled. Many others agree; the idea was the linchpin of entrepreneur Vivek Wadhwa\u2019s book, The Immigrant Exodus. \u201cIf the US continues to do what it\u2019s doing, five, 10 years from now, it\u2019s not going to be the leader any more,\u201d says Seattle-based immigration lawyer Tahmina Watson, who has many foreign-born tech clients.  \u201cIs that what the US wants?\u201d asks Watson. \u201cThe prosperity is not going to remain here, jobs are going to go somewhere else.\u201d Countries like Chile, Singapore and Canada are currently creating startup hubs to attract foreign entrepreneurs.

Affable yet intense, Berenguer sports a pair of perfectly fitting worn jeans and a blue Oxford shirt in his downtown New York office. The office is now home to the second company he co-founded and which recently launched the caller ID app Klink. By most measures, he would already be considered a success. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, with a stint at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship, Berenguer co-created the photo aggregations app Pixable, along with Andr\u00e9s Blank and Alberto Sheinfeld, both originally from Venezuela. In 2009 all three moved to New York City from Massachusetts, where Berenguer and Blank earned MBAs from MIT. Pixable uses a combination of meta-data, algorithms and editors to curate photos for its users. Within three years of its creation Pixable was bought by SingTel in 2012 for $26.5m; Berenguer remains the CEO.  His current office, in downtown Manhattan\u2019s hip SoHo neighbourhood, is the picture of the typical US startup.

One of the \u201cteam values\u201d stated on a poster is \u201cdelight our customers\u201d.  Berenguer has an informal job as something of a visa whisperer to his fellow foreign-born entrepreneurs. When immigrant entrepreneurs converge, professionally or socially, conversations quickly turn to visas.  Late last year, he shared a stage with two co-founders of New York tech startups \u2013 Jos\u00e9 de Cabo and Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez \u2013 to a rapt audience in Lower Manhattan. Eager foreign-born entrepreneurs who packed the space wanted to know how they managed to start US-based businesses as foreigners.  Berenguer and his fellow panellists rattled off their education, work histories, startup functions, and even amusing culture clash anecdotes like the time Fern\u00e1ndez was making a presentation to a room full of Americans and joked, \u201cI\u2019m from Spain, so I\u2019m not very ambitious,\u201d which, he reported with disappointment, did not elicit one laugh.  But what this audience desperately wanted was guidance regarding the labyrinthine legal path a foreigner must follow to obtain the proper visa allowing them to start a business in the US. There were no magical solutions revealed other than \u201chire a good lawyer\u201d.  \u201cGetting them is difficult,\u201d explains Berenguer of the work visas, \u201cand once you have them, they expire.\u201d  Those with enviable visas are asked, \u201cHow did you do that?\u201d and then tell a complicated tale that usually includes a patchwork of applications and forms \u2013 sometimes with creative wording, innovative lawyers, fees paid, numerous waiting periods, additional paperwork, and possibly trips home.  \u201cBasically every case is kind of different,\u201d says Berenguer who had a tenuous visa situation until recently when a green card was granted because of that special qualification, his \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d.  It\u2019s an inadequate answer, which Berenguer himself has lived through. In a Spanish accent, complete with rolling r\u2019s, he unabashedly praises the US startup culture and corporate landscape, using the word \u201cmeritocracy\u201d often. He adds earnestly that he\u2019s living the American Dream. But enthusiasm wanes when Berenguer addresses the US\u2019s visa system for entrepreneurs. Like many in his position, he has found it murky, subjective and frustrating. The orderly tech expert in him seems to find the disorganisation baffling. \u201cThere is not a single website that tells you \u2013 with very simple, five bullet points \u2013 whether you qualify or not, or what are your options,\u201d says Berenguer.  Part of the problem is that the framework for employment-based immigration stems from 1990, according to New York City immigration lawyer Chris Gafner.  Populations, quotas, technology and global immigration options have changed drastically since then. An innovative solution introduced to help immigrant entrepreneurs is what\u2019s known as the startup visa, which is now languishing in Congress. Gafner explains the startup visa would fill a current visa void for those foreigners, often graduates of US universities, who want to remain in the country and start businesses.      Berenguer was educated at Cambridge, where his intellectual idols had taught and studied Photograph: oversnap/Getty Images    Berenguer did not set out to be a businessman at all. He assumed he would have a quiet, secure life in academia. He never thought he would be dealing with investors, visas and running a company. He grew up in Muro de Alcoi, a village near Valencia, during the early post-Franco years. His father never attended high school, which Berenguer calls \u201ctypical\u201d of middle class, smalltown 1950s Spain. Berenguer spent his teenage years consuming biographies about science\u2019s greats: Darwin, Stephen Hawking and Isaac Newton, among others, who all had affiliations with the University of Cambridge in the UK. Berenguer headed to their alma mater to earn his master\u2019s and PhD in engineering after his undergraduate years in Spain.   The entrepreneurial spirit was awoken at Cambridge when Berenguer was exposed to serial entrepreneurs like Andy Hopper, and concepts like commercialising the solution to a problem troubling multiple people.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know about venture capital and all that until I was there,\u201d recalls Berenguer. He was a goner: entrepreneurship sounded far more risky, challenging, and exciting than academia.  After moving to New York City in 2009 and raising $400,000 through family and friends, the Pixable team, now five, worked out of Berenguer\u2019s cramped Manhattan apartment, sometimes working 80-hour weeks.  Perhaps no one was more delighted than Berenguer\u2019s beleaguered roommate when the Pixable founders were accepted into the Varick Street Incubator, a tech startup incubator run by the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.  \u201cWe warmly welcome immigrant entrepreneurs,\u201d says Micah Kotch, the incubator\u2019s recently departed director of innovation and entrepreneurship.  Allotting resources to an immigrant startup versus a native-born US startup is a complete non-issue according to Kotch.  \u201cAs long as they were willing to base the company in New York and create jobs in New York,\u201d says Kotch, \u201cthey could have come from Antarctica, or India, or Texas.\u201d  He adds: \u201cNo country has a monopoly on good ideas. And I think particularly in New York City, it\u2019s in our DNA to be a home for immigrants.\u201d  The venture capital firm Highland Capital Partners took an interest in Pixable and invested $7m (\u00a34.3m). After SingTel bought Pixable, Berenguer beams that the investors multiplied their money.  Berenguer is equally proud that every Pixable team-member made money from the acquisition through stock options, an aspect of US startup culture Berenguer appreciates. In Spain, typically only a company founder makes money through an acquisition.     The NYU School of Engineering Varick Street Incubator that accepted the Pixable team Photograph: Berenguer    There is another reason foreign-born tech entrepreneurs have trouble making their case. Perhaps it is a case of sour grapes or legitimate concerns about income inequality, but critics of the current tech startup scene consider the companies overvalued and producing empty first-world entertainment products \u2013 immigrant-owned or otherwise.  But successful tech companies do innovate, create jobs and pay taxes; employees rent apartments and eat in restaurants creating a local economy.  Not that Berenguer is doing much partying. His leisure activities, beyond marathon-running, are skimpy on glamour.  \u201cI read blogs about technology, magazines about technology,\u201d says Berenguer, adding that he also likes to watch videos of technology conferences and presentations.  He does socialise \u2013 with other tech entrepreneurs.   \u201cIt\u2019s a very blended, blurry line between work and pleasure,\u201d concedes Berenguer. He likes to spend time with his wife, who is not in the tech world, \u201cbut I share all the stories with her,\u201d laughs Berenguer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/15/stylish-hostel-winter-autumn-sun-holidays", "sentences": ["Matchbox, Singapore          Matchbox, in an old shophouse in the Chinatown area, has three spotless, primary-coloured dorms and an \u201centertainment loft\u201d for board games and film nights."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-15T07:32:50Z", "title": "10 of the best stylish hostels for autumn and winter sun ", "tags": ["Hostels", "Winter sun", "Backpacking holidays", "Budget travel", "Travel", "Hotels"], "article": "Jack Sprat Shack, Treasure Bay, Jamaica On an island better known for all-inclusive resorts than cool independent hotels, the Jack Sprat Shack, opening in late October, is a departure from the Caribbean norm.

As a social entrepreneur, CEO and management consultant, Jim has worked on a variety of economic development issues in emerging markets. Through Hybrid Social Solutions (HSSi), Jim and his team are working to reach off-the-grid communities in the Philippines with solar electricity and provide the required support to ensure that they can benefit from these products for many years. This interview took place at the BoP World Convention and Expo in Singapore. What has HSSi recently achieved? Earlier this year, HSSi and its partners surpassed a threshold of impact, with over 100,000 villagers now benefiting from our solar energy products. At the same time, we have attained healthy profitability, which has given us the confidence to scale up our business models. Every year, we have gone deeper within our communities to sell a wider variety of products, launching HSSi distribution partnerships in new villages. In the Philippines, where over 20% of the population has no access to energy, and many more suffer from poor energy quality and black outs, we see significant opportunities, and we are currently raising funds to drive further growth. We have been doing impact assessments along the way, so I can say with some confidence that our growth also drives positive social impact. For instance, we know that the children who check out lights through our solar library programme for schools without electricity study 45% more at night than they did previously.  We have also documented that families using solar rather than kerosene for lighting cough less, feel more confident, and save money over time. On average, users save US$10 (\u00a36.15) per month by reducing their use of kerosene, and they earn an additional US$30 (\u00a318.45) per month through productivity gains. So we are seeing our customers earn an additional US$40 (\u00a324.60) per month by using our products, which is a significant boost for households that earn only US$150 (\u00a392.30) per month. Why is solar a good solution to this problem in the Philippines? What is unique about HSSi\u2019s approach that ensures the success of solar energy, whereas in other countries it has not yet gained traction? The reason solar energy must be subsidised in developed countries is because the alternative is cheap electricity from the grid. Without factoring in externalities, solar is more expensive than coal or nuclear in these countries, so subsidies are required to incentivise use. The Philippines is a unique market for electricity. With over 2,000 inhabited islands, it has been extremely difficult to extend an electrical grid to communities in remote areas. For my customers, the alternative to solar is kerosene or batteries. To run a radio, a poor person pays 4,000 times more for energy from batteries than a person with access to the electrical grid. That is a real penalty for people in poverty, so solar makes sense in this context. Even those who have electricity in the Philippines are poorly connected. Many communities, particularly in outlying areas, suffer daily outages due to power shortages. And with more than a dozen typhoons knocking down power lines every year, millions suffer power outages on a regular basis, many lasting weeks at a time. The nice thing about solar is that you have your own independent electrical system, and the energy is free. The capital expenditure for a solar system can be repaid over time, which makes it affordable. We are beginning to see interest in our home solar systems, even from people who are already on the electrical grid. You coordinate several different organisations to deliver solar electrical products to rural poor people. Can you tell us a bit about how these organisations interact? We are building an ecosystem to support standalone solar energy devices, which we believe is essential to ensure the sustainability and future growth of the initiative. HSSi specialises in distribution: we are the master distributor that builds the network through which solar products are delivered to poor communities across the Philippines. We source most of our products from Sun Transfer, a German company that builds and sources our lamps, home systems, and specialised installations. For supplier financing, we partner with a German cooperative bank. Our network includes the Solar Energy Foundation, a separate entity that raises funds for community organisations that cannot afford our products, but would greatly benefit from them \u2013 such as schools, clinics and birthing centres. It is part of the Stiftung Solarenergie International Network of Rural Development. HSSi\u2019s team of hybrid area managers and our community distribution partners are key to our success. We put a lot of effort into identifying local partners in each community that we enter. We most often work through member organisations like cooperatives, NGOs and microfinance organisations. We also recruit entrepreneurs to sell our products directly, but this is less common. The hard work by our team is in building the capacity of our distributors so they can sell the solar products in their communities and benefit financially from the effort. When we enter a new community, we conduct a four-to-six month training programme with the local distributor, which covers product marketing, integrating sales into their systems, managing inventories, dealing with warranty claims, etc. We help them to select the product line that will be most attractive to community members, and to establish consumer financing options. We also show them how to train consumers in the correct use of the products to ensure that they do not accidentally break them. We basically train our partners in all the basics of sales, marketing, inventory management, and maintenance. It takes a lot of time, but it is essential to our success. Only when the distribution system is working in the first branch do we replicate across other branches with our distribution partners. What would you say are the most important factors in the success of your work? First and foremost: for this to work, all the players across the value chain must see the value. Everyone from the product innovator, social distributor, maintenance partner, community partner and end-customer need to see financial benefits. Our job is to connect the pieces and ensure value. Also, the product line must be robust and tailored to the needs of consumers. For instance, we sell a home lighting system that particularly appeals to fishermen. When they fish at night, they use the light to attract fish to their boats instead of traditional kerosene lamps. By reducing the amount of kerosene they use, the pay-back period for the solar light system is only a month and a half. Since they are used outdoors, Sun Transfer\u2019s products are water proof and shock proof, and they come with a two-year warranty that offers free repairs or replacements. The typical loan that customers obtain to purchase a product lasts from three months to one year, so the length of the warranty gives them confidence that they will benefit from the product for an extended period of time. For us, the cost of a broken product is very high \u2013 it is not just the cost of fixing or replacing the product, rather it\u2019s the impact it has on our customer. For example, we had proudly fixed a customer\u2019s light within one week, our target for repair turnaround. While appreciative, she reminded us that because she relied on the lamp for her livelihood, she was unable to feed her children for three days while the light was being fixed. Poorly made solar lights cause damage to a reputation that is not easily undone. Also, because many of our customers take loans from our distributors to afford their product, it is imperative that the product works throughout the life of the loan. If customers stop paying their loans, our partners have problems and soon lose interest in our solar program. Therefore, we ensure that our products are as robust as possible, train our customers in their proper use, and set up maintenance procedures. Finally, we are where we are because of the commitment of our team members to ensuring that our customers and partners are able to get access to our products and enjoy their benefits over time. Our culture marries the compassion of Mother Teresa with the teamwork and performance of the Marines, and this combination has enabled us to earn the trust of our partners and customers. What do you envision as HSSi\u2019s next avenues for growth? Solar lanterns are just the beginning. With a strong distribution system in place, we can offer increasingly high-end products to remote communities. Eventually, we want to be able to offer more aspirational products: solar systems large enough to run electrical fans, televisions, refrigerators, water pumps and to charge computers and tablets. However, these products need a stronger technical team, more customisation, and new financing schemes. We are now in the process of expanding the branches where HSSi technicians can be deployed to homes for equipment installation and regular maintenance visits. This is where we are headed. Thank you for sharing your story with us. We wish you the best of luck as HSSi continues to grow!

Since then, activists from Ethiopia and Bahrain, amongst other nations, claimed to have been targeted by governments using FinFisher. WikiLeaks said Germany should take action to stop the malware spreading. \u201cFinFisher continues to operate brazenly from Germany selling weaponised surveillance malware to some of the most abusive regimes in the world. The Merkel government pretends to be concerned about privacy, but its actions speak otherwise,\u201d said Julian Assange, WikiLeaks\u2019 editor in chief.  \u201cWhy does the Merkel government continue to protect FinFisher? This full data release will help the technical community build tools to protect people from FinFisher including by tracking down its command and control centres.\u201d Assange\u2019s organisation claimed FinFisher\u2019s revenue from the sales documented in the leak amounted to around \u20ac50m (\u00a340m), though Bill Marczak, a researcher from Citizen Lab, suggested this could have been over-estimated. FinFisher and its previous owner Gamma have previously claimed they only sold their products to responsible governments, though researchers and activists believe the firm has lied about its customer list. It had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Claudio Guarnieri, an independent researcher who has been investigating FinFisher on behalf of Citizen Lab, told the Guardian the release should have a positive effect. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good release. Firstly because now it collects the material from the breach and make some sense out of the data, when nobody really made the effort to do some decent work around it.\u201d Eric King, deputy director at Privacy International, also praised the release. \u201cThese new documents from Wikileaks give us greater insight into how companies like FinFisher and the governments they supply compromise our personal devices, and spy on the most private parts of our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cMore transparency is needed to hold companies like FinFisher to account, as well as the governments purchasing such equipment. Without public scrutiny of the surveillance technology industry, activists will continue to be targeted by repressive regimes and the damaging practices of FinFisher will be allowed to continue unabated.\u201d The wider fight against so-called \u201clawful interception\u201d technologies continues. In the UK, Privacy International has been leading the charge, recently uncovering data implicating Swiss surveillance tech company Neosoft in \u201ctrying to equip and train a brutal government unit in Bangladesh\u201d. \u2022 The digital arms race, and what is being done to fight it"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2014/sep/16/kuala-lumpur-a-city-in-traffic-gridlock-striving-for-sustainability", "sentences": ["It\u2019s looking at how other cities have tackled the issue, says Ngah, including Singapore, Melbourne and London, and is considering introducing a congestion charge, as well as dedicated cycle lanes."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-16T12:49:56Z", "title": "Kuala Lumpur: a city in traffic gridlock, striving for sustainability", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Society Professionals", "Transport", "Cities", "Asia Pacific", "Malaysia"], "article": "In a city of 1.7 million people, crammed into an area of just 94 square kilometres, the challenge for Kuala Lumpar is how to grow economically and physically without creating an urban dystopia. The city\u2019s population is set to grow to 2.2 million by 2020 and to triple to 4.8 million by 2050.  \u201cCities like Kuala Lumpur are places of opportunity and act as a magnet, attracting people, but of course there are problems when a city\u2019s capacity can\u2019t meet demand,\u201d Mahadi Ngah, deputy mayor of Kuala Lumpur, explains. \u201cThe challenge is how to format urban planning policies.\u201d In Malaysia\u2019s capital, creating a sustainable environment isn\u2019t just about balancing the needs of people for housing, transport, education, health and leisure. Ethnic diversity is a very real issue in the country, where a colonial past has resulted in a mixed population. People from a Malay background make up half the population, while almost a quarter are of Chinese heritage. There is also a substantial number of people from Indian descent.  \u201cTo live in harmony, we have to address the issue of diversity and manage the increasing complexities the city has to face,\u201d says Ngah.  As in all major cities, the immediate problem for Ngah and his colleagues is how to develop better transport without strangling the city. At the moment, public transport accounts for a mere 20% of journeys in Kuala Lumpur and the city is criss-crossed with major roads that get congested, particularly on weekdays. Every day, says Ngah another 1,000 new vehicles are registered in the city. The city\u2019s politicians want to change this. It\u2019s not that the city hasn\u2019t tried to tackle these issues. Back in the 1970s, the city put together a comprehensive urban plan, which was updated in 1984. Together with a specific planning law for the city, this enables the mayor to regulate development in a way that has worked well, according to Ngah. \u201cWe are quite blessed because of the flexibility of the law. A rigid plan would have created more conflicts,\u201d he says.  The results for both the city and Malaysia as a country, particularly since the election of prime minister Najib Razak, can be seen from the World Bank\u2019s listing of the countries that are friendliest to business. Malaysia has vaulted from 12th to sixth in the list. But with huge existing housing density and urban sprawl, Kuala Lumpur is going to need some tough measures to move its citizens out of their cars and onto public transport. It\u2019s looking at how other cities have tackled the issue, says Ngah, including Singapore, Melbourne and London, and is considering introducing a congestion charge, as well as dedicated cycle lanes. It also wants to restrict parking available in new housing developments.  The ultimate prize is a sustainable city that people want to live in. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be aggressive in imposing restrictions, but when our projects are in place, such as a new inner ring road and expanding the metropolitan rail system, then the government will impose more restrictive measures,\u201d says Ngah. \u201cWe want to compel people to use public transport.\u201d Let us know what you think via public.leaders@theguardian.com  Interested in public services?

Whisky is Scotland&apos;s second-largest export behind oil and gas and is worth \u00a34.3bn a year to the local economy, but sales could be hit if the country loses access to the EU&apos;s free trade area and to markets in the rest of the world where Brussels has forged trade deals. The Scottish National party has argued that independence would boost food and drink manufacturers by giving them tailor-made support to sell abroad, while they would also benefit from the pound and uninterrupted EU membership. But Rabobank estimates a newly independent Scotland could be shut out of the EU for at least two years after a formal split from the rest of the UK in March 2016. &quot;As a result, Scotch could face increased competition from other spirits and might lose competitiveness in key EU markets&quot; \u2013 which comprise more than a third of its annual sales. A new Scottish government would face &quot;a mountainous task&quot; in striking trade deals beyond Europe. Scotch is exported to about 200 countries, with major markets in the US, Singapore and South Africa, while Chinese consumers are also getting a taste for it. The bank suggests higher interest rates caused by uncertainty over the currency would raise costs for the industry, with the burden more likely to be borne by small distillers rather than large international conglomerates such as Pernod Ricard and Diageo. &quot;The short-term benefits of a yes vote are small, while the downside risks are significant,&quot; analyst Elena Saputo wrote in a note, which also raises the prospect of higher barley costs after the loss of EU farm subsidies. The Scotch Whisky Association has previously voiced concerns about independence, highlighting the damage to exports that would come from a temporary suspension of EU membership, as well as the loss of access to UK embassies which have been used to promote the industry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/sep/18/alibaba-and-the-40-facts-ipo", "sentences": ["A team from Alibaba visited New York, Boston, Hong Kong and Singapore to drum up investor support."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-18T11:31:25Z", "title": "Alibaba and the 40 facts", "tags": ["Alibaba", "Business", "E-commerce", "Internet", "Technology", "China", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "When Alibaba makes its debut on the New York stock market on Friday, it will be the world&apos;s biggest initial public offering (IPO). Here are 40 facts you didn&apos;t know: 1. Jack Ma was an English teacher when he started the site from his one-bedroom apartment in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, in 1998. 2. In its early days, staff would pretend they were not Chinese when sending emails to American customers. 3. It dominates internet retailing in China, where it powers 80% of online commerce. 4. Alibaba is not Ma&apos;s first e-commerce venture \u2013 he founded China Yellowpages, said to be the first internet company in China. 5. He set up Alibaba with $60,000 borrowed from 18 people. 6. Ma first came across the internet in 1995 during a trip to Seattle. His first search? &quot;Beer&quot;. 7. Alibaba&apos;s sales for 2014 are estimated at $420bn (\u00a3257bn), dwarfing Amazon and eBay which had a combined turnover of $90bn in 2013. 8. It has 300m customers - just short of the entire US population. 9. On a single promotional day in November 2013, Alibaba recorded sales of $5.6bn. 10. Ma is currently estimated to be China&apos;s third richest person, with a $10.3bn fortune. The float should catapult him into first place. 11. His shareholding in Alibaba is 8.9%. 12. Ma came up with the name Alibaba in a coffee shop in San Francisco. He pulled his waitress over to ask what she knew about Ali Baba and she replied: &quot;Open Sesame.&quot; He says the name reflects how his business opens up opportunities for small businesses to sell their goods.     Jack Ma: founder and chairman of Alibaba. Photograph: AP    13. Critics say fake goods appear rife on many Alibaba sites, although the company claims to spend millions rooting them out. 14. It is expected that at least $22bn of shares will be sold on Thursday, in what is expected to be the world&apos;s largest IPO. 15 If underwriters exercise an option to sell more shares, Alibaba&apos;s market debut will top Agricultural Bank of China Ltd&apos;s record $22.1bn listing in 2010. 16. The company will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. 17. Its shares will trade under the ticker &quot;BABA&quot;. 18. New York was chosen for Alibaba&apos;s debut after the Hong Kong stock exchange&apos;s officials rejected its request to allow a small group of company insiders to nominate the majority of the board. 19. Ma is well known for his flamboyance and has entertained staff singing The Lion King (view the video here, from 1.04). 20. When he needs inspiration, Ma returns to the flat where he started the company. 21. In a letter sent to staff the day that Alibaba filed its IPO prospectus, he said: &quot;We will continue to adhere to the principle of &apos;customers first, employees second, shareholders third&apos;.&quot; 22. The company employs more than 25,000 people. 23. The biggest shopping site under the Alibaba umbrella is Taobao, where 7m merchants sell their wares. 24. After the IPO, power at the e-commerce giant will be concentrated in the hands of a 28-person partnership. 25. The power structure has led to criticism that if an investor were unhappy about the direction of the company, they would have little ability to change it. 26. New York was chosen for the listing in part due to its more relaxed attitude to voting, which will let Ma retain his grip on the company. 27. The corporate structure will allow Ma and other senior staff to nominate more than half of the board members. 28. It is thought Alibaba will target US and European markets after it lists despite low recognition of the brand. 29 A recent US poll found that 88% of respondents had not heard of Alibaba. 30. Ma has always been confident of dominating China and fending off eBay: &quot;eBay may be a shark in the ocean, but I am a crocodile in the Yangtze river. If we fight in the ocean, we lose \u2013 but if we fight in the river, we win.&quot; 31. Ma is said to be influenced by martial arts and kung fu movies and their principles of upholding righteousness. 32. More than 50% of parcels sent in China are Alibaba parcels. 33. Ma&apos;s talent for public-speaking and showmanship hailed from his parents, both past performers in the traditional storytelling art of ping tan.     Open seasme: a still from Ali Baba Goes To Town, 1937. Jack Ma played on the asociations with the fictional character's treasure trove for his business. Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Everett/Rex    34. Much of the interest in Alibaba hails from investors eager to exploit China&apos;s booming economy. 35. A team from Alibaba visited New York, Boston, Hong Kong and Singapore to drum up investor support. 36. Alibaba&apos;s success is built on the huge number of internet users in China, estimated at 600 million. 37. A new frontier for Alibaba is financial services \u2013 with its Alipay app which can be used to make payments \u2013 from paying taxis or investing in funds. 38. Strong demand for shares raised the price range earlier this week to between $66 and $68 a share, up from the initial $60 to $66. 39. At $68 a share, Alibaba would be valued at around $162.7bn which would make it the biggest float in history. This would make it larger than Amazon, which is valued at around $150bn. 40. Despite his success, Ma once claimed that he has little knowledge about technology, limiting his computer use to surfing the web and emailing."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/18/bernie-ecclestone-f1-radio-ban-formula-one", "sentences": ["Asked before Sunday\u2019s Singapore Grand Prix if he was in support of the radio ban, Ecclestone replied: \u201cAs I was the one who started it off \u2013 yes.", "He replied: \u201cIt is not easy, but it was easier than it was.\u201d The FIA is holding a meeting with teams in Singapore on Thursday to clarify the radio ban rule."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-18T16:20:27Z", "title": "Bernie Ecclestone backs F1 ban on teams instructing drivers via radio", "tags": ["Formula One 2014", "Formula One", "Bernie Ecclestone", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Bernie Ecclestone has spoken out in support of Formula One\u2019s recently announced ban on teams giving their drivers advice via radios \u2013 and claimed it was his idea all along. The sport\u2019s chief executive has also given a strong hint that there are more changes on the way. The FIA, the sport\u2019s governing body, announced recently that it was ready to enforce the rule that the drivers should \u201cdrive the car alone and unaided\u201d. The ruling follows criticism that the drivers are little more than puppets, and merely follow instructions from the pit wall. Asked before Sunday\u2019s Singapore Grand Prix if he was in support of the radio ban, Ecclestone replied: \u201cAs I was the one who started it off \u2013 yes. I think none of the drivers want it [radio]. They are all happy that it has gone. They drive the cars, they should know what is wrong or right, they don\u2019t need someone on the pit wall telling them what to do.\u201d Some drivers have spoken out in favour of the new initiative, but not all are in favour. Fernando Alonso said: \u201cI think this rule has no benefit. It is like basketball or football not allowing the coach to say anything. At the end of the day it is just a very competitive sport. Some of the messages we receive are for safety; it is not only for performance. \u201cIn our team, the instructions from the radio are very limited and we will not change our preparations for the race.\u201d The Mercedes motorsport executive director, Toto Wolff, has also described the ban as unclear. He said last week: \u201cThere will inevitably be some controversy so it will need further clarification as to how much essential on-track procedures will be affected.\u201d Ecclestone is clearly determined, however, to make life more difficult for drivers and teams, hinting he would also like to see a banning of live telemetry from the cars. \u201cWe have a regulation in force that drivers must drive the car unaided. They have been aided \u2013 and still are,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if we get rid of this ship to shore, as I call it, there are still a lot of aids that they should not have.\u201d Ecclestone, who was speaking at the announcement of a new sponsorship deal with Johnnie Walker, was also asked whether life had become too easy for the modern driver.

Indeed Ecclestone, F1\u2019s chief executive, fuelled the speculation himself when, prior to going to the paddocks, he said a decision regarding a 24-car grid was likely to be made by the middle of next month. \u201cWe\u2019ll know after the next two or three races,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been on the cards that if we lose up to three teams then the other teams will run three cars. \u201cI think we should do it anyway. I would rather see Ferrari with three cars, or any of the other top teams with three cars than having teams that are struggling.\u201d Asked whether the new arrangement was in the pipeline he replied: \u201cOh yeah, for sure.\u201d The two smallest teams in the paddock, Marussia and Caterham, are already fighting for survival. And two other teams, Sauber and Lotus, are also struggling to stay within a flawed business model, with no agreement to cap costs, funds unevenly distributed and the majority shareholders \u2013 the private equity firm CVC \u2013 making a profit. The truth is that all teams are finding life in F1 more difficult than they once did, and that includes even the big four of Mercedes, Ferrari, Red Bull and McLaren. When asked whether anything could be done to help struggling teams, Ecclestone replied: \u201cI\u2019ve been around \u2013 most people say too long \u2013 but long enough to know there are always people at the back of the grid.\u201d When Jenson Button, the 2009 world champion, was asked on Thursday about the possibility of teams running three teams he said: \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of work for the teams. If one car is so strong next year, you could have no other cars on the podium, which isn\u2019t so good. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had smaller teams. It\u2019s a good thing we have them, there\u2019s a lot of personalities. Obviously it would be nice if they didn\u2019t have such big struggles and they could be more competitive. But that\u2019s always been the case in Formula One.\u201d Speaking at the launch of a new sponsorship deal with the whisky manufacturers Johnnie Walker \u2013 Ecclestone also announced that the controversial double points initiative, which will be used for the final race in Abu Dhabi in November, was likely to be dropped for next year. He also suggested that the complex task of driving in F1 was going to get even harder following the recent ban of drivers receiving advice over the radio from their teams. He said: \u201cI think we might make their life more difficult. There is now likely to be further changes regarding telemetry.\u201d But Felipe Massa has added his voice to those concerned about the ban, claiming it could lead to a \u201cbig accident\u201d. The Williams driver: \u201cFor me it\u2019s a little bit funny that they change this type of thing in the moment. It\u2019s not the correct moment. Maybe they changed it because they spoke to the old drivers too much. \u201cIn some areas I think it\u2019s fine. If the team tells you not to use the tyres so much in corner five because you\u2019re using them too much compared to your team-mate, it\u2019s OK not to say that. This is not a problem. But you have so many things that we do in the car, that if you don\u2019t do maybe you put too much temperature in the rear brakes because the temperature gets too high, and then you just have a fire in the car. Maybe you could have a big accident.\u201d Massa added: \u201cWe saw situations like when Lewis [Hamilton] had fire in his car \u2013 you could have that many times if you\u2019re not using the right settings.\u201d Hamilton himself appeared in favour of the move. He said: \u201cI am excited about the new challenge. It\u2019s like going back to my karting days. \u201cThings like the formation lap; we are going to have to remember a lot of things without being told \u2013 that\u2019s a real challenge. It means there are more balls in the air we have to catch and we are already catching quite a lot.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/19/lewis-hamilton-singapore-grand-prix-practice", "sentences": ["But that might not mean too much when it comes to Sunday\u2019s Singapore Grand Prix because Rosberg had to abort his flying lap on super softs because of a crash by Lotus\u2019s Pastor Maldonado."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-19T15:44:20Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton heads second practice for Singapore Grand Prix", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Formula One 2014", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton topped the second practice run at the Marina Bay Street Circuit on Friday, as his arch rival and team-mate Nico Rosberg finished down in 13th place.

This could be the most confusing radio story since Guglielmo Marconi bewildered everyone by banging on about electromagnetic radiation and wireless telegraphy more than a century ago. It all started because Bernie Ecclestone, the sport\u2019s chief executive, became worried about the perception that the modern F1 driver is little more than a puppet. Earlier this week the FIA, the sport\u2019s governing body, issued a list of messages that would be banned \u2013 some from Sunday\u2019s Singapore Grand Prix and others from the following race in Japan. The FIA, however, has made a partial backtrack after talks with the teams on Sunday. Messages concerning the driver\u2019s own performance will still not be allowed \u2013 but the expected ban on those relating to the car\u2019s performance will be postponed until 2015. The teams are still unhappy, though. Franz Tost, the Toro Rosso team principal, said: \u201cIt is absolute nonsense what we have discussed because in all other sports the coach can give information and instructions and this does not mean the sportsman cannot do his job. He just does it in a better way. I don\u2019t understand it.\u201d Pat Symonds, chief technical officer for Williams, added: \u201cThe whole thing has been handled hastily. It\u2019s a team sport. I don\u2019t see any difference between an engineer advising a driver how to drive and a caddie helping a golfer choose an iron. Golf is not a team sport but that is perfectly permissible. Racing is a team sport. Should drivers get out and change the tyres during a pitstop?\u201d He added: \u201cWe want personalities in the sport and if the personalities are engineers and not just drivers what\u2019s wrong with that? I think the banter between the engineer and a driver is a good thing.\u201d As for the FIA, the race director, Charlie Whiting, admits there will be problems policing coded radio messages. He said: \u201cI agree it won\u2019t be straightforward.\u201d Chaos and confusion vie for pole in Singapore. Meanwhile, there is still a race to be run. Singapore is full of people who, in all truth would rather be elsewhere, for this is a popular staging post for long-haulers on their way to somewhere even more exotic. The Marina Bay Street Circuit, however, is a favourite for F1 fans, the sport\u2019s original night race in which the drivers and teams \u2013 and many spectators \u2013 keep their watches resolutely set on UK time. Formula One folk arrive at the track as dusk closes in, nightshift workers battling their way past those on their way home from more regular employment. The narrative, however, remains doggedly the same: it\u2019s Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg in one of the most compelling seasons in years. \u201cI am so excited for this weekend,\u201d said Hamilton. \u201cThe season has been incredible and Singapore is such an amazing place and marks the beginning of the last phase. The night race is fantastic. This is one of the very few places I travel to where I could live. The circuit is just incredible. It\u2019s difficult because we stay on European time. This morning I woke up at 1pm, went to bed at 5am. When I am having lunch everyone is having dinner. When I want to go to the gym in the middle of the night it is closed. It closes at 10pm. Very, very, strange.\u201d Hamilton must find it even stranger that he has won six races this season yet is 22 points behind his team-mate Rosberg. \u201cWhen I have made mistakes, I\u2019ve recovered,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd even when the car \u2013 which has been the majority of the time \u2013 has had a mistake, then I have generally recovered from it, so I feel like I have come back and maximised in every race, given the scenarios in front of me. I am nearly 30 and the experiences I have had have helped massively. I am getting older and managing things better.\u201d Hamilton certainly managed practice well on Friday, finishing top in the second session, some 12 places ahead of Rosberg.

Busloads of Singaporeans are expected to make their way to neighbouring Malaysia to see the film. Here are some other films that have been made off-limits by state or local censors.  Crash (1996) When it was first released, the David Cronenberg adaptation of JG Ballard\u2019s psycho-sexual erotic car crash novel was deemed so depraved that it was banned by Westminster council, meaning the British-Canadian production could not be shown anywhere in London\u2019s West End. However, cinema-goers just needed to take a short walk to the non-Westminster end of Shaftesbury Avenue to watch the film. Another film that was famously banned in 39 local authorities in the UK was Monty Python\u2019s Life of Brian. Cannibal Holocaust (1980) One of the most widely banned movies of all time, this gruesome Italian horror film featured an obscene amount of blood, guts and sexual assault. It was rumoured to be a genuine snuff film: the director Ruggero Deodato was arrested and charged with filming actors being killed (he was later cleared). The film, shot on location in the Amazon rainforest, also showed real footage of animals being slaughtered. In addition to Italy, it was banned in several other countries, including Norway, Germany and Australia.      L\u2019Age d\u2019Or: \u2018surprisingly explicit\u2019. Photograph: PR    L\u2019Age d\u2019Or (1930) This Luis Bu\u00f1uel-directed, Salvador Dal\u00ed-scripted surrealist film so incensed the French establishment that it was briefly banned in Paris \u201cin the name of public order\u201d. One of the first French \u201ctalkies\u201d, over its 63 minutes it portrayed surprisingly explicit sex and violence (including the most famous toe-sucking scene in cinematic history), mocked the bourgeoisie, and did everything it could to provoke the Roman Catholic church, culminating in a scene of a crucifix covered in women\u2019s scalps. The Circle (2000) After making two critically acclaimed films about children in his own country, Iranian director Jafar Panahi made The Circle, a much more serious project that dealt with the treatment of women in Iran, told from the viewpoint of four different characters. Authorities declared that the film was \u201coffensive to Muslim women\u201d, banned it before it was released, banned his next two films, and finally imposed a 20-year ban on Panahi making films. His following projects, This Is Not a Film and Closed Curtain, were made illegally and had to be smuggled out of the country.

Total European farm exports to Russia are worth some \u20ac11bn a year, with 29% of all fresh fruit and veg grown in the union and 33% of all cheese finding its way to the Russian market. Copa-Cogeca, the umbrella group representing European farmers, says prices in both sectors have fallen by as much as 80% in some countries. It is calling for urgent help from Brussels: funds to compensate growers facing difficulties, but also action to help cut the red tape and trade regulations that can prevent European growers from selling into alternative world markets in south America, north Africa and the far east. In the meantime, though, fruit is withering on trees and vegetables are rotting in the ground.  Poland Polish apples are among the worst affected. Last year, Polish growers sold around \u20ac840m of fresh produce to Russia, including 700,000 tonnes of apples \u2013 a quarter of its entire crop. According to the Polish Fruit Union, prices have fallen so far that farmers, assuming they can sell, are only just covering their costs. And the knock-on effect of thousands of tonnes of cheap Polish apples flooding on to western European markets is starting to hurt growers in France, too. While touting their wares in countries as far afield as Algeria, Taiwan, India and Singapore, Poland\u2019s farmers have high hopes of persuading American consumers to buy Polish \u201cFreedom Apples\u201d. Greece Greece exported 160,000 tonnes of fruit to Russia last year, worth around \u20ac180m to the country\u2019s struggling economy. But when 250 truckloads of peaches and nectarines on their way to Russia were turned back from the border in August, the produce either rotted or was sold at knockdown prices to buyers in countries on the way back. Incofruit-Hellas, the Greek fruit export association, says it is now seriously worried that oversupply will end up hitting the entire fresh produce market at a time when Greece desperately needs the money. Netherlands Dutch fruit and vegetable sales to Russia were worth some \u20ac600m in 2013, says the Frugi Venta trade association \u2013 which represents 420 Dutch companies. But prices for some products have now fallen by 75-80%, and hundreds of trucks have been turned back. Growers in Holland fear prices for aubergines, peppers, tomatoes and cucumbers will collapse within months, while some 900 hectares of Dutch fruit orchards \u2013 particularly pears \u2013 may be left unpicked this autumn because sale prices will not cover the cost of harvesting. Spain The Spanish lemon growers\u2019 organisation Ailimpo is confident Moscow\u2019s ban should not affect the early part of its season, since lemon exports to Russia generally get underway in March and sales there only represent about 3% of Spain\u2019s total output. But the association is still pressing Brussels to include lemons in the list of products covered by compensation schemes \u201cto give a positive signal to growers that aid is available should problems arise, and to avoid buyers exploiting the ban by introducing speculative pricing\u201d. Lithuania The small Baltic state is the second-biggest EU exporter of fresh fruit and nuts to Russia after Poland, with exports worth \u20ac309m in 2013, and the biggest exporter of fresh vegetables, worth \u20ac340m: the country\u2019s food exports to Russia account for a daunting 2.7% of its GDP.

The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) blamed new anti-extravagance drives in China, the stronger pound and an economic slowdown in some markets for the decline in Asia and the Americas, two of the industry\u2019s fastest-growing regions. The association said exports of blended and malt whisky fell from \u00a32bn in the first six months of 2013 to \u00a31.77bn for the same period this year \u2013 the largest half-yearly decline in 15 years. The figures present a significant headache for the SWA\u2019s recently appointed chief executive, David Frost, who said the drop proved the UK government had to continue bringing down trade barriers and restrictions. The association is expected to ramp up pressure for a 2% cut in excise duty. Frost also said it would start consulting its members, dominated by global drinks giants such as Diageo, Pernod Ricard and Suntory, over the tax and regulatory reforms that could follow greater devolution for Scotland. \u201cThe latest figures also act as a reminder that the success of scotch whisky can\u2019t be taken for granted. We need support from government to beat down trade barriers and help us access new markets overseas,\u201d Frost said. \u201cThat is why we are determined to play a full part in the forthcoming debate about further devolution, so that it enables a supportive business environment to ensure the future success of scotch whisky.\u201d The association said it would study the UK and Scottish government proposals for greater devolution after last week\u2019s independence referendum, in which voters chose to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%. A spokeswoman refused to speculate on the powers that could be handed over to the Scottish parliament. The ruling Scottish National party in the devolved government in Edinburgh has previously raised the prospect of devolving excise duty and has recently pushed hard to devolve corporation tax. The latest figures end a long period of booming sales and export records as whisky sales expanded rapidly in South America, particularly Brazil, and south-east Asia. The association said sales in China, where scotch is regarded among the newly rich as a symbol of significant affluence and status, had fallen 35%, down from \u00a325m to \u00a315m. While that puts China only 28th in the global rankings for whisky sales, the Chinese market is also supplied heavily via Singapore, which saw its whisky imports collapse by 46% from \u00a3174m to \u00a394m. Sales also fell 16% in the US to \u00a3328m, 46% in Singapore to \u00a394m, 19% in Brazil to \u00a340m, 27% in Mexico to \u00a339m and by 22% in Germany to \u00a365m, marking a significant reversal in fortunes in those markets. The SWA said the first half of any year tended to be quieter than the second half, primarily because of market cycles and festivals such as Christmas that fall late in the year. The association\u2019s spokeswoman confirmed, however, that this was the most significant half-year drop since 1999, when sales fell by 14%. There have been other half-yearly declines, with modest falls in 2012 and 2009, but they were made up for by sales in the second half of those years. The SWA added that sales increased in some important new and traditional markets: in Taiwan up by 39% to \u00a391m, in Japan by 18% to \u00a332.5m, in the UAE by 26% to \u00a354m - because it acts as a distribution hub to other markets - in India by 31% to \u00a336m and in France by 6% to \u00a3211m. France is the industry\u2019s biggest market by volume. The association highlighted sales growth in the \u201cdifficult market\u201d of India, where the UK government and the SWA have been in open conflict over counterfeiting and import barriers. India also has a popular indigenous whisky industry in competition with Scotch. Frost said: \u201cWe are confident that Scotch whisky will continue to grow in the long-term as markets stabilise and new ones, such as emerging economies across Africa, open up. However, it is clear that in the short-run that there are economic headwinds affecting exports.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/22/apple-new-iphones-first-sale", "sentences": ["This year it was released simultaneously in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-22T13:55:00Z", "title": "Apple sells 10m new iPhones in first three days on sale", "tags": ["iPhone 6", "Apple", "iPhone", "Smartphones", "Mobile phones", "Technology", "Telecoms", "Business"], "article": "Apple says it sold more than 10m of its new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models in the three days after they went on sale on Friday, setting a new record despite the phones not being available in China.

The number of iPhones bought in the first three days after new models go on sale has ramped up over the years as Apple\u2019s user base has increased, giving it a growing number of customers looking to upgrade, and the number of mobile carriers that it works with has grown.

From 26 September Apple will extend that to another 20 countries, and it will be on sale in 115 countries by the end of the year.

The government there has not yet approved the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus for sale, although previous generations of Apple\u2019s products have sold strongly there. No reason has been given - though there is speculation that the delay is to give local rivals a better chance to win sales, or that the authorities may be concerned that Apple has made the phones more difficult to tap by increasing security.

In a survey by Gazelle, a Boston-based phone trade-in company, a third of Android users said they were likely to move to the iPhone 6, up from about 10% a year ago when the iPhone 5S and 5C first went on sale. Use of Android phones is far higher outside the US, making up around 80% of handset sales, according to data from IDC. Apple\u2019s introduction of a 5.5in phone aims to catch the rising wave of sales of such \u201cphablet\u201d (for phone-tablet) devices, which IDC says made up over 20% of all smartphone sales in China in 2013. The number of iPhones bought in the first three days after new models go on sale has climbed over the years as Apple\u2019s user base has increased, giving it a growing number of customers looking to upgrade. At the same time, the number of mobile carriers that work with Apple has grown. This year the new phone was released simultaneously in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Puerto Rico, and Singapore. From 26 September Apple will offer the phone in another 20 countries, and it will be on sale in 115 countries by the end of the year. Apple has continued selling the iPhone 5S and 5C, at reduced prices. The new figures exclude sales of those handsets. The Chinese government has not yet approved the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus for sale, although previous generations of Apple\u2019s products have sold strongly there. No reason has been given, and there is speculation that the delay is to give local rivals a better chance to win sales, or because the authorities may be concerned that Apple has made the phones more difficult to tap by increasing security."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2014/sep/23/ftse-slumps-tate-lyle-profit-warning", "sentences": ["There was also a prolonged shutdown of its sucralose plant in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-23T08:35:42Z", "title": "FTSE slumps again while Tate & Lyle loses 17% after profit warning", "tags": ["Business", "Tate and Lyle", "AstraZeneca", "Shire", "Smith and Nephew", "Tesco", "Randgold Resources", "BHP Billiton", "Go-Ahead"], "article": "With markets heading south again on fading hopes of healthcare bids and poor eurozone manufacturing surveys, the day&apos;s big loser so far is Tate and Lyle after a shock profit warning. The group said disruption in its supply chain and increased competition for its Splenda sucrolose sweetener in the second quarter would hit its full year results. It said it expected additional costs of around \u00a320m in the second quarter taking the total for the first half to \u00a340m. There would be an additional \u00a310m of costs in the second half, meaning it now expected full year profits to be between \u00a3230m and \u00a3245m. Analysts had been expecting a figure of around \u00a3293m. It blamed supply constraints following a severe winter in the US leaving it with much lower than usual inventories. There was also a prolonged shutdown of its sucralose plant in Singapore. It said:  The disruption to our global supply chain persisted longer than we anticipated, caused by challenges in our plant network, low absolute levels of inventory and misalignments between customer demand and inventory available (particularly from the emerging markets.)  Chief executive Javed Ahmed said he had started an immediate review of our planning and supply chain processes. The news has sent Tate&apos;s shares plunging 17% or 127p to 605.5p. Mike van Dulken at Accendo Markets said:  Tate &amp; Lyle is today&apos;s Tesco after delivering a profits warning linked to a challenging start to the year following supply chain disruption and increased competition. While supply constraints were highlighted in July&apos;s update they lasted longer than predicted and, with management describing the first half as extremely disappointing and this being the second warning in 2014, shareholders have said enough is enough and dealt the shares the same punishment as they did in February by lopping another 17% from the share price.  Overall the FTSE 100 has dropped 70.21 points to 6703.42, its lowest level since 15 August. A slightly better than expected Chinese manufacturing survey, showing mild expansion rather than the feared contraction, has been outweighed by disappointing European numbers. French business activity contracted in September and Germany;s manufacturing sector grew at its slowest pace since June 2013. On top of that, a number of healthcare shares have been hit by overnight news that the US has introduced new rules to reduce the benefits available to its companies buying overseas businesses for tax reasons. This makes deals for AstraZeneca, pursued by Pfizer, and Shire, being acquired by AbbVie, and Smith and Nephew, less attractive, said traders. So AstraZeneca has dropped 238p to 4339.5p, Shire is down 340p to \u00a348.90 and Smith &amp; Nephew is off 32p to \u00a310.36. The three accounted for around 20 points of the FTSE 100&apos;s fall. Meanwhile Tesco has lost another 5p to 198p despite parachuting in new finance director Alan Stewart several weeks early. A number of analysts cut their target prices, including Exane BNP Paribas, Nomura, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. But with the Chinese figures coming in better than expected, mining shares have regained some ground, with Randgold Resources rising 50p to \u00a343.15 and BHP Billiton 16.5p better at \u00a317.47. Go-Ahead has accelerated 70p to \u00a325.13 after Deutsche Bank moved from hold to buy and raised its target price on the transport group from \u00a322.70 to \u00a327.90. The bank said:  We are revising our forecasts for the Thameslink (GTR) win and Southeastern extension. GTR adds both a significant and relatively low risk earnings stream (because Go-Ahead is not taking passenger revenue risk) albeit cost execution risks on integration are potentially high. The Southeastern direct award is an expected but outright positive that extends refranchise risk and resets the margin to a typical 3% from our estimate of less than 1% currently. On our forecast changes we believe consensus for 2016 plus is potentially too low. As such we upgrade to buy, albeit with a view that greater long-term value will be attributed to new bus targets which are as yet unannounced.

Resentful comments by Guardian readers are understandable. Yet I think your article (Who said Britons were drunk, dirty and deplorable?, 20 September) misses the point of the book and fails to capture the context of its success in Portugal. I think Magueijo\u2019s book is not so much a cheap xenophobic picture of the British but rather a satire on ever-present and deeply ingrained self-images of Portugal in Portuguese public discourse. Magueijo himself pointed in the interview to Lord Byron\u2019s disdainful accounts of Portugal in the early years of the 19th century, which are typical of the socio- and ethnocentric travel writing of the time. But I doubt the way in which the Portuguese cultural elites took these images to heart is so typical. The most talented Portuguese writer of the late 19th century, E\u00e7a de Queiroz, often referred in his novels to idealised accounts of Britain as either an Oxonian paradise or a futuristic benign utopia, as rhetorical counterpart to a hopelessly decadent Portuguese society. That, say, the mass of the population in British urban centres were mired in squalor at that time was a fact never worth mentioning in his works. This idealisation of Britain remains a constant trope in Portuguese literature and arts to this day. In fact it is not just Britain that is held at such absurd lofty heights by Portuguese artists. Take the example of Jo\u00e3o Canijo, an excellent contemporary Portuguese cinema director. In an interview given in 2010, he could be heard deploring the unrepentant \u201cignorance\u201d of the Portuguese when compared to what happened in France, where, he claimed, even young delinquents were fully knowledgable about the works of Jean Racine. In time, this discourse seeped into political discourse. Politicians and pundits alike rush to point how the Portuguese should be in awe of the media-darling country of the day \u2013 say, Singapore and Ireland, if you are a right-winger campaigning for labour and financial deregulation, Finland if you are a left-winger emphasising the role of education on economic and social development \u2013 and how Portugal\u2019s problems would vanish at once if we just had the courage turn the country upside down to copy them. These types of comparisons are of lesser importance \u2013 role-model countries come and go at great pace these days \u2013 and not exclusive to Portugal. But they can have far more sinister overtones. And none more so than in the current context of deep economic crisis. Indeed, they paved the way for a very convenient narrative in which recession was not caused by the shockwaves of the bursting of a colossal global financial bubble, but was the result of perennial flaws of the Portuguese national character finally catching up with us. In this framework, the Portuguese were allegedly lazy, risk-averse losers tanning in the sun who were living beyond their means and thus totally dependent on an inefficient welfare state and on the goodwill of honest bankers \u2013 and were duly punished by market forces after 2010. What is more astonishing is how this bordering-on-racist narrative was taken as self-evident and reproduced by the Portuguese media and by the current Portuguese government. This despite every bit of hard data pointing to its falseness. The fact that Portuguese work significantly more hours and for significantly lower wages than the OECD average, and that most of the growth in Portuguese families\u2019 indebtedness in the past 20 years is explained by the acquisition of housing in a deregulated housing market, is overlooked. So too are the tremendous achievements of the Portuguese welfare state in health and, more recently, in education and the fight against poverty, despite having far less resources than most of its European counterparts. Yet I would venture that in no other European country was there such an overwhelming consensus on austerity \u2013 and the idealisation of other countries as opposed to the alleged rottenness of Portugal played a key role in legitimising that. This is why I think Magueijo\u2019s book struck a chord in Portugal. He is simply turning a deep-seated rhetorical trope on its head. What if, for once, instead of the age-old practice of comparing the worst there is in Portugal to the best that can be found abroad, we switched roles? For him, Britain just happened to be the perfect subject for this exercise: a country with which he is familiar and which is revered by Portugal\u2019s political, economic and artistic elites. It is the latter that the joke is on, not on the British.Pedro Est\u00eav\u00e3oLisbon, Portugal"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/25/ad-break-derek-jeter-gatorade-william-shatner", "sentences": ["It&apos;s also the first of two adverts in this week&apos;s collection featuring the classic song My Way.Agency: BBH (Singapore)Director: Jones+Tino Gatorade: &apos;Derek Jeter&apos; (starts at 04:51) - US Ad Break has already featured one commercial marking Derek Jeter&apos;s retirement this year and it&apos;s a measure of his impact on baseball that this second epic also plays fulsome tribute to the star."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-25T10:46:00Z", "title": "Ad break: Derek Jeter's Gatorade tribute, William Shatner's Queen cover", "tags": ["Advertising", "Media", "Baseball", "Sport", "US news", "UK news"], "article": "     Thomson Holidays: &apos;Discover Your Smile&apos; (starts at 00:06) - UK William Shatner&apos;s eye-watering version of Bohemian Rhapsody provides a fascinating counterpoint to the action as we see a much-loved teddy bear being taken on a family holiday in this travel agency commercial.

BlackBerry Passport review &gt;&gt; The Verge Dan Seifert:   BlackBerry is also trying to rectify accessing your work email, documents, and communications across the various devices in your life with BlackBerry Blend. Blend lets you connect your iPad, Android tablet, Windows PC, or Mac to your BlackBerry via USB, Wi-Fi, or cellular networks and access your BBM messages, email accounts, calendar and other things without picking up your phone. It&apos;s designed to keep everything segregated \u2014 your work email and calendar never integrate with your personal ones and no work data gets stored on the computer or tablet. BlackBerry wasn&apos;t able to provide a way for me to test Blend in time for this review, but the demo I was shown performed as promised. It&apos;s something that will likely make IT managers at BlackBerry&apos;s corporate customers happy, if not the BlackBerry users themselves. Like the Passport&apos;s hardware design, BlackBerry 10.3 got in the way of me being productive more than it helped me. I can&apos;t archive anything in the email app, which is soul-crushing for this Gmail user. Collaborating on Google Drive documents with my colleagues is all but impossible on the Passport. I also can&apos;t confer with my coworkers on the Passport with our group chat app of choice (Slack), so it was difficult to fully integrate it into my mobile workflow.  With due respect to Seifert (who has done a thorough review), the people at whom the Passport is aimed probably don&apos;t use Google mail or calendars or documents. It&apos;s for governments and businesses wanting high security. In that sense, the ruler against which the Passport is generally being measured simply isn&apos;t appropriate.

The number is still lower than the global average of 49%, or the 40% recorded in Thailand, the market researcher said. Fifty-one percent of people in Malaysia have a smartphone, while the figure in Singapore is 85 percent, according to TNS.  49% of mobile users have a smartphone? That figure sneaked in quietly. The rise of the hacker bounty hunter &gt;&gt; NYMag Kevin Roose:   HackerOne is a sort of start-up security bazaar, built not on the hacker principles of vandalism or greed but something much more like monetized goodwill\u2014a crackerjack coder discovers a corporate vulnerability, writes a note to company HQ, gets a thank-you note and often a payment (anywhere from $25 to $5,000 and up) in return. On the flip side, a company like Secret\u2014or Twitter, Yahoo, and Square, all of which run programs through the site\u2014gets to mobilize a volunteer IT army. HackerOne provides the infrastructure for these arrangements but stays out of the deals themselves, merely tacking on a 20 percent fee for each successful bounty. Think of it as TaskRabbit for hackers. Bug-bounty programs aren&apos;t new in the IT world. (Netscape ran one in 1995, offering T-shirts and mugs to hackers who found software glitches.) But today&apos;s efforts are bigger and more systematized. Since opening for business in 2012, HackerOne has raised $9 million from investors and staffed up to 18 employees, making it a mainstream tech player in its own right.

The boys, who have severe social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, are among the most troubled and troubling children in the country and have been excluded from their previous, mainstream schools. They are also about to appear on television, as the subjects of the latest documentary tracing the everyday ups and downs of school-life, following the hugely popular Educating Yorkshire, Essex and now the East End. The boys\u2019 stories feature poverty and bereavement; they may have witnessed domestic violence or murder. Their homes are unstable, their accomodation is crowded and temporary. This week a new boy kicked in a window at school. It turned out his family were to be evicted the next morning and he didn\u2019t know where he was going to live. By the end of the two part documentary, which starts next week, it is hard not to appreciate the boys\u2019 good fortune at having found themselves in the care of such an unorthodox institution, in one of the capital\u2019s poorest boroughs, Tower Hamlets. Here there are no uniforms, no rules, no physical restraint, no bars, no isolation rooms, no detentions, no punishment. Everyone is on first name terms \u2013 staff and students. If you swear (the boys do, a lot), you will be challenged (\u201cLanguage please!\u201d) but there are no sanctions; if you walk out of class no one will force you back in, if you get in to a fight, a member of staff will intervene if it looks like someone is going to get hurt, but you won\u2019t get excluded. The Guardian visits on the day Sir Michael Wilshaw publishes his Ofsted report on the damaging impact of low-level disruption in classrooms, in which he complains about unruly pupils humming and fidgeting. Headteacher Claire Lillis is scathing. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is a national report. It\u2019s a national disgrace.\u201d What, in turn, would Sir Michael make of the local authority funded Ian Mikardo? In the first episode of the documentary, new boy Matthew, 13, is causing ructions. Cries of \u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d ring out, boys throw paper at each other, one spits in the other\u2019s face. In a Design Technology lesson someone holds a drill up at another child\u2019s face; Matthew puts someone in a headlock and the community police officer is called in to talk to him. A school trip to the local ice rink ends in near chaos with children running out of control. \u201cThis is a disaster,\u201d admits one member of staff. \u201cI\u2019m phoning the police,\u201d says another. In the second episode, James, 12, another new boy, refuses to talk to staff, refuses to go to class. He taunts and picks on another boy, and to everyone\u2019s alarm climbs the banister high above the staircase putting himself in danger. Humming and fidgeting don\u2019t seem to be the problem. \u201cIf a teacher spent their time picking up on all low level incidents, students would learn very quickly how to distract the teacher from the lesson,\u201d says Lillis. \u201cThe skill of the teacher is to pick up on low level incidents that if ignored may escalate to a serious incident.\u201d She is contemptuous of Sir Michael\u2019s criticism about heads \u201cblurring the lines between friendliness and familiarity\u201d. \u201cThis is incredibly superficial and a simplistic view of teaching and what matters. It is not what a teacher wears, or their name, that makes a good teacher or gains student respect, it is the quality of their teaching and the relationship that they have with their students and colleagues. \u201cIf all of the profession suddenly wore suits would this lead to a better educated Britain?\u201d (Lillis is wearing a smart black shirt, jeans, red shoes, and has a few discreet piercings and tattoos.) \u201cOne can be a professional without being in a suit.\u201d Lillis is speaking from a position of authority. She has been head at Ian Mikardo for 13 years and in that time has received three outstanding Ofsted reports. The school\u2019s motto is \u201cCome with a past, leave with a future\u201d, and the boys overwhelmingly do. When she took over the school, it was in special measures and all the boys who walked through its doors ended up in prison. By contrast, in the past three years, 97% have gone on to further education, employment or training and no one has found their way into custody in the past seven years. They make \u201coutstanding\u201d educational progress and leave with a range of vocational and academic qualifications. The school\u2019s guiding principles are empathy, respect, being non-judgemental and listening. This is, Lillis points out, a special school \u2013 there are only 40 boys, a maximum of eight to a class and in-house psychotherapists, one dedicated to children, the other to staff. Not every school can be like this, but she clearly believes that much of what goes on here could be applied elsewhere. The building is colourful and inviting. There\u2019s a rescue dog called McFlurry that the boys (and staff) dote on; the dining room has a juke box which seems to play all the time and there\u2019s a flat where the boys can relax at lunchtime and where they have lessons in how to cook, wash and iron. Elsewhere there\u2019s a salon, where they can get haircuts, manicures and facials. It creates an easy, intimate atmosphere where even the most aggressive boys soften and have their spots squeezed and eyebrows shaped. They also learn about personal hygiene. The atmosphere is calm and good-humoured, but the staff are constantly on alert, watching for signs of tension and intervening before anything erupts. During the course of photographs being taken one of the boys pockets the photographer\u2019s phone. \u201cHe always gives stuff back,\u201d says Lillis, and he does, holding it way above the photographer\u2019s head so she can\u2019t reach it before finally handing it over. The head\u2019s keys go missing; they quickly turn up. James, so closed and angry in the second episode, is there fresh-faced and laughing with the other boys. Lillis is anxious about the documentary going out \u2013 extra support will be provided for the boys and their families \u2013 but she felt it was worth doing to encourage the public to empathise with the boys in her care and the difficulties their families face. \u201cThe current government has taken a real punitive stance in education and against families who have difficulties. Some parts of the media have run with that and glorified it. \u201cI wanted to give a voice to those who have been under attack and also challenge what it is that we are trying to do with education. We\u2019ve lost sight of what education means.\u201d The world has changed dramatically in the past few decades, she says, \u201cyet we are trying to have an education system that has not progressed and has not moved with society.\u201d Talking about the perils of idle chatting, she says: \u201cWhy are we trying to silence our children? They are locked into screens a lot of time. We need to encourage more oracy at school.\u201d Reacting to Pisa international league tables and the current obsession around learning from education systems in Singapore and elsewhere, she says: \u201cWe need to stop comparing ourselves to global markets and Asia. Where\u2019s the innovation and creativity gone in Britain? \u201cWe need to play again. We need to be creative. We need to get enjoyment again into our schools and our classrooms.\u201d She also warns against restrictions. \u201cThe more we try and suppress our youth, [the more likely it is] we will end with another form of riots and it will be far worse than it was a few years ago.\u201d Too Tough to Teach?

The region has been named Best Culinary Destination (large international) in the magazine\u2019s 2014 Culinary Travel Awards. \u201cThe hallmark cuisine of the city is emphatically Cantonese,\u201d writes the magazine, and of course any visitor should try the excellent Cantonese restaurants (my current favourites are The Boss and The Chairman, both in Central). But Hong Kong also offers a good number of cuisines from the mainland. Because of the large number of Chiu Chow, Shanghainese and Hakka people living here, it\u2019s always been fairly easy to find restaurants serving those cuisines. But as the Special Administrative Region receives more Chinese tourists from across the border, restaurants have opened serving authentic versions of the heartier and spicier dishes from places such as Beijing, Sichuan and Hunan that are not toned down (as they previously were) for local tastes. Here are 10 regional cuisines you\u2019ll find in Hong Kong, and the restaurants to try them in. Shanghainese The cuisine of Shanghai is commonly described as being rich and oily, with a lot of heavy brown sauces, although it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that way. One of their most famous dishes is xiao long bao \u2013 also known as soup dumplings \u2013 which, if done right, are small, light and delicate. Also light (in texture, though not in flavour) are the famous drunken dishes, made by immersing cooked meat (chicken is the most popular) in rice wine mixed with other flavourings, and leaving it to infuse for at least a day. At Shanghai Lu Yang Cun Restaurant, start with several cold dishes, choosing them for their mix of flavours and textures, such as drunken chicken, pressed spice beef shin, fine shreds of bean curd skin with fresh soybeans, mashed soybeans flavoured with sesame oil and preserved vegetables, and jellied ham terrine. Proceed to main courses such as tiny river shrimps cooked with tea leaves, braised pork shoulder, lion\u2019s head meatballs (so called because the pork meatballs are cooked with Chinese cabbage leaves, which are said to resemble a lion\u2019s mane) and stir-fried rice cakes. If it\u2019s winter, be sure to try one of the hairy crab dishes. The crustaceans, eaten primarily for their rich roe, are either steamed and served whole with brown vinegar and slivers of ginger, or the meat and roe are taken from the shell and served with noodles, rice or beancurd. Be warned, though, Shanghai crab is expensive. \u2022 Shanghai Lu Yang Cun Restaurant, 11/F World Trade Centre, 280 Gloucester Road, Causeway Bay, +852 2881 6669. About HK$300 (around \u00a324) per person (much more expensive if you order hairy crab) Chiu Chow     Chao Hui Guan, Hong Kong. Photograph: http://chaohuiguan.com    A Chiu Chow (also Teochew) meal will begin and end with tiny cups of strong kung fu tea, which cleanse the palate and help to promote digestion. The cuisine, from the Chaoshan region in Guangdong province, is light but flavourful, and is known for its braised master sauce dishes, especially goose and bean curd, which are served tepid or warm, and eaten with a white vinegar dipping sauce. At Chao Hui Guan, the lu shui (master sauce), goose intestines and thick slices of fatty goose liver are especially good. I also like the fresh small oysters that are cooked with eggs and starch to make an omelette that is drizzled with fish sauce (a fairly common seasoning in the cuisine), or simmered with rice, preserved vegetables and broth for congee. The raw and cooked seafood dishes are also delicious \u2013 although in the case of steamed flower crab, can be very expensive. Chiu Chow people like taro dishes, such as clay pot duck with taro, or de-boned, flattened cooked duck that\u2019s coated with mashed taro before being deep-fried \u2013 though not everyone appreciates the heavy sweet-savoury taro desserts. Pan-fried noodle cake served with sugar and vinegar is another classic sweet-savoury Chiu Chow dish that this restaurant does well.\u2022 Federal Mansion, 544-554 Fuk Wing Street, Cheung Sha Wan, +852 2682 9118. About HK$200 (\u00a316) per person Hakka Historically the Hakkas were the nomads of China: their name means \u201cguest families\u201d, because they migrated from central China to other parts of the mainland (and later many other countries in the world). The cuisine is hearty and strong, and because of the need to preserve food for their travels, salted, cured and pickled vegetables and meats are commonly used. Tofu in its many incarnations (fresh, pressed, preserved and dried) is another popular ingredient. At Chuen Cheung Kui, try the salt-baked chicken, steamed bean curd stuffed with pork, and steamed pork belly with either preserved mustard greens or thick slices of taro. \u2022 7/F-8/F Phase 1, Causeway Bay Plaza 1, 489 Hennessy Road, Causeway Bay, +852 2577 3833.

About HK$150 (\u00a312) per person Sichuan The cuisine of Sichuan province, south-west China, is best known for its ma la flavours \u2013 the numbing (ma) sensation that comes from Sichuan peppercorns, and spicy (la) from the many types of chillies \u2013 fresh, dried, preserved \u2013 that are used and made into sauces. But a good Sichuan meal won\u2019t be one-dimensionally tongue burning; the judicious use of other seasonings such as soy sauce, salt, sugar, vinegar and sesame oil or paste help to balance the flavours. Sichuan House is one of the newer Sichuan restaurants to open and the delicious food and excellent service has made it one of my favourites. Try the \u201cmouth-watering chicken\u201d (that\u2019s the actual translation of the dish\u2019s name), so called because it\u2019s so good it will get your saliva glands going), poached fish or beef in hot chilli oil, and the mapo doufu (tofu in chili and bean sauce). End the meal with caramelised apple or banana fritters. \u2022 7/F M88, 2 Wellington Street, Central, +852 2521 6699, sichuanhouse.com.hk. About HK$250 (\u00a320) per person Hunan The most obvious difference between food from Hunan province and that of nearby Sichuan is the near-absence of Sichuan peppercorns in the former. Most people know only of the spicy Hunan dishes, but the food can also be surprisingly light and delicate, or have an assertive smokiness from preserved meats. At Caf\u00e9 Hunan, the innocuous-sounding stir-fried potatoes with hot and sour sauce proves to be the spiciest, while yin yang fish head \u2013 completely covered on one side with yellow chillies and on the other with red ones \u2013 looks incendiary but is actually relatively mild. Also try the stir-fried pork with Youxian dried bean curd, and stir-fried baby chicken. \u2022 CKoon Wah Building, 420-424 Queen\u2019s Road West, Sheung Wan, +852 2803 7177.

Photograph: facebook.com/PUTIEN.RESTAURANT    As you\u2019d expect from a coastal province, the cuisine of Fujian places an emphasis on seafood. The province, on the south-east coast, is quite fertile, and the temperature is mostly mild, which means many vegetables and fruits thrive there. Putien (a variation on the spelling of the Fujian city of Putian) in Causeway Bay is the first Hong Kong branch of a Singapore-based chain. The so-called oyster omelette is more like oyster fritters, with lots of the small, plump bivalves in a light coating. Baked bamboo clams have a hint of Sichuan peppercorn, and are fresh and sweet. If you like innards and extremities, be sure to try the braised pig intestine and the fried pig\u2019s trotters. \u2022 7/F Lee Theatre Plaza, 99 Percival Street, Causeway Bay, +852 2111 8080, putien.com About HK$200 (\u00a316) per person  Yunnan Yunnan province, in the far south-west of China, is famous for its air-dried ham, which is intense and salty, and its huge variety of mushrooms, including Chinese black truffles, porcini, morels and chanterelles. The province\u2019s most famous dish is almost certainly crossing the bridge noodles, which, legend has it, got its name because a devoted wife brought the noodles across the bridge to where her husband-scholar was studying for exams. While the ingredients vary, the soup noodles should always have a thin layer of oil or fat floating on the surface, which keeps the broth hot. At Yunnan Rainbow, the dish is prepared tableside, with the raw ingredients and fine rice noodles poached in the broth. Other dishes to try are the chicken with garlic and soy sauce, dumplings with chilli oil, and any of the mushroom preparations. \u2022 Yah Ying Building, 18 Shelter Street, Causeway Bay, +852 2881 8992. About HK$200 (\u00a316) per person Beijing There\u2019s more to Beijing cuisine than just Peking (the old name for the Chinese capital) duck. Beijing Home does serve that dish, but it also has much more humble offerings. My favourites are the snacks: Beijing-style pig skin (which is more like a cold jellied terrine), a salad with peppers, cucumber and bean curd skin, and \u2013 best of all \u2013 shredded tripe with mustard. Also good is the Beijing-style crisp lamb, and excellent dumplings with thick, chewy handmade wrappers and filled with scrambled egg and tomatoes. \u2022 7/F Island Beverley, 1 George Street, Causeway Bay, +852 2761 3300. About HK$125 (\u00a310) per person  Xinxiang Xinjiang is the most northwesterly province in China, bordered by Mongolia and several of the \u201cStans\u201d. Because it is predominantly Muslim, beef, mutton and lamb are used more than pork, the most popular meat in other regions of China. Islam Food in Kowloon City has been serving halal food in Hong Kong since the 1950s, and the walls of this tiny place are lined with photos of celebrities who have dined there. By far its most famous dish is the oddly-named veal goulash cakes, which are actually pan-fried buns stuffed with a juicy beef filling. I also like the curried lamb, beef or ox tongue, and the breads, which are good accompaniments to the saucier dishes. \u2022 1 Lung Kong Road, Kowloon City, +852 2382 2822, islamfood.com.hk. Also at 33-35 Tak Ku Ling Road, Kowloon City, +852 2382 1882. About HK$100 (\u00a38) per person  Manchu Many people think that rice is essential to all Chinese meals, but as you travel north, rice gives way to wheat and other grains. The flavours of Manchuria, in north-east China, are hearty and pungent. You probably won\u2019t want to eat at Manchu Chinese Restaurant (which used to be known as Bistro Manchu, at the same address) if you have an important meeting the next day, because you\u2019ll end up reeking of garlic. Try the pan-fried pork dumplings, spicy shredded potatoes, and eggplant with garlic, chilli and sesame oil. For meats, order the house special garlic chicken and the cumin lamb, with which you should have a side dish of pliable crepes, to use as a wrapper. \u2022 33 Elgin Street, SoHo, +852 2244 3998.

Lim, who is in the final negotiations of a protracted takeover at the Spanish club, owns 100% of the economic rights in two players, the Spanish striker Rodrigo Moreno Machado and the Portuguese midfielder Andr\u00e9 Gomes, via his company Meriton Capital. Both were playing for Benfica, from whom Lim\u2019s company bought them in January, for \u20ac30m and \u20ac15m respectively. In the summer, Benfica loaned the players, now owned by Lim, to Valencia, a club Lim will buy once he reaches agreement with their main creditor, the Spanish conglomerate Bankia. Jorge Mendes, the agent, transfer intermediary and adviser to third-party ownership (TPO) funds, is a close friend of Lim and has been significantly involved with the acquisitions of Rodrigo and Gomes, as well as other moves to Valencia. The coach, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, was the first player whose transfer Mendes brokered, in 1997, and Mendes still represents Nuno. The class of 92 \u2013 Gary and Phil Neville, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes, who graduated through Manchester United\u2019s ranks to glittering football heights \u2013 announced last week that Lim has agreed to take a 50% share in their purchase of the Northern Premier League First Division North club Salford. It raised the question about whether Lim\u2019s intention is to use Salford, where the former United stars have pledged to build a productive academy, as a partner club in his growing football activities. Third-party ownership of players is banned in English football because of its perceived damage to the game\u2019s integrity and players\u2019 individual rights, and on Friday, following Uefa pressure, Fifa pledged to ban the practice worldwide. A spokesperson for Lim emphasised his involvement with Salford is \u201cphilanthropic\u201d, motivated by his interest in developing young players and has nothing to do with Valencia, Mendes or TPO. \u201cThe only reason for Peter\u2019s investment in Salford City is aligned with his personal philanthropic interest in youth development,\u201d the spokesperson said, \u201cand of course his support for the members of the class of 92.\u201d The former United quintet said when announcing the deal they had known Lim for 10 years \u2013 initially this was through his ownership of United\u2019s Red Cafe Asian franchise. He is already involved with the group in building a hotel, called Hotel Football, near Old Trafford at a reported cost of \u00a323m. Lim made his millions investing in shares and he supports training of young footballers in the Singapore Sports Foundation, where he is said to have invested substantially. Lim\u2019s spokesperson stressed he was not intending to develop a business in TPO. \u201cOur involvement in the third-party ownership of players is not a long-term one,\u201d the spokesperson, based in Singapore, said. \u201cThe case [sic] was mainly due to our acquisition of Valencia. We had submitted our offer to acquire Valencia in December 2013 and did not expect that it is a long and protracted one. We invested in the economic rights of Rodrigo and Andr\u00e9 during the January 2014 transfer window and it was solely for Valencia in mind. \u201cAfter the official support from the Valencia CF Foundation to sell the club to us (but before reaching an agreement with Bankia), the two players were on loan to Valencia for one year while we are trying to complete the transaction.\u201d The Neville brothers, Giggs, Scholes and Butt have not commented on the third-party ownership element of Lim\u2019s activities but are thought to consider it irrelevant because of the TPO ban here and because Salford City, in northern English semi-professional football, inhabit a different world from Mendes and Valencia. The former United stars took over Salford this year as part of developing a broad portfolio of interests and activities now their playing days are over. Such projects include the eponymous film that has branded them collectively the \u201cclass of 92\u201d. A unifying theme is to positively acknowledge their roots, including a strong connection with Salford \u2013 Giggs still lives in the city; Scholes was born there; United\u2019s Cliff and Littleton Road training grounds, where they were all schooled in football, are in Salford. The five have addressed concerns about whether British players have the same opportunities to progress as they did \u2013 Gary Neville has said publicly he does not believe he would be given a chance in United\u2019s first team if he were coming through now. At Salford, they have pledged to build an academy that will develop young British players. The ambition is to take the club from the raw lower reaches to the Football League, a journey almost certain to involve a move from the historic, but basic, ground at Moor Lane. Fleetwood Town, who have been promoted from two divisions below Salford, the North West Counties League first division, to League One in a decade, are explicitly a role model.

Today, it has less than 2,000. The surface area of the Aral Sea in central Asia has dropped by half, from 66,000 to 33,000 square km, and the Dead Sea in the Middle East from almost 1,000 to 650 square km. Fifty years from now, Lake Chad is at risk of disappearing altogether. Thirty years from now, the Aral Sea and the Dead Sea may become small lakes. China, the emerging superpower, may soon see Lake Poyang, its largest freshwater lake, evaporate \u2013 as many as 3,000 small lakes in the source region of the Yellow River have done so in the last two decades. As lakes disappear, rivers are either being depleted or severely polluted. Large stretches of the Ganges, the Nile, and the Yangtze are already biologically dead. Over the next thirty years, some of the mightiest rivers in the world \u2013 including the Yellow and the Yangtze, the Ganges and the Indus, the Euphrates and the Jordan, and the Nile \u2013 will see a reduction of at least 25-30% in their flow from evaporation, desertification, climate change, and pollution. The climate change debate is highly focused on atmospheric pollution and energy use, but there is a growing realisation of the close links between climatic and environmental factors and the future flow and quality of water through melting glaciers, deforestation, changes in precipitation, and emission of waste into fresh water. The next thirty years will also see a strong increase in demand for water \u2013 for hydroelectricity, irrigation, and urbanization. At the same time, the 25-30% reduction in water flow will lead to a drop in food grain production in China, India, Bangladesh, Egypt, and the Middle East. The net result of this decrease will be a gap between demand and supply of food grains of approximately 200 to 300 million tons by 2040 in international markets. China and India, reasonably self-sufficient in 2014, may become major importers of food grains by 2040. If all this unfolds, commodity prices will skyrocket, affecting the poor worldwide and making food riots, migration, and conflicts within and between countries inevitable.     Areas of hydro insecurity Photograph: Strategic Foresight Group    The main theatre of crisis and conflict driven by depletion of water resources will be from south-east Asia via South Asia and Central Asia to Turkey and from Egypt along the eastern and central parts of Africa to Kenya and Burundi. What could change this ominous scenario? The good news is that mere decline in the availability of water does not necessarily lead to violence. Singapore and Senegal are examples of how to avoid conflict through good water governance and transboundary cooperation. A recent study by Strategic Foresight Group (SFG) on 205 shared river basins from 148 countries concludes: \u201cany two countries engaged in active water cooperation do not go to war for any reason whatsoever, including land, religion, economy or terrorism.\u201d The key to peace thus lies in the intensity of cooperation as measured by the water cooperation quotient (WCQ) the report introduces. The WCQ is a new tool developed by SFG and introduced to the international community by Jordan\u2019s Prince Hassan, chair of the United Nations Secretary-Generals\u2019 Advisory Board on Water &amp; Sanitation. It uses ten parameters \u2013 including economic, environmental, institutional, legal, political, and technical factors \u2013 to examine both legal and operational cooperation between countries that share a water body. Countries are assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with countries at risk scoring below 35. To promote active water cooperation, the Blue Peace framework \u2013 which defines a structured process to turn water from a source of potential crisis to an instrument of cooperation \u2013 is essential. Specifically, it consists of creating regional mechanisms for cooperation, engaging mainstream political leaders from rival river-boardering countries, and enabling them to negotiate trade-offs between water and other public goods. Such mechanisms are already in place in Europe, North and South America, and West Africa. The next decade will see the emergence of global mechanisms \u2013 innovative legal and diplomatic instruments \u2013 for resolving water-related disputes and promoting transboundary water cooperation. If the international community mobilises political will behind the new architecture of water and peace, the alternative grim scenario of water war can still be averted before the world crosses the tipping point.

Could we find a breakthrough that would cut 90% of the electricity required for space cooling? Air conditioners in use today work on the same principle as refrigerators, but instead of dumping the heat into the room (which is what happens at the back of a refrigerator) it is sent outdoors. Air conditioners use a lot of electricity because they involve repeated cycles of compressing a gas to a liquid, and that consumes power. In Singapore \u2013 a small, hot, developed country \u2013 about 30% of household power is used for air conditioning, and in commercial buildings it is 40%. Because much global economic development has happened, and will happen, in hot climates, the demand for air conditioning can be expected to increase markedly over the coming decade. There is a need for a much more energy efficient way to accomplish space cooling. The simplest thing to do is to refrain from excessively air conditioning a work or living space. A few degrees higher setting of the thermostat in those chilly restaurants, hotels, homes and offices would go a long way to saving energy. But what about the device itself? If the energy cost of compressing the gas back to a liquid is the critical step, is there any way to reduce or eliminate this? There is an old idea that is now being revived as a result of advances in chemical materials technology. Certain materials have a strong tendency to adsorb (that is bind to the surface) water vapour. When this happens, heat is released. Suppose that cool water vapour picks up heat from a hot room, and is then directed outside to where the adsorbing material is located. The water is trapped and the heat released to the atmosphere.  To get the water back off the material, as cool vapour, only a small amount of heat needs to be applied to the solid. Ideally this would come from solar energy, or from some other source of waste heat. If neither is available, a small electric heater is required. Devices cooling air on this principle are known as adsorption chillers. The problem is that until recently the materials available at a reasonable cost, such as silica gel (the stuff in those little packets you get with various purchases, to keep them dry) do not trap very much water, so you need a lot of them to cool a space. The resulting adsorption chillers are large and heavy \u2013 and weight is a consideration for air conditioners, which are often placed on a roof.  New materials are now being developed that are a step change in the amount of water they can hold. These materials are known as metal-organic framework (MOF) compounds.  Some of the recent ones, developed by Dr Raya al Dadah at the University of Birmingham, at Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf, and at MIT in the US, will adsorb more than four times as much water as silica gel. As the name implies, these materials are made of various metals, such as zirconium or chromium, bound together with a loose web of carbon atoms, so that there is a much greater surface area with sites where water molecules can be bound. But the work of the chemists and engineers is not done. Many materials will work well for a few cycles of adsorption and its reverse, desorption. But a commercial adsorption chiller needs to keep up this performance for thousands of cycles without requiring a change of the MOF.  The first materials are undergoing such tests, and if they succeed we might soon see commercial air conditioning using 10% of the energy required for today\u2019s units.

Mohamed appeared in Melbourne magistrates court on Thursday, where prosecutors alleged he frequently spoke with Hamdi Al Qudsi, arrested in Sydney last year for recruiting people to fight against Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Throughout September last year, prosecutor Mark Gibson said numerous phone calls were intercepted including one where Al Qudsi told Mohamed of a \u201cbig job coming up\u201d. \u201cThey have a big, big surgery, big operation coming up involving 1,500 holy warriors that may obtain martyrdom in the path of Allah,\u201d Al Qudsi is alleged to have said.

In another conversation they referred to \u201csoccer players\u201d being \u201cmentally ready\u201d. The same month, Mohamed allegedly bought a mobile phone and service at a shopping centre in Victoria\u2019s Sunshine West which he subscribed to using the false name, Chris Wright, police allege. Gibson alleged this was to avoid law enforcement while preparing to travel to Syria. On 16 September, a phone call was intercepted where Mohamed told an unknown man using a Sri Lankan phone service: \u201cI have spoken with the coach today, everything is ready his side.\u201d Mohamed travelled from Sydney to Brisbane on 21 September, where he was due to board a flight to Singapore, but was refused processing at customs.  He was told his New Zealand passport had been cancelled and recalled, and police allege he was uncooperative and evasive when asked about his travel movements.  A search of his luggage revealed a plastic bag labelled \u201cAbu Malik\u201d which contained an iPhone, Islamic headdress, chocolate and an Arabic book. Police allege Malik is another name for Mehmet Biber, who left Sydney in July last year and is now fighting in Syria. On 24 September, a phone call was intercepted where Mohamed told the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service that his reason for wanting to travel was because he was engaged to a girl in Denmark, and he planned to fly there via Singapore and then Turkey to meet her. Mohamed was unsure of his fiancee\u2019s name and birthday, police said. He was arrested in December last year by members of the joint counter-terrorism team, facing four charges of preparing for incursion into foreign states for the purpose of engaging in hostile activities, with each charge carrying a jail sentence of up to 10 years.  Under proposed new counter-terrorism laws, someone who is in Australia but is proven to have been preparing to engage in hostilities overseas could face life in jail. A separate new law could see entrants to certain hostile zones jailed for 10 years if they cannot point to a legitimate reason for their trip. But Mohamed was arrested last year so is being tried under existing laws, and prosecutors must prove he was planning to take up arms in Syria. His defence lawyer Michael O\u2019Connell told magistrate Jan MacLean that there was no evidence from prosecutors that \u201csheds any light on his [Mohamed\u2019s] motivation\u201d for going to Syria. There was also no evidence of any connection between Mohamed and Syria, O\u2019Connell said, such as family members living there. \u201cWe\u2019ve also not been provided with any emails or computer holdings that might be relied on in support of this charge,\u201d he said.

It takes their temperature.  Sibos, a gathering of financial experts being held in Boston this week, emailed attendees on Monday, before the disclosure of the first case of Ebola to be diagnosed in the US, to inform them that it would, in addition to its typical metal detectors, be employing \u201cthermal scanners\u201d at each entrance to the conference \u201cto detect elevated body temperatures and possible infectious diseases\u201d. The idea behind using these scanners, most models of which look like a smaller version of the radar guns police use to catch speeding motorists, is that they can detect people who have a fever, one of the symptoms of Ebola, as well as many other infectious agents.  This kind of screening has long been used as part of the response to outbreaks like Ebola, Sars and influenza. People flying out of the West African countries where the Ebola epidemic is currently centered have their temperatures taken before boarding, and if it is elevated, they are tested for the virus.  Whether doing this \u2013 and especially by way of these scanners \u2013 is effective is another matter. Some researchers have called the scanners reassuring, and not much more.  Checking body temperature isn\u2019t a sure-fire way to find individuals infected with Ebola. People can carry the virus for up to three weeks before showing symptoms, and are not contagious during that period. The patient in the US case, Thomas Eric Duncan, was reportedly asymptomatic when he travelled from Liberia to Dallas.  In a guidance paper produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for airport and public health officials, the agency lists what it sees as problems with the devices, including cost, lack of precision, need for frequent calibration and maintenance and training requirements. Testing efficacy to judge the scanners write large is difficult because of the many and changing models available.  While such scanners can be good at ruling out people without fevers, the CDC said, they have a wide and varying range of efficacy at finding people with fevers depending on environmental conditions and even the age of the person being scanned.

Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg\u2019s battle for the F1 title has been an enthralling contest, swinging to and fro with enough drama to assuage what might have become humdrum given the advantage Mercedes enjoy over the rest of the field. With five races to go it is the car that is crucial. With no one wanting the title to be decided by mechanical failures, reliability has become paramount. That Mercedes have crafted a superior car is to their credit but they are less pleased with its ability to make it to the chequered flag. Team and board are more than aware that had any of their competitors matched them this season, both titles might have been lost to breakdowns. Four races, two for each of the two drivers, have seen mechanical failures, with Hamilton suffering a further unwanted pair in qualifying. The most recent befell Rosberg, a wiring loom problem in the steering column at the last race in Singapore, that allowed Hamilton, who won, to move three points ahead in the championship. \u201cIt\u2019s reliability and it\u2019s happened again,\u201d Rosberg said in Singapore, acknowledging it had been the low point of his season. \u201cAs a team we really need to get to the bottom of it because it\u2019s happening to us too much.\u201d But here he was far more optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it is a little weakness for us, in the big picture we have done an awesome job this year. So we must not now see this as a big problem for us as a team. It\u2019s a problem we have, but the big picture is absolutely spectacular. \u201cI\u2019m not worrying about reliability. I have this inner trust that the team is going to get the job done. I\u2019m very confident.\u201d Inevitably this is part personal psychology and entirely correct. He must, as a driver, move on from problems. That he has done so should be expected; he is an intelligent and thoughtful competitor always looking to prise the most from any situation as he has proved repeatedly this season, not least nursing his brakes home to take a superb second place in Canada. He needs to think positively now more than ever given the travails \u2013 a team admonishment, booing from fans and being soundly beaten by Hamilton at Monza \u2013 that he has suffered since taking out the British driver at Spa. Unsurprising then, but not in itself any guarantee gremlins will not affect either driver again in their run-in for the title, and it is an issue that has been acknowledged by the Mercedes executive Toto Wolff. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have the spin in there that the championship was decided because one car let the driver down,\u201d he said after Singapore. Wolff instigated a reliability working group last year to prevent these problems and is surprised they still occur: \u201cIt is even more astonishing we keep having those issues. They need to get a grip but this takes time.\u201d Hamilton was also eager to focus on the positives he could take from the car troubles. \u201cYou don\u2019t focus on the past but you don\u2019t forget about it,\u201d he said. \u201cParticularly this year, [with] those experiences I have had, I know this weekend will be a tough weekend, the next five could all be tough weekends, there are all the possibilities in the world I could be facing the toughest time of my life \u2013 but it is also possible it could be the greatest time of my life.\u201d Both drivers will wholeheartedly believe these next five races will prove to be the latter, but for Wolff, who suffered fractures in a cycling accident in July, the business of the day is ensuring both his cars make the finish. \u201cI would break my arm again to stop the reliability issues,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just have to get on top of the problems.\u201d Problems that may yet be moot in Japan. Heavy rain for a large part of the day, which did not dampen the fervour of hundreds of Japanese fans who, as always, sat in the grandstand opposite the pits even though there were no cars running, may be a foretaste of typhoon Phanfone, which is predicted to arrive on Monday. Should it strike early and cause the grand prix to be abandoned, there is little chance to reschedule. In 2004 and 2010, typhoon Ma-on and heavy rain caused qualifying to be shifted to Sunday morning but with a back-to-back race in Russia next weekend there is little leeway, leaving Hamilton and Rosberg only four races to settle their title fight."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/02/andy-murray-china-open-pablo-cuevas", "sentences": ["The two-times champion Kuznetsova dropped the first set but prevailed 2-6, 6-4, 6-3 in battle that complicates her German opponent\u2019s hopes of qualifying for the season-ending WTA Finals in Singapore.", "The second seed Simona Halep, one of four players to have already secured a place in the Singapore event, battled past Andrea Petkovic of Germany with tie-breaks separating the pair in two of the three low-quality sets."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-02T17:01:00Z", "title": "Andy Murray beats Pablo Cuevas to advance to China Open quarter-finals", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Sport", "Tennis"], "article": "Andy Murray strolled into the quarter-finals of the China Open on Thursday with a straightforward victory over Pablo Cuevas.

Willie Walsh, chief executive of International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways, said Britain\u2019s political class lacks the character required to push through a policy as controversial as a third Heathrow runway. \u201cHistorically, politicians have not been brave enough and I don\u2019t think they will be brave enough going forward. You need a big shift in the politics of the country,\u201d he said. However, Walsh warned a Conservative or Labour-led government against choosing Gatwick for an extra runway, adding that the case for growing the capital\u2019s second-largest airport is \u201csignificantly weaker.\u201d He said: \u201cThe airport does have capacity. You could make a case to build a second runway. The case is significantly weaker \u2013 and I don\u2019t care what scale you want to use \u2013 than the case you can make to expand Heathrow.\u201d He added that Gatwick did not have the same international attraction. \u201cYou won\u2019t find many airlines that say \u2018God I\u2019d love to be able to fly to Gatwick\u2019. That\u2019s why this isn\u2019t a business issue, an economic argument. It\u2019s a political argument and the politics of expanding Heathrow are significantly more difficult than the politics of expanding Gatwick.\u201d Walsh also warned about uncertainty caused by the Conservative \u201cfixation\u201d with Europe and the promise of an in-out referendum. \u201cThe UK pulling out of the EU would be a blow to business, certainly. Withdrawing would be a mistake for the UK. When I travel around the world, people ask me \u2013 the UK isn\u2019t going to pull out of Europe, surely? I think there is great surprise outside when people look at the debate that\u2019s going on within the UK.\u201d British Airways will continue to look to expand in Asia, including a return to Kuala Lumpur in May 2015, and will look at other routes as more of its 787 Dreamliners on order are delivered. But Walsh admitted that its expansion in China had been slow. He said the latest Chinese route to the growing city of Chengdu, launched in late 2013, had disappointed and was slower to develop than hoped. \u201cIn terms of passenger demand, we are struggling as a result of Chinese visas. That\u2019s a perfect example of where UK government policy is working against the UK interests of developing more business with China.\u201d Walsh also claimed that Sir Richard Branson has handed over control of his Virgin Atlantic airline to its \u201cmore rational\u201d American minority partner Delta Air Lines. A 49% stake in Virgin owned by Singapore Airlines was sold last year to Delta. Virgin and Delta have since confirmed a transatlantic partnership and codeshare on routes from Heathrow to the US. Branson\u2019s carrier has meanwhile rowed back from a range of destinations around the world, announcing withdrawals from Mumbai, Tokyo and Nairobi. Walsh said: \u201cVirgin is controlled by Delta. Decisions are taken in Atlanta by the Delta management team who are one of the best in the business. They are much more rational in terms of their behaviour.\u201d He added: \u201cVirgin has almost disappeared... Delta control Virgin, without any doubt, without any question. We just call it Delta now. \u201c Walsh said that he believed foreign ownership rules, which prevent non-European companies from running EU airlines, should be scrapped, but said he expected them to be applied to Delta. He said: \u201cYou could argue that if the rules are there they should be applied. The US is stronger on this... Europe is weak. Europe has lots of rules that they don\u2019t necessarily abide by.\u201d A spokesman for Virgin said: \u201cWe agree Delta are the best airline partner in the marketplace and are glad Willie Walsh feels the same. We\u2019ve clearly rattled his cage by how strong a competitor we now are on the US route.\u201d Walsh took a further swipe at his rival, whose domestic service to Scotland and Manchester from Heathrow, Little Red, has been operating with a large proportion of empty seats. Its Heathrow slots, owned by BA, were awarded to Virgin by competition authorities after BA bought BMI from Lufthansa. Walsh said: \u201cIt\u2019s looking terrible. The fact is that they are struggling \u2013 you cannot make money flying planes that are less than half-full. I said it would be a mistake and am delighted to be proven correct.\u201d Walsh was speaking on the first flight from London to Washington of BA\u2019s A380 aircraft, the first time the two nations\u2019 capitals have been connected by the two superjumbos. BA has now received 7 of the 12 doubledecker Airbus aircraft, which can carry up to 469 passengers. Walsh said the plane was a \u201cbeautiful machine\u201d for Heathrow. \u201cThe business case for the A380 was based on high-volume routes when frequency was not in a critical issue in a slot constrained airport like Heathrow, and it\u2019s absolutely perfect in that environment.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/03/lewis-hamilton-title-nico-rosberg-formula-one", "sentences": ["Hamilton has been in a dramatic battle with Rosberg since the season began and now, after a win in Singapore where his rival failed to finish, he leads the title fight by three points, only the second time he has done so since going ahead after the Spanish Grand Prix."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-03T21:30:05Z", "title": "Lewis Hamilton: title fight with Nico Rosberg is good for Formula One", "tags": ["Lewis Hamilton", "Nico Rosberg", "Mercedes GP", "Formula One 2014", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Lewis Hamilton believes his battle for the world championship with Nico Rosberg is good for Formula One despite the pair\u2019s dominance this season, and has said he is no longer troubled by the reliability problems that have stymied his title bid thus far.

Hamilton has been in a dramatic battle with Rosberg since the season began and now, after a win in Singapore where his rival failed to finish, he leads the title fight by three points, only the second time he has done so since going ahead after the Spanish Grand Prix. It was at Suzuka that Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna had two of their most famous coming togethers, in 1989 and 1990, and as he resumes his own title fight at the same circuit Hamilton felt compelled to recall that great rivalry. \u201cIt was epic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a cool period of time in Formula One.\u201d \u201cWe need more of them [battles], I think.

It is Hamilton, however, who has been hit the harder, with two race failures and two in qualifying. But he insisted yesterday that he does not dwell on such events and accepts they could recur in the final five races of the season. \u201cI come in knowing anything can happen, because I\u2019ve been through these experiences before,\u201d the 29-year-old said. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything negative to happen but I feel hopefully positive that it won\u2019t be the be all and end all. \u201cThe team are working very hard on reliability. You\u2019ve got to remember, this team came from not having much speed, so they\u2019ve not had to work on reliability they\u2019ve had to work on being fast. And now all of a sudden they are fast and they\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019ve got the foundation of reliability behind them. It\u2019s not something we can just do in a couple of weeks.\u201d All has gone well for both drivers in Suzuka, and it was honours even across the pair after practice on Friday. Hamilton topped the second session just over two-tenths clear of his rival, with Rosberg ahead by just over a tenth in the morning run. Both sessions took place in dry, sunny conditions, which are not expected for qualifying on Saturday or race day. Typhoon Phanfone may not strike at race time \u2013 the Formula One weather forecaster UBIMET stated on Friday that the \u201ccentre of the typhoon will pass close by on Monday morning with widespread transport disruption, structural damage and possible injuries\u201d \u2013 but the associated weather systems are still expected to bring very heavy rain to the track on Sunday. The race cannot be postponed with a back-to-back trip to Russia scheduled and equipment needing to be shipped out, and bringing it forward to Saturday has been rejected.

You may have never owned anything produced by Apple. You may not even be on the internet. But if you want enough money in retirement, you had better hope Apple shifts zillions of the things. One of the extraordinary facts to have emerged in our review of auto-enrolment \u2013 two years old this week \u2013 is where the money is going. Millions of people, often on relatively low incomes, are for the first time saving into a pension. Millions more will join them over the next few years as the scheme is forced on to almost every employer in the country, no matter how small. The \u201cdefault\u201d fund that employers can use in order to comply with the rules is called Nest (National Employment Savings Trust). So what is it buying on your behalf to secure your future? It turns out that shares in iPhone maker Apple are easily the biggest holding. After that, it\u2019s oil company Exxon Mobil, Google and Microsoft. Only one British company creeps into the top 10 holdings, and even then it\u2019s only part British: Royal Dutch Shell. The rest are American, with the exception of Nestl\u00e9, a Swiss company. Just 8.5% of the shares in Nest are UK companies, and only a further 17.4% are even European. The lion\u2019s share \u2013 nearly 55% \u2013 are in North America. It\u2019s not that the managers at Nest have decided to blow our futures on a gamble that Apple and Google are still going to be around in 40 years time (anyone remember ITT?); instead this is just a fact of \u201cindexation\u201d. Nest and other similar pension fund managers put the money into index funds that replicate global stock markets \u2013 and Apple is the world\u2019s biggest company by market capitalisation, worth around half a trillion dollars. Indexation keeps charges low \u2013 Nest is fantastically cheap. There are lots of good reasons to spread your investments over a diversified range of international companies, which Nest is doing. What\u2019s more, in achieving returns of 10%-plus a year since launch, it hasn\u2019t had to face too many awkward questions. But if interest rates rise, the fund will have a much bumpier ride. It is surprising just how much of the fund is in government and corporate bonds (around 35%) which are virtually guaranteed to fall if rates rise. Bonds have been a great investment over the past decade and a half, but many fear they are now in bubble territory. Make no mistake, Nest is going to be huge. It won\u2019t hit the size of the $900bn Norwegian oil fund, but as both the level of contributions is increased (from 2% of pay to 8% of pay by 2018) and more workers join, its assets are going to escalate fast. Conventional City of London ideology is informing its investment decisions. Yet in Singapore, the country\u2019s compulsory pension fund has been mobilised to held build local housing. Ottawa\u2019s pension fund is extraordinarily interventionist.

Williams put in a sterling performance with the upgrades they have brought here proving effective and putting them at the top of the pack chasing Mercedes with Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa in third and fourth. Bottas was sixth-tenths down on Hamilton and having run quickly in practice they look to be the class of the pack behind the top two.

He had exercised an escape clause in his contract that allowed him to leave should he be below third place in the championship. He is currently fifth and his difficult season was reflected here. He has an extremely impressive record at this testing, unforgiving circuit, with four poles and four wins in five visits, but could only edge through into Q3 in tenth and will start ninth on the grid on Sunday, out-qualified for the ninth time this season by his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who took sixth spot and will now be the senior driver at Red Bull next year.

Mike Booker, international director at totaljobs.com, said: \u201cThis report cements London\u2019s reputation as a truly global city. Not only does it offer a wealth of job opportunities in a range of industries, but it boasts some of the world\u2019s top cultural attractions, so it\u2019s no surprise that people across the globe want to come and work here.\u201d He noted that both London and New York already have a high population of foreign-born workers, about 3 million in each city. But while seven US cities are in the top 40 most desirable cities for work, no other UK cities feature. Booker said: \u201cIf people want to move to the UK, they want to move to London.\u201d Booker highlighted the prominence of the finance industry as well as high salary prospects, public healthcare and cultural diversity. Ali Aslan G\u00fcm\u00fcs, a 45-year-old Turkish jobseeker, said: \u201cIf you ask a young person in this country, \u2018Where do you want to go in the UK?\u2019. They\u2019ll never say Liverpool or Manchester. They all say London because of the cultural harmonisation.\u201d Booker said about Paris: \u201cIt really comes down to the cultural element. Economically and politically and from a level of recruitment, things really are tough there, but it has global appeal.\u201d The UK is the second most-appealing country for international jobseekers after the US, with 37% saying they want to work in the UK, against 42% for the US. The UK is particularly popular among people in Portugal, Israel, Barbados, Romania and Jamaica. Canada is the third most desirable country (35%) overall, while Germany, Switzerland and France are the favourite non-English-speaking countries that people would relocate to. The survey found 44% of Brits want to move abroad for work. The French and the Dutch were most willing to up sticks among Europeans, with more than 90% desiring. a job abroad Overall, the survey found that almost two in three jobseekers worldwide (64%) are willing to move abroad for work, led by engineers and those working in technical jobs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/oct/06/ligue-1-ffp-stifle-import-top-players-psg-monaco-football", "sentences": ["In Asia all the very dynamic markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, Australia to a certain extent, had amazingly strong bonds with England."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-06T21:53:29Z", "title": "Ligue 1 hopes FFP won\u2019t stifle import of top players to PSG and Monaco | Nick Ames", "tags": ["Ligue 1", "Financial fair play", "Paris Saint-Germain", "Monaco", "European club football", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "It was not the worst mistake of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s draw with Monaco but it displayed the most glaring lack of coordination and thus drew the loudest howls. Edinson Cavani had been sent through by Thiago Motta \u2013 the latter making a rare burst towards the penalty area as space opened up early in the second half \u2013 and had a clear shot at Danijel Subasic from the inside-left position. Should score? It was his weaker side, but arguably. Should make the keeper work? Definitely. Instead Cavani, his bearings all wrong, kicked fresh air as limbs travelled at 90 degrees to the ball, which eventually went out for a corner. It darkened the pall of gloom developing around his time at Parc des Princes and \u2013 in a match where skirmishes inside either penalty area were uniformly scrappy \u2013 fitted the evening\u2019s own narrative well enough. Cavani\u2019s miss brought to mind a conversation between Mathieu Ficot, chief commercial officer of France\u2019s Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) and a group of English journalists a couple of days previously. The French league\u2019s need for star names was a recurring theme and Ficot was musing, unprompted, about the kind of player that could raise \u2013 and already has raised \u2013 its profile. \u201cCavani, I still don\u2019t know if we can qualify him as a football star,\u201d he said. \u201c[Zlatan] Ibrahimovic is a football star, [David] Luiz, [Radamel] Falcao and now James [Rodr\u00edguez] since the World Cup \u2013 we need this kind of guy to attract curiosity and interest from all around the world.\u201d If it seems hard on Cavani, the outstanding Uruguay striker whose apparently unsatisfactory 15 months in Paris have brought 29 goals in 51 appearances, it speaks more of a concern in France about Ligue 1\u2019s ability to follow up on the engagement and publicity generated by PSG and Monaco\u2019s new-found wealth and relative success. One does not have to read far between the lines to conclude that the sight of Cavani\u2019s athletic but sometimes unsubtle frame leading the line for Laurent Blanc\u2019s team is considered insufficient to make the division\u2019s appeal stick. The departures of Falcao and Rodr\u00edguez from Monaco, largely brought on by a change of direction from the owner, Dmitry Rybolovlev, in face of Financial Fair Play regulations, posed an unwelcome reminder that it has just become more difficult than ever to build and resource a European superpower from a position of anything other than existing strength. On the pitch Ibrahimovic\u2019s absence through injury seemed a contributing factor to a lack of intensity in the atmosphere between France\u2019s two new heavyweights. It was a match that had captured Europe\u2019s imagination a year ago but now, with neither side having started well in the league and big names either injured or sold on, it presented little more than an added item of interest in a crowded weekend. It goes to show that some cake is required beneath the icing but Ficot explained there are much wider battles to fight to create a product of sustainable global draw to match those of England and Spain. \u201cAs far as language and history are concerned, the Premier League and La Liga have really benefited,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Spanish league is almost No1 in South America and is increasingly competitive in the US. The Premier League has many markets but \u2013 taking Africa as an example \u2013 all the richest countries on that continent are Anglophone; the Francophone countries are the poorest. In Asia all the very dynamic markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, Australia to a certain extent, had amazingly strong bonds with England.     Zlatan Ibrahimovic of PSG, left, is seen as the kind of acquisition French sides need to make to attract interest on a global level. Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images    \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t have assets of this kind. We are not used to being open to the world. I\u2019m not sure we are the most competitive actors on the market. When it comes to diplomacy and soft power we are there but our industry and communications aren\u2019t really.\u201d It is why Financial Fair Play, which has pressed the \u201coff\u201d switch on Monaco\u2019s spending for now (although the impact on PSG, whose Qatari ownership may have more strings to its bow than Rybolovlev\u2019s individual fortune, is less clear), comes at a particularly inopportune time for French football, with existing strongholds abroad operating from positions of historical advantage and Ligue 1 in danger of seeing its new-found glittering image peeled back. \u201cIt\u2019s a very tricky moment with FFP \u2013 a tricky topic,\u201d continued Ficot. \u201cOf course we will officially support it, because that creates a virtuous cycle. But remember that the Premier League benefited years ago from massive investment; you need that to be successful in the short term; otherwise it takes a very long time. \u201cWhen Lyon dominated Ligue 1 in the 2000s it didn\u2019t need the means required now to be successful at European level. But we all know, more or less, the name of the Champions League quarter-finalists now and the trend is that it will probably be the same teams over and over.\u201d Monaco\u2019s vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, spoke similarly before Sunday\u2019s game: \u201cIt\u2019s evident that it is much easier for well-established clubs with strong revenues to maintain their leading positions and in today\u2019s context it\u2019s almost impossible to develop a project such as Chelsea, at the time, or PSG and Manchester City recently,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s for the good of European football I\u2019m not the one to judge but this is definitely one of the effects. \u201cBut these are the rules, we respect them and we are cooperating with Uefa to comply with them. However, I do think there will be an evolution of FFP to take into account the large diversity of countries and clubs for the benefit of European football.\u201d For the moment Monaco continue along a new, academy-based strategy that is unlikely to be a quick win commercially even if the club insist vehemently that they are not going away. It puts added pressure on the wider Ligue 1 product, although the disparity between its regular Champions League qualifiers and the rest in today\u2019s market is clear: PSG received more than \u20ac55m for their run to last season\u2019s quarter-finals; clubs in Ligue 1 that have not qualified for Europe \u2013 14 in number this season \u2013 shared \u20ac10m in Uefa \u201csolidarity payments\u201d. The start made by Marseille \u2013 they sit five points clear of second-placed Bordeaux, seven ahead of PSG and 11 up from Monaco \u2013 is therefore a welcome tonic. They were the beneficiaries of around \u20ac30m of their owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s money during the summer and Ficot \u2013 who more than once alluded to France\u2019s 75% high-earner\u2019s tax as another major inhibiting factor \u2013 lives in hope that others may see similar investment. \u201cI really hope that some investors will one day look at France a little bit differently and that we build a strong product,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that one of our assets is the number of teams that could be competitive in France, in comparison with other leagues. Maybe we have a balanced league with more suspense.\u201d In the meantime big performances will do no harm in mitigating any big-name drain. PSG\u2019s win over Barcelona last week was a reminder that Ligue 1 has, regardless of any uncertainty, come a long way. \u201cWe need football stars and we need great European performances,\u201d said Ficot. \u201cI think it\u2019s a kind of prestige victory that gives a highlight to PSG and French football in general.\u201d PSG walk out at Camp Nou in December. Were Cavani to keep his feet and score there it would brighten his club\u2019s star, that of his league and, perhaps, even his own.

According to a newly released report by Traffic, an international watchdog group that monitors the wildlife trade, the rare pig-nosed turtle is under dire threat from exotic pet enthusiasts. According to Serene Chng, programme officer at Traffic\u2019s Kuala Lumpur office, the reptile is in high demand from pet traders - including online traders - in Europe, the United States and Asia. It can be found only regionally in Australia and Papua and is categorized as \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  The pig-nosed turtle - named for its porcine snout \u2013 is especially appealing to pet traders because of its \u201cuniqueness\u201d, explains Chng: \u201cThey are the only surviving species of the family they are in. They come from a restricted range, so it is very exotic to own [them]. And the hatchlings are very attractive and very cute.\u201d The species can grow up to 50 lbs and two feet in length over the course of its 40-year lifespan.          Sir David Attenborough tells us that the pig-nosed turtle is descended from land-living ancestors and uses its distinctive snout to breathe air    The new report on the state of the species finds that within a 10-year period (2003-2013), 80,000 pig-nosed turtles were confiscated in some 30 seizures, including a massive bust of 8,368 turtles in an array of suitcases in Papua and Jakarta, Indonesia, last January. \u201cChances are there is a lot more illegal trade happening that isn\u2019t being reported or caught,\u201d Chng says. The illegal animal trade constitutes an estimated $10bn global industry, according to the Humane Society. Numbers on the illicit exotic pet trade are hard to come by, but Peter Paul van Dijk, director of Conservation International\u2019s turtle conservation program, speculates that it\u2019s roughly $1bn annually - and growing. And although turtles have been a mainstay of illegal trade for at least 20 years, the turtle trade is \u201cquietly growing in the US,\u201d according to van Dijk. \u201cThere is greater demand and an increased opportunity to buy turtles in pet stores\u201d, he says. China has one of the biggest thirsts on the globe for pet turtles, says Ross Kiester, Chief Scientist at the Turtle Conservancy. \u201cThe pet trade is definitely increasing and you see that as the Asian countries become more wealthy. 20 years ago in China, no one could afford turtles as a pet - and now everyone can.\u201d According to Chng, millions of turtles and tortoises are being shuttled around the globe annually for the pet trade. She says there\u2019s an accelerating trend of exporting turtles by packing them into checked luggage on international passenger airlines. Smuggled animals are usually babies because of their smaller, more transportable size. Nearly 20% of turtles die while being smuggled.  According to the report, Papuan villagers are plucking upwards of 2m pig-nosed turtle eggs from their riverside nests annually. Because hatchlings tend to bring more money than the turtle eggs, some Papuan collectors and \u201cimmigrant traders\u201d incubate [the turtles] in hatcheries. Hatchlings can sell on the international market for $39-$56 each. This wasn\u2019t always the case. Papuans once hunted the eggs solely for food, in numbers that were more sustainable. But the high market prices have made the turtle much more valuable as a commodity than a food source. Furthermore, turtle traders are enticing Papuan communities with expensive turtle-hunting gear, like motorboats.  The pig-nosed are one of a number of turtles that are in danger because of their exotic attributes. Other sought-after species include the Indian star tortoise, the black spotted turtle, the radiated tortoise and the ploughshare tortoise.  The vast, illegal trade in wildlife operates for a number of reasons. It begins with a basic lack of oversight and regulation, \u201cmeaning no one is watching it or there is corruption going on or papers are being forged\u201d, Chng explains. Some animals, such as the pig-nosed turtle, aren\u2019t supposed to be traded if they are collected from the wild. But often, a trader will say that an animal is \u201ccaptive bred\u201d, meaning its parents were born in captivity as well. The problem is that the traders sometimes lie. So what\u2019s a conscientious consumer to do? \u201cAsk for permits,\u201d Chng says. \u201cIf it\u2019s legally traded, the pet shop should have permits for the import of the species.\u201d Still, even if proper documentation is provided, it doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t consequences. \u201cFor every turtle that they buy at the pet shop,\u201d Chng says, \u201cthere are many dead turtles along the way.\u201d To avoid the extinction of the species, Chris Shepherd, regional director of Traffic in Southeast Asia, is calling for \u201curgent enforcement action in Papua\u201d. Governments must increase the number of inspectors along the international points of trade chain in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, mainland China and Hong Kong, he says. Shepherd also advocates for international public awareness campaigns and \u201cefforts to address socio-economic issues that drive the illegal trade in this distinctive but imperiled species\u201d.

($37.1m). (That record only stands without calculating for inflation. Panic Room\u2019s $30m, in 2002, would be worth $39m.) Topping the global chart is no mean feat for what is ultimately a specialty flick (Fox have been using films such as Captain Phillips, Argo and The Departed as yardsticks). Compared to the director\u2019s 2011 film Girl With the Dragon Tattoo \u2013 also drawn from a popular potboiler, but hobbled by an awkward, staggered Christmas roll-out \u2013 the studio opted to break Gone Girl big in 40 markets right out of the gate. It has done best in markets where the source novel sold well and the post-austerity emotional malaise that fills it has most resonance. So, again: Fincher bests in the UK ($6.9m) and Australia ($4.6m), and further significant No 1s in Russia ($2.95m) and Germany ($2.85m). But with thinner grosses further afield, and not many more major territories to come, you wonder if Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike\u2019s marital woes can go the distance. Dragon Tattoo\u2019s global tally ($232m) should be doable (and Gone Girl cost $30m less); achieving Benjamin Button\u2019s ($333.9m) might be stretching it.           Gone Girl star Ben Affleck: \u2018Usually the protagonist is full of shit\u2019 - video interview    The runner-up Critics seem to agree that John R Leonetti\u2019s possessed-doll chiller Annabelle largely lacks the fear factor of its parent film, 2013\u2019s The Conjuring. It opened slightly under the previous film ($41.9m) in the US, but it\u2019s still the sixth-highest horror debut, and a bounce for a genre that, apart from The Conjuring, hasn\u2019t seen a $100m+ global hit since 2013\u2019s Mama. There\u2019s little doubt it will be a steady little earner for distributor Warner Bros, firming up the franchise in preparation for a Conjuring sequel proper next October. Horror always translates well across different cultures, and many half-decent films with enough marketing oomph seem able to uncork primal urges and decent financial returns at the same time. Annabelle, in 15 fewer territories, has pulled in only $4m less than Gone Girl, with historic performances in some places. It had five No1s in Asia, with record horror debuts in Malaysia ($2.4m) and Singapore ($1m), as well as a strong take in Korea ($3m); perhaps Catholic-tinged satanic panic has as much exotic appeal over there as their lank-haired girl ghosts do here.  Made in China            Easily the biggest overseas gross of the weekend ($38m) was for Ning Hao\u2019s divorce road-trip comedy Breakup Buddies. Most of that was the mighty Chinese domestic haul, neck and neck with the US openings for Gone Girl and Annabelle \u2013 more proof of how that country is increasingly closing the gap with America. That takes its running total to $93m, having opened mid-week on 30 September as the flagship release ushering in China\u2019s Golden Week holiday. Comedy stars Huang Bo and Xu Zheng \u2013 playing a washed-up singer and his best friend on the pull from Beijing to the south-western city of Dali \u2013 are reigniting their schtick from 2012 indie smash Lost in Thailand. With Ning directing (he\u2019s had a string of local hits, often starring Huang), it\u2019s a true A-list confab. And audiences bit hard: its opening day ($15.9m) more than doubled Lost in Thailand\u2019s ($6.25m), a sleeper hit that wound up China\u2019s most successful local film. Breakup Buddies looks a good bet to top its eventual $208m. If you still think the story is just provincial chatter, then \u2013 in contrast with LIT\u2019s afterthought US release \u2013 the followup opened simultaneously in Australia, New Zealand and the US, with a punchy $240,000 on 20 screens in the latter. The day Sino-blockbusters are routine exports may not be far off. The God squad     No faith in the south for Nicolas Cage in Left Behind Photograph: PR    The Lord smileth not on Nicolas Cage, at the box office at least. His $16m-budgeted end-times thriller Left Behind was bidding to become the fourth sizeable fundamentalist-Christian hit of 2014. A disappointing $6.9m opening leaves it quite a way off the pace set by Fox\u2019s Son of God in February ($15.9m), the independently produced high-school drama God\u2019s Not Dead in March ($9.2m) and Sony\u2019s Heaven Is for Real ($22.5m). Maybe Cage\u2019s star chops and messianic propensities can help close the gap overseas; some of the above found followers in Latin America, especially (though Left Behind has a rather optimistic Middle East-centric release schedule). But all four films taken as a trend, the Bible-belt is clearly no longer regarded by the film industry as a desert only touchable by acts of God like Mel Gibson\u2019s Passion of the Christ. The rest of the world            Plenty of foreign flotsam flooded the global chart this week. Though, typically, half of it was just Hollywood in disguise. Bang Bang!, Fox Star\u2019s reworking of the 2010 Tom Cruise-Cameron Diaz vehicle Knight and Day, swept off with the No 1 spot in that country and No 6 globally. It\u2019s a boon for leading man Hrithik Roshan, who underwent brain surgery after an accident on the set, and a massive result for Fox\u2019s Indian arm, its first palpable hit on the subcontinent; perhaps the Bollywood monopoly is breachable after all. Fox\u2019s all-purpose local-film unit, FIP, was also busy in South Korea, where its comedy Slow Video ($5.2m) pipped stem-cell-research drama Whistle Blower ($4.9m) to the top rung (and 16th spot globally). Another Golden Week release in China, Taiwanese cop-thriller sequel Black &amp; White: The Dawn of Justice looks to have built on its TV fanbase and 3D tart-up, passing its predecessor\u2019s $14.9m lifetime take in a single week. And, in 16th place globally, the fifth in one-man-band Santiago Segura\u2019s Torrente series \u2013 about a balding, bigoted, Franco-loving Madrid cop \u2013 became Spain\u2019s biggest opening of the year so far.

This is the spring season\u2019s festival of silk, an annual ritual where barristers seek special indulgences in the form of appointment as senior counsel or Queen\u2019s counsel.  It\u2019s as important to barristers \u2013 that thin slice of the legal profession specialising in advocacy and advice and who wear a special costume from the Queen Anne era \u2013 as sacrifices were to the Mayans.  NSW has just unveiled 18 new senior counsel, out of a list of 102 applicants. Three of the new ones are women. Queensland has Queen\u2019s counsel, courtesy of the monarchist attorney general Jarrod Bleijie, and a fresh crop of silk gowns will be announced by Melbourne Cup week. The traditional bows ceremony is held at a hugely popular event known as the exchange of Christmas insults.  In Victoria, the fresh crop will be made public on the last Tuesday of November. Somehow the Victorian government was persuaded by the local bar council early this year to allow those appointed to upgrade their senior council scrolls to letters patent - ie Queen\u2019s council.  Unsurprisingly, George Brandis has signed-onto the monarchical tendency and from now on the Commonwealth will be appointing QCs.  With Queensland, Victoria and the Commonwealth opting for the royalist bar bauble there has been agitation, to varying degrees, to do the same in most of the other states and territories.  It\u2019s a significant mish mash and in its own revealing way shows a nation of 23 million people without a cohesively organised legal profession. Even stranger, it exposes that Australian tendency to desperate insecurity, which can only be cured by blessings and baubles from the motherland. From 1993 onwards, the states and territories began phasing out the appointment of QCs and replacing them with SCs. After all, this is what they were \u2013 even in the fanciest flight of imagination, they were not counsel to the Queen at all.  Now the rush is on to re-establish the royalist flourish. In the legal business it\u2019s about status, self-esteem and money and it accompanies the reemergence of Dames and Sirs in Tony Abbott\u2019s firmament of the steadfast \u00a310 Pom.  One of the unsettling aspects of the appointment of SCs and QCs is that they are heralded by the various associations of barristers as the finest fleece in the flock, who can deliver guaranteed brilliance. It leaves you wondering about the other 80% of barristers who are not badged in this way. What has happened to their skills and brilliance? The whole thing does seem a mighty unfair piece of workplace discrimination. There are some barristers who are at the top of their game, with busy practices and able to charge fat fees, yet have not taken silk. Maybe they haven\u2019t applied, maybe they are outside the club and the unspoken system of nods and winks.  In a free enterprise economy, as advocated by governments throughout the land, it does seem odd for the market to be distorted by glorified badges of excellence awarded under special club rules that don\u2019t adequately explain the grounds for exclusion.  Yet, here we are: stuck with a 400-year-old Elizabethan ornamentation.  The NSW bar council has commissioned reports into whether the royalist gong should be restored and has decided against. In the premier state, to convert from SCs to QCs would require an amendment to the Legal Profession Act, which currently prohibits official schemes for recognition of seniority and status.  The NSW attorney general, Brad Hazzard, has said his \u201cinstinctive response is that debate has been had. It\u2019s over. Let\u2019s move forward\u201d. So, it does seem that a small but vocal faction of barristers will just have endure life without monarchical adornments.  This has brought on a subterranean attack from within the Victorian bar, that the NSW system of silk appointments lacks impartiality, because the elevations are made by a committee of wise elders from within the guild.  In response, it is pointed out that Queen\u2019s counsel are in reality government appointees, because they have to be approved by the executive council. For the government to be ticking off the silk list smudges the gloss on the bars\u2019 marketing position - that is is entirely independent.  One of the cases mounted in favour of QCs is that the top English barristers with letters patent tattooed on their foreheads are stealing the plum work in Hong Kong and Singapore, because litigating merchants and financiers like the idea of having someone blessed by Her Maj on their team.  Leading Sydney SC Bret Walker has gone on the record to say that the argument to restore QCs has \u201cnothing to do with the public interest\u201d. He thinks that the argument that QCs could win more work than SCs in Asia, \u201cattributes to those unnamed, and probably fictitious foreign personages, a kind of snobbery that might be rather closer to home\u201d. There, it\u2019s out in the open \u2013 snobbery. Another Sydney SC, Bruce McClintock, put it bluntly - the Queen\u2019s counsel title is, \u201cdishonest ... In what sense are QCs ... counsel of, to or for Elizabeth II\u201d? This gallivanting back to the distant bosom, 15,000km away, does not bespeak well of a supposedly independent, progressive, modern, sovereign nation at the foot of Asia. In fact, it is positively cringeworthy.

Above all, at that date Florence was a polity in which the majority of its citizens could participate \u2013 Medici rule was yet to come. This was the classic city-state: a place which shaped itself. Today, Singapore and Hong Kong are the two city-states which come immediately to mind. They are very different \u2013 Singapore seeming much more in the classic mode of self-control; Hong Kong a city which did keep a certain degree of autonomy even during colonial terms, but is struggling to hold on to it today. If we look away from politics, even these two are not city-states culturally, at least of the kind our ancestors knew. When your plane lands in 2014, once you pass immigration, take a taxi to your hotel and go in search of something to eat, neither city seems so different from the Beijing, Delhi or Buenos Aires, New York or London you just left. Similarly, the business of big cities is globally converging and mutually contingent: cities shape each other. They are networked cities rather than independent city-states. Should we want to transform the networked city into a more locally oriented, self-contained city-state? Max Weber certainly thought so. The German sociologist, who lived before the age of networks but in an age of nationalist passions, thought that locally oriented cities dealing with practical issues on the ground were likely to resist the blandishments of nationalisms, or other -isms.     The iconic city-state of Hong Kong is currently wrestling with its autonomous traditions. Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP    Weber thought the city-state could be inclusive as a nation could not be, particularly in giving migrants who had crossed national borders standing as citizens with local rights. He called these \u201cplace-based\u201d rights. Weber represents a stream of thinking which emphasises the \u201cright to the city\u201d, in the phrase of the urbanist Henri Lefebvre; a right to be accounted and included in a specific and defined place. Were Weber or Lefebvre alive today, their critique of the networked city would be that only a few people enjoy rights within it. In contrast, the Algerian Franz Fanon celebrated the village and the farm as more truly autonomous than life in the city. He believed the autonomous city was from its origins a malign construct in the developing world; cities were the places in which the imperial powers first installed themselves, and even after de-colonisation, big cities like Algiers, Cairo, and Mumbai retained the top-down bureaucracies and political habits of rule of the colonial masters. In development work, Fanon\u2019s beliefs proved immensely influential as a kind of rural, revolutionary romanticism \u2013 until, that is, the great growth-spurt of cities in the last 30 years forced aid workers, foundations and development ministries to take seriously that the city has become a much bigger, and much different, beast than in colonialist times. What Weber and Fanon shared, though, is a belief in autonomy, in local self-control. Now, that belief in autonomy as a goal needs to be unset. New realities oblige us to think about the city in a different way. The most urgent of these, to my mind, is climate change. The perils of climate change cannot be addressed by thinking at the scale of urban self-shaping, as Weber wanted, or of local, inclusive democracy, such as Lefebvre believed in. And climate change has rendered Fanon\u2019s opposition of urban in favour of rural out of date.     New Yorkers living along the coast wanted to rebuild their homes after Hurricane Sandy rather than move away, but this strategy is not always sustainable. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images    Hurricane Sandy in New York was a sharp lesson to Americans about these dimensions of climate change. This supposedly once-in-a-century storm followed a similar event just the year before, the storm surge devastating much of the city\u2019s coastline and destroying much of its inland energy infrastructure. Afterwards, those who lived along the coast wanted to rebuild the places they had lived in rather than move away. This local sentiment was translated into expenses that local communities were willing to pay in order to erect storm walls and barriers. But scientific opinion, marshalled by programmes such as Rebuild by Design, has shown that this strategy is not sustainable, and has argued that some communities should be broken up, others abandoned, others reconfigured drastically. The International Organisation on Climate Change (IOCC) casts this difference as one between mitigation and adaptation. But politically, it is a conflict between the Weberian value placed on self-determination, and a policy which emphasises the need to work with natural forces beyond the control of debates and votes in a particular city. The rebuilding which attempts to push back the sea so that people can return to their homes is very much in the city-state mode, aiming to keep the city together; whereas the adaptation strategy aims to break up much of the city. Adapting to climate change, in other words, means that coherence of the city\u2019s form will alter, due to forces outside human control.     Victims of Hurricane Sandy embrace: \u2018Under nature\u2019s sway, the very idea of autonomy loses its meaning.\u2019 Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA    Nature is undemocratic. Voting and inclusion cannot change the facts on the ground about how the climate operates, of course, but the issue cuts deeper. Collective will is irrelevant to adaptation strategies. Under nature\u2019s sway, the very idea of autonomy loses its meaning. \u201cUnpredictable\u201d is the key word: there is certainly a water crisis coming, but we don\u2019t know the form it will take. Almost all models of climate change argue for non-linear changes, chance combinations, erratic consequences occurring in the coming decades. All this argues that rural and urban be seen together, as one disturbed ecology. The political problem is how to practise governance under these conditions. Like \u201cautonomy\u201d, the climatic crisis is rendering the word \u201ccontrol\u201d problematic. I\u2019m not a gloomy pessimist, but I think the seductive idea of a place controlling its own fortunes is out of date. The climate crisis obliges us to think about our fortunes in a different way. To adapt, the city can not longer cohere; we must meet the uncertainty of a physically unsettled world by thinking of the city as itself a more unstable place. This is the logic of what natural scientists call \u201copen systems\u201d. These are structures which model chance, or seemingly illogical change, or complex events which destabilise an equilibrium condition. When IOCC climatologists moved from strategies of mitigation to adaptation, they began using open-systems thinking to model turbulence and disruption in storm patterns, polar meltdown and rising sea levels. All these phenomena are erratic short-term, year on year, though the long-term effects are certain over the course of decades.     A guard watches over the US border with Mexico: movement across this border is an erratic, convulsive process. Photograph: John Moore/Getty Images    We should be thinking about the networks linking big cities in the same way. Specific patterns of migration are as unstable in the immediate term as changes in the natural environment; for example, movement across the Mexican-American border is an erratic, convulsive process year-on-year, though the cumulative effect is clear. So too is the economy of networked cities: financial flows are not smooth and linear, nor are investments in real estate or primary industry. Open-system analysis thinks about networks as trembling rather than placid connections \u2013 and because the connections are complex, they are peculiarly open to disruption. In everyday life, we want to be in control as much as possible. But we are moving into an era, particularly in our relations with the natural world, where the sphere of human self-control and autonomy is shrinking. As an open-systems theorist, this is why I want to argue against the impulse to privilege local urban law, and against Weber\u2019s belief in place-based rights. These are closed political fantasies, as though politics could make the city more self-sufficient. The laws we need will have to deal in some regions with rights to scarce water, in others we\u2019ll need strategies for abandoning parts of the city exposed to flooding, in yet other places we\u2019ll have to ration electricity because we now longer burn the coal to generate it. Now? A generation from now?   The one certain thing is that the longer we delay changing fixed habits, the worse the problems will be. The urban challenge we face is how to live more openly, in the sense of acknowledging and coping with disorder.

People travelling from the worst-affected countries \u2013 Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2013 will face a questionnaire about their recent travel history, who they have been in contact with and their onward travel arrangements. Medical staff will be deployed to check some travellers\u2019 body temperature to ascertain if they have fever, one of the early symptoms of the illness. Rail passengers arriving in Kent and London on the Eurostar from Paris and Brussels will also be screened. Cases have already been reported in Spain and the US, where Thomas Eric Duncan died on Thursday after flying in from Liberia with the disease. Washington has announced that travellers from the worst-hit countries will have their temperatures taken on arrival at five major airports in New York, Washington, Chicago and Atlanta. The UK border measures will be introduced \u201cin the coming days\u201d, Downing Street said, and the announcement came despite the British defence secretary, Michael Fallon, saying earlier on Thursday that airport screening was not in line with World Health Organisation advice that screening for fevers or temperature is better conducted in the exit country. The chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, cited \u201cconcern about the growing number of cases\u201d of the illness and recommended border checks to ensure \u201cpotential cases arriving in the UK are identified as quickly as possible\u201d. Public Health England staff will work alongside border officers. No 10 was unable to say whether the system would catch travellers from west Africa who had transferred planes in other cities. The apparent U-turn comes before a war game-style test of Britain\u2019s ability to cope with an outbreak being planned by the Department of Health this weekend. Doctors, the ambulance service, local authorities and the police will take part in the real-time simulation of Ebola cases at two or more hospitals to be selected in the north and south of England. No 10 said: \u201cAdvice from the chief medical officer today is that enhanced screening arrangements at the UK\u2019s main ports of entry for people travelling from the affected regions \u2013 Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2013 will offer an additional level of protection to the UK. \u201cThese measures will help to improve our ability to detect and isolate Ebola cases. However, it is important to stress that given the nature of this disease, no system could offer 100% protection from non-symptomatic cases.\u201d The Foreign Office was last night investigating reports that a Briton had died of suspected Ebola in Macedonia. Tests were being carried out but the man\u2019s colleague said he had not been in any country known to have Ebola outbreaks. A social services centre in Paris which was sealed off after four children recently arrived from Guinea showed symptoms of the illness, was later reopened after the French authorities said it was a false alarm. Pressure for airport screening grew yesterday when Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, which scrutinises border controls, called for tests \u201cto ensure that this deadly disease cannot take more lives\u201d. Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, also urged the government to consider passenger screening \u201cwithout delay\u201d. Davies said: \u201cRapid access to healthcare services by someone infected with Ebola is not only important for their health but also key to reducing the risk of transmission to others. These measures could include a further UK-based package of measures to identify and assess the health status of passengers arriving from the affected countries and to ensure that those individuals know what to do should they be taken ill whilst in the UK.\u201d Experts say airport screening may have limited effect. David Heymann, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who is also chairman of Public Health England, said there was a danger of creating a false sense of security . \u201cIt is not a failsafe method mainly because people cross [borders] while they are still in the incubation period and you don\u2019t know they are infected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most important response is better detection and rapid response. Borders cannot stop infectious diseases spreading. In Hong Kong and Singapore they set up thermal scanners during the Sars epidemic but I don\u2019t think they identified more than one case that way.\u201d Professor David Mabey, another physician specialising in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, warned passengers will lie about their travel history to avoid the inconvenience and so would be \u201ca waste of time\u201d. \u201cIf last week your aunt died of Ebola but you feel fine, are you going to be honest when you get to the airport and risk being detained?\u201d he said. Professor George Griffin, chairman of the advisory committee on dangerous pathogens, said screening just for body temperature was ineffectual and would have missed the case of the US death. Experts also moved to play down fears of a major UK outbreak. Peter Piot, a Belgian microbiologist who is part of the World Health Organisation\u2019s Ebola science group, said: \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about an outbreak in western Europe, in the UK, like we are seeing in west Africa.\u201d Heymann said British preparedness to cope with Ebola cases was \u201csuperb\u201d. \u201cThe government and the NHS has access to all clinicians so messages can get out to all of them at once and that means it is much easier to achieve uniformity than in private systems,\u201d he said. He added that the public health authorities in the UK has successfully stopped two outbreaks of the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome, a virus which, unlike Ebola, can be transmitted through the air."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/10/words-with-friends-new-mobile-game-zynga", "sentences": ["Zynga is currently testing a new game, Words on Tour, in countries including Ireland and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-10T10:54:41Z", "title": "Words With Friends mobile game gets revamped for its fifth birthday", "tags": ["Zynga", "Games", "Mobile", "Apps", "iPhone", "iPad", "Android", "Technology", "Digital media", "Media", "Mobile phones", "Smartphones", "Tablet computers"], "article": "Five years is an age in mobile gaming terms, so it\u2019s no surprise that relatively few of the smartphone games released in 2009 are still being played in 2014. That makes Words With Friends something of an oddity. It was launched by indie developer Newtoy, which was subsequently bought in 2010 for $53.3m by Zynga. Newtoy\u2019s founders Paul and David Bettner have since moved on, but their game remains one of the bright spots for its publisher as it looks for more success on mobile. Hence New Words With Friends, a completely new version of the game launched this week for iOS and Android, after a lengthy beta period in countries like Australia and Canada to gauge player feedback to its new features. The game itself remains the same: it\u2019s essentially Scrabble, with players able to have a number of matches on the go at once, taking turns as often as suits them and their opponent. Games can be over in half an hour, or stretched over days and even weeks. What\u2019s new is a Solo Play mode to play offline against an artificial opponent, to hone your skills and also kill time if friends are dragging their heels over their turns in the multiplayer matches. Also new: a Community Match feature that uses a Tinder-style swiping interface to accept or reject potential opponents from the wider Words With Friends community, browsing their photos and stats before deciding whether to request a match. That relies on another new feature \u2013 player profiles tracking stats like average word score and number of games completed \u2013 while there\u2019s also a dictionary to look up the words that you play. \u201cThis is a really big deal for us,\u201d Zynga\u2019s vice president of games, Jonathan Knight, told The Guardian ahead of the new game\u2019s release. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important title for Zynga, and this is the most significant update we\u2019ve ever made to the game.\u201d Who cares about an update to a five-year-old mobile game, though? Plenty of people, according to Zynga. The company isn\u2019t currently divulging how many players Words With Friends has, but Knight refers to an active community of \u201cmillions\u201d and highlights another stat: 55m matches in progress at any given point. There is external evidence of Words With Friends\u2019 longevity, at least up until last year. Facebook analytics service AppData claimed that the game had 14.9 million monthly active users in January 2012 across mobile and Facebook, but that had risen to 22.8m by April 2013. Zynga\u2019s number of players across all its games has been falling steadily over the last couple of years, but I suspect Words With Friends has weathered the passage of time better than a franchise like FarmVille. But this in itself brings risks when making changes to modernise a game such as Words With Friends: millions of players who\u2019ll make their displeasure known loudly if they think the changes have ruined the game they love. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a while with this title, rolling it out in countries such as Canada and Australia to give people time so we could engage with that community,\u201d said Knight. \u201cWe\u2019re happy in Australia that we\u2019ve got 4.5 out of five stars on the App Store with hundreds of reviews: we\u2019re seeing that validation in those countries.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s more than just a word game \u2013 it\u2019s a social app\u2019 Why has Words With Friends lasted five years? The fact that even an official Scrabble game didn\u2019t seem to dent its popularity suggests that the key is the game\u2019s community \u2013 not least the fact that lots of your Facebook friends were likely to be playing it \u2013 rather than particular gameplay intricacies. \u201cIt\u2019s the social connections. It\u2019s more than just a word game: it really is a social app, and a way to maintain meaningful relationships,\u201d agreed Knight. \u201cI\u2019ve got aunts in Pennsylvania playing, and I get all of my news from that part of the family through them. And we\u2019ve had people tell us they got married to people they met through the game too.\u201d That brings another challenge: how to make money from a game based on these kinds of personal relationships. On that score, it\u2019s interesting that while Word With Friends does use in-app purchases, in Knight\u2019s words it\u2019s \u201ca business largely driven by advertisements\u201d \u2013 more like a Facebook or Twitter than a Clash of Clans or Candy Crush Saga in that respect. Unsurprisingly, Knight thinks Words With Friends will still be going strong in five years\u2019 time \u2013 he could hardly say otherwise, after all. \u201cI firmly believe it\u2019s got a long future ahead of it. It\u2019s fundamentally like card games or chess or backgammon, which are played together as families,\u201d he said. \u201cNew generations of players will come in, so this is a really evergreen title. And for us, there is a large audience of Words players out there, and we see more opportunities to bring word games to our audience.\u201d This is an interesting change in strategy. Since Zynga bought Newtoy, its expansion efforts focused on the \u201cWith Friends\u201d brand, with games including Matching With Friends, Running With Friends and Hanging With Friends. Now, it\u2019s focusing more on the \u201cWords\u201d part of the original game\u2019s title. Zynga is currently testing a new game, Words on Tour, in countries including Ireland and Singapore. It\u2019s a travel-themed word-finding game adopting the \u201cprogression\u201d mechanic of games such as Candy Crush Saga \u2013 think levels and three-star ratings \u2013 using a map of the world as its structure. It\u2019s expected to launch globally soon. I wonder if Words on Tour is an attempt to try something in this genre that suits in-app purchases more than advertising, and so will be more lucrative for Zynga. If so, New Words With Friends\u2019 importance to the company may also be as a funnel driving a decent chunk of its players towards the new game. Still, Knight says that New Words With Friends is significant on its own merits, especially if it can attract new players to what\u2019s already one of the most well-known mobile games. \u201cImagine if you\u2019re 20 years old and you get a new smartphone. Words With Friends came out a quarter of your life ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a loyal following, but with New Words we\u2019re getting new players in. In Australia, we see that the total population of new and existing Words players is larger now than it was just a few weeks ago. That\u2019s really exciting.\u201d \u2022 Zynga has lost 63% of its players.

Kim Jong-un, the portly 31-year-old who is North Korea\u2019s head of state, hasn\u2019t been seen in public since the beginning of September. In these circumstances, the mind begins to boggle. Is he having some kind of breakdown? Is he dying? Is he dead already? Speculation is a common feature of dictatorships, or any power structures that obsessively ration information. In 2012, there were similar rumours that Meles Zenawi, prime minister of Ethiopia \u2013 said to be mysteriously having treatment abroad \u2013 was actually dying. So it proved, but his illness remained \u201cundisclosed\u201d. After a car crash involving the son of Zambian president Michael Sata this year, it was said that not only was the president already dead but that he had already been embalmed. He recently scotched the stories by appearing in public looking rather healthy. Even for Robert Mugabe, travelling to Singapore in 2012 for treatment for prostate cancer \u2013 something he did maybe eight times that year alone \u2013 gave rise to whispers that he had actually died some time before. There has been speculation along similar lines about 91-year-old former prime minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew, and rumours of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s death proceeded the strongman\u2019s actual passing last year by several months. Shortly before his actual demise, the rumours were intensified by an open letter written to him by Fidel Castro, the former Cuban dictator. Castro is endlessly trying to scotch rumours that he has died. Strange things happen in the world of totalitarian rule, even a letter from one dead man to another. In nations where absolute power is wielded, those who owe their position to the leader cling to their influence by keeping them operating \u2013 perhaps even past the point of death \u2013 while they sort out some more permanent solution. The story of Stalin\u2019s mysterious death in 1953 suggests that, while the hands of the doctors treating him shook with fear, his inner circle played desperately for time. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone about Comrade Stalin\u2019s illness,\u201d KGB boss Laventiy Beria commanded his servants after his apparent stroke. There was no Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead. Quite the reverse. Stalin was the source of their power and without him, those around him feared they would lose more than their influence. It was nearly three years before his successor, Nikita Khrushchev, condemned him, and even then it was in secret. Nor does this secrecy and subterfuge apply only in dictatorships. Franklin Roosevelt was famously not told about his own cancer in 1944 in case it undermined his bid for a fourth term of office. When his illness became obvious to those around him, he was sent out exhaustingly on the campaign trail as proof of his good health. But these issues are much more urgent now that knowledge can be passed instantaneously. During the wartime struggle with the Nazis over the airwaves, the BBC\u2019s European news chief Noel Newsome realised that, for all the cleverness of Josef Goebbels\u2019s broadcasts, their failure to tell the whole truth was a big weakness. They would tell lies that were bound to emerge later. They would suppress information that their own people desperately wanted. It was this fatal vulnerability that lost the Nazis the \u201cairwave\u201d war, with 15 million Germans risking their lives to listen to Allied broadcasts.

Though few may have heard of him, Lemov is a growing influence on education in the US, where he works at Uncommon Schools, which manages 42 charter schools across New York, New Jersey and Boston. His influence is spreading to the UK, where politicians and education policymakers are lapping up his ideas. Former education secretary Michael Gove, his successor, Nicky Morgan, and colleagues at the Department for Education will be familiar with Lemov\u2019s methods, while any young teacher on a Teach First programme is virtually obliged to have a copy of his book. An updated version is being published this year. The book is intended to be a manual for teachers, providing practical knowledge and proven techniques that will make them teach better, and enable their students to get better results. It is less Dead Poets Society, a harsh sceptic might say, than How to Teach for Dummies. One Chicago teacher blogged: \u201cLemov\u2019s book contributes to the deprofessionalisation of teaching. He sends the message that anyone can do it \u2013 if they read the right manual.\u201d Former Gove adviser Sam Freedman, a Teach First director, is more enthusiastic. \u201cThe reason Lemov\u2019s Teach Like a Champion is one of the most popular books for new teachers, including Teach First participants, is because there are so few other places to look for simple routines that will help develop a good behaviour culture, enable rapid assessment and so on.\u201d Lemov is on a 10-week sabbatical in the UK, funded by the Ark Schools network, giving lectures to policymakers and workshops for teachers. Last month he delivered a lecture at the Policy Exchange, the rightwing thinktank set up by Gove in 2002; last week he held a two-day workshop for school leaders, costing $1,000 (\u00a3620) per person. When we meet in A rk\u2019s London offices, Lemov is with his two children who have just had a maths class \u2013 taught by dad \u2013 and after our interview he plans to take them to Sir John Soane\u2019s museum in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields. (No Madame Tussauds or London Dungeon today.) Lemov had wanted to be a professor of English literature. His specialism was journals of scientific interest. Then he turned his attention to improving the educational achievement, and therefore life chances, of children from deprived communities in the US. What makes him different is that he offers a practical approach to making teachers more effective in the classroom. It isn\u2019t magic. We don\u2019t have to go to Singapore and copy how they do it. Somewhere here, in a school in Market Harborough or Hexham or Hatfield, some teacher has come up with an idea or a solution that can make a real difference in the classroom. All we have to do is use the data from their results to find them, analyse how they\u2019ve done it, then share it with others. One problem here, it turns out, is that we do not have enough data. \u201cWe are way ahead of you,\u201d says Lemov. \u201cIn the last 10 years we\u2019ve been able to measure annual progress of kids systematically. If there\u2019s one thing that would improve the UK education system, it\u2019s data.\u201d How do teachers (and pupils) feel about that? People may like to think their work is immeasurable, says Lemov, but these days the price of failure is too high. \u201cTeachers are very anxious about being measured, then they find out how useful data is, and teachers who use data come to love it. \u201cWe live in a different society than we did 30 years ago. We had good working-class jobs in the US. They are gone now. It\u2019s a knowledge-based economy now and it\u2019s not right to say we are going to risk sending kids out there who are not prepared. I would like to be unmeasured too, but it\u2019s not a defensible position.\u201d Lemov\u2019s book is subtitled \u201c49 techniques that put students on the path to college\u201d, and even the most trivial classroom activities \u2013 such as dealing with requests for toilet breaks or handing out papers \u2013 are addressed. For example, Doug McCurry, founder of the Amistad academy in New Haven, Connecticut, has perfected a technique for handing out materials swiftly and effectively that Lemov calculates could save 63 hours during a school year. Another technique is \u201ccold calling\u201d. The problem with teachers asking questions in class, waiting for children to put their hands up with the answers, is that the children decide whether to participate. Lemov favours a no opt-out approach \u2013 there\u2019s no show of hands, everyone has to be prepared to answer. \u201cI decide as the teacher who is going to say the answer out loud, but everyone in the room does the work. A very identifiable, actionable thing you can do to change the dynamics in the classroom. \u201cIt\u2019s teaching as a craft \u2013 making it better. Teachers soldier on in anonymity, we never honour them. To me it\u2019s the most important work in society. Part of my goal in this book is to make them visible.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2014 because Doug Lemov does not run Uncommon Schools, as an earlier version said, but he works for them. This article was also amended to correct the number of Uncommon Schools.

Describing 500 schools as still failing, the prime minister will also give the hitherto low profile eight regional school commissioners extra powers to remove their leadership if deemed necessary. Cameron, anxious to move away from the diet of Europe and immigration that has dominated political debate, will say experts will be consulted to help develop the \u201crescue package\u201d which will be included in the Conservatives\u2019 general election manifesto. A National Teaching Service (NTS), funded by central government, is to be created, and would be made up of high-quality teachers ready to be sent out to poorly performing schools. Regional school commissioners, who are unelected former head teachers and teaching experts, would be able to intervene in any state school ruled inadequate by the education watchdog, Ofsted. It is the first initiative Cameron has undertaken with the new education secretary, Nicky Morgan, drafted into the cabinet to replace the unpopular Michael Gove. Morgan said that it had become necessary to \u201cgo further\u201d and target schools where she said \u201cfailure has become ingrained\u201d. She added: \u201cWe will not tolerate failure, and where we find it we will use tried and trusted interventions to turn things around in the interests of young people everywhere.\u201d The regional commissioners were largely developed by Gove as he realised the rapid extension of city academies meant the department for education was directly responsible for the oversight of thousands of academy and free schools in what was rapidly becoming an act of unwieldy centralisation. Under the new model, the commissioners will be able to order immediate personnel changes to governing bodies, introduce standard punishment tariffs for bad behaviour, and bring in behaviour experts to implement new policies on classroom discipline, school uniform standards and homework. They would also have powers to make \u201cimmediate personnel changes to the governing body to improve the calibre of leadership and ensure they have the skills they need to improve\u201d. Ofsted has largely been left to rate schools, but there was no systematic means of improving schools\u2019 performance. It is not yet clear how the new commissioners would work with the under-fire Ofsted under the Conservative plans. Last week it emerged that Gove had discussed how to remove Sir Michael Wilshaw as chief inspector of schools, but he responded on Friday, vowing to carry on in his position and claiming that he was a victim of \u201csmear campaigns\u201d. The former education secretary David Blunkett, in a report in May to the current shadow education secretary, Tristram Hunt, had proposed a new, more democratic, middle-tier body to oversee improvement of local schools led by a new local Directors of School Standards. The proposal was largely modelled on the successful London Challenge responsible for improving school standards in the capital. Hunt, just back from studying the widely praised Singapore education system, added:\u201cMinisters are now trying to play catch-up but the public will see that it is this government\u2019s damaging schools policy that has failed pupils.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/13/oath-turn-bad-teacher-into-good-one", "sentences": ["And, if you want to be really cynical about things, you could suggest that it only exists because his entire recent fact-finding mission to Singapore was a complete bust and this idea is basically just a ham-fisted stab at damage limitation."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-13T19:00:05Z", "title": "Yeah, Tristram, an oath is really going to turn a bad teacher into a good one", "tags": ["Education policy", "Teachers' workload", "Politics", "Education", "Tristram Hunt"], "article": "Exactly a decade ago, I was a teacher. And not a particularly great one at that. Admittedly, much of this had to do with circumstance \u2013 I was teaching English to Korean toddlers in a vaguely unscrupulous private institute, despite having no experience of teaching or Korean or toddlers \u2013 but that didn\u2019t matter. Whichever way you looked at it, I still sucked. I\u2019d come in hungover. I\u2019d sleepwalk through my lesson preparations. Conservatively, I\u2019d estimate that 90% of my time was spent making my students do colouring in while I sat in an impossibly tiny chair, with my knees around my ears, silently dreading the inedible mound of uncategorised meat that would invariably pass for that day\u2019s lunch. Once, for homework, I gave an older child a Korean-language insert from a Jay-Z album to translate. She came back with it the next day, looked me in the eye and said: \u201cI\u2019m just a kid.\u201d In summary, I was a bad teacher. But you know what would have made me a better teacher? An oath. Oh, sure, qualifications would have been nice. A bit of basic training might have helped, too. And learning the Korean for, \u201cI need to go to the toilet,\u201d would have saved me countless afternoons of scrunch-faced detergent-soaked floor-scrubbing. But an oath? That would have really sealed the deal. Make me stand somewhere slightly official-looking, ask me to promise to try quite hard most of the time, and bingo. I\u2019d magically become the best teacher ever. This is why I\u2019m fully behind Tristram Hunt\u2019s proposal to improve our schools by making all teachers read a hippocratic-style oath at the moment of graduation. True, the whole thing does sound a little like it was cobbled together to give Hunt something to talk about at a conference. And, if you want to be really cynical about things, you could suggest that it only exists because his entire recent fact-finding mission to Singapore was a complete bust and this idea is basically just a ham-fisted stab at damage limitation. But, still, he\u2019s probably on to something. Read an oath and you immediately feel a surge of pride about your job, which is exactly what teachers need. Close your eyes and imagine a teacher at an underperforming comprehensive, struggling to cope with relentless pressure from students, parents and governors \u2013 not to mention the unseen threat of Ofsted \u2013 and keeping going only by remembering that they made a vow years before. You see? Oaths are great. I love a good oath. More people should take them. I took an oath to always do my best as a Cub Scout, and I did always do my best, unless I was doing something about knots or flags or rounders or anything that distracted me from swapping football stickers with my friend at the back of the hall, in which case I probably half-arsed it a bit. Similarly, and I haven\u2019t looked this up or anything, but I\u2019m pretty sure that wedding vows have almost completely eradicated all forms of infidelity, just as the hippocratic oath prevented Dr Harold Shipman from ever existing. And teachers themselves aren\u2019t particularly thrilled about the prospect of taking an oath. Perhaps that\u2019s because they think it\u2019s nothing more than a meaningless pat on the head; a patronising substitution for bigger salaries, better facilities or more control over the work they actually happen to be experts in. Perhaps they\u2019ve been in the job long enough to know that there are good teachers and bad teachers, and the good teachers will always push themselves the extra mile to help a child no matter what the reward, but the bad teachers will still be lazy and uncooperative and resentful however many oaths they\u2019re forced to read. Or perhaps they just think that the oath might be taken in the eyes of God, and they\u2019re worried that they\u2019ll be murdered by an errant lightning bolt the second they pop outside for a crafty fag during double geography. Who knows what those crazy teachers think? They\u2019re drunk most of the time, anyway. But, listen, as ideas go, an oath for teachers is still miles better than \u201cTeaching not Tinkering\u201d, the slogan that Hunt schemed up for a conference back in April, presumably after ditching \u201cLessons not Loitering\u201d and \u201cStaffrooms not Stalactites\u201d after negative focus-group testing. So he\u2019s improving. Tristram Hunt is on the up-and-up. He\u2019s not in power yet, so he still gets to blunder around lobbing out daft policies willy-nilly in the hope that one of them will scan. Who knows, by the time he actually becomes education secretary, he might be able to implement something that doesn\u2019t sound like a desperately concocted Madlib that\u2019s been free-associated around a note he left on his phone in the middle of a fever-dream the previous night.

In just three fiscally irresponsible seasons the Brisbane Bears found themselves a whopping $26m in the red. Even the $4m they paid to enter the competition was still owed to the bank, and with their loan guaranteed by the failed Qintex empire of feckless tycoon Christopher Skase, the league\u2019s northern experiment was on the brink of collapse. Brisbane had been lucky to get into the VFL in the first place. The 1986 vote to admit them and the West Coast Eagles was only won on the bare minimum vote of 8-4 courtesy of Fitzroy unwittingly creating their future partner by changing their vote at the last minute, but while even the clubs who had voted \u2018no\u2019 were happy to take a cut of the lucrative licence fee they were less generous in helping Brisbane build a squad. The Bears chose eight experienced South Australians in the national draft, but were forced to fill the rest of their list with players unwanted by other clubs. Teams were allowed to offer anybody who had played at least one senior match or a reserves final, and not surprisingly everyone took advantage by attempting to offload the overpaid, over-the-hill or woefully inexperienced. Brisbane complained about Carlton offering them a player who had just retired.  Despite being used as a dumping ground Brisbane won 21 games across their first three seasons, but as Skase\u2019s empire collapsed the penniless club soon spiraled towards the foot of the ladder. A strike by senior players ruled them out of the 1990 pre-season competition and the Bears wouldn\u2019t win more than four games again until 1994. In a rare outbreak of actual joy in this list Brisbane finally came good, though not under their original identity. By 1995 they\u2019d shed almost every aspect of their original identity and finally moved from the Gold Coast to Queensland\u2019s capital. They qualified for their first finals series, and went within one game of a grand final in 1996. That year they merged with Fitzroy, and after an initial dip in fortunes, the Brisbane Lions under Leigh Matthews emerged a few years later as three-time premiers and one of the great sides of the modern era. 2) South Dragons (NBL \u2013 2006 to 2009) Everyone dreams of finishing their career with a moment of triumph so stunning that they can exit with arms raised in triumph never to return. The 2009 NBL champions achieved their own version of the feat, retiring unconquered but not without five years (and counting) of looking back in anger. South Dragons were founded in 2006 as the latest in the complicated lineage of \u201canybody but the Tigers\u201d Melbourne basketball teams. During home games the Victoria Titans helpfully displayed a family tree explaining how it worked - between 1979 and 1998 the St Kilda Saints became the Westside Saints then the Southern Saints, who merged with the Eastside Spectres (previously the Nunawading Spectres) to form Eastside Melbourne Magic who merged with the ex-Coburg now North Melbourne Giants to become the Titans. Got it? Then to complicate matters they too went broke and reemerged as the Victoria Giants. The new Giants didn\u2019t last long either, and after two seasons the Dragons bought their NBL licence. Though they had a losing record in their first season South qualified for the playoffs courtesy of a generous system which saw eight of 12 sides in the league included, but when they collapsed to a 5-25 record in their second year it looked like another challenger to the Tigers was heading down the gurgler. However that dud season was the catalyst for one of the most stunning turnarounds in Australian sporting history, with the Dragons finishing first the next season and appropriately beating the Tigers in the grand final. What should have become a great local rivalry was actually killed off by the Tigers. Both teams had agreed to sit out the 2010-2011 season in protest at a perceived lack of reform to the competition. The NBL was already lacking teams in Sydney or Brisbane and might have been forced to negotiate rather than lose both Melbourne sides but when the Tigers backflipped, South were left out in the cold.  The Dragons immediately disbanded their championship squad and went into a recess that would ultimately prove permanent. The local professional basketball scene was left to the Tigers (recently rebranded as Melbourne United), leaving their many detractors waiting patiently for a second Melbourne team to come along and reignite the rivalry. 3) Gold Coast United (A-League \u2013 2009 to 2012) There\u2019s little that Clive Frederick Palmer has turned his hand to without success. From property to mining and winning control of the Senate, his breathtakingly shambolic attempt at football club ownership might be the only chapter skimmed over in his autobiography. Before Palmer United there was Gold Coast United but despite Palmer tipping in $18m, the club became the latest to fall victim to a region which has (probably) killed more professional sporting teams per capita than anywhere else on Earth. Third place in their first season was encouraging but drama was never far away.  An opening home attendance of 7,526 was respectable enough, but by the time fellow expansion club North Queensland returned to Skilled Park a few weeks later the crows numbered just 2,616. Alarm bells had gone off in the lead-up to the match when Palmer announced he would cap attendances at 5,000 to save himself $100,000 a match in stadium rental fees and government transport levies. Under pressure Palmer was convinced to scrap the cap before the next home game, but crowds never recovered. Later that year only 4,109 turned out to see their inaugural finals appearance.  Next season attendances regularly dipped below 2,000, and though they were heading for the finals again just 5,088 combined turned up to see them play three home games in December 2010. With important players rapidly abandoning United they sank to the bottom of the league in their third year, and the walls began to close in on Palmer. In February 2012 he appointed 17-year-old Mitch Cooper as captain on his debut, sacked coach Miron Bleiberg for describing the appointment as \u201cceremonial\u201d then publicly referred to football as a \u201chopeless game\u201d. By this point all but the most hardcore fans had given up, and days after just 1,141 turned up for a match. When Palmer escalated his dispute with the FFA by sending players out with the shirt sponsor \u2018Freedom of Speech\u2019 the A-League finally had enough and booted him out. The rudderless United stumbled to the end of the season and died shortly after, while Palmer plotted to take revenge by forming a rival governing body for football in Australia. He soon lost interest in running the game and turned to running the country instead \u2013 he seems to be having much more fun doing that. 4) Adelaide Giants (ABL - 1989 to 1999) For a brief moment during the 1990s a weekly highlights package on Channel 10 prompted baseball to become something more than a minority concern in Australia. With none-more-90s aspects to the coverage (such as the title sequence which looked like it had been taken from a failed American sitcom), Timezone video game arcade ads on the fence and a young Warren Smith\u2019s gravity defying haircut we thrilled to the performances of ritzy franchises like the Melbourne Monarchs, Daikyo Dolphins and Sydney Wave for a while before normal service resumed. Though we\u2019re light on video proof of the existence of the Giants, ABL records show they were the league leaders in bland stability. In a competition where teams came and went on a yearly basis Adelaide were just one of three to complete the full 10 seasons under their original name, although they never played in a championship game. What we know is that their logo was a decidedly un-giant like thunderbolt and that they were affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who were seemingly unconcerned (or unaware) that Adelaide bore the same nickname as their most hated rival. The Giants\u2019 best chance at South Australia\u2019s first national baseball triumph since the 1980 Claxton Shield came in the league\u2019s final year. They dominated the regular season but collapsed in the playoffs, and along with the rest of the league were unceremoniously turfed out when (in an deal even Palmer might have said \u201cwhoa, hold up\u201d to) Aussie major leaguer Dave Nilsson paid $5m to acquire the rights to the struggling competition. Nilsson\u2019s new International Baseball League found little public interest and collapsed after two seasons. The ABL was rebooted for the 2008-09 season, and that year fans in the City of Churches finally got within striking distance of glory for the first time in nearly 30 years courtesy of the Adelaide Bite qualifying for the league\u2019s championship game. Sadly for the long suffering local baseball community they lost and haven\u2019t enjoyed a winning season since.  5) Christchurch Sirens (WNBL \u2013 2007 to 2008) \u2026 \u2026 who are not strictly \u2018Australian\u2019, but along with the Auckland (Football) Kingz, New Zealand Knights and Singapore Slingers represent failed attempts by sports administrators to lend a hand to our neighbours by including their sides in local competitions.  In the case of the three-time NBL champion New Zealand Breakers the idea might have worked too well, but history has shown sporting cultural exchange is more likely to end with administrators getting involved than in championship glory. Some exchanges have been easier to broker than others, with the A-League\u2019s Wellington Phoenix forced to sidestep Fifa rules by playing as an Australian team based in New Zealand in a similar fashion to tennis players having a postal address in the Bahamas for \u2018tax purposes\u2019. The Women\u2019s National Basketball League had no such issues when they welcomed the Christchurch Sirens for the 2007-2008 season, and in addition to the stunningly named American import Ashley Awkward (finalist in a college basketball \u2018name of the year\u2019 competition alongside Genesis Lightbourne and Lady Comfort) the new side were given an immediate leg-up by the inclusion of many of New Zealand\u2019s Tall Ferns women\u2019s national team.  They went 9-3 at home in their first year but missed the finals courtesy of 12 straight losses in Australia and finished eighth of 10 teams. It was a competitive start but the Sirens were destined to join not-very-fondly remembered teams such as the Hunter Mariners and Collingwood Warriors in playing a single season in an Australian national league then disappearing. The absurdity of a team from New Zealand playing in a competition contractually obligated to be referred to as the Australian Defence Force Women\u2019s National Basketball League at all times came to an end in 2008 when a major sponsor withdrew. In a league where sides were so reliant on sponsorship dollars that their fellow 2007 expansion club was officially called the Jimmy Possum Bendigo Spirit in tribute to a local homewares merchant, it was a fatal blow which left the club unable to continue in Christchurch.  There was a suggestion that the club would be relocated to Wellington, but Basketball Australia was having none of it and the Sirens became the latest in a Gold Coast-esque line of Trans-Tasman sporting fatalities. 6) Newtown Jets (NSWRL - 1908 to 1983)  To avoid a flood of complaints from furious league loyalists it should be noted that the Jets are in fact alive and doing very well in the second-tier New South Wales Cup. Which is great news, but it\u2019s been more than 30 years since the foundation NSWRL club appeared in the big time.  The Bluebags managed three premierships before 1943, but by the 1960s they were generally found nearer the bottom of the ladder than the top and hit rock-bottom with a wooden spoon hat-trick between 1976 and 1978. Desperate for any advantage which might lift them off the bottom of the ladder the Jets launched the most ambitious recruiting move in the game\u2019s history in 1977 by signing fringe NFL player Manfred Moore. After Moore scored the club\u2019s first try of the season it seemed like a stroke of genius, but four games later the demands of the brutal sport became too much and he decided to return to the US. Newtown would lose 20 in a row after Moore\u2019s debut, but his brief stint is so fondly remembered that for $35 the Jets will sell you a t-shirt featuring him hurling a football over the Henson Park grandstand. Just because. In 1981 Newtown briefly returned to prominence when they reached their first grand final since 1955 but were defeated, and with the competition expanding outside Sydney the cash-strapped club found themselves in the league\u2019s crosshairs after the 1983 season. They were unceremoniously booted out of the league along with Western Suburbs, but unlike the Magpies didn\u2019t have the resources to scrap their way back in via the courts. As a final indignity when they were officially excluded and a proposed move to Campbelltown collapsed, Wests moved into the area instead. The Jets live on, representing the many rugby league sides to have come and gone since 1908 \u2013 and famous teams from all codes who have reluctantly ended up in the lower leagues. From Fitzroy playing in Melbourne\u2019s amateur Australian rules competition, to the NSL clubs swept back to the state leagues in the ethnic cleansing frenzy of the A-League, these sides remain alive \u2018off-Broadway\u2019 for the benefit of both those who remember the good times, and anybody looking for an alternative to the ruthless corporate environment of today\u2019s modern sporting competition.

This seems an extraordinary admission from two editors of the Economist, the flag-bearer of English liberalism, which has long insisted that the non-west could only achieve prosperity and stability through western prescriptions. It almost obscures the fact that the 20th century was blighted by the same pathologies that today make the western model seem unworkable, and render its fervent advocates a bit lost. The most violent century in human history, it was hardly the best advertisement for the \u201cbland fanatics of western civilisation\u201d, as the American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr called them at the height of the cold war, \u201cwho regard the highly contingent achievements of our culture as the final form and norm of human existence\u201d.  Niebuhr was critiquing a fundamentalist creed that has coloured our view of the world for more than a century: that western institutions of the nation-state and liberal democracy will be gradually generalised around the world, and that the aspiring middle classes created by industrial capitalism will bring about accountable, representative and stable governments \u2013 that every society, in short, is destined to evolve just as the west did. Critics of this teleological view, which defines \u201cprogress\u201d exclusively as development along western lines, have long perceived its absolutist nature. Secular liberalism, the Russian thinker Alexander Herzen cautioned as early as 1862, \u201cis the final religion, though its church is not of the other world but of this\u201d. But it has had many presumptive popes and encyclicals: from the 19th-century dream of a westernised world long championed by the Economist, in which capital, goods, jobs and people freely circulate, to Henry Luce\u2019s proclamation of an \u201cAmerican century\u201d of free trade, and \u201cmodernisation theory\u201d \u2013 the attempt by American cold warriors to seduce the postcolonial world away from communist-style revolution and into the gradualist alternative of consumer capitalism and democracy. The collapse of communist regimes in 1989 further emboldened Niebuhr\u2019s bland fanatics. The old Marxist teleology was retrofitted rather than discarded in Francis Fukuyama\u2019s influential end-of-history thesis, and cruder theories about the inevitable march to worldwide prosperity and stability were vended by such Panglosses of globalisation as Thomas Friedman. Arguing that people privileged enough to consume McDonald\u2019s burgers don\u2019t go to war with each other, the New York Times columnist was not alone in mixing old-fangled Eurocentrism with American can-doism, a doctrine that grew from America\u2019s uninterrupted good fortune and unchallenged power in the century before September 2001. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 briefly disrupted celebrations of a world globalised by capital and consumption. But the shock to naive minds only further entrenched in them the intellectual habits of the cold war \u2013 thinking through binary oppositions of \u201cfree\u201d and \u201cunfree\u201d worlds \u2013 and redoubled an old delusion: liberal democracy, conceived by modernisation theorists as the inevitable preference of the beneficiaries of capitalism, could now be implanted by force in recalcitrant societies. Invocations of a new \u201clong struggle\u201d against \u201cIslamofascism\u201d aroused many superannuated cold warriors who missed the ideological certainties of battling communism. Intellectual narcissism survived, and was often deepened by, the realisation that economic power had begun to shift from the west. The Chinese, who had \u201cgot capitalism\u201d, were, after all, now \u201cdownloading western apps\u201d, according to Niall Ferguson. As late as 2008, Fareed Zakaria declared in his much-cited book, The Post-American World, that \u201cthe rise of the rest is a consequence of American ideas and actions\u201d and that \u201cthe world is going America\u2019s way\u201d, with countries \u201cbecoming more open, market-friendly and democratic\u201d. A world in flames One event after another in recent months has cruelly exposed such facile narratives. China, though market-friendly, looks further from democracy than before. The experiment with free-market capitalism in Russia has entrenched a kleptocratic regime with a messianic belief in Russian supremacism. Authoritarian leaders, anti-democratic backlashes and rightwing extremism define the politics of even such ostensibly democratic countries as India, Israel, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Turkey. The atrocities of this summer in particular have plunged political and media elites in the west into stunned bewilderment and some truly desperate cliches. The extraordinary hegemonic power of their ideas had helped them escape radical examination when the world could still be presented as going America\u2019s way. But their preferred image of the west \u2013 the idealised one in which they sought to remake the rest of the world \u2013 has been consistently challenged by many critics, left or right, in the west as well as the east. Herzen was already warning in the 19th century that \u201cour classic ignorance of the western European will be productive of a great deal of harm; racial hatred and bloody collisions will develop from it.\u201d Herzen was sceptical of those liberal \u201cwesternisers\u201d who believed that Russia could progress only by diligently emulating western institutions and ideologies. Intimate experience and knowledge of Europe during his long exile there had convinced him that European dominance, arrived at after much fratricidal violence and underpinned by much intellectual deception and self-deception, did not amount to \u201cprogress\u201d. Herzen, a believer in cultural pluralism, asked a question that rarely occurs to today\u2019s westernisers: \u201cWhy should a nation that has developed in its own way, under completely different conditions from those of the west European states, with different elements in its life, live through the European past, and that, too, when it knows perfectly well what that past leads to?\u201d     An empty billboard site in S\u00e3o Paolo, Brazil. Billboard advertising has been banned there since 2007.  Photograph: Tony de Marco    The brutality that Herzen saw as underpinning Europe\u2019s progress turned out, in the next century, to be a mere prelude to the biggest bloodbath in history: two world wars, and ferocious ethnic cleansing that claimed tens of millions of victims. The imperative to emulate Europe\u2019s progress was nevertheless embraced by the ruling elites of dozens of new nation-states that emerged from the ruins of European empires in the mid-20th century, and embarked on a fantastic quest for western-style wealth and power. Today, racial hatred and bloody collisions ravage the world where liberal democracy and capitalism were expected to jointly reign. This moment demands a fresh interrogation of what Neibuhr euphemistically called \u201cthe highly contingent achievements of the west\u201d, and closer attention to the varied histories of the non-west. Instead, the most common response to the present crisis has been despair over western \u201cweakness\u201d \u2013 and much acrimony over what Barack Obama, president of the \u201csole superpower\u201d and the \u201cindispensable nation\u201d should have done to fix it. \u201cWill the West Win?\u201d Prospect asks on the cover of its latest issue, underlining the forlornness of the question with a picture of Henry Kissinger, whose complicity in various murderous fiascos from Vietnam to Iraq has not prevented his re-incarnation among the perplexed as a sage of hardheaded realism. Robert Kagan, writing in the Wall Street Journal at the start of September, articulated a defiant neoconservative faith that America is condemned to use \u201chard power\u201d against the enemies of liberal modernity who understand no other language, such as Japan and Germany in the early 20th century, and Putin\u2019s Russia today. Kagan doesn\u2019t say which manifestation of hard power \u2013 firebombing Germany, nuking Japan, napalming Vietnam \u2013 the United States should aim against Russia, or if the shock-and-awe campaign that he cheerled in Iraq is a better template. Roger Cohen of the New York Times provides a milder variation on the clash of civilisations discourse when he laments that \u201cEuropean nations with populations from former colonies often seem unable to celebrate their values of freedom, democracy and the rule of law\u201d.  Such diehard believers in the west\u2019s capacity to shape global events and congratulate itself eternally were afflicted with an obsolete assumption even in 1989: that the 20th century was defined by the battles between liberal democracy and totalitarian ideologies, such as fascism and communism. Their obsession with a largely intra-western dispute obscured the fact that the most significant event of the 20th century was decolonisation, and the emergence of new nation-states across Asia and Africa. They barely registered the fact that liberal democracies were experienced as ruthlessly imperialist by their colonial subjects. For people luxuriating at a high level of abstraction, and accustomed to dealing during the cold war with nation-states organised simply into blocs and superblocs, it was always too inconvenient to examine whether the freshly imagined communities of Asia and Africa were innately strong and cohesive enough to withhold the strains and divisions of state-building and economic growth. If they had indeed risked engaging with complexity and contradiction, they would have found that the urge to be a wealthy and powerful nation-state along western lines initially ordered and then disordered first Russia, Germany and Japan, and then, in our own time, plunged a vast swath of the postcolonial world into bloody conflict. History\u2019s long-term losers The temptation to imitate the evidently triumphant western model, as Herzen feared, was always greater than the urge to reject it. For many in the old and sophisticated societies of Asia and Africa, chafing under the domination of western Europe\u2019s very small countries, it seemed clear that human beings could muster up an unprecedented collective power through new European forms of organisation like the nation-state and the industrialised economy. Much of Europe had first learned this harsh lesson in political and military innovation from Napoleon\u2019s all-conquering army. In the century after the Napoleonic wars, European societies gradually learned how to deploy effectively a modern military, technology, railways, roads, judicial and educational systems and create a feeling of belonging and solidarity, most often by identifying dangerous enemies within and without. As Eugen Weber showed in his classic book Peasants into Frenchmen (1976), this was a uniformly brutal process in France itself. Much of Europe then went on to suffer widespread dispossession, the destruction of regional languages and cultures, and the institutionalisation of hoary prejudices like antisemitism. The 19th century\u2019s most sensitive minds, from Kierkegaard to Ruskin, recoiled from such modernisation, though they did not always know the darker side of it: rapacious European colonialism in Asia and Africa. By the 1940s, competitive nationalisms in Europe stood implicated in the most vicious wars and crimes against religious and ethnic minorities witnessed in human history. After the second world war, European countries \u2013 under American auspices and the pressures of the cold war \u2013 were forced to imagine less antagonistic political and economic relations, which eventually resulted in the European Union.     A lorry with no logo in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Photograph: Tony de Marco    But the new nation-states in Asia and Africa had already started on their own fraught journey to modernity, riding roughshod over ethnic and religious diversity and older ways of life. Asians and Africans educated in western-style institutions despaired of their traditionalist elites as much as they resented European dominance over their societies. They sought true power and sovereignty in a world of powerful nation-states \u2013 what alone seemed to guarantee them and their peoples a fair chance at strength, equality and dignity in the white man\u2019s world. In this quest China\u2019s Mao Zedong and Turkey\u2019s Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk as much as Iran\u2019s democratically-elected prime minister Mohammed Mossadegh followed the western model of mass-mobilisation and state-building. By then European and American dominance over \u201cthe world\u2019s economies and peoples\u201d had, as the Cambridge historian Christopher Bayly writes in The Birth of the Modern World, turned a large part of humanity \u201cinto long-term losers in the scramble for resources and dignity\u201d. Nevertheless, the explicitly defined aim of Asia and Africa\u2019s first nationalist icons, who tended to be socialist and secular (Atat\u00fcrk, Nehru, Nasser, Nkrumah, Mao, and Sukarno), was \u201ccatch-up\u201d with the west. Recent ruling classes of the non-west have looked to McKinsey rather than Marx to help define their socioeconomic future; but they have not dared to alter the founding basis of their legitimacy as \u201cmodernisers\u201d leading their countries to convergence with the west and attainment of European and American living standards. As it turns out, the latecomers to modernity, dumping protectionist socialism for global capitalism, have got their timing wrong again. In the 21st century that old spell of universal progress through western ideologies \u2013 socialism and capitalism \u2013 has been decisively broken. If we are appalled and dumbfounded by a world in flames it is because we have been living \u2013 in the east and south as well as west and north \u2013 with vanities and illusions: that Asian and African societies would become, like Europe, more secular and instrumentally rational as economic growth accelerated; that with socialism dead and buried, free markets would guarantee rapid economic growth and worldwide prosperity. What these fantasies of inverted Hegelianism always disguised was a sobering fact: that the dynamics and specific features of western \u201cprogress\u201d were not and could not be replicated or correctly sequenced in the non-west. The enabling conditions of Europe\u2019s 19th-century success \u2013 small, relatively homogenous populations, or the ability to send surplus populations abroad as soldiers, merchants and missionaries \u2013 were missing in the large and populous countries of Asia and Africa. Furthermore, imperialism had deprived them, as Basil Davidson argued in The Black Man\u2019s Burden: Africa and the Curse of the Nation-State, of the resources to pursue western-style economic development; it had also imposed ruinous ideologies and institutions upon societies that had developed, over centuries, their own viable political units and social structures. Recklessly exported worldwide even today, the west\u2019s successful formulas have continued to cause much invisible suffering. What may have been the right fit for 19th-century colonialists in countries with endless resources cannot secure a stable future for India, China, and other late arrivals to the modern world, which can only colonise their own territories and uproot their own indigenous peoples in the search for valuable commodities and resources.     S\u00e3o Paulo. Photograph: Tony de Marco    The result is endless insurgencies and counter-insurgencies, wars and massacres, the rise of such bizarre anachronisms and novelties as Maoist guerrillas in India and self-immolating monks in Tibet, the increased attraction of unemployed and unemployable youth to extremist organisations, and the endless misery that provokes thousands of desperate Asians and Africans to make the risky journey to what they see as the centre of successful modernity. It should be no surprise that religion in the non-western world has failed to disappear under the juggernaut of industrial capitalism, or that liberal democracy finds its most dedicated saboteurs among the new middle classes. The political and economic institutions and ideologies of western Europe and the United States had been forged by specific events \u2013 revolts against clerical authority, industrial innovations, capitalist consolidation through colonial conquest \u2013 that did not occur elsewhere. So formal religion \u2013 not only Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and the Russian Orthodox Church, but also such quietist religions as Buddhism \u2013 is actually now increasingly allied with rather than detached from state power. The middle classes, whether in India, Thailand, Turkey or Egypt, betray a greater liking for authoritarian leaders and even uniformed despots than for the rule of law and social justice.    The atrocities of this summer have plunged political and media elites in the west into stunned bewilderment       But then western ideologues during the cold war absurdly prettified the rise of the \u201cdemocratic\u201d west. The long struggle against communism, which claimed superior moral virtue, required many expedient feints. And so the centuries of civil war, imperial conquest, brutal exploitation, and genocide were suppressed in accounts that showed how westerners made the modern world, and became with their liberal democracies the superior people everyone else ought to catch up with. \u201cAll of the western nations,\u201d James Baldwin warned during the cold war in 1963, are \u201ccaught in a lie, the lie of their pretended humanism; this means that their history has no moral justification, and the west has no moral authority.\u201d The deception that an African-American easily divined has continued, nevertheless, to enjoy political support and intellectual respectability long after the end of the cold war. Thus the editors of the Economist elide in The Fourth Revolution the history of mass slaughter in the west itself that led to the modern nation-state: the religious wars of the 17th century, the terror of French revolutions, the Napoleonic wars, the Franco-Prussian war and the wars of Italian unification, among others. Mainstream Anglo-American writers who vend popular explanations of how the west made the modern world veer between intellectual equivocation and insouciance about the west\u2019s comparative advantage of colonialism, slavery and indentured labour. \u201cWe cannot pretend,\u201d Ferguson avers, that the \u201cmobilisation of cheap and probably underemployed Asian labour to grow rubber and dig gold had no economic value.\u201d A recent review in the Economist of a history explaining the compact between capitalism and slavery protests that \u201calmost all the blacks\u201d in the book are \u201cvictims\u201d, and \u201calmost all the whites villains\u201d. Understandably, history has to be \u201cbalanced\u201d for Davos Men, who cannot bear too much reality in their effervescent prognoses of \u201cconvergence\u201d between the west and the rest. But obscuring the monstrous costs of the west\u2019s own \u201cprogress\u201d destroys any possibility of explaining the proliferation of large-scale violence in the world today, let along finding a way to contain it. Evasions, suppressions and downright falsehoods have resulted, over time, in a massive store of defective knowledge \u2013 an ignorance that Herzen correctly feared to be pernicious \u2013 about the west and the non-west alike. Simple-minded and misleading ideas and assumptions, drawn from this blinkered history, today shape the speeches of western statesmen, thinktank reports and newspaper editorials, while supplying fuel to countless log-rolling columnists, TV pundits and terrorism experts. The price of progress A faith in the west\u2019s superiority has not always been an obstacle to understanding the tormented process of modernisation in the rest of the world, as the French anti-communist Raymond Aron demonstrated in books like Progress and Disillusion (1968) and The Opium of the Intellectuals (1955). Aron believed the west made the modern world with its political and economic innovations and material goals, but did not flinch from examining what this fact really augured about the modern world. As he saw it, the conflicts and contradictions thrown up by the pursuit of modernity had been hard enough to manage for western societies for much of the last century. Industrial societies alone had seemed able to improve material conditions, and bring about a measure of social and economic equality; but the promise of equality, which staved off social unrest, was increasingly difficult to fulfill because specialisation kept producing fresh hierarchies. Some parts of the west had achieved some reduction in material inequalities, due to a market economy which produced both desirable goods and the means to acquire them; organised labour, which made it possible for workers to demand higher wages; and political liberty, which made the rulers accountable to the ruled. And some western countries had also, however brutally, got the sequencing broadly right: they had managed to build resilient states before trying to turn peasants into citizens. (\u201cWe have made Italy; now we must make the Italians,\u201d the Italian nationalist Massimo d\u2019Azeglio famously proclaimed in 1860.) The most successful European states had also accomplished a measure of economic growth before gradually extending democratic rights to a majority of the population. \u201cNo European country,\u201d Aron pointed out, \u201cever went through the phase of economic development which India and China are now experiencing, under a regime that was representative and democratic.\u201d Nowhere in Europe, he wrote in The Opium of Intellectuals, \u201cduring the long years when industrial populations were growing rapidly, factory chimneys looming up over the suburbs and railways and bridges being constructed, were personal liberties, universal suffrage and the parliamentary system combined\u201d.     S\u00e3o Paulo Photograph: Tony de Marco    Countries outside the west, however, faced simultaneously the arduous tasks of establishing strong nation-states and viable economies, and satisfying the demands for dignity and equality of freshly politicised peoples. This made the importation of western measures and techniques of success in places that \u201chave not yet emerged from feudal poverty\u201d an unprecedented and perilous experiment. Travelling through Asia and Africa in the 1950s, Aron discerned the potential for authoritarianism as well as dark chaos. There were not many political choices before societies that had lost their old traditional sources of authority while embarking on the adventure of building new nation-states and industrial economies in a secular and materialist ethos. These rationalised societies, constituted by \u201cindividuals and their desires\u201d, had to either build a social and political consensus themselves or have it imposed on them by a strongman. Failure would plunge them into violent anarchy. Aron was no vulgar can-doist. American individualism, the product of a short history of unrepeatable national success, in his view, \u201cspreads unlimited optimism, denigrates the past, and encourages the adoption of institutions which are in themselves destructive of the collective unity\u201d. Nor was he a partisan of the blood-splattered French revolutionary tradition, which requires \u201cpeople to submit to the strictest discipline in the name of the ultimate freedom\u201d \u2013 whose latest incarnation is Isis and its attempt to construct an utopian \u201cIslamic State\u201d through a reign of terror. The state under siege Applied to the many nation-states that emerged in the mid-20th century, Aron\u2019s sombre analysis can only embarrass those who have been daydreaming since 1989 about a worldwide upsurge of liberal democracy in tandem with capitalism. Indeed, long before the rise of European totalitarianisms, urgent state-building and the search for rapid and high economic growth had doomed individual liberties to a precarious existence in Japan. Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and South Korea went on to show, after 1945, that a flourishing capitalist economy always was compatible with the denial of democratic rights. China has more recently achieved a form of capitalist modernity without embracing liberal democracy. Turkey now enjoys economic growth as well as regular elections; but these have not made the country break with long decades of authoritarian rule. The arrival of Anatolian masses in politics has actually enabled a demagogue like Erdo\u011fan to imagine himself as a second Atat\u00fcrk. Turkey, however, may have been relatively fortunate in being able to build a modern state out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire. Disorder was the fate of many new nations that had been insufficiently or too fervidly imagined, such as Myanmar and Pakistan; their weak state structures and fragmented civil society have condemned them to oscillate perennially between civilian and military despots while warding off challenges from disaffected minorities and religious fanatics. Until the Arab spring, ruthless despots kept a lid on sectarian animosities in the nation-states carved out of the Ottoman empire. Today, as the shattering of Iraq, Libya and Syria reveals, despotism, far from being a bulwark against militant disaffection, is an effective furnace for it. Countries that managed to rebuild commanding state structures after popular nationalist revolutions \u2013 such as China, Vietnam, and Iran \u2013 look stable and cohesive when compared with a traditional monarchy such as Thailand or wholly artificial nation-states like Iraq and Syria. The bloody regimes inaugurated by Khomeini and Mao survived some terrible internal and external conflicts \u2013 the Korean and Iran-Iraq wars, the Cultural Revolution and much fratricidal bloodletting \u2013 partly because their core nationalist ideologies secured consent from many of their subjects. Since 1989, however, this strenuously achieved national consensus in many countries has been under siege from a fresh quarter: an ideology of endless economic expansion and private wealth-creation that had been tamed in the mid-20th century. After its most severe global crisis in the 1930s, capitalism had suffered a decline in legitimacy, and in much of the non-western world, planned and protected economic growth had become the chosen means to such ends as social justice and gender equality. In our own age, feral forms of capitalism, which after the Depression were defanged by social-welfarism in the west and protectionist economies elsewhere, have turned into an elemental force. Thus, nation-states already struggling against secessionist movements by ethnic and religious minorities have seen their internal unity further undermined by capitalism\u2019s dominant ethic of primitive accumulation and individual gratification.    All of the western nations are caught in the lie of their pretended humanism; this means the west has no moral authority       China, once the world\u2019s most egalitarian society, is now even more unequal than the United States \u2013 1% of its population owns one-third of the national wealth \u2013 and prone to defuse its increasing social contradictions through a hardline nationalism directed at its neighbours, particularly Japan. Many formally democratic nation-states, such as India, Indonesia, and South Africa, have struggled to maintain their national consensus in the face of the imperative to privatise basic services such as water, health and education (and also, for many countries, to de-industrialise, and surrender their sovereignty to markets). Mobile and transnational capital, which de-territorialises wealth and poverty, has made state-building and its original goals of broad social and economic uplift nearly impossible to achieve within national boundaries. The elites primarily benefitting from global capitalism have had to devise new ideologies to make their dominance seem natural. Thus, India and Israel, which started out as nation-states committed to social justice, have seen their foundational ideals radically reconfigured by a nexus of neoliberal politicians and majoritarian nationalists, who now try to bludgeon their disaffected subjects into loyalty to a \u201cJewish state\u201d and a \u201cHindu nation\u201d. Demagogues in Thailand, Myanmar, and Pakistan have emerged at the head of populations angry and fearful about being deprived of the endlessly postponed fruits of modernity. Identified with elite or sectarian interests, the unrepresentative central state in many countries struggles to compete with offers of stability and order from non-state actors. Not surprisingly, even the vicious Isis claims to offer better governance to Sunnis angry with the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. So do Maoist insurgents who control large territories in Central India, and even drug-traffickers in Myanmar and Mexico. A shattered mirror Fukuyama, asserting that the \u201cpower of the democratic ideal\u201d remains immense, claimed earlier this year that \u201cwe should have no doubt as to what kind of society lies at the end of History\u201d. But the time for grand Hegelian theories about the rational spirit of history incarnated in the nation-state, socialism, capitalism, or liberal democracy is now over. Looking at our own complex disorder we can no longer accept that it manifests an a priori moral and rational order, visible only to an elite thus far, that will ultimately be revealed to all. How then do we interpret it? Reflecting on the world\u2019s \u201cpervasive raggedness\u201d in the last essay he wrote before his death in 2006, the American anthropologist Clifford Geertz spoke of how \u201cthe shattering of larger coherences \u2026 has made relating local realities with overarching ones \u2026 extremely difficult.\u201d \u201cIf the general is to be grasped at all,\u201d Geertz wrote, \u201cand new unities uncovered, it must, it seems, be grasped not directly, all at once, but via instances, differences, variations, particulars \u2013 piecemeal, case by case. In a splintered world, we must address the splinters.\u201d     S\u00e3o Paulo Photograph: Tony de Marco    Such an approach would necessarily demand greater attention to historical specificity and detail, the presence of contingency, and the ever-deepening contradictions of nation-states amid the crises of capitalism. It would require asking why nation-building in Afghanistan and Iraq failed catastrophically while decentralisation helped stabilise Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim country, after a long spell of despotic rule supported by the middle class. It would require an admission that Iraq can achieve a modicum of stability not by reviving the doomed project of nation-state but through a return to Ottoman-style confederal institutions that devolve power and guarantee minority rights. Addressing the splinters leaves no scope for vacuous moralising against \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d: in their puritanical and utopian zeal, the Islamic revolutionaries brutally advancing across Syria and Iraq resemble the fanatically secular Khmer Rouge more than anything in the long history of Islam. A fresh grasp of the general also necessitates understanding the precise ways in which western ideologues, and their non-western epigones, continue to \u201cmake\u201d the modern world. \u201cShock-therapy\u201d administered to a hapless Russian population in the 1990s and the horrific suffering afterwards set the stage for Putin\u2019s messianic Eurasianism. But, following Geertz\u2019s insistence on differences and variations, the ressentiment of the west articulated by nationalists in Russia, China, and India cannot be conflated with the resistance to a predatory form of modernisation \u2013 ruthless dispossession by a profit-driven nexus of the state and business \u2013 mounted by indigenous peoples in Tibet, India, Peru and Bolivia. In any case, the doubters of western-style progress today include more than just marginal communities and some angry environmental activists. Last month the Economist said that, on the basis of IMF data, emerging economies \u2013 or the \u201clarge part of humanity\u201d that Bayly called the \u201clong-term losers\u201d of history \u2013 might have to wait for three centuries in order to catch up with the west. In the Economist\u2019s assessment, which pitilessly annuls the upbeat projections beloved of consultants and investors, the last decade of rapid growth was an \u201caberration\u201d and \u201cbillions of people will be poorer for a lot longer than they might have expected just a few years ago\u201d. The implications are sobering: the non-west not only finds itself replicating the west\u2019s violence and trauma on an infinitely larger scale. While helping inflict the profoundest damage yet on the environment \u2013 manifest today in rising sea levels, erratic rainfall, drought, declining harvests, and devastating floods \u2013 the non-west also has no real prospect of catching up with the west. How do we chart our way out of this impasse? His own discovery of the tragically insuperable contradictions of westernisation led Aron into the odd company of the many thinkers in the east and the west who questioned the exalting of economic growth as an end in itself. Of course, other ways of conceiving of the good life have existed long before a crudely utilitarian calculus \u2013 which institutionalises greed, credits slavery with economic value and confuses individual freedom with consumer choice \u2013 replaced thinking in our most prominent minds. Such re-examinations of liberal capitalist ideas of \u201cdevelopment\u201d, and exploration of suppressed intellectual traditions, are not nearly as rousing or self-flattering as the rhetorical binaries that make laptop bombers pound the keyboard with the caps lock glowing green. Barack Obama, who struggled to adhere to a wise policy of not doing stupid stuff, has launched another open-ended war after he was assailed for being weak by assorted can-doists. Plainly, Anglo-American elites who are handsomely compensated to live forever in the early 20th century, when the liberal-democratic west crushed its most vicious enemies, will never cease to find more brutes to exterminate. The rest of us, however, have to live in the 21st century, and prevent it from turning into yet another rotten one for the western model. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 October 2014.

The power of the internet is never more readily felt than when a foreign company gets in touch unexpectedly. Galia Orme, founder of Choc Chick which specialises in raw chocolate making kits, launched her online shop in 2008. Orme had no initial plans to export her products but in January this year she was contacted by a German startup, Plain, that was developing a new milk drink. They were looking for good quality, organic and ethically sourced cocoa for their milk chocolate drink Plain Kakao and had discovered her website. \u201cWhen the German company contacted me I was delighted. Having a company suddenly contact me out of the blue was the most incredible opportunity. I am still quite a small business in east Sussex, so was genuinely amazed that they had even heard about my products. But that is the power of the internet and being able to search and source from anywhere in the world fairly easily.\u201d After several Skype calls and emails, Orme received her first order for over 100kg of Choc Chick raw cacao for Plain\u2019s first run of 20,000 cans. \u201cI had always wanted to export as my aim is to bring raw chocolate making to everyone but was worried it would be too complicated and first of all wanted to build my brand in the UK.\u201d Her main concerns were not knowing the market and how to price and position her products. \u201cWe were very fortunate as Plain were keen to source from a company that had the same brand values so it was a perfect fit. We also require any company using our products to include our logo on their website and product information to keep brand consistency.\u201d After gaining confidence and knowledge from exporting to Germany, Orme has just secured her first major US order from Whole Foods Market - North Atlantic. It was a similar story of discovery for founders of What\u2019s On 4, Sam Willoughby and Suzanne Borrell. Launched in 2006, Willoughby saw a gap in the market for an up-to-date and comprehensive directory of activities for children under five and has since expanded to include adults and babies. \u201cIt came out of the blue,\u201d says Borrell. \u201cSam had never given the idea of exporting serious attention. Then in 2009 Elise Easdown, a mother in Australia, emailed and said she loved what she saw on the What\u2019s On 4 sites and explained how Aussie mothers were crying out for such a product. Elise had all the skills, resources and enthusiasm to take on the sites so Sam swiftly set about a franchise structure and What\u2019s On 4 Australia was born.\u201d What\u2019s On 4 has launched franchises in six countries including Ireland, Switzerland and Singapore following enquiries from parents who contacted the company after finding its website. Now that the business exports to a range of countries it keeps brand consistency through highly comprehensive training, online support, weekly meetings, centrally designed logos, websites and branding and bespoke events training. \u201cTime zones and timeframes can be interesting, we can find ourselves working slightly odd hours to accommodate meetings, however in terms of the training and support, a team member could be 50 miles or 5,000 miles away and it makes no difference,\u201d says Borrell. \u201cIt was important for us to ensure we had a cultural awareness of the market we were getting into, for example business is done in quite a different way in Singapore but having good people on the ground overcomes this.\u201d For Blackdown Artisan Spirits founder, Sarah Thompson, exporting was an inspiring experience and has enabled her to source new ingredients and develop unique recipes. Established in 2013, the company produces spirits from natural botanicals and the distillery is surrounded by 40 acres of silver birch trees which were the inspiration for its Sussex Dry Gin \u2013 the first ever gin produced in the county. They began exporting last year in small quantities to Ibiza, Sweden and the US as a result of orders coming in through their website. After working with the International Chef Exchange, an initiative that involves chefs from different countries swapping kitchens to produce food and drink from their home regions, the company now exports to Holland. \u201cMy biggest concerns were the value of the goods, plus allowing someone to sell on your behalf,\u201d says Thompson. \u201cBy creating such small batches of handcrafted products, you do become protective over what you create and you have to learn to trust and ensure you are working with people who will represent your brand in the correct manner.\u201d Of course exporting can open up a business to untapped markets, create a community, develop relationships across the world and reach consumers where direct selling wouldn\u2019t have been a possibility, however there are pitfalls which accidental exporters can be vulnerable to. If companies export before they are ready or without sufficient research, issues such as brand consistency, hidden costs and paper work, pricing and positioning products and dealing with time zones and language barriers can cause unforeseen and difficult situations. Lesley Batchelor OBE, director general of the Institute of Export, explains: \u201cOne of the biggest dangers of DIY exporting is that businesses are hit by VAT regulations that they haven\u2019t anticipated and don\u2019t understand. Exported goods can attract local taxes that the seller hasn\u2019t taken account of in their pricing and they can be left considerably out of pocket. Other areas that can cost are packaging and paperwork, including customs\u2019 regulations.\u201d SMEs thinking of exporting can contact their local UK Trade and Investment office to arrange a meeting with an international trade adviser.

The more you can speak of other people\u2019s languages, the more you can be part of their lives and enrich your own. I was a disaster at languages at school. I obtained 5 out of 200 in O level French \u2013 an all time record. I was badly taught and I could never see the point. But then as a young Royal Marine to Singapore in the early 1960s (a bachelor I should stress) I heard that in Malay there was one word for \u201clet\u2019s take off our clothes and tell dirty stories\u201d. Suddenly I saw the point. I never found the word, but in the process learnt my first language. Then came in the little jungle war in Borneo in the mid-60s. As the only person in Commando who could speak the local language, I was sent to the deep jungle among the Dayak people. In their long-houses there were dried human heads hanging from the rafters. I decided I would feel altogether more comfortable, if I knew their language too. Then I spent two years learning Mandarin Chinese in Hong Kong. One day, at a banquet with fellow students and teachers I tried to make small talk with my female Chinese teacher. \u201cHave you ever flown in an aircraft?,\u201d I asked. Or that was what I thought I asked. In fact, muddling my Chinese tones, what came out of my mouth was \u201cHave you by any chance sat upon a flying penis?\u201d Then came German (briefly), French and Bosnian.

The Brazil captain took his impressive tally to 40 goals in 58 matches after his strikes against a shabby Japanese side on a patchy National Stadium pitch deemed \u201cfar short of international standards\u201d by Singapore\u2019s Football Association. Neymar had no problems with the poor surface, however, as the Barcelona striker entertained the 51,577 crowd with flicks and tricks around his cool finishes. He rattled the post with a free-kick a minute before opening the scoring in the 18th minute when he rounded the Japan goalkeeper, Eiji Kawashima, and lashed the ball into an empty net after being put clear by Diego Tardelli. The goal allowed Brazil, who had been lethargic after the heavy travel schedule and Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win over Argentina in Beijing, to slow the tempo against the Asian champions, who were missing the injured Shinji Kagawa and opted to start with Keisuke Honda and Yuto Nagatomo on the bench. Honda came on at the start of the second period but it was the Brazilian bench who had a greater impact, with Philippe Coutinho slippinga ball through Japan\u2019s porous backline to Neymar, who slotted home a second in the 48th minute. The hard-working Shinji Okazaki almost pulled one back with a right-footed snap shot from a narrow angle that cannoned back off the post but it was a brief highlight for the otherwise isolated striker. Dunga, in his second spell in charge after Luiz Felipe Scolari resigned in July following the World Cup, brought on the experienced Robinho and Kak\u00e1 to get among the scoring fun. Kak\u00e1 almost obliged with his first touch, but his 77th-minute header was pushed on to the bar by Kawashima. Japan failed to clear and when a shot came back in from the left the goalkeeper could only palm it straight to Neymar who swept it home. Kak\u00e1, back playing for S\u00e3o Paulo before he moves to Orlando City, then turned provider as he swung over a cross from the left that Neymar leapt highest to head in in the 81st minute. The win was a fourth out of four for Dunga\u2019s Brazil, who have yet to concede a goal since he returned with the task of rebuilding the side after their humiliating 7-1 World Cup semi-final defeat to Germany and 3-0 loss to Holland in the third-place match."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2014/oct/15/the-aaa-rated-club-which-countries-still-make-the-grade", "sentences": ["Only nine countries in world are AAA rated by all main agencies     Nine countries are AAA by all three main agencies Photograph: mtkang / Alamy/Alamy    While the three main ratings agencies \u2013 Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch \u2013 are divided on the credit worthiness of numerous countries, they are unanimous that the following are AAA rated:  Australia  Canada Denmark Germany Luxembourg Norway  Singapore Sweden Switzerland   The UK is still AAA rated by Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s     George Osborne Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian./Christopher Thomond    When George Osborne took office in 2010, he vowed to safeguard Britain\u2019s treasured AAA rating, arguing he would restore the nation\u2019s economic credibility."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-15T08:05:38Z", "title": "The AAA-rated club: which countries still make the grade?", "tags": ["Business", "Rating agencies", "Finland"], "article": "Finland has become the latest country to be stripped of its coveted AAA credit rating, after Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s downgraded it one notch to AA+.

The company, which was included in Disney\u2019s \u00a32.4bn purchase of Lucasfilm in 2012, was set up in 1975 by the Star Wars creator to pioneer groundbreaking special effects in his original space saga. Almost 40 years on, the division will once again oversee all the visual and special effects for the upcoming new instalments of Star Wars, most of which will now be done in the new London studio. With filming on the revived popular franchise just three weeks away from completion at Pinewood studios in Buckinghamshire, the decision by ILM to expand their operations to London\u2019s Soho means that the new Star Wars films will have even more of a British grounding. Lynwen Brennan, the president of ILM, said the decision to open a London studio, building on their current bases in San Francisco, Vancouver and Singapore, had been directly tied to the filming of Star Wars in the UK. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been very interested in having ILM setting up a studio in London for quite some time. I\u2019ve been very aware of the level of talent there is in this city as well as the amazing creative community. So when Disney announced we were going to be making the Stars Wars movies in London, that was the perfect opportunity for us. Here we have a lengthy franchise with a good number of films out ahead of us and a longevity of work that we know we can invest in.\u201d Brennan confirmed that the new London studio would have \u201ca huge role to play\u201d in the new Star Wars films, the first which is due out in December 2015. Over four decades, ILM has grown to become one of the largest visual effects companies in the world. It has done the effects for over 300 films, including Back to the Future, ET and Avatar, and forthcoming credits include the reboot of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the next instalment in the Jurassic Park series, Jurassic World. The London studio will be home to 200 newly hired staff, headed up by Ben Morris as creative director, who won an Oscar for his work on the visual effect for The Golden Compass in 2008. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilms and a producer on Star Wars VII, said it was \u201cquite remarkable standing here within three weeks of finishing filming on Star Wars episode VII\u201d. She continued: \u201cThis studio continues a long tradition of Stars Wars films being made in London, it goes back to 1976. I think Stars Wars aspires to technical excellence and that\u2019s what brings ILM to London today as this explosion of creativity inside the UK has been quite remarkable.\u201d Also attending the opening event on Wednesday was the chancellor, George Osborne, who said that Star Wars had been \u201cseminal\u201d to his childhood and described his recent visit to the set at Pinewood as \u201cspine-tingling\u201d. Osborne recounted how a meeting with Lucasfilm\u2019s president Kennedy at Downing Street in February last year had opened his eyes to the benefits of \u201cgenerous tax breaks\u201d to support the special effects industry in the UK further, encouraging companies such as ILM to open offices in London. Indeed, Brennan conceded that the company had been drawn to the UK to utilise the newly enhanced film tax relief scheme introduced by the government in April 2014, offering vast tax breaks for creative companies. In September it was revealed that Disney, ILM\u2019s parent company, has been handed nearly \u00a3170m by the UK taxman in return for agreeing to make films in the UK. This includes a record \u00a331.9m tax credit to film the next instalment of its Avengers movie series in Britain, which will be the first project the London ILM studio will work on. \u201cThe government tax breaks are definitely helping, you can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s helping, but tax breaks alone are not enough to make us expand to London,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are frankly better tax breaks elsewhere in the world, so what we really come for is the talent. What I will say is that the government\u2019s investment in the industry here has made it very vibrant, with a lot of talent that\u2019s able to stay here and have consistent work. So that\u2019s a definitely a benefit for us.\u201d John Knoll, ILM\u2019s chief creative officer, said the work of London-based visual effects companies such as Framestore, who last year won both a Bafta and an Oscar for their work on Gravity, proved the UK was at the forefront of the industry. He said: \u201cI\u2019m excited by the tremendous talent pool that is available here and clearly the UK companies have been doing fantastic work for years now. I think there is great opportunity by setting up a studio here to see if you can learn from the local talent. I do expect that some of the things that happen in the London studio will affect how we work in our other studios round the world.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/17/wikileaks-trans-pacific-partnership-drastic-australian-concessions", "sentences": ["The publication on WikiLeaks of the intellectual property (IP) chapter comes on the eve of the latest round of negotiations in Australia between the 12 member countries, Australia, the US, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Peru, Chile, Brunei and New Zealand.", "\u201cA rebel alliance of Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, and other Pacific Rim countries have pushed back, arguing for recognition of public objectives for intellectual property \u2013 such as the protection of public health, access to knowledge, and competition.\u201d Rimmer said the TPP could also affect journalists and whistleblowers."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-17T08:42:18Z", "title": "WikiLeaks' free trade documents reveal 'drastic' Australian concessions", "tags": ["Australian politics", "Pharmaceuticals industry", "International trade", "Global economy", "Australia news", "World news", "WikiLeaks"], "article": "Secret negotiations over the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement have apparently been breached by another leak of material which shows Australian consumers could pay more for cancer medicines and face criminal penalties for non-commercial copyright breaches. The publication on WikiLeaks of the intellectual property (IP) chapter comes on the eve of the latest round of negotiations in Australia between the 12 member countries, Australia, the US, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Peru, Chile, Brunei and New Zealand. The agreement has the capacity to affect Australian domestic law in many areas, but the secrecy of negotiations means citizens of member countries do not have full access to the Australian government\u2019s preferred outcomes. Two of the more contentious areas in the IP area relate to copyright and pharmaceuticals. For example, current patent law allows drug companies a monopoly on drugs they have created for a defined period, meaning other companies are not allowed to copy and sell the drug formulations as \u201cgenerics\u201d for that period. This is considered reasonable as it rewards the company for the initial research investment, which can be costly. Once the patent period ends, cheaper drugs flood the market, bringing down the price for consumers. Yet the text would suggest that the agreement could extend the patents. If Australia agrees to an extension of patents, the government would allow drug companies to keep the price inflated for a longer period, making the drug less affordable.  The US and Japan, the largest holders of intellectual property, have been keen to pursue stronger laws for breaches of copyright, including criminal penalties for non-commercial copyright infringements. That could cover internet downloads of television shows or music, where people do not make any money out of the product. The leaked document suggests that opposition among the smaller countries to criminal penalties for non-commercial breaches is waning. Matthew Rimmer, an expert in intellectual property law at the Australian National University, said the TPP could affect a range of laws, including Australia\u2019s tobacco plain packaging laws.  \u201cThe US and Japan are pushing for stronger and longer intellectual property rights,\u201d he said.  \u201cA rebel alliance of Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, and other Pacific Rim countries have pushed back, arguing for recognition of public objectives for intellectual property \u2013 such as the protection of public health, access to knowledge, and competition.\u201d Rimmer said the TPP could also affect journalists and whistleblowers. \u201cThe US is pushing for criminal procedures and penalties for the disclosure of trade secrets in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Such provisions could impact upon not only corporate espionage, but the work of journalists, media organisations, information technology activists, and whistleblowers.\u201d Jon Edwards from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said the agreement appeared to walk back safeguards in previous treaties that reserve the right of governments to get around drug-company patents on drugs if necessary \u201cto protect public health\u201d. The draft preamble of the leaked chapter narrows this safeguard by identifying specific instances \u2013 \u201cHIV/Aids, tuberculosis, malaria, and other epidemics\u201d \u2013 where IP rights can be circumvented. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that language would embolden pharmaceutical companies to challenge government under the TPP where a country seeks a compulsory license to produce a generic medicine and the company feels it doesn\u2019t meet that criteria because it\u2019s not an emergency or an epidemic,\u201d he said. He said Australia had appeared to join with the US and Japan in backing so-called \u201cevergreening\u201d tactics, when pharmaceutical companies try to extend their monopoly over a drug by patenting new formulas or methods that are \u201cnot genuinely innovative in terms of their therapeutic value\u201d. \u201cThat might include minor changes to existing drugs which might be combining two existing drugs in the same pill, but actually it treats the same condition. [Under the draft chapter] companies would be granted a patent for that and have an extended monopoly period for that innovation,\u201d he said. Trish Hepworth of the Australian Digital Alliance said some of the most worrying elements of the leaked agreement related to criminalisation of breaches and 100-year copyright terms for authors. The alliance represents libraries, universities, schools, technology companies and consumers.  \u201cWe see, for example, a push to criminalise any form of recording of a movie in a movie theatre, no matter how long or whether anybody else ever sees it,\u201d Hepworth said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous overkill that would mean kids larking around with smart phones while the previews are on will be committing criminal offences.\u201d Hepworth said the document showed the negotiations had advanced closer to agreement. She warned any agreement would set global norms for trade, given the member countries account 40% of the world\u2019s gross domestic product. \u201cIt is essential we reject the most draconian proposals on the table and support other countries who are seeking to implement flexible and positive language,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the digital, cultural and innovative industries set to drive much of our future economic prosperity, we need our international agreements to support our national interest.\u201d  Critics, including the consumer group Choice, have urged the Australian government to release the full text of the TPP agreement before signing up to it to ensure consumers are not adversely affected by the agreement, which would essentially trump Australian law. Choice spokesman Matt Levey said it was not acceptable for the Australian public to be forced to rely on leaked documents when so many areas of Australian law could be affected."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/oct/17/serena-williams-still-reminding-pat-cash-delusion", "sentences": ["I mention this here because of the news this week about Serena Williams, who has retained the world No1 ranking, nudging up past Martina Hingis into fourth on the all-time list of longest No1s, while also turning up at the WTA finals in Singapore despite a chronic knee injury and thus helping to ensure that she ends the year ahead of perennial Serena-lite Maria Sharapova at the age of 33."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-17T15:21:35Z", "title": "Serena Williams still reminding Pat Cash delusion takes many forms | Barney Ronay", "tags": ["Serena Williams", "Tennis", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Sports reporters tend to cherish the moments when they got there first. That time when, shoe\u2011horned into some wind-blown press box you turn a glazed and bloodshot eye towards the pitch and find yourself gripped suddenly by some vision of the future: the infant superstar, the world champ in mufti, the man-child sporting genius emerging ready-made from his urban dustbin, nostrils flaring, a scowl of destiny across his brow. Of course, this doesn\u2019t happen very often, if ever. Most of the time the future presents itself and you just happen to be looking the other way. For example, I was in Innsbruck in June 2008 for Spain versus Russia, the moment the greatest international football team of the modern age began a run of 19 tournament matches that brought three trophies and a legend of glorious soft-touch collectivism. Not bad, this Spain team I wrote. One thing, though. They need to drop this Xavi chap. Too much passing. Slows things down. Yup, Xavi. The greatest midfielder of his era, who would define a champion style like no other player in history. He\u2019s your problem. Just get it forward. Hit Fernando. Yes, well, demand it, son. I mention this here because of the news this week about Serena Williams, who has retained the world No1 ranking, nudging up past Martina Hingis into fourth on the all-time list of longest No1s, while also turning up at the WTA finals in Singapore despite a chronic knee injury and thus helping to ensure that she ends the year ahead of perennial Serena-lite Maria Sharapova at the age of 33. At moments such as these, you see, my thoughts turn to Pat Cash \u2013 Come on Pat! Up here! Ladies and gentlemen, Pat Cash! \u2013 who seven years ago wrote what is surely one of the great wrong calls of modern sporting history, a newspaper column in which he dismissed Williams as both \u201ca lost cause\u201d and \u201cdeluded\u201d, a player with \u201ca limited attention span\u201d, lacking the \u201cfortitude\u201d and \u201capplication\u201d to get back to winning tennis tournaments. To be fair, Cash had some evidence to support his views at the time and made his case with erroneous lucidity. But the fact remains there has always been a part of tennis that has wanted Serena to fail: to turn out to be in some way a mistake, a lacuna, an oversight. As long ago as the 2005 Australian Open she was being forced to deny she was finished (a point she reinforced by winning the tournament). And two years later there was Cash, consigning to the dustbin of history \u2013 and he\u2019s not angry here, just a little sad \u2013 one of his sport\u2019s all-time great champion athletes, a washed up 25-year-old who would before long be eclipsed by the combined grand slam might of Ana Ivanovic and Nicole Vaidisova. Since when \u2013 despite being so deluded and finished \u2013 Serena has won 11 grand slam singles titles and two Olympic gold medals. She didn\u2019t just defeat Sharapova in the final of that Australian Open two weeks later, she annihilated her in an hour, chucked her racket in the air, did a lap of honour, high-fived the crowd and with a very genuine sense of eloquent and unmawkish affection, devoted the win to her murdered sister, Yetunde. So not, it seems, actually finished after all then. Indeed one of the brilliant things about The Cash Declaration is that in attempting to list everything wrong with Serena it has instead turned out to be a perfect distillation of so many things that are right. Yes: she remains a serial comeback artist. But more than this, and as Cash captures so well, her success has come despite a vague, often unspoken, often spoken, sense of broader hostility. Not just the talk over the years of not taking tennis seriously enough by missing tournaments \u2013 as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi did too at times \u2013 but beyond this the suggestion that her particular brand of on-court greatness counts a little less, as though to win this way \u2013 to be stronger, more athletic, more thrillingly competitive \u2013 is in some way cheating, a shortcut, a get-out. Which is, of course, a basic misunderstanding of how sport works. Serena may not be built along the lines of the wonderfully dainty Martina Hingis, who played a set of tennis as though delivering a crisp, punitive lecture on geometry and basic physics to some hulking sixth form reprobate. She may not have the soft touch of Agneska Radwanska, who interprets the sport as a selection of beautiful little precision engineered moments, a bar room brawl that can still be won with a series of brilliantly timed sarcastic remarks. But nobody ever bludgeoned their way to 18 grand slams, just as power itself isn\u2019t a gift but a craft, a product of timing and practice and technique. The Williams serve is a refined knockout blow. That famous forehand is a stately, beautifully orthodox thing of rotation and extension, and pure mechanical grace. And this is the best thing about Serena: the comprehensive confounding of expectations. Here she comes: ditzy, a flake but somehow also supremely hard\u2011nosed, the girl who couldn\u2019t concentrate but who is now the oldest WTA No1 of all time. Not to mention a career gadfly, with her avaricious outside interests; who is, it turns out, only the second-best-paid female tennis player behind Sharapova, who has remained top of the money charts through the last decade of being regularly swatted off court and who is even now hawking about her wretched sweet shop empire with apparent impunity. There is, of course, talk now of a final reckoning-up in the months to come. That knee isn\u2019t getting any easier and it seems all but impossible, entering the 20th year of her Cash-doomed, fortitude-free professional career that Williams will claim the four grand slams she needs to equal Steffi Graf in the open era. And yet she remains a remarkable and indeed inspirational athlete. For now it might just be best \u2013 Hi, tennis! \u2013 to keep those oddly muted and conditional farewells on hold a little longer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/17/united-nations-effective-debate-security-council", "sentences": ["Francesco Mancini, senior adviser, International Peace Institute, Singapore, @ManciniFrFrancesco works on geopolitics, global issues, and how to prevent and solve armed conflicts."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-17T18:35:06Z", "title": "Reflecting on 'collective failure': is the United Nations still relevant?", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Live Q&As", "United Nations", "Conflict and development", "Humanitarian response", "Syria", "humanitarians", "Ban Ki-moon"], "article": "Even the most workaholic of United Nations bureaucrats must be examining their to-do list with trepidation right now.

As the UN approaches its 70th year, it seems a good time to assess the effectiveness of the multilateral body to address the issues of the 21st century. The UN Security Council\u2019s lack of achievement has been well documented. Last year Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon called the war in Syria \u201cour collective failure\u201d which would \u201cremain a heavy burden on the standing of the United Nations\u201d. UN human rights commissioner Navi Pillay went further: \u201cThe killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis,\u201d she said when she left her post in August.  Pillay\u2019s accusation centred on the security council\u2019s inabilty to pass a resolution. In September, France proposed changing the process so that in the case of \u201cmass crimes\u201d the five permanent members do not have the power of veto. Britain\u2019s UN ambassador supported the change and so did other representatives, but Russia, China and the United States stayed silent. The US is also guilty of frequently falling to pay its UN member fees.  The US, Britain, France, China and Russia became permanent members in 1946 because they were victors in the Second World War. In 2014, is that still relevant? Is it time that power was distributed more widely, extending perhaps to emerging markets and the Brics countries? Would decision making be even harder with more countries in the inner circle? Of course, the UN\u2019s mission is much more than peacekeeping. Has it done better at promoting development than at preventing war? When all is said and done, should credit be given where it\u2019s due?

Led by its founder, Tim Hauser, who has died suddenly of heart failure, aged 72, the group combined contemporary and nostalgic sounds from the jazz, gospel and pop traditions. Hauser set a standard for immaculate stage outfits and choreography, whose slickness enthralled international audiences for five decades. Critics and reviewers were sometimes harder to please. Born in Troy, New York, to F Jackson Hauser, an insurance adjuster and his wife Theresa, a school secretary, Hauser was raised in New Jersey. He sang in a doo-wop harmony group at St Rose high school, Belmar, and in folk groups at Villanova University, Philadelphia, before serving in the air force in the mid-1960s. A brief career in market research for the National Biscuit Company followed, but in 1970 he left Madison Avenue to found the first version of the Manhattan Transfer, named after the 1925 novel by John Dos Passos. In these early years, Hauser drove a cab to support himself and the group had no distinctive sound, veering between country, R&amp;B and the jazz and swing styles favoured by Hauser himself. A new Manhattan Transfer took shape in 1972 when Hauser recruited Laurel Mass\u00e9, Janis Siegel and Alan Paul, the last of whom was appearing in the Broadway production of the musical Grease. After intensive rehearsals to perfect their four-part harmonies on an eclectic mixture of jazz, gospel and 40s show tunes, they built up a reputation through early performances on the New York cabaret circuit where audience members included Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Ahmet Ertegun, the head of Atlantic Records. Ertegun was so enthused by the Manhattan Transfer that he not only signed the group but co-produced their first, self-titled, album with Hauser. That album included a version of the Glenn Miller standard Tuxedo Junction, which became a minor hit in Britain, paving the way for Chanson d\u2019Amour, a 1958 composition by Wayne Shanklin. Its mixture of French and English lyrics helped to make the group well known throughout western Europe. There were more hits in the next two years, beginning with the albums Coming Out (1977), Pastiche (1978) and Live (which had been recorded during the group\u2019s triumphant 1978 British tour and reached No 4). There were also top 20 singles: Walk in Love (1978), On a Little Street in Singapore (1978), and Spice of Life (1984), their final British hit. Although their later records did not sell in such large numbers, the Manhattan Transfer established a loyal fan base across the globe. The quartet kept up a steady stream of international concert performances, with only one change of personnel, when Cheryl Bentyne replaced Mass\u00e9 in 1978 after she was injured in a road accident. In the past couple of years, there were visits to the Philippines, Australia, South Africa and Japan, where the group has a particularly enthusiastic following \u2013 Hauser\u2019s only solo album, Love Stories (2007), was made for the Japanese label King. The Manhattan Transfer was a favourite with the electorate of the Grammies, winning 10 awards in the 80s alone. The first, in 1980, was for a vocalese version of Weather Report\u2019s Birdland, in which lyrics were set to instrumental solos and Hauser\u2019s voice mimicked the bass lines of Jaco Pastorius note for note. The originator of vocalese, Jon Hendricks, later collaborated with the Manhattan Transfer, whose many albums include tributes to Louis Armstrong and Chick Corea, and to the music of Brazil. Earlier this year, Hauser launched his own brand of pasta sauce, called I Made Sauce. He was taken ill travelling to a show in New York state. Hauser is survived by his third wife, Barb, a son, Basie, and daughter, Lily, and his sister, Fayette. \u2022 Timothy DuPron Hauser, singer, born 12 December 1941; died 16 October 2014"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/20/shanghai-club-scene-dance-music-china", "sentences": ["\u201cCertainly in comparison to cities like Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul, which have more settled and mature scenes."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-20T12:41:59Z", "title": "Champagne and grit: the two sides of Shanghai\u2019s club scene", "tags": ["Dance music", "Music", "Clubbing", "Culture", "Electronic music", "Pop and rock", "Paris Hilton"], "article": "A westerner heading into one of Shanghai\u2019s many super-clubs would recognise much of their surroundings: speakers spew EDM Rihanna remixes, punters order overpriced champagne or \u00a34.20 water bottles, and by 3am you can spot people who are too drunk to stand, let alone dance.  But one difference dominates here: there\u2019s no actual dancefloor. Instead, located in front of the elevated DJ booths at bling venues such as LINX, Mook and MYST (the latter acronym stands for \u201cMoving You Stunning Trip\u201d), are the most expensive VIP tables. Whereas in the west the highest rollers get to hide away in private rooms, here they are proudly on view for everyone to envy. At LINX they are elevated into this position ... quite literally: the VIP section is periodically lifted up via hydraulic pumps. Venues such as these \u2013 and many others in cities China-wide \u2013 are packed every weekend. And they\u2019re filled with an overwhelmingly local, newly moneyed clientele that generally isn\u2019t there for the DJ talent. Shanghai\u2019s big club culture may be dominated by social status-graspers rather than dance connoisseurs, but it has nevertheless become a popular stop for globe-hopping superstar DJs. The likes of Steve Aoki and DJ Falcon regularly return, seduced by high performance fees and the chance to explore the madcap city. \u201cShanghai is starting to attract the international DJ crowd,\u201d says Tim Crouch, entertainment director and DJ at Shanghainese favourite Mook, which has played host to Paris Hilton\u2019s DJ skills and an LMFAO PA set. \u201cBut we have catching up to do compared to cities in Korea and Japan. They have clubs that are focused purely on dance music and the underground scene, whereas here it\u2019s more mainstream. The style of music is almost second to the celebrity factor.\u201d The dance scene in Shanghai is healthier than the band scene and it\u2019s easy to understand why. It\u2019s tough for foreign bands to get visas to play in China, and many gigs end up getting cancelled anyway, limiting the international influence on local acts. DJs however only need to turn up with a laptop carried in hand luggage in order to take home a decent pay cheque.             If this all sounds somewhat soulless then it\u2019s exciting to find that, beyond the pneumatic thump of the super-clubs, a strong, largely expat-run alternative dance scene has evolved, largely as a reaction to them. Clubs such as the Shelter (a converted bomb shelter), Arkham and DADA attract feted, cultish acts that often end up building strong connections with the city. \u201cThe DJs love it,\u201d says Reggie Ba-Pe, an Australian who set up the charmingly-named S.T.D. club promotion company in 2007 as well as Arkham last year. \u201cShanghai is so different to the usual places they play, especially in venues like Arkham or The Shelter. It feels like a club from New York or Berlin that got dropped in the middle of China.\u201d Lauded underground dance types such as Hyperdub Records chief Kode9 keep coming back \u2013 he even released a single, Xinfu Lu, named after a Shanghai street. Goldie, meanwhile, has played to hipster expats at the Shelter numerous times. \u201cShanghai\u2019s on the top of the list when it comes to futuristic cities,\u201d he said ahead of his last gig here. \u201cShanghai\u2019s underground scene has come a long way,\u201d agrees Ba-Pe. \u201cCertainly in comparison to cities like Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul, which have more settled and mature scenes. Shanghai is grittier, it\u2019s raw.\u201d The champagne-glugging rich kids at LINX and MYST probably wouldn\u2019t agree with his \u201cgritty\u201d diagnoses. But they\u2019re probably completely unaware of the vibrant scene emerging on their doorstep.

That\u2019s just the latest startling figure for a game that launched for smartphones and tablets in November 2012. It has remained a fixture at the top of app store Top Grossing charts ever since. Now it\u2019s getting a sequel: Candy Crush Soda Saga. It launches today on Facebook, and will be available for mobile phones and tablets before Christmas, although King has been testing it on Android in some countries already. Not that the company is describing it as a sequel. \u201cWe don\u2019t consider it a sequel. It\u2019s just an additional title for the people who love Candy Crush, which is still a huge game being regularly updated with new levels,\u201d King\u2019s chief creative officer Sebastian Knutsson told the Guardian, ahead of the launch. \u201cIt\u2019s one of our biggest launches ever. We wanted to create a game that brought something fresh to Candy Crush. But you can play it side-by-side with the original game, and we will continue developing both in parallel.\u201d The main addition for Candy Crush Soda Saga is, as you may have guessed, soda: purple bottles which can be used to flip gravity while players are matching sweets and creating combos to make them disappear. \u201cWe have evolved and innovated a lot in the game\u2019s mechanics. Dropping soda in makes a big difference to the gameplay, and makes it distinctly unique versus the original game,\u201d said Knutsson. The new game is also a subtle change of strategy for King. Until now, \u201cSaga\u201d has been the brand for its puzzle games: Bubble Witch Saga, Farm Heroes Saga, Pet Rescue Saga and so on. Now, though, the company is trying to capitalise on \u201cCandy Crush\u201d as a brand in its own right. \u201cWe look at some of our key games as franchises: it\u2019s a commitment that these games will keep evolving,\u201d said Knutsson. \u201cWe are building for the long haul, and Candy Crush is definitely our biggest franchise.\u201d It might be the biggest, but the original game has peaked. King\u2019s chief executive Riccardo Zacconi admitted as much when speaking to analysts after the company reported its financial results for the second quarter of 2014. \u201cCandy Crush declined more than we had expected,\u201d said Zacconi, referring to the \u201cgross bookings\u201d metric that describes how much players have spent in the game. \u201cCandy Crush had its peak gross bookings in Q3 of 2013 and accordingly we expect a continual decline in gross bookings from this franchise in Q2.\u201d Candy Crush Soda Saga may be arriving in the nick of time for King, then: the company\u2019s share price has been taking a battering in recent months as investors fretted that the lucrative Saga formula was wearing thin. In the second quarter of this year, King\u2019s revenues and gross bookings were both down on the first quarter, as were its number of monthly unique users and monthly unique payers \u2013 the latter being people who actually spend money rather than play for free. Zacconi admitted to analysts that \u201cour non-Candy Crush games did not grow as much as we had expected\u201d in the second quarter. Which puts a lot of pressure on Candy Crush Soda Saga to buck that trend once it comes out for mobile devices. Is the Saga bubble bursting, because people are tiring of the format and its many imitators? \u201cWe need to keep innovating rather than becoming stale and only doing the same thing over and over again,\u201d said Knutsson. \u201cWe know we have that capacity. If we keep doing Sagas, and everybody is imitating Sagas as well, of course there\u2019s going to be risk. There is flattery in imitation: we\u2019ve created a format that has become very mainstream... But you have to bring something new to the experience.\u201d     Candy Crush Soda Saga. Photograph: PR    King\u2019s critics \u2013 there are a fair few of them \u2013 may scoff at the thought, given that many of the company\u2019s games are strongly inspired by older titles: Bejeweled for Candy Crush Saga, Peggle for Papa Pear Saga, Puzzle Bobble for Bubble Witch Saga and so on. What can King bring that\u2019s new? Interestingly, Knutsson focused less on specific genres or gameplay, and more on one of the features that\u2019s already a big part of the Saga games: social networking. \u201cI personally think there is a lot of social interaction that is missing from most games. Mobile games are still very much a solitary experience, but in the long term, the strongest games will also be the social games where you can interact with other players and make new friends,\u201d he said. Anticipating the likely follow-up question, Knutsson continued. \u201cPeople bugging people for lives on Facebook is not truly social. People can really make new friends, and meet up or chat and flirt a bit. That brings something new to the table.\u201d That said, King is eyeing new genres, as shown by its purchase in August of Singapore-based mobile developer Nonstop Games in a deal worth $6m initially, and up to $84m depending on its future revenues. At the time, King told investors that its new studio would \u201ccontribute new titles outside of our traditional casual genre\u201d. Knutsson has little to add on specific details, but acknowledges the ambition. \u201cWe\u2019re very strong on casual, and have a huge base of players. But we are looking at other types of games we could bring to our network, and Nonstop have experience in those types of games,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we look at 2016, we\u2019re going to have a much more blended portfolio of games, but many of those games are early in development.\u201d What won\u2019t change is the use of the \u201cfree to play\u201d business model where games make their money mainly from in-app purchases of virtual items and currency. It remains a divisive topic, albeit with the division between core gamers who argue passionately online against free-to-play, and the more mainstream gamers who don\u2019t even know there\u2019s a passionate argument going on: they\u2019re just playing the games on their smartphones and tablets, and on Facebook. \u201cIt\u2019s the core gamer, the old console games industry and the developers that see this as the top topic. The average player is quite happy they can download hundreds of games and try them for free,\u201d said Knutsson. \u201cIf you go to the core gamer blogs, there is a very different dialogue around free-to-play, even though you have these massively popular free-to-play games like League of Legends and Hearthstone that are loved by that demographic. Those games don\u2019t get badmouthed.\u201d Is the mobile games market healthy, though? At the time of writing, the average Top 20 Grossing iPhone game in the US has been out for well over a year, making it harder than ever for developers to break in to those upper reaches. Are games like Candy Crush Saga, Clash of Clans, The Simpsons: Tapped Out, and Puzzle &amp; Dragons stifling innovation? Knutsson suggested not. \u201cThe market is actually growing: the mobile apps economy is growing by 20% year-in-year, and expecting to do that for the next five years at least,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is huge growth in the market: even if you have a Top 25 game only, that slot is actually worth much more than two years ago. In a few years\u2019 time, the whole Top 100 will have a lot of viable companies. The industry is growing fast, but it is more competitive now.\u201d     Smartwatches like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Gear range could be a new opportunity for games. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/FABRIZIO BENSCH/Reuters/Corbis    Will that industry still be focused mainly on smartphones and tablets? Like its rivals, King is concentrating on mobile for now, but Knutsson said it is keeping an open mind on other kinds of device. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all those platforms, from consoles to smartwatches. To bring the right experience, it should be a connected device, so you can make the game social and interact with others. But it\u2019s more about the size of the opportunity: we don\u2019t need to be the first mover on a new technical platform,\u201d he said. No Candy Crush Soda Saga \u2013 Watch Edition just yet, then? \u201cWatches are good for playing games.

Well we immediately thought of the day when Arsenal\u2019s Eduardo da Silva broke his leg at Birmingham City in 2008 but that match finished before 3pm. William Gallas stayed on the pitch for a little longer, though. But help is at hand, Ian. \u201cI distinctly remember the Chelsea v Everton FA Cup fourth-round replay in 2011 being played on a Saturday lunchtime,\u201d says Sam Huxley. \u201cAs the game went to extra-time, and then penalties, the game finished at 3.10pm, and I\u2019m pretty sure was shown on ESPN. Therefore, the blackout rule wasn\u2019t observed in this instance.\u201d And Steve Williams adds: \u201cAlthough it is true that live football isn\u2019t permitted to be shown on British TV between 2.45 and 5.15 on a Saturday, in practice the situation described would never happen as matches in progress are allowed to be broadcast to their completion. This doesn\u2019t mean an enterprising broadcaster would be able to get around it by showing a match kicking off at 2.44pm but they can continue as long as they can reasonably have been expected to finish before the black-out. \u201cHence in February 2011, ESPN showed Everton vs Chelsea in an FA Cup fourth round replay with a Saturday 12.45 kick-off which went to extra time and penalties and wasn\u2019t finished until about quarter past three. But ESPN were still able to show the whole thing.\u201d Ah, the romance of the cup. We do have one problem, though, namely that all available evidence suggests that while the match was indeed televised on ESPN, it actually began at 12.30pm. See, look here \u2013 and if you can\u2019t trust the Guardian squad sheets, which would be understandable, then here\u2019s more proof on the FA\u2019s website. Meanwhile the Guardian\u2019s minute-by-minute report shows no sign of kick-off being delayed until 12.45pm. Nonetheless it seems that the match, which was won by Everton on penalties after finishing 1-1 and took roughly 127 minutes to complete, did end after 3pm, continued to be televised and did not cause any of the afternoon\u2019s kick-offs to be delayed. A fat lot of good it did Everton, though. Having beaten Chelsea, they then went and lost at home to Reading in the next round. Oh Moyesie! HAT-TRICK OF HEADERS (2) Last week we discussed players who have scored hat-tricks of headers and you good people have come up with a few more. \u201cOn 13 September 1994, Newcastle United\u2019s first game in Europe for 17 years saw a headed hat-trick by Robert Lee against Antwerp in a 5-0 away win,\u201d says Leonardo Manfredi. \u201cHappy days.\u201d Happy days indeed and a shameful show of ambition from Lee. Doesn\u2019t he know that\u2019s not the way things are done at Newcastle? Stig Wallerman also writes in with news from Sweden: \u201cSwede Ralf Edstrom, only 20 years old and earning his second cap, headed home three times when Sweden came back from 1-3 to 4-4 in a friendly against the Soviet Union in 1972. He went on to score four goals in the 1974 World Cup (and a total of 140 from a career of 303 top flight games), and to become league winner in Sweden, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\u201d MANAGERIAL CHANGERS VERSUS LEAGUE POSITION \u201cWhat with Watford on their fourth manager, sitting third in the Championship, have any clubs previously had more managers in a season than their finishing position in the table,\u201d Ewan Minter asks. \u201cAnd probably excluding teams with two managers and finishing first, which I imagine has happened quite a few times.\u201d Here\u2019s an answer from James Straughan: \u201cIn the 2005/06 season, Heart of Midlothian finished second in the SPL, despite numerous changes in manager. George Burley lasted until 21 October, before being replaced by John McGlynn (caretaker), followed by Graham Rix (8 November 2005 \u2013 22 March 2006) who was in turn replaced by Valdas Ivanauskas; 3 permanent managers for a team which finished second.\u201d LEAGUE GAMES AGAINST TEAMS WHOSE NAME START WITH THE SAME LETTER \u201cAmidst Watford\u2019s current policy of replacing their manager every other week, their last five league fixtures have been against Brighton, Brentford, Blackburn, Bournemouth and Blackpool, all of whose team names start with the letter B,\u201d Owen Keating last week. \u201cHas any other team ever played so many consecutive league games against teams whose names start with the same letter?\u201d Well everyone loves alphabet banter, no one more so than Eran Rabl. \u201cIt might be a bit of a cheat, but the best answer I could come up with is 14, in Israel. It\u2019s a bit of a cheat since most of the teams\u2019 names start with either Hapoel or Maccabi. \u201cBack in the late \u201860s there was a bit of a match-fixing problem in Israel, mostly by teams affiliated to the same sport organisation (Hapoel, Maccabi and Beitar) aiming to help each other to championships, promotions and avoiding relegation. In order to fight this, the IFA fixed the league schedule so that a team would play other teams from its sport organisation first, and then against teams from other organisations. \u201cThis meant that Shimshon Tel Aviv, affiliated to the Hapoel organisation, started the league against all teams whose name started with Hapoel, and since there were 7 of those in the league, this meant 14 consecutive matches against \u201cH\u201d teams. \u201cFor example, in 1965-66: Hapoel Haifa (rounds 1 &amp; 2), Hapoel Mahane Yehuda (rounds 3 &amp; 4), Hapoel Petah Tikva (rounds 5 &amp; 6), Hapoel Ramat Gan (rounds 7 &amp; 8), Hapoel Be\u2019er Sheva (rounds 9 &amp; 10), Hapoel Tel Aviv (rounds 11 &amp; 12) and Hapoel Jerusalem (rounds 13 &amp; 14). This was repeated in 1966-68, 1968-69, 1970-71, 1971-72 and 1972-73.\u201d KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \u201cI wonder if you can help me,\u201d Aladair Maughan asked in 2002 . \u201cI remember reading about a match being played in an African cup competition (I think) where both teams were trying to score own goals in order to try to make/try to prevent the game from going into extra time and being won on a golden goal. Does anyone know the exact details of this, or if it\u2019s just an urban myth? It might sound like an urban myth, Alasdair, but it\u2019s (almost) 100% true. The crazy events you describe took place in a Shell Caribbean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada in 1994. Going into the last group game Barbados needed to beat Grenada by two goals to qualify for the final stages. Anything less and Grenada went through. So far, so simple. Except that the organisers had decided that, in the case of extra time, a golden goal would count as two goals. You don\u2019t have to be Einstein to work out what happened next. Barbados raced to a 2-0 lead before Grenada made it 2-1 with seven minutes remaining. The Barjans were heading out unless they scored a goal; any goal. Fortunately for them, with three minutes left, they did just that - only not in the right net. Their deliberate own goal made it 2-2 and propelled the game towards extra time. Now, farcically, Grenada needed to score a goal (at either end) to go through. Cue frantic defending of both penalty areas by Barbados until the final whistle. Such dubious shenanigans were rewarded, however, when Barbados scored the golden goal - this time in Grenada\u2019s net - four minutes into extra time to win the match 3-2 (or 4-2 according to the rules of the tournament) and qualify for the finals. Incidentally, the match is detailed in more depth here However this isn\u2019t the only example of a blatant own-goal being scored to further a team\u2019s ambitions. As James Syme points out, it also happened in the infamous 1998 Tiger Cup game between Thailand and Indonesia. \u201cWhoever won would get to face hot favourites Vietnam in the next round, so both teams tried to throw the match,\u201d he says. \u201cAt 2-2 and with a few minutes left, the Indonesians dropped all pretence and turned on their own goal, now defended by Thai players. \u201cIn injury time the Indonesian keeper-captain Mursyid Effendi \u2018saved\u2019 the ball, turned round and thumped the ball into his own goal for a 3-2 final result.\u201d Justice was eventually served, however. For not only did Indonesia and Thailand lose their semi-final games (to Singapore and Vietnam, respectively) but both were also fined $40,000 for \u201cviolating the spirit of the game.\u201d Meanwhile Mursyid Effendi was banned for life. \u2022 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive. CAN YOU HELP? \u201cThe starting line-up for Man Utd last night versus West Brom featured 7 naturally left-footed players: Rojo, Shaw, Blind, Januzaj, Di Maria, Mata, and van Persie,\u201d remarks Fergus Brady. That left only De Gea, Rafael, Jones and Herrera as right-footed players in the team. Given that around only 10% of the world\u2019s population are left-footed, surely this is exceptional? Are there any other examples of high-profile teams where the majority of players favoured the \u2018more cultured\u2019 left side? \u201cIn the A-League, Brisbane defender James Donachie has scored an own goal in each of the season\u2019s first two matches,\u201d cheers Dean Kelly. \u201cHas this season start ever been replicated or even \u201cbettered\u201d elsewhere by another unfortunate soul before?\u201d \u201cThere are currently four former Southampton managers managing other clubs in the Premier League - Alan Pardew (Newcastle), Harry Redknapp (QPR), Mauricio Pochettino (Spurs) and Nigel Pearson (Leicester),\u201d states Martin Smith. \u201cIs that a record?\u201d \u2022 Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/oct/22/global-box-office-gone-girl-fury-teenage-mutant", "sentences": ["An encouraging Taiwanese hold (+33%), plus sustained No 1s in Hong Kong and Singapore bode well for David Fincher\u2019s film\u2019s chances in the bigger South Korean (23 Oct) and Japanese (12 Dec) markets."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-22T10:08:29Z", "title": "Global box office: Middle East embrace of Gone Girl helps keep it on top", "tags": ["Culture", "Film", "Brad Pitt", "Film industry", "Fury", "Gone Girl", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"], "article": "The winner Another convincing hold in the US (-33%, to $17.8m) helped Gone Girl stay on top of the global pack, plumped up by new unveilings in Israel, the UAE and others.

An encouraging Taiwanese hold (+33%), plus sustained No 1s in Hong Kong and Singapore bode well for David Fincher\u2019s film\u2019s chances in the bigger South Korean (23 Oct) and Japanese (12 Dec) markets.               If it does add a few extra tens of millions, that would make Gone Girl Ben Affleck\u2019s third highest worldwide take, ahead of Argo ($232.3m) and Good Will Hunting ($225.9m); it surely won\u2019t trouble Armageddon or Pearl Harbor. The Shermanator              How to read Fury\u2019s $23.7m US No 1? A decent enough number, but it feels lowish for a punchily marketed, Sherman-tank action film humming with Brad Pitt\u2019s star power. It\u2019s especially disappointing in the wake of last year\u2019s $66.4m debut for World War Z, the actor\u2019s best ever, featuring the 50-year-old in a relatively new paternal persona. Could Fury be a sign that audiences are less keen on him as the reconfigured Papa Pitt, instead of the unhinged mavericks and sun-kissed playboys of Fight Club and Ocean\u2019s Eleven et al? Actually, the decider this time could be that US film-goers \u2013 despite the flag-waving reputation \u2013 are surprisingly not that crazy for second-world-war films. None, apart from Pearl Harbor, has ever opened at more than $50m; Fury\u2019s, the fourth highest debut for a straight WW2 film, is actually a qualified success, faring better than Monuments Men ($22m) earlier this year and 2008\u2019s Valkyrie ($21m), which also relied on big names to break through the sepia factor. The quintessential modern WW2 film, Saving Private Ryan, did better abroad (55.1% of total gross) than in the States. So that\u2019s where you\u2019d expect Pitt\u2019s star quotient and the war setting to really snap together into high gear next week, as it extends out into other territories. Reverse Bay parking              Thanks to a raft of major European openings, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles re-entered the worldwide top 10, after nearly a month on the margins. Is it conspiracy thinking to speculate that producer Michael Bay might have kept it away from more developed markets until late in its run? That is where his dodgy rep and scepticism about his trademark barrage of SFX and dim-wit 80s bandinage \u2013 in full evidence on Turtles \u2013 might have set the tone for coverage of the remake, and most damaged its chances in the emerging Euro-periphery, Asian and Latin American markets for which it was largely engineered. Holding it back is calculating business nous. The TMNT brand \u2013 instilled in a new generation through the Nickleodeon cartoon \u2013 has at least partially transcended doubts in the US and elsewhere about the personnel involved: sturdy UK ($7.7m), French ($4.1m) and German ($6.1m) first weekends can be chalked up next to the film\u2019s better-than-expected US opening in August. The current $375m running total is split virtually 50/50 domestic and international, at the low end of this year\u2019s blockbuster crop (interestingly, almost par with New Line\u2019s original Turtles once the 1990 film\u2019s $201.9m take is inflation-corrected to $367m). With a Chinese release imminent, Bay\u2019s version should end up comfortably ahead. Iron Man magnetism              Last week\u2019s underwhelming $13.3m US start for the Robert Downey Jr-Robert Duvall courtroom comedy-drama hybrid The Judge put some question marks over whether the former\u2019s star appeal could thrive outside of flashy SFX-driven (Iron Man) and high-concept-fuelled (Sherlock Holmes) franchises. Launching character-driven films on a global scale is not easy even for the A-list these days; a true test of an actor\u2019s deeper connective aura. The first set of overseas figures contains evidence both for the defence and the prosecution on RDJ: a fine No 2 opening in Russia ($1.6m) and a decent $731,000 in Brazil, up-and-coming markets where seeing Tony Stark in a more sombre guise might be a novelty; disappointment in the UK ($679,000, 9th place), where he is more of a known commodity, and we perhaps expect more from Hollywood\u2019s most flamboyant comeback man. As ever, an aura of uncertainty surrounds Downey Jr: older film-goers know he can act, but the younger, multiplex-frequenting crowd have only seen him wisecrack. Perhaps this demographic dislocation accounts for why, post-rehab, he\u2019s always been paired with another star (like Jake Gyllenhaal in 2007\u2019s Zodiac and Jamie Foxx in 2009\u2019s The Soloist) in straighter projects. The Judge doesn\u2019t look like it will clear things up. The rest of the world     Breakup Buddies Photograph: PR    Adding another $10.1m this weekend to reach $165m and 13th place globally, Ning Hao\u2019s comedy Breakup Buddies monster hit continues to power towards the $208m it needs to become the most successful Chinese film ever. In 15th place, French urban comedy Samba opened softly ($4.5m) in that country, well short of directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano\u2019s 2011 phenomenon Intouchables ($14.5m). That film saw an extraordinary second-week bounce (+57%), so Samba has its work cut out if lightning is to strike twice. Also notable and new, in 18th, is Mexican corruption satire The Perfect Dictatorship, which snatched the No 1 spot in that country from Fox\u2019s $50m-budgeted, Latin-orientated animation The Book of Life \u2013 though the kids\u2019 film is expected to pick up strongly during the Day of the Dead holiday (and is doing just fine elsewhere). The Hrithik Roshan barnstormer Bang Bang! has fallen off the global list, but it\u2019s worth flagging up that it\u2019s now the No 2 Bollywood release in India of 2014, behind Salman Khan\u2019s action-thriller Kick, and Bollywood\u2019s sixth highest grossing worldwide ever. \u201cSuper-hit!\u201d, in Indian box-office reporting parlance. Its $50m global take doesn\u2019t sound huge \u2013 but if admissions figures were available, I suspect the story would be very different. The future             Fury will be going on the offensive in 25 more markets, including the UK, but in the States it will have Keanu Reeves\u2019 revenge thriller John Wick to contend with. Annabelle - apparently keeping admirable pace with its parent film The Conjuring at the same point in its run last year - continues to roll out, as does The Judge. In India it\u2019s Diwali, and Shah Rukh Khan has rigged up $24m blockbuster Happy New Year \u2013 prime masala frippery about a diamond heist sprung under the guise of a dance competition \u2013 for the occasion. Producers Yash Raj are releasing simultaneously in the UK, US, Holland, France, Pakistan, UAE, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 as close to a worldwide rollout as Bollywood gets. And Disney\u2019s interesting-looking culture-chimera animation Big Hero 6 starts a five-month release schedule in Russia next week. Set in the pagoda-skyscrapered metropolis of \u201cSan Fransokyo\u201d, I wonder if Asian-inflected milieus like this are really box-office catnip in the east, or if they\u2019re just there for western audiences eager for an exotic kick?

The tragedy prompted the BBC\u2019s Michael Buerk to describe it as \u201ca biblical famine in the 20th century\u201d and \u201cthe closest thing to hell on Earth\u201d. In sharp contrast with that devastating poverty, Ethiopia is now widely considered to be one of a pack of \u201cAfrican tigers\u201d, with ambitious plans to become a middle-income country by 2025. The nation has, \u201clike the proverbial phoenix, managed to rise from the ashes to become Africa\u2019s fastest-growing non-energy-driven economy\u201d, a senior tax adviser at KPMG Kenya recently noted. The changes that have taken place in Ethiopia since the 1984 famine are commendable. Despite some dispute over the figures, there is consensus that Ethiopia has registered impressive economic growth for the past decade of somewhere between 8% and 10%. One effect of the progress is a greater capacity to cope with drought, preventing the descent into famine conditions that have occurred in the past. Ethiopia\u2019s development efforts are also praised internationally for meeting some of the millennium development goals, particularly universal primary education and a reduction in infant mortality. The government\u2019s investments, the main engine of growth, abound, from building a road network to expanding basic social services, and making a big push in the energy sector. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Blue Nile, an impressive, self-funded hydropower project heralding the country\u2019s rebirth, will be the continent\u2019s largest upon its completion in 2017. Changes are equally visible in trade and investment. Exports have diversified and the country has become a major shipper of oil seeds, flowers, gold and, increasingly, textiles and leather products. This has been enabled by a steady growth in foreign investment, particularly into floriculture and manufacturing. It is indeed astonishing to see Ethiopia fast becoming a popular destination for global giants such as Chinese shoemaker Huajian and H&amp;M, the world\u2019s second-biggest clothing retailer. The spectacular change in Ethiopia has been enabled by the relative peace and stability it has enjoyed over the past two decades, which in turn has allowed its regional diplomatic influence to increase. Although there are still low-level insurgencies in some parts of the country, the ruling coalition has generally governed effectively. This has been buttressed by its allocation of more than 60% of the national budget to sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, education and health, that favour poorer people. Its predecessor spent most of the treasury\u2019s coffers on the military. Ethiopia\u2019s big push, like previous surges by the \u201cAsian tigers\u201d, also has costs that cast doubt on its sustainability. Although the government labels it a \u201cdemocratic developmental state\u201d, the political-economic order that the ruling Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front follows resembles those Asian models, which delivered rapid economic growth in an authoritarian environment. Yet unlike nations such as Singapore and China, whose economic transformation occurred within a closed political system, the EPRDF operates in what is formally a liberal democracy. This ideological entanglement has created structural tension, evident in the restrictions on political and civil rights that are, in theory, enshrined in the constitution. Growing economic inequality also threatens to undermine the political stability and popular legitimacy that a developmental state acutely needs. Who benefits from economic growth is a much-contested issue in contemporary Ethiopia. Although the government argues that the suffering caused by rapidly rising living costs is a transient phenomenon inherent in developing economies, the emergence of new economic elites through rentier activity and clientelism has exacerbated the sense of relative deprivation, particularly among urban poor people. Additionally, Ethiopia\u2019s economic ambition has a cost for sections of its huge rural population. The country\u2019s five-year growth and transformation plan, begun in 2010, includes tapping into the \u201cabundant extensive land\u201d in the lowlands for large-scale commercial agriculture. These peripheral areas - such as South Omo and the Afar region - are where ethnic minorities with a weaker political voice live. The government\u2019s policy of urging these communities to shift away from livelihoods such as pastoralism to sedentary farming, while incentivising foreigners to invest in the same areas raises human rights issues, such as the right to choose a lifestyle and livelihood strategy which are included in the country\u2019s constitution. These are particularly controversial in Ethiopia\u2019s new federal political order, which claims to ensure ethno-cultural justice. Whether Ethiopia will attain its ambitious goal of becoming a middle-income country in the next decade depends how it manages the transition from public investment-driven growth to a dynamic, private sector-heavy model. It will also hinge upon its attempts to mitigate the many political and social costs of the transition. Notwithstanding these challenges, it has already been a long, arduous and successful journey from a land of \u201cbiblical famine\u201d to one of the brightest economies in Africa. \u2022 Dereje Feyissa Dori is the Africa research director at the International Law and Policy Institute, a research fellow of the Alexander Von Humboldt Foundation and adjunct associate professor at the College of Law and Governance, Addis Ababa University"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2014/oct/23/national-report-fake-stories", "sentences": ["Researchers at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore have come up with the best solution yet - a lithium ion battery that charges to 70% in just two minutes."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-23T06:30:00Z", "title": "Boot up: fake news sites, Apple Pay glitches, Xiaomi shifts data location", "tags": ["Technology", "Microsoft", "Apple", "Google", "Xiaomi"], "article": "A burst of 10 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Fake news sites are using Facebook to spread Ebola panic &gt;&gt; The Verge  here&apos;s a scary story bouncing around Facebook, accruing hundreds of thousands of likes: the small town of Purdon, Texas, has been quarantined after a family of five was diagnosed with Ebola.

Bank of America refunds duplicate Apple Pay charges &gt;&gt; Cult of Mac  [Samuel] Burke [at CNN] reports that he eventually got the charges refunded once Bank of America noticed\u00a0they were obviously duplicate charges of the same amount. Other customers haven&apos;t had as easy time getting a refund, but Bank of America says they&apos;re aware of the issue and working on a fix. Bank of America representative Tara Burke told Cult of Mac, &quot;We apologize for this inconvenience. We&apos;re correcting this issue immediately.&quot; She also reassured us that &quot;all duplicates will be refunded&quot; to Apple Pay customers. Apple Pay launched on Monday with the release of iOS 8.1, allowing iPhone 6 and 6 Plus users to pay for items at brick and mortar stores by tapping their device to an NFC terminal. The launch wasn&apos;t without its glitches, as some of the Apple Pay supporting apps had problems processing payments.  Problem apparently limited to Bank of America - but it&apos;s the sort of problem that can kill a system if it isn&apos;t figured out quickly.  Trim Enabler and Yosemite &gt;&gt; Cindori Trim Enabler was a useful app to enable third-party SSDs on Macs using older versions of Mac OS X. But:   In OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), Apple has introduced a new security requirement called kext signing. (A kext is a kernel extension, or a driver, in Mac OS X) Kext signing basically works by checking if all the drivers in the system are unaltered by a third party, or approved by Apple. If they have been modified, Yosemite will no longer load the driver. This is a means of enforcing security, but also a way for Apple to control what hardware that third party developers can release OS X support for. Since Trim Enabler works by unlocking the Trim driver for 3rd party SSD&apos;s, this security setting prevents Trim Enabler to enable Trim on Yosemite.  Not good news if you&apos;ve got a third-party SSD drive - which has for years been one of the best ways to &quot;refresh&quot; an older machine. Beware. Sony looking to cut smartphone sales target again &gt;&gt; WSJ Takashi Mochizuki:   Sony is considering slashing its smartphone sales target again, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday, as the business struggles to perform as expected in the face of fierce competition especially in emerging markets. The Japanese electronics giant is likely to trim its smartphone sales target by several millions of units from the current goal of 43m for the 12 months to the end of March 2015. A lowering of the sales target would be the second downward revision of the forecast in the current business year started in April. The original goal was 50m, which many analysts said was too optimistic\u2026 The planned move stems from Sony&apos;s plan to reduce its presence in some markets, especially emerging nations such as China, by pulling its entry-level handsets.  The problem then becomes whether it can maintain sufficient scale at a high enough selling price to make the business worth continuing with. The writedown in September was of the mobile unit&apos;s estimated profit over its lifetime. Cutting sales forecasts is a lot more urgent.

Is it better? &gt;&gt; Asymco  Third party media (music and videos) storage and playback\u00a0used to be the main job that storage was hired to do but as cameras got better, user-generated content suddenly bellied up to the bar. That is now the story for phones, which are gobbling up all the storage and bandwidth we can throw at them. But what about the larger form factors? Are iPads (and laptops) growing in their demands? Paradoxically, it would seem that the smaller devices are hungrier than their larger cousins. The answer lies\u00a0with the jobs to be done. If highly portable devices are more usable, they will be used more. Large devices are left behind, literally, because their jobs are not as pervasive in place and time. For a large screen like the iPad to increase its\u00a0attractiveness, it has to be the stage for a set of jobs that only it can perform.  Apple Pay: seamless in stores, but quirky online &gt;&gt; NYTimes.com  After I used Apple Pay for a day of shopping in stores, a few things became clear: The new payment system is convenient, problem-free and even fun. The same can&apos;t be said for using Apple Pay to shop via apps on my phone or tablet. That system has lots of room for improvement. It&apos;s limited, still buggy and seemed to result in multiple charges for some purchases \u2014 at least on day 1.  Uber and Instacart were both buggy online, though they say they&apos;ll figure it out. Neither Amazon nor eBay is in for the service online; how long will they be able to hold out?

The electronics manufacturer started experimenting with indoor farming in July 2014 to test the feasibility of using its technology to solve a global problem. \u201cUtilising our expertise in engineering, manufacturing and factory automation, Panasonic is able to grow high-quality produce and stabilise food supply, fulfilling a global market need,\u201d explains Fizzah Rahman, corporate communications executive for Panasonic Asia Pacific.  The farm, which measures just 248 square metres, produces 3.6 tonnes of leafy greens, herbs and vegetables per year. Panasonic is one of several high-tech companies allocating resources to agricultural applications. Their contributions extend beyond developing new technologies; many are also operating onsite indoor farms.     Panasonic indoor vegetable farm. Photograph: Panasonic Asia Pacific    Toshiba started cultivating greens like spinach, lettuce and sprouts in an idle factory in Japan earlier this year. The indoor farm uses fluorescent lighting, temperature controls and remote monitoring systems to track growth. Vegetables will be sold through supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants and Toshiba estimates annual sales will reach 300m yen (approximately \u00a31.74m).  In 2013, Sharp Corporation launched an indoor strawberry-growing operation in Dubai using proprietary technology to manage air quality, temperature and humidity with the goal of managing the farmer-less farm remotely from its headquarters in Japan. After Fujitsu ceased semiconductor manufacturing at its plant in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, in 2009, the international IT services provider decided to leverage its Akisai cloud platform (designed to allow remote crop monitoring) to make its first foray into vegetable production. The corporation harvests 3,500 heads of lettuce per day in the 2,000 square metre former cleanroom. The controlled conditions improve the shelf life of the lettuce and, according to Fujitsu spokesperson Rishad Marquardt, also have a positive impact on the flavour. \u201cThe lettuce is unique in terms of flavour, not bitter like ordinary lettuce,\u201d he claims. Despite the investments associated with launching a high-tech indoor farm (Panasonic, for example, expects to spend an estimated \u00a31.46m by the 2016 financial year to reach its 1,000-tonne production capacity), the consumer cost of factory-grown foods is similar to farm-raised produce and there are significant environmental benefits to high-tech production methods. With the help of efficient lighting, temperature control and computer monitoring, produce grown in indoor farms maintains its nutritional value while using up to 98% less water and 70% less fertiliser than traditional farms and no pesticides, according to the Association for Vertical Farming. (Maintaining a bacteria-free, pesticide-free atmosphere means \u201cfarmers\u201d are often required to wear cleanroom suits and masks to minimise the risk of contamination).     Fujitsu indoor farm. Photograph: Fujitsu    \u201cGrowing lettuce in this environment \u2026 leads to an extremely clean product that can be eaten straight out of the bag without needing to be washed,\u201d Marquardt says. It also allows vegetables to grow up to two-and-a-half times faster than conventional farming. In Japan, Mirai Inc operates an indoor farm in a former Sony semiconductor factory that uses LED lighting developed by General Electric to maximise plant growth. The farm has only been in operation a few months but already cultivates up to 10,000 heads of lettuce per day. The lighting used in the indoor farm, believed to be the largest in the world, uses 40% less energy than fluorescent lamps, according to Kimura Tomoaki, general manager of GE Lighting Japan. While electronics corporations have big plans to contribute to food security in their countries and around the world \u2013 Panasonic set a goal of producing 5% of locally produced vegetables by 2017 \u2013 applying technology to farming is also proving to be good for business. Toshiba hopes to offer retail sales of its equipment for plant factory applications and GE is partnering with Mirai to provide lighting for indoor farms in Russia and China. Panasonic plans to franchise its technology to existing conventional farms that want to experiment with indoor farming; their goal is to make the \u201ctotal agricultural solution\u201d available to the market by 2017. \u201cFrom a management perspective, we foresee this business to be a potential growth portfolio,\u201d says Rahman.

Scuttlebutt: Microsoft was once very close to buying LinkedIn for a couple billion dollars &gt;&gt; Business Insider Nicholas Carlson:   Here&apos;s some fun scuttlebutt we heard this week. In the years before LinkedIn&apos;s 2011 IPO, Microsoft entered into talks to buy LinkedIn several times. At one point the deal was close to happening for around $500m. Microsoft&apos;s last offer, in the months before LinkedIn&apos;s IPO, was somewhere close to $2bn. We&apos;re told Microsoft&apos;s (now departed) deal whiz Hank Vigil thought that was a price too dear, and refused to pull the trigger.  Microsoft declined to comment; LinkedIn said &quot;oh, that.&quot; What would Microsoft have done with LinkedIn, though? Analyst: Why Apple Pay won&apos;t work &gt;&gt; America&apos;s Markets  Apple Pay contains a variety of major shortcomings that will likely limit its ability to be the dominant form of payment in the future, according to a UBS note released to clients this week by analyst Steven Milunovich, quoting payments expert Richard Crone at Crone Consulting. The problems with Apple Pay stem from technical shortcomings of the system relative to other alternatives and the large fees Apple plans to charge, which banks will be eager to escape, the report says. \u2026many banks jumped initially on the Apple Pay bandwagon at launch. But banks are likely to build their own apps using more modern technology with clearer benefits for merchants and security for consumers over the next year to three years, the report says.  Published 7 October. That&apos;s, what, two weeks ago. Let&apos;s see how those apps go over the next few years. Google self-driving car: It may never actually happen &gt;&gt; Slate Lee Gomes (who has written repeatedly about the self-driving cars:   Another problem with maps is that once you make them, you have to keep them up to date, a challenge Google says it hasn&apos;t yet started working on. Considering all the traffic signals, stop signs, lane markings, and crosswalks that get added or removed every day throughout the country, keeping a gigantic database of maps current is vastly difficult. Safety is at stake here; Chris Urmson, director of the Google car team, told me that if the car came across a traffic signal not on its map, it could potentially run a red light, simply because it wouldn&apos;t know to look for the signal. Urmson added, however, that an unmapped traffic signal would be &quot;very unlikely,&quot; because during the &quot;time and construction&quot; needed to build a traffic signal, there would be adequate opportunity to add it to the map. But not always. Scott Heydt, director of marketing at Horizon Signal Technologies, says his company routinely sets up its portable traffic signals at road construction sites. Frequently, they are simply towed to a site and turned on. &quot;We just set one up like that in New Jersey,&quot; said Heydt. &quot;You can be driving to work and everything is normal, but on your way home, discover a new traffic light.&quot; (Of this possibility, a Google spokesperson said, &quot;We will have to be ready for that.&quot;)  Samsung, TSMC Solid State Lighting reportedly to quit LED lighting business, say Taiwan makers &gt;&gt; Digitimes  Samsung Electronics will reportedly withdraw from the global LED lighting market due to low-price pressure from China-based makers, while Taiwan-based TSMC Solid State Lighting will reportedly cease operations, according to industry sources. As Samsung is at a disadvantage in terms of technology and patents compared to Japan-based Nichia, and has relied on low quotes to compete, the sources said. However, China-based makers, by virtue of government subsidies for production equipment, have offered even lower quotes to compete with South Korea-based makers including Samsung, the sources indicated.  Software is eating the world, but Shenzhen is eating the world of hardware. Google plans to make a component store for its modular phone &gt;&gt; Engadget  While speaking at a Purdue University event, Google&apos;s Paul Eremenko, director of Project Ara, recently revealed that the company will be taking a cue from the Play store to create a similar shopping experience for its modular smartphone. What this means, essentially, is you&apos;d be able to buy or sell different components from a single hub, just as is the case now with apps, music, books and more on Google Play - and it would also include reviews and recommendations.  At a guess, Ara isn&apos;t going to end up as a phone project at all, but something more like Arduino or Rasberry Pi - a playground for hacking things together. The talk is here. Android in pieces &gt;&gt; Jana Mobile Looking at Android use in developing countries, particularly Asia (excluding China):   Worldwide, over 70% of traffic to the mCent app comes from just 20 manufacturers.\u00a0Of the approximately 1,300 device models that make up the user base of the mCent app, 41% are Samsung devices, 7% Motorola, and 7% Sony. Far from being enormously fractured, the Android ecosystem \u2013 even in emerging markets where homegrown, low-cost devices are popular- is fairly uniform. Over half the devices used to access the mCent app for Android are accounted for by the 50 most popular smartphones. Although this may look like a fragmentation problem, these 50 devices come from just 12 manufacturers: 52% are Samsung, 12% are Sony, and 12% Micromax (demonstrating mCent&apos;s popularity in India).  The screen resolutions are quite a surprise.

Driverless cars in Singapore&apos;s Chinese and Japanese Gardens &gt;&gt; Tech In Asia  Stroll down the Chinese and Japanese Gardens, and you&apos;d be able to see driverless buggies cruising down the paths at a leisurely 10km/h. These vehicles, which ferry passengers around free-of-charge, is part of a trial by researchers and engineers from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART) and the National University of Singapore (NUS). The experiment will last from October 23 to November 1 from 8am to 2pm. It will resume again after an evaluation. Visitors to the gardens can book a ride through this website. This is the first time two driverless vehicles have been unleashed for public use. Having two robot buggies in the vicinity also makes things interesting: vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Indeed, the two buggies can talk to one another and figure out ways to move passengers more efficiently.  You can follow Guardian Technology&apos;s linkbucket on Pinboard This is the last Boot Up I&apos;ll be doing, so I thought I&apos;d look back on where it came from. The very first &quot;Newsbucket&quot; (here&apos;s the series link) appeared on 25 September 2007, by Jemima Kiss, entitled &quot;PDA&apos;s Newsbucket&quot;. It was a collection of eight links, with very brief commentary. The links came via Del.icio.us. It was part of the Guardian&apos;s &quot;Media&quot; section, rather than Technology. The idea of the &quot;Newsbucket&quot; was to collect links from all over the web that might be interesting, but didn&apos;t merit a separate story in their own right, or where they offered background information. It&apos;s a place for all the things that you might want to store. Around March 2010, we decided to introduce the &quot;Technology newsbucket&quot; - aiming to be the same thing as the PDA version, but housed in &quot;Technology&quot;. The first appeared on 29 March 2010, and had 11 links - including one about &quot;Why the iPad will change everything&quot;, by arch Apple-sceptic Dan Lyons. \u2022 To collect the links, we first used Delicious, and then (after Delicious morphed from a bookmark service into something indescribable, with a flaky API) Pinboard\u2022 a PHP script I wrote queried Delicious/Pinboard and formatted the links, and output them on a web page;\u2022 the output of the script was put into our content management system. This worked well, and is still how it&apos;s done. I also now use an app called Fake to fill out fields in the CMS, speeding the process further. There was only one problem with calling it &quot;Technology newsbucket&quot;: it didn&apos;t leave much room for the rest of the headline. People like to know what they&apos;re going to read about, even if only approximately.  It took us a year to realise this, but once we did, action was swift. After nearly five minutes of discussion, the decision was made to shorten its name to &quot;Boot up&quot;, because it was meant to start the day, when you&apos;d boot up your.. anyhow.  The first post with that prefix appeared on 18 March 2011, when it attracted a grand total of three comments. The Boot Up blogpost has run more or less continuously every weekday since then, garnering a consistent number of page views most days. It&apos;s rarely the most-read, but it&apos;s been a resource you could rely on. It&apos;s been a fun ride, and I&apos;d like to thank readers, and especially the many commenters for the insightful and helpful additions to the day - the links, shared experiences, discussions, and calming voices brought to exchanges before they got out of hand.

Five or six guests are sat around a restaurant table waiting to share fermented mare\u2019s milk with you to celebrate the closing of an important business deal. It\u2019s a scenario ripe with possibilities for cultural cock-ups and etiquette faux pas, which entrepreneur Will Tindall recalls only too well. Refusing to down your fair share of the toe-curling concoction, famed for being the tipple of choice of Genghis Khan and his troops, will not only be socially embarrassing, it could cost you the deal you\u2019ve been working for months to broker. \u201cIf you were to not drink it or have any sort of reaction to that initial taste, it would definitely lower your standing within a meeting,\u201d says Tindall, co-founder of Emerging Crowd. \u201cAnd you\u2019re very much expected to have a shot each time someone has spoken.\u201d Of course, it\u2019s very hard to keep your head after 15 shots of fiery alcohol, and Tindall says even after living and doing business in the country for more than a year he left the meeting without a clue what had been said or what had actually happened. Any SME owner serious about exporting overseas, however, should be prepared for a culture clash or two, particularly in emerging markets unfamiliar with western customs. Tindall says he has a weighty portfolio of embarrassing blunders made during his last six years living and working in Asia. But despite becoming fairly accustomed to the rituals of business meetings in Hong Kong and Singapore, he says nothing could prepare him for Tokyo. Tindall remembers his first meeting in the Japanese capital 10 years ago, with a very senior and well known individual in an international bank. He was told to give a little bow upon taking the man\u2019s business card and it seemed all was going well. That was until he began to make notes about who the person was on the card. \u201cAt that point I saw this guy\u2019s face change to a very strange shade of red. My actions went down incredibly badly. Although I was giving this business card lots of respect, the idea of writing on it was definitely frowned upon. When I went to leave and try to shake his hand, he turned his back on me. It was embarrassing but then I quickly realised that was also because they don\u2019t really shake hands.\u201d It may have been awkward, but it taught him a valuable lesson about Japan\u2019s reverence for the mighty business card. They are incredibly important in Japan, Tindall says. If you are doing business there and have a card which is also translated on the other side, you will receive immediate kudos from the recipient. They love the extra effort that you go to, he adds, but warns to make sure you know which way up the Japanese language side is facing. Handing someone an upside down card is also considered rude. Thankfully, most hosts will be sympathetic to your cultural ignorance, providing you make the effort. Having the ability to laugh at yourself if you make a mistake and apologising is key to recovering from a particularly awkward blunder, he says. For Louis Barnett, the founder of Louis Barnett Chocolates, the biggest hurdle was understanding that in some countries doing business is as much a personal event as it is professional. The 22-year-old entrepreneur, who started his British chocolate company at the tender age of 12, was initially flummoxed by the reaction to his typically hard-nosed business talk. After expressing his professional concern about a matter and sticking to the cold hard facts in a meeting with his partners in Mexico, he was surprised that the reaction was one of offence. By neglecting to ask the client about his personal life \u2013 his wife and kids \u2013 he had inadvertently antagonised his hosts. Because overseas clients will be as unprepared for your way of doing business as you are for theirs, it is crucial you do your homework first and get one step ahead before meeting in person. Barnett found help and support from the British Chambers of Commerce, who have experts on the ground with an understanding of the culture of that nation and the ways UK exporters may have to adapt to doing business there. The chambers, he explains, has a wide reaching spider web of networks and contacts, from buyers and distributors to lawyers, who will help you understand the country\u2019s market. Bulldog Skincare is already a reputable brand of male grooming products in the UK, but it is fast becoming equally well known abroad, with around 14,000 retailers stocking the product range across 13 countries. Its founder, Simon Duffy, first dipped his toe in the overseas market in 2010 with a lucrative deal in Sweden. After the company\u2019s success in Scandinavia, Bulldog had the confidence to throw its net wider, branching out to as far as the US and Australia. One of their most interesting exporting experiences was breaking into the South Korean market. He hesitates to call it a challenge though, despite the vast cultural differences. He claims with thorough research and preparation, any exporting venture is totally manageable \u2013 you just have to be sensitive to the differences. Duffy recommends ediplomat.com, which features a helpful section about cultural conventions, such as how to meet and greet people, as well as information about names, titles, and even acceptable body language such crossing your legs, eye contact and showing the soles of your feet. \u201cCertain conventions which are encouraged in the west can come across as confrontational in Korea,\u201d Duffy explains. \u201cOne of the things we tried to avoid was phrasing questions that required a yes or no answer, as Koreans try to avoid the latter. The negotiation process has a completely different rhythm. Things take longer to be resolved but that isn\u2019t a sign of a lack of momentum \u2013 you have to be prepared for several visits to build trust.\u201d Once that rapport is built, however, then collaboration will become easier. Duffy adds that because they are making the best efforts to do the right thing, their partners are also cutting them a lot of slack. \u201cThey are meeting us in the middle now which is important and we value that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are very conscious that we don\u2019t want to offend the local sensibilities but we are aware that they are reaching out to us and finding common ground.\u201d Read more like this Accidental exporters: the businesses that fell into selling overseas Exporting food to the world\u2019s British expat community This content has been sponsored by UPS, whose brand it displays.

Check into colonial-style Bambu Hotel (doubles from $90) in the centre or for a village experience try the Khmer wooden houses at Maisons Wat Kor (doubles from $94) in Wat Kor village. Battambang\u2019s protected heritage quarter is home to 800 significant buildings, including a 150-year old Chinese temple, charming shop-houses, elegant colonial French buildings, glittering pagodas and striking modernist buildings from the New Khmer Architecture movement. Battambang Bike offers architecture and art-themed cycle tours ($20) and village bike rides and also rents bicycles.

Photograph: Claire Knox for the Guardian    Thanks to the 20-year old Phare Ponleau Selpak performing arts and visual arts school, which has a circus department and big top (shows Monday and Thursday 7pm, one hour, $8), there\u2019s a flourishing arts scene. Galleries and art spaces that can be browsed include Make Maek, Lotus Bar and Gallery and Sammaki on Street 2\u00bd, Studio Art Battambang on Street 1\u00bd, and BCi Battambang opposite the Royal Hotel. Battambang is Cambodia\u2019s rice bowl and boasts the country\u2019s finest food. Visit Phsar Boeung Choeuk market to see fresh local produce. Try noodles and dumplings handmade to order at Lan Chov Khorko Miteanh (145 Street 2) or dine on pan-Asian cuisine at stylish Jaan Bai (Street 2), a social enterprise restaurant and bar that trains and employs disadvantaged kids, with a menu by Asia\u2019s best chef, David Thompson of Nahm Bangkok. At sunset, stalls set up around Phsar Nath market to sell soups, curries and barbecue meats. Battambang Resort runs a fantastic snack tour (from $7) to sample street food at riverside stalls and eateries. You can hire a tuk-tuk for around \u00a39 a day, or \u00a36 half a day, and take an excursion into the lush countryside to see artisanal producers make incense, cotton kramas (traditional Cambodian checked scarves), rice paper, noodles, and rice wine. En route visit Angkorian-era temples such as crowd-free Ek Phnom and Wat Banan, and Mount Sampeau, site of the Killing Caves, where the Khmer Rouge dumped its victims bodies; at dusk watch millions of bats emerge for a cave. Asia-based Backyard Travel has a three-day Beyond Angkor: Battambang and its Countryside tour, taking in many of these experiences, which departs from Siem Reap and costs $469pp all-inclusive. Phnom Penh From Battambang, there are some 20 buses a day to Phnom Penh (six hours, longer during the monsoon, about \u00a34). Use our Phnom Penh in three days holiday itinerary to make the most of your time in the cosmopolitan capital, and our Top 10 hotels, hostels and B&amp;Bs in Phnom Penh for our recommendations for where to stay.

Photograph: Look, die Bildagentur der Fotografen/Alamy    The cooler eastern provinces of Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri are home to lazy rivers, rubber plantations, rolling hills, forested mountains, impressive waterfalls and endangered wildlife. Kompong Cham and KratieThe provincial capital, Kompong Cham, is on the Mekong and 75 miles northeast of Phnom Penh, is an easy bus ride (2\u00bd hours, around \u00a33) from the capital. It makes for a relaxing stop for a riverside walk, a bike ride over a bamboo bridge to Koh Paen island, or a sunset cruise (\u00a36). Most travellers make a beeline for Kratie by bus (three hours from Kompong Cham, \u00a33; five hours from Phnom Penh, \u00a37), also located on the Mekong. Stay at friendly Le Tonl\u00e9 Tourism Training Center (doubles from $10) in Kratie, which trains underprivileged youths, or a traditional Khmer timber house at Rajabori Villas (doubles from $60) on idyllic Koh Trong island, home to a Vietnamese floating village. Rich in French colonial architecture, Kratie is a pleasant place to kick back. The main attraction, however, is the endangered freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins that can be seen 10 miles north of town. Take a moto (\u00a33) or remork (\u00a36), then a boat (\u00a35). Stung Treng and Ban LungTwo and a half hours from Kratie by bus, Stung Treng is another laidback riverside town that makes a good base for seeing the Irrawaddy dolphins from the villages of O\u2019Svay and Preah Rumkel, where wetlands are rich in birdlife. A further two and half hours away by bus, Ban Lung is a base for various activities, including kayaking, mountain biking, trekking in Virachey national park to see some of Cambodia\u2019s last remaining virgin forest, visits to ethnic minority villages, and swimming at Boeng Yeak Lom, a vivid blue crater lake. You can walk through the forest with elephants at the Elephant Valley Project  (full day $85, including transport and lunch), which adopts mistreated Asian elephants, or do an overnight trek to see wild, rare northern yellow-cheeked gibbons in the Veun Sai-Pang Conservation Area with  from \u00a3$199 per person. Set in luxuriant gardens, lakeside Terres Rouges Lodge (doubles from $58) is furnished with Cambodian antiques; while budget-friendly Treetop Ecolodge (doubles $12) has rustic bungalows and sweeping valley vistas. The Vietnam border is two hours by mini-bus from Ban Lung ,or it\u2019s an 11-hour bus ride back to Phnom Penh. Beaches and islands     The island of Koh Rong, southern Cambodia.

See our Top 10 beach hotels and bungalows in Cambodia for places to stay, from stylish resorts to rustic bungalows. Sihanoukville and islandsFour hours from Phnom Penh by bus, Sihanoukville is the largest and most developed town, which is why you should make a beeline for Ream national park, 10 miles east, for jungle walks, mountain treks, mango cruises, birdwatching, dolphin spotting (from December to April), and snorkelling on the islands of Koh Thmei and Koh Seh. Of Sihanoukville\u2019s beaches, busy Occheuteal boasts laidback bars; Serendipity is more mellow and romantic, though transforms into party central at night; and Otres is the most relaxed. If you\u2019re looking to do more than work on your tan, there\u2019s sailing, diving, snorkelling, kitesurfing, windsurfing, kayaking, paddle boarding, and surfing (Otres, from May to October). Kampot and Kep From Sihanoukville, mini buses regularly trundle east to atmospheric riverside Kampot (1\u00bd hours), best known for producing the world\u2019s best pepper. In the old French Quarter, check into La Java Bleue (doubles from $55) in a colonial building with balconies; Rikitkitavi (doubles from $48) in a renovated barn on River Road; or The Columns (doubles from $45) in a row of charming shop-houses. After taking in the colonial architecture and ambling along the waterfront, take an excursion to Bokor national park and its eerie abandoned French hill station (entry \u00a39, tours from \u00a315), cave temples in the limestone hills of Phnom Chhnork and Phnom Sorsia, and a pepper farm. Starling Farm, an organic pepper plantation, has beautiful wooden villas and bungalows at their new Starling Ridge Plantation Resort http://starlingridge.com (from $30) . With little else to do other than soak up the sun and feast on fresh seafood at the crab market, seaside Kep, on a peninsula 45 minutes from Kampot, is the perfect spot to end a trip to Cambodia. A retreat for French colonials in the early 20th century and a playground for Cambodia\u2019s royalty and rich in the 1960s, the area is dotted with faded shells of modernist villas, abandoned when the Khmer Rouge arrived. Offshore, Koh Tonsay or Rabbit Island (25 minutes; public boat from \u00a38, private boat from \u00a318) has empty beaches and excellent snorkelling. Inland, lofty Kep national park has trails to hike and bike. If a hillside resort with pool and panoramic ocean views appeals, try the highest, Le Bout du Monde (doubles from $45), which has stone and timber Khmer-style villas with verandas and hammocks, while The Vine Retreat (doubles from $35), an on organic farm, offers yoga, meditation, free bicycles and tours to a weaving centre. Back down by the water, don\u2019t miss sundowners overlooking the sea at the Sailing Club. From Kep, there are buses to the Vietnamese border and the riverside town of Ha Tien (1\u00bd hours), part of a special economic zone, allowing visa-free travel for 15 days. If you want to ventrue further into Vietnam you need to return to Phonm Penh (buses to Ho Chi Minh Cit, five hours, \u00a310). ."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2014/oct/28/-sp-plant-crime-of-the-century", "sentences": ["In the summer of 1876, Kew paid \u00a3700 to Henry Wickham for thousands of rubber seeds that he smuggled out of the Amazonian rainforest and were subsequently planted in Singapore and Malaysia."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-28T06:00:04Z", "title": "Why would someone steal the world\u2019s rarest water lily? | Sam Knight", "tags": ["UK news", "Kew Gardens", "Crime", "Science", "Environment"], "article": "The Princess of Wales Conservatory is what staff at Kew Gardens call a honeypot. The world\u2019s largest and most prestigious botanical garden, Kew receives 2 million visitors each year, and a huge proportion of these, perhaps 30,000 a week, make sure they see the conservatory, a large armadillo-like structure near the eastern gates. Built in 1986, the glasshouse has climate controls that allow it to contain 10 plant habitats under a single roof. In the space of a few minutes, visitors can examine ghostly, egg-shaped cacti in the desert cool; tumbling red Passiflora in the heat of the forest; and the fibrous mangroves of a swamp. On any given morning, squads of children, dressed in yellow high-visibility jackets, trek among the lurid, flowering bromeliads and tropical leaves the size of pillowcases, and squeal at beetles that skitter out on to the walkway.   Related: Why would someone steal the world\u2019s rarest water lily? By Sam Knight    Shortly after two o\u2019clock on the afternoon of Thursday, January 9, Nick Johnson, the 43-year-old manager of the conservatory, returned to Kew after spending the morning at a school in east London. Johnson, a trim man with a short beard, had left his team preparing the glasshouse for the gardens\u2019 annual orchid festival. The exhibition is a big deal at Kew. Orchids are the world\u2019s largest group of flowering plants, and their devotees, known as orchidophiles, are among the most eager and best-organised plant enthusiasts. Around 120,000 come to the festival each winter, and a good show, and positive press coverage, can boost visitor numbers at Kew for the rest of the year. The theme for this year was \u201cPlant Hunters\u201d, and Johnson\u2019s staff were dressing half the conservatory to evoke the high romance of Victorian botanical adventuring, a time when avid collectors and the best scientists (there was little distinction between the two) set off for distant jungles armed with cutlasses and a year\u2019s supply of tobacco. The temporary display included a period botanist\u2019s campsite, complete with pith helmets and wicker baskets, and a cascade of fuchsia and cream vandas. It was an unusually warm January day. Johnson couldn\u2019t wait to take off his winter coat. But as soon as he walked into the glasshouse, he ran into Duncan Brokensha, an apprentice on his team. Brokensha was agitated. Amid the festival preparations, he had carried out a routine inspection of the water levels in the ponds. As usual, he had also checked on the rarest, and most endangered, plant in the glasshouse, the Nymphaea thermarum, which is the smallest water lily in the world. Unlike some of the valuable orchids and cacti in the conservatory, which are kept behind glass screens, the tiny water lilies, whose white flowers measure less than 1cm across, were on open display, albeit in a relatively inaccessible position near the foot of a concrete bridge. There were 24 planted out in the mud. Today, Brokensha counted 23 \u2013 and a hole where the 24th had been.  The plant had been stolen. Johnson was furious. Mainly with himself: he had decided, the previous spring, to plant the water lily in the glasshouse. At the time, Kew possessed virtually the entire planet\u2019s population of Nymphaea thermarum. The water lily had not been seen in its only known location in the wild, a thermal hot spring in Rwanda, since 2008, and it was one of around 100 plant species that now only survive in botanical gardens, on the very edge of extinction. Johnson had known the risks of putting such a scarce, and delicate, species on public view. People swipe the occasional flower and cutting from botanical gardens \u2013 they always have.     Nymphaea thermarum, the world\u2019s smallest water lily. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    But Johnson had figured that the plants were safe. Because of their unusual natural habitat, where they grew in a millimetre or two of water, the Nymphaea thermarum were planted in damp soil in the glasshouse, rather than in a pond, like the other water lilies. Johnson had found a spot, tucked down near the water\u2019s edge, that he thought was out of reach. Someone would have to crawl along a railway sleeper, push their way through a surrounding foliage of anthuriums, and then balance precariously over the mud to steal one. Johnson and Brokensha hurried into the tropical rainforest zone. The temperature, as always, was 24C. It struck Johnson that the raid must have been planned. As well as being hard to get at, the Nymphaea thermarum were not flowering in January. Dotting a patch of soil the size of a dining room table, they looked like small, uninteresting cabbages. The thief had shown considerable agility, and nerve, to scramble down there in full view of the other visitors. One of Johnson\u2019s colleagues had been working all morning in an adjacent pond, building an Amazonian jetty, and had seen nothing. But there was no mistaking what had happened. Johnson stood on the bridge and looked down at the hole in the mud. \u201cIt was visibly a hand scoop,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could still see the digits of the fingers, the grooves.\u201d What irked Johnson the most, however, was that he felt he had been warned. A month earlier, he had caught a young man who had strayed into the plant beds. The man, who was French, insisted he had been taking pictures, but his backpack was open, and it was full of plants. Inside, Johnson found a rare Myrmecodia \u2013 a type of south-east Asian plant that forms symbiotic relationships with ants \u2013 that he had grown in Kew\u2019s conservation laboratories a decade earlier. \u201cI was seeing red,\u201d Johnson recalled. He asked the thief what he intended to do with the plants. \u201cRoot them and sell them on the internet,\u201d the man replied. Johnson was taken aback by his brazenness, and the fact that, apart from the Myrmecodia, the bag contained mostly filler \u2013 stuff you could buy from a nursery. The man wasn\u2019t bothered. \u201cOh, people will buy them,\u201d he said. Kew has had its own police force \u2013 a constabulary initially made up of veterans of the Crimean war \u2013 for 150 years. The standard punishment for thieves is to take their plants back, and escort them off the property. The constabulary photographed the Frenchman, and told him never to come back to Kew. But Johnson was unsettled. Over Christmas, he went online and searched for sales of suspicious-looking plants. Using his wife\u2019s eBay account, he messaged a seller in California who was auctioning seeds of the critically endangered St Helena ebony, which Johnson knew should not be on the market. The aim of organisations such as Kew is to ensure that when rare species are sold commercially, the profits are shared with their home countries, to help rebuild habitats. This arrangement, which is carried out under the international convention on biodiversity, is known as \u201cbenefit sharing\u201d, but it only works when trade in the endangered plants is highly controlled. Johnson tried to explain this to the seller. Only two St Helena ebonies are known to remain in the wild. \u201cScrew you,\u201d the seller wrote back. \u201cThis is capitalism.\u201d    The thief had shown considerable agility, and nerve, to scramble down there in full view of the other visitors       Now someone had come for his most precious plant. This time, Johnson made sure the Metropolitan police were called. Besides his personal irritation, the Nymphaea thermarum was of such international importance that its theft had to be publicly recorded. If the stolen plant were to enter the market, or escape into Britain\u2019s waterways, scientists needed to know where it had come from. An alert went out on Kew\u2019s intranet, asking if staff had seen a man with a muddy hand. Two police officers came to the conservatory, and took a statement from Johnson. Staff started talking again about installing CCTV in the grounds and glasshouses, an expensive and dispiriting undertaking that Kew has resisted for years. But even as this full-blown response to the theft took shape, Johnson had mixed feelings. When a police forensics team came to the conservatory, put on their white suits and crawled into the flower beds with magnifying glasses strapped to their heads, he was conscious of the absurdity of the situation. \u201cThis is just ridiculous,\u201d he thought. The water lily was gone. That was that. Johnson\u2019s wariness stemmed from a career spent on the underfunded, under-recognised frontier of wild plant conservation. On the one hand, what you\u2019re doing feels important, vital to the future of the planet. On the other hand, it\u2019s futile: the environment is going to hell. No one else is getting worked up about the future of St Helena ebonies, Nymphaea thermarums and rare ant plants. \u201cWhen you have worked with these collections there is almost an internal dialogue,\u201d Johnson told me. One day, he explained, he might propagate a critically endangered species. \u201cWow, brilliant!\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd then you think to yourself, \u2018Well it\u2019s all bullshit anyway.\u2019 No one is going to do anything about it.\u201d *** Plant crime is an idea whose time is yet to come. There are laws and regulations, it\u2019s true, but most of us don\u2019t really know how to think about it, beyond a vague sense of the comic possibilities. Three days after the theft at Kew, the Met press office tweeted about the incident and newspapers around the world took up the story as a bit of fun. It was like something out of the Pink Panther. The crime was framed like an art heist. The Nymphaea thermarum became \u201cpriceless\u201d. BBC Crimewatch put out an appeal, asking for witnesses. Startled by the attention, Kew used the opportunity to retell the story of the plant\u2019s brush with extinction. The thermal water lily was only successfully grown from seed in 2009, after the last living specimen, which had been in Germany, had died. Its survival was down to Kew\u2019s plant \u201ccodebreaker\u201d, a charismatic Spanish horticultural scientist called Carlos Magdalena. Magdalena gave press interviews for a week straight, waking up at 4am to talk to American television, before going back to sleep, and getting up to speak to more journalists during the day.     Kew Gardens\u2019 plant \u2018codebreaker\u2019 Carlos Magdalena at the Princess of Wales Conservatory. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Magdalena planted his first water lily when he was five years old. It was a Nymphaea alba \u2013 Europe\u2019s standard-issue white water lily \u2013 that he took from a neighbour\u2019s neglected pond. He put it in a small reservoir that his father had built to irrigate the family farm in Asturias, in northern Spain. The plant promptly took over, smothering the surface of the water. \u201cMy father was not so pleased,\u201d he said when we met at the large, tropical glasshouse that is Magdalena\u2019s domain, in a quiet corner of Kew. The scientist has had a fondness for water lilies ever since. \u201cI think there is something quite appealing in a subconscious way of coming out of a dirty pond and challenging the wind and the rain,\u201d he explained. Magdalena, who is 42, and has shoulder-length hair and earrings, speaks about plants with a kind of poetic abandon. \u201cComing out magnificently and smelling beautifully and being totally unaffected by the other crap, isn\u2019t it?\u201d These childhood adventures made it feel somehow personal when Magdalena was struggling to save the Nymphaea thermarum in the autumn of 2009. He had learned of the plant\u2019s existence when he was cataloguing Kew\u2019s tropical water lily collection, and noticed that the gardens did not have it. Then he found out that its habitat had been destroyed, and that nobody at Bonn\u2019s botanical garden, which had the only surviving specimens, knew how to grow it. The world\u2019s smallest water lily was heading for extinction. \u201cI just thought automatically, \u2018I had to have this...\u2019\u201d Magdalena told me. \u201cIt is like the same rule that all gardeners have: What do you want to grow? What you cannot have.\u201d The first batch of Nymphaea thermarum seeds arrived at Kew in July 2009. When I asked Magdalena how long it took him to work out the correct growing conditions for the plant, he was unable to answer in any straightforward way. \u201cIt is very difficult to say how much time I put working on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause perhaps in my dreams, in my REM phase, my brain was still thinking about this bloody water lily.\u201d There is a reason why Magdalena has developed a reputation as someone who is able to grow and save plants that no one else can. \u201cI think obsession in this is key,\u201d he told me. \u201cSometimes it is just like your inquisitive thought which makes it grow.\u201d He finally came to the answer \u2013 that Nymphaea thermarum need more carbon dioxide than other water lilies, because they grow in such shallow water \u2013 while he was cooking pasta one night. The rescue of the thermal water lily was a good news day at Kew. The Nymphaea thermarum was the garden\u2019s pin-up for International Day for Biodiversity, in May 2010. Magdalena was keen to avoid what had happened in Bonn, where a horticulturist had retired without sharing the secret of how to grow the plant, so he publicised details of his work on the internet. Soon, he was getting requests to share the seeds with collectors and hybridisers, who blend different breeds of water lily to make new varieties. \u201cCan I have some? Can I have some? Can I have some?\u201d he recalled. Magdalena sympathised with the requests. \u201cI understand the feeling of I really want to grow this,\u201d he told me. But there was nothing that he could do. Legally moving plants such as Nymphaea thermarum, which are extinct in the wild, requires a lot of bureaucratic legwork and expensive permits under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). Magdalena had other priorities. First he sent seeds to the world\u2019s relevant seedbanks. Then he sent samples of the plant back to Bonn, and trained staff at the botanical garden, to make sure there were at least two populations of the water lily. Magdalena was also keen to explore the plant\u2019s commercial prospects, and he researched a possible \u201cbenefits sharing\u201d scheme that would help fund the restoration of the water lily\u2019s lost habitat in Rwanda.     The Princess of Wales Conservatory at Kew Gardens. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    Collectors and nursery owners continued to beg Magdalena for the plant. \u201cAll the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the time.\u201d He sensed that people were willing to break the rules. \u201cWhen there is no way of getting it, people grow sick and obsessed.\u201d In the summer of 2013, an American hybridiser, Craig Presnell, forwarded a message to Magdalena, in which he had been offered seeds on the black market, from a seller claiming to be in Canada. \u201cI\u2019ve got Nymphaea thermarum,\u201d said the message, \u201cbut they are expensive.\u201d Magdalena worried that seeds might have been stolen from Bonn, or even his secure glasshouse at Kew. When he did finally share the water lily with a trusted grower in Thailand \u2013 under a contract banning its commercial use \u2013 someone photographed the plant with a long lens and the picture turned up on the website of a local nursery, offering Nymphaea thermarum for sale. When the water lily was taken from the Princess of Wales Conservatory, Magdalena wasn\u2019t shocked in the slightest. \u201cWhat surprised me is that it took so long,\u201d he said. *** Not everyone was moved by the theft of the thermal water lily. \u201cGot to say what\u2019s the point,\u201d tweeted Louise Mensch, the former Conservative MP. \u201cOrdinary looking plant hardly worth saving. #Darwin.\u201d Journalists covering the story got in a tangle about whether the plant that had been stolen was the only Nymphaea thermarum left in the world. If it wasn\u2019t, then what was the problem? Kew had seeds, right? They could just grow some more. Why were they trying to keep the plant so securely, anyway? One big problem with plant crime is that it is so difficult to distinguish from the act of botany itself. Many of those who stand tallest in the annals of plant science \u2013 Joseph Dalton Hooker (Kew\u2019s most celebrated director), Andr\u00e9 Michaux (who introduced 5,000 trees to France), Robert Fortune (who brought tea out of China) \u2013 spent years travelling the world and uprooting tens of thousands of plants that they liked the look of. What\u2019s more, they often did so at great personal risk, in a spirit of fevered competition, while defying anyone that tried to stop them. Hooker, who brought home 7,000 species, including 25 new rhododendrons, from a two-year expedition to the Himalayas, was imprisoned by the King of Sikkim. Michaux was thrown out of America as a spy. Fortune fought off Chinese pirates with a shotgun. Even the acts that were recognised at the time as larcenous have rarely been remembered that way. The Dutch tulip industry was more or less founded on the repeated theft of bulbs from the gardens of Carolus Clusius, a botanist in Leiden, in the 1590s. In the summer of 1876, Kew paid \u00a3700 to Henry Wickham for thousands of rubber seeds that he smuggled out of the Amazonian rainforest and were subsequently planted in Singapore and Malaysia. In Brazil, Wickham became known as the pr\u00edncipe dos ladr\u00f5es (prince of thieves) and the carrasco do amazonas (executioner of the Amazon). In 1920, he was knighted by George V for services to the rubber industry. Even today, it\u2019s difficult to convey how exactly plant theft \u2013 or smuggling species in defiance of arcane border controls like Cites \u2013 really matters. Many plant collectors are quick to observe that habitat destruction is by far the biggest threat to the planet\u2019s biota, and there is a striking absence of laws to prevent it. Henry Oakeley, a former president of the Orchid Society of Great Britain, told me that he had recently visited the remains of a forest in the Peruvian Andes that is one of the last known locations of a rare species of Anguloa orchid. \u201cIt was less than 100ft by 300ft and it was being hacked piece by piece to grow maize,\u201d he said. \u201cI would have been put into jail if I had tried to collect anything whatsoever, but the farmer is perfectly entitled to burn it all down.\u201d The fact that the water lily was stolen at Kew did not help either. With the world\u2019s largest living collection of plants, and the heft of a large, publicly-funded institution, the botanical garden has a potent, and not especially beloved, reputation among many enthusiasts. \u201cThe plant thief is just somebody who doesn\u2019t work at Kew,\u201d one told me. I was struck several times, speaking to water lily collectors and hybridisers, that despite a deep interest in the Nymphaea thermarum itself, most were sceptical about how rare the plant really was, and Kew\u2019s own motives in the whole affair. \u201cTheir stories tend to be glorified,\u201d one US water lily dealer told me. Others were gratified that the lily was now out from under Kew\u2019s thumb. \u201cPersonally I have no worries about what has happened,\u201d one British collector said. \u201cI feel there is an arrogance about Kew. They deserved what they got.\u201d Carlos Magdalena told me that he had even been accused of staging the theft to increase publicity for his work. Those who follow the rules can see their deficiencies, and the element of hypocrisy. Nick Johnson, of all people, was aware of the irony of building an exhibition at Kew to 19th-century plant hunters, and then calling the police when one of his prized specimens was pinched. \u201cWe are literally the poacher who has turned into the gamekeeper,\u201d he said. But in a world of invasive species, with more and more endangered plants, when national governments increasingly want to control the intellectual property and revenue streams from their wildlife, botanical gardens have no choice. As well as sticking to the rules, there is also the discernible harm that plant theft does cause. According to the charity Plantlife, which campaigns to protect wild plants in the UK, the crime poses a large but almost completely unrecorded threat to this country\u2019s flora. Trevor Dines, the group\u2019s botanical specialist, told me that plant crime tends to fall into three categories \u2013 the casual picking of wild flowers; the large-scale theft of popular nursery plants; and the targeting of particular plants by obsessive collectors \u2013 and that this third, specialist subset can lead to disproportionate damage. \u201cWhere we get these very rare plants being collected, the impact is very serious,\u201d said Dines. In 2010, thieves helped themselves to radnor lilies (Gagea bohemica) from the last hillside in Wales where the plants remain. In 2000, a hybrid spleenwort fern appeared in the town of Leek, in Staffordshire. It was the first sighting of the plant in the UK for more than a century. It was stolen two weeks later. In this late, degraded chapter in our planet\u2019s conservation, it is possible to see plant theft as part of a general, depressing quickening: as more plants become endangered, because their habitats are destroyed, they become more desirable to collectors, because they are rare, and so on. Around 20% of the world\u2019s 380,000 plant species are now thought to be threatened by extinction, the same proportion as for mammals. (The only order of life in more trouble are the amphibians). We treasure things in the last second before the lights go out. That is certainly the case with the Nymphaea thermarum. The plant was practically unknown in the 20 years between its discovery and near extinction \u2013 until Magdalena and Kew highlighted its fragility. The publicity around the theft has only made it more desirable still. A couple of months after the plant was taken at Kew, two small hybrid water lilies were stolen from the botanical garden at Leiden. They were planted next to a sign about Nymphaea thermarum and are believed to be the victims of mistaken identity. \u201cIt is difficult to explain,\u201d said Eberhard Fischer, the German botanist who discovered the water lily. Fischer was a 25-year-old undergraduate when he spotted the plants on the banks of a hot spring in Rwanda\u2019s western province of Mashyuza in 1987: a carpet of tiny nymphaea. \u201cIt was really amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cI had immediately the idea that this must be something not yet known.\u201d Fischer\u2019s car broke down, and he spent several days camped next to the plants. Since then, he has searched more than 50 hot springs in Congo, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania, looking for the water lilies, and never found them again. In the meantime, the water from the Rwandan spring has been rerouted, draining the area where the water lily grew. Fischer\u2019s concern since the theft is that the stolen plant could make its way on to the open market. From the moment that Magdalena successfully propagated the water lily, both scientists were excited about the Nymphaea thermarum\u2019s commercial potential. Because of its small size, and the fact that it lives in soil, rather than water, they believed it could be sold as a cute, hassle-free \u201cno-water lily\u201d, and any revenues could be used to fund the plant\u2019s return to the wild. \u201cIt becomes a cheap house plant which is much more cool than all the other ones,\u201d said Magdalena when I went to see him at Kew. When I asked him how much he thought it might be worth, he pulled out his iPhone and punched in some numbers. \u201cWhat if I sell 2 million plants worldwide at five quid each? That\u2019s 10 million pounds, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He thought the water lily might do especially well in Japan, where gardeners are fond of miniatures. Before the theft, Magdalena had approached a British nursery, which said it would be willing to place an initial order for 25,000 of the plants from Kew, at \u00a35 each. Restoring the Nymphaea thermarum\u2019s habitat is now in the balance. Fischer, who has discovered more than 300 new plant species, has seen plans for similar benefit sharing schemes get derailed before. In 2008, he found Impatiens nyungwensis, a new kind of balsam in Rwanda, and had the same hopes for it. He shared a cutting with a single colleague. \u201cSuddenly it was on the market,\u201d said Fischer. \u201cSo, ja ... This was really disappointing.\u201d *** It is not easy to solve a plant theft. Richmond police closed their investigation in a matter of weeks. In the UK, the only police agency devoted to such matters is the National Wildlife Crime Unit, which has a staff of 12. Their strategic priorities for this year include \u201cBadger Persecution\u201d, \u201cBat Persecution\u201d and \u201cFreshwater Pearl Mussels Poaching.\u201d Plants don\u2019t make the list. Which is, on the face of it, perfectly sensible. Policing the world\u2019s plants is a nutty idea. There are almost 400,000 species (most biologists acknowledge this is a guess), of which more than 30,000 are already listed under Cites. On a recent wet Monday morning, I drove up the A1 to talk to one of the crime unit\u2019s handful of investigators. I met Alan Roberts in the restaurant of a Premier Inn outside Huntingdon. Like most of the unit, which is officially based in Scotland, he works from home. Bald and calm, Roberts was wearing a fleece. In 2001, he was the wildlife crime officer for Norfolk police, when the last bog orchid (Hammarbya paludosa) was stolen, marking its disappearance from the county. He was sanguine about the low status of wildlife crime \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re up against the terrorism and the drugs and so on and so forth,\u201d he said \u2013 and the fragile state of the unit, which tends to have its funding renewed for 12 months at a time. But Roberts said the team don\u2019t think about that much. They just take the calls as they come in. \u201cWe make things happen.\u201d     Water lilies by Claude Monet. Photograph: The Gallery Collection/Corbis    They are helped by one big factor in wildlife crime: not that many people are into it. \u201cWhere is the item likely to go?\u201d Roberts asked. Unlike a stolen car radio, illicitly taken plants, or smuggled wildlife products, such as bear bile, tend to appeal to narrow communities of dealers and committed consumers. \u201cThese little worlds are very closed worlds and unique in their own way,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cSome of them may even know who\u2019s done it, but don\u2019t actually want to say anything because it might be their friend. But they might be more likely to talk to you than someone who handles car radios.\u201d I asked him why. \u201cBecause they\u2019re not normally criminal. These people haven\u2019t gone through their whole lives progressing from shoplifting to burglary,\u201d said Roberts. \u201cThey\u2019ve done plants. And they just want to prove that they can do something that hasn\u2019t been done elsewhere.\u201d And that is the biggest weakness of the plant thief. The compulsion. The urge. The need to outdo your peers. The fact that you can never stop. Many of the obsessive collectors that Roberts has prosecuted over the years \u2013 egg collectors, reptile collectors, skull collectors \u2013 have followed a recognisable path. \u201cThis hunger for the rarer, the more expensive, the thing they can show off the most about, it forces people into crossing over barriers they know are wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce they have done that once, they will push it a little further, and the slippery slope gets very slippery.\u201d Often, people prosecuted for these kinds of crimes turn out to have committed hundreds of offences, and are convinced they have done nothing wrong. \u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot of people out there who should have been born 200 years ago,\u201d said Roberts. To catch them, all you have to do is wait. \u201cThis sort of collector doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody has gone to get that water lily because they want that water lily, then in 10 years\u2019 time ... they might be tempted to do something again.\u201d Roberts had a hunch that the bog orchid taken on his watch in 2001 was still going to turn up. \u201cThat is the world of plants,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people that do this are in for the long haul.\u201d *** The world of water lilies is not big at all. Unlike orchids, with their 25,000 species, the entire Nymphaeaceae family contains no more than 75. For gardeners in Europe, there really wasn\u2019t much to get to their hands on \u2013 beyond the white Nymphaea alba that occurs naturally in the continent\u2019s sheltered, still pools \u2013 until the 1890s. That was when a French businessman and botanist, Joseph Bory Latour-Marliac, managed to hybridise species found in America and Europe to create a new range of coloured, hardy water lilies. (Water lilies are divided into \u201ctropicals\u201d and \u201chardies\u201d). Claude Monet was one of his first customers. But even after that, water gardening never quite took off. You need a pond \u2013 Monet had five gardeners \u2013 and the plants have always remained something of a horticultural niche. \u201cThe water lily community is so small I could name all of them to you,\u201d the US dealer told me. The most expensive plants, typically rare hybrids with an unusual colour or shape, cost around \u00a350. Despite the modesty of the scene, however, there are flashes, unmistakable, of how water lilies can take a hold. The Bennett family, which looks after Britain\u2019s national collection, has been growing the plants in a series of former clay pits in Weymouth for three generations. I stopped by the garden one afternoon, and walked around the pools with James Bennett, whose grandfather, Norman, began importing Marliac water lilies in 1958. \u201cFor any pond keeper, it is really the jewel in the crown,\u201d he said. Only the odd flower was open \u2013 a small, startle of red on the water, like a brooch on a woman\u2019s coat. \u201cIt took me a long time to understand my water lilies,\u201d said Monet, not long before he died in 1926. \u201cThen, all of a sudden, I had the revelation of the enchantment of my pond.\u201d He painted nothing else for almost 30 years: losing first the horizon, and then the water\u2019s edge, ending up in abstraction. His obsession with water lilies pushed him over formal barriers until he came to doubt their validity, and even existence. \u201cTo express what I feel before nature,\u201d he wrote to Gustave Geffroy, the art critic, \u201cI totally forget the most elemental rules of painting, if they exist, every time.\u201d Before I left Weymouth, James Bennett mentioned someone I should speak to. His name was Harry Hutchings, and he keeps the largest private collection of tropical water lilies in the UK. Hutchings used to provide sound recording equipment to Pinewood, and a few Hollywood studios. When I arrived at his house, which is just outside Reigate, Hutchings, who is 75, was drinking a glass of wine in a conservatory whose windows were thick with the green of vegetation growing outside. \u201cI can see why you\u2019ve come to me,\u201d he said. Hutchings fell in love with water lilies when he saw the ponds at the Royal Horticultural Society\u2019s gardens at Wisley. \u201cI was struck,\u201d he told me. \u201cI just said, \u2018Got to do it.\u2019 \u2018Got to do it.\u2019\u201d He took me on a tour of his greenhouses. The floors were littered with four-way adaptors and the fragments of plastic plant pots. Tropical water lilies are a nightmare to keep alive in the UK. It costs a fortune to heat them through the winter, so Hutchings has come up with his own system of bubbling hot air through the tanks. A few nettles grew up alongside the 20 or 30 different cultivars that he keeps, elaborate beauties in blue and purple, that shimmered in the close air. Like other water lily collectors, Hutchings\u2019s real passion is for hybrids that he creates himself. He showed me his \u201cmother plant\u201d, a sturdy red cultivar called Miami Rose. \u201cYou can hit her with anything you like,\u201d he said. Hutchings has no great love for Kew, but he could not understand why someone would steal the Nymphaea thermarum. \u201cWho steals a Mona Lisa? What can you do with it?\u201d he reasoned. \u201cIt is a trophy. It is not worth a light.\u201d I asked him who he thought might have stolen it. Hutchings thought for a moment. Several European collectors he knows have given up on their plants since the financial crisis. \u201cI would imagine,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s almost certainly an American.\u201d *** Magdalena thinks the plant was taken by an amateur, rather than anyone with serious designs on marketing or selling the water lily. A more skilled thief could have helped themselves to dozens of tiny seedlings that grow at the base of the plant, and no one would have noticed. \u201cObsession breaks through everything,\u201d he said. I asked Magdalena what he made of the theft now. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, slowly. We were sitting in a staff room at Kew. One of the things that baffles him is why the world got interested in the Nymphaea thermarum and not the other plants that he works with. \u201cI can tell you histories which are as amazing as this,\u201d he said.    Who steals a Mona Lisa? What can you do with it? It is a trophy. It is not worth a light  Harry Hutchings     Then Magdalena took me on a tour of his glasshouse, which is rather like an intensive care ward in which the patients are not individuals, but lifeforms. He indicated plants, many of them ordinary-looking, as we walked past. \u201cThis one we don\u2019t know whether it still grows in the Mauritian highlands,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one: one plant in Panama.\u201d We came to a table of small shrubs with soft leathery leaves. They were Cylindrocline lorencei, a Mauritian tree that was only saved from extinction when cells from inside otherwise dead seeds were grown in the lab in the 1990s. \u201cThat is the very limit,\u201d he said. To Magdalena, the near extinction of these species is an affront, the most senseless thing. Architects, chemists, pharmaceutical companies, engineers are always coming to his glasshouse, trying to learn the secrets of his plants. \u201cThey are the most relevant things to humans really, even though humans don\u2019t realise it,\u201d he said. \u201cMost medicines come from plants and algae. Most new technology is going to come from plants and algae. The basis of antibiotics is plant and fungi, and what do we do? Nothing. We don\u2019t give a toss.\u201d At one point, we drifted into the Princess of Wales Conservatory and paused by the Nymphaea thermarum. Magdalena looked around. \u201cThe cure for Ebola is probably in this room,\u201d he said. We ended up next to a slender, unhappy looking tree \u2013 a Zanthoxylum paniculatum, also from Mauritius \u2013 which is the plant that Magdalena cannot grow. It has been at Kew for 28 years, and never produced a fruit. There is only one other specimen left on earth. But even standing there, next to this doomed plant, I admitted to Magdalena that I didn\u2019t feel anything. I didn\u2019t know what to feel. He tried to explain extinction in terms that I might understand. Each chromosome is a letter. Each gene is a word. Each organism is a book. \u201cEach plant that is dying contains words that have only been spoken in that book,\u201d he said. \u201cSo one plant goes, one book goes, and also one language goes and perhaps a sense of words that we will never understand. What would have happened with Shakespeare with no roses? And Monet with no water lilies?\u201d And then Magdalena seemed to arrive at his conclusion about the theft of the thermal water lily. \u201cThe thing I managed to get out of it is your attention,\u201d he said. And then, surrounded on all sides by his strange and vanishing plants, he took the voice of a loudspeaker announcer, politely calling us to the scene of a catastrophe. \u201cYour attention. Can I have your attention please?\u201d \u2022"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/28/12-steps-to-a-more-effective-un", "sentences": ["Francesco Mancini, senior adviser, International Peace Institute, Singapore, @ManciniFr Balance the power: On the UN security council, it is necessary to find a more balanced regional representation."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-28T07:00:05Z", "title": "15 steps to a more effective UN", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Governance", "United Nations", "Partnership", "Technology", "Human rights"], "article": "Mandeep Singh Tiwana, head of policy and research, Civicus, Johannesburg, South Africa, @CIVICUSalliance Work for people, not governments: We need to move away from the state-centric model of international governance towards a citizen-oriented model. Radical new forms of representation should be explored, such as citizens\u2019 panels.  Use technology to increase connectivity and transparency: New media, including mobile and social media, could help demystify international institutions and encourage participation. Alongside this, there could be more regular interactions by the leadership of intergovernmental organisations with civil society and the media, and the creation of accessible databases of statistical and other information on their work. Saket Mani, UN children and youth representative, World We Want 2015, Pune, India, @SaketMANI Take surveys: Join the biggest ever open/transparent survey called UN My World Survey 2015 which, through creative online and offline methods, allows people across the world to tell the United Nations the most important issues they would like the post-2015 agenda to address.  Another one is the World We Want 2015, which enables people to engage, visualise and analyse people\u2019s voices on sustainable development.  Use post-2015 as an opportunity for reform: In the drawn-out discussions on a post-2015 UN development agenda, the focus is on \u201cthe world we want,\u201d but not yet on \u201cthe UN we want\u201d. The current UN development system is far from having the operational mechanisms that the world needs.  Adam Malczak, head of outreach programmes, London International Model UN, London, UK, @Adam_Malczak Start a PR campaign: The UN could do more to promote itself. It is vital people see the real work the UN is doing, beyond the power struggles within the security council. Carry out an audit: As with any organisation, the UN could use some audits and reviews of its structure, administration and in particular the terms of employment for desk jobs. But for most of it, these are very hard-working people, doing everything they can in difficult circumstances, with enormous help from UN Volunteers. Samy Tshimanga, columnist, Dunia, Indianapolis, USA,  @La_General_ Include all countries: There needs to be more African representation sitting at the table. I was just doing some research the other day and I found a list of youth delegates at the UN and my country [Democratic Republic of Congo] was not listed. Where is the balance? Where is the diversity? Francesco Mancini, senior adviser, International Peace Institute, Singapore, @ManciniFr Balance the power: On the UN security council, it is necessary to find a more balanced regional representation. But we need to avoid increasing the number of members too much. The risk is we end up with a very indecisive council, even more than now. De-centralise the structure: The UN cannot ask the field to integrate more until the headquarters integrate. Ideally, I would be in favor of merging the department of political affairs with the department of peacekeeping operations. Country desks should be integrated too. For example, those who work on Haiti should all be part of the same team and respond to the same boss. Olav Kjorven, Director, Public Partnerships Division, Unicef, New York, USA, @olavkjorven Show leadership on human rights: The current picture on human rights is deeply worrying. There is an erosion of commitment to these most sacrosanct of UN norms. There are only two ways forward on this: either we have to go through another period of darkness to rediscover their essential necessity or we will see some real leadership emerge capable of rebuilding resolve. In this regard we should expect more from leaders of the large democracies. Reform financing: The UN is there to deliver global public goods. The future financing of the UN should reflect this. We need a system where all countries contribute, according to their capabilities and responsibilities, based on specific criteria that reflect levels of economic development and population. It is ridiculous that a handful of small countries in northern Europe continue to bankroll the UN (or a large share of it) on behalf of the rest of the world. Phil Robertson, deputy director, Asia division, Human Rights Watch, Bangkok, Thailand, @Reaproy Allocate more resources to human rights: There needs to be more resources put into the Office of the High Commission for Human Rights (OHCHR) because they are very stretched thin now. The OHCHR needs to be empowered with support from the secretary general, and have the tools to respond to rights crises as they occur.  Vary the veto: The big issue at the UN security council is not the number of members, it\u2019s that the five permanent members still have the veto. It\u2019s the veto authority that needs to be either reformed or done away with. Perhaps if there was a larger group of permanent members, and the veto requirement was not just one member vetoing, but say three members vetoing? The key is that one or two states should not be able to stop urgent actions in a place like Syria. Janos Pasztor, executive director of conservation, WWF International, Geneva, Switzerland, @jpasztor Be realistic about salaries: The UN, like any other organisation working in this area, needs to be able to attract talent in a competitive market, to address the extremely difficult issues of extreme poverty, often in dangerous and difficult situations. The \u201cexcessive\u201d UN salaries are no more excessive than those of other organisations working in this area. Stephanie Mbida, executive director, KickLoans, New York City, USA, @StephanieMbida Cut costs, foster creativity: The UN should focus on cutting expenses through technology and innovation, heightening transparency so that the public knows the great work they have been doing.

In the handsome 19th-century manor house at the centre of the estate, surrounded by sacks of drying red peppers, Acs has no doubt about who to blame for her heartbreak: the all-powerful conservative government in Budapest under Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the prime minister. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how high the pressure is now. We\u2019re living in fear. We have to protect one another. This couldn\u2019t happen in a normal country. It\u2019s incredible the things that are happening in this country.\u201d For the liberal middle classes of Budapest, the latest outrage in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary is the world\u2019s first internet tax, a gigabyte levy denounced at home and abroad as an assault on free speech while shoring up the budget. On Tuesday tens of thousands of protesters commanded bridges over the Danube in central Budapest in the biggest challenge to the prime minister since he returned to power in 2010. The demonstrators likened Orb\u00e1n to Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, and flew the EU flag, which Orban regularly denounces. Bernadett Sz\u00e9l, MP and co-leader of a small Green liberal party, cites the events in Kishantos and Budapest as a prime example of the \u201cendless cynicism\u201d of the prime minister and his party, Fidesz, whose actions and policies set him apart in the European Union, and are setting off alarm bells in Brussels and Washington. \u201cKishantos is a symbol of what Orb\u00e1n is doing. It\u2019s pure power and pure destruction. Fidesz is the state. The party is the state. We don\u2019t know how to end that.\u201d     Tens of thousands of protesters march against the introduction of an internet tax in Budapest. Photograph: PuzzlePix/Rex    In a time of collapsing public confidence in the political classes across Europe, Orb\u00e1n can claim to be unique \u2013 a gifted, popular strongman with the most formidable electoral mandate in the EU. Untroubled by a fragmented and morally bankrupt centre-left opposition, Orb\u00e1n led his rightwing Fidesz to a landslide victory in 2010. He coasted to a second term last April, won the European elections in May and in October took control of virtually every town and city in Hungary in local elections. Highly unusually, he has a two-thirds parliamentary majority, meaning that the vast Westminster lookalike on the banks of the Danube in Budapest is a rubber stamp. After his election hat-trick this year, he need not face the voters again until 2018. He shows every sign of using that time to reshape Hungary. The only organised opposition are the neo-fascists of the Jobbik party on the far right, suggesting that the opposition on the streets this week might challenge Orb\u00e1n but not really threaten him. \u201cOrb\u00e1n divides and rules. All decisions are taken by him,\u201d says a senior western diplomat in Budapest. \u201cHe\u2019s very skilled. He has a political vision. You might not like it, but he has it. Control is the key word here.\u201d Zsuzsanna Szel\u00e9nyi, a liberal left MP and psychologist who has studied Orb\u00e1n at close quarters as a colleague in the 1990s, describes him as restless and combative with leanings towards megalomania. \u201cHe\u2019s a very strong character, he\u2019s always talking of revolution. And a very polarising person. He needs enemies and is always creating them. That\u2019s how he sees the world. He was always a destructive person.\u201d The number one item on Orb\u00e1n\u2019s destroy list appears to be the western democratic model. In an infamous speech to supporters in Romania in July, he declared the western model dead and cited the authoritarian regimes of Russia, China, Turkey and Singapore as the templates to follow. \u201cWe are parting ways with western European dogmas, making ourselves independent from them,\u201d he declared. \u201cWe have to abandon liberal methods and principles of organising a society. The new state that we are building is an illiberal state, a non-liberal state.\u201d     Protesters don masks during demonstrations against the proposed internet tax. Photograph: PuzzlePix/Rex    To his many critics in Budapest, this means hollowing out democracy, retaining a semblance of pluralism while controlling all the key levers. Orb\u00e1n has used his power to rewrite the constitution and has appointed 11 of the 15 supreme court justices to guarantee himself a two-thirds majority on the constitutional court. \u201cThe vast majority of the justices are not only politically loyal, but very strongly connected to the Fidesz party,\u201d says Csaba Tordai, a constitutional lawyer. Orb\u00e1n has used new media laws to turn public television into a mouthpiece for his government, and used tax inspectors and advertising money to intimidate, impoverish and weaken critical media. \u201cJournalists don\u2019t go to jail here. But he controls the media and there\u2019s a lot of self-censorship,\u201d said the senior diplomat. \u201cWhen they want to intimidate they send in the tax inspectors. And you can always find something.\u201d He has launched a crackdown on opposition non-governmental organisations, accusing some of them, Putin-style, of being foreign agents. \u201cDuring the day these guys are civil activists and during the night they\u2019re political activists,\u201d says a senior government official. According to western and Hungarian diplomats in Budapest, Orb\u00e1n is planning to purge the diplomatic service, culling up to three-quarters of Hungary\u2019s ambassadors. He wants the banking sector, which is dominated by Austrians and Italians, partly renationalised so that 50% is in Hungarian hands. He has also ordered land leased by foreigners over the past 20 years to be returned to its Hungarian owners, arguing that the natives have been swindled by wealthy westerners. Brussels is threatening legal action. \u201cChina says it\u2019s a democracy,\u201d says the government spokesman, Zsoltan Kovacs, explaining the new policy. \u201cBy liberal, the prime minister means a rejection of everything before 2010.\u201d The radicalism of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s vision for Hungary has put him on a collision course with Brussels, although the EU is crucial to his plans as Hungary is to receive \u20ac34bn (\u00a326.8bn) in European funds over the next four years. Defying EU policy, Orb\u00e1n has cuddled up to Putin in Moscow at a time of the greatest tensions between Russia and the west since the 1980s. The result has been the strongest criticism from Washington of an EU member state. In January, Orb\u00e1n secretly went to Moscow, met Putin, and secured a $10bn (\u00a36.2bn) credit in return for awarding nuclear power contracts to the Russians. In September, he met the boss of Gazprom, the giant Russian gas monopoly, and ditched EU policy on Russia and Ukraine by refusing to repump gas supplies back to Ukraine from Hungary, sabotaging EU attempts to safeguard Kiev\u2019s energy requirements. Barack Obama unusually bracketed Hungary, a Nato ally and EU member state, recently with Azerbaijan, Russia, Venezuela and Egypt in attacking Orb\u00e1n\u2019s attitude to fundamental freedoms. Victoria Nuland, the US assistant secretary of state for European affairs, then went further in a clear reference to Orban: \u201cHow can you sleep under your Nato blanket at night while pushing \u2018illiberal democracy\u2019 by day, whipping up nationalism, restricting free press, or demonising civil society?\u201d The Americans then blacklisted 10 Hungarian officials, some of them said to be close to the prime minister, banning them from entering the US on the grounds of corruption and complaining about \u201ckleptocracy\u201d. The Orb\u00e1n government, prone to fanning paranoia and regularly conjuring conspiracy theories about foreign plots to undermine Hungary, insinuated the White House had been bribed. \u201cWe know the amount of money it cost to put Hungary\u2019s name alongside Egypt\u2019s,\u201d said the senior government official. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a lot of money. We know who\u2019s funding it. It\u2019s not easy with the Americans most of the time. It\u2019s quite unfriendly.\u201d In April, around the same time as Acs\u2019s organic crops were being pulverised, Budapest police raided the home of Vera Mora and took away her laptop. Mora runs the environmentalist non-governmental organisation \u0150kot\u00e1rs in Budapest, which acts as the intermediary distributor of money from Norway\u2019s generous aid programme for civil society projects in central and eastern Europe. Norway is providing \u20ac153m to Hungary over five years, 10% of it to \u201cindependent\u201d NGOs. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government demanded control over how the money is spent. Oslo refused and suspended payments of \u20ac140m, while still distributing \u20ac13m through \u0150kot\u00e1rs. The government then raided the NGO\u2019s offices and launched a corruption investigation. The investigators have said they are pressing charges \u201con suspicion of mismanagement, budget fraud, forgery of private documents and unauthorised financial activity.\u201d Reviewing the police evidence, the news website index.hu said: \u201cThis is how a show trial looks in a history book.\u201d     Viktor Orban takes his oath of office in parliament in 2010. He need not face the voters again until 2018. Photograph: Karoly Arvai /Reuters    The Norwegians are furious, demanding that Brussels take action. \u201cWe have this programme in 16 countries. The only place we have problems is Hungary,\u201d said Tove Skarstein, the Norwegian ambassador in Budapest. \u201cThe fact that something like this is happening in the EU is quite shocking,\u201d said Mora. In his drive to create a new political system in Hungary, Orb\u00e1n appears to view politics as a zero-sum game where the winner takes all in a fight between good and evil. In July, Orb\u00e1n thanked the opposition for his landslide victories \u2013 \u201cthose who turned against us and provided the chance for good to win. Because if there is no bad, how could good get mastery over the bad?\u201d It is a binary, polarising outlook that recalls the tactics of another strongman leader, president Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey. Both appear to believe democracy ends at the ballot box. \u201cDemocracy does not mean the dictatorship of the majority,\u201d said Marton Gulyas, director of Kr\u00e9tak\u0151r, a political art and theatre group whose state funding has been reduced by the Hungarian government. \u201cPeople were tired of the endless fighting and in 2010 they said we need one leader to put the country in order, to take it in one direction. We were in no-man\u2019s land. Since then they\u2019ve changed everything.\u201d     Foreign ministers Gyula Horn, right, of Hungary and Alois Mock of Austria cutting the iron curtain between Hungary and Austria in 1989.  Photograph: Karoly Matusz/EPA    In a detailed analysis of the clampdown on civil society, Heather Grabbe, director of EU affairs in Brussels for George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, concluded Orb\u00e1n was rolling back the democratic gains achieved in central Europe since the revolutions of 1989, which brought Orb\u00e1n to national prominence as a student leader telling the Russians to go home. \u201cHungary is quickly losing the defining features of a democracy under the rule of law,\u201d Grabbe wrote. \u201cIndependent civil society organisations are the last remaining check on government power in Hungary. Since 2010 the government has enjoyed a parliamentary super-majority which it has used to undermine the independence of the judiciary, the power of the constitutional court and media freedom and pluralism, as well as to gain control over state institutions.\u201d But while Orb\u00e1n has amassed formidable power, he is not omnipotent as the current wave of internet-fuelled protest shows. His vote is down considerably since 2010. He does not command a simple voters\u2019 majority either in Budapest or nationwide. But he has used his powers to change laws and gerrymander constituencies to tilt the system, making it much harder to defeat Fidesz at the ballot box. \u201cHungary is not an illiberal democracy yet,\u201d said Szel\u00e9nyi. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously in danger.\u201d     Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s rightwing Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament in Budapest.

Nowhere is the phenomenon more pronounced than in China, where a state-orchestrated urbanisation drive has prompted a megacity building bonanza characterised by skyscrapers and sprawl.  By the end of 2015, one in three of the world\u2019s buildings over 150-metres will be in China. Construction of the world\u2019s second-tallest building, the 632-metre tall Shanghai Tower, is due to be completed next year. Few people outside China have heard of Suzhou, a city in the eastern province of Jiangsu with a population of 1.3 million (China now has over 140 cities of more than one million people; America has nine).  Yet if all goes to plan, Suzhou will soon boast the world\u2019s third-tallest building, the 700m Zhongnan Centre. Other Chinese cities joining the upward rush include Shenzhen, Wuhan, Tianjin and Shenyang. By 2020, China is set to be home to six of the world\u2019s 10 tallest buildings, although none will top the globe\u2019s current highest, the 828m Burj Khalifa in Dubai.     The planned 700m Zhongnan Centre in Suzhou, which is set to be the world\u2019s third tallest building when completed    Zoning laws, listed buildings and other well-intentioned hallmarks of democratic society can impede the march of progress; the opposition to London\u2019s Shard would be unimaginable in contemporary China.  The dramatic experiments in skyscraper construction and urban planning in the one-party state will, increasingly, hold lessons for cities the world over. As a response to the dilemma of how to build densely while retaining liveability, the Shanghai Tower may be the closest architects have yet come to creating a \u201cvertical city\u201d.  Designed by the American firm Gensler (pdf), the building forms a spiralling trunk that takes the amenities of the horizontal city block \u2013 homes, shops, offices, galleries, multiplexes \u2013 and stacks them on a vertical plane.  Its \u201csky gardens\u201d \u2013 around one-third of the site is green space \u2013 will showcase flora from around China, countering the predilection of developers to commercialise every square inch. According to Wood: \u201cThe commitment to public space \u2026 that\u2019s what elevates the Shanghai Tower to be a potentially fantastic building.\u201d But this, he adds, is only the start; architects need to be more radical still. \u201cI hear a lot of developers talking about putting so many uses in the building you\u2019ll never have to leave it,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, is it not? Who would ever not want to leave the building?\u201d      The 632m Shanghai Tower (tallest building, left) under construction. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex    Instead, he calls for \u201csustainable vertical urbanism\u201d, or the linkage of clustered tall buildings with sky bridges and elevated plazas replicating the ground floor in the air. A building should be responsive to topology as in vernacular architecture \u2013 Calgary and Khartoum should look different \u2013 and be designed in consideration of the buildings around it. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that every science-fiction film, from Metropolis to Blade Runner through to Star Wars, envisages the dense, multi-level city of the future,\u201d Wood adds. \u201cThe reason is because it completely makes sense.\u201d A proposed development that comes closer than most to this ideal is Cloud Citizen, which co-won a design competition in Shenzhen, a city in southern China.  If built, the 1.7 million square-metre complex would be \u201cas much a strategy for how to build future cities capable of giving back more to the environment than they cost, as it is a singular iconographic mega building complex with an identifiable and striking skyline,\u201d say the architects.  Sky bridges and plazas connect the towers, the tallest of which is 680m, in a cloud-like mass. Cloud Citizen would have offices, parks, cultural facilities and homes with an ability to harvest rainwater, produce food and create power from the sun, wind and algae \u2013 a mini-city within a city.     Shenzen\u2019s Cloud Citizen would be a mini-city within a city - containing offices, parks, cultural facilities and homes with an ability to harvest rainwater, produce food and create power from the sun, wind and algae    Super tall towers are as much about prestige as commercial gain. In China they are also symptomatic of a central government policy that has led to the frantic densification of cities.  Premier Li Keqiang has called urbanisation a \u201chuge engine\u201d for growth as the government attempts to restructure its economy away from a reliance on exports and investment to one based on domestic spending. While most people in China were farmers 30 years ago, 50% of people lived in cities by 2011 and by 2030 it\u2019s estimated one billion people, or 70% of the population, will be urbanites. Getting cities wrong could create slums, exacerbate climate change and encourage social instability. The United Nations Population Division projects that by 2050, 66% of the world\u2019s population will be urban, up from 54% today. Once population growth is factored in, this amounts to 2.5 billion more people living in cities. At the CTBUH conference in Shanghai, architects agreed that sprawl is not a sustainable solution to density. But building towers of dizzying height in a never-ending game of architectural one-upmanship is impractical too. \u201cWe have to find the solution of how to move towards more density but to keep the human scale\u201d, says Yosuke Hayano, principal partner of MAD Architects, a Beijing-based practice. \u201cPeople are very sensitive to space.\u201d MAD designs on a theory they call shan shui (\u201cmountain water\u201d), in reference to the way cities were strategically positioned in ancient China near rivers and mountains.  The Zendai Himalayas Centre, a 560,000 sq m development in the eastern city of Nanjing due for completion in 2017, is a ring of undulating hill-shaped \u201ctowers\u201d around a cluster of low buildings, with vertical louvres creating the impression of waterfalls. This mimicry of nature, MAD believes, imbues urban environments with humanity.     The Interlace residential apartments in Singapore resemble an orderly stack of Jenga blocks.  Photograph: OMA    Ole Scheeren, a German architect based in China and Hong Kong, thinks architects need to \u201cmove away from the isolation that is embedded in the typology of the tower\u201d.  Scheeren co-designed the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, which houses the state-run broadcaster and is one of the capital\u2019s icons. It\u2019s a striking cuboid loop of tower of 473,000 sq m. Alarmed at the \u201caccumulation of singularities\u201d, or mono-functional towers accruing in Asian cities, Scheeren\u2019s buildings are prototypes for urban centres that need to be dense yet diverse, porous and livable. For Interlace, a residential compound of 1,000 apartments in Singapore, Scheeren was tasked with building 12 towers of 24 storeys organised on a grid. \u201cThe sense of living in a community is not explored well spatially in a configuration like this,\u201d Scheeren says. He toppled the towers, forming an interconnected mesh of buildings that resemble an orderly stack of Jenga blocks, creating space for parks, public courtyards and a running track. \u201cWhere towers used to be relatively monotonous and simple repetitive structures they\u2019re becoming more integrated and connected and also vertically diverse,\u201d Scheeren says. \u201cIn that sense they will, I believe, attain more aspects of the words everybody likes to use: \u2018vertical cities\u2019.\u201d "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/oct/30/ad-break-ikea-halloween-sony-4k", "sentences": ["     Ikea: \u2018Halloween\u2019 (starts at 00:06) - Singapore This re-imagining of The Shining is set inside an Ikea at night instead of the empty hotel occupied by Jack Nicolson\u2019s family in the Stanley Kubrick film.", "Mind you, the Swedish superstore would be blissful if it was as empty as this even there were a trio of creepy children trying to scare the living daylights out of you - the real horror of the Ikea experience are the crowds of marauding ditherers as you try to negotiate the labyrinth.Agency: BBH (Singapore)Director: Jordan Quellman Oatly: \u2018Wow, No Cow!\u2019 (starts at 01:33) - Sweden Not even Richard Branson has the self-promoting acumen of Oatly CEO Toni Peterrson who has a wonderful lack of self-consciousness as he murders the song he wrong about the product he sells."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-30T15:43:08Z", "title": "Ad break: Ikea's spooky Halloween, Sony 4K", "tags": ["Advertising", "Media", "Halloween", "UK news", "US news"], "article": "     Ikea: \u2018Halloween\u2019 (starts at 00:06) - Singapore This re-imagining of The Shining is set inside an Ikea at night instead of the empty hotel occupied by Jack Nicolson\u2019s family in the Stanley Kubrick film.

Labor has urged Tony Abbott to actively engage with China on its proposal for an Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which is designed to lend money for infrastructure projects in the region. According to reports on Friday, cabinet had been split on the issue of whether to join. The treasurer, Joe Hockey, favoured negotiating from the inside of the organisation while foreign minister Julie Bishop argued against joining on strategic grounds \u2013 reflecting the US position.  Abbott has decided not to accept China\u2019s current terms for membership and his cabinet\u2019s national security committee also recommended against joining for strategic reasons. \u201cWe would like to join, but it\u2019s got to be a multilateral institution with the kind of transparency and the kind of governance arrangements that, for argument\u2019s sake, the World Bank has,\u201d Abbott said on Friday. \u201cShould we get that sort of transparency and those sorts of governance arrangements, not only will Australia be happy to join, but I imagine that Korea and Japan and the United States would also be happy to join and that would mean that we would have a maximally funded and maximally competitive infrastructure bank here in Asia.\u201d His views reflect those of the US secretary of state, John Kerry, whose spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, was quoted as saying last week: \u201cSecretary Kerry has made clear directly to the Chinese as well as to other partners that we \u200ewelcome the idea of an infrastructure bank for Asia but we strongly urge that it meet international standards of governance and transparency.\u201d  It leaves Australia outside the AIIB, which signed up 20 founding members last Friday and has total starting capital of $50bn, mostly provided by China. In the region, only Indonesia, Australia and South Korea refused and Japan was not expected to join.  Former prime minister Paul Keating, who is chairman of the international board of the China Development Bank, told the Australian Financial Review this week that it was the worst decision Tony Abbott has made in the life of his government.  \u201cThe government\u2019s decision to decline founding membership of the Chinese-proposed Asian infrastructure bank is the worst policy decision the government has taken since assuming office,\u201d Keating said. \u201cIt is the worst because of the far-reaching implications and consequences of deciding to have nothing geo-economically to do with China at a time when China is prepared to step up to greater responsibilities in the region.\u201d Opposition leader Bill Shorten said while governance and transparency arrangements needed to be worked through, there was an enormous need for increased infrastructure investment in the Asia-Pacific. \u201cThis is not how important economic decisions should be made,\u201d he said. \u201cOn one hand, treasurer Hockey and the cabinet have a discussion and they make a decision to give the thumbs-up to the investment bank, then Julie Bishop goes to the national security committee and rolls Joe Hockey, and what on earth is Tony Abbott doing?  \u201cI think this sends a worrying signal in Australia, that at the very heart of government, cabinet subcommittees and the cabinet, the fact that they are going in significantly different directions, the fact that we know about it, is a worrying sign for foreign relations.\u201d But the prime minister rejected the suggestion that there would be repercussions on the Australian-China relationship, using the negotiations on the bilateral free trade agreement as evidence of good relations. \u201cIn the end, the free trade agreement that is being negotiated between China and Australia is good for both countries \u2013 it is good for both countries,\u201d he said. Writing in the state-owned China Daily on Friday, Simon Tay, chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs and an associate professor teaching international law at the National University of Singapore, said the absence of US allies was predictable. \u201cChina has launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank with the conspicuous absence of the United States and its major allies. With China hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November, this issue is coming to a boil,\u201d Tay writes. \u201cThe US\u2019s absence should not surprise. The bank proposal runs against the established regional and global order, in which the US dominates the World Bank while the Japanese traditionally head the Asian Development Bank. \u201cYet such arrangements, based on history, fail to reflect the reality of China\u2019s current and still growing economic weight. The existing banks also seem unable to meet the real needs for infrastructure across Asia, both now and in the future.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/oct/31/mozfest-2014-creative-chaos-in-the-best-possible-way", "sentences": ["We spoke to people from Tennessee, Singapore, Mombasa and India, with over 50 countries represented in total."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-31T11:44:47Z", "title": "MozFest 2014: creative chaos \u2013 in the best possible way", "tags": ["Technology", "Conferences", "Programming", "Computing"], "article": "I think the moment I first realised this tech event would be different was when I saw a pile of napkins bearing this legend:     Even the napkins at MozFest were inspirational Photograph: Matt Andrews/Guardian    What happens when you bring together 1700 hackers, teachers, journalists, artists and other creative technologists for a weekend in a vast, ideas-filled space? The answer \u2013 in the best possible way \u2013 is chaos. Chaos gets a bad rep. Mozilla Festival, now in its fifth year and affectionately known as MozFest, is unashamedly thrown together: sessions are spontaneous and guided by their participants; banners, posters and enormous flying blimps litter the corridors and teaching spaces; wild-eyed children run past armed with robots and LED boards; a life-sized Firefox mascot wanders around hugging excited festivalgoers.     Guardian developer Will Franklin filling in a sign for \u201cMy dream for the open web\u201d Photograph: Guardian    The festival is loosely structured around eleven \u201ctracks\u201d with names like Open Web With Things, Art and Culture of the Web, Policy &amp; Advocacy and (most relevant for us at the Guardian) Source Code for Journalism. Each track is made up of multiple sessions over the two days of the festival, covering as broad a range of topics as making fonts out of Minecraft, principles for an open web and cleaning up mangled datasets. There are almost no \u201cclosed\u201d sessions: each space is divided by a few movable partition walls, meaning sound from animated speakers in other sessions frequently bleeds into the session you\u2019re participating in. It all seems to work, though. As tech events go, MozFest had the most diverse set of attendees and facilitators I\u2019ve ever seen. We spoke to people from Tennessee, Singapore, Mombasa and India, with over 50 countries represented in total. Mixed in among the sessions on building for the web and crowdsourcing data were a wide range of workshops on inclusivity, community diversity and closing the gender gap \u2013 the prominence of this track alongside all the others demonstrates Mozilla\u2019s commitment to the openness \u2013 in every sense \u2013 of the web. Mozilla, of course, are huge on advocacy and activism: many of the opening and closing keynote speeches are given over to teaching the web (whether code or digital rights) to children, or helping the developing world gain a foothold before \u201cempire-building\u201d tech giants monopolise them, too. CoderDojo CEO Mary Moloney spoke passionately on the Saturday morning about how the festival\u2019s audience of \u201cgiants\u201d should reach down and help a \u201csmall person\u201d onto their shoulder. Director and life peer Beeban Kidron gave a fantastic speech on iRights, a movement to teach young people about online behaviour. Mozilla\u2019s \u201cchief lizard wrangler\u201d (aka executive chair Mitchell Baker) was there to talk about Mozilla\u2019s mission and Firefox\u2019s origins in a closed web.  Here are a few session highlights from my two days at MozFest: Hack the News Org (Dan Sinker &amp; Trei Brundrett)     Dan Sinker and Trei Brandrett running their session at MozFest Photograph: Matt Andrews/Guardian    This interactive workshop had us mixed into groups and budgeting for a fictional news organisation and working out how we\u2019d make a return on investment (or at least, prove we were sustainable) with a budget of $2m over two years. Our group were challenged to spec out a \u201ccommunity website for Argentinians about urban planning\u201d which was challenging to say the least, and we ended up arguing over how much outsourcing we\u2019d do and ended up with $1.9m left over at the end. Still: thinking in real terms about how to fund digital news was an interesting thought experiment and definitely generated debate. Hacking the Gender Gap (Georgia Guthrie) This group discussion was centred around a personal task: each attendee had to write a positive and negative moment in their tech experience, along with their age, and pin it to a board in a chronological timeline. The range of experiences was fascinating, if depressing: many female attendees experienced early moments of joy and excitement discovering computing, but equally many were told by authority figures that \u201cgirls can\u2019t be programmers\u201d, or reached their teenage years to be told to pander to the male gaze in order to win respect. The rest of the session was devoted to discussing the issues raised and answering questions as a group generally about practical things we could do. The session was only an hour but felt like it could\u2019ve spanned the entire weekend.  I have listicles, is there a cure? (Mallory Busch) Perhaps the best title of the sessions I went to, this workshop aimed to challenge us to consider the infamous BuzzFeed \u201clisticle\u201d and see how it could be applied to more serious news. Each group was assigned an article to convert into listicle format: while some groups struggled, finding their topic challenging to trivialise, my partner Nic and I managed to turn this Huffington Post story about an arrested busker into a fairly respectable draft listicle. As well as being enormously fun to produce this was actually quite an interesting challenge: how can we distil the essence of a story into the important, entertaining and relevant facts?  Facilitating a session Now, it\u2019d be quite vain to list my own session as a highlight, but it\u2019s worth discussing the experience of contributing back to MozFest. Over 500 of the 1700 attendees ran sessions \u2013 my own, along with Guardian colleagues Wendy Orr and Laura Oliver, was called Moderation in Moderation, and dealt with working with online communities.     Matt Andrews, Wendy Orr and Laura Oliver of the Guardian, presenting \u201cModeration in Moderation\u201d Photograph: Jenny Sivapalan/Guardian    We\u2019d been given the slot of 5-6pm on Sunday \u2013 the final hour of the final day. We were a bit worried that nobody would show up, but in true \u201cif you build it, they will come\u201d style, a steady trickle of attendees showed up and helped us brainstorm ideas about managing real-world online community challenges. We\u2019d been told in facilitator onboarding that a MozFest session is really just a group conversation \u2013 once we got our groups going we were able to sit back and get involved ourselves. It was genuinely rewarding despite the panic that nobody would come, and an experience I\u2019ll definitely repeat next year.     Session attendees at the Guardian\u2019s \u201cModeration in Moderation\u201d session at MozFest Photograph: Matt Andrews/Guardian    All in all: MozFest is unlike any other event I\u2019ve attended, except possibly a tech-themed Glastonbury: there\u2019s far too much going on that you can\u2019t possibly see all the stuff you\u2019re interested in, but there\u2019s so much going on around the fringes and in the spaces between \u201cstages\u201d that you\u2019ll almost always end up discovering something brilliant. The coffee was absolutely fantastic, the enthusiasm and passion of the people running the show was infectious, and to boot: they gave out 1000 free Firefox OS smartphones (aimed at emerging markets) to nearly every attendee \u2013 with the request that we report bugs, put them through their paces and even create apps for them.

Last month he walked into a studio in London (not his: too many stairs) to photograph some of Britain\u2019s oldest people. The youngest was just 100; the oldest 107. Dressed in a baggy polo shirt and a pair of old combat trousers, small but physically imposing, Bailey flirted, flattered, insulted his subjects in order to get the picture he wanted. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married for 62 years,\u201d Shirley Arkush told Bailey of her husband David, one of the centenarians waiting to be photographed. \u201cSame as me,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut not to the same wife.\u201d And he gave a combative, high-pitched laugh. (Bailey\u2019s marriage to his first wife, Rosemary Bramble, lasted three years, and his second, to Catherine Deneuve, two; he was married to Marie Helvin for 10 years, before marrying Catherine Dyer in 1986.) In the background, three good-looking, young assistants arranged screens, spotlights and a camera tripod, and seemed careful not to put a foot wrong, while Bailey chatted to each new arrival. He is a photographer first and nosy interviewer a close second. \u201cHow old was your mum when she died?\u201d he asked one subject, trying to work out if there are genetic predictors to longevity. Bailey\u2019s mother, Gladys, who brought him up with his aunt Dolly after his father walked out, died in her 90s. He worked at an incredible pace \u2013 nine portraits in four hours, and on subjects with a collective age of 917 years. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to photograph old people,\u201d he said at one point, after pinning one centenarian in forensic close-up (he had requested no makeup, only \u201ca tidy-up\u201d for the women). Not everyone was happy. Joe Britton, 103, Chelsea Pensioner and horseracing enthusiast, said he knew Bailey and had been looking forward to seeing him again. But, \u201cThat\u2019s not David Bailey,\u201d he said with disappointment after the shoot \u2013 his David Bailey is the horse trainer. Fauja Singh, 103, former farmer and marathon runner Fauja Singh was born in Bias Pind, in the Punjab, India, where his father was a farmer. He married Gian Kaur in 1928 and was widowed in 1992. He has four surviving children, Jaswinder, Parminder, Sukhjinder and Harvinder (his daughter Gurbash died after giving birth to her third daughter in 1977; his son Kuldip was killed in 1994). After moving to England, he ran the 2000 London Marathon \u2013 his first \u2013 at 89. He lives with Sukhjinder, who runs a plumbing business, in Essex. (Fauja doesn\u2019t speak English, so his story is translated by Harmander Singh, his friend and former trainer.) I couldn\u2019t walk until I was five. My legs were so spindly, I was nicknamed \u201cdanda\u201d [stick]. I couldn\u2019t even walk a mile at 15. Perhaps it was the Almighty\u2019s way of preserving them for later. I was close to my aunt. Her husband died during the plague and she wanted someone to look after, so I went to live with her. Because I had been so weak, I was indulged and became naughty and spoiled. I used to push other children around, thinking nobody was going to believe them if they complained. I worked for many years as a farmer. It was a tough life and I spent my time tilling the land with oxen. By my 80s, all was going well. I had bought a tractor and rented more land. In August 1994 there were strong monsoon winds and Kuldip, my middle son, who was living with me, went to check on his new venture \u2013 a roadside restaurant being built near our house. The wind picked up the corrugated iron sheeting from the roof and flung it at his head, killing him instantly. I was devastated. You love all your children equally, but I had a special bond with Kuldip, since my other children had moved abroad. I\u2019d sit in the cemetery and say, \u201cGod, why didn\u2019t you take me instead?\u201d Friends said the only way to save me was to get me away from the village, so Sukhjinder brought me here to forget. At first I didn\u2019t like it. I was bored. I\u2019m a very fidgety person and can\u2019t sit still. Sukhjinder\u2019s always taking things away from me, like the phone cord, bits of paper, saying stop fiddling. Then I started socialising in the Sikh temples and there were these tournaments, with running, wrestling and kabaddi \u2013 it reminded me of being in India. I used to challenge OAPs to 100m sprints, then we doubled the distance. I started running for charity, for cancer research, 5k and 10k, and built up. Back in India, I would play \u201cchase the rooster\u201d [a rooster is let loose and you have to catch it], and that got you sharp. But that was not competitive. One year of serious training with Harmander turned me into an athlete. Of course, running used to hurt a lot, but it distracted me from my grief; the fact that it gave me health, recognition and helped others is what kept me going. I retired last year after competing in a 10k run in the Hong Kong Marathon. [Singh\u2019s last full marathon was London in 2004; he achieved a personal best of five hours 40 minutes in the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon at 92.] I ran it in 93 minutes. My best time was 64 minutes, and Harmander thought it was a signal I shouldn\u2019t do any more. I know I\u2019m getting weaker but my mind and spirit are still strong. I used to run or jog 10 miles a day. Now I do the same, but walking and maybe some jogging. I only eat in moderation and that has contributed to my long life. In poor countries, people die of starvation; in rich countries, people die from overeating. For breakfast I have toast, a cup of tea and half a bowl of hot crushed alsi pinni [an Indian sweet made from flaxseed, nuts, wholemeal flour and jaggery cooked in clarified butter]. If you\u2019ve got your health, you\u2019ve got everything. Without it, your wealth, bungalow and big car are meaningless. My only extravagance is clothes and shoes. I have 50 pairs of shoes and eight pairs of trainers. I like to look dapper.      Eileen Symonds: \u2018One of the saddest things is not being able to drive any more. I had a prang at 98. It wasn\u2019t my fault but the car was messed up, and that was the end, really.\u2019 Photograph: David Bailey/Guardian    Eileen Symonds, 100, former model Eileen Symonds was born in the City of London, where her father ran a pub before going into the refrigeration business. She married Bernard (\u201cBim\u201d) in 1938 and was widowed in 1993. She has three daughters, Angela, 75, Caroline, 72, and Laura, 67, nine grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren. My mother was wonderful, she was young, very pretty and had lovely auburn hair. She was a little bit plump but she had a great personality and that\u2019s the main thing. When I was a little girl, I was a very good ballet dancer, very good on pointe. My father was in the Masonics and occasionally I\u2019d be asked to dance at one of their dos. I suppose I was rather good at it. But when I was 11 it was decided I should go to boarding school, and of course they don\u2019t do ballet at boarding school, so I had to give it up. My brother was the apple of everybody\u2019s eyes. He was very good-looking, a very good boy. I wasn\u2019t. I was rather grizzly and naughty, and not so nice. When I left school at 16 or 17, my mother got me into a couturier\u2019s in Conduit Street and I went there as a runabout. The house models were six foot, slim, and they used to glide down the catwalk and glide back again. I was a plump schoolgirl, and I used to think they were so beautiful. And then I must have dieted a bit and thought, I could do this \u2013 not there, because I was only five foot six, but I modelled for a Jewish chap, the kindest old fellow you ever knew, mostly coats and costumes because I had a good pair of square shoulders. And of course you always had to have good posture. London before the war was wonderful. If you had a boyfriend, you\u2019d go to a Lyons Corner House, which was very bright and gay, and I\u2019d have a salad. Bernard was the brother of someone I knew well at school. The first time I met him, I didn\u2019t fall head over heels in love. He didn\u2019t look anything very ravishing. But he was nice, a very good man. He was already engaged to a girl called Agnes. But he must have taken a bit of a shine to me because he\u2019d meet me from work and we\u2019d go to one of the Corner Houses. One evening he showed me Agnes\u2019s engagement ring and the waitress came rushing over and said, \u201cOh! Congratulations!\u201d And I said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t for me, it\u2019s for his fiancee.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I thought it was for you two. You always come in here together.\u201d Anyhow, he proposed to me a couple of months later and we got married in 1938. I knew Agnes a bit. She wouldn\u2019t have been right for him. Not go-ey enough. She was clever, a schoolteacher, one of those. Didn\u2019t suit him. My mother was widowed at 52 and lived with us until she died at 98. I think my husband would have been happy if she hadn\u2019t been around, because I spent a lot of time looking after her. But on the other hand she was wonderful, because if I did go out, she was there to look after the girls. You can\u2019t have it both ways. I like a drink and I smoke about five cigarettes a day. Wine goes acid on me, and the only drink I really enjoy is whiskey and ginger ale. I have that twice a day, one before lunch and one before dinner. One of the saddest things is not being able to drive any more. I had a prang at 98. It wasn\u2019t my fault but the car was messed up, and that was the end, really. Your looks go as you get older \u2013 it\u2019s nature. It\u2019s no good being sad about it. Fortunately I\u2019ve got good teeth and hair. My daughters are the same. They\u2019ve got lovely teeth, all of them.      Michael Klanga: \u2018He drank wine with every meal right up until last year. But we stopped it six months ago because he gets dizzy spells and now the care home trick him with Ribena.\u2019 Photograph: David Bailey/Guardian    Michael Klanga, 107, former owner of a delicatessen Michael Klanga was born, the youngest of 12, in a small village near Nicosia in Cyprus, where his father was a farmer. He married Maria in 1934 and moved to the UK in 1956 with his seven children, Andrew, 79, Kosta, 77, Chris, 75, Helen, 73, George, 71, Charlie, 68, and Irene, 65. Widowed in 1993, he has 17 surviving grandchildren (his grandson Christopher was killed on a zebra crossing, aged 14) and 21 great-grandchildren. Michael has dementia, so Irene tells his story. My father was nearly 50 when he came to England. He was a farmer in Cyprus, growing tomatoes and cucumbers; we had goats and sheep, and made our own cheese. But it was a hard life. In those days you had to have a guarantor to come here. You couldn\u2019t just show up. My uncle sponsored us. He had a classy French restaurant in Soho called Epicure, and my daddy used to work in the kitchen and as a waiter. He opened MC Klanga delicatessen on Camden Road in 1962 when he was 55. He sold olives, cheeses, fruit, everything. He never learned to speak English, but he knew all the English words for things in his shop. He worked with Greek people, mixed with Greek people. He retired in his mid-70s. The shop is still there, now called The Green Door Food Bazaar. My mum was the quiet one. Dad liked the good life, going out to the Greek cafes and bars down Holloway Road. He liked drinking, dancing, singing \u2013 he had a fantastic voice. Every time someone had a wedding in the village back home, they used to invite him to sing. When Mum died, he came to live near me. Even when he was 100, he\u2019d get the train and bus on his own to see his friends. His mother lived to 104, and if you asked him why he\u2019s lived so long, he\u2019d probably say it was the drinking. He loves red, dry wine. He drank wine with every meal right up until last year. But we stopped it six months ago because he gets dizzy spells and now the care home trick him with Ribena. He never learned to drive. He could drive a tractor in Cyprus, so assumed he could drive here. He had two lessons and failed the test, and the instructor got out of the car and said he\u2019d never drive with him again. At first he didn\u2019t want to move into the care home. Anyone who visited, he\u2019d say: \u201cIf I give you some money, will you get me some paper bags so I can pack my stuff?\u201d Now he loves it. He thinks he\u2019s in a hotel in Cyprus.      David Arkush: \u2018I retired when I was 70, and it was a relief. I never liked being a dentist. I didn\u2019t like looking into people\u2019s mouths.\u2019 Photograph: David Bailey/Guardian    David Arkush, 100, former dentist David Arkush was born in Glasgow, the youngest of five, to Polish Jewish immigrants. He lives in London with Shirley, 83, his wife of 62 years, and attends Jewish Care\u2019s Michael Sobell Community Centre, in Golders Green, north London. He has two children, Jonathan, 60, and Deborah, 58, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. My father was a rabbi. He said, you\u2019ll never be a businessman, so you\u2019d better be a professional. He didn\u2019t have a very high opinion of any of his children. He was quick-tempered and tended to lash out. He wasn\u2019t a terribly nice man. I was close to my mother. I used to sit on her knee late at night, while my father was at the synagogue, and she\u2019d sing this song to me about a son who left home and went to America, and before he went, she sang to him, in Yiddish, \u201cWrite a letter to your mother, do not forget to write to me.\u201d But his heart was hard and he never wrote. When I left home, we always wrote to each other \u2013 the whole family kept up a correspondence. I\u2019d have liked to have gone to Oxford or Cambridge to read modern languages, but in those days they thought, what sort of job is that? My father\u2019s brother-in-law was a dentist, so I went to the dental school at Liverpool University. As soon as the war broke out, I felt it was my duty to volunteer. I joined the Royal Army Dental Corps when I was 25 and was posted to Singapore. I was captured by the Japanese in 1942 and kept at Changi prisoner of war camp in Singapore. Later, I was put on a cattle truck and transferred to camps in Thailand. The Japanese were all right to me, because I was useful \u2013 they didn\u2019t have any dentists. They knocked up a chair that was usable, and I had some kit. I didn\u2019t have a drill. I had hand instruments and some local anaesthetic; zinc oxide and oil of cloves makes a temporary filling which is really not bad. I remember treating one Japanese patient, and I was bashing away at his teeth and suddenly his hand went down to his sword and I thought, go easy, David, you want to get home. I treated them more gently after that. My parents didn\u2019t know for 18 months whether I was alive or dead, and it upset my father very much. Then one of his congregants phoned to say he\u2019d heard that I was a PoW, and he had a stroke while he was on the phone. He was alive when I came home in the autumn of 1945, but in a bad way and died soon after. When I saw my mother, she cried and flung her arms around me. She died when she was 91. I set up my first practice in Edgware, Middlesex. I found an empty building and my brother lent me \u00a3100 to buy secondhand equipment. I met Shirley in a hotel in Bournemouth in 1950. I had a beautiful powder-blue car and none of her boyfriends had a car. I\u2019m not good with money. Shirley always said I never charged enough. She says I\u2019m too good-natured and left all the disciplining of the children to her. But we didn\u2019t have to use much: they were lovely, our children. I adored them. I retired when I was 70, and it was a relief. I never liked being a dentist. I didn\u2019t like looking into people\u2019s mouths. I used to like opera concerts and visiting stately homes. Now I like sleeping and Shirley\u2019s fried halibut. She\u2019s a very good cook.      Maud Ford: \u2018The secret to a long life is taking things lightly, not worrying too much.\u2019 Photograph: David Bailey/Guardian    Maud Ford MBE, 100, former administrator Maud Ford was born in north London, the eighth of nine children. She married Stephen, a plumber, in 1934, and was widowed in 1998. She has a daughter, Janet, 75, two grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, and has lived in sheltered housing since 1985. I was born in Hornsey a century ago, but you can still see St Mary\u2019s, the big church where my dad worked on the bell tower. I used to take him lunch from home in an open bowl covered with a red handkerchief and he\u2019d say, \u201cHere comes my little fairy.\u201d He had a bad chest, and later couldn\u2019t work. He stayed home and did the cooking, and Mum worked as a cleaner and took in washing. She\u2019d wash it overnight and iron it, and take it back the next day. Women worked hellish hard in those days. I liked school, but left at 14 to help my parents. My first job was checking banknotes at the Bank of England printing works. They\u2019d come in reams of 500 and we\u2019d go through them quickly to find smeared numbers or print on the Queen\u2019s face. A woman on a high chair in the corner watched to make sure we didn\u2019t steal. When I got married at 19, I had to leave. I ran a sweet shop for years. The bestsellers were coconut mushrooms at tuppence a quarter. We used to get one or two men who\u2019d come in after they\u2019d been drinking, to kill the smell of the pub. Mints, mostly. I was working at the Whittington hospital as a clerk in 1965 when I was asked to run a new unit, the Bed Bureau, to find a hospital bed for anybody who needed it. We had a huge chart with every bed marked with a pin: when the bed was empty, we\u2019d take the pin out. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I was nominated for an MBE [for her work there]. I was thrilled to meet the Queen. I wore a pink floral skirt and a pink jacket. I retired a year later, in 1979, at 65. The saddest thing about getting old is you gradually lose bits of yourself. Your friends, brothers and sisters (I\u2019m the only one left), your mobility. I used to meet my daughter and we\u2019d go shopping or have coffee. We used to like Selfridges. But I can\u2019t go now because of my legs. The secret to a long life is taking things lightly, not worrying too much. Everyone has worries, but some people make theirs bigger.      Violet Butler: \u2018I\u2019m no paragon. I used to smoke and drink, but not to excess.\u2019 Photograph: David Bailey/Guardian    Violet Butler, 100, former store supervisor Violet Butler was born, the oldest of three, in London, where her father managed a gentlemen\u2019s outfitters. She married William in 1939 and was widowed in 1944. She has one surviving son, Colin, 69 (Bruce died in 2007, aged 65), six grandchildren, six great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren. Mothers never told you the facts of life then. You heard things whispered at school and I didn\u2019t believe half of it. I\u2019m damn sure when I had my first child, I wasn\u2019t sure where it was coming from. I was in the Middlesex hospital and the bombs were falling, and they just shoved me in a room and said, if you feel bad, breathe into this [gas and air]. It was quite a shock. I clicked with my father. He was from the farming side of the family, more down-to-earth. My mother was more church. She didn\u2019t have a lot to say, but she was a good mother. I was plump, not very special as a child. I liked school and fancied going into politics, as a Conservative. But we hadn\u2019t much money, so at 14 I started working in the shop, like it or not. I met William at a dance. He was 6ft 4in, so I called him Big Ben. He proposed at the top of the stairs in my parents\u2019 house. Bruce was born in 1942, Colin 18 months later. My husband came home for the christening, so he knew he had sons. They found his body on 19 June 1944, but it took a year for his identity to be confirmed. I\u2019d been told he was missing after the D-day landings, and for a year I still hoped he\u2019d turn up. He\u2019s buried at Tilly-sur-Seulles in Normandy; it\u2019s graves everywhere. I was 29 and had five shillings to my name. The army gave me a payment to tide me over. I\u2019d worked at Marks &amp; Spencer before I had the boys, so when Colin was five I went back. I became a supervisor and was still one when I retired at 60. I never remarried. I had offers, but the boys came first. The biggest compliment I\u2019ve ever had was when my son said, \u201cMum, you were always there.\u201d I\u2019ve never regretted it. You get lonely sometimes, but I\u2019ve worked and kept healthy, although now I\u2019m taking too many damn pills. I\u2019m no paragon. I used to smoke and drink, but not to excess. If anything goes wrong, I want to die quickly. If I go funny, I don\u2019t want to live on.

He married Dorothy, a factory inspector, in 1956, and was widowed in 1989. He has lived at the Royal Hospital Chelsea since 1994. We never saw our father. He was away all the time. Very hard man. They wouldn\u2019t put up with him these days. You\u2019d say, \u201cCan I go out, Dad?\u201d And he\u2019d say, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to play out in the streets.\u201d On the other hand, he never got drunk. He\u2019d go and play darts, perhaps in the British Legion. He played cards, brilliant, he was. That\u2019s where I get it from. I play bridge. I was a little sod as a boy, always fighting. Once I took on the bully of the school. \u201cYou want some trouble?\u201d I said. Boom! God, did he knock me out. When I was 14, I was a butcher\u2019s boy. I\u2019d deliver meat, and when I was about 18 or 19 I fell in love with this girl on my round. She was the housekeeper for an Italian vet. We got engaged, but when it came to getting married, her family wouldn\u2019t sign. If you were under 21 and you hadn\u2019t got permission, that was it. So she flew away and I joined the army. She broke my heart. When I joined up, this bloke pushed me, so thwack! Seven days confined to barracks. That\u2019s how I ended up boxing for the army. They came up and said, \u201cSo you like fighting.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d I boxed for the army at the Royal Albert Hall in 1933. I was good. I\u2019d done five and a half years in India when the war broke out. I was with the Royal Fusiliers doing guard duties in Delhi and Jhansi, and was due to come home on 10 October 1939. But the trumpet blew in September and the whole fourth Indian division sailed for Egypt. I was a dispatch rider in the desert, but I never took part in any fighting. In 1940 I joined the Liaison Regiment, a secret reconnaissance outfit known as Phantom. They chose me because I could drive any vehicle and shoot any weapon. I was in the A squadron, and the actor David Niven was also in A squadron. He was smashing. He said to me, \u201cWho do you fancy in Hollywood, Joe?\u201d I said, \u201cDorothy Lamour.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019ll see to it.\u201d I got a 6ft photograph of her, \u201cTo Joe, love from Dotty.\u201d I had a bad crash in 1944. I hit a patch of mud and the bike left me. I went up in the air, bang, fractured my spine and pelvis. I was in hospital for three months and they told me I\u2019d never walk again. I didn\u2019t get married until after the war. She was a London girl, cockney like me. All mouth and trousers. She was hyped, like a bloody strip hammer. The Hoover even came out on Christmas Day. We were married for 33 years and she died in five hours. She just complained of pain one night. We were sitting watching the box, and a doctor came and sprayed under her tongue. I said, \u201cIs she going to be all right in the night?\u201d He said, \u201cOh yeah. Tell her doctor that I suspect angina.\u201d A quarter of an hour later, she went pop. I own a horse in a syndicate, Ximbama, and bet on the horses every day. I go on the mobility scooter to Ladbrokes, round the corner. Today I\u2019ve bet on eight horses, \u00a31 each way. The most I\u2019ve ever won is \u00a3687, when four horses came in. Anything makes me happy, especially getting people into trouble. When breakfast is late, I get hold of my spoon and go bang! Bang! I\u2019m a stirrer, and I can\u2019t get out of the habit. \u2022 Joe Britton died on 27 October, shortly after the print version of this feature went to press.

She married Tom, a factory foreman, in 1940, and was widowed in 1970. She has a daughter, Val, one grandchild and two great-grandchildren. Edie We\u2019ve always been a close family and there\u2019s a lot of us left. My brother is 81, my sister is 87 and the other sister is 91. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secret. Just plain living and plain food. Sunday roasts used to be a regular, then just ordinary stews and steak and kidney pies. My mum was just lovely \u2013 looked after the children, we had her mother living with us. But I wasn\u2019t close to my dad. He used to drink. Emily and I were always close. I\u2019m the nervous type, she\u2019s more outgoing. But I was more with it \u2013 I\u2019d take control. We used to play in the street, hide and seek and skipping. Mum would call us and we\u2019d run away because we knew she was going to give us a pram with a baby in it. I left school at 14 and went to work for a little while at the Gordon\u2019s gin foundry, where Emily worked. We were in charge of putting labels on the bottles. I used to be scared of the forelady, Flo McCarthy. If it got too hot, then all the glue would come off the labels and they wouldn\u2019t go on the bottles. She\u2019d shout if you asked her for more glue. I was very happy when she left and Emily became the forelady. My happiest time was when I got married at 27. A friend made my dress and four bridesmaid dresses. It was thick smog. I had a white velvet dress with a train, and by the end it was brown. No one could see us come out of the church. Fred was an antique dealer in glass and china, but we didn\u2019t have any in our house. If I did like something, when I looked the next week, it would be gone, sold. He was a crew fitter in the Royal Air Force during the second world war, but didn\u2019t fight because there was something wrong with his foot. We didn\u2019t know what, but it was a lucky escape. One night there was heavy bombing in London. We were all in the air-raid shelter in the garden, and Fred was in the street knocking at the front door, and we couldn\u2019t hear him. The incendiaries were dropping all around him. It was Tom, Emily\u2019s husband, who let him in. But he would never go into the shelter. He stayed in the house. Always. Emily was only 56 when Tom died. It was a big shock. He was such a confident man and he was her world, so one half of her had gone, really. She came to live with us and used to look after herself upstairs. She came down at tea time and we\u2019d watch television together, and then she\u2019d go back up. She did try to live alone but it wasn\u2019t for her. Emily Mum was 93 when she died. Dad was 68, because he used to drink. It killed him. He wasn\u2019t violent. Actually, if he\u2019d had a drink, that was the only time we saw him smile. I was 19 when I went to work at Gordon\u2019s and stayed until I was 29. All that gin, and I never came home tipsy. We were particularly interested in the cocktail range \u2013 Bronx and Manhattan. If they were being made during the day, we\u2019d sneak a drop. I met my young man there, a foreman and stock controller. He was only little, about five foot six, but he was a lovely man. One year, when I was in my 50s, he gave me a fur coat. It came in this big box. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. Real fur! The worst thing about Gordon\u2019s was Flo McCarthy. No talking! Look at your labels! Nobody liked me when she left because then I was the boss. Losing Tom was terrible. I didn\u2019t like his family, so I moved in with Edie. We were always close. She\u2019s got one child, I\u2019ve got one child. It was quite difficult for us to conceive and we were older mums."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/02/richard-branson-ups-downs-transport-ventures", "sentences": ["It has lost \u00a3250m over the last four years, with Branson partly shielded from the losses through co-ownership of the airline with Singapore Airlines, which sold its 49% stake to Delta of the US for \u00a3224m in 2013.", "It was a considerable loss on a shareholding that Singapore bought from Branson for \u00a3600m in 1999."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-02T00:05:07Z", "title": "Richard Branson: the ups and downs of entrepreneur\u2019s transport ventures", "tags": ["Richard Branson", "Business", "Virgin Atlantic", "Airline industry", "World news"], "article": "Sir Richard Branson\u2019s transport ventures fall into two categories: vaultingly ambitious projects involving spacecraft, hot air balloons and speedboats; and safer bets in markets that are, or have been, partly protected. The former has generated yards of headlines, but the latter has yielded a fortune. Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic airline was portrayed as a punkish upstart when it took on British Airways in 1984, but for years BA and the tycoon\u2019s carrier enjoyed a privileged position as the only UK carriers allowed to fly between JFK and Heathrow \u2013 one of the world\u2019s most lucrative air routes. However, since the financial crisis \u2013 and the loss of that duopoly \u2013 Virgin Atlantic has struggled for profitability. It has lost \u00a3250m over the last four years, with Branson partly shielded from the losses through co-ownership of the airline with Singapore Airlines, which sold its 49% stake to Delta of the US for \u00a3224m in 2013. It was a considerable loss on a shareholding that Singapore bought from Branson for \u00a3600m in 1999. Branson told the Observer this month that Virgin Atlantic was set to return to profit this year and was targeting record profits by 2018 after cutting unprofitable routes and receiving new Boeing Dreamliner planes, although he admitted that delays in receiving the aircraft had damaged his business. \u201cWe had to rush in planes that we would rather not have offered our passengers, and it cost us a lot of money. When you\u2019re suddenly told you\u2019re not getting 20 planes, the customer service was not exactly as it should have been.\u201d His recent attempt at creating a domestic feeder airline, Little Red, met with failure and will be closed next year. Despite the new pull of space, Branson said after 30 years in the airline business \u201cit\u2019s still got the same joie de vivre\u201d and he was incredibly proud of his airline: \u201cIt\u2019s like a daughter to me\u201d. But the dowry is provided by rail. Branson has made an astonishing sum of money from the unglamorous business of operating a rail franchise, leased from the government. By 2017 he is expected to have taken away \u00a3300m in dividends from Virgin Rail, which operates the London-to-Glasgow Intercity West Coast route on an exclusive contract. Since taking over the route in 1997, Virgin has shared \u00a3499m in dividends from the business with co-owner Stagecoach. The route\u2019s financial success was buoyed by a contract renegotiation with the government in 2006 that was widely seen to have been generous for Branson and Stagecoach, much to the chagrin of Department for Transport officials. The DfT re-let the franchise to FirstGroup in 2012, turfing Branson out of the rail business, only to be forced to return it to Virgin when the process was deemed flawed. Under the current deal, Branson will run the route until 2017 with the possibility of a further one-year extension. Whether seeking ministerial backing for Heathrow landing slots or winning rail franchise extensions, one of Branson\u2019s best entrepreneurial gambits has been securing concessions or business from the government of the day. He bought Northern Rock from the state for \u00a3747m and his Virgin Care business provides NHS community health services in Surrey and Devon. Along with co-investor Aabar Investments of Abu Dhabi, Branson has sunk $500m into Virgin Galactic. But his successes in more bankable fields have provided some ample compensation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/02/rapid-carbon-emission-cuts-severe-impact-climate-change-ipcc-report", "sentences": ["\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2014 to remove a picture of Singapore because the caption said: \u201cSingapore shrouded by a haze as carbon emissions soar\u201d."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-02T13:23:35Z", "title": "IPCC: rapid carbon emission cuts vital to stop severe impact of climate change", "tags": ["Climate change", "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "Environment", "Global climate talks", "Energy", "Energy industry", "Renewable energy", "Nuclear power", "Fossil fuels", "Coal", "United Nations", "World news"], "article": "Climate change is set to inflict \u201csevere, widespread, and irreversible impacts\u201d on people and the natural world unless carbon emissions are cut sharply and rapidly, according to the most important assessment of global warming yet published.

There is no ambiguity in the message,\u201d said the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, attending what he described as the \u201chistoric\u201d report launch. \u201cLeaders must act. Time is not on our side.\u201d He said that quick, decisive action would build a better and sustainable future, while inaction would be costly. Ban added a message to investors, such as pension fund managers: \u201cPlease reduce your investments in the coal- and fossil fuel-based economy and [move] to renewable energy.\u201d The report, released in Copenhagen on Sunday by the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), is the work of thousands of scientists and was agreed after negotiations by the world\u2019s governments. It is the first IPCC report since 2007 to bring together all aspects of tackling climate change and for the first time states: that it is economically affordable; that carbon emissions will ultimately have to fall to zero; and that global poverty can only be reduced by halting global warming. The report also makes clear that carbon emissions, mainly from burning coal, oil and gas, are currently rising to record levels, not falling. The report comes at a critical time for international action on climate change, with the deadline for a global deal just over a year away. In September, 120 national leaders met at the UN in New York to address climate change, while hundreds of thousands of marchers around the world demanded action.       \u201cWe have the means to limit climate change,\u201d said Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the IPCC. \u201cThe solutions are many and allow for continued economic and human development. All we need is the will to change.\u201d  Lord Nicholas Stern, a professor at the London School of Economics and the author of an influential earlier study, said the new IPCC report was the \u201cmost important assessment of climate change ever prepared\u201d and that it made plain that \u201cfurther delays in tackling climate change would be dangerous and profoundly irrational\u201d.  \u201cThe reality of climate change is undeniable, and cannot be simply wished away by politicians who lack the courage to confront the scientific evidence,\u201d he said, adding that the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people were at risk. Ed Davey, the UK energy and climate change secretary, said: \u201cThis is the most comprehensive and robust assessment ever produced. It sends a clear message: we must act on climate change now. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said: \u201cThis is another canary in the coal mine. We can\u2019t prevent a large scale disaster if we don\u2019t heed this kind of hard science.\u201d Bill McKibben, a high-profile climate campaigner with 350.org, said: \u201cFor scientists, conservative by nature, to use \u2018serious, pervasive, and irreversible\u2019 to describe the effects of climate falls just short of announcing that climate change will produce a zombie apocalypse plus random beheadings plus Ebola.\u201d Breaking the power of the fossil fuel industry would not be easy, McKibben said. \u201cBut, thanks to the IPCC, no one will ever be able to say they weren\u2019t warned.\u201d The new overarching IPCC report builds on previous reports on the science, impacts and solutions for climate change. It concludes that global warming is \u201cunequivocal\u201d, that humanity\u2019s role in causing it is \u201cclear\u201d and that many effects will last for hundreds to thousands of years even if the planet\u2019s rising temperature is halted. In terms of impacts, such as heatwaves and extreme rain storms causing floods, the report concludes that the effects are already being felt: \u201cIn recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems on all continents and across the oceans.\u201d  Droughts, coastal storm surges from the rising oceans and wildlife extinctions on land and in the seas will all worsen unless emissions are cut, the report states. This will have knock-on effects, according to the IPCC: \u201cClimate change is projected to undermine food security.\u201d The report also found the risk of wars could increase: \u201cClimate change can indirectly increase risks of violent conflicts by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts such as poverty and economic shocks.\u201d Two-thirds of all the emissions permissible if dangerous climate change is to be avoided have already been pumped into the atmosphere, the IPPC found. The lowest cost route to stopping dangerous warming would be for emissions to peak by 2020 \u2013 an extremely challenging goal \u2013 and then fall to zero later this century.  The report calculates that to prevent dangerous climate change, investment in low-carbon electricity and energy efficiency will have to rise by several hundred billion dollars a year before 2030. But it also found that delaying significant emission cuts to 2030 puts up the cost of reducing carbon dioxide by almost 50%, partly because dirty power stations would have to be closed early. \u201cIf you wait, you also have to do more difficult and expensive things,\u201d said Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and an IPCC working group vice-chair.     The coal-fired Scherer plant in operation in Juliette, Georgia. Photograph: John Amis/AP    Tackling climate change need only trim economic growth rates by a tiny fraction, the IPCC states, and may actually improve growth by providing other benefits, such as cutting health-damaging air pollution. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) \u2013 the nascent technology which aims to bury CO2 underground \u2013 is deemed extremely important by the IPPC. It estimates that the cost of the big emissions cuts required would more than double without CCS. Pachauri said: \u201cWith CCS it is entirely possible for fossil fuels to continue to be used on a large scale.\u201d The focus on CCS is not because the technology has advanced a great deal in recent years, said Jean-Pascal van Ypersele, a professor at the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain in Belgium and vice-chair of the IPCC, but because emissions have continued to increase so quickly. \u201cWe have emitted so much more, so we have to clean up more later\u201d, he said.  Linking CCS to the burning of wood and other plant fuels would reduce atmospheric CO2 levels because the carbon they contain is sucked from the air as they grow. But van Ypersele said the IPCC report also states \u201cvery honestly and fairly\u201d that there are risks to this approach, such as conflicts with food security. In contrast to the importance the IPCC gives to CCS, abandoning nuclear power or deploying only limited wind or solar power increases the cost of emission cuts by just 6-7%. The report also states that behavioural changes, such as dietary changes that could involve eating less meat, can have a role in cutting emissions. As part of setting out how the world\u2019s nations can cut emissions effectively, the IPCC report gives prominence to ethical considerations. \u201c[Carbon emission cuts] and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice, and fairness,\u201d says the report. \u201cThe evidence suggests that outcomes seen as equitable can lead to more effective [international] cooperation.\u201d  These issues are central to the global climate change negotiations and their inclusion in the report was welcomed by campaigners, as was the statement that adapting countries and coastlines to cope with global warming cannot by itself avert serious impacts. \u201cRich governments must stop making empty promises and come up with the cash so the poorest do not have to foot the bill for the lifestyles of the wealthy,\u201d said Harjeet Singh, from ActionAid.  The statement that carbon emissions must fall to zero was \u201cgamechanging\u201d, according to Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. \u201cWe can still limit warming to 2C, or even 1.5C or less even, [but] we need to phase out emissions,\u201d she said. Unlike CCS, which is yet to be proven commercially, she said renewable energy was falling rapidly in cost. Sam Smith, from WWF, said: \u201cThe big change in this report is that it shows fighting climate change is not going to cripple economies and that it is essential to bringing people out of poverty. What is needed now is concerted political action.\u201d The rapid response of politicians to the recent global financial crisis showed, according to Smith, that \u201cthey could act quickly and at scale if they are sufficiently motivated\u201d. Michel Jarraud, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation, said the much greater certainty expressed in the new IPCC report would give international climate talks a better chance than those which failed in 2009. \u201cIgnorance can no longer be an excuse for no action,\u201d he said. Observers played down the moves made by some countries with large fossil fuel reserves to weaken the language of the draft IPCC report written by scientists and seen by the Guardian, saying the final report was conservative but strong. However, the statement that \u201cclimate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions, including greater likelihood of death\u201d was deleted in the final report, along with criticism that politicians sometimes \u201cengage in short-term thinking and are biased toward the status quo\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2014 to remove a picture of Singapore because the caption said: \u201cSingapore shrouded by a haze as carbon emissions soar\u201d. The haze in the picture was caused by forest fires.

Business Insider UK, which has about 10 staff, is the seventh international version after launches in countries including Australia, China, Singapore and Malaysia through partnerships. The UK site, which is edited by Business Insider veteran Jim Edwards, will focus on the core sectors of finance, technology, politics and strategy. However, Henry Blodget, the co-founder and chief executive of Business Insider, said the seven-year-old US-based company has reached the scale and has the financial muscle to look to launch new digital content brands outside of its core area of business and financial news. The company has investors including Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of the Washington Post, RRE Ventures and Institutional Venture Partners. \u201cI do expect the industry to consolidate at some point,\u201d said Blodget, speaking in London ahead of Tuesday\u2019s UK launch. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether we will be consolidated or we will be a consolidator. The bigger we get and the more we have invested in technology and sales, the more sense it makes for us to consider having other publications in the company focusing on different markets other than business. That is very typical in media companies, most TV companies have several networks for example.\u201d While launching new brands might be on the strategic horizon, a more pressing concern will be taking on the UK digital operations of rivals including the Financial Times, Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal Europe. Blodget said Business Insider UK will be \u201ccomplementary and competitive\u201d with the FT, but his general view is that traditional print publishers are not at the leading edge of the digital revolution. \u201cWe are a native digital business publication,\u201d he said. \u201cOur model is better serving digital readers than the digital operations of a lot of traditional companies. It is not the thrust of the publication for a lot of traditional publishers \u2013 digital is a secondary concern. We are reaching a new generation of readers \u2026 10 years younger than competitors. We are not trying to be a newspaper, we are not trying to produce TV journalism. We are 100% focused on digital.\u201d The company is aiming to significantly grow the amount of web traffic it receives from the UK \u2013 currently 5% of global usage \u2013 and he is not too concerned about the impact of the deep-pocketed BBC digital news service. \u201cThe BBC could never exist in the US,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is so much anti-government, anti-tax, anti-media sentiment. People would run out with pitchforks and torches if you proposed such a thing. \u201cThe BBC has a wonderful digital offering but they are not that focused on business. And, again, there is room for dozens and dozens of big organisations to exist in digital. [Taking] a tiny fraction of BBC\u2019s readers, or anyone\u2019s readers would be great for us. I\u2019d be thrilled.\u201d When AOL paid $315m (\u00a3197m) for the Huffington Post in 2011, which was a similar size to Business Insider at the time of the sale, it was considered by some observers to be a pricey deal that would be unlikely to be repeated. \u201cPeople said that, but now on pretty much any measure you look at BuzzFeed would be worth way more than that,\u201d Blodget said. \u201cAnd Vice Media was just valued at $2.5bn \u2013 so that HuffPo number may end up looking quite small.\u201d Blodget added that tech startups have always been seen as sexy by investors, but it has taken a long time for the opportunity provided by digital media businesses to be realised. \u201cThe development cycle of media brands and media companies is a different growth path than technology,\u201d he said. \u201cImportantly, you now have investors and traditional media companies realising digital media is very viable as an economic proposition and is only likely to become more so over the next 10, 20, 30 years as the digital [generations] mature. Not all digital publications swill succeed, not by a long shot, but some will and they will ultimately be worth quite a bit.\u201d  \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Responding to recent and mounting speculation that Button will lose his seat to Fernando Alonso next year, Hamilton said: \u201cJenson is better than most drivers here. He\u2019s a great driver. So it doesn\u2019t correlate. If I had a team I would want him in it. He\u2019s a great asset for any team. It\u2019s not that McLaren need a better driver. There are not many out there. They need a better car.\u201d McLaren and their new engine supplier, Honda, are desperate to land Alonso, who is still probably the best all-round driver in Formula One, though they have not managed to sign him yet. Button\u2019s manager, Richard Goddard, said on Thursday: \u201cI spoke to Ron [Dennis, the McLaren principal] this morning and he hasn\u2019t confirmed that Fernando has signed. And he says he still hasn\u2019t decided about who will fill the other seat. He\u2019s been completely open with me.\u201d But assuming McLaren do sign Alonso, Button would be likely to lose out to his younger team-mate Kevin Magnussen. Money, as ever, is a factor. Button earns an estimated \u00a310m whereas Magnussen is thought to be on \u00a3500,000. Button refused to confirm that the race in Abu Dhabi on 23 November would be his last. But there was still a suggestion of the valedictory in his body language and in what he said when he spoke outside the McLaren motorhome on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange situation,\u201d he said. \u201cMcLaren need to make a decision. This is a massive part of my life, Formula One and motor racing has been. And it\u2019s not going to stop. It will continue. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where that\u2019s going to be right now. I never feel like I\u2019m being pushed out of the sport because I\u2019m definitely going to be in it in some shape or form, and it\u2019s going to be a massive challenge, and very exciting.\u201d Button, 34, says his likely departure is not age-related. \u201cRon told me I could do it for ever, never let age be a factor. That\u2019s what he told me last year. Age is not a factor in this sport. The cars are getting easier to drive, physically. \u201cMentally and technically, probably not. But physically we could all drive with one hand these days. It\u2019s not a challenge. The only track that is a challenge is Singapore. It\u2019s got easier and easier over the years.\u201d Button is the most experienced driver in F1, with 264 grands prix. He won the world championship in 2009 and joined McLaren the following year. He added: \u201cThe bit that hurts more than anything is not having a quick car. Two years of not winning is too long. Our last win was here two years ago, and that is a long time for a team like McLaren that has won world championships and is used to winning grands prix.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/07/standard-chartered-chairman-john-peace-bank-humility", "sentences": ["His remarks, made to 300 of the bank\u2019s senior managers in Singapore this week, emerged as the bank\u2019s management team were preparing to deliver three days of presentations to investors to convince them there is a coherent plan to bolster returns."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-07T18:35:06Z", "title": "Standard Chartered not broken, just in for 10-year service, says chairman", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Business", "UK news", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Sir John Peace, chairman of Standard Chartered, has said the embattled bank can turn round its performance without a radical overhaul \u2013 although he conceded that it needs to show more humility.

The last fatal accident was on 26 October 2013 when Mr Siyabonga Sibango succumbed to his injuries after an underground vehicle accident.\u201d Obviously, the announcement that nobody has been killed at its operations for a year represents decent news for the group\u2019s employees and their families. However one wonders, before its results this week, if Lonmin might now moderate the crowing. Eight days after unveiling that positive news, it emerged that a South African judicial commission of inquiry will hear arguments from Nelson Mandela\u2019s former lawyer about how Lonmin execs should be investigated as accomplices to murder for their role in a 2012 police massacre of 34 striking mine workers. Oddly, the group seems less keen on press releases about that. \u201cLonmin has consistently said that it would not publicly comment on evidence as it is given [to the commission],\u201d it blocks. \u201cThis stance, whilst the right thing to do, has occasionally meant the company has been unable to deal with false or misleading allegations as they have emerged.\u201d\u200b Who\u2019d have thought it?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/nov/09/build-infrastructure-jobs-north-south-divide", "sentences": ["That admission came in a leak of remarks Sir John Peace made to 300 senior managers in Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-09T00:05:04Z", "title": "Wherever you build new infrastructure, jobs will follow.

The government is keen, funding can only be described as ultra-cheap and there is a long list of projects waiting on the runway \u2013 not least extra airport capacity in the south-east. The Airports Commission, headed by Sir Howard Davies, will deliver its verdict this week on expanding Gatwick or Heathrow, while reserving judgment on a winner until after the election. The dither and delay surrounding the decision appears to be symptomatic of a more general malaise. One factor getting in the way is the UK\u2019s huge stock of wealth. Building an airport extension, new railway or road means knocking down expensive homes or tracking across beautiful (and expensive) countryside. Never have our homes and fields meant so much in cash terms. To dig them up does not just mean losing a lovely vista, but also taking a hit on a substantial investment. The high-speed rail link from London to Birmingham could be ready by 2026, according to its supporters. That seems unlikely when there are disputes up and down the route long before the start of work in 2017. Solihull, the location of some of the West Midlands\u2019s most expensive streets, recently joined the list of objectors after it noticed that a train depot was to be sited on its doorstep. Further south, the fight is equally dirty. The people of Oxfordshire and the Chilterns have stepped up demands for compensation and longer tunnels. Inside Whitehall, rail transport is considered one of the most important elements of infrastructure. London\u2019s \u00a315bn Crossrail project kept going despite the financial crisis and subsequent recession. More than \u00a39bn was spent on an upgrade of the west coast main line. A \u00a37.5bn upgrade of the Great Western route is ongoing. Transport for London remains one of the best funded public sector organisations in the country. One reason train lines are popular is the quantifiable payback. Passengers will travel on newer trains in increasing numbers and tolerate higher fares. Another is the political ease of tunnelling and upgrading, as opposed to building new overground routes. Roads have proved trickier. For a start, where\u2019s the payback? The CBI, which is lobbying for a new road under Stonehenge on the A303, has toyed with tolls. But there is an inbuilt resistance to paying for an upgraded road when the old one was free. Business lobby groups now favour an independent infrastructure body to clear the path for new roads and rail, energy upgrades and super-fast digital. Such a body, free of political interference, could deliver a national infrastructure plan, they argue. Yet this plan, like the idea of bribing homeowners and businesses to favour development, bows to Britain\u2019s laissez-faire economy and its constant drift to the south and east. Infrastructure follows people and that means most schemes are earmarked for London and the south-east (see Crossrail 2, a north-south route linking Wimbledon and Alexandra Palace). Rather than spending billions of pounds widening the arteries of the south-east\u2019s economy, we should switch the funding northwards. Rather than treating as an afterthought plans to link Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, they should be centre stage. With the population growing, housing, new schools, sewers and power stations will be easier and cheaper to build in the north. Only when we improve the infrastructure support around the conurbations of the north-east and west will jobs and people follow. If jobseekers can be directed north, much of London\u2019s infrastructure will last another few decades without any extra expense. Boris Johnson will never agree, but his cycle highways in the sky and underground ring roads are all designed to cope with London attracting millions more people. What if they headed up the M1 to a new life? Standard needs Sands to be strong Had Peter Sands left Standard Chartered a year ago, he would have departed as a minor banking hero. True, there was the horrible blemish of a \u00a3415m fine from a New York regulator for hiding transactions with Iran, but the eight-year tally was excellent. Standard breezed through the industry\u2019s 2007-09 crisis, and not only because of its concentration in emerging markets. It seemed to have the right stuff \u2013 a conservative culture and a firm grasp of risk. Now Sands finds himself fighting to stay as chief executive. The shares have almost halved since their 2013 high and trade slightly below book value, a humiliating comedown. This week\u2019s three-day presentation to investors in Hong Kong is a make-or-break moment. Fluff it and fund managers\u2019 grumbles of discontent may turn to open calls for boardroom change. Sands must convince on two fronts. The first is basic: are bad loans under control? The scary figure in last month\u2019s third-quarter update was the surge in impairments to $539m (\u00a3340m), up $250m on a year ago. \u201cWe remain watchful in India, in China and of commodity exposures more broadly,\u201d said the bank. Too vague. Shareholders want a detailed appraisal of loans to big Asian companies. Then there\u2019s capital. In theory, it\u2019s not a problem. Standard has the second highest capital ratio among major UK banks. But it used to have the highest, and the City worries about a dividend cut or rights issue to kickstart growth. Sands plans to removecut $400m of costs. But is that enough at an organisation even the chairman admits is bureaucratic? That admission came in a leak of remarks Sir John Peace made to 300 senior managers in Singapore. The leak points to other worries. Has Standard lost its sense of unity? Do Sands\u2019s own lieutenants think he is yesterday\u2019s man? Did January\u2019s reshuffle, which saw the exit of finance director Richard Meddings, upset the bank\u2019s mojo? There is no obvious internal successor. But Standard, in its current state, cannot afford to have a chief executive who looks like a dead man walking. Sands must impress in Hong Kong. The alternative is a crisis of confidence. Difficult price point for Coupe Hold on to your hats. This week Sainsbury\u2019s boss Mike Coupe will set out how he intends to tackle the \u201cperfect storm\u201d of problems he has warned is sweeping through the supermarket sector. No longer are punters piling their trolleys high in big stores. Instead they are popping fewer items into their baskets, shopping more often and looking for cheaper deals. Coupe promised last month he would \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d. It is a tricky challenge: Coupe is not really the new boy, even though he only took charge in July. He was the key lieutenant of former boss Justin King and, unlike his rival at embattled Tesco, he cannot pin blame on his predecessors. But he cannot afford to cling to the past. Sainsbury\u2019s has never enjoyed competing hard on price. The City is waiting to find out how far Coupe is prepared to slash prices to keep customers."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/10/kurt-geiger-london-opens-flagship-store", "sentences": ["Kurt Geiger has opened 28 stores this year, including 20 in the UK and a flagship store in Milan, while franchise partners opened flagship stores in Thailand, Hong Kong, China and Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-10T00:01:08Z", "title": "Kurt Geiger to open flagship London store as sales step up", "tags": ["Retail industry", "Fashion", "Life and style", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Kurt Geiger will add a London flagship store early next year to its growing empire of shoe shops around the world following a jump in sales boosted by its Bond &amp; Britton heels and Saffiano handbags. The British luxury brand, whose shoes are worn by stars including Beyonc\u00e9 and Julia Roberts, reported a 13% increase in like-for-like sales for the third quarter, bucking a tough retail climate. Many clothes retailers have blamed the weather for sluggish sales, including Next, one of Britain\u2019s most successful retailers.

Alongside its Bond &amp; Britton high heel court shoes, priced at \u00a3250 to \u00a3295 a pair, casual shoes such as slip-ons and flats are proving increasingly popular among customers. The firm has branched out into handbags and other accessories such as jewellery, and phone and tablet cases. It credited the launch of the Saffiano leather range with a 50% rise in handbag sales so far this year \u2013 especially after British model and actor Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was seen carrying the red Saffiano bowling bag in Hollywood. American actors Jon Hamm and Channing Tatum have been spotted wearing Kurt Geiger\u2019s men\u2019s collection. The shoe retailer was bought out by its chief executive, Neil Clifford, and other managers in April with the backing of US private equity house Sycamore Partners, to which it had been sold as part of the Jones Group in a $1.2bn (\u00a3750m) deal. Clifford talked of a \u201ctremendous year\u201d for Kurt Geiger. \u201cFollowing our management buyout, the company\u2019s new strategic direction has facilitated a renewed focus on growth and international expansion.\u201d He said the company was trying to appeal to everyone, from Hollywood stars to fashion-aware shoppers. Its Shoeaholics website sells men\u2019s boots from \u00a329 and court and flat shoes from \u00a319. Like-for-like sales at the retailer are up 13% in the first seven months of this year, taking gross turnover to \u00a3210m, compared with \u00a3230m for the whole of last year. A fifth of sales are now made via the internet, following 30% online growth. Kurt Geiger has opened 28 stores this year, including 20 in the UK and a flagship store in Milan, while franchise partners opened flagship stores in Thailand, Hong Kong, China and Singapore. It now has 59 independent shops worldwide and 198 department store concessions. In the UK, a store in Bicester Village shopping centre is due to open in December, followed by a London flagship in the Oxford Street area early next year. It also runs multi-branded shoe departments in Selfridges and Liberty and opened Harrods Shoe Heaven in August, which stocks more than 50 brands including Manolo Blahnik, Saint Laurent and Valentino. Kurt Geiger has made a three-year commitment to Cordwainers\u2019 College at the London College of Fashion, which has trained shoemakers and leather workers since 1887 and produced designers such as Jimmy Choo and Charlotte Olympia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network-outbrain-partner-zone/2014/nov/10/outbrain-rising-stars-interview-with-neal-moore-click2view", "sentences": ["When I lived in London I used to go to a lot of live music and comedy gigs in pubs; in Singapore I spend more time at the theatre for fun and in conferences for business - all of which are great sources of content."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-10T10:18:17Z", "title": "Outbrain rising stars \u2013 interview with Neal Moore, Click2View", "tags": ["Outbrain partner zone Rising stars 2014"], "article": "What are you most excited about in the digital marketing space at the moment? The crumbling of divisions between brands, content creators and audiences, which has led to an explosion in creativity and opportunities for artists, writers, designers, directors, actors and musicians who have long struggled to break into the old media \u201cestablishment\u201d. The old media calls this \u201cdisruption\u201d but for brands it\u2019s a huge opportunity not to be missed.  What\u2019s your favourite example of innovative digital marketing? We\u2019re starting to see some really worthwhile branded content appear not just in digital but on TV and in movie theatres too. I\u2019d highly recommend watching the Harman Audio documentary \u201cDistortion of Sound\u201d, the Jude Law-starring Johnnie Walker film \u201cGentleman\u2019s Wager\u201d and, of course, the Lego Movie if you\u2019ve not see it yet! Where do you go for great content? All over the place \u2013 it depends on what I\u2019m looking for and whether I\u2019m offline or online.  Offline I love book shops, second hand record stores and coffee shops with stacks of magazines that I might not otherwise buy but pick up and flick through, which often leads to unexpected discoveries. When I lived in London I used to go to a lot of live music and comedy gigs in pubs; in Singapore I spend more time at the theatre for fun and in conferences for business - all of which are great sources of content. I also read The Straits Times paper edition of a weekend and Intelligent Life magazine when I find it.  Online I like the Guardian for UK and global news, Fast Company for business (especially their Create section), Spotify for new music, iTunes &amp; Netflix for TV and movies, YouTube and Vimeo for talent spotting and The Chive for just killing time. Oh, and Google when I don\u2019t know what I want. What\u2019s next for digital content? Lots of things! But I\u2019m most interested in how technology is continuing to disrupt old media models by democratising the means of content creation, distribution and consumption. This has given rise to a greater variety of content creators and niches as well as new formats such as transmedia storytelling and mass personalised video. All of this can be targeted and tracked with increasing accuracy, which is attractive to brands and the next generation of media companies including Click2View because we can reduce wastage and increase ROI for our clients. What defines good content? What defines good content depends on its objective. If your content is supposed to be funny but it doesn\u2019t make me laugh then it has failed its objective and is therefore no good. Before embarking on any kind of content the creator must first decide what their objective is, all further decisions should be based on how best to serve that objective. Bad content happens when there is either no objective or, more commonly, the objective becomes compromised or simply forgotten during the production process. What is the biggest myth about content marketing? That \u201cit\u2019s all about storytelling\u201d, which is not necessarily true. What\u2019s the story behind Charlie Bit My Finger? There isn\u2019t one and that\u2019s the case with the most viral content such as sneezing pandas or fainting goats. Also, you may have a great story but if you can\u2019t tell it with style or conviction then who cares? I once knew a guy who worked security for Guns &amp; Roses and revived a half-dead Axl Rose before a concert! It\u2019s a great story, but the way he told it could put you into a coma. That\u2019s why artists are worth their weight in gold - they can tell a story with style. How are you amplifying and maximising your content?  First, let me say that releasing your content without amplification is about as effective as releasing a fart in a wind tunnel \u2013 no one will notice. There is just too much content out there to leave it to chance that someone will find and engage with yours so make sure your headlines are striking, your descriptions compelling, your search terms relevant and that you have ring-fenced some budget for paid amplification from the likes of Outbrain who can put your content in the midst of the world\u2019s most prestigious publications.

I turned on the radio and heard the education secretary speaking. It took a while to work out her identity; her voice was unfamiliar and she was talking about her subsidiary portfolio, women\u2019s issues. The fact that she was unrecognisable was revealing. The policy of becalming the education world in the run-up to the general election is clearly working. It could be argued (and is self-evidently the view inside government) that a period of quiet contemplation, implementation and remoralisation is still necessary after all those relentless reforms and gimmicky initiatives. Although the latter can have a comical flip side. Whoever dreamed up Labour\u2019s policy of a Hippocratic oath for teachers clearly hadn\u2019t remembered the power of citizen journalists and social media to instantly disable ill-thought-through ideas. But Tory silence, or Labour\u2019s \u201cjob done if we get on the six o\u2019clock news\u201d approach, isn\u2019t good enough. Two weeks ago Estelle Morris rightly wrote about the muddled thinking of the past four years. But dealing with the legacy of botched ideas is only half the story. It\u2019s not that I miss Michael Gove\u2019s foghorn communication with the outside world (although it did give us lots to write about), but he did at least have a narrative based on deeply held, if misguided, views. As the election nears, we need a different but equally passionate vision, not just for schools but for children and their place in society. Last week I gave a lecture at St Hilda\u2019s college in Oxford, based on the historian RH Tawney\u2019s suggestion that: \u201cWhat a wise parent should wish for their children, the state should wish for all its children.\u201d Re-reading much of the evidence about the multiple influences that determine whether children thrive personally as well as academically was instructive. What becomes blindingly obvious, and is hardly new, is that we must stop obsessing on school type, focus on the quality of teachers and heads and take a more holistic approach to children. Gove\u2019s decision to remove the words \u201cchildren\u201d and \u201cfamilies\u201d from the name of his department looks increasingly flawed. There is a 19-month gap in cognitive skills between children eligible for free school meals and those who are not when they start school. So rather than aspiring to recreate the characteristics of the secondary schools our pale, male politicians went to, we should be prioritising high-quality early years education and care, family support and parenting and parent education. Of course literacy, numeracy and robust qualifications matter, but so do character, creativity, resilience, self-esteem, perseverance and confidence. As England fixates on what can be measured and examined, talks down its teachers, and even more bizarrely argues about whether they should be qualified at all, our competitors around the world are investing relentlessly in their teaching workforce and exploring new ways of valuing personal, social and emotional development alongside academic work. In Singapore, a new curriculum for character and citizenship education has just been introduced. At its heart are core values of care, respect, resilience and harmony, leading to core competencies: self-awareness, management of relationships, responsible decision-making. And no, this is not coming from the lips of a wishy-washy progressive teacher spawned by Gove\u2019s \u201cblob\u201d, but is an integral part of the national development of a country right at the top of those international league tables we aspire to emulate. Policy proposals about the content of the Ofsted framework, the battle of the middle tiers (commissioners versus local authorities versus independent directors), and (yawn) more competition only matter in relation to how they further these wider aims of good teaching, a broad curriculum and better support for children and their families. I would even suggest the creation of a minister with responsibility for children across government, to undertake the role Nicky Morgan appears to be rather blandly pursuing on behalf of women, and to stand up to wider social policies, like the housing benefit cap, which have led one mother to the supreme court, after she was forced to put her children into foster care so they could continue their education while she moved 55 miles away to live in temporary accommodation. The government defends this particular horror on the grounds that it will make the country more prosperous and fair. Prosperous and fair are good, evocative words and they should be part of a bigger vision. But they will never be truly reflective of this country until we have proper polices for children that include but also go beyond schools."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/11/unions-call-for-halt-in-tpp-negotiations-so-that-agreement-can-be-scrutinised", "sentences": ["The countries include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-11T08:57:07Z", "title": "Unions call for halt in TPP negotiations so that agreement can be scrutinised", "tags": ["Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Unions", "Australian trade unions", "Coalition", "Tony Abbott"], "article": "The world\u2019s largest trade union federation has joined Australian unions in calling on Tony Abbott and the other 11 government leaders to stop negotiations on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement. The letter from the International Trade Union Confederation and the ACTU says leaked excerpts of TPP negotiations suggest the inclusion of controversial clauses, which they believe could cost the jobs of their members. The clauses include: \u2022 the investor state dispute clause (ISDS), which opponents say can help multinationals to undermine social policies;  \u2022patent protections which would make medicines more expensive; \u2022 and restrictions on national financial regulation; The TPP leaked excerpts also show a failure to take climate change into account, the unions say.  Reflecting the concerns of Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan, trade unions say the secrecy of negotiations mean it is impossible to scrutinise the trade agreement for its effect on the Australian population. \u201cKeeping the negotiating texts and mandates away from public scrutiny is not an acceptable practice for a \u201821st century agreement\u2019 that aspires to set a \u2018gold standard\u2019,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIn order to create balanced and inclusive trade agreements, governments must publish relevant documents that will enable parliaments and civil society to contribute as well as warn against potential dangers from an early stage and certainly well before agreements have been concluded.\u201d  The letter is signed by Sharan Burrow, a former president of the ACTU and now general secretary of the ITUC and Ged Kearney, current ACTU president. The government is currently negotiating the TPP, which involves 12 countries and which aims to expand trade and investment in the region. The countries include Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. Abbott discussed the TPP with US president Barack Obama on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit on Monday night. The last negotiation round was held in Canberra in August this year. Asked why the union movement was speaking out now as opposed to when a Labor government was negotiating the TPP in 2010, ACTU secretary Dave Oliver said the union movement had always objected to secret negotiations of trade deals. He said although the Labor government\u2019s labour market tests in free trade agreements with Malaysia, New Zealand and Asean were weak, they were \u201csomething\u201d. Since then, Oliver said the Abbott government had removed labour market testing in the Korean free trade agreement, which effectively allowed overseas workers into Australia without companies advertising for local workers first. He said it was a good indication that similar provisions were likely to be in the TPP and the Chinese free trade agreement. \u201cThe problem is (Australia) is negotiating this agreement but it is not a level playing field while other countries give their industries preferential treatment. And while Australia has previously dropped tariffs, it was done in return for industry policy but that is now gone,\u201d said Oliver. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson, who has constantly opposed Australia\u2019s involvement in the TPP, welcomed the fact that the unions \u201chad finally woken up\u201d that trade deals like the TPP and the China FTA would fundamentally limit Australia\u2019s ability to set domestic policy. \u201cThe unions are right to call for a stop in negotiations so that an informed public debate can be held about the costs of these deals,\u201d said Whish-Wilson. \u201cIf Labor was serious about supporting their union base, they would also back a stop in the negotiations. I think the unions have woken up to the fact that they can\u2019t trust Labor to represent their interests in trade deals, full stop. \u201cWhen Labor recently voted to pass the Korean Free Trade, a deal that helped kill off the car industry and included the dangerous and undemocratic ISDS provisions, it was a signal to the unions that they can no longer rely on the Labor party to have their back.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/12/russian-naval-vessels-on-move-north-of-australia-in-leadup-to-g20", "sentences": ["\u201cRussian naval vessels have previously been deployed in conjunction with major international summits, such as the Apec meeting in Singapore in 2009,\u201d the ADF said."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-12T09:27:15Z", "title": "Russian naval vessels on move north of Australia in leadup to G20", "tags": ["Russia", "Australian defence force", "Vladimir Putin", "G20", "G20 Brisbane 2014", "Australia news", "Tony Abbott"], "article": "Russian naval vessels are on the move north of Australia, days before the G20 summit in Brisbane and at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and Canberra.

Seven News reported that Australia had dispatched a P-3 Orion surveillance aircraft and the Anzac-class frigate HMAS Stuart to monitor the four Russian ships, which were said to be in the Coral Sea south of Bougainville and heading towards Australian waters.

On Wednesday, Russia dismissed Australia\u2019s call for an apology and compensation over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as premature and \u201cinvalid\u201d. Putin met with the Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Beijing on Tuesday. Abbott has previously strongly criticised Russia over its alleged role in the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane over eastern Ukraine in July. The prime minister\u2019s office said Abbott had told Putin that Australia \u201cwas in possession of information suggesting that MH17 was destroyed by a missile from a launcher that had come out of Russia, was fired from inside eastern Ukraine and then returned to Russia\u201d. According to Canberra\u2019s account of the 15-minute meeting, Abbott said the US had \u201cduly apologised and made appropriate restitution\u201d after it shot down an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 and \u201che commended the precedent to President Putin\u201d. In that case, involving an American naval warship in the Gulf, the US government expressed its regret rather than issuing a full apology, and reached a compensation settlement eight years later. A spokesman for the Russian embassy, Alexander Odoevskiy, said the comparison with the Iranian aircraft was invalid. Odoevskiy said Russia and Australia agreed on the importance of an impartial international investigation into the circumstances of MH17 but Moscow believed the investigation should be concluded before claims of culpability were made. \u201cOur position that if Australia has useful information then it should rather share it with the investigators and contribute to the successful conclusion of the investigation,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment we have only some words, not any facts or evidence. If Australia has this evidence then should present it to the international investigators to complete the investigation.\u201d Abbott last month raised expectations of a confrontation with Putin at the forthcoming G20 meeting in Brisbane, when the prime minister said he intended to \u201cshirtfront\u201d the Russian president \u2013 invoking an Australian Rules football term for a physical confrontation. He subsequently toned down the language, but vowed to have a \u201crobust\u201d conversation with Putin about the need for full cooperation with the investigation into the MH17. \u201cI think he respects our position,\u201d Abbott told reporters after the meeting with Putin. Odoevskiy said: \u201cThe meeting itself which was set up in Beijing is an evidence of the goodwill of Russia because even after this shirtfronting [comment] and other rhetoric the Russian leader found space in his busy schedule to face-to-face meet the Australian prime minister.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said Russia needed to be open about what it knew about MH17 but he believed Abbott\u2019s shirtfront comment was a \u201cdiplomatic faux pas\u201d that undermined Australia\u2019s position in calling for full cooperation with the investigation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/nov/12/global-box-office-interstellar-big-hero-6-gone-girl", "sentences": ["No 1 openings this past weekend in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia bode well for its Asian prospects, with Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore coming next frame, in advance of a long rollout stretching into 2015.", "Donnie Yen\u2019s Kung Fu Jungle \u2013 also playing in Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and elsewhere \u2013 added another $4m (16th globally) to bring it to $14m; it seems destined to be minor Yen, unless it gets a US release, where martial arts reliably brings in the African-American crowd."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-12T14:13:39Z", "title": "Global box office: has the Christopher Nolan backlash hurt Interstellar?", "tags": ["Interstellar", "Big Hero 6", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", "Gone Girl", "The Maze Runner", "Fury", "Ouija", "Dracula Untold", "Annabelle", "Nightcrawler", "Film", "Culture", "Drama", "Animation"], "article": "The winner Hype and hubris have damaged Interstellar. If it had been the true event movie its press and marketing set it up as, it would have beaten animation Big Hero 6 to the US top spot. Instead, $46.7m makes it director Christopher Nolan\u2019s weakest opening since 2006\u2019s The Prestige. The reasons: a November release that preps the film for awards season, but remote from the big-money summer slots; the 169-minute run time; and a fortnight of intensive press coverage designed to butter up Nolan\u2019s reputation as the mainstream king of our times, but which has sown the seeds of a backlash.  Overseas box-office takings of $82.9m (\u00a352.3m) looks like an ample makeweight, containing the expected array of No 1 openings, including a beefy $14.1m in South Korea that puts it in the country\u2019s top 10 highest ever. But considering the scale of the rollout \u2013 63 territories \u2013 $83m is middling for a film that thinks it belongs in the A-league. The two films in the year\u2019s current top five that opened lower overseas \u2013 Guardians of the Galaxy ($66.4m from 32 markets) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier ($75.2m from 27 markets) \u2013 would have easily beaten Interstellar if they\u2019d set up shop in an equivalent number of territories. In terms of November openings, Interstellar is short of something like The Matrix Revolutions, whose initial overseas take was $117.6m in 2003 \u2013 though franchise branding surely played a part there.           The film-show team review Interstellar    Bluntly put, Interstellar opted to play high stakes, leveraging a massive opening at an off-peak time of year on the back of Nolan\u2019s august reputation. The danger is that the film hasn\u2019t lived up to it, and that drop-off could now be steep, with China (12 Nov) and Japan (22 Nov) the only major markets in reserve. Gravity, Interstellar\u2019s main autumn-release comparison point, opened fairly quietly abroad ($28.4m), but a gradually widening rollout saw word-of-mouth about its groundbreaking visuals build that figure week by week. In its favour, Interstellar has been tracking strongly among the over-25s who might watch the film at their leisure in the coming weeks. But it seems unlikely to kindle Gravity\u2019s repeat-business spark, which took it to $716.4m worldwide, or to match Nolan\u2019s $825.5m for Inception in 2010. $500m-ish looks like a better bet. Fun historical fact: Interstellar\u2019s mothership film 2001: A Space Odyssey managed close to that just in US domestic on its original release, if you correct for inflation ($56.9m/$389.2m adjusted).  The runner-up     Cute challenger Big Hero 6. Photograph: Disney/LFI/Photoshot    Disney can be proud of more than just keeping Interstellar in its rear-view mirror. Its new animation, Big Hero 6, is its second-best non-Pixar opening ($56.2m), behind the all-conquering Frozen, which built on a good-but-not-spectacular $67.4m start to become the most successful animated film ever. Big Hero 6, the 23rd best debut for a CGI animation, draws on the back catalogue of Marvel characters the studio now has at its disposal for its tale of prodigy Hiro Hamada, his inflatable robot sidekick, and the superhero squad they assemble. Looking at Big Hero 6\u2019s wider prospects, Frozen\u2019s $1.27bn worldwide gross is probably setting the bar too high. But if the film can connect even half as much in Japan \u2013 to whom its anime stylings are surely beckoning \u2013 then $500m-plus and a place in the yearly top 10 is eminently achievable. No 1 openings this past weekend in the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia bode well for its Asian prospects, with Cambodia, Malaysia and Singapore coming next frame, in advance of a long rollout stretching into 2015. Still not Gone            Ben Affleck talks about Gone Girl    David Fincher\u2019s Gone Girl has passed $300m globally, a testimony to undeniable staying power in the key developed-world territories most in tune with its modern-marriage autopsy, like the UK ($33.4m and counting), Australia ($20.7m), France and South Korea (where it rose by 6.5% on its second weekend). Fincher broke his own US domestic record some time ago, and is now within touching distance of a worldwide personal best, tantalisingly at hand with Japanese (12 Dec) and Italian (18 Dec) bows to come. Not bad at all, considering Gone Girl doesn\u2019t quite boast Se7en\u2019s ($327.3m) shock factor (nor an emerging Brad Pitt) and, unlike the family-friendly The Curious Case of Benjamin Button ($333.9m), is an 18 certificate. Pass those two, and Fincher will be nesting behind the far-more-expensive End of Tomorrow and Noah in the end-of-year list \u2013 perhaps the only non-youth/young adult title in the top 25. Life of Pi ($609m, 11th place) and Wolf of Wall Street ($392m, 17th place) managed a similar feat in 2012 and 2013. The rest of the world Three Chinese releases propped up the lower reaches of this week\u2019s chart. K-pop idol Rain, previously seen in the Wachowski siblings\u2019 Speed Racer and Ninja Assassin, made his Chinese film debut opposite Liu Yifei in rich-kids romance For Love or Money. That brought in $4.8m, well behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, still lodged in that country\u2019s top spot. Donnie Yen\u2019s Kung Fu Jungle \u2013 also playing in Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand and elsewhere \u2013 added another $4m (16th globally) to bring it to $14m; it seems destined to be minor Yen, unless it gets a US release, where martial arts reliably brings in the African-American crowd. Suspense thriller The Boundary Line crept in 17th globally, with $2.7m at the weekend; it follows a pair of men \u2013 one played by Vincent Zhao, who replaced Jet Li in the Once Upon a Time in China series \u2013 stumbling on a dark secret while tracking down missing loved ones. The future     Penguins of Madagascar. Photograph: 20th Century Fox    Interstellar pops out of the wormhole midweek in China, not only eager to reinforce Christopher Nolan\u2019s international push, but also \u2013 as one of the country\u2019s annual quota of 14 Imax/3D releases \u2013 top up this week\u2019s $20.9m Imax takings (a November record). But cute things could plague it there, too: Madagascar spin-off Penguins of Madagascar opens early on the 14th to avoid the December local-film deluge, and the last Madagascar did a decent $31m in China. Johnnie To\u2019s romantic comedy sequel Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart 2 \u2013 a change from the director\u2019s usual gangster fare \u2013 also enters the fray. The sole big international opening is the return of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as knuckle-dragging duo Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne in Dumb and Dumber To, unspooling in about 30 markets, including the US. It\u2019s been an unbelievable 20 years since the original: a test for the new franchise and for Carrey, who hasn\u2019t fronted a major hit since 2003\u2019s Bruce Almighty.

While there have been no announcements about whether or not he will be re-signed by the Blades, the manager, Nigel Clough, has confirmed that his reintegration into the team has been discussed at Bramall Lane, so the prospect of Evans once again being a Sheffield United player at some stage looks likely, to say the least. It is often said that where talented players are concerned, football is a moral-free zone, that no matter what someone has done, they will be backed by their clubs and indeed fans if they are performing on the pitch. It seems likely that Evans will play professionally again, begging the question: where is the moral line drawn in football? What will not be tolerated in the game, and what does it take for a club to dismiss a player for reasons other than sporting performance? Being responsible for a death The most extreme example, and a few footballers have been dismissed by their clubs after causing the death of another. The goalkeeper Luke McCormick was sacked by Plymouth Argyle after being sentenced to seven years in jail for causing death by dangerous driving in 2008. McCormick admitted causing the deaths of two children, aged eight and 10, and leaving their father in a wheelchair after driving back from a wedding while twice the legal alcohol limit. However, while McCormick\u2019s contract was terminated, it was by \u201cmutual consent\u201d according to the club, and they actually re-signed him five years later, making him their club captain in the summer. West Bromwich Albion sacked Lee Hughes after he was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving, the striker jailed for six years after losing control of his car and crashing into another vehicle, in which the passenger, Douglas Graham, was killed and his wife Maureen and the driver Albert Frisby were both seriously injured. Hughes was released three years into his sentence and was almost immediately signed by Oldham, later moving on to Notts County and Port Vale, and he currently plays for Forest Green Rovers in the Conference Premier. Assault The list of Marlon King\u2019s various transgressions is lengthy, from assorted driving offences to handling a stolen car to chasing two women through the street with a belt wrapped around his fist, but he was dismissed by Wigan Athletic in October 2009 following his conviction for sexual assault and actual bodily harm. King groped a young woman and broke her nose after she rebuffed his advances in a nightclub. \u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting and it just sets such a bad example for any youngster coming through who wants to be a professional footballer,\u201d said the Latics chairman Dave Whelan at the time. Also, Cardiff City sacked the French midfielder Kevin Sainte-Luce after he was found guilty, but not jailed, for assaulting two women. Sainte-Luce punched one woman unconscious and attacked another in a Cardiff nightclub, in what was called an \u201cunprovoked attack\u201d. Dangerous driving Two Manchester United youngsters were convicted of racing each other after leaving Carrington in 2005, although curiously only one of them was sacked by the club. Mads Timm and Callum Flanagan were found guilty of dangerous driving, sentenced to eight and 12 months respectively in a young offenders institute after causing a crash in which a young woman was seriously injured. \u201cIt is pure luck that no one was killed,\u201d said the judge at the time. \u201cThat could so easily have been the consequences of your dangerous driving.\u201d Flanagan was immediately sacked, but Timm remained at the club until he was released with a clutch of other young players just over a year later. Drugs Chelsea, it seems, have quite the zero-tolerance policy when it comes to narcotics, having shown the door to two players in recent times after they were found to have taken cocaine. Adrian Mutu failed a drugs test in 2004 and was dismissed for breach of contract, and the club relentlessly pursued the player for compensation, ending in the player being ordered to pay a little over \u20ac17m. A few years earlier Mark Bosnich was also sacked after failing a drugs test, but he denied taking cocaine, claiming a woman he was talking to in a nightclub had put it into her own drink, which he then took a sip from. \u201cI\u2019m deadly serious about this,\u201d he told the Observer in 2004. \u201cAfter all, I\u2019ve got nothing to lose now. I\u2019ve been banned, come clean about all the drugs I was doing and I probably won\u2019t play football again. Why should I lie?\u201d Match-fixing In 2013 two Conference South players were dismissed by their club Whitehawk FC after being charged in connection with match-fixing. Michael Boateng and Hakeem Adelakun were accused of conspiracy to defraud in a match-fixing scheme, involving a group of bookmakers from Singapore. The two players were sacked for \u201cbringing the club into disrepute\u201d after being charged by the Crown Prosecution Service, and at trial Boateng along with two other men were jailed, while Adelakun was acquitted. Attacking a referee While Paolo Di Canio was merely sold by Sheffield Wednesday, rather than sacked, after shoving the referee Paul Alcock to the floor in 1998, Independiente took a rather dimmer view of a similar incident in 2013. In a game against Marilia, the defender Johnny dos Santos took exception to the referee adding what he considered an inadequate amount of injury time at the end of the game, and expressed his displeasure by karate-kicking the official to the floor. Dos Santos was led from the pitch by police and dismissed by the club shortly afterwards. Attacking a supporter It is perhaps a wonder that footballers under pressure don\u2019t snap more frequently in the face of barracking from the crowd, but it has happened a few times. The most recent example came when the Goole defender Karl Colley was asked to leave the club earlier this year, after taking exception to some robust \u201cfeedback\u201d from the crowd during a Northern Premier game, running into the stands and attempting to attack the fan responsible. He was held back after making three attempts to reach his adversary, but was dismissed shortly afterwards."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/12/what-does-china-need-to-do-to-meet-its-carbon-pledge", "sentences": ["Wind turbines stand at the entrance to the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-12T18:18:15Z", "title": "What does China need to do to meet its carbon pledge?", "tags": ["Environment", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Climate change", "Renewable energy", "Nuclear power", "China", "World news", "US news", "Asia Pacific", "Energy", "Apec summit"], "article": "China\u2019s commitment to stop its emissions rising will require the kind of massive top-down reformation only possible in a one party state, according to analysts. On Wednesday, Chinese president Xi Jinping stood beside his US counterpart Barack Obama to announce an \u201chistoric\u201d deal on carbon agreed between the world\u2019s two biggest polluters.  The US announced new emissions targets for 2025 and, for the first time officially, China said it would aim to stop emissions rising by \u201caround 2030\u201d. China also committed to 20% of its energy coming from wind, solar, nuclear and other zero-emission sources by 2030. But the world\u2019s most influential country on future global warming declined to say how high the peak in emissions would be.       \u201cWe know today when we will see the summit of the mountain, but we don\u2019t know the contour,\u201d says Greenpeace East Asia\u2019s senior climate and energy campaigner, Li Shuo. The scale of change required in China makes all other countries\u2019 seem insignificant. In order to meet its clean energy target, between now and 2030 China will need to add 800-1000GW of clean energy - enough capacity to power the entire US. Tony Abbott\u2019s climate sceptic government may pause to consider that China will add enough zero-emissions capacity every year to power the whole of Australia. Analysts will now look closely at how the government backs up the international commitment in its domestic policy. The Communist party\u2019s 13th five year plan (2016-2020) will define how the country means to achieve these goals.  Milo Sjardin, head of Bloomberg New Energy Finance\u2019s Asia arm, says China\u2019s stable government allows for a level of future certainty that makes massive, systemic transitions manageable and politically relevant - a key difference with the more chaotic US system. \u201cChina is very much driven by policy and they do think very long term. Unlike the US they are not bound by 2 year electoral cycles,\u201d he says. Sjardin believes China must now look to put a price on carbon in order to shift power generation from coal to lower emitting gas. The next five year plan could also include some measures to incentivise electric vehicles in major cities. Li said that despite their scale, the goals are achievable, especially with the seal of Xi Jinping. \u201cI do have confidence that they will be able to deliver this target. Xi\u2019s signature on the statement provides some assurance.\u201d     A man walks past a coal plant amidst a dust storm in Lingwu, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Photograph: STRINGER/CHINA/REUTERS    In terms of dealing with China\u2019s deeply bureaucratic energy sector, the president\u2019s aegis is vital.  China\u2019s power supply is not dictated by markets as it is in the west, where the grid buys from the power plants that produce the cheapest energy (after subsidies). In China, state administrators dictate to operators how much power they are required to produce. Li says these decisions are governed by vested interests and heavily favour coal and gas. Xi\u2019s influence may be the key to breaking fossil fuels\u2019 grasp on the electricity sector. Many in China expect a cap on coal to be included in the next five year plan. Li says this is the single most important policy measure for reducing carbon emissions. Such a cap will not only help China to bring its emissions to a peak, it will also add impetus to the already massive push for solar and wind energy.  China has already committed to reaching a 15% share of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020. This won\u2019t be easy, says Li. The number of Chinese driving petrol cars will explode over the next 15 years, creating a significant drag on emissions reductions. The industrial sector is similarly locked into processes that require fossil fuels - for example the use of coal in steelmaking. Sjardin says the majority of gains will need to come from the Chinese power sector. At the moment around two thirds of power is generated by coal.      Coal consumption in China, in 2012. See more in our interactive guide. Photograph: Guardian/EIA    But Sjardin says a 43% non-fossil fuel share of Chinese electricity generation by 2030 is \u201cachievable\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese power sector is going to look very different after the next 15 years than it has done in the past,\u201d he says. To achieve this extraordinary turnaround, China is pouring huge sums of state money into wind and solar. In 2013, China invested US$64bn in renewable energy projects. This is $2bn less that the US invested over the same period. But from almost the same amount of money China installed more than seven times more energy capacity than America. China\u2019s money was overwhelmingly concentrated on delivering products on the ground, whereas the US was focussed on research and the development of intellectual property. In 2013, China installed 12GW of solar outstripping all expectations and smashing records. No country had ever installed more than 8GW in a single year before 2013. By 2020, China aims to have 100GW of solar installed. China\u2019s wind sector is similarly booming with thousands upon thousands of wind turbines to sprout across its high western deserts during the next six years. By 2020, wind capacity is expected to more than double from 75GW to 200GW. Wednesday\u2019s announcement will extend this trajectory. Li believes the solar and wind sectors in China are already straining and meeting the 2020 targets will be \u201cquite challenging\u201d. The cheapest, most effective gains are happening now. Each percentage of power generation added and emissions reduced gets more expensive.  But Sjardin says his modelling indicates that the 2020 and 2030 targets will be achievable, although this depends in large part on China\u2019s economic growth, which is currently slower than in the past decade. A surge in growth would drive demand for energy and send China back to the coal mine.     China\u2019s non-fossil fuel power expansion 2012-2030.   Some observers are sceptical about China\u2019s level of ambition. In the US, the Republicans have rallied around a line that the US committed to a big decrease in emissions but China has simply promised what would have happened anyway. In its World Energy Outlook, also released on Wednesday, the International Energy Agency (IEA) outlined various pathways for China\u2019s emissions.  Felix Preston, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, has analysed these and says China\u2019s new goals represent an increase in ambition but still fall well short of a safe climate future. \u201cThe 20% figure is higher than the 18% share in the IEA\u2019s latest \u2018new policies\u2019 scenario, which takes account of broad policy commitments and plans that have been announced by countries. In this sense it is another ratcheting up, and builds on the existing target of 15% in 2020. However 20% is some way below the share of 26% in the more climate-secure 450 scenario,\u201d says Preston.     Wind turbines stand at the entrance to the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin. Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images    The IEA\u2019s \u201c450 scenario\u201d, in which the levels of atmospheric carbon stay within safe limits, China\u2019s non-fossil energy would triple between today and 2030. The 20% target means it will double. Another important aspect of the equation, says Preston, is what happens within the fossil fuel mix. Natural gas, while still a fossil fuel, has significantly lower emissions that coal. Under the IEA\u2019s 450 scenario, gas use in China increases four times on current levels.  Like all Chinese policy, and the world\u2019s future climate, these decisions now rest with China\u2019s Politburo."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/15/g20-barack-obama-uses-visit-to-reassert-us-influence-in-asia-pacific", "sentences": ["Obama said America would have a bigger defence presence in south-east Asia, including Singapore, finalise new defence guidelines with Japan, deepen missile defence collaboration with the Republic of Korea, rotate more marines through bases in northern Australia and conduct more counterterrorism training with the Philippines."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-15T05:14:11Z", "title": "G20: Barack Obama uses visit to reassert US influence in Asia Pacific", "tags": ["G20 Brisbane 2014", "G20", "Barack Obama", "Climate change", "Australia news", "Australian politics", "Great Barrier Reef", "Environment", "Tony Abbott", "Asia Pacific", "China"], "article": "Barack Obama has sharply reasserted the United States\u2019 military, economic and political influence in the Asia Pacific and the importance of his so-called \u201cpivot\u201d to the region.

And we can\u2019t look at those problems through rose tinted glasses. North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programs. Disputes over territory \u2013 remote islands and rocky shoals \u2013 threaten to spiral into confrontation. The failure to uphold universal human rights denies justice to citizens and denies countries their full potential. \u201cThe question we face is which of these futures will define the Asia Pacific in the century to come. Will we move towards further integration, more justice, more peace, or do we move towards disorder, disintegration? These are our choices, Conflict or cooperation? Oppression or liberty? Here in Australia three years ago, in your parliament, I made it clear where the United States stands,\u201d the president said in the speech at the University of Queensland. \u201cAs a Pacific power, the United States has invested our blood and treasure to advance this vision. We don\u2019t just talk about it. We invest in this vision. Generations of Americans have served and died here so that the people of the Asia Pacific might live free. So no one should ever question our resolve or our commitments to our allies.\u201d The original pivot raised concerns in China, especially as it contained a new defence agreement with Australia, including the original announcement of the rotation of marines through a military base in Darwin. Immediately before this visit to Australia, Obama had a successful trip to Beijing, announcing a significant agreement on cutting greenhouse emissions with Chinese president Xi Jinping on the sidelines of an Apec meeting in Beijing. Speaking as they announced that deal, Obama said his discussions with the Chinese president had allowed him to to dismiss the idea that \u201cour pivot to Asia is about containing China\u201d. But fundamental competitive tensions between the superpowers remain. Xi used Apec to assert his own vision or \u201cAsia Pacific dream\u201d, promising aid and infrastructure spending in the region, and to push for a new Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific - a distraction from the US-backed Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks, which exclude China. Obama used his Brisbane speech to vow that the US would continue leading the efforts to realise the TPP, which he said would be a \u201chistoric achievement\u201d. China has also won the backing of 21 countries for its new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. After pressure from the US and a personal phone call from Obama to the prime minister, Tony Abbott, Australia rejected a request from China that it sign on as a founding member of the bank, citing concerns about governance and transparency \u2013 although the issue split the cabinet. The president immediately won over the Australian crowd, starting his speech with the confession that the only problem with his visits to Australia was that he had to go to conferences instead of the beach and revealing that he had tweeted about some research conducted at the university he was attending to his 31 million Twitter followers \u2013 a following he said \u201cwasn\u2019t bad, even though it was slightly fewer than Lady Gaga\u2019s\u201d."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/15/g20-obama-puts-climate-change-in-spotlight-as-australian-agenda-sidelined", "sentences": ["Before the meeting only Australia had committed money to this idea, but officials said the UK, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore and Saudi Arabia had now promised an unspecified amount."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-15T08:55:27Z", "title": "G20: Obama puts climate change in spotlight as Australian agenda sidelined", "tags": ["G20 Brisbane 2014", "Australia news", "World news", "G20", "Climate change", "Environment", "Barack Obama", "Tony Abbott", "US news", "Ban Ki-moon", "United Nations", "Australian politics"], "article": "Climate change was forced to the top of the G20 agenda on Saturday, despite the objections of the host nation Australia, after Barack Obama urged the world to rally behind a new global agreement and the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called it \u201cthe defining issue of our times\u201d. The Australian prime minister, Tony Abbott, had argued climate discussions would distract from the G20\u2019s economic policy focus and should be left to other UN-led meetings. But in a one-two manoeuvre that caught Australia off guard, Obama upstaged Abbott and made certain it was the talk of the conference anyway. First came the joint US/China post-2020 greenhouse emission reduction targets announced in Beijing on the eve of the summit and then the $3bn Green Climate Fund pledge made in a keynote speech as Abbott was greeting other world leaders across town. \u201cNo nation is immune and every nation has a responsibility to do its part,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou will recall at the beginning I said the US and Australia has a lot in common. Well one of the things we have in common is we produce a lot of carbon \u2026 which means we\u2019ve got to step up.\u201d He said the targets he announced with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, sent \u201ca powerful message to the world that all countries, whether you are a developed country, a developing country or somewhere in between, you\u2019ve got to be able to overcome old divides, look squarely at the science and reach a strong global climate agreement next year\u201d. \u201cAnd if China and the US can agree on this then the world can agree on this, we can get this done and it is necessary for us to get it done.\u201d But in the backrooms of the G20, Australia was continuing to resist language in the official communique encouraging countries to make pledges to the Green Climate Fund, prompting environmental and aid groups to warn the host nation was appearing like a \u201cblocker\u201d. Abbott has been highly critical of the fund. When asked about it before last year\u2019s UN climate meeting in Warsaw, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be making any contributions to that.\u201d It was reported that at one of its first cabinet meetings the Abbott government decided it would make no contributions to it. And Australia and Canada pointedly dissented from support for the fund in a communique from last November\u2019s Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. Abbott was also attacked for focusing on his own domestic agenda as he welcomed the world leaders to a G20 \u201cretreat\u201d on Saturday morning. Instead of focusing on world crises such as stagnating growth, the Ebola epidemic or conflicts, Abbott cited his difficulties in legislating for a new fee for when Australians go to the doctor and a plan to deregulate the higher education sector. Abbott \u201cthanked God\u201d he had stopped the \u201cillegal boats\u201d \u2013 carrying asylum seekers \u2013 and had successfully repealed the carbon tax, but complained it was proving \u201cmassively difficult\u201d to pass his budget cuts. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, described the address as \u201cweird and graceless\u201d. But in the formal negotiating sessions, world leaders were talking about the things Australia wanted on the agenda: a Brisbane action plan in which G20 nations will promise to implement new policies that have been assessed to have the potential to add 2% to their collective economic growth, and an infrastructure hub to be located in Sydney promote investment. Before the meeting only Australia had committed money to this idea, but officials said the UK, New Zealand, Korea, Singapore and Saudi Arabia had now promised an unspecified amount. Obama also used his address to reassert American military, economic and political influence in the Asia Pacific and the importance of his so-called \u201cpivot\u201d to the region. The president said the US would work \u201cday in, day out, steadily and deliberately\u201d to deepen its military, economic and diplomatic engagement \u2013 saying that by the end of the decade most of the US navy and air force would be based in the Pacific because \u201cthe United States is and always will be a Pacific power\u201d. Anticipated protests outside the meeting were largely peaceful and resulted in only a handful of arrests. Police outnumbered protesters. The world leaders were treated to an Australian barbecue lunch, cocktail reception and concert by local musicians on Saturday night. Their spouses visited a local koala sanctuary on Saturday afternoon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/nov/16/farshid-moussavi-interview-victoria-beckham-mayfair-store-rowan-moore", "sentences": ["The works shown are by stars, hacks and honest practitioners, and run from Dunedin, New Zealand to Anchorage, Alaska by way of Singapore, Riyadh and Ipswich."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-16T00:08:03Z", "title": "Farshid\u00a0Moussavi: \u2018We are in a world where ideas migrate\u2019", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "Architecture today operates in a promiscuous haze. It is so easy to see, swap, trade and imitate ideas that it\u2019s hard to see what happened first where, what is original, authentic or new. Just as styles in fashion migrate rapidly from the catwalk to Primark so it is in architecture. There are the big names, the people recognised as originators, and what might be called hack practices, who feed off their inventions; but as staff and inventions migrate between the two it can get hard to see the difference between an off-day production by the former and an above-average performance by the latter. There are also plenty who are neither big nor hack, and work in the wide open spaces between the two. It is an environment in which Farshid Moussavi is happy to operate. \u201cI am excited by being an architect now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are in a world where ideas are shared and migrate. There is no going back, so let\u2019s go beyond. Let\u2019s look at what really are the differences between, for example, two housing projects that both have curved balconies. Architecture makes a difference. Let\u2019s discuss what difference it makes.\u201d To this end Moussavi is bringing out a book called The Function of Style, the third in a series \u2013 the previous two were about ornament and form \u2013 which in an almost 19th-century way attempts to redefine the basics of architecture. They don\u2019t, however, describe their subjects in conventional ways. If you think of style as being about external appearance, as something that can be added and taken away, Moussavi does not. Rather she presents project after project, over 600 pages, in an analytical way \u2013 it should be said this is a book for professionals and students. Things like materials, location and authorship are underplayed in favour of organisational ideas, which are where, by implication, style lies. The works shown are by stars, hacks and honest practitioners, and run from Dunedin, New Zealand to Anchorage, Alaska by way of Singapore, Riyadh and Ipswich. Some of Moussavi\u2019s own works are included.     The design for Moussavi\u2019s Les Jardin de la Lironde residential complex in Montpellier, Paris. Photograph: Farshid Moussavi Architecture    Most of the works are from the past 20 years when, she says, \u201cso much production has happened \u2013 what did we learn from them?\u201d The same period is also the span of Moussavi\u2019s career. In 1995 she and her now ex-husband and ex-business partner Alejandro Zaera-Polo beat 795 other entrants to win the competition to design the \u00a3150m international port terminal in Yokohama, a spectacular breakthrough for a pair then aged around 30. If the function sounds run-of-the-mill, both the city and the architects wanted it to be anything but. The building, a long pier whose undulating wooden decks fused the transport facility with a public open space, a sort of artificial park for the citizens of the city, was one of the projects of the decade. Moussavi and Zaera-Polo called themselves Foreign Office Architects, in reference to the fact that she was Iranian-born, he Spanish, and that they were working in a London office on a project in Japan. They were the epitome of a modern globalised practice. Since they split in 2011, Farshid Moussavi has had to re-establish her practice in her own name, and now has an intriguing range of projects \u2013 a tower in the City of London, an apartment block next to the Grande Arche in La D\u00e9fense, Paris, the expansion of a famous department store also in Paris and a housing tower in Montpellier. In 2012 she completed the Museum of Contemporary Art in Cleveland, Ohio, which had started as an FOA project. In September Victoria Beckham\u2019s flagship store opened in Mayfair to Moussavi\u2019s designs.     Moussavi at the opening of the Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, Ohio in 2012. Photograph: Duane Prokop/Getty Images    The store, says Moussavi, demonstrates her belief that \u201cthe more we have the internet, the more physical space becomes powerful\u201d. She invites me to compare dating in the virtual and the real worlds: the latter \u201cis more social, unpredictable\u201d. In the case of the store, Beckham sells a lot online, so the place functions as \u201ca gallery\u201d. It is a generous series of spaces on three levels, dominated by grand staircases, diagonal geometry and mirrored ceilings, walls and counters. The products are almost incidental \u2013 a light scattering of bags greets you on a wall whose shelves are retractable, so that the space can be used for events. Later you find clothes hanging on a gold-coloured saw-tooth rack \u2013 which stops the hangers sliding irritatingly together \u2013 or on chains hanging from the ceiling. The latter, apart from their whisper of bondage, illustrate what Moussavi calls \u201caffect\u201d, a favourite word of hers. Architecture, she says, \u201cproduces platforms for the way people engage with uses of buildings\u201d, in which way it is about \u201cthe politics of everyday life. Not in a big sense, because architects are not politicians, but in the way it influences the way people interact\u201d \u2013 which interaction is with both other people and the physical environment. \u201cI am interested in architecture being a critical practice that has to do with life.\u201d The chains make you think a little about the act of putting a garment off or on its hanger, and make a small connection between you and the space as you do so. The reflections, the stairs, the hard and shiny surfaces also in different ways make you conscious of your presence in the space. So does the front door, a panel of concrete which, in the style of Rachel Whiteread, bears the negative of a sash window higher up the building\u2019s historic facade. Set within a wall of frameless glass, it is palpably heavy and a touch forbidding, but slides weightlessly away as you approach. Moussavi likes fashion: \u201cI remember all the shops in London going back to the 1970s.\u201d She says she enjoyed working with Beckham who, for the record, is \u201ca great designer\u201d. Victoria and her husband \u201care very likable people\u2026 If she sees something she likes she says so immediately. If she doesn\u2019t she stays silent. That\u2019s a great quality. Perhaps I should learn from it.\u201d At the same time Moussavi likes heavy things, infrastructure and the biggish buildings she is also designing.     Moussavi\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland, Ohio. Photograph: Dean Kaufman    On her larger projects she manipulates decisions of organisation or construction to achieve the affect which in the store is done with small things. Her housing near La D\u00e9fense is almost a straightforward, stratified block, but she skews the floors from time to time such that they angle towards the view and provide some shade to the floor below. Her Montpellier housing tower is a stack of sinuous shapes that looks superficially like the sort of stuff that spews out of architects\u2019 computers the world over, except that it is driven by the wish to place balconies so that there is the minimum of overlooking between them. Her office block in Fenchurch Street is mainly about its severe-but-sensuous wrap of dark glass, in concave vertical strips like the fluting of a column. No one project looks much like another, in keeping with her belief that, now, a repetitive artistic signature makes little sense. She likes both thinking and building \u2013 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t enjoy just having ideas\u201d. If she talks of affect and a kind of sensuality, there is also toughness in her work. It is these combinations \u2013 of intellect, construction and life \u2013 that make her approach appealing. The Beckham store begins to show what they might mean in practice. What will be more intriguing will be to see them applied at the scale of cities.

Pick up exquisite headpieces by milliner Heads of State; geometric, bold printed blouses and dresses from In Good Company; silky, printed gowns by Whole9Yards; and artisanal perfume by Code Deco. With an incongruous yet commanding locale, the pop-up has become a creative hub in the city; there are also workshops, designer Q&amp;As and exhibitions that offer a glimpse into the creative process, along with pop-up restaurants, food trucks and more. \u201cIn terms of design stores and retail, I\u2019m excited to see so much experimentation in Singapore. It\u2019s too much of a gamble for emerging designers and artists to invest in a year\u2019s rental in a [real estate] climate like Singapore\u2019s.

And for music lovers, that\u2019s nirvana. It\u2019s a really awesome place to be.\u201d Initially, the feature will be available in 10 cities: London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Nashville, New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Stockholm, Sydney and Toronto, although Kalanick stressed that the new feature will be optional for drivers. Spotify and Uber are holding launch parties on Friday 21 November in those cities, featuring artists including Andrew WK, Professor Green and Diplo. Kalanick shared the call with Spotify chief executive Daniel Ek, describing him as \u201ca fellow entrepreneur and a good friend\u201d, before Ek talked about cars as Spotify\u2019s third key device category, alongside mobile devices \u2013 smartphones and tablets \u2013 and computers. \u201cOne of the big things for us is how do we get into the car. Given that people\u2019s average commute time is 30 minutes to an hour, how do we get into that space and allow people to play their music?\u201d said Ek. \u201cInstead of just doing car integrations, we thought \u2018what\u2019s the next generation of transportation system?\u2019 Uber\u2019s an obvious fit for us.\u201d         Spotify and Uber\u2019s promotional video for their partnership.    Both Kalanick and Ek declined to discuss whether the partnership involves one or both taking a share of the other\u2019s revenues, although Ek suggested that the deal will help Spotify, which currently has 50 million active users, appeal to a younger audience. \u201cThe world is moving to having cars available on demand to you wherever you are, when you\u2019re travelling. And Spotify is having your music on demand, whatever device you\u2019re on,\u201d he said. \u201cMore and more people are skipping even owning their own cars and going straight to Uber. This is a way for us to reach a younger audience: a more millennial audience in the cities who are taking up Uber in droves.\u201d News of the partnership had leaked out over the weekend, after Uber sent invitations to journalists promising \u201ca first-of-its-kind partnership\u201d, complete with an illustration of musical notes. Technology site TechCrunch was first to pinpoint the partner as Spotify, with leaked screenshots of the integration of the latter\u2019s service in Uber\u2019s smartphone app. Spotify has been enduring a rocky few days, after Taylor Swift pulled her albums from the service and accused it of not fairly compensating artists and songwriters for streams of their work. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to contribute my life\u2019s work to an experiment that I don\u2019t feel fairly compensates the writers, producers, artists and creators of this music,\u201d she told Yahoo in an interview. Uber has faced its own controversies in recent months, including allegations of an organised effort to poach drivers from rival Lyft, demonstrations against the company by taxi drivers in several European cities, and deactivating one driver\u2019s account after he was uncomplimentary about the company on social media. Both companies will be hoping the partnership helps their growth, as well as their valuations. Spotify\u2019s last funding round in November 2013 valued the company at $4bn, although that has likely increased since. But even that pales next to Uber, with its most recent valuation of $18bn. Business Insider claimed this week that Uber\u2019s annual gross revenues are expected to reach a run-rate of $10bn by the end of 2015 \u2013 so around $833m a month by the end of the year, if not $10bn for the 12 months to that point \u2013 with the company paying 80% of that back out to drivers. \u2022 Spotify: the future of music, but how CAN musicians make it pay?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/17/banking-culture-overhaul-mark-carney-bankers-pay", "sentences": ["The Bank of England governor signalled a radical overhaul of the way bankers are paid as he told an audience in Singapore that repeated fines for scandals, such as manipulating Libor and last week\u2019s \u00a32.6bn penalties for rigging foreign exchange rates, were not enough to change behaviour."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-17T18:53:00Z", "title": "Mark Carney: dock bankers' pay for misconduct", "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "Executive pay and bonuses", "Mark Carney", "Bank of England"], "article": "Mark Carney has warned bankers they should lose more of their pay in cases of wrongdoing \u2013 in addition to forfeiting bonuses \u2013 after a series of fines for bad conduct have failed to improve standards across the scandal-hit industry. The Bank of England governor signalled a radical overhaul of the way bankers are paid as he told an audience in Singapore that repeated fines for scandals, such as manipulating Libor and last week\u2019s \u00a32.6bn penalties for rigging foreign exchange rates, were not enough to change behaviour. New measures were needed to restore the public\u2019s trust in the financial markets, Carney said, signalling that moves could include making bankers fund a bank\u2019s fines out of their pay or potentially docking salaries. \u201cThe repeated nature of these fines demonstrates that financial penalties [on banks] alone are not sufficient to address the issues raised,\u201d he said. \u201cFundamental change is needed to institutional culture, to compensation arrangements and to markets.\u201d He added that the succession of scandals \u201cmean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored.\u201d Policymakers have had bankers\u2019 pay in their sights since the 2008 crisis. They initially required bonuses to be paid in shares as well as cash and spread out over three to five years. This year the EU has stipulated that bonuses for senior bankers be capped at 100% of salary \u2013 or 200% with explicit approval from shareholders. This has prompted a rise in the use of \u201callowances\u201d, which are paid in addition to salary and bonuses to maintain bankers\u2019 pay levels. Europe\u2019s top banking regulator, however, has ruled that these arrangements breach the bonus cap. Carney said: \u201cIt is unfortunate, for example, that new European rules to cap bonuses to half, or with shareholder approval, two-thirds, of total pay have the undesirable side effect of limiting the scope for remuneration to be cut back. \u201cThis makes the case for additional reforms to ensure that the burden of excessive risk-taking and misconduct by staff can still be borne by those staff. Standards may need to be developed to put non-bonuses or fixed pay at risk. This could potentially be achieved through payment in instruments other than cash.\u201d He referred to an idea floated by the US central banker Bill Dudley to pay bankers partly in performance bonds, which he said \u201cis worthy of investigation as a potentially elegant solution\u201d. Dudley, who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said such bonds could be used to pay fines, hitting bankers\u2019 rather than shareholders\u2019 pockets. Andrew Tyrie, the MP who chairs the Treasury select committee, had warned the bonus cap could push up fixed pay - the element that Carney was now setting his sights on. Carney said the public\u2019s trust in the financial system \u201chas been severely tested by taxpayer bailouts of systemic institutions, rewards perceived as undeserved, a perception that clients have become counterparties and egregious examples of misconduct and rigging of markets\u201d. His remarks follow similar comments from his colleagues at the Bank. Last month, the deputy governor Nemat \u201cMinouche\u201d Shafik said the current fines for misconduct were \u201clike salt rubbed into the wounds to public confidence in financial markets\u201d. Her fellow deputy, Sir Jon Cunliffe, has also warned bankers to brace for pay cuts. Carney also pushed back against attempts by some bankers to argue against future reforms to the industry. \u201cAlready we can hear some of the runners, particularly those at the back, making world-weary arguments that more reform will hurt jobs and growth, and even that financial crises are just something that happens every five to seven years. If that were true, we are due for another crisis about now. Does anyone find that acceptable?\u201dCarney\u2019s remarks come as banks face scrutiny of plans to claw back bonuses following last week\u2019s fines for foreign exchange rigging. The BBC reported last night future payments to former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester were part of a review by the bank.

He goes to Abu Dhabi this week on the brink of becoming a multiple world champion and achieving a status that looked impossible for a driver who was close to meltdown just three years ago. His emotional immaturity was perhaps the natural consequence of growing up under the stern control of first his father, Anthony Hamilton, and then Ron Dennis, the autocratic boss of McLaren, who might have been born to play Malvolio. That uncertainty, that impulsiveness of nature, is still there in part. But he does have more autonomy now, both personally and professionally, and the confidence of the self-governed has been reflected in the most successful season of his career: he has won 10 races and leads his great rival Nico Rosberg (who has won five times) by 17 points as he goes into the final race. If he succeeds in winning his second championship on Sunday, by finishing first or second, even his many detractors will have to usher him into the hallowed grid of the grand prix greats. If he fails \u2013 which could happen through the larceny of the double points that will be awarded at the Yas Marina circuit \u2013 those same doubters are likely to cite this as the latest example of his inability to make the most of a God-given talent. It has long been the case that those who recognise Hamilton as one of the most naturally-gifted drivers the sport has seen have been matched by those who, for whatever reason, always view him with a certain churlishness. He has never been given the credit that was due for his breathtaking performances in his rookie season of 2007, when he finished on the podium in his first nine races, had the audacity to win in Montreal and would have carried off the championship but for some poor fortune in the final race. Hamilton was just as fast as \u2013 and sometimes faster than \u2013 his double world champion team-mate Fernando Alonso and led the championship for much of the year, the youngest driver to do so. A bewildered Alonso quit the team at the end of the season. He did win his first and only title the following year, albeit with an overtake on the final corner of the last lap. At 23 he was the youngest F1 champion in history. But while people who insist there should have been more titles since then are right, those who casually blame him for this are being a little unfair. In 2009, 2010 and 2012 Hamilton drove well and was often the class of the field, but his McLaren car was not up to the job, and nor was the Mercedes he drove last year. Only in 2011, when he imploded with problems on and off the track, was the task clearly beyond him. In 2009 he was fifth in the championship in a poor car and the season could not have got off to a worse start in Australia. He was 18th on the grid after McLaren incurred a penalty for changing his gearbox during qualifying. He managed to come third but was then disqualified for giving stewards \u201cmisleading evidence\u201d. He described it as the worst week of his life and even talked about walking away from F1. But, driving an uncompetitive car, there were still four poles and victories at the Hungaroring and Singapore. In 2010 successive wins in Turkey and Canada prompted speculation about a second title. There was also a fine wet win at Spa. But this was the year that marked the start of the dominance of Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel and he had to make do with fourth. Only the ghoulish would take pleasure from dwelling on his 2011 season. Again the car wasn\u2019t up to the challenge but on this occasion nor was the driver. He riled Red Bull when he described them as \u201cjust a drinks company\u201d. He clashed with stewards at Monaco and said he felt victimised. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m black \u2013 that\u2019s what Ali G says,\u201d he commented. Felipe Massa, with whom he had a number of run-ins, said Hamilton was \u201cincapable of using his brain\u201d, and that year he was probably right. The British driver still produced three wins, and his victories in China and Germany were of the highest quality. But his personal life was in disarray and he said that mentally he had to get back to being in \u201ca good place\u201d. It was in 2012 that we first saw the signs of a new maturity. He was, arguably, in the best form of his life and would have won a well-deserved title but for his unreliable mode of transport. Again, McLaren failed him but he had the strength and good judgment to leave the team for Mercedes at the end of the season when most people thought it was a crazy move. Mercedes were not ready for world championships last year. This year, though, they were and Hamilton has been superb, with four successive wins early in the season and then five on the spin before the last race in Brazil. Rosberg, his calculating and extremely diligent opposite, has done well to cling on to his slipstream. But Hamilton deserves the 2014 championship, especially when you consider what has happened to him since he won six years ago."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/18/mansion-tax-threat-buyers-put-off-savills", "sentences": ["Sales in Hong Kong and Singapore have also been hit by levies on expensive homes imposed to cool booming markets, but other Asian markets such as Japan and Australia are performing well and its recent US acquisition Studly has beaten expectations."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-18T13:28:37Z", "title": "Mansion tax threat is putting buyers off \u00a32m-plus homes, says Savills", "tags": ["Savills", "Mansion tax", "Politics", "Real estate", "Business", "Property", "Money"], "article": "The threat of a mansion tax after next May\u2019s general election has put off potential buyers of \u00a32m-plus homes in London, Savills has said.

The shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, has said there would be four levels of mansion tax, with the lowest band for homes worth between \u00a32m and \u00a35m. At the top end, billionaires splashing out \u00a3100m or more for a proper mansion \u2013 not just a Mayfair pad \u2013 will pay the most. The middle part of the London market \u2013 homes worth between \u00a31m and \u00a32m \u2013 remains robust, Savills said. Across the rest of the UK, sales are rising, particularly of homes worth less than \u00a32m. With the ultra-luxury property market slowing, the firm has been focusing on what boss Jeremy Helsby calls a \u201cmid-market brand,\u201d selling homes between \u00a31m and \u00a32m in areas such as East Sheen, Victoria and Battersea in south-west London. The bottom end of the capital\u2019s housing market \u2013 homes worth \u00a3500,000 or less \u2013 has been hit by tighter mortgage rules. Savills does not operate in this area but its rival Foxtons, which does, said last month that 2014 profits would fall because of a sharp slowdown in the capital\u2019s property market.

It pointed to Clarges Mayfair where it has sold 18 apartments overlooking Green Park and Buckingham Palace for a total \u00a3210m, equating to an average \u00a34,750 per sq ft \u2013 a new record for Mayfair. Savills is still confident it can meet its forecasts for this year. Sales in Hong Kong and Singapore have also been hit by levies on expensive homes imposed to cool booming markets, but other Asian markets such as Japan and Australia are performing well and its recent US acquisition Studly has beaten expectations.

They are not actual or physical installations of red balls, which is the focus of the artist\u2019s installations.\u201d Shell said it was not unusual to visualise carbon emissions spherically. For example, the New York company Carbon Visuals, which specialises in visualising greenhouse gases, has created graphics that use turquoise balls to show just how much gas is being pumped out in to the atmosphere. Despite the denials, Perschke is adamant that his creation has been appropriated without his permission. \u201cThey could have done it a lot of ways, it could have been a balloon or a kickball or a football or whatever but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s spot on and because we were in London so recently it is frustrating and disheartening. \u201cSomeone could have picked up the phone and talked to me. It is unfortunate because they have taken the visual impact of the project. If next year I\u2019m in Wales it\u2019s important to me that someone isn\u2019t thinking of Shell. I don\u2019t demonise advertising agencies but no one likes being ripped off by a mega corporation.\u201d     The RedBall in Chicago. Photograph: RedBall Project/Rex    Last year Perschke won a legal case against the French company Edenred, which also used big red balls in its advertising. \u201cIt was settled in a way that respects my copyright,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is public, the settlement is not.\u201d The artist said he had not yet decided whether he would try to take on Shell. \u201cIt is my creation. I think it is lazy. My work has a history, it has been around for years and to appropriate it maybe seems more than lazy \u2013 even a little dangerous. The larger issue is the impact on the work, I don\u2019t want the work impacted or associated in this way.

But while mobile payments startups based around the world may be sweating the entry of a trendy competitor with a bucket of venture capital cash, Square has a long way to go before it actually poses a threat to settled companies like Sweden\u2019s iZettle or American giant Paypal. Announced at an event held by the Financial Times, Square\u2019s global launch is only for its Square Register app, a business-focused product which lets small retail establishments use an Android or iOS tablet or phone as a cash register. \u201cThink of Square Register as a control centre for your business,\u201d runs the company\u2019s pitch. \u201cIt replaces your clunky old cash register with powerful software to help you run things from top to bottom. Tools like inventory management, sales reports, and tax prep help you take care of the nuts and bolts. Then there are the exclusive features you won\u2019t find elsewhere \u2014 robust analytics that help you better understand your business, digital receipts, and customer feedback. And no matter how big or small you are, it\u2019s totally free.\u201d But out of the box, the Square Register is far less capable in the company\u2019s new locations than it is in their home turf. It can control a cash register and receipt printer, and pair up with a barcode scanner to easily tot-up sales. But notably absent is the core of Square\u2019s business: card transactions. Companies that want to take card payments will have to use a whole separate solution; and while that may be a standalone card reader, in the sort of establishment considering a trendy app-based cash register, it\u2019s more likely to be a fully app-based service, such as Sweden\u2019s iZettle.  Worse still, without card transactions on the table Square isn\u2019t actually making any money from the companies who choose to use its app; even in the US, it\u2019s limited to the ultra-slim margin of just 2.75% per swipe, the majority of which goes to the card companies. The core of the problem is that most of the world has moved on from the magnetic stripe technology at the heart of Square\u2019s payment system, and it doesn\u2019t yet have a replacement to roll out which is compatible with the widespread chip and pin system. Further complicating matters is the fact that Square\u2019s first attempt to get on to consumers\u2019 devices, Square Wallet, was quietly shut down in March, and the replacement, Square Order, is only available in two US cities. An innovative attempt at rehauling the shopping process, the app lets users in NYC and San Fransisco order and pay for their morning coffees (and more) in advance of arriving in participating stores, and then uses geolocation services to warn the cafe when they\u2019re on their way to pick it up. Similarly absent is Square Cash, the company\u2019s attempt to take on PayPal at person-to-person money transfer. The most obvious example of Square splashing its half-billion dollars of funding received from investors including Richard Branson, Marissa Meyer, and the government of Singapore, is that new users of Square Cash are simply given a dollar with no strings attached. In the medium term, that money could be put to use expanding globally, too. While Square needs to get its core services into the hands of merchants sooner rather than later, its cash pile is five times the size of iZettle, and it could comfortably undercut the Swedish firm if it decided to. But time is running out as the elephant in the room stomps closer: Apple Pay, already launched in the US, will surely follow Square to the global market \u2013 and, when it does, a lot could change in short order. It\u2019s not necessarily a problem for Square or iZettle, and in some scenarios the two could even be symbiotic, letting businesses using the app-based registers take mobile payments with ease. But Square won\u2019t want to take any chances. In its existing markets, the company simply hasn\u2019t grown as fast as it needs to in order to justify the funding and valuations its attracted. It burned through $100m in 2013, according to the Wall Street Journal, and hasn\u2019t scored a solid customer base outside of its home of San Francisco \u2013 even after it upped stakes and moved to New York. Going global could change all that, or it could prove to be the swansong of a company which made its move too soon.  10 things you need to know about digital wallets "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/21/entrepreneurial-uk-10-things-britain-has-given-the-world", "sentences": ["Taiwan is in eighth place and Singapore makes it into the top 10 for the first time."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-21T13:37:19Z", "title": "Entrepreneurial UK: 10 things Britain has given the world", "tags": ["Entrepreneurs", "Technology sector", "Business", "Technology", "Internet", "UK news", "Technology startups", "Life and style"], "article": "It\u2019s official \u2013 the UK is the most entrepreneurial country in Europe, according to a new report that measures startup progress in the world.

Competition, the opportunity to start a business, and human capital are the key areas of entrepreneurial strength in the UK. Nearly 500,000 new businesses have been created in 2014 according to StartUp Britain, the online company tracker site.

ATM Scottish inventor John Adrian Shepherd-Barron, who was born in British India, came up with the genius concept of a self-service machine that would dispense money with 24/7 availability. The first machine was established in June 1967 outside an Enfield, north London, branch of Barclays bank. Plastic cards had not been invented so the cash machine was fed with cheques and paid out one \u00a310 note at a time. And we\u2019ve never looked back since.  The Cambridge Satchel Company      A Cambridge satchel. Photograph: The Guardian    In 2008 Julie Dean was looking for a timeless schoolbag for her children and so hand-made a leather satchel. Dean started the company with her mum at her side at the kitchen table with a \u00a3600 budget, sold the satchels online on eBay, won multiple awards, and has now opened a store in Covent Garden in London. Television       Scottish innovator John Logie Baird invented the world\u2019s first mechanical television. The heart of the system ran on a large spinning disk and in 1925, the public in Selfridges department store in Oxford Street, London, was treated to the sight of \u2018shadowgraphs\u2019 \u2013 silhouette outline images. By October he was able to produce recognisable images with shades of grey. Later, he developed a system of colour television and this formed the basis of the technique used by Nasa to bring live colour TV pictures from the moon. Thermos flask The thermos flask, one of the most quintessentially British items embraced by commuters and picnickers across the nation, was first invented by Scottish scientist James Dewar.

Giant screens blare out ads for electronic gadgets and energy drinks. High above street level, trains arrive every couple of minutes and deposit hordes of office workers on to Shinbashi\u2019s narrow back streets in search of grilled chicken skewers and beer, and the chance to take stock of an extraordinary week for the world\u2019s third-biggest economy. If the buzz of activity in Shinbashi \u2013 packed with offices, bars and restaurants \u2013 is any indication, this does not look like a country in recession. But the Friday evening feelgood factor is at odds with the hard data. Last Monday Japan\u2019s government caught almost everyone off guard when it announced that, after a second consecutive contraction in quarterly GDP, the economy was officially back in recession for the first time since 2012. Put simply, Japan\u2019s consumers have stopped spending. Exhibiting the same caution that consigned their economy to more than two decades of stagnation, their thrift threatens to derail prime minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s inflation-led mission to revive the economy. The news had barely sunk in when Abe announced that a rise in sales tax, from 8% to 10%, that was due to go into effect next October would be delayed until April 2017. A three-percentage-point rise in the same tax last April was widely blamed for battering consumer spending, the driving force behind 60% of the economy, and raising the spectre of deflation and recession. For now, the clamour at home and abroad for Japan to use the extra tax revenue to tackle its public debt \u2013 now worth 230% of GPD \u2013 and pay for rising health and social security costs is being drowned out by Abe\u2019s mantra of growth. On Friday evening, office workers with one eye on the clock were interrupted by their prime minister, who appeared on TV to explain his decision, just hours earlier, to dissolve parliament and call an election for next month. The 14 December poll, he said, would be a referendum on the three \u201carrows\u201d of his economic policy: monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and structural reform. \u201cThis dissolution is an Abenomics dissolution,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an election that is asking voters whether to continue with Abenomics, or to put a stop to it.\u201d Among the groups of workers manoeuvring for elbow room at a standing bar in Shinbashi, the sake fumes blended with resignation about the economy and incredulity that they would have to vote again, just two years after Abe took office. \u201cHave you any idea how much it costs to hold an election?\u201d asks Miki Takahashi, an office clerk who concedes she has been emboldened by a few glasses of sake. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously expensive, and it\u2019s taxpayers like us who have to pay for it. I want Abe to give us our money back.\u201d     Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe announces a general election for 14 December. Photograph: Xinhua /Landov /Barcroft Media    While investors and major exporters have gained from Abe\u2019s early success in boosting the stock market and weakening the yen, employees of Japan\u2019s myriad small and medium-sized firms say the benefits have yet to trickle down in the form of wage rises and job security. Among those hit hardest is the rapidly expanding underclass of temporary workers, their contracts stripped of the benefits enjoyed by their counterparts during the postwar era of breakneck growth: jobs for life, incremental pay rises and seniority-based promotions. This summer, the labour ministry said, a record high of one in six Japanese lived in relative poverty due to falling incomes in families with young children and the rise of poorly paid, irregular jobs. Izumi Oba, a 50-year-old office worker on a temporary contract, has no winter bonus to look forward to and a modest salary that barely covers her rent and bills. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job I live alone, as I can just about survive on my salary,\u201d Oba says. \u201cFriends of mine with families are having a much harder time.\u201d Abe knows that next month\u2019s election is far less of a gamble than his record-low approval ratings might suggest. The recent resignations of two ministers over alleged funding and election-law violations were unwelcome reminders of his brief, scandal-plagued stint as leader in 2006-07. But voters sceptical of his claim that there is \u201cno alternative\u201d to Abenomics say they have nowhere to turn to register their protest. The main opposition, the left-of-centre Democratic party of Japan, is still in disarray after its drubbing at the last election two years ago. Major scandals notwithstanding, Abe\u2019s Liberal Democratic party [LDP] and its junior coalition partner will emerge victorious next month, perhaps with a small dent in their two-thirds majority in the lower house. So why call an election now? It\u2019s a question voters are struggling to answer. In a recent poll just 18% of respondents approved of Abe\u2019s decision to call a snap election, while 62% opposed it. And despite Abe\u2019s \u201cback me or sack me\u201d histrionics, last week\u2019s disappointing GDP figures did not sound the death knell of his economic policy. \u201cJudging Abenomics on a quarterly basis does not make much sense,\u201d said Martin Schulz, chief economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute in Tokyo. \u201cThe data were poor because the economy is taking time to recover after the sales tax hike in April. Declaring Abenomics a failure because of the recent GDP figures would only work if you are a strong believer in monetary miracles.\u201d Many suspect that Abe\u2019s decision to go to the country has precious little to do with the (albeit delayed) inevitability of a tax increase. In the first half of next year Japan will confront two of the most divisive policy issues of recent times. Almost four years after the triple meltdown in Fukushima, Abe is lobbying hard for the restart of two nuclear reactors in the country\u2019s south-west, even though more than 50% of Japanese oppose immediate restarts. He will also attempt to push through legislation to overturn Japan\u2019s constitutional ban on collective self-defence, enabling its troops to fight overseas in the defence of allies \u2013 most likely the US \u2013 for the first time since the end of the second world war. After opinion polls showed that the public did not share his enthusiasm for changing the wording of Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, Abe has opted instead to reinterpret the meaning of its Article\u00a09, which forbids the use of force to settle international disputes. \u201cAll the talk is of tax and the economy,\u201d says Masahiro Tani, a retired IT consultant and a regular visitor to Shinbashi. \u201cNo one is saying anything about the constitution, but what could possibly be more important than peace? Next year Abe will be able to claim that we support his plans to change the constitution. By delaying the tax rise, it\u2019s like he\u2019s offered us delicious beef and then added a few other ingredients on the sly.\u201d With his party\u2019s re-election practically a formality next month, Abe will try to claim an all-encompassing mandate for his rightwing agenda, said Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. \u201cMost people consider the decision as self-serving on Abe\u2019s part,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to bribe the electorate with a delay of the tax increase in the hope that the trickledown effect will come in due course. \u201cAnd if he wins substantially, it is quite possible that he will feel comfortable and complacent and focus again on his nationalist agenda rather than the economy.\u201d At the standing bar, Tani, a striking figure in his dark-blue kimono and a trilby, puts down his drink, pauses, and recalls the time he spent working abroad. \u201cJapan has become like Singapore,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a democracy where you have a choice \u2026 of one. We get the politicians we deserve, but in a democracy we have to exercise our right to vote. I always go to the polling station, but the question is, is there anyone I really want to vote for this time? At this point all I know is that I won\u2019t be voting for the LDP.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/24/top-tips-for-social-enterprises-looking-to-expand-overseas", "sentences": ["Touch base with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI): the government body organised the trade missions which took us to Singapore and New York."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-24T16:44:25Z", "title": "Top tips for social enterprises looking to expand overseas", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Business"], "article": "A 2013 Social Enterprise UK (SEUK) survey, found that 11% of UK social enterprises are exporting their goods and services internationally.

When starting to sell chocolate in different markets, we were very conscious that people\u2019s tastes vary from country to country.

Gather a strong support network: when working outside your home market, you\u2019re exposed to new risks. Use all the support and advice at your disposal. Training staff or recruiting specialists can support the business internally, and externally it is important to ensure you have sought specific expertise, particularly with regards to compliance, which can be complicated and is vital to get right.

Have a clear understanding of who your global competitors are: the products or social enterprise focus may be different but there will always be a consumer who will look at your business and compare with another, finding similarities in ethos or even that the products are coming from the same jurisdiction. Find out who these competitors are. What is your comparative advantage? Why will your product work? How can you ensure the uniqueness of your social enterprise is projected to the consumer? Think about how you will get people to care about your social enterprise: given that social enterprises are about the story behind the product or the story behind the business, how will you ensure that your business and message will be appreciated by a global consumer? The only way to do that is through marketing. But it must be clear. Which marketing channels work in certain markets and which don\u2019t?

Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s new foreign policy chief, has expressed doubts about the effectiveness of economic and financial sanctions on Vladimir Putin\u2019s behaviour (7\u00a0November). So then what are the EU\u2019s options to counter Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine? A) Do nothing, be nice to Russia and hope that Putin comes to his senses; B) Impose limited sanctions against individuals in Putin\u2019s inner circle, and escalate them to companies and business sectors; C) Supply Ukraine with lethal and non-lethal military aid to help Kiev beat back the terrorist thugs; D) Send in Nato troops and air power. Well, we know that option A had no effect on the Russian invasion of the Crimea; meanwhile Russia continues to support the Donbass rebels even though the EU has already made concessions to Russia on implementation of its accord with Ukraine.

Nineteen Eighty-Four has been absorbed into the fabric of our society with very few of us even noticing. Working in personnel consultancy in the late 1970s, a few of us were even then resisting the use of the term human resource management but it seems in vain. Since then, the commodification of natural assets, including people, has continued apace. A further aspect is the use by the military of such terms as collateral damage to justify the accidental slaughter of innocent civilians in their inhumane quest to eliminate every potential enemy or latent threat with the use of disproportionate \u2013 and increasingly remotely controlled \u2013 weapons of personnel destruction. We are distanced from the consequences of our actions not simply by weasel language, but by robotics. Newspeak is now the accepted official language of politicians, the military and business leaders alike. Margaret Thatcher infamously claimed that there is no such thing as society. Her followers have adopted the same mentality in their unspoken attempt to ensure that her pronouncement becomes truth. The media is complicit in its language, as well as its evident desire to bring about this very outcome. What can we do to counter this progressive assault on common human values? I shall continue to heckle those who promote the devaluation of human culture and our natural inheritance, but however many of us do so, on its own this can scarcely be sufficient. It must become an essential component of our educational curriculum to question the use of demeaning and immoral language by our leaders.Noel BirdBoreen Point, Queensland, Australia \u2022 George Monbiot writes that our present age of loneliness has left us bereft of love, and that \u201cthere is no such thing as society, only heroic individualism\u201d. The word \u201cheroic\u201d is perhaps unfortunate; the term \u201cselfish individualism\u201d is perhaps a better fit, because the \u201cgreat deed\u201d of real heroes, says Joseph Campbell, is not to achieve money and fame, but to discover \u201cunity in multiplicity and then to make it known\u201d, thereby helping to amend what Monbiot calls our \u201csocial isolation\u201d.Richard OrlandoWestmount, Quebec, Canada \u2022 George Monbiot\u2019s article about the social needs of humans is well taken. However, he clearly didn\u2019t do well in biology class. Stating that we humans have a lot in common with bees when it comes to socialisation is really not a good analogy. First off, not all bees are social; some live solitary lives, such as the carpenter bee, which is perfectly happy to bore holes in people\u2019s porches and not be bothered with community activities. Moreover, honeybees, which live in hives, have a social order more like that of the Hindu caste system or the early Hawaiian kapu system: not, I think, what Monbiot had in mind for 21st\u2011century humans. Otherwise, his article was a valuable discussion of what is missing in modern life: ie, a sense of\u00a0community beyond ourselves and our families.Leonard A Cohen Northampton, Massachusetts, US \u2022 George Monbiot is the new George Orwell. Just as Orwell slated the political hacks of his time for masking the inhumane acts of his time in cloudy euphemisms, so Monbiot fearlessly calls the corporate and military hierarchies of the world to task for reducing their underlings and victims to landfill by the use of inhuman abstractions. Strange how our commanders manage to see themselves as above and separate from the \u201cbiomass\u201d. The mangling of language makes it easier to defend the indefensible. Orwell was able to distance himself from \u201cthe squalid farce of leftwing politics\u201d (his words) without ever aligning himself with the right, which has so enthusiastically, and for the most part ignorantly, taken him up as a mascot since his death. It is my hope that our George, having transcended the brutal standards of the class in which he was raised, does not fall into the double standards of the self-deluding left.Frederick R HillEschol Park, NSW, Australia Briefly \u2022 Oliver Burkeman\u2019s column (14\u00a0November) on FOMO, or Fear of Missing Out, recalls what is said to be a national characteristic of Singaporeans: kiasu, or fear of losing (out). I have had students boasting of this rather negative trait, which has made Singapore tour groups in China and the antipodes very unpopular when it takes the form of piling buffet plates high with food, much of which is left unconsumed. Perhaps the promotion of Burkeman\u2019s life-changing JOMO, or Joy of Missing Out, is the solution?Alaisdair RaynhamTruro, UK \u2022 The News in brief item on the Royal Mail recruiting for Christmas post (24\u00a0October) took me back to those days 50 years ago when it was the norm to have lads doing the rounds: trudge through snow and slush with the khaki shoulder bag, but the occasional perk, a tip and even a sherry on the doorstep. And our first-ever pay packet.E SlackL\u2019Isle Jourdain, France \u2022 The 10 million stateless people mentioned by the UN refugee agency (14 November) could be deemed citizens of the world and issued with a United Nations international passport.

It is now 6.8%, the highest of any state except Tasmania. The economy \u2013 and which major party is best-placed to manage it \u2013 permeates every other issue in this election. The government points to the state\u2019s AAA credit rating and its almost $2bn budget surplus to burnish its credentials as a good financial manager. It talks of creating 90,000 jobs since it was elected, but the truth is more complex. Many of those jobs were part-time, and job growth is failing to keep up with galloping population growth. High unemployment is not all the state government\u2019s fault, the national economy, as well as the global outlook, has at least as much influence. Manufacturing, once the mainstay of the state, is declining, and the mining boom that led to a high Australian dollar hurt the state\u2019s manufacturing sector. The car industry, for instance, is about to fold.     A worker on the assembly line at the Ford manufacturing plant in Broadmeadows, Melbourne. Car manufacturing will cease in Victoria in 2016 with the closure of the plant. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    State accounts produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Victoria\u2019s economy grew by just 1.7% in 2013-14, while New South Wales grew by 2.1% and Queensland by 2.3%. Western Australia\u2019s outstripped them all with growth of 5.5%. The Victorian economy is slowing. The talk is of an economy \u201cin transition\u201d. The question is, transition to what? That is what voters are anxious to know. Coalition The state government\u2019s \u201cjobs in the 21st century\u201d plan pins its hopes on new skills, services and big spending on infrastructure. The plan was costed at $33bn, although many details are not yet clear. The Coalition promises $100m for new skills and job programs. It says it aims to create 200,000 jobs over five years and 60,000 apprenticeships. More than $5bn would be spent to to deliver training for 850,000 people. The plan includes existing spending on big infrastructure projects including stage one and two of the East West Link, expected to cost between $16bn and $18bn, and the Melbourne Rail Link, both of which are expected to create thousands of jobs.  The government also seeks to expand Victoria\u2019s international presence with new trade offices in Singapore and Latin America, and more money to be spent on trade missions.  It believes there are opportunities for new and expanded industries in food production, pharmaceutical manufacturing, nanotechnology, international tourism and education. Labor Labor has announced a $1bn plan to create 100,000 jobs over four years, but has not specified how it will fund it. It says its first piece of legislation if it forms government will be the \u201cBack to Work Act\u201d. Specific measures include payroll tax relief for companies that hire young people and the long-term unemployed. Companies would receive a $1,000 rebate for every eligible worker employed, similar to a policy now operating in NSW. Labor also promises to establish a jobs and investment panel, an independent body of senior business and industry leaders that would directly advise the premier on how to spend a $500m fund for jobs and investment. There would be a $200m future industries fund to support new job-creating projects in high-growth sectors such as pharmaceuticals, new energy, food and fibre and international education. It has promised a $200m regional jobs fund to support projects in the country. Greens The Greens focus on a \u201cfairer, freer, more productive and environmentally sustainable Victorian economy\u201d. The party would spend money to boost the renewable energy sector, including wind energy, which it says would create jobs. The Greens would introduce a state taxation system to provide more funding for high-priority areas such as health, education, environmental protection, public transport, and responding to the threat of climate change. There are no costings for these policies at this stage.     The Codrington Wind Farm in south-west Victoria. The Greens are banking on a renewables-led economic recovery for the state. Photograph: Pacific Hydro Limited/AAP     Health  Concern about ambulance response times has plagued the government, with budget estimate papers revealing \u201ccode-one\u201d response times for emergencies worsening during the Coalition\u2019s four years in office. There have been several cases where people have died waiting for an ambulance that arrived late. It is one of the biggest health issues in the election. The Ambulance Employees Union has long pushed for Ambulance Victoria and the government to release ambulance response time data. In October, the government blocked Labor\u2019s bid to legislate for its regular release. Andrews has vowed to reintroduce the bill if elected. A bitter two-year pay and conditions dispute between the union and the government \u2013 Victorian paramedics are paid less than those interstate \u2013 has festered, with paramedics angered by changes to rostering for country paramedics and attempts to remove a subsidy paid to union delegates.  In late October, the government agreed to drop those conditions to largely match what Labor was promising. The issue was unresolved when the caretaker period began. The union has been actively campaigning against the Coalition, attending events and appearing in ads and leaflets.  Coalition The Coalition says it is spending a record $15bn in 2014-15 on health, and it has opened a new cancer centre, a new Bendigo hospital and invested in a raft of hospital upgrades. New promises include $80m for technology upgrades at hospitals and health services as part of the Victorian Innovation eHealth &amp; Communications Technology Fund, announced in the 2012 budget.     Victorian paramedics march at a rally in August. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    In a move praised by the Australian Medical Association, the Liberals have promised almost $7m to develop a real-time prescription monitoring system which would link prescription records and prevent the abuse of pharmaceutical drugs and \u201cdoctor shopping\u201d.  Tasmania is the only state with such a system but a rising number of Victorians are misusing and becoming addicted to over-the-counter medications.  The Coalition has pledged more than $150m to tackle obesity, chronic illness and diabetes as Victorians continue to get fatter. In 2003 14% of Victorians had type 2 diabetes; it\u2019s now more than 17%.  It has promised $38m for treatment and support services for ice addicts, a problem worrying regional and rural towns in particular. And the Geelong region will get $23m for the expansion of mental health services. The government has significantly expanded mental health services including funding 11 new Headspace centres. New promises include $71m for programs including for young children, those with eating disorders, suicide prevention, and for the mental health of the elderly.  Labor A $100m ambulance package will include a $60m response time rescue fund to free up ambulances and allow paramedics to divert less urgent cases to alternative care providers. Labor also promises to end the long-running pay dispute between paramedics and the government, and will sack the entire Ambulance Victoria board if elected. The opposition has promised $60m to rebuild the run-down youth mental health research institute, Orygen Youth, in Parkville. The institute\u2019s executive director is Professor Patrick McGorry, renowned psychiatrist and former Australian of the Year. It has promised a review of mental health as part of a landmark 10-year plan mental health plan. A $20m violence prevention fund would seek to make health facilities safer for staff, patients and visitors. The promise follows a call from the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation to address reports of increasing violence in hospitals, which it said was fuelled by overcrowding and drug-affected patients.     Opposition leader Daniel Andrews and his wife Cath make their way from Orygen Youth mental health centre in Melbourne after announcing they would provide $60m towards its rebuilding. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    Labor has also promised $200m to build the Western Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s hospital in Sunshine to take some of the burden off the overstretched hospital there. Greens The Greens are pushing for more funding and greater transparency for healthcare. The party wants $50m a year to increase access to primary and community healthcare in rural and regional areas and $50m for preventative health measures outside the big cities. This would all fall under the party\u2019s $400m public health action plan to provide grants for health education, screening, community health and rehabilitation.  The Greens oppose money from the National Disability Insurance Scheme being used to develop privately run housing. They want vacant and underused public land to be used for publicly supported residences. Education Along with health, education is the issue Victorians routinely nominate as most important to them. The big challenges arise from the state\u2019s \u2013 and particularly Melbourne\u2019s \u2013 rapid growth. There is a pent-up need in the surging outer suburbs for new schools and hundreds of millions of dollars in funding is needed to upgrade run-down schools. Also, as the population in the inner city and the CBD grows, there are more young children and increased lobbying from parents for new schools. The Grattan Institute has estimated that Victoria will need 550 new schools within the next two decades \u2013 a huge number that will strain state resources.  The government this year announced it would build 13 schools in growth areas under a public-private partnership scheme that would mean the government paying consortiums to build schools and maintain them for 25 years. The other major ongoing issue is vocational training. The government cut $300m from Tafe in 2012 and imposed a restructuring, decisions which particularly hit regional areas, already suffering high youth unemployment. When he became premier last year, Denis Napthine promised $200m for Tafe over four years for \u201cinnovation and structural reform\u201d. Coalition The government has promised $1.2bn for new schools and upgrades to 200 schools over four years. It has also pledged $120m for capital works for disadvantaged Catholic and low-fee independent schools, a similar policy to Labor\u2019s. It has made a series of smaller announcements, including $15m for a new specialist school in Sale (something for which locals have been lobbying for 12 years), and upgrades to a number of schools.     Teachers, students and unionists rally in support of Tafe in Victoria. Photograph: Joe Castro/AAP    Under the Coalition, all prep students would learn a second language until at least year 10, with Napthine committing $6m for languages education. A $4m school safety grants program would be used for school repairs and to fix minor safety issues. The Coalition has also promised a $100 cash rebate for the parents of all four-year-olds enrolled in kindergarten at a cost of $23m over four years. The policy was criticised by welfare groups because the payment is not means tested. Napthine also announced $2.2m to fund 3D printers for every state secondary school. Labor Labor announced a $1.3bn education package as the centrepiece of its campaign launch, promising to rebuild and upgrade public, independent and private schools and vowing to make Victoria \u201cThe Education State\u201d (even on the state\u2019s vehicle number plates). The money includes $510m to upgrade government schools, a $120m capital works program for needy Catholic and independent schools and $50m to upgrade kindergartens. It has also promised to bring in reforms to improve education for children with a disability. Measures include adding a compulsory disability component to teaching degrees, introducing an early screening program for learning disorders, and curbing the use of physical restraint and solitary confinement.  The package includes $13.5m to fund 500 breakfast clubs at disadvantaged schools. It promises a $320m Tafe \u201crescue\u201d package over four years to rebuild and reopen closed campuses. Greens The Greens promise to make Tafe a priority and restore its core funding. The party would would implement smaller class sizes, and re-establish the education maintenance allowance to fund student participation in camps, excursions and musical programs. Transport With Victoria\u2019s population projected to reach 7.7 million by 2051, how to move more people around is a major issue. Traffic congestion, lack of public transport in outer suburbs and regional areas, and overcrowding on public transport are a result of surging population and lack of infrastructure spending in the past. The debate is about more than roads v public transport. It is about the balance between those two. During the 2010 election campaign, the Coalition focused on fixing the public transport system, but in 2010 it said the $18bn East West Link to connect the western suburbs to the eastern freeway was the state\u2019s transport priority.      An computer-generated image of the East West Link. Photograph: Victorian government    A lack of transparency around the costing and business case means the project has proved controversial, especially in inner-city areas where the road will mean homes being acquired, as this video highlights. But people travelling across the city from the outer suburbs are more supportive. Labor opposes the link, but previously said it would honour contracts signed before the election. That changed in September, when Andrews announced that the opposition would dump the project if elected. The Napthine government signed the contracts for the project weeks out from the election and says Labor\u2019s shift is irresponsible. Tony Abbott has declared the election \u201ca referendum on the East West Link\u201d. Coalition The Coalition argues the East West Link is vital to tackle congestion and cut travel times for residents and businesses. It will also create thousands of jobs and boost the economy, the government says.  It estimates the road will deliver $1.40 in benefits for every $1 spent on the project, although that figure is contested. The government emphasises that it is also committed to public transport. It has announced a $3.9bn plan for 75 new trains for Melbourne, 75 new trams and 24 new rail cars for the V/Line network. Napthine says it will mean the government will buy one train a month, every month, for the next 10 years. All parties agree that Melbourne needs an expanded rail service in the city. For many years, this was the Melbourne Metro project, considered a priority by Infrastructure Australia. In May, the government \u201crealigned\u201d it, calling it Melbourne Rail Link, which would take a different route. It also promises a rail link to Melbourne airport, although it is not due to be completed until 2024. Where the billions for this project will come from is not clear.           East West Link: bring Melbourne together or tearing it apart?    The Coalition has promised to remove 40 level crossings, a $815m northern corridor transport plan to extend the South Morang line to Mernda, to duplicate Yan Yean Road, and provide extra station parking and more train services. It has announced free tram travel in the CBD, and a capping of maximum daily fares at the zone one rate, which will save some commuters from the outer suburbs more than $1,000 a year. Labor The opposition says it will scrap the East West Link if elected, in favour of its No 1 infrastructure project, the Melbourne Metro underground rail tunnel, which will provide five new stations. Again, where the billions required for this project will come from is not clear. Labor wants the Abbott government to transfer the $3bn it has pledged to the East West Link to the rail tunnel, but Canberra says it will not fund rail projects. Labor\u2019s transport policy platform, Project 10,000, includes Melbourne Metro, as well as promises to remove 50 of the worst level crossings; de-congest the West Gate Bridge; allocate a guaranteed $2bn for country and suburban roads and create 10,000 construction jobs. Labor has also promised to start work on a 24-hour public transport project it dubs Homesafe. Late-night shuttles would take people back to regional areas at all hours, while trains would run through the night on Fridays and Saturdays across all lines. Greens The Greens oppose the East West Link, wanting to re-direct the money towards public transport and other priorities. It wants to increase V/Line services to regional areas and introduce secure bicycle parking at 40 train stations in Melbourne.     A rider cycles past street art in Southbank in Melbourne. The Greens have pledged more support for cycling as an alternative to more roads spending. Photograph: Miranda Forster/AAP    Law and order At the 2010 election, the Coalition made crime a central issue, with leader Ted Baillieu claiming Victoria was being \u201ceaten from within by the cancer of sickening violence\u201d. The government has kept its promises, with reforms including abolishing suspended sentences, tightening up parole, increased sentences, and reducing judicial discretion when sentencing. It also recruited 1,900 police officers over four years. The result has been an \u201cunprecedented growth\u201d in prison numbers, according to an October discussion paper by the ombudsman. In June 2009, the state had 4,350 prisoners; by next year, it is expected to reach 7,169 inmates.  There is significant overcrowding, with the government forced to house some prisoners in shipping containers until a prison in the state\u2019s west opens in 2017. Recidivism rates have increased to almost 40%. The \u201cunintended consequence\u201d of refusing parole more often is that more prisoners are being released without any supervision or monitoring, the ombudsman said. But crime has not declined. In 2013-14, the crime rate rose by 3.7%, the third rise in three years, mainly due to increasing family violence and drug-related offences. Coalition The government consistently says it \u201cmakes no apologies\u201d for soaring prison numbers. It says its policies redressed the shortcomings of the previous Labor government, which it says was \u201csoft on crime\u201d. The most significant announcement in this area has been a $367.8m promise to recruit 500 police officers, including 250 specialists to focus on e-crime, fraud and counter-terrorism. As well, 450 police officers now used to supervise prisoners on remand and elsewhere will be freed up to return to active police duties. The government will privatise custodial duties now undertaken by police officers.     The Coalition has promised $367.8m to recruit 500 police officers. Photograph: Joe Castro/AAP    It has also promised 50 more protective service officers, that will take the total number manning train stations to 1,000. The officers will provide a \u201cstrike force\u201d for major public events. And a re-elected Coalition government would legislate to require offenders convicted of repeat killings or serious sex offences to be given an automatic indefinite jail sentence. Labor Labor has supported almost all of the government\u2019s initiatives in law and order, an indication that they have broad support in the electorate. It has not yet announced whether it will provide more police numbers. It has said it will repeal the government\u2019s \u201cmove on\u201d laws, which extended police powers to move people on who were preventing access to buildings, causing others a \u201creasonable fear of violence\u201d or who were behaving in ways \u201clikely to cause damage to property\u201d.  Legal and union groups say the laws limit political protest and free speech. They followed prolonged protests at drilling sites for the East West Link. Labor has made significant promises on human rights. It will reverse the government\u2019s amendments to the Equal Opportunity Act which wound back the previous Labor government\u2019s reforms. The aim is to restrict religious organisations, including schools, from discriminating against employers on the basis of their faith, sexual orientation, marital status, or gender identity. Discrimination on these grounds would only be allowable when there was a \u201cbona fide occupational requirement\u201d that meant an employer needed to have a particular attribute to do the job. Labor would also appoint a new commissioner for gender and sexuality to tackle discrimination faced by the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex communities. It will be based within the Victorian equal opportunity and human rights commission. Greens The Greens policy is to wind back many of the government\u2019s law and order reforms, including repealing mandatory sentences for criminal offences and reinstating suspended sentences and home detention as sentencing options. It would remove exceptions that allow religious bodies to discriminate on the basis of faith, sexual orientation and other factors. The Greens propose including homelessness and irrelevant criminal record as attributes to be protected from discrimination. Family violence For the first time in memory, family violence is a significant issue in an Australian election. It has been driven by a number of high-profile and horrific family violence-related deaths. In April, Fiona Warzywoda was allegedly stabbed to death by her partner, Craig McDermott, after attending court over a family violence order against him.  An inquest is under way into the death of 11-year-old Luke Batty, who was killed by his father, Greg Anderson, in February. The father of Savannah and Indianna Mihayo pleaded guilty to murdering his daughters in April.     Rosie Batty leaves the coroners court of Victoria in Melbourne after a hearing into her son\u2019s killing. Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP    The state\u2019s police commissioner, Ken Lay, has made the issue a focus, particularly emphasising the need for significant cultural change towards male attitudes to women. A number of family violence support services have formed a coalition to identify the 25 measures they want implemented by the next government. Coalition In October, the Liberals announced a $150m family violence package, which included $41m towards a prevention campaign in partnership with support organisation Our Watch. It will also fund a multi-disciplinary centre staffed by police, sexual assault and family violence experts and child protection staff for women and children who experience sexual assault; a trial of GPS monitoring of high-risk perpetrators; behaviour change programs for men in prison for family violence offences; and additional legal support for women. The government also announced an additional $4m to improve women\u2019s safety in mental health services if the Coalition is re-elected. It has also changed several laws, including increasing penalties for breaches of intervention orders. Overall, the government says it has doubled funding in this area since the 2010 election. Labor In May, Andrews declared family violence a \u201cnational emergency\u201d and promised Australia\u2019s first royal commission into the issue. Labor has not yet announced how much it is expected to cost, nor its terms of reference. The government says a royal commission is a waste of money and would delay action. Labor would also give the justice system the capacity to deal with more family violence cases and support women in the workplace who are experiencing violence at home. During the campaign, Andrews announced a package worth almost $23m to be used for services for women and children before the royal commission reports. It would fund practical support such as crisis accommodation and transport, children\u2019s counsellors and other special care for young people who witness violence in the home, support the work of Domestic Violence Victoria to employ additional staff, and expand family violence courts and community legal centres.  Greens The Greens would develop a $100m-a\u2013year family violence action plan. They say they would fund support services and measures to keep women and children safe, and hold violent men to account for their actions and expand prevention programs. Crisis support and housing services for women and children experiencing family violence would also be expanded, as well as measures to make the justice system safer. The Greens do not support a royal commission into family violence. Planning and development In May, the government launched Plan Melbourne, its blueprint to manage the city\u2019s growth until 2050. It was designed to increase urban density and stop the endless spread on the fringe. The idea was to concentrate development where there are already services such as public transport and shops. But the protection of Melbourne\u2019s \u201cleafy\u201d suburbs has angered those in less wealthy areas, which will bear the brunt of new apartment developments. The zones divide suburbs into streets deemed \u201cno-go\u201d, where developments of more than two levels are banned, \u201cslow-go\u201d which allow for three levels, and \u201cgo-go\u201d areas where up to four levels is allowed. It is up to councils to propose their plans for where high-density development should be banned, but critics say that councils in the city\u2019s leafiest suburbs have had greater success in convincing the planning minister, Matthew Guy, to agree.     A set of apartment blocks under construction in the inner-eastern suburb of Abbotsford in Melbourne. Photograph: David Crosling/AAP    Coalition For better or worse, the Coalition government will be known for presiding over a spree of high-rise developments in its first term in office. Since 2012, more than 39,000 completed apartments have been added to Melbourne\u2019s inner city. According to Melbourne City Council, international investors are buying up around 85% of the property on the market, 40% of the CBD\u2019s apartments measure less than 50 square metres. The planning minister, Matthew Guy, has reportedly approved all but two of the CBD high-rise applications since 2010. Guy has insisted this development is appropriate for a growing city as well as being more transparent than ever. The Coalition has said it will bring in new residential zones to \u201cprotect the natural assets\u201d of the Mornington peninsula, a similar plan for the upper reaches of the Yarra river, a crackdown on underquoting by real estate agents at auctions and will develop a new port at Hastings and push ahead with the East West Link toll road. Labor Labor has promised a review of the zoning rules with planning spokesman Brian Tee saying the policy had \u201cdistorted growth and planning by forcing intensive high-rise development in some areas, while locking up leafy Liberal suburbs\u201d. It also wants to stamp out so-called \u201cparty pads\u201d, which people rent for weekends or short stays for events such as bucks\u2019 nights. It is an increasing issue in the CBD, now home to a considerable population. Labor\u2019s planning policy would also inclusionary zoning as an affordable housing initiative for land sold by the government for development, requiring a share of construction to be affordable to first home-owners and low income families.  Greens The Greens want heritage buildings to be better protected, while renters should be given a \u201cfair go\u201d with minimum safety and energy efficiency standards. More affordable housing needs to be made available to help the 22,000 homeless people in Victoria, according to the Greens. Environment The environment, climate change, coal, clean air and water \u2013 all words and phrases you are highly unlikely to have heard from the Coalition or Labor during an election campaign where anything to do with the natural world appears to have been sidelined. This stance has been noted by environment groups who claim that while Victorians overwhelmingly support renewable energy deployment, the current government does not, to the extent that the Coalition has been labelled the worst state government for the environment since the 1960s. But the major parties have not been able to keep the environment entirely off the agenda. Clean energy advocates have railed against restrictions on windfarms, a band of Leadbeater possum lovers (and Sir David Attenborough) want a new national park in the central highlands and there are huge question marks over how long Victoria can keep burning huge amounts of highly polluting brown coal, even if it doesn\u2019t envelop any more regional towns in a toxic smog.

Photograph: Esther Beaton/Esther Beaton/Corbis    Coalition The Coalition\u2019s term in government has been highly damaging to the environment, conservationists claim. An emissions reduction target has been scrapped, a crackdown on windfarms within 2km of dwellings has helped to stall the sector and brown coal power stations continue to pump out carbon dioxide with no end in sight. The government has also been criticised for allowing ongoing, heavily subsidised logging in areas environmentalists say are home to the Leadbeater\u2019s possum, the endangered state faunal emblem. An attempt to abolish Victoria\u2019s energy efficiency target prompted more cries of protest, as did the introduction of grazing in alpine country and a plan to build a spa resort within Point Nepean national park. On the other hand, $4m has been pledged to eradicate foxes and wild dogs, nearly $13m to tackle weeds and feral pests and $11m on a plan, albeit much criticised, to save the Leadbeater\u2019s possum. Perhaps most tellingly, the Coalition didn\u2019t release an environment policy before the 2010 election and, on the brink of the 2014 election, that doesn\u2019t look like changing this time around.  Labor While environmentalists don\u2019t see Labor making huge strides on their favoured issues, the party has promised to wind back some of the contentious changes made by the Coalition. Perhaps most significantly, Labor has said it wants to get the wind industry \u201cup and running\u201d by reducing the turbine exclusion zone to 1km from the current 2km. A further $20m will be offered in grants for renewable energy projects. Labor has also promised to scrap the Point Nepean national park development, to remove grazing cattle from the Alpine national park and to retain the state\u2019s energy efficiency targets. It has also committed to ripping up contracts for the East West link, which, the road\u2019s opponents argue, will damage the environment and entrench car usage. But Labor has not yet bowed to calls for a new national park to be declared in order to protect the Leadbeater\u2019s possum, reportedly due to pressure from the CFMEU. There is also no plan to close down Victoria\u2019s brown coal plants, nor any official commitment to bring back an emissions reduction target.  Greens  Unsurprisingly, the Greens have placed greater focus on the environment than the other parties. Under a Greens plan, Victoria\u2019s most polluting power generators would be phased out from next year \u2013 starting with the Hazelwood and Anglesea plants. The Greens want to use the state Environmental Protection Act to regulate carbon emissions, with a target of net zero emissions in Victoria by 2050. Restrictions on windfarms should be eased, the Greens argue, while there should be a legislated right to connect solar panels to the grid. The Greens also want a permanent ban on coal seam gas (a moratorium ends next year) and no new coalmines. The party also wants a ban on logging in water catchments, the removal of grazing from the alpine region and the outlawing of duck shooting. Ellen Sandell, the Greens leading hope of a lower house seat in Melbourne, has said support for a new national park to save the Leadbeater\u2019s possum will be a condition of any minority government she would back.

Photograph: Anastasia Cariotis/AAP    Integrity and transparency With trust in government declining around Australia, there has been attention during the campaign on transparency and accountability issues. Before the 2010 election, the Coalition promised to establish an anti-corruption commission comparable to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption. Labor had resisted a similar body for many years, saying it was not necessary. But the establishment of Victoria\u2019s Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission, has been controversial from its inception due to criticisms that its powers were far less than the NSW model. Just before the caretaker period began, the government introduced reforms which went part of the way to addressing the shortcomings, although critics say they did not go far enough. Other issues include Victoria\u2019s political donation laws, considered the to be the weakest in the country, and ongoing controversies about the use of taxpayer money for government advertising that appear to be more about politics than informing the public. Coalition The Accountability Round Table, a non-partisan group of senior former judges, politicians and academics, several weeks ago sought policies from all major political parties on integrity issues. Its report card outlined that the Coalition intends re-introducing its reforms to Ibac if it wins the election. Its reforms including reducing the threshold that needs to be reached before Ibac can launch an investigation and allowing the watchdog to investigate \u201cmisconduct in public office\u201d, which the commission itself had requested. But it would not allow Ibac to use its coercive powers \u2013 including phone tapping \u2013 for preliminary investigations, a power available to Icac in NSW The Coalition has reformed the state\u2019s freedom of information laws, including establishing an independent FoI commission. It does not intend changing political funding or donation rules. Unlike NSW, property developers in Victoria are not banned from donating, and there is no cap on the amount that can be donated.     Denis Napthine and Daniel Andrews in parliament. Labor has pledged to to introduce parliamentary reforms, including banning \u201cDorothy Dixer\u201d questions and reducing the time limit for answers. Photograph: David Crosling/AAPImage    Labor Labor is proposing several integrity measures, including lowering the threshold that had to be reached before Ibac could launch an investigation, which goes further than the government\u2019s reforms. It also opposes changing political donation laws, but would review and possibly revise the fundraising code of conduct \u201cto ensure improved transparency of disclosure\u201d and to minimise any perceived conflict of interest. Labor promises to limit government-funded television advertising to those relating to health and safety and community wellbeing, such as road safety campaigns. It also pledges to to introduce parliamentary reforms, including banning \u201cDorothy Dixer\u201d questions and reducing the time limit for answers. Greens The Greens have extensive proposals for improving integrity, including giving Ibac powers equivalent to Icac and supporting an inquiry into the funding of political parties that would look at capping donations and introducing \u201creal time\u201d disclosures for donations more than $1,000. It would reform FoI legislation to narrow exemptions used to block information being released. Indigenous affairs The results of the 2011 census of population and housing, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2012, revealed Victoria had almost almost 40,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, up 26% since the last census in 2006. The state\u2019s Indigenous population is also young \u2013 more than one in three are under 15 years of age. Indigenous issues are largely the responsibility of the federal government, but it is also a state concern.  According to the Victorian Council of Social Service, which has released an Indigenous policy platform, key needs include integrated early childhood services for vulnerable Indigenous children, reducing family violence, and a whole-of-government plan for social change. Policy announcements and costings around Indigenous affairs have been sparse during the campaign. Coalition No formal policy platform has been announced, though funding announcements for existing projects have been made under the current budget. Labor While no costings have been provided, Labor has promised several commitments, including supporting the preservation of Indigenous art forms and languages, working with the commonwealth to ensure that the dental health of Indigenous Victorians is significantly improved, and addressing the rising number of Indigenous people in the prison system.  Labor has also promised to develop a reconciliation plan for Victoria and introduce an Aboriginal affairs report to parliament. It wants Aboriginal content to be incorporated into mainstream education. The party will aim to close the life expectancy gap within a decade and significantly reduce the mortality rate for children under five, and will aim to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in the development of health policy. Greens The Greens say they would invest $50m over four years in Indigenous affairs. This would fund capital infrastructure and capacity upgrades for Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations; strengthening the Victorian Department of Health engagement with the Aboriginal health sector by adopting an Aboriginal roundtable and community conversations model; and continuing to advocate for cooperative action between the commonwealth government and Victorian government. Animal welfare The death of two horses after the Melbourne Cup this year placed renewed focus on the racing industry and the welfare of horses, however, jumps racing continues to be the most controversial area of the racing industry. Even then, ABC\u2019s online election survey Vote Compass found only 20% of 15,000 surveyed opposed a ban on jumps racing. The opposition\u2019s racing spokesman, Martin Pakula, says Labor will leave any decision on the future of jumps races to the board of Racing Victoria. And the Coalition will make no changes to jump racing legislation. During the leaders debate between Andrews and Napthine, both said they supported duck hunting, much to the dismay of animal rights groups such as the RSPCA and Animals Australia.     Admire Rakti before the Melbourne cup. The collapse and death of the horse shortly after the race put the spotlight back on animal welfare in Victoria\u2019s racing industry. Photograph: Patrick Scala/Getty Images    But both parties have made a range of commitments to curb \u201cpuppy farming,\u201d or intensive dog breeding. Other election priorities identified by a coalition of animal welfare groups include incorporating a duty of care component into all Victorian animal welfare legislation; outlawing all intensive breeding facilities; and an urgent review of breed-specific legislation. Animal activists were angered in October when the member for Bass and former speaker, Ken Smith, called some of them \u201ca bunch of rabid dills\u201d. Coalition The Liberal party has committed $6m over four years to establish a \u201cspecial investigations unit\u201d for the RSPCA to help stamp out illegal and unethical intensive breeding in Victoria.  It has also promised to increase to RSPCA\u2019s enforcement powers to better regulate and enforce welfare standards for domestic animals, particularly those housed in breeding establishments and pet shops. Labor Labor has vowed to improve the code for puppy producers by introducing a five-litter limit, bringing back compulsory breeding vet checks, and enforcing a limit of 10 breeding dogs for each breeder. Pet shops would only be allowed to sell dogs linked to a registered animal shelter. It would provide RSPCA Victoria with an additional $5m over four years in funding to tackle puppy farms in partnership with local councils. Greens The Greens\u2019 animal welfare policy is extensive. It wants to establish an independent regulatory body for animal welfare, and end farming practices inconsistent with animals\u2019 natural behaviour. This would mean phasing out intensive farming practices. They also say they would put an end to the capturing and killing of animals for the cosmetic and fashion industries, including the use of fur, and run a community education campaign on the needs of animals and society\u2019s responsibility to them. The implementation of sustainable farming and fishing practices is also important to the party so that any impact on native animal habitat, soils, water and climate is minimal. Arts and culture Only minor and micro parties \u2013 the Greens and the Basics Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll party \u2013 have ticked all the boxes of Music Victoria\u2019s report card on each of the parties\u2019 commitment to live music. But the card says Labor\u2019s policies are much stronger than the Coalition\u2019s.     The Palais Theatre in St Kilda. Labor has promised to put $13.4m towards restoring the dilapidated live music venue. Photograph: Joe Castro/AAP    The fight to protect Melbourne\u2019s Palais Theatre became a political issue when the musician Tex Perkins announced he would stand as an independent for Albert Park. Labor later announced $13.4m towards the $26m restoration of the Palais if it wins the election. Coalition The Coalition would fund a $35m redevelopment of the Geelong Performing Arts Centre, begin work on a new Geelong Convention and Exhibition Centre and spend $400,000 over four years to fund Music Victoria\u2019s operations. It has also promised $1m for Music Victoria\u2019s regional music action. It would also provide a $500,000 live music noise attenuation assistance scheme which would mean residential developments built near existing live music venues would be responsible for noise mitigation features as part of the planning process. Labor The hallmark of Labor\u2019s arts and culture policy is $22.2m to be directed towards strengthening the local rock music industry, including establishing a rock hall of fame and re-establishing music grants. Labor has also promised to put $13.4m towards restoring the dilapidated live music venue, the Palais theatre.  It would give $100m towards redeveloping Geelong\u2019s Simonds stadium and the Geelong performing arts centre. Greens The Greens say they will support and promote local artists and local projects. They will also develop the Southbank arts precinct."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/26/accurate-figures-on-uk-wealth", "sentences": ["Ignoring the tiny tax havens and oil states that lie above UK, we are still behind Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Denmark, Sweden, Singapore, US, Canada, Netherlands, Finland, Austria, Ireland, Belgium, Iceland, Germany, France and New Zealand."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-26T19:31:54Z", "title": "Accurate figures on the UK\u2019s wealth | Letters", "tags": ["Economic growth (GDP)", "Economics", "Economic policy", "Politics", "Equality"], "article": "Many contributors bemoan UK\u2019s inability to distribute wealth fairly and provide world-class public services (Owen Jones, 24 November).

The report from the Netherlands-based peace organisation PAX lists in its \u201chall of shame\u201d banks, pension funds and other financial institutions that have contributed to production of the munitions between June 2011 and September 2014. Most of the investors are from the US (76), South Korea (22) and China (21), but there are also three from Germany and seven from the UK. One of the biggest investors is a Singapore-based company. Cluster munitions were banned in a 2008 Oslo convention that came into force in 2010 and has been signed by 115 countries. The convention followed years of campaigning against the weapon, which kills a disproportionate number of civilians, particularly children. Among countries still to sign the convention are the US, China and Russia. The US insists that the weapon is legal. Cluster bomblets dropped from the air are intended to disperse over a wide area. While many explode on contact with the ground, many others do not, remaining dangerous for years after they have fallen. Children in war zones frequently fall victim, some just by accidentally treading on them and others by playing with them, attracted by the bright colours or the prospect of setting off an explosion. Manufacture continues in those countries that are not party to the convention. One of the loopholes in the convention is that while production of cluster munitions is banned, it is not illegal to invest in companies that produce them. Loans by financial institutions to companies involved in cluster munitions almost doubled from \u00a31.4bn in PAX\u2019s 2013 report to \u00a32.8bn this year. PAX has been producing annual reports since 2009. The report calls for all 151 financial institutions in the \u201chall of shame\u201d to develop policies that exclude all financial links with companies involved in the production of cluster munitions. Suzanne Oosterwijk, co-author of the report, said: \u201cCluster munitions are banned by international law. A majority of the countries in the world have recognised that this weapon is unacceptable. And yet cluster munition producers are still able to fund their activities. \u201cFinancial institutions should introduce robust policies to ensure they are not supporting companies involved in the production of this banned weapon.\u201d Echoing this, Amy Little, campaign manager at the Cluster Munition Coalition, said: \u201cWe must put lives before profit. We\u2019re talking about a weapon that is currently killing civilians in Syria and eastern Ukraine.\u201d She criticised investments by companies in countries that have signed the convention. \u201cThe UK, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Spain and other countries that have joined the global ban on cluster munitions should legislate quickly to ensure they are not supporting the overseas production of weapons they have already outlawed,\u201d Little said. Several countries, including Ireland, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland, have prohibited public or private financial institutions from investing in cluster munitions. The campaign has been successful in persuading some companies previously in the \u201chall of shame\u201d to end their involvement in the manufacture of cluster munitions. The convention banning them came after a similar campaign led to a convention on landmines in 1997."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/nov/27/poor-transport-planning-mumbai-traffic-bedlam", "sentences": ["Despite widespread aspirations of emulating other Asian cities such as Singapore and Shanghai, a number of transport interventions are surprisingly absent.", "This includes urban road pricing or congestion charging, first pioneered by Singapore in the 1970s."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-27T07:09:28Z", "title": "Why Mumbai should get over its obsession with cars", "tags": ["Cities", "Motoring", "India", "World news", "Transport policy", "Transport", "Environment", "City transport"], "article": "London\u2019s transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy has suggested that without sustained investment over the next 30 years, the British capital \u201cwill have the kind of congestion you\u2019re looking at in Mumbai\u201d.  With its severe and growing problems with traffic jams, Mumbai certainly sets an international benchmark for what the Economist has labelled \u201ctraffic bedlam\u201d. Yet are these sorts of descriptions guilty of relegating Mumbai to a dystopian world of congestion, informality and lack of development?   Mumbai is in some respects well placed to pioneer new forms of what have been called \u2018post-car\u2019 approaches to urban transport planning. In comparison to western cities such as London, as well as cities in Brazil and South Africa, Mumbai has very low levels of car ownership. Most people walk or use public transport \u2013 an estimated 91% of trips in the city. Mumbai also would seem well placed to adopt the latest global thinking in transport planning: an influential document produced by the international consultancy firm McKinseys in 2003 had transportation as one of the six \u201ccore areas\u201d identified for Mumbai to attain \u201cworld class\u201d status.   But Mumbai seems to be off the map in terms of implementing current innovations in urban transport policy-making. Despite widespread aspirations of emulating other Asian cities such as Singapore and Shanghai, a number of transport interventions are surprisingly absent. This includes urban road pricing or congestion charging, first pioneered by Singapore in the 1970s. This absence is all the more surprising given that 500 staff are responsible for maintaining the software systems for London\u2019s congestion charge in offices located in a busy suburban neighbourhood of Mumbai ...  Mumbai also lacks public bike-share schemes despite their rapid recent spread across the globe, and unlike an estimated 166 cities internationally, does not contain any Bus Rapid Transport Systems (BRTS). Indeed, there are not even any dedicated bus lanes, despite the city\u2019s efficient bus system. Transport planning and policy in contemporary Mumbai has been geared around the motor car. More than 60 flyovers have been built since the late 1990s, despite similar schemes being deemed failures in many other cities.  There has also been an emphasis since 2008 for elevated pedestrian walkways, or \u201cskywalks\u201d. Ostensibly a pedestrian-orientated intervention, helping facilitate Mumbai\u2019s high levels of walking and tapping into a new trend for raised urban walkways such as New York\u2019s High Line, what they really seek to achieve is to clear the crowded streets below of slow-moving people, thus freeing up space for more cars.  Again the comparison with London is intriguing; England\u2019s capital is currently tearing down its highwalks, which have become at best a nostalgic feature of the post-war urban landscape.     City traffic in Mumbai. Photograph: Auscape/UIG via Getty Images    So why this emphasis on cars when the vast majority of Mumbai\u2019s population do not have access to this form of travel? One reason is that there is not necessarily the institutional capacity in Mumbai to instigate innovative approaches to transport planning. There is no comparable agency to Brazil\u2019s Institute of Research and Urban Planning in Curitiba, which for more than 40 years has helped to acquire knowledge, undertake analysis and nurture transport schemes such as BRTS.  Instead, there is a continued reliance on transport planning in Mumbai that has not been significantly updated or superseded. In particular, a 1963 report by US firm Wilbur Smith still forms the backbone for many of the city\u2019s transport schemes, such as the Bandra-Worli Sealink, which opened in 2009. This institutional \u201canalytical vacuum\u201d has been easily filled by civic-society pressure groups \u2013 small groups of \u201cconcerned\u201d middle-class citizens with interests in improving their journey to work by car. It has also been manipulated by corporate interests, who have a financial stake in steering transport planning towards large lucrative projects such as flyovers. Another important reason for the city\u2019s continued car-centric focus is the limited enthusiasm from politicians for alternative thinking around transport. There are no urban leaders \u2013 such as Jaime Lerner in Curitiba or Enrique Pe\u00f1alosa in Bogot\u00e1 \u2013 willing to act tough on cars. Instead, a large part of most politicians\u2019 time in Mumbai is spent being chauffeur-driven from the airport to the state government buildings further south, via the new Sealink. Unlike in London, Barcelona or New York, public transport and cycling is not an election winner. An image of a politician cycling like London mayor Boris Johnson, or on the Tube like his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, would be a clear sign of low status. Rather, it is instructive how a connection with highly visible, car-focused transport schemes can seemingly facilitate a political career. Nitin Gadkari, now transport minister in the BJP national administration, was the public works minister responsible for Mumbai during the late 1990s, when he became known as \u201cMr Flyover\u201d. Mumbai\u2019s love of the car is no esoteric concern. It has significant impacts on issues of air quality and on human-induced climate change, especially given Mumbai\u2019s influential role across urban India. But this is not to say that sustainable transport solutions from elsewhere are necessarily the panacea for Mumbai\u2019s transport difficulties. Not only is there no guarantee they will transfer to Mumbai successfully, but they may not be the most appropriate to the city\u2019s specific needs and existing infrastructure.  In truth, Mumbai contains many of its own key pointers for urban transport futures. Not only in terms of its impressive statistics for non-motorised modes of commuting, but in its management of large numbers of people via public transport. This is a city where one suburban station might deal with the population of Copenhagen on a daily basis.  So perhaps it is not surprising that features of Mumbai seem to be appearing in London. The implementation of shared spaces or \u201cnaked streets\u201d, such as Exhibition Road in Kensington, resemble ordinary, suburban streets in Mumbai, where different road users jostle for position but somehow manage to negotiate their routes. Maybe Sir Peter Hendy might also be pleased that London is moving in the direction of Mumbai.  Professor Andrew Harris is a geography and urban studies lecturer at University College London.

Coe\u2019s name has been linked with a number of roles and he was courted by David Cameron to become chairman of the BBC. The Olympic 1500m gold medallist in 1980 and 1984 has made it clear he sees his future in sports administration and said during the London Olympics that his likely next move would be to try to become president of the IAAF. He took on a short-lived position as Cameron\u2019s legacy tsar and concentrated on his roles as chairman of sports marketing agency CSM, board member at Nike and charitable roles with his own foundation and the London 2012 project International Inspiration. Diack, the sometimes controversial Senegalese, has been president since 1999 but has pledged to make his current four-year term his last. Coe is expected to face competition from his fellow IAAF vice-president Sergey Bubka, who has long nurtured ambitions for the top job in athletics. \u201cFor as long as I can remember, I have woken knowing that athletics, in some way, would shape my day,\u201d Coe said. \u201cAs a young boy, running was the thing that I loved beyond anything else and I have been hugely fortunate that athletics has been at the centre of my life ever since. \u201cAs I speak to friends and colleagues around our great sport I appreciate that we are entering a very important time for athletics and that it is the right time to open up a discussion about the future.\u201d Among the challenges that Coe will have to address in his campaign is that of balancing the growth of the sport in developing markets with the desire to ensure athletics reaches new generations of fans in the United States and Europe. Last year Diack strongly hinted he would anoint Coe as his chosen successor and the endorsement of the 80-year-old would be a boost to Coe\u2019s chances. The IAAF membership will vote on their new president at their congress before the world championships in Beijing in August. In 2017 the world championships will come to London\u2019s Olympic Stadium. Coe fought a rearguard action to save the athletics track in the stadium and led the London bid to host the world championships in 2011. As the face of London\u2019s bid to host the 2012 Games, his speech in Singapore in 2005 was widely credited with helping to tip the balance in the capital\u2019s favour. If he did succeed Diack as president of the IAAF, the former Conservative MP would also automatically receive membership of the International Olympic Committee.

In this case, they needed to be carefully glued back into position among the 700,000 Lego bricks making up the full-size sleigh, nine reindeer, sack of presents and the man in red, which have landed in Covent Garden in London. \u201cWe\u2019ve packed a few spare antlers too, just in case,\u201d Duncan Titmarsh said. The sleigh and its crew were designed and built by a team led by Titmarsh, who has one of those jobs career guidance teachers never mention: he is one of just 13 accredited full-time Lego professional builders in the world. He had to break off work on the sleigh over the weekend to install a Lego Christmas tree in Poland \u2013 a comparatively easy task, since unlike the world record 12.2m (40ft) one he built in St Pancras station in 2011 the Polish one, and those already in place in Hungary and the Czech Republic, stand a mere 8m tall. Like all their most complicated pieces, the sleigh began life as a drawing converted through a computer program into a 3D diagram which roughly shows how to shape it in tiny plastic bricks. Human ingenuity is still needed to create the modelling, particularly of curving pieces like the raised hooves of the reindeer. After horrible early experiences of trying to lift half-tonne pieces by hand, they now build on to steel pallets which can be moved with a fork-lift truck.     Lego reindeer. Photograph: Jeff Moore for the Guardian    Titmarsh got his first Lego set at the age of four, and was instantly hooked, an obsession that lasted until he discovered girls in his teens. He was married and working as a kitchen fitter when, on an outing with his wife, Sharon, he spotted a set he hadn\u2019t seen before in a shop window. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you buy it?\u201d she said nobly \u2013 and life changed for ever. Can he remember which set rekindled the obsession? He looks bemused at the foolish question: it was the Technic Helicopter No 8825. He joined a local adult Lego modellers\u2019 club and was soon being asked to make special pieces for birthdays and presentations until more Lego than kitchen work was coming in. He took the giant decision \u2013 backed by his magnificent wife \u2013 to turn professional. Fortunately he didn\u2019t need a loan, so didn\u2019t have to explain the project to a bank manager. \u201cI had just about enough stock in the shed to get me started,\u201d he explained, \u201ca few million bricks or so\u201d. He now keeps around 7m in stock, stacked up to the ceiling in the awesomely tidy workshop, buying them in \u2013 he gets a discount rate, but does have to buy the bricks \u2013 500,000 at a time.     People are allowed to climb into the sleigh and sit next to Santa. Photograph: Jeff Moore/Guardian    He now employs 15 full-time staff, and as many again in the final build stage of major projects like the sleigh. Almost all, along with his business partner, Ed Diment \u2013 who gave up his job as a management consultant in the City to join the company \u2013 came from the same modelling club. He and Diment are well-matched: Titmarsh likes building long, straight stretches using the classic 8x2 peg bricks, Diment likes twiddly bits. Initially the business occupied a small workshop on an industrial estate in Hampshire, but soon had to move to a much larger one. Now that it holds items including a 500,000-piece mosaic portrait of a wealthy family which soon has to be shipped to Italy, a gigantic model of the Queen Mary which Diment is working on personally, and a sabre-toothed tiger which has come back in from a museum for a few running repairs, they\u2019re considering taking on a second warehouse. Being approved by Lego involved submitting examples of his work and being interviewed to make quite sure he was made of the right stuff. The Danish company originally made wholesome wooden toys, and the name is a shortened Danish phrase meaning \u201cplay well\u201d. He knows the other 12 builders, including the New York-based Nathan Sawaya, whose exhibition of Lego sculptures is currently in London as part of a world tour. They all meet regularly at conferences: the most recent was in Singapore, the one before that in the US. It is, he agrees, quite a long way from life as a kitchen fitter. The sleigh is the first piece they\u2019ve built that people are officially welcome to climb on to; you can sit in the sleigh beside the great man to have your picture taken \u2013 hence the spare parts kit they\u2019re sending with it. After a great deal of discussion in the workshop, Rudolph\u2019s nose is red \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t exactly glow. \u201cWe did talk about putting a bulb into it,\u201d Titmarsh said, \u201cbut inevitably it was going to go at some point, and I was going to get a phone call at midnight on Christmas Eve to drive to London and fix it. So no, red but no glow.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/27/international-premier-tennis-league", "sentences": ["All are excellent players, mainly in doubles, and they are the makeweights sprinkled among the 21 major champions and former stars in the four franchises, from Manila, where Andy Murray is based, to Singapore, to New Delhi and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-27T20:44:48Z", "title": "Will International Premier Tennis League be a game changer or a flop? | Kevin Mitchell", "tags": ["Tennis", "Eugenie Bouchard", "Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Sport"], "article": "Tennis is at an intriguing point in its development. The left-field experiments being tried at the end of another draining season will either augment the established, imperfect model that has nonetheless served the game well enough for decades or collapse in acrimony. The first of the new models will be showcased across Asia this weekend. Gathered in four cities thousands of miles apart from Friday until 13 December are players of genuine star quality, whose involvement will be brief and lucrative, as well as some not so well-known outside the game and a few old favourites. If the inaugural International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) does not disintegrate in a financial quagmire, it has a chance of surviving, and players generally will be pleased with that. If you are prepared to play in front of a few puzzled locals for $10,000 in, say, Cambodia, multiplying that purse by a factor of a hundred or more for some inconsequential matches in front of much bigger television audiences against the game\u2019s elite is an attractive alternative. Bruno Soares, for instance, is a lucky guy. So too, is Daniel Nestor. Treat Huey celebrates Christmas early, as well, as do Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna, Malek Jaziri and Nenad Zimonjic. All are excellent players, mainly in doubles, and they are the makeweights sprinkled among the 21 major champions and former stars in the four franchises, from Manila, where Andy Murray is based, to Singapore, to New Delhi and Dubai. Missing will be Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, whose franchise applications folded. Murray caused a stir on his arrival in Manila this week when he met the nation\u2019s sporting hero Manny Pacquiao, who retained his WBO welterweight title at the weekend and remains on course for a lucrative showdown with Floyd Mayweather in 2015. He will be courtside for boxing fan Murray, who will do his best to be ringside if Pacquiao ever does fight Mayweather. The knock on the IPTL is that it is a contrived competition with no established fan-base, no history, an uncertain future and no compelling reason to exist as a sporting event \u2013 although that might be said of many competitions that have gone on to become accepted. What the IPTL does have is the potential to make a few people a good deal richer in a short time. The total prize money has been quoted as $29.7m, although the breakdown will not be equal. Murray will return to London early next week at least $1m to the good after a few days of what can politely be called glorified exhibition tennis. So, too, will Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. Rafael Nadal, whose representative Benito Perez-Barbadillo is a prime mover, will miss the tournament while recovering from appendicitis. Eugenie Bouchard, the sparkling young Canadian, will not be among them, pulling out injured on Wednesday with a training injury \u2013 and that is another concern. The tournament is eating into players\u2019 rehab schedules in a sport that makes heavy physical demands. The tournament has a few quirky rule changes: a player receiving serve can double his or her score by nominating one power point per set; there will be no advantage points in a race to six games for a point and the match; the team with most points wins the tie in a round-robin format. It is a lot of change to take in but it might work. Will they all go back next year? If it is still going \u2013 and there has to be doubt about that. The organisers think they have a winning product. \u201cModelled after successful sports franchise concepts,\u201d says the blurb, \u201cthe IPTL combines world-class sports and entertainment in a format that keeps spectators and TV viewers completely engrossed.\u201d As tennis grows into its new skin, compromise is likely, in the way that cricket accommodated short forms to refresh interest while hanging on to the traditional four-day and five-day versions, although there has been a downside there from which tennis could learn. Test cricket outside the Ashes series is struggling, one-day and Twenty20 are still strong, especially in India where the IPL, the template for tennis, is the richest tournament in the game. There are more experiments to come: in the WTA, with a similar format, and in Sydney in the New Year, when Federer and Lleyton Hewitt will launch a pared-down form of the game, again with no ad scoring and no lets, tie-breaks at 3-all and the winner first to four games. Tennis Australia\u2019s chief executive, Craig Tiley, a fan of IPTL, incidentally, calls it a \u201cgame-changer, set to revolutionise the game of tennis\u201d.

The survey shows the average (mean) salary of a sample of employed workers who carry out these occupations. The data is taken from their PAYE record \u2013 it includes bonuses, but the figures do not cover the self-employed or celebrities who don\u2019t appear on company payrolls.

Head of a company or organisation Includes: CEOs and presidents leading organisations of more than 500 people Average pay before tax: \u00a3107,703 Pay range: \u00a325,953 (10th percentile) to \u00a3136,779 (80th percentile). Median is \u00a375,237. Annual change: -8.4% Best part of the job: Telling everyone else what to do, obviously. Or, as Michael Bruce, the CEO of online estate agent Purplebricks.com, puts it: \u201cInspiring people to realise their potential.\u201d Worst part of the job: \u201cToo many meetings,\u201d says John Styring, the CEO of Igloo Books. \u201cUnnecessary admin,\u201d says Neil Everatt, the CEO of the business software company Software Europe. \u201cMaking tough decisions,\u201d says Bruce. How to get there: \u201cTypical requirements are an MBA, 30 years of experience and/or advantageous family connections,\u201d says Sam Cropper, the CEO of Climatecars, an eco-friendly taxi company. \u201cBut all I had, when I became CEO at the age of 29, was a drive for progression and a positive outlook on life.\u201d Everatt agrees: \u201cQualifications are not important \u2013 it\u2019s all about experience and attitude.\u201d 2.

How to get there: Learn to fly a commercial aircraft. That means being accepted on to a training course. \u201cThe basic entry criteria for our programme is a minimum of five GCSEs, and fluency in English,\u201d says Karen Bath, spokeswoman for pilot training school CTC Aviation. Training to be a pilot is, however, very expensive \u2013 the British Airline Pilots Association says it can cost \u00a3100,000 and starting salaries can be less than \u00a323,000. 3.

Worst part of the job: Balancing what everyone in the company wants. \u201cJuggling multiple stakeholders who all have strong and different opinions on what marketing should or shouldn\u2019t be doing is the worst task,\u201d says Dan Roche, marketing director for IT and telecoms firm Olive Communications. How to get there: Most marketing directors have degrees, but these don\u2019t have to be in marketing or business. Many start off as graduate trainees at a large company and learn on the job. 4. Information technology directors Includes: Telecommunications directors and CIOs Average pay before tax: \u00a380,215 Pay range: \u00a324,266 (10th percentile) to \u00a383,023 (75th percentile).

Worst part of the job: Dealing with colleagues who don\u2019t understand IT. \u201cIT leaders get beaten up when things don\u2019t work but often can\u2019t secure budget that would prevent the incidents from occurring. For many IT leaders, it feels like a losing battle,\u201d says Ferguson. How to get there: \u201cThe larger roles will typically require a combination of experience and a relevant degree,\u201d says Jos Creese, president of BCS, the Chartered Institute of IT. \u201cOften an MBA is helpful.\u201d 5. Financial institution directors Includes: Heads of banks and building societies Average pay before tax: \u00a378,782 Pay range: \u00a324,255 (10th percentile) to \u00a3102,749 (80th percentile). Median is \u00a350,032. Annual change: +7.2% Best part of the job: Having the power to change the world \u2013 albeit by lending money to people. \u201cI love to see the positive impact the huge variety of organisations we work with are having on people and the world around them,\u201d says Charles Middleton, the MD of Triodos Bank, which only lends to and invests in organisations that benefit people and the environment. Worst part of the job: \u201cDealing with any situation where people are taking advantage of the bank or using the bank for their own purposes: fraud, for example,\u201d says Middleton. How to get there: \u201cHave a background in banking or the financial sector, especially at the moment, with so many regulatory aspects to contend with,\u201d he says. 6. Public relations directors Includes: Advertising directors and heads of press offices Average pay before tax: \u00a377,619 Pay range: Unknown (no reliable data was collected by the ONS). Annual change: +23.8% Best part of the job: Having your finger on the pulse and, in some roles, travel. \u201cMuch of my day-to-day work involves having a global perspective on up-and-coming trends and new brand launches; this means I often travel to fun places like Brazil, Singapore and New York,\u201d says Sarah White, PR director at Halpern, a London-based PR agency. Worst part of the job: \u201cBeing the last to be told,\u201d says Andy Ross, spokesman for the Chartered Institute of Public Relations. \u201cWhen you are the guardian of an organisation\u2019s reputation, being advised of a developing situation at a late stage can be frustrating.\u201d What you need to get there: A degree that encourages clear communication and analytical thinking, such as English or Law, is favoured over people with degrees in PR, communications and marketing, says Jamie McLaughlin, MD of PR recruitment firm Capstone Hill. But what\u2019s most important, says White, is a passion for design, writing or branding. 7. Financial managers and directors Includes: Chief financial officers (CFOs) Average pay before tax: \u00a376,320 Pay range: \u00a316,963 (10th percentile) to \u00a397,211 (80th percentile). Annual change: -0.9% Best part of the job: Getting involved with everything. \u201cYou get a great overview of the business and that means you can really have an impact and help the business to do something constructive, that makes a tangible difference,\u201d says Stephen Ibbotson, spokesperson for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Worst part of the job: \u201cPeople hate budgeting. It\u2019s a pretty thankless task. Everyone thinks you\u2019re a pain in the backside,\u201d says Ibbotson. How to get there: A lot of managers have a degree but Ibbotson says you don\u2019t need to have one. You will, however, need to pass professional accountancy exams. 8. Air traffic controllers     Fewer than 1% of applicants are accepted. Photograph: National Air Traffic Control Services    Average pay before tax: \u00a375,416 Pay range: \u00a354,449 (25th percentile) to \u00a384,209 (60th percentile). Median is \u00a378,602. Annual change: +9.3% Best part of the job: Sending planes into the air. \u201cWorking in departures is my favourite task,\u201d says Ady Dolan, a National Air Traffic Control Services (Nats) air traffic controller at Heathrow. The work is fast-paced and meaningful: \u201cIn an hour-long session, you can clear 45 to 55 aircraft for take-off, and ensure that thousands of people are safely en route to their destinations.\u201d Worst part of the job: \u201cPoor weather, such as fog, snow, or strong winds can make our lives very difficult,\u201d says Dolan. Even when the weather improves, he says, \u201cthe recovery stage can pose quite a challenge as the floodgates open!\u201d How to get there: Academically, you need to be over 18 and have at least five GCSEs. You then need to pass a series of competency tests and interviews \u2013 fewer than 1% of applicants to the Nats training course are accepted each year. 9. Rail engineers Includes: Aircraft engineers, ship and hovercraft officers, and other transport professionals Average pay before tax: \u00a374,402 Pay range: \u00a340,490 (20th percentile) to \u00a398,507 (75th percentile). Median is \u00a372,663. Annual change: +7.5% Best part of the job: \u201cThe chance to indulge in childhood dreams,\u201d says John Jeffers, principal engineer for railway infrastructure firm BCS Design. \u201cAs rail engineers we get access to interesting and historical structures and infrastructure that the general public would never normally have the chance to visit.\u201d Worst part of the job: \u201cThere can be a lot of repetitive tasks associated with infrastructure projects, such as signalling renewals and route works,\u201d says Jeffers. How to get there: A typical rail engineer has a BSc or MSc in engineering, which is a prerequisite to gaining the critical chartered engineer (CEng) status. \u201cBeing accredited as a chartered engineer enables you to progress to higher level rail engineer roles with greater responsibilities. The status is mandatory for many of the key roles on a design and delivery project team,\u201d adds Jeffers. 10. Company lawyers Includes: Patent attorneys Average pay before tax: \u00a373,425 Pay range: unknown (no reliable data was collected by the ONS). Annual change: +7.5% Best part of the job: The diversity of the work, according to the Law Society. \u201cYou gain a commercial understanding and get involved in significant matters at a much earlier stage of your career as a lawyer,\u201d it said. Worst part of the job: \u201cPicking up other people\u2019s dropped balls and sorting out other departments\u2019 problems, and rarely getting praised for saving the day,\u201d says Georgina Stanley, editor of Legal Week. \u201cYou need humility and a thick skin to succeed as an in-house lawyer.\u201d How to get there: An undergraduate degree, post-graduate law qualifications and \u201can ability to appear to be a master of everything that might incur legal costs\u201d, says Stanley. The pay range stated is the broadest available as reliable data was not consistently collected by the ONS for the 10th and 90th percentiles. \u2022 This article was amended on 28 November 2014.

In an attempt to restore his shattered credibility on immigration, the prime minister will say on Friday that Britain\u2019s EU membership is now dependent on nation states being able to withhold almost all benefits from EU migrants. The proposal, which would affect more than 300,000 EU migrants working in Britain and claiming tax credits, is designed to reduce the disparities between the take-home pay earned by EU migrants in Britain and that earned in their home country, and is aimed squarely at the low-skilled end of the labour market. The plan to make Britain a less attractive place is an implicit acknowledgement that cutting back on EU migrants\u2019 access to out-of-work benefits \u2013 the main thrust of coalition policy so far \u2013 is ineffective, since migrants come to work rather than live on benefits. The proposal, which would require a rewriting of the EU\u2019s social security rules, and possibly treaties, is to be delivered in an address in the West Midlands and will set out Cameron\u2019s terms for recommending Britain continue its 41-year-old membership of the EU in a referendum scheduled for 2017.  Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, welcomed Cameron\u2019s proposals, saying the prime minister was \u201cpretty much on the right lines\u201d. But, speaking in Singapore where he is on a trade tour, Johnson said it would be a bad idea to send out the message that Britain was \u201chostile to talent and hostile to brilliant people who want to come and make their lives in our country\u201d. Sir Gerald Howarth, the Conservative former defence minister, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that Cameron\u2019s plans were welcome, but they relied on an EU renegotiation and people wanted action now. In an article for the Guardian\u2019s Comment is free, Pat McFadden, the shadow Europe minister, accused Cameron of pandering to Conservative Eurosceptics, whome he described as \u201cTory Trotskyists\u201d. Such pandering was a mistake because they would never be satisfied until Britain left the EU, McFadden argued.  Insisting his proposals are not outlandish and deserve to be heard, Cameron will promise: \u201cI will negotiate a cut to EU migration and make welfare reform an absolute requirement in renegotiation.\u201d Significantly, Cameron has held back from calling for an emergency brake to give nation states power to block EU migrants if there is an unexpectedly large surge of migrant numbers. His proposals are therefore predicated on a cut in potential income for EU migrants being sufficient to slow the numbers of poorer EU migrants coming to the UK. But the prime minister will make it clear he is willing to leave the EU if his points are not addressed, though that is not his purpose. He will say: \u201cWe have real concerns. Our concerns are not outlandish or unreasonable. We deserve to be heard, and we must be heard. Here is an issue which matters to the British people, and to our future in the European Union. The British people will not understand \u2013 frankly I will not understand \u2013 if a sensible way through cannot be found, which will help settle this country\u2019s place in the EU once and for all.\u201d He will add: \u201cIf I succeed, I will, as I have said, campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. If our concerns fall on deaf ears and we cannot put our relationship with the EU on a better footing, then of course I rule nothing out. But I am confident that, with goodwill and understanding, we can and will succeed.\u201d Seeking to reflect the growth of popular support for Ukip, he will say: \u201cPeople have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control. \u201cPeople want government to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come, both from around the world and from within the European Union \u2026 And yet in recent years, it has become clear that successive governments have lacked control. People want grip. I get that \u2026 They don\u2019t want limitless immigration and they don\u2019t want no immigration. They want controlled immigration. And they are right\u201d. The Conservatives claim Cameron\u2019s package will deliver the toughest system on welfare for EU migrants anywhere in Europe. The key reforms will mean that in future EU workers will: \u2022 Not get in-work benefits until they have been in the UK for four years. \u2022 Not get social housing until they have been in the UK for four years. \u2022 Not get child benefits and tax credits for children living elsewhere in Europe no matter how long they have paid taxes in the UK. EU jobseekers will not be supported by UK taxpayers, and will be removed if they are not in a job within six months. The proposals include measures previously announced, including abolishing the system in which EU migrants can bring family members from outside the EU without any restrictions. There will be tougher and longer re-entry bans for rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters, and stronger arrangements for deporting EU criminals and stopping them coming back. There will also be no access to the labour market for nationals of new member states joining the EU until their economies have converged more closely with current members. The prime minister will say that these changes should apply to the whole of the EU, but should that not prove possible, he would negotiate them in a UK-only settlement. In his speech, Cameron will insist he is not seeking to challenge a central premise of the EU \u2013 the free movement of workers within the EU. He will say: \u201cBritain supports the principle of freedom of movement of workers. Accepting the principle of free movement of workers is a key to being part of the single market. So we do not want to destroy that principle or turn it on its head. But freedom of movement has never been an unqualified right, and we now need to allow it to operate on a more sustainable basis in the light of the experience of recent years. \u201cMy objective is simple: to make our immigration system fairer and reduce the current exceptionally high level of migration from within the EU into the UK. \u201cWe intend to cut migration from within Europe by dealing with abuse; restricting the ability of migrants to stay here without a job; and reducing the incentives for lower paid, lower skilled workers to come here in the first place. \u201cWe want to create the toughest system in the EU for dealing with abuse of free movement. We want EU jobseekers to have a job offer before they come here and to stop UK taxpayers having to support them if they don\u2019t \u2026 EU jobseekers who don\u2019t pay in will no longer get anything out. And those who do come will no longer be able to stay if they can\u2019t find work.\u201d Senior figures including the new EU president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, have said the principle of the free movement of workers is non-negotiable, but are likely to support a fundamental review of the rights of EU migrants to be able to access other countries\u2019 social security systems. British diplomats and ministers have been touring European capitals trying to rally support for the proposals, and it has been notable that Cameron, in a belated effort to build alliances, has in recent weeks been loth to criticise his long-term opponent Juncker. The prime minister\u2019s speech comes as immigration figures show net migration to Britain is now 16,000 a year higher than when the Tories came to power. Net migration rose to 260,000 in the year to June \u2013 an increase of 78,000 on the previous year, making a mockery of Cameron\u2019s critical 2010 election \u201cno ifs, no buts\u201d pledge to bring net migration down below 100,000 before the 2015 election. The level of net migration to Britain has been above 200,000 every year for a decade now and is an indication of rising labour mobility within Europe. Cameron\u2019s coalition partner, Nick Clegg, said: \u201cThis was a Conservative preoccupation. They made that promise. They have now broken that promise and they will have to suffer the embarrassment of having done so. I think that it does damage public confidence in the immigration system by over-promising and under-delivering in this way.\u201d The numbers show that putting aside the EU net migration figures, net migration from outside the EU to Britain has risen to 168,000. The government in theory has control over migration from outside the EU, but the figures suggest it has not been able to put bold enough measures in place to counter the lure of the UK\u2019s buoyant economy. Cameron is likely in his speech almost to make a virtue of the failure of his policy to argue that extraordinary counter measures are now required to give a clear right for EU nation states to decide whether and when EU migrants should be allowed to be paid in-work tax credits. In advance of the Cameron speech both the Liberal Democrats and Labour have called for the right of EU migrants to claim tax credits to be curtailed. A snapshot of the tax credit caseload in March 2014 found 318,000 families had a non-UK EU national in receipt of tax credits, alongside a further 421,000 non-EU nationals. About 16% of the total tax credit caseload comes from outside the UK. The figures also show EU migrants are slightly more likely to claim in-work benefits than UK nationals. EU migrants make up 5.56% of the UK workforce, but families with at least one EU migrant make up 7.7% of in-work tax credit claims. It is argued that withdrawal of tax credits, principally working tax credit and child tax credit, will dramatically cut the amount of income unskilled EU migrants receive, leaving them closer to the salary they would be paid in their native country. The thinktank Open Europe has calculated that if tax credits were withdrawn a single earner on the minimum wage with no dependent children would see their income drop by \u00a3100 a week from \u00a3290.28 to \u00a3196, taking their pay close to the Spanish minimum wage. The disincentive effect of withdrawing tax credits for an EU worker on the minimum wage in the UK but capable of earning the average wage in their home country would force Polish workers to take a 22% pay cut, while a Bulgarian would only earn a little more. Open Europe has argued that in-work benefits should not be available until an EU migrant has worked in Britain and contributed to social security for between two to five years. It is argued continental welfare systems, unlike the UK are still dependent on the contributory principle."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/28/europol-arrests-stolen-credit-cards-flights", "sentences": ["Interpol in Singapore and Ameripol in Bogota took charge of operations in non-European destinations."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-28T12:10:07Z", "title": "Europol arrests 118 people using stolen credit cards to pay for flights", "tags": ["Cybercrime", "Technology", "Data and computer security", "Internet"], "article": "Police have arrested 118 people at 84 airports around the world as part of a global investigation into plane tickets paid for with stolen or fake credit card details. Troels Oerting, director of Europol\u2019s European Cyber Crime Centre (EC3), told the Guardian that many of those arrested were linked to other forms of crime, including robbery, shoplifting, illegal immigration and drug smuggling. The operation, co-ordinated by EC3, brought together 49 law enforcement agencies from around the world, numerous banks, 64 airlines and the International Air Transport Association to share intelligence on fraudulent transactions. Interpol in Singapore and Ameripol in Bogota took charge of operations in non-European destinations.

Oertling could not say the total value of the fraud, but told the Guardian that the highest profile cases had been targeted in this operation.  Criminals can easily get their hands on stolen credit card data from a range of different markets online. The likes of rescator.cc and kaddafi.hk, octavian.su and cheapdumps.org are filled with stolen credit card details every day, most of which will have been stolen by hackers. Rescator was home to much of the data stolen from US retail giant Target this time last year, as noted by the security reporter Brian Krebs.  On Friday Rescator was still showing details of a single credit card from the UK selling for just $19. Cards from various big name banks, including HSBC, RBS and Nationwide, are all for sale on the site. Mark James, security specialist at ESET, said criminals are extremely organised and will find and use stolen card details very quickly.  \u201cThieves will often test the card by making small under the radar purchases or even small donations to charities to see if the transaction goes through,\u201d he said. \u201cIf successful they will often make as many purchases as possible until the card is maxed or stopped.\u201d \u2022 Want to avoid government malware?

But it only took seconds for Maria Sharapova to give the game away. On court Sharapova is usually ice-hearted and merciless: a tennis equivalent of Elsa from Frozen, who tries to conceal, not feel. But having rallied from 2-5 down to beat the world No67, Kristina Mladenovic, 6-5 after a five-minute shootout, she started joyously pumping her hands to the uncomplicated Euro-disco beat, before laughing and high-fiving her Manila Mavericks team-mates. The ITPL organiser claims \u201cthe revolutionary new league promises to change the manner in which the world enjoys the top sport\u201d. Sharapova\u2019s reaction told you otherwise: this was fast-food tennis, fun but utterly disposable. It probably mattered less to her than any match she played on the Tour this year. Even so, as the Russian cheered on her team-mate Carlos Moy\u00e1 against Fabrice Santoro in a legends\u2019 match, the television commentators stressed its relevance. \u201cMany people have suggested that this is just a glorified exhibition but these guys get here in a crowd and an arena like this and it does matter,\u201d said one. \u201cYes, these guys have got so much pride,\u201d added the other. \u201cThey have been grand slam champions and world No1s \u2013 they don\u2019t want to be embarrassed out here.\u201d Watching Santoro, his belly now expanded to half-Depardieu, going through his full range of Gallic shrugs suggested that embarrassment came a distant second to the piles of cash on offer. Those riches have tempted the cream of the current crop \u2013 including Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Andy Murray \u2013 as well as past greats such as Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. Organisers claim they want to \u201cchange the face and future of the game\u201d. Little wonder, then, this four-team, fortnight jaunt through Manila, Singapore, New Delhi and Dubai is compared to cricket\u2019s Indian Premier League. It is nothing of the sort, even if it has swallowed much of the template: franchises, loud music, scantily-clad cheerleaders dancing during timeouts \u2013 something that seems appallingly backward and mid-20th century. The format (one set of men\u2019s singles, women\u2019s singles, men\u2019s doubles, mixed doubles and legends\u2019 singles) is also skewed towards men: Sharapova was the only woman who played for the Mavericks, who had five men in action. It feels like a wasted opportunity given tennis is one of the few sports where women match men in ratings.     Maria Sharapova celebrates with her Manila Mavericks team-mates after defeating Kristina Mladenovic on day one of the IPTL. Photograph: Dennis M Sabangan/EPA    The scoring changes, designed to make the game fresher, feel like unnecessary tampering with a classic recipe: the equivalent of adding Brazil nuts to an apple crumble to make it stand out. At deuce, there is no advantage, simply next point wins. At 5-5 there is a five-minute shootout to decide the set. Once during a set, players can opt for a happiness powerpoint \u2013 which as any middle manager could you tell you, sounds like a contradiction in terms \u2013 where the next point counts double. They add nothing. Only one change truly works: a maximum 20 seconds between points, the last five seconds of which are sounded out by a ticking clock. You wonder how the injured Rafael Nadal would manage without the time to towel down and adjust his pants. By Sunday\u2019s third day, early-onset old-fartism was in full swing. Then again, perhaps we should not be so quick to judge. New concepts usually meet resistance. Exactly 36 years ago on 1 December, in the formative days of World Series Cricket, the Guardian dismissed Kerry Packer\u2019s rebranding of the game as \u201cexcruciating\u201d, adding that \u201cit possesses an undeserved breathlessness which the non-stop talking commentators \u2013 Trueman, Lawry, Benaud and company \u2013 will surely find it hard to maintain in the glum days\u201d. Similar thoughts were expressed at the embryonic stages of the IPL. But there is a big difference between the IPL and its wannabe equivalent. With Test cricket taking five days, there was a clear gap in the market for a speedier, more TV-friendly version of the sport. Most tennis matches take a couple of hours. They don\u2019t need tweaking. Another difference: the IPL, for all its froth, matters to players: bowling and batting figures are filtered into their career averages, while match-winning performances can increase their auction value and thus their salary. The IPTL is just about money. Which isn\u2019t a terrible thing per se: tennis is a short career after all. But given Sharapova made $24.4m (\u00a315.6m)between June 2013 and June 2014 while Murray made $19.2m over the same period, money surely matters less than the need for recuperation after a long season. But no: it is a case of forget the grind, think about the greenbacks. It is telling that the ATP Tour\u2019s executive chairman, Chris Kermode, does not see the IPTL as a threat, telling the BBC that while it is \u201cgreat\u201d that tennis is being taken into virgin territories \u201cI think we just have to be very clear it is a series of exhibitions\u201d. Watching disco music ricochet around an arena that was by no means full, watching the final set of a match that, because of the scoring system, was already decided, I thought to myself: if this is the future, can I retreat to the present?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/01/new-era-estate-hoxton-westbrook-protest-labour-shameful", "sentences": ["Blakeway and Johnson are currently on a trade mission to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia seeking to boost foreign investment in London."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-01T06:00:04Z", "title": "Pressure rises on Westbrook Partners to scrap New Era estate evictions plan", "tags": ["London", "Labour", "Politics", "Housing", "Communities", "Society", "UK news", "Housing market", "Business", "Russell Brand"], "article": "Labour has called on US investment company Westbrook Partners to scrap its plans to evict 93 families from the New Era Estate in east London and instead sell the homes to a social landlord who can keep the community together. Speaking in advance of a major protest by residents and their supporters at the firm\u2019s offices in Mayfair on Monday afternoon, Sadiq Khan, the shadow justice secretary and shadow minister for London, told the Guardian: \u201cThe shameful New Era saga embodies everything that is wrong with London\u2019s broken housing market.\u201d Westbrook Partners bought the Hoxton estate in March and transferred its ownership to an offshore company in the Channel Islands tax haven of Jersey. The firm is understood to be planning to evict the tenants, refurbish the estate and re-let the flats at full market value \u2013 which in some cases could be three times higher than current rents. Westbrook has only made assurances that rents will not go up before the turn of the year. \u201cOrdinary Londoners are suffering, with their homes ripped from underneath them and their lives and families pulled apart, just so international investors can make a quick buck, with no regard to the community they are destroying,\u201d said Khan. \u201cIf Westbrook won\u2019t provide affordable housing to families on the estate they should sell to a social landlord who can keep the community together.\u201d Hackney council believes Westbrook does not want a long-term commitment to the estate which has led to speculation it may sell within a few years once its value has increased by ratcheting up rents. On Sunday night, the new owners wrote to all residents stating \u201cthere will be no changes to the tenancy agreements and no increase in rents during the first half of 2015\u201d. The letter, which was hand delivered, said: \u201cto help us work with you more closely we will also be appointing a dedicated tenant liaison officer \u2026 We understand the accusations about us and our plans have caused concern and distress amongst tenants, so we hope that these commitments provide some further reassurance.\u201d  Lindsay Garrett, chair of the New Era residents association, said the letter only deferred the eviction plans. \u201cWestbrook are hoping this will die down and we are going to go away but we won\u2019t because we haven\u2019t got anywhere else to go,\u201d she said. Hundreds of people are expected to attend the protest in Berkeley Square which is being organised by residents and their families. Russell Brand, the comedian and campaigner who has thrown his weight behind the residents\u2019 campaign, is expected to speak alongside resident leaders including Garrett. Residents and their backers will then march from Westbrook\u2019s offices to Downing Street where they will hand in a 292,000 signature petition to the prime minister\u2019s office which calls for the owners to keep rents at an affordable level so existing tenants can afford to stay. Support for the campaign to defend New Era estate has been widening in recent days and backers include the children\u2019s author Michael Rosen, and the comedian Mark Thomas. The protest comes amid continuing negotiations between senior London politicians and Westbrook\u2019s managing principal, Mark Donnor. Over the last ten days, the firm has held meetings with Richard Blakeway, the deputy mayor for housing, Meg Hillier, the tenants\u2019 Labour MP, Jules Pipe, the elected mayor of Hackney, and Philip Glanville, the cabinet member for housing at Hackney. Hackney is proposing that Westbrook sells the homes to a social-housing organisation, but in the absence of clear powers to force the private company to act, the negotiations are understood to be delicate. Pressure is now growing on the London mayor Boris Johnson. Last week, Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York, where Westbrook is based, spoke out against the firm. \u201cLondon is experiencing what New York City used to experience,\u201d he said in an interview with Russell Brand on his Trews show. \u201cOur city government found a huge number of violations of our law by Westbrook for unfair treatment of tenants and attempts to interfere with tenants who organised for their own rights. I can\u2019t tell you that what you are experiencing is news to us ... Sometimes it is fair to say there is a limit to the amount of profit you should make, because you shouldn\u2019t want to dislocate people from their lives.\u201d In April, Eric Schneiderman, the state attorney general, ordered Westbrook and other private equity owners of series of housing complexes to payback $1m in rent to 1,700 tenants and make urgent repairs. It followed residents\u2019 complaints about conditions at the blocks and allegations that the owners\u2019 management company, Colonial Management, blocked tenants and housing activists from organising and used intimidation tactics to break up peaceful meetings. There is no suggestion of similar problems at the New Era estate which Westbrook bought in March. In a statement issued last week Westbrook said: \u201cWe take our responsibility as a landlord very seriously and are committed to working closely with our tenants throughout this period ... We are committed to engaging in constructive dialogue with tenants, their representatives and interested local parties.\u201d It said it will not change any tenancy agreements or rent levels until 2015 and that this will only be done after meetings with residents which it wants to conduct on an individual basis. Khan, who is thought likely to bid for the Labour candidacy for London mayor, said the situation showed \u201cwe need more affordability and stability in rented accommodation and a national register of landlords so councils can run licensing schemes which would stop this sort of abuse\u201d. Blakeway and Johnson are currently on a trade mission to Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia seeking to boost foreign investment in London.

It raised more than $100m for the US\u2019s ALS Association and \u00a37m for the UK\u2019s Motor Neurone Disease Association.  The viral campaign in which people shared videos of themselves wet, shivering and hopping around gardens all in the name of charity was a phenomenon that melted away after a few months. It is now a fundraiser\u2019s golden memory.  Giving Tuesday, a campaign aimed at becoming a social media blockbuster, arrives in the UK on Tuesday and I believe it has longevity. It is a global social media campaign that has designated 2 December as the day we celebrate and encourage giving in all its forms; some employees are even donating blood cells to the Delete Blood Cancer campaign. Giving Tuesday started in the US in 2012 as an antidote to the Christmas shopping season. It follows Black Friday \u2013 the discount shopping day that has suddenly become part of our Christmas tradition. Giving Tuesday has quickly taken hold across the world with Canada, Singapore, Mexico and Israel now all taking part.  Last year, on Giving Tuesday in the US, compared to 2012 online donations to charity increased by 90% to $21m. In Britain, the campaign is already off to a flying start. Famous faces like Helen Mirren have spoken about it and 550 UK companies and charities have signed up as partners to celebrate the day by donating time or money, or by helping spread the word. So, why will Giving Tuesday last longer than the ice bucket challenge or Nomakeupselfie? For me, there are some fundamental differences between the campaigns that show Giving Tuesday has staying power. Open ideas Social media is like a badly behaved child: it is fickle, it gets bored easily, it constantly needs feeding and it does not stay in one place for long. This means that if you rely on one type of content, such as the ice bucket challenge, like that small child the campaign will tire quickly.  To maintain momentum a social media campaign needs lots of fresh content. While ice bucket challenge and no makeup selfie were prescriptive, Giving Tuesday is open to ideas \u2013 allowing participants to take the cause into their own hands. Already a host of charities are coming up with creative ideas. RNIB is running a #passtheparcel tweeting campaign. By retweeting RNIB\u2019s hourly #passtheparcel tweet, you not only encourage others to donate \u00a33 via text message you will be entered into the prize draw for that hour. Kids, the disabled childrens charity, is running a Twitter campaign called #Donateajoke as part of its \u00a3130,000 fundraising drive.  Good timing Research shows that the timing of a campaign can make all the difference and increase donations. For instance, the public are much more likely to donate to charity in December than in January.  In the US last year, the United Methodist Church was one of the most successful fundraising efforts for #GivingTuesday. It raised $6.5m and provided a $500,000 matching pot for online donations. By promoting that idea throughout the day \u2013 mostly by email \u2013 it encouraged nearly 11,000 donors in 34 countries to make more than 16,300 gifts on its website. Behavioural insight Giving Tuesday is a campaign that goes with the grain of human behaviour, which is a key device in encouraging charitable giving. This campaign, for me, serves a deep psychological need, fitting into our December spending habits.  As the campaign focuses on one day of the year, I have high hopes of it becoming part of the annual calendar and Christmas tradition. Giving Tuesday is a social media campaign that had the potential to truly change our giving behaviour. Instead of creating a sensational spike every so often, it will bring charitable giving into the social norm.

Entering the country is only possible through pre-approved tours, but many of these have been cancelled because of the Ebola ban, which according to a notice on Koryo Tours website is still in place. Tourism in North Korea is subject to much debate. As the country continues to widens its doors, some have reservations about visiting a totalitarian regime accused of committing accused of mass human rights atrocities against its own people, but others say that any interaction for its citizens, no matter how stage managed, has to be a good thing.

Son of Kate (nee Newey) and John, Terry was born on the Barbican \u2013 the old harbour area \u2013 in Plymouth. As a boy, Terry played the piano in the window of his grandmother\u2019s furniture shop, to attract customers. Nancy, Lady Astor, when mayoress of Plymouth, used to visit the shop, and invited Terry\u2019s family to call in at Cliveden for afternoon tea when they made their annual visit to the Ascot races. At 14 Terry joined the Royal Marines as a band boy in Deal, Kent, becoming an accomplished flute, piccolo, clarinet and saxophone player. During the second world war, he served with distinction on HMS Arethusa, Belfast, and the Durban, aboard which he was engaged in the perilous evacuation of Singapore under heavy fire from the invading Japanese. While he was away, his family home in Plymouth was flattened by the Germans in one of the numerous bombing raids on the city. In 2013 Terry received belated recognition for his part in \u201cthe worst journey in the world\u201d, with the award of the Arctic Star for service on the Arctic Convoys. He met Sheila McCartney, a physiotherapist, while playing golf near her workplace at the Dame Hannah Rogers school, in Ivybridge, Devon. Following their marriage in 1954, Terry joined the Royal Horse Guards Band, in which he played the flute and piccolo. He made regular appearances at Windsor Castle, the Guards Chapel, and Royal Ascot, where Princess Margaret once invited him into her box to discuss horse racing. Along with his band duties Terry, a sublimely quick sight-reader, was in demand playing in the orchestra for West End shows in London in the 60s, and also taught woodwind at Eton. Although he retired from the army in 1973, he continued teaching until 1991. Among his famous pupils was Princess Caroline of Monaco while she was a pupil at St Mary\u2019s school, Ascot, but he happily gave free lessons to those who could not pay and provided instruments. Music apart, Terry was a useful all-round sportsman, playing chiefly cricket, football and, most importantly and until his late 80s, golf. Sheila died in 2012, after which the onset of dementia meant Terry needed full-time care. A kind, generous, family man and terrific raconteur, he always had a willing audience for his tales of life on the seven seas, playing in the band, and boyhood antics in Plymouth. He never complained, and was always ready to greet everyone with a smile. Terry is survived by my brother, David, and me, and by his grandchildren, Alice, William, and Anna."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/03/st-louis-resilient-cities-china-london-paris-sydney", "sentences": ["The second tranche of cities was named at a one-day conference in Singapore, where delegates also discussed the major threats facing cities over the coming decades: natural disasters, social unrest, economic inequality, access to healthcare, management of water and freedom of movement.", "Photograph: Victor Paul Borg/Alamy    Eight Asian and Middle-Eastern cities - Phnom Penh, Deyang, Bangalore, Amman, Huangshi, Chennai, Singapore and Toyama - were chosen, along with four African cities: Arusha, Accra, Kigali and Enugu.", "Asia: Toyama (Japan); Chennai, Bangalore (both India); Deyang, Huangshi (both China); Singapore; Phnom Penh (Cambodia); Amman (Jordan)."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-03T04:00:04Z", "title": "St Louis aims to ease social tensions as it joins 100 Resilient Cities programme", "tags": ["Cities", "Singapore", "Urbanisation", "Missouri"], "article": "Strife-torn St Louis is among 35 cities around the world inducted on Wednesday into a $100m programme designed to strengthen their resilience to natural disaster, and enhance their ability to tackle issues such as violence, social exclusion and transport congestion.

According to St Louis officials, upgrading infrastructure and improving public health and education will help ease social tensions there.   A total of 35 metropolitan areas have been added to the 100 Resilient Cities programme, an initiative funded by the Rockefeller Foundation which allocates financial and logistical support to each chosen city, including a dedicated \u201cchief resilience officer\u201d.

Photograph: Victor Paul Borg/Alamy    Eight Asian and Middle-Eastern cities - Phnom Penh, Deyang, Bangalore, Amman, Huangshi, Chennai, Singapore and Toyama - were chosen, along with four African cities: Arusha, Accra, Kigali and Enugu. Other successful applicants include London, Barcelona, Paris, Boston and Wellington.  Athens was chosen after a period in which the Rockefeller Foundation noted that unemployment has averaged over 50% for young people. More than a third of Athens\u2019 buildings are vulnerable to earthquakes, and the city is also baking in increasing heatwaves. But the foundation said the city is making \u201csignificant efforts\u201d to expand welfare and healthcare services. Also in Europe, Paris \u2013 while a \u201cglobal icon\u201d \u2013 has experienced community segregation due to urban gentrification, and its public transport system is under growing pressure, the foundation said. Lisbon is also dealing with creaking infrastructure, with city officials reporting that they are looking to do more to mitigate the impact of climate change. Chicago is making a shift towards a technology-driven economy and is making strides to prepare itself for blizzards and floods, the foundation said. Phnom Penh suffers from regular energy blackouts and deteriorating air quality due to soaring car ownership. Meanwhile residents of Sydney, one of the world\u2019s more liveable cities, are paying soaring electricity bills due to obsolete infrastructure and are at increasing risk from climate change-driven heat waves. Climate change, which the World Bank has warned poses a \u201cserious threat to urban infrastructure, quality of life and entire urban systems\u201d, is a particular point of focus for the project. It is estimated that extreme weather events, which are increasingly fuelled by climate change, have already cost the world economy $2.5 trillion this century, with much of the damage caused in cities.

But the ongoing, visceral outrage of protestors throughout the United States at the shooting of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown has thrown cities\u2019 needs for social, as well as physical, betterment into sharp relief. St Louis has been wracked by protests following the decision not to indict Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown in August. The local NFL team has provoked the ire of the Missouri police union for taking part in the \u201chands up\u201d protest gesture that has been adopted throughout the country. On Wednesday, the Rockefeller Foundation unveiled a further 35 cities that will take part in its 100 Resilient Cities programme \u2013 among them, St Louis. Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said the city\u2019s application was an \u201carticulate and honest\u201d appraisal of the racial and economic divides present in the city.     Rockefeller Foundation president Judith Rodin. Photograph: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP    \u201cThe city leaders of St Louis talked about how to re-knit the social fabric,\u201d Rodin said, adding the issue was a common theme among the more than 330 applicant cities from 94 countries. \u201cMany applications mentioned immediate concern of civil unrest, it\u2019s something that\u2019s increasing. We are seeing larger discussion of it this year than last. City officials are recognising this will be a big piece of the 21st-century challenge for them \u2013 it\u2019s not physical infrastructure, it\u2019s social infrastructure. \u201cWe have seen social unrest in the streets throughout the US\u2019s history. Los Angeles over a number of years had similar forms of unrest and they are building themselves back, but it\u2019s a long haul. The data shows that no matter what the shock is, it\u2019s hard for a city to recover \u2013 it brings them down to a lower baseline going forward.\u201d Michael Berkowitz, president of the 100 Resilient Cities programme, said that race and inequality \u201cfeels like one of the big challenges for resilience thinking over the next few years. We\u2019re seeing it across many different cities: is it going to be a fruit vendor setting himself on fire, or is it the police shooting someone in suspect circumstances? If you don\u2019t have that kind of social cohesion, anything can set things off.\u201d The Rockefeller Foundation has committed $100m to the resilient cities initiative. Collaborative work on alleviating social ills between some of the first tranche of cities chosen, in 2013, is already underway, with Medellin, the Colombian city previously considered the murder capital of the world, advising New Orleans on crime prevention. Medellin has worked to provide a better way for poor residents of the barrios, in the hills surrounding the city centre, to access the valley where most economic activity occurs. New Orleans, in turn, is working with Rotterdam on water management, while earthquake-prone cities San Francisco and Christchurch are plotting a better way to deal with seismic activity. Social unrest can hinder all such progress, however; experts at Wednesday\u2019s announcement warned that three \u201ccolliding trends\u201d \u2013 urbanisation, globalisation and climate change \u2013 will increase stresses on cities and risk leaving many people feeling excluded.     Outdoor escalators in Medellin, Colombia. Photograph: Action Press/Rex Features    The goal of the 100 Resilient Cities programme is to have a series of systematic measures in place to deal with various forms of disadvantage, so that cities can, as Rodin puts it, \u201cbend not break\u201d when disaster strikes and bounce back afterwards. That will require a change in approach from many of those in government, business and the general public, according to Donald Kanak, chairman of Prudential Corporation Asia, who also spoke at the resilient cities\u2019 unveiling in Singapore. \u201cIf people came in here right now and threatened us, we\u2019d all act,\u201d Kanak said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s in the future, that\u2019s different. People are told they should save for their retirement, but all the data shows it\u2019s something they want to do but don\u2019t. \u201cWe also live in a \u2018distant present\u2019. People are hungry in different parts of the world, but somewhere else from you. Resilience is a double whammy \u2013 it\u2019s considered not now and not here. We haven\u2019t put together the institutional architecture to deal with this.\u201d Nevertheless, Rodin insists that cities are beginning to confront these challenges. Around 70% of the cities putting forward applications come from the developing world, with municipalities keen to deal with issues such as migration, climate change and water \u2013 whether that\u2019s too much or too little of it. \u201cIt may be the case that in the 21st century, crisis is the new normal,\u201d Rodin said. \u201cGlobally it seems that a week doesn\u2019t go by where a city doesn\u2019t experience some kind of disturbance to the normal flow of things \u2013 a cyber attack, a new strain of virus, or a structural failure.  \u201cBut there is optimism. The cities that do best will be those that plan and prepare, not just respond. Not every disruption has to become a disaster.\u201d     A homeless man on the streets of Athens. Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP    Some cities, of course, have more problems than others. Giorgos Kaminis, mayor of Athens, pointedly mentioned London, which has cited \u2018cybercrime\u2019 as a major worry, when discussing his own city\u2019s ills. \u201cI heard London talk about cyber attacks,\u201d Kaminis said. \u201cBut in our case, resilience is about everything \u2013 social, economic, natural disasters. We have 60% youth unemployment, 40 buildings were set on fire during riots in 2012, and now because of the Syrian war there is an immediate threat of more than a million people seeking shelter in countries in southern Europe. Unfortunately, we are not prepared to receive so many people in our country. \u201cIt used to be unusual to be homeless in Athens, but since the outbreak of the crisis, we now have many, many homeless people from the middle class. We have to take care of them somehow. That is resilience to me.\u201d  Watch a video of the 100 Resilient Cities announcement "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2014/dec/05/find-and-eat-delicious-street-food-around-the-world-without-getting-sick", "sentences": ["From Delhi to Singapore many of my most memorable meals have been eaten kerbside.", "In Singapore it\u2019s worth heading to the Joo Chiat district, while in Hong Kong the street food stalls, known as dai pai dongs, can be found in alleyways \u2013 and busy streets \u2013 all around the territory.", "In Singapore Tony Tan\u2019s walking food tour gave me an intriguing introduction to Singapore\u2019s history and politics as well as food while in Delhi a local food writer and blogger, Pamela Timms at Eat and Dust, directed me to her regular rickshaw driver who took me down all sorts of laneways to discover places I would never have found alone."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-05T00:26:45Z", "title": "Find and eat delicious street food around the world without getting sick", "tags": ["Travel", "Asia"], "article": "From Delhi to Singapore many of my most memorable meals have been eaten kerbside. When you\u2019re travelling the best food is generally not found in the overpriced restaurants filled with tourists or (surprise!) at your hotel buffet, but instead on the street.While every second restaurant in Australia now offers a \u201cstreet-food menu\u201d and there are any number of \u201chawker\u201d or night markets. Real street food in Asia is likely to be dirty and disorganised but also delicious. Here\u2019s how to find the good stuff and ensure you don\u2019t get sick: Be prepared to take a hike The good street-food vendors are unlikely to be located in the main tourist drag. Ask around to discover where the best markets and food are. They\u2019re often off the central strip and decidedly less picturesque. But that\u2019s half the adventure. In Singapore it\u2019s worth heading to the Joo Chiat district, while in Hong Kong the street food stalls, known as dai pai dongs, can be found in alleyways \u2013 and busy streets \u2013 all around the territory.   The longer the queue the better I\u2019ll happily join the longest queue for street food without even knowing what\u2019s been served up. If everyone else wants it, it must be good. Think of it as a culinary lucky dip as to what you\u2019ll actually be eating.      A street vendor makes sweets along the street to sell them to devotees during the Gadhimai Mela festival in Bariyapur, Nepal. Photograph: Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters    Don\u2019t look for the menu Often there\u2019s no menu, or if there is one it\u2019s unlikely to be in English. Your best bet is to have a stickybeak at what is being cooked and at what everyone else is eating. \u201cI\u2019ll have what she\u2019s having\u201d is a handy movie line to use in the local language. Beware of menus with translations in four different languages and coloured flags marking the language. That\u2019s your cue to run a mile. Get your timing right Often you\u2019ve got to be up early or late to get the best street food. During the heat of the day many vendors shut down so do some research on the best time to eat before you cross town. It\u2019s all about eating where and when the locals eat.  Get some local knowledge Local knowledge goes a long way when it comes to street food. An online search of local food bloggers is often helpful and I\u2019ve also had some great experiences by going on street-food tours. In Singapore Tony Tan\u2019s walking food tour gave me an intriguing introduction to Singapore\u2019s history and politics as well as food while in Delhi a local food writer and blogger, Pamela Timms at Eat and Dust, directed me to her regular rickshaw driver who took me down all sorts of laneways to discover places I would never have found alone.  Keep clean Personally I suspect when I\u2019ve had food poisoning travelling a bad \u201cwestern\u201d meal at a restaurant or hotel has more often been the culprit than the street food I\u2019ve scoffed along the way. But if you are wary of the Imodium express, going to busy and popular places means the food hasn\u2019t been sitting there all day and is likely to be fresh. Avoid salads which may have been washed in tap water, fruit that is already cut up and iced drinks using local water. A small bottle of hand sanitiser or some baby wipes to clean your hands are indispensable. They also come in handy for cleaning eating utensils like the reusable plastic chopsticks used at many Asian street-food stalls.

The move by Just Group, which owns major retail brands including Just Jeans, Smiggle, Peter Alexander, Portmans, and Dotti, is in response to the government\u2019s failure to impose taxes on international companies selling to Australians over the internet. The chair of Just Group, Solomon Lew, said he has no choice as the government\u2019s inaction in responding to a changing online retail structure has left Australian retailers at a significant disadvantage. Products bought from overseas for under $1,000 do not attract the 10% GST charge, and Australian retailers have for several years argued that changes are needed to create a level playing field. \u201cAs a direct result of government delays and inaction, I have been left with no choice and I will be asking my executive team, in 2015, to find the path to ship online product to customers into Australia GST and duty-free,\u201d Lew told the annual general meeting for Premier Investments on Friday. Premier Investments could sell its products online to Australian residents through already established operations in New Zealand, Singapore and soon Britain, at a cheaper price by avoiding the 10% GST and customs duties of up to a further 10%. Guardian Australia understands the move would likely involve some job losses. The company employs about 6,000 people in Australia. Lew\u2019s comments were made amid renewed anger at an Australia Post service launched in November which forwards online purchases to Australian consumers from the US. He said it was incomprehensible that the government-owned entity could offer a service which equated to \u201cthe effective avoidance\u201d of GST and customs duties. Lew rubbished claims that to apply the GST to all overseas purchases, not just those over $1000, was not cost-effective because of the resources needed to police it. Lew, along with other Australian retailers including the head of Myer, Paul McClintock, and Harvey Norman\u2019s chair, Gerry Harvey, have long lobbied for the changes to the GST \u201cloophole\u201d. Harvey last month accused Australia Post of \u201caiding and abetting\u201d GST-dodging consumers.  The Australia Post managing director rejected the accusation, and said the service was about connecting Australians with products and services they couldn\u2019t otherwise get. \u201cIt is completely wrong to say this is about the avoidance of GST,\u201d Ahmed Fahour told the Australian Financial Review. \u201cIt\u2019s about the inability of some overseas retailers to deliver what Australian shoppers want to buy or access.\u201d  The chief executive of Premier Retail, Mark McInnes, told reporters on Friday Premier was not already using those overseas companies to bring in goods GST-free, because the company had desired to be a responsible corporate citizen. \u201cWe at all times have complied with Australian law, and I think we\u2019ve just got to the point where, if the government is not willing to act, we will look after our own interests,\u201d McInnes said. Lew said the Australian government needed to follow the lead of those in Britain, the US, Canada and Europe, who had already acted to ensure fair competition in their retail markets. \u201cUrgent action is needed to ensure that this vibrant and key component of the Australian economy is able to operate under fair competitive rules,\u201d Mr Lew said. Premier also said the expansion of its Smiggle stores into the UK market was proceeding very well. It expects to have more than 25 Smiggle stores trading in Britain by the end of the 2014-15 financial year, and up to 200 UK stores over the next five years.

Increasing urbanisation doesn\u2019t necessarily mean less sustainable transport Densely populated cities present economic, environmental and social challenges, but they might actually work in favour of highly-efficient transport systems designed for the masses. Rupert Fausset, principal sustainability adviser at Forum for the Future said:   Cities are powerhouses of the economy. But a well-planned, dense city can actually make sustainable mobility easier as active travel (biking, walking) and public transport work well in that situation.  2. Technologies and big data should be the servants...  Big data is becoming increasingly important as a tool to track movements of goods and people, but technologies should be applied contextually, not as blanket problem-solving mechanisms. Simon Giles, director of smart city strategy at Accenture, commented:   Too often we lead with the technology or data and look for problems to solve. Where I am seeing it work best, the cities are spending time understanding the anthropology of communities and then formulating responses rather than randomly doing things because they can and it enables them to say they have a \u2018smart\u2019 city strategy/programme.  3. ...but they\u2019re sometimes also the master, especially when it comes to logistics Peter Harris, director of sustainability for Europe at UPS, emphasised the value of data in city logistics. \u201cData is crucial for making mobility efficient,\u201d he said.  According to Transport for London, 17% of all traffic in London is due to deliveries and collections, rising to 25% in central London. These journeys can be made more efficient through data-powered route planning, which can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road.  Data can also be used to make better and more informed transport decisions during large-scale events, as it was during the 2012 Olympics, added Freddie Talberg, CEO of PIE mapping. 4. Technology can help with \u2018last mile\u2019 challenges \u201cLast mile\u201d challenges for home deliveries have come about largely owing to the rise of online shopping. \u201cWhere technology can help for freight, is home deliveries,\u201d said Thomas Zunder, principal research associate at the Newcastle Centre for Railway Research. \u201cNot just customers choosing alternative delivery locations for UPS or FedEx or Royal Mail, but using smartphones to voluntarily track locations so that a carrier can dynamically track down a customer, avoid a failed delivery and save carbon.\u201d 5. Smart city transport schemes are less about technology and more about people and policies There are great examples of city transport innovation, like variable messaging signs to change the nature of road use in Barcelona, or integration of different types of data in Singapore, but when closely examined, the innovations that have truly succeeded are those which incorporate human-focused policy. There is a lot of technology available, but you need to understand human and traffic flows first, and design policies which cater to these patterns. \u201cYou need to do the field anthropology,\u201d said Giles. 6. A major trend in sustainable city transport is the rise of e-mobility The \u201ce\u201d in e-mobility refers to electric and autonomous vehicles, and the communication technologies and connected grid which will enable a shift to low-carbon transport, which the panel pointed out is the way of the future. Asked about future trends, Harris said: \u201cInitially e-vehicles, then e-assisted tricycles, then we may see assistance from drones. Smart grids will tie all this together.\u201d 7. The power of the sun presents many opportunities, but the grid needs to adapt The panel was positive about the potential of solar power to drive forward sustainable mobility. Using solar to power charging posts for electric vehicles, or even having electric vehicles store solar power, which they then feed back to the grid at night, were some of the ideas suggested. Rick Robinson commented: \u201cThe challenge with finding really innovative ways to share that [solar] power with people who need it \u2013 whether for electric cars or other purposes \u2013 is a more open and accessible smart grid than we have today.\u201d 8. It\u2019s not just about finding more efficient ways to power our vehicles, we need to reduce traffic and energy use too The panel agreed that although there is much promise in alternative power sources, traffic levels and infrastructure need to be tackled as well. Rick Robinson, executive architect at IBM, Smarter Cities, said:   There are many examples of areas and communities in cities that have real economic and social problems created by the transport infrastructures that pass through them. It\u2019s only by changing the way we use transport and then designing different, less invasive infrastructures that we\u2019ll address those challenges.  9. In the future, it might be practical to dance to work... Combine wacky engineering and disruptive technologies, and you get floors that can harness the energy of your footsteps, or trampoline roads that don\u2019t use any energy at all. There are lots of examples of unusual ways in which engineers are thinking outside the box and designing transport infrastructure which is smart, sustainable and creative, but \u201cYou just need to make sure you don\u2019t try and break the laws of physics,\u201d said Fausset. 10. ...but we need more engineers to come up with creative transport solutions Mark Walker, general manager of ZipCar UK, was excited:   The idea of dancing all night and the energy of my gyrations powering the mobility device that drives me home sounds like a near perfect world.\u201d   Putting our enthusiasm aside, piezoelectric-powered surfaces and trampoline roads won\u2019t design themselves. Robinson said: \u201cEngineering is one of the most exciting career paths I can think of at the moment, and one that should be highlighted throughout the education process.

But, like other metropolitan hubs, they faced the inevitable problem of heavy congestion at peak time between 8am and 8.45am. Part of the solution has come in the form of an incentive for passengers: if they registered their smart travel cards and commuted in the hour after these peak times, they would earn points which can be used in a raffle to win cash. The scheme was the result of work by California-based Urban Engines, which uses data from travel cards, like the Oyster card in London, along with GPS data from trains and buses to draw up a detailed model of how the residents of a city move through their transport system. The results in turn show where problems lay. Drawing up this living profile in Singapore and the subsequent incentives resulted in a drop of peak hour travel of between 7% and 13%, according to the company. \u201cAll these things are piecemeal and siloed at this point but it is really a jigsaw puzzle. If you actually put together the information that is coming from smart cards and from GPSs, then you can start figuring out what are the true traffic patterns in a city,\u201d said Shiva Shivakumar, a co-founder and chief executive of the company. \u201cEvery single bus, every single train, every single road segment, every single time. You can start seeing the patterns emerge from that. What happens when there is a big event going on? What happens if it rains? What happens when there is fog?\u201d added Shivakumar, who spent 10 years at Google working on Gmail and Google Maps among other projects. Another of the company\u2019s founders, Balaji Prabhakar, specialises in keeping internet sites running when they are getting heavy traffic. When he was stuck in heavy car traffic in Bangalore in 2007, he pondered whether the two problems could be solved in a similar way. Separately, Shivakumar was questioning whether his work in Google in making the email system faster could also be put to use in urban traffic situations. The pair came together in Stanford, California, to work on the problem and apply large amounts of data to make cities move more fluidly. \u201cHow do we use some of the ideas that we had on the web \u2026 in terms of the real world and make the mobility experience a lot faster and better?\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cThere is a fundamental growing problem around the world.\u201d Transport authorities give Urban Engines the commuter fare card information and GPS details of train and bus systems. Fare card information from when commuters tap in and out allows the company to gauge the commuting pattern \u2013 how long people are waiting, the number of trains which passed which were too full to get on \u2013 and concludes how a system is working at any one time. \u201cWe take all that information with our data sets which have information about the entire city \u2013 all the roads, all the buses, all the trains. We take all that with the online city information which is open. There is a lot of open data \u2013 for example for roads, where are the bus stops? Where are the train stations, how long does it take to get from one train station to the next bus stop? We have processed that already, very similar to Google maps or Apple maps. We take all of that information and build up an analytical platform for all of that information,\u201d said Shivakumar. In practice, the information which is fed back to the transport authority is shown on a screen with a copy of the grid of the railway or bus system. It shows each individual train or bus snaking around their route with meters above them showing how full each one is. Figures illustrate how many commuters are in each station and the waiting times. By analysing this information, it can be decided where more trains and buses are needed or, if that is not possible, how commuters can be incentivised to travel outside of peak times in order to lessen the loads, as in Singapore, or else encourage commuters to move to an underused station as opposed to one which is over capacity. The pilot study for the system was conducted in Bangalore where incentives such as lottery tickets were used to switch an estimated 17% of commuters from their regular pattern. Another study took place in Stanford. The system is now being used in Sao Paulo in Brazil to help manage the 17,000-strong bus fleet while it is in its early stages in Washington DC. \u201cThey [transport authorities] have had average data until now which has been working well for them for a while but now the commuter patterns are changing quite a bit more,\u201d said Shivakumar. \u201cIn the US they have a 45mph speed limit on certain roads. That is an optimal speed that you want to go, and the reason that came about is because there was a research study a few years back where they looked at what is happening on average. \u201cAnd so a lot of the decisions have been made from average data as opposed to, in some cases, you want to go at a much higher speed or a much lower speed depending on the weather conditions. That is what is now possible because of the data. You can make much more nuanced decisions about how to optimise your networks.\u201d Attempting to tackle congestion, which is estimated to cost economies multiple billions every year, has attracted the attention of some heavyweight investors to Urban Engines. So far, Google chairman, Eric Schmidt, and Google Ventures are among those who have put money into the early-stage company, although how much or a valuation for the firm has not yet been released. Traditional methods If transport managers want to understand and locate congestion hotspots, conventional methods have been to send human surveyors to watch and analyse their results, or else use video cameras to assess the information across a range of different stations, according to Shivakumar. Another method is to use weighing scales for trains and work out the number on board by dividing by the average weight. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have weighing scales for platforms for example if you want to know how many people are waiting at each station,\u201d he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/08/jan-gehl-make-cities-liveable-urban-rethinker", "sentences": ["\u201cPresently we are even asked to do bicycle systems for Singapore."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-08T10:21:46Z", "title": "Is Jan Gehl winning his battle to make our cities liveable?", "tags": ["Cities", "Architecture", "Urbanisation"], "article": "Jan Gehl had just graduated as an architect; it was 1960 and he had been schooled in how to \u201cdo modern cities, with high-rises and a lot of lawns and good open space \u2013 good windy spaces\u201d. About to put those years of study into practice, he met his future wife, psychologist Ingrid Mundt, and everything changed. In the years that followed, he would develop the thinking that has made him a pioneer of so-called \u201cliveable cities\u201d around the world. Meeting Ingrid, someone who had studied \u201cpeople rather than bricks\u201d, says Gehl over the phone from Copenhagen, catalysed a host of discussions between young architects and young psychologists questioning why architects were not really interested in people, how architecture can \u201cinfluence people\u2019s lives\u201d, and \u201chow cities are used by people\u201d. Ultimately the idea was to think up ways to make cities \u201cthat people would be happier using\u201d. Typically, says the 78-year-old \u2013 not long off a plane from Japan but sounding sharp \u2013 \u201cthe main focus [of urban planning] has been to keep the cars happy\u201d. But Gehl, bolstered by psychological thinking, spent the next 40 years developing principles based on how the shape of cities can impact on the human lives lived within them, rather than on traffic efficiency and parking spaces.     Jan Gehl.  Photograph: Henningsson/Gehl Architects    He developed a data-driven approach. In 1965, in Siena, he and Ingrid drew up the first rudimentary \u201cPSPL\u201d: a public space/public life survey. The basic idea is to count how many people are in a space, then determine how they are using it. This data is used as a baseline for recommendations on how to improve the liveability of the city or neighbourhood in question.  These methods and principles, developed and refined since the 1960s, are \u201creadily available to be used to make existing cities and new developments much better\u201d. Members of Gehl\u2019s Copenhagen firm, established in 2000 with one of his students, Helle S\u00f8holt, recite them like mantras: conversations are infected with enthusiasm and built around words such as \u201cliveability\u201d, \u201cliveliness\u201d and \u201cdensity\u201d. These ideas, Gehl firmly believes, can be applied universally, bending to each new city or neighbourhood challenge \u2013 be that recent conflict, climate or unfettered urban sprawl. His firm has worked on projects in cities all over the world, including: developing downtown areas in rapidly sprawling S\u00e3o Paolo; creating cycling opportunities in 20-million strong Mexico City; reclaiming public space for a majority Palestinian refugee population in an area of eastern Amman; developing the UK\u2019s first shared-space street in Brighton, re-imagining the use of space in New York\u2019s Times Square, and opening Moscow up for pedestrians. Most of the criteria for assessing a space\u2019s quality \u2013 Gehl cites 12, including protection against unpleasant sensory experiences and invitations for visual contact \u2013 come from the human body and the human senses: \u201cHow we move, how our senses work, why homo sapiens like to stay in the corner where you can see the whole space.\u201d There might be differences around the world, he concedes, but there are many more similarities \u201cbased on the species we are\u201d. Practice partner S\u00f8holt puts forward one way of improving a city\u2019s liveability: \u201cMix the city and assemble the people rather than dispersing them.\u201d In direct opposition to the modernist school of architecture which Gehl graduated into, with its \u201csystem-oriented thinking \u2026 separate the areas: industrial quarter, cultural quarters, living quarters\u201d, lively cities are, in this vision, ones in which each neighbourhood offers access to all the necessary social infrastructure: access to health, to school facilities, to workplaces. Cities need to be compact, and complex.      Gehl has re-imagined public spaces in New York.  Photograph: Gehl Architects    For S\u00f8holt it\u2019s also about opening buildings up, \u201cso you can actually look into buildings and see other people \u2013 the opposite of gated communities\u201d. By bringing the neighbourhood\u2019s human faces out on to the street, on to ground level, cities are also made safer, he suggests.  This is precisely what Gehl\u2019s team have been trying to do in S\u00e3o Paulo where, since the end of the dictatorship in the 1980s, urban planning has taken a back seat to sprawl. In the central Anhangaba\u00fa Square, they are working to improve access, create smaller human-scale spaces, make a more flexible city space for different uses, and activate the edges of the square by opening its building facades. \u201cWe use the Danish word for \u2018cuddly\u2019 [hygge] and say, let\u2019s make it nice and warm and cosy,\u201d says the practice\u2019s director, Riccardo Marini. \u201cThe hard-nosed amongst us might turn round and say, \u2018what\u2019s that got to do with anything?\u2019\u2026 Well, it\u2019s got a lot to do with making a place good so people will want to stay there.\u201d For cities to be liveable, according to S\u00f8holt, people also need to have \u201cfreedom of choice in terms of mobility. According to what your daily needs are, you can walk, you can bicycle, you can take public transport. For that to work, the city has to be compact enough.\u201d      A Gehl Architects project in downtown S\u00e3o Paolo     One city working to make transport truly \u201con demand\u201d is Helsinki, which is developing a system that integrates all forms of shared and public transport in a single payment network. If they manage it, Gehl thinks, \u201cthey will really be a pioneer of something that will become much more widespread. We can easily make cities where you don\u2019t need individual cars for each individual\u2019s transportation.\u201d A lot of Gehl\u2019s work has focused on the bicycle, a mode of transport he thinks is only going to become more common \u2013 thanks to higher petrol prices, increasing concern for health meaning people are encouraged to be more active, and city dwellers finding it is faster to go by bike than get stuck in traffic jams. This, Gehl proffers, is true the world over. \u201cPresently we are even asked to do bicycle systems for Singapore. You\u2019d have thought that would be the last place \u2013 with all the heat down there, and the humidity \u2013 but not so, they need bicycles as an extra means to get around because of congestion.\u201d Of London\u2019s \u201ccycle superhighway\u201d plans, however, Gehl is sceptical. For starters: \u201cI don\u2019t like the word \u2018superhighway\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019ve got that word from another branch of transportation.\u201d And, he adds, these lanes will only ever get you part of the way. \u201cThen, the last half-kilometre, cyclists will have to take chances in places where there is no infrastructure.\u201d Much better if, as in Copenhagen, these grander cycles lanes also filter into good bicycle lanes on every street: \u201cThat makes it a system which is safe from door to door.\u201d     Transport for London\u2019s segregated cycle lane plan for Blackfriars junction Photograph: Tfl    If a city\u2019s compactness arguably opens up freedom of choice when it comes to getting around, a new frontier in the debate is urban densification \u2013 but this should not, in Gehl\u2019s view, mean high rises: \u201cWe should make cities six to seven storeys high, like they did in Paris in the good old days.\u201d \u201cAll over the world, we need to find ways of densifying our cities,\u201d S\u00f8holt suggests. \u201cPeople are moving from suburbs to urban areas or even from countryside to cities. But what does it mean if that density also needs to improve people\u2019s quality of life?\u201d  To S\u00f8holt, it means balancing urban density with green space \u2013 and densifying transport hubs, something she is thinking about a lot at the moment: \u201cRather than densify or expand our communities, even building on green fields, it\u2019s really important that we densify our cities around the core infrastructure. \u201c[Transport hubs] are the most logical place to meet and to have new workplaces, to have extensions of university departments or even living apartments,\u201d says S\u00f8holt. The development around King\u2019s Cross in London is, in her eyes, a good example of where the \u201curban tissue has been stitched together again\u201d. But what of the idea that all this regeneration is pushing lower-income people out, as neighbourhoods are gentrified? For Gehl, the emphasis needs to be on social inclusion. \u201cWhen we do city planning, we can make sure it will be a good place for children to grow up, and for the growing number of elderly people to live for many years after they retire.\u201d He wants an onus on governments to take measures such as \u201cdemanding that a certain amount of all new housing be made low profit or social housing or for low-income groups\u201d. Copenhagen city rules state that 20% of housing in new districts should be affordable.     Piazza del Campo in Siena. Photograph: Giorgio Magini/Getty Images    Ultimately, S\u00f8holt says, the need to curb gentrification feeds into another key strand of today\u2019s liveability debate: urban flexibility. \u201cThe city gets awfully boring if it\u2019s all super-expensive, super-high-quality everything. We need a bit of that urbanism which is about diversity, about leaving the unknown \u2026 if it\u2019s not there we need to find mechanisms for it to flourish \u2013 the cheap amongst the expensive.\u201d  Thus, she believes one priority of the city planner should be to leave room for neighbourhoods to manoeuvre of their own accord. \u201cWe work a lot with pilot projects and temporary things, so you can shake up the permanence of the city and actually offer alternatives.\u201d Such thinking is, of course, rooted in the same principles by which cities were being organised centuries ago. We\u2019ve been enjoying pleasurable tickling \u201csince we crawled out the trees\u201d, says Marini, as proof that there\u2019s no reason why principles of urban planning based on what it is to be human should need to change dramatically, even as cities develop. \u201cIf you look at some of the most famous old squares in the world, like the Campo in Siena,\u201d Gehl says, looking again to those 12 quality criteria for a space, \u201cyou will find to your surprise that all criteria are completely met.\u201d It\u2019s just that all of this accumulated experience \u201chas been lost in the translation to modern times\u201d.  And so it falls to those designing our cities today to \u201cpainstakingly find them again, and apply them again\u201d.

In 2011, in the afterglow of the extraordinary coup of landing the World Cup in 2022 in controversial circumstances that are still unravelling, the Qatar Olympic Committee was engaged in lobbying the International Olympic Committee in its attempt to pull off an amazing double and land the 2020 Olympics. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir, was president of the QOC and only too aware of the strategy pursued by his father of using sport to expand the country\u2019s global reach and influence. It is a strategy allied to investments in property and businesses around the globe. The email exchanges are a reminder of the extent to which the interests of the Qatari royal family, their various business interests, social policies and petty internal politics are intermingled. Business leaders, perhaps keen to impress the emir, provide updates on their efforts to further Qatar\u2019s sporting interests abroad. No stone is left unturned. The way in which sport should fit into the former emir\u2019s so-called 2030 vision is constantly emphasised but the vision often seems curiously simplistic. \u201cIt is important Qatar creates a branding for itself to showcase its resources. This needs to be done with combined efforts from all different sectors,\u201d reads one memo following a meeting with Jacques Rogge, the then IOC president who was sceptical about Doha\u2019s bids for the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games. The footer on all the QOC\u2019s emails reads \u201cVision: To Become a Leading Nation in Bringing the World Together Through Sport\u201d. It is clear the jewel in the crown is the bid for the Olympic Games and there appears a degree of tension between the team bidding to bring the 2016 and 2020 Olympics to the Gulf and the successful 2022 World Cup bid team, which shocked the world when it secured the tournament in December 2010. Among the emails are the flight details for Sepp Blatter, the Fifa president, and his delegation who swooped in to Doha to seal the deal the following month. There is endless back and forth before the Copenhagen IOC Congress in 2009 over the right way to approach Rogge and key IOC members in order to get them onside later in the year with a plan to host the Olympic Games. A key part of the strategy was to get the heads of all the major sports federations on board with a proposal to shift the start of the Olympics to late September to avoid the questions about the searing summer heat that have hamstrung Qatar\u2019s World Cup preparations. The emails appear to show Rogge suggesting they get confirmation in writing from each of the federations. Of those, none is more important than athletics, the blue riband sport of any Games. They cover a time when the QOC had been lobbying the IAAF president, Lamine Diack, to agree to change the dates for the 2017 world athletics championships and the 2020 Olympic Games. Both bids were ultimately unsuccessful. For Doha\u2019s Olympic bid to succeed in being put on the shortlist, the approval of Diack for a proposal to shift the Games to late September was seen as vital. After the QOC failed with a bid for the 2016 Games and spent two years preparing the ground for a bid to host the 2020 Olympics with the IOC, in February 2011 Rogge told the Doha bid team to secure the agreement of the heads of the major international federations for the potential date change. Despite a number of entreaties, Diack did not appear to respond to requests for his views on whether the dates can be changed not only for the 2020 Games but also for the 2017 world athletics championships. According to the emails, QOC sent messages to the IAAF via email and fax including on 10 May, 19 July and 26 July. Diack replied on 4 August and Papa Massata Diack wrote to the QOC shortly afterwards, enclosing a complete file of the correspondence. The IAAF has confirmed Lamine Diack wrote to the QOC over the date change in August 2011, days before the IOC deadline. He said he was happy for the Games to take place in late September and early October. It said his decision was based on the fact the Sydney Olympics had taken place at a similar time of year and had not posed a problem. If the Qataris could have landed the 2017 world championships, for which they were going head to head with a Lord Coe-fronted bid from London, it would have proved an important vote of confidence in their plans to stage an autumn Olympics. This is where Papa Massata Diack, Lamine\u2019s son, appeared keen to emphasise his involvement. He writes to the QOC to deliver the confirmation letter in August, shortly after the IOC\u2019s deadline for a response. \u201cAs promised to you, please find attached the letter sent by the IAAF president of the dates of the world championships 2017 and the 2020 Olympic Games,\u201d he says, before going on to offer a sponsorship opportunity for Qatar Airways \u201cor any Qatar company interested in the German market\u201d. It is also clear money is no object for the Qataris. One representative of the QOC goes to see a major US broadcaster to try to persuade it to allow Qatar to underwrite a huge joint bid for the television rights to the Olympic Games, on the understanding that it would drop its longstanding opposition to shifting the dates. The ploy did not work, with concern from US broadcasters among the reasons why Doha did not progress to the final shortlist. The Doha bid for the 2017 world athletics championships lost out to London in November 2011 by a vote of 16 to 10, despite a last-ditch attempt to close the deal through a financial package worth $236m. A similar tactic proved successful last month, when Doha won the right to the 2019 championships \u2013 to be held in late September \u2013 with a bid that also included a last-minute \u201cinducement\u201d of $37m to be met by an as yet unnamed Qatari bank. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Odriozola, a Spanish IAAF executive, complained about the move. \u201cAll they have is money,\u201d he said, after Doha beat bids from Barcelona and Eugene in the US. The IAAF said no rules had been broken and offers to cover prize money and deliver additional funding to the sport were encouraged. The Doha bid for the 2020 Olympic Games fell at the shortlist stage in May 2012, much to the private fury of some on the bid team, amid concerns from US broadcasters over scheduling if the Games was moved to September or October. If the exchanges seen by the Guardian prove anything, it is that the Qataris are nothing if not persistent and remain relentless in their desire to bring the world\u2019s biggest sporting events to the tiny Gulf state. Following Doha\u2019s successful bid to host the 2019 world athletics championships, most IOC observers fully expect it to re-enter the race for the biggest prize of all. An earlier bid for the 2016 Olympics had also fallen at the first hurdle but Qatar is expected to try again for 2024, either on its own or as part of a coalition of Gulf states. Meanwhile athletics is engulfed in accusations about institutional doping. This week, Papa Massata Diack was forced to deny claims he was involved in an alleged cover-up surrounding the doping claims involving Russia . The German broadcaster WDR claimed a company involved in covering up the positive tests of the marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova, through which hush money was refunded to her after she was later banned, was linked to Papa Massata Diack. He confirmed to WDR he had business links with the Chinese owner of the Singapore-registered company, which was called Black Tidings and subsequently liquidated. He said he was not linked with the company itself, either as a partner or in an advisory capacity. The French sports daily L\u2019Equipe has also raised questions about meetings in Moscow hotels in 2011 between Valentin Balakhnichev, the president of the Russian Athletics Federation and an IAAF council member, a legal adviser to the IAAF named Habib Cisse and Papa Massata Diack. In an interview with L\u2019Equipe on Wednesday Lamine Diack said his 50-year-old son was big enough to look after himself and would deal with the claims when he returned from a trip to China to look for sponsors. Diack reaffirmed his faith in the IAAF ethics commission but raised the prospect of intermediate action being taken before the end of the week. The long tenure of his 81-year-old father, Lamine, who has been president of the IAAF since 1999 and will stand down next year, has also been eventful. The Senegalese was one of the non-football names included on a list of those bribed by the now defunct Swiss sports marketing agency ISL to the tune of $100m, which was leaked to the BBC in 2010. According to the list obtained by Panorama, Diack received $41,500 in three tranches at a time when he was not yet president of the IAAF or a member of the IOC. He was admonished by the IOC, of which he became a member by virtue of his IAAF presidency, but denied wrongdoing. He claimed the payment was a gift from friends after his house in Senegal burned down without insurance in 1993. Amid doping allegations and the consequences of Doha\u2019s dash for new markets, the only thing that is clear is that the size of the task facing the IAAF presidential hopeful Lord Coe or his likely opponent Sergey Bubka if they ascend to the top job has become even bigger."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/11/verse-queers-in-love-at-the-end-of-the-world-anna-anthropy", "sentences": ["I played Queers whenIn QueensIn JFK securityI played by text whenThe textCome backThe textI miss youIII The world endsThe world endsThe sunset over QueensPlanes over QueensThere isn\u2019tSecurity search meBecause I\u2019mNot from fear but IThe bomb in my chestHas noTimeMotherfucker never loved us To stare, naked and human, at that timerThat tyrannical timer of QueersAnd wish to become a timewitch to manipulate time and spaceBecome superhuman to tear open a rift to exist in the ether of tomorrow and all timeTo stop time and all the words and the shift of existence to look at youTo look at your face by the subway stop and urge you:Suggest something impossibleSuggest something wonderfulSuggest that we eat the sun or fuck the windSuggest that we set fire to music--But you look at that symbol of limits and say, cowed:I can\u2019t come to the airport AmsterdamI play Queers whenMalaysiaThere isn\u2019t time toTokyoTokyoOver timezonesThe emails orIMs toHow do I writeSingaporeWhy isn\u2019t there a I play Queers whenIn the new sunrise over Queens5am dinerTake CareThere shouldn\u2019t be time toBrooklynThere isn\u2019tKyrat I play Queers whenIt dawns in BrooklynBy incense andBy Illmatic andThere\u2019s still no point inYou sleep tilProspect Park by iced ponds andM83 over red leavesI shouldn\u2019t have eaten that appleThere\u2019s time toBut there\u2019s no time to I kiss you fiercelyYou push me down Softly.Slowly.Fiercely.Hungrily."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-11T10:33:43Z", "title": "A verse about Queers in Love at the End of the World", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Game culture", "Indie games", "PC"], "article": "It\u2019s important to me to seek out games that say something powerful about aspects of my life.

It has no values and works indifferently either for or against freedom and democracy. But however it is employed, it works powerfully. So it has become an arena in which struggles over power and ideas are fought out all across the world. This is not just a matter of competing messages. Governments want to control what is said and what is heard and where they can\u2019t control it, then at any rate to listen in and take advantage of what they learn there. When the power of the internet first became apparent, the obvious resort of government was simply to ban or block access to sources of information that political leadership found displeasing. But, as a recently released report from the Washington-based thinktank Freedom House\u00a0points out, there is now a growing tendency to use more sophisticated methods. A recent study in Science magazine showed how the Chinese censorship regime lets through any amount of criticism of the party or its officials but clamps down hard on\u00a0anything that might inspire political action. And here in Britain, a woman has just been jailed for five years for inciting terrorism in Syria on\u00a0Facebook. Other countries are just as authoritarian but less subtle about it. Out of 65 countries assessed by Freedom House, 36 have seen a deterioration of online freedom. The worst examples are in Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, where media users and online journalists were targeted by the Yanukovych regime during the Euromaidan protest. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, called Twitter \u201cthe worst menace to society\u201d, and Vladimir Putin has called the internet a \u201cCIA operation\u201d. In May his government passed a so-called bloggers law that requires any site drawing more than 3,000 daily viewers to register with the telecommunications regulator \u2013 an approach intended to inhibit independent reporting of the Putin regime. There is now a frightening number of Russian laws repressing free speech online, which authorities often describe as \u201cextremism\u201d. It is especially worrying that repressive techniques are being mimicked from one country to the next. The Snowden revelations led to a healthy debate on how a democratic country, the United States, as well as some of its allies, carries out massive online surveillance. But repressive regimes have seized upon this to introduce more online repression that increasingly leads to detentions. Surveillance, in these countries, is now used not just to collect huge amounts of data but to punish dissent and lock people up. The revelations of NSA activity, says Freedom House, have served \u201cas an excuse\u201d for some governments to \u201caugment their own monitoring capabilities\u201d. In Bahrain, malicious links have been used to identify and arrest several anonymous Twitter users who were outspoken against the government. Kazakhstan adopted legislation similar to Russia\u2019s in order to crack down on digital media carrying criticism of the authorities. In Bangladesh and in Singapore, government reprisals have focused on social media posts critical of political leaders. Iranian authorities have continued to hand down harsh punishments, sentencing some users to lengthy prison terms for their digital activities. The Syrian regime, in the midst of an ongoing civil war, has an army of hackers that infected 10,000 computers with\u00a0malware. The Syrian regime shows off another worrying trend: the bad actors are doing their best to take advantage of other countries\u2019 freedoms. The Russians and the Chinese, especially, work tirelessly to infiltrate the systems of the western companies such as Google, Facebook or Apple to which we entrust so many of our secrets and desires. Unlike privateering hackers, they don\u2019t want to release what they find, nor to advertise their exploits. They just want to know everything, and to use for surveillance the mechanisms that have been built for other ends. That, too, is a threat to the freedom with which we may use the internet. There is\u00a0no purely technological fix. The struggle for\u00a0freedom from repression online is in the end just a part of the wider struggle for freedom offline. Activism online cannot substitute for\u00a0action in the physical world, but freedom in each world now depends on freedom in the\u00a0other."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/11/iaafs-most-senior-anti-doping-official-dr-gabriel-dolle-leaves-job", "sentences": ["The German broadcaster ARD claimed it had evidence that a \u20ac300,000 refund to Shobukhova from the Russian federation \u2013 after she had been banned for failing a test \u2013 was channelled through a Singapore-based company called Black Tidings, which was owned by a Chinese business partner of Papa Massata Diack."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-11T20:24:37Z", "title": "IAAF\u2019s most senior anti-doping official, Dr Gabriel Doll\u00e9, leaves job", "tags": ["IAAF", "Athletics", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "article": "The most senior anti-doping official in athletics has left his post after being interviewed by the world governing body\u2019s ethics commission, the Guardian can reveal. Dr Gabriel Doll\u00e9, the director of the medical and anti-doping department at the International Association of Athletics Federations, was an important figure in the body, with the job of overseeing all doping-related aspects of IAAF events, athletes and associated matters. The Frenchman was also responsible for working closely with the World Anti-Doping Agency and other national anti-doping agencies. It is the latest blow to the IAAF, which has been rocked by a series of allegations over the past week. On Thursday the IAAF marketing adviser Papa Massata Diack \u2013 the son of the IAAF president, Lamine Diack \u2013 agreed to step down, as did Valentin Balakhnichev, president of the Russian athletics federation and the IAAF\u2019s treasurer, pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of institutionalised doping in Russia. The Guardian has seen the document that formed the basis of a story in the French newspaper L\u2019Equipe this week about the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova which alleged that two members of the Russian Athletics Federation extorted \u20ac450,000 from her in return for covering up a positive test. That document, a submission from Shobukhova\u2019s team to the IAAF ethics commission, includes Doll\u00e9\u2019s name several times. It is, however, unclear to what extent Doll\u00e9 will be implicated in the ethics commission\u2019s investigation. The German broadcaster ARD claimed it had evidence that a \u20ac300,000 refund to Shobukhova from the Russian federation \u2013 after she had been banned for failing a test \u2013 was channelled through a Singapore-based company called Black Tidings, which was owned by a Chinese business partner of Papa Massata Diack. The Senegalese, an IAAF marketing consultant with exclusive rights to sell sponsorship in developing regions, joined the under-pressure Balakhnichev in agreeing to step down. The IAAF issued a statement confirming Papa Massata Diack is suspending his activities and that it \u201cappreciates the gesture of council member Valentin Balakhnichev, who has been the subject of recent media allegations, who has voluntarily decided to cease exercising his duties as IAAF treasurer and council member until the independent IAAF ethics commission\u2019s ongoing investigation has concluded. \u201cIAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack has also written to the IAAF confirming that he will suspend his activities on behalf of the IAAF until the commission has delivered its final report.\u201d The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that emails suggested Papa Massata Diack requested a $5m payment \u2013 $440,000 of it in cash \u2013 from Qatar in October 2011, during the race to host the 2017 World Athletics Championships. It is not clear whether the payment was made. The IAAF said no contract between it or the state investment entities QSI or Oryx QSI \u2013 or any other Qatari companies \u2013 had been signed during that period. An IAAF spokesman said he had spoken to Papa Massata Diack and he had denied \u201creceiving any such payment nor ever acting in such a manner on behalf of the IAAF\u201d. The Senegalese has a contract to represent the IAAF\u2019s commercial interests in several developing markets including Qatar, China, Russia and South Korea. It is understood that at a meeting of the IAAF\u2019s executive committee on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the allegations engulfing the sport several of those present insisted that pressure be put on the pair to step down while the ethics commission, chaired by the eminent British QC Michael Beloff, completes its work. There were also calls in that meeting for Habib Ciss\u00e9, an IAAF legal adviser, to stand down given questions raised by a L\u2019Equipe story about meetings in Moscow hotels in 2011 between himself, Balakhnichev and Papa Massata Diack. But Ciss\u00e9 told the Guardian on Thursday night that he remained an adviser to the IAAF, for which he has been a lawyer for 12 years. \u201cI am not a staff member. The IAAF is one of my clients. I am committed to supporting the ongoing ethics commission investigation. I will co-operate in full and I was one of those who pushed for a truly independent ethics commission,\u201d he said. It is understood that the independent ethics commission has been investigating the doping claims since March and is expected to deliver a verdict within two months. It could theoretically suspend or sanction all those involved, from the president down. Ciss\u00e9 said that the meeting highlighted by L\u2019Equipe was to agree a sponsorship deal for a Russian company that wanted to back the upcoming 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow. He said that as the head of the local organising committee it would be unusual if Balakhnichev was not involved in sponsorship discussions and that he had evidence to put before the ethics commission that would back up his case. In an interview with L\u2019Equipe on Wednesday Lamine Diack said his son was big enough to look after himself and would deal with the claims when he returned from a trip to China to look for sponsors. Lamine Diack, who is 81, is due to stand down as president next year after 16 years in the role.

Yulia Rusanova, who would become his wife, was also forced to take these tablets. He had no financial gain to make. He just wanted to tell the truth and be honest.\u201d Seppelt also insisted the evidence on a leaked list of more than 150 athletes with suspicious blood values, which included three British athletes, was more comprehensive than the International Association of Athletics Federations had suggested. \u201cThe IAAF is trying to give the impression that all the details we had were individual blood values,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is simply not the case. There are several readings for each athlete.\u201d When details of the list were revealed in the German documentary, without revealing any names, the IAAF said the historical blood data gathered was used for target testing purposes. \u201cThis was the practice by the few international federations which were conducting blood tests back then. Abnormal results were duly followed up by the IAAF, whenever possible logistically,\u201d it said. \u201cOne cannot draw any conclusion on whether or not an athlete has doped on the basis of one single blood value.\u201d Athletics has been rocked by the doping claims and a separate Guardian investigation which suggested the son of the IAAF president Lamine Diack requested a $5m payment from the Qataris during the bidding race for the 2017 world championships. The Guardian also revealed that Dr Gabriel Doll\u00e9, the director of the medical and anti-doping department at the IAAF, left his post recently after being interviewed by the ethics commission. Papa Massata Diack, who is the licensed agent for negotiating sponsorship deals in developing markets, has stepped down from his position as an IAAF marketing adviser until an ethics commission investigation into the doping claims has been completed. The Guardian has seen the document that formed the basis of a story in the French newspaper L\u2019Equipe this week about the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova which alleged that two members of the Russian Athletics Federation extorted \u20ac450,000 from her in return for covering up a positive test.

The head of the Russian federation, Valentin Balakhnichev has called the claims \u201ca pack of lies\u201d. Balakhnichev has also stood down from his role as treasurer of the IAAF while the claims are investigated. It is understood that an IAAF executive board meeting earlier this week decided that the pair should stand aside. The IAAF legal adviser Habib Ciss\u00e9, facing questions over a meeting in Moscow with Papa Massata Diack and Balakhnichev, also came under pressure to stand aside while the investigation is completed. However, Cisse hasrefused to stand down and said the meeting in question related to a sponsorship deal that was being negotiated ahead of the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow. Beckie Scott, chair of Wada\u2019s Athletic Committee, said: \u201cI would like to make a statement of strong support for Wada\u2019s decision to launch a full and thorough investigation into the allegations made on German television.

As the rain pogoed off the Glasgow streets, and an icy northerly scythed through the peloton, I swear I saw him gaze towards the heavens. Njoroge was the star of the Kenyan Riders, whose dizzying mission statement is to become the first black African team in the Tour de France. His personal story deserved telling too. Until four years ago he had been a courier, riding 30-50km a day on a rickety bike to deliver 50kg of milk to shops. Having been successful in African races, he desperately wanted to show his talent alongside Team Sky\u2019s Geraint Thomas and Peter Kennaugh. I had hoped to catch him afterwards but of the 140 riders who started the race, only 12 finished. Njoroge was not among them. That was August. Two months later Njoroge was dead. It happened during the Tour of Matabungkay in the Philippines when a car going the other way, whose driver had repeatedly ignored warnings to stop, crashed into him as he went round a bend. Njoroge was 30. He left behind a wife and a baby son. At the team\u2019s headquarters in the Rift Valley they are still trying to make sense of the tragedy. \u201cIt was shocking,\u201d says his team-mate Emmanuel Killy. \u201cHe was the heart of the team. We are still trying to repair it.\u201d Crying is not the done thing for most East African men but after Njoroge\u2019s death eyes became waterfalls. The team have set up an appeal to help his wife and child. So far it has raised $16,000. It is very different to the carnival events of a year ago, when Chris Froome visited Iten after winning the Tour de France. The Riders put a bedsheet on the fence that said: \u201cWelcome Chris Froome\u201d in Swahili. Froome responded by spending hours with the riders, particularly Njoroge, who was aiming to win the Tour of Rwanda, one of Africa\u2019s strongest races, the following week. Njoroge\u2019s coach, Simon Blake, smiles at the memories. \u201cWhen they were getting a photo taken together he grabbed Chris\u2019s hand and placed it on his handlebar because he wanted a bit of yellow on his bike,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cFroome also told us he didn\u2019t expect the setup we have here. He was like: \u2018You guys definitely know what you are doing.\u2019 We were like: \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re not mucking around \u2013 way too much time, energy and money has gone into this team.\u2019\u201d They had pinned much of their hopes on Njoroge, who was still improving. \u201cWhen you put him on a bike in a race, the guy was an animal,\u201d Blake says. \u201cHe could really hurt. He was a fantastic competitor. He wasn\u2019t a macho man in the camp but when it got to serious training he really shined. He didn\u2019t do it very often but sometimes he said: \u2018Today, I need to feel my body.\u2019 He wasn\u2019t trying to annihilate the team, he was just that much better. He came third and fourth in the Tour of Rwanda \u2013 and that\u2019s the race the African and European teams want to win.\u201d His death was a huge setback for the team, as well as a devastating personal loss, but Nicholas Leong, a photographer from Singapore who founded the Kenyan Riders six years ago, is determined to keep going. He felt compelled to come to Iten because one question kept troubling him: why were there no black riders in the peloton? In 2005, having watched Kenyan runners dominate the Singapore marathon, he bought a ticket to Iten on a whim. Nearly a decade on, and having spent $250,000 of his own money, the solution is not as easy as he had hoped. In theory, the fact many Kenyans in Iten have huge aerobic engines, which are strengthened by the 8,000ft altitude and the Rift Valley\u2019s steep slopes, should mean they are perfect for cycling. The problem is the very best athletes prefer to run. Running is cheaper \u2013 and the rewards are obvious, especially when people see David Rudisha or Dennis Kimetto, the world marathon record-holder, jog past. As Leong concedes, he is drawing from a smaller talent pool. \u201cOur first generation of riders were essentially using their bicycles for a living, hauling firewood or being taxi operators,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we have a scholarship programme to get the next generation interested in cycling. We want to find our David Rudisha. But few kids in Iten have bikes.\u201d To increase interest and improve bike skills, the team have built a pump track, with mounds and ramps at their headquarters. Most days a bunch of teens can be found recreating a scene from BMX Bandits. Meanwhile, Blake, a blunt Aussie, highlights another issue: the repeated interference from the Kenyan Cycling Federation. \u201cWe sent the team down to Tanzania and we spent two months training full-time for the Commonwealth Games,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then the Federation ordered us back and we spent three days with no bikes, doing nothing, in a busy town, with the federation yelling at them about this, this and this. Such behaviour is typical.\u201d Little wonder, then, the team are considering setting up a satellite camp in Tanzania, where the competition for top athletes is not so fierce and the federation will not be in their way so much. Leong has not given up guiding the team into the highest level of professional cycling. He travels back and forth from Africa to Asia, seeking sponsors. As things stand, the team have 15 full-time professional riders, earning anything from 15-25,000 Kenyan shillings per month (\u00a3110-180), but the cost of running the team \u2013 more than \u00a3100,000 a year \u2013 is not cheap. \u201cWe want to get a team into the Tour de France,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 10 years, this will happen and people will think it\u2019s the most wonderful thing in the world. There\u2019s real talent here in East Africa. We\u2019ve just looking for all the stars to align.\u201d Samwel Mwangi, the team\u2019s captain, says Njoroge\u2019s memory will spur them on in the years ahead. \u201cEvery time I wash my bike I feel like he is still with me,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause we did everything together. It\u2019s sad to think that we will never see him again. But his spirit will never leave us.\u201d"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/dec/13/small-business-spotlight-firefly", "sentences": ["Simon: We took on our first international client, in Singapore, a couple of years ago."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-13T08:00:04Z", "title": "Small business in the spotlight ... Firefly", "tags": ["Guardian Small Business Network", "Business", "Small business"], "article": "You started Firefly when you were studying for your GCSEs. Where did the idea come from? Simon: We were fed up with not being able to access school materials online because only the really technical teachers were able to put things up. The idea was to make something that would make sharing materials easy for our teachers. It wasn\u2019t really intended as a business, but to solve a problem. The internet was taking off around 1999 and a huge amount of stuff was available online, but not very much school-related material. Joe: It was something we were both interested in and our teachers were very supportive. Clearly we couldn\u2019t have done it without their encouragement and their ability to make sense of a crazy student idea.  What made you decide to turn the learning platform into a business?  Joe: Very early on we started to get pulled out of lessons by teachers to help them understand the software \u2013 that\u2019s when we knew it had taken off. We made the platform over the school holidays really and very soon on started to use it very heavily. While we were finishing school we sold the software to our first couple of other schools. We were going in aged 16 and talking to headmasters about why they should be using it.  We both went on to university and essentially through uni ran it as a part-time business. We were able to continue supporting our own school and continued to develop it alongside our studies.  Simon: We realised sharing materials wasn\u2019t just something that impacted our school \u2013 it was something that affected lots of schools in London and the UK and in many cities over the world.  Was it difficult to get people to take you seriously at such a young age?  Joe: If you had a product that people thought was interesting and useful then they would take you remarkably seriously even if you\u2019re just 16. The majority of schools we went out and pitched to were really interested in seeing what we were doing.  What\u2019s been the biggest challenge for the business?  Joe: The biggest challenge for us has been maintaining the growth. Each year we have to plan how to run a much larger company. Putting a management team in place as the company structure grows, coming up with more and more ambitious marketing techniques... nobody is doing the same thing they were a year ago.  Simon: We are still small but are growing quite quickly. That\u2019s very exciting but brings its own own challenges. How have you managed your expansion abroad?  Simon: We took on our first international client, in Singapore, a couple of years ago. We have been growing since then, primarily through word of mouth \u2013 I think it is very powerful that schools are prepared to do your marketing for you. We have now signed up schools in about 15 different countries. Expanding abroad is something people don\u2019t think about early on, it seems wildly presumptuous but actually the way you structure your business makes quite a big difference. We have been very keen to build a deliberately global business.  What do you think the future of teaching looks like?  Simon: You see a lot of scare stories about teachers being replaced by robots but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s all that likely. We want to support students and teachers and make things more efficient, fun and effective for them. What do you look for in new team members? Joe: The success of our business has been largely driven by the people that we hire. We are definitely looking for people who are flexible problem solvers who can learn very quickly. We have quite a lot of former teachers on the team now, which is great. What\u2019s your plan for the future?  Joe: Our plan is to keep on doubling in size, which will mean we reach 1,000 schools in a couple of years\u2019 time. We think that\u2019s doable, and it will involve more international travel.  Joe Mathewson, 29, and Simon Hay, 28, are the founders of Firefly.

The swimming pool no longer exists. But the five-star Claridge hotel on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es has restored the 110 rooms and suites above, where glitterati such as Edith Piaf, Coco Chanel and Marlene Dietrich once stayed, to celebrate its centenary. The Claridge, the model for Georges Simenon\u2019s Hotel Majestic in his Maigret books, remained open during its latest refurbishment, which took place one floor at a time. It is not alone in its revamp, as other so-called \u201cpalaces\u201d of Paris carry out major renovations to fight off a challenge from big Asian hospitality groups. The exclusive Crillon hotel, now owned by a Saudi prince, has a similarly colourful history, having been frequented in the past by not only Marie Antoinette but also Jacqueline Onassis, Orson Welles and Elizabeth Taylor. During the Nazi occupation the hotel \u2013 built in 1758 and one of the oldest in the world \u2013 housed the offices of the military governor of Paris. The Crillon has also closed for renovations and is expected to reopen next year. The Ritz hotel, owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, has also shut for a \u20ac140m (\u00a3111m) revamp that will include a removable glass roof over the restaurant. Fayed\u2019s son Dodi and Princess Diana were staying at the hotel when they set out on their last fateful car journey. The Parisian hotels received a wake-up call in 2010 after the French tourist ministry decided to award a new category of \u201cpalaces\u201d to five-star hotels with exceptional hospitality. To general surprise the Ritz and the exclusive George V hotel, located by the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, failed to make the original list. The George V is on the current list of palaces, which includes eight in Paris out of a total 16. However, of the eight, three are operated by Asian groups: the Hotel Royal Monceau-Raffles, which offers 3,767 sq ft presidential suites, the Mandarin Oriental, and the Shangri-La. Gwenola Donet of Jones Lang Lasalle hotels and hospitality group said that the competition from the Asian groups, which could start with a blank slate when creating their ultra-luxury hotels, was the principal reason for the rush to renovate by the historic top-end hotels. The Fraser Suites Le Claridge, now operated by the Singapore-based serviced apartment operator Frasers Hospitality, turned to French designer Pascal Allaman for the facelift. He says he was inspired by the \u201caesthetic vocabulary\u201d of the grand buildings in the swanky neighbourhood and says he wanted to recreate \u201cthe world of the great haute couture establishments\u201d nearby. The hotel\u2019s long corridors resemble a catwalk, their carpets striped in the signature colours of Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. The rooms have Chanel\u2019s beige draughtboard motif on the carpet and some walls are painted in the deep blue favoured by Saint Laurent. Some of the suites boast the original marble bathroom floors, marked with the famous name. Others have turquoise mosaics from the 1940s. The hotel, which opened in 1914, was used as a wartime hospital before returning to its original purpose. A plaque on the door of suite 102 bears the names of actors Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich, who had a passionate affair after the second world war. Dietrich joined Gabin in the hotel, where he stayed after being demobbed in July 1945. The writer Colette lived in the hotel for several years. But the relentless competition from Asia continues to challenge Paris\u2019s traditional hotels. The Peninsula hotels group of Hong Kong opened its first hotel in the French capital in August. Donet played down suggestions of oversupply once the \u201cpalaces\u201d \u2013 which charge from \u20ac800 (\u00a3635) per room \u2013 are all back on the market in 2016, providing a total of up to 1,800 rooms. \u201cIn the mid-term they\u2019ll be able to absorb the demand,\u201d she said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/dec/17/meet-the-childrens-books-site-members-groups", "sentences": ["louth323texel\u2019s contributions: LovetoRead Location:Singapore Reading age: 11 - 12 Favourite authors: Roald Dahl, Veronica Roth and Suzanne Collins Description:  We are avid readers and read at the start of every lesson."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-17T14:03:15Z", "title": "Meet the children's books site members: Groups, A-L", "tags": ["Children and teenagers", "Children's books: 7 and under", "Children's books: 8-12 years", "Teen books", "Books", "Culture", "Children's reading group resources"], "article": "4GKuwait Location: Kuwait, Jabriya  Reading age: 8 - 10  Favourite authors: Roald Dahl, Michael Morpurgo Description:  This Group is my wonderful class who love to read and be read to.

The latest figures from HMRC show that as of September UK cheese exports have risen by 8.2%. Cheese production for 2014 will be in the region of 400,000 tonnes, with about 130,000 tonnes exported. \u201cExports have been gradually increasing over the years and, in part, that\u2019s due to increased milk production,\u201d says Nigel White, head of trade body the British Cheese Board. \u201cThe bulk of these exports are commercial cheeses, which are sold to businesses. But while premium exports such as mature cheddars, Stilton and speciality cheeses form a minority, they produce very good returns.\u201d \u201cThe UK has had a chequered past with cheese making,\u201d says White. A lack of milk during the inter-war and post-war periods meant the UK was heavily dependent on imports. From the 1930s, the government controlled production and supply to ensure the masses had a decent diet. Dairy farms, which had to sell their production to the Milk Marketing Board, struggled to create their own cheeses. \u201cWe\u2019ve never produced enough milk in this country. Ever since the repeal of the Corn Laws, UK farms have had to compete with world prices when nearly every other country has quotas,\u201d says White. Many of the UK\u2019s burgeoning artisan cheese makers are creating products based on centuries old recipes. The domestic market, however, is dominated by big supermarkets and massive food companies competing on price, and is not an easy place for small and medium sized businesses to operate. In order to protect their bottom lines, cheese makers and creameries are therefore turning to exports. \u201cExports are also a response to a very competitive domestic market, it\u2019s a tough one to operate in,\u201d says White. \u201cThe supermarkets are very powerful and so margins have been squeezed. Small makers have gone to a lot of trouble to export as they see it as a way to offset the risk.\u201d The Bath Soft Cheese Company, set up in the 1993, is a traditional maker who is now looking abroad. Its Bath Cheese is based on a recipe which has been around since the 1790s and was even a favourite of Lord Nelson. Owner Hugh Padfield, who has 13 employees, says his \u00a31.1m business makes about 50 tonnes of cheese per year. Although the company only exports about a tonne of this, Padfield sees exports as key to growth. \u201cWe have expanded in the past five years. Once you\u2019ve got to the point where you have supplied all your local shops and delis it becomes quite difficult to expand in the UK. During the next year, we want to increase our production and sell more through exports. We are hoping exports will become around 10-20% of our sales.\u201d Even larger independents are finding it tough in the UK. Rich Clothier, managing director at family-owned Wyke Farms, employs 200 staff at his \u00a365m business. Even so, Clothier says they are a \u201cminnow\u201d compared to other suppliers. \u201cIn relative terms, we are a small business,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for us to get the retail space and it\u2019s tough for independent businesses to fight against the financial muscle of the big European businesses.\u201d Part of the company\u2019s business strategy has therefore been to diversify its sales market, a strategy which is having a powerful effect. During its last financial year, export sales were \u00a34.3m, but the run rate for the current year suggest sales of around \u00a310m. One of the main drivers of this growth is that Wyke\u2019s vintage mature cheddar has found favour across the channel with our cheese loving neighbours, the French. Wykes now has a listing with Carrefour, France\u2019s biggest supermarket, and Clothier has personally spent a lot of time in the country conducting tastings with consumers. \u201cIn the past, the French have turned their noses up at English food, but that\u2019s changing. They appreciate mature English cheddar and understand how it works with wine,\u201d says Clothier. \u201cCarrefour is our biggest export listing to date and we are enormously proud of it.\u201d This trend extends beyond Europe, with English cheese now finding favour across the world. The North American market is strong, although it is protected by quotas and different regulations.  Catherine Meade, owner of Lynher Dairies, has maintained a good line of business with the US for the past decade. The 30-strong business produces Yarg cheese, a unique Cornish product made from the milk of Friesian Cows, is wrapped in nettles and garlic leaves to mature. Meade says demand for her product is so strong overseas, she\u2019s unable to match it with supply. \u201cWe\u2019ve been exporting Cornish Yarg for ten years now and demand for the product continues to grow year on year. It remains a challenge for the dairy, but we recognise the huge potential of the export market and so seek to meet the demand as best we can,\u201d she says. \u201cOur core export market is the States, but we also have interest in Australia. We sell a certain amount to Europe and we are seeking to develop this market because the speed with which we can get the product to Europe is good for us, and for the cheese.\u201d The Wensleydale Creamery, based in Yorkshire, is also well-established in the US, its biggest market. Exports make up about 15% of the company\u2019s \u00a325m annual turnover, but recently it signed deals with 18 different buyers in Singapore and Kuwait and has more Asian deals in the pipeline. Export manager Janette Scarth says the business has hired two more people to work solely on overseas trade and expects more deals soon. \u201cIn the last 12 months, we\u2019ve focused on exports as a strategy for the business. We recently returned from China, where we got a great reaction.\u201d Other cheese makers have also noted the growing taste for British cheese in parts of the world not usually associated with dairy. Padfield says as his business expands, he hopes to take advantage of this. \u201cDeveloping nations that haven\u2019t got into dairy in the past are getting more into it now,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are very interested in the provenance. The UK is seen as old, traditional and high quality, so it\u2019s a natural place to go for cheese.\u201d Read more stories like this: Exporting advice for small businesses The British breweries taking over the world  Cultural complexity: the etiquette of doing business abroad Manufacturers power West Midlands\u2019 export success Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/dec/19/clive-palmer-adviser-andrew-crook-detained-over-raids", "sentences": ["Police had heard claims that Crook and Smith lured the witness to Batam island, near Singapore, on the pretence of a possible job offer from Palmer."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-19T00:20:37Z", "title": "Clive Palmer adviser Andrew Crook detained over raids linked to alleged kidnap", "tags": ["Clive Palmer", "Australian politics", "Australia news"], "article": "Clive Palmer\u2019s senior adviser, Andrew Crook, has been detained by police in an investigation apparently linked to an alleged kidnapping of a bank executive. Palmer confirmed the raid on the Crook Media office in Brisbane, telling Guardian Australia he was initially concerned it had something to do with the Palmer United party\u2019s Queensland state election campaign. Police have confirmed the raid was linked to the alleged kidnapping of an National Australia Bank executive in January 2013. \u201c[Queensland premier Campbell] Newman\u2019s police raided his office this morning under a search warrant, I went around to the office but was refused access,\u201d Palmer said. A staff member from Crook\u2019s office rang Palmer to inform him of the raid because the CBD office holds information relating to PUP. Crook, 48, was arrested by Queensland police during a raid on his home in Brisbane on Friday. He was then taken to his office. Queensland police said Taskforce Maxima\u2019s criminal economy team had uncovered evidence resulting in the arrest of two men and the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of a third man. They had been investigating a separate matter at the time. They said the people arrested were a 51-year-old man from the Gold Coast and 48-year-old man from New Farm. The third man, aged 48, is not in Australia. Police said they were investigating Crook over an alleged attempt to coerce a witness in a civil case against property developer and former Sydney Swans AFL player Tony Smith. Police had heard claims that Crook and Smith lured the witness to Batam island, near Singapore, on the pretence of a possible job offer from Palmer. Palmer told Fairfax Radio on Friday he knew nothing of the allegations against Crook. \u201cA search warrant doesn\u2019t mean anything. There\u2019s no charge against Mr Crook, he hasn\u2019t been arrested for anything. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s facing.

What Brehm\u2019s cooking does share with Blumenthal\u2019s is wit and technique. My favourite dishes are the cauliflower gratin, the vegetable \u201csalad\u201d, the Norweigian scallops served with borlotti beans, kalix caviar and cocoa, and Brehm\u2019s satay sauce marinated foie gras.

The jury remains out on whether it will find a permanent place in the sporting calendar, with athletics and swimming in particular reserving judgment. For this first edition, athletics will be a third-tier event and swimming a junior competition. But the standard in some sports is likely to be close to world-class and organisers hope innovative new events such as three-on-three basketball and beach football will attract the interest of television viewers. Euro 2020 Azerbaijan\u2019s biggest sporting coup was capturing four matches (three group games and a quarter\u2011final) in Michel Platini\u2019s grand plan to spread the European Championship across the continent in 2020. The imposing new 68,000-capacity national stadium, being hastily assembled at a cost of \u00a3453m and bankrolled by the state oil company, will be ready well before the tournament and was a big factor in swinging the vote. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid When Diego Costa and company stormed to a surprise La Liga title last season, they did so in shirts bearing the legend: \u201cAzerbaijan: Land of Fire\u201d. That was the first exposure many football fans had to the oil-rich state on the banks of the Caspian Sea. The Azerbaijan FA\u2019s general secretary, Elkhan Mammadov, who said the \u20ac12m season-and-a-half sponsorship scheme was bankrolled by a patriotic private businessman, thinks it has been a powerful tool in raising the profile of the country among ordinary fans. Socar Uefa sponsorship Just as the visibility around Europe of Gazprom, Russia\u2019s gas giant, soared thanks to its Champions League sponsorship deal, so Azerbaijan\u2019s state-owned oil company hopes to boost its brand with the biggest national team sponsorship deal Uefa has signed. It is one of the first agreed under a new model where headline sponsorship of Euro 2016 is bundled in with perimeter board signage from 32 of its federations. Socar is understood to be paying around \u20ac80m across four years for the deal. Formula One Just the latest example of Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s drive to tilt the F1 map towards countries prepared to pay handsomely for the privilege of using the sport to put their countries in the shop window, the first Baku Grand Prix will take place in 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t think many governments use [F1] enough,\u201d Ecclestone said in a revealing interview recently. We open the eyes of the world and they don\u2019t see it or use it. I mean, who had ever heard of Bahrain before we went there?\u201d The street circuit will be designed by Hermann Tilke, responsible for the Abu Dhabi and Singapore tracks, and will showcase the rapid development along the bay in Baku as well as other landmarks. The race is expected to be called the Formula One Grand Prix of Europe. Uefa\u2019s 2016 Under-17 Championship Hosting age-specific championships is seen as an important stepping stone towards securing their senior brethren and building links within Uefa. Agreeing to host the 16-team tournament in May 2016 undoubtedly helped when it came to winning four Euro 2020 matches. Azerbaijan will qualify automatically as hosts. 2013 Women\u2019s Under-17 World Cup Mammadov said hosting the women\u2019s tournament had shown the country could deliver. He said it also helped boost women\u2019s football in Azerbaijan and change attitudes in the country. \u201cWhen we introduced women\u2019s football development in 2010 we were criticised by some parts of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in one year\u2019s time, when we had created the opportunity for women to play football, we started in 2011 with 25 registered female players. Now we have more than 5,000 girls playing football.\u201d 2014 Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships The event, featuring gymnasts from 30 nations, took place in May in the newly opened National Gymnastics Arena. There was a diplomatic row when it was claimed that the organisers forced Belarus to drop music written by an Armenian composer. The Azerbaijanis said the claim was not true and was Armenian propaganda. Baku Cup The first professional tennis tournament to be held in Azerbaijan was inaugurated in 2011. The annual WTA tour event has been won by Elina Svitolina for the past two years. Olympic Games Baku failed at the shortlisting stage in its ambitious bid to stage the 2020 Olympics, being cut from the longlist along with Doha. Mammadov, who was a member of the bid team, said the experience would stand them in good stead if they tried again for 2024 or 2028. \u201cBy bidding, you increase your experience and build a network. You are building a foundation for future bidding processes,\u201d he said. He believes huge investment in venues for the European Games and Euro 2020 could help its cause in a bidding environment where the IOC is likely prioritise low-cost, low-risk bids."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/dec/22/christmas-on-campus-international-students", "sentences": ["Jose Hong, 23, a UCL student originally from Singapore and currently on his year abroad, will spend his third Christmas away from home \u2013 this time in Sweden after two in the UK."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-22T11:16:18Z", "title": "Christmas on campus: what are international students up to this year?", "tags": ["Students", "International students", "Education", "Higher education", "Advice for students", "Studying abroad", "Christmas"], "article": "A flight from London to Malaysia can cost over a grand \u2013 one reason why Tai Jei See, 21, an international student at the University of Southampton, will be spending her first Christmas in the UK this year. \u201cI feel sad and get more homesick during festive seasons \u2013 especially during Christmas,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it\u2019s easier to cope when I have friends to spend the holidays with and a lot of work to keep me occupied.\u201d She plans to cook dinner with them and go to church. Florence Lee, 21, a student from Hong Kong at the University of Cambridge, has also spent her Christmases in the UK. \u201cI\u2019d rather spend money on food and books than an uncomfortable, long-haul flight,\u201d she says. For Lee, Christmas day in London might involve a stroll around Hyde Park, dim sum in Chinatown and a traditional Christmas dinner in the evening with friends. The journey home is also too far and too expensive for Al-Hussein Abutaleb, 33, a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, originally from Yemen, who will be spending his sixth Christmas away from home. He doesn\u2019t usually celebrate it, so he\u2019ll spend his time off eating cheese and watching TV. Jose Hong, 23, a UCL student originally from Singapore and currently on his year abroad, will spend his third Christmas away from home \u2013 this time in Sweden after two in the UK. \u201cI came to the UK to learn more about different cultures, and on the continent Christmas has great historical significance. \u201cI want to experience it as local people do, which is what I did last year when I went up to the Midlands with a friend,\u201d says Hong. This year he\u2019ll be learning about Scandinavian traditions from a host family.     Jose Hong celebrating Christmas last year at his friend\u2019s house in the Midlands. Photograph: Jose Hong    Getting an authentic taste of how different cultures celebrate Christmas is what many international students want most, and Host UK has been linking them to unpaid hosts, with whom they can spend Christmas day, for 27 years. Kimberley Brough, Host\u2019s student programme manager, says the scheme offers them opportunities they wouldn\u2019t have if they spent Christmas with other international students. \u201cChristmas with one of our hosts gives them the chance to try something that\u2019s usually a completely new experience.\u201d Hosts sometimes leave decorating the tree until the last minute so students can help, and Christmas crackers are always a big hit, says Brough. It\u2019s often the first time students have had British home-cooked food. \u201cOne Christmas, a student was offered a gravy boat and, not knowing what it was for, poured it into his drinking glass, which gave everyone, including the student, a good laugh.\u201d But for international students who want to do their own thing, many universities have a lot to offer over Christmas. Since 2011, Durham University has hosted a Christmas lunch for them in Durham Castle\u2019s Great Hall, and 250 students are expected to attend this year. Diners can choose between roast turkey breast, bacon rolls and chipolata sausages, and a wild rice, spinach, pine nut and portobello mushroom wellington. Lei Wang, 22, a master\u2019s student at Durham, attended last year\u2019s lunch and says the historical architecture provided the perfect atmosphere in which to spend Christmas, which isn\u2019t a national holiday in his home country of China. \u201cI used to celebrate it mainly at school because we didn\u2019t have days off. We might give cards and gifts to classmates, but that was it,\u201d says Wang. During his four past Christmases spent in the UK, he has spent time with friends\u2019 families in the UK: \u201cThis is the best way, so I get to see how it\u2019s really celebrated, like how happy little kids are to receive presents from Santa.\u201d To help international students get a feel of a real British Christmas, staff at the University of Sheffield will accompany them to services at Sheffield Cathedral on Christmas eve and day. And in the run-up to the big day, Sheffield is holding activities including games and craft evenings, bowling, ice skating and museum visits. Loneliness can be an issue for students staying on campus, so the University of Southampton will be hosting social events \u2013 including a Christmas day tea with food, board games and party games, and film screenings on Boxing Day. \u201cThe multicultural atmosphere is great and those who come along enjoy the fun of celebrating a family Christmas, however far they are from home,\u201d says a university spokesperson. On Christmas eve, the University of Sussex is hosting a free Christmas lunch and will open its Meeting House on Christmas day for students to celebrate together. Newcastle and Northumbria universities are collaborating for a third year to host a range of festive activities, including visits to the Christmas market at the Beamish Museum, a Newcastle United home game and a pantomime. There will also be a treasure hunt around the city and a free lunch on Christmas Day at St Luke\u2019s Church, Newcastle. Students at the University of Birmingham can also take a trip to the city\u2019s renowned German Christmas market for a less than traditional British Christmas experience.

Search and rescue operations are under way after flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320-200 that departed from the Indonesian city of Surabaya, went missing.  The flight lost communication with Jakarta\u2019s air traffic control at 7.24am Singapore time (2324 GMT Saturday) about an hour before it was scheduled to land in Singapore, the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement.  The contact was lost about 42 minutes after the single-aisle jetliner took off from Indonesia\u2019s Surabaya airport, Hadi Mustofa, an official of the transportation ministry told Indonesia\u2019s MetroTV.  The plane had six crew and 155 passengers, including 16 children and one infant, according to the general manager of Surabaya\u2019s Juanda airport, Trikora Raharjo.  He said there were six foreigners: three South Koreans including an infant and one each from Singapore, Britain and Malaysia. The rest were Indonesians, he said. AirAsia, on the other hand, said in a statement there were seven crew and that there were no Britons on board. The plane lost contact when it was believed to be over the Java Sea between Kalimantan and Java islands, Mustofa said. He said the weather in the area was cloudy.  The Singapore statement said search and rescue operations had been activated by the Indonesian authorities. It said the Singapore air force and the navy also were searching with two C-130 planes.  Flightradar24, a flight tracking website, said the plane was delivered in September 2008, which would make it six years old. It said the plane was flying at 32,000ft (9,700 meters), the regular cruising altitude for most jetliners, when the signal from the plane was lost. The Malaysia-based AirAsia, which has dominated cheap travel in the region for years, has never lost a plane before.  This is the third major air incident for south-east Asia this year. On 8 March, Malaysia Airlines flight 370, a wide-bodied Boeing 777, went missing soon after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing. It remains missing until this day with 239 people in one of the biggest aviation mysteries.  Another Malaysia Airlines flight, also a Boeing 777, was shot down over rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine while on a flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on 17 July.

The Airbus boss had been expecting a call to his office in Toulouse. It was Tim Clark, chief executive of Dubai-based airline Emirates, the biggest buyer of the planemaker\u2019s A380 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d. Clark was angry. He wanted to know why Airbus finance director Harald Wilhelm had just raised the prospect of the death of the A380. The aircraft cost $25bn (\u00a316bn) to develop, but it has struggled to chalk up the large orders Airbus had envisioned, at $440m each. So far, it has just 318 orders, compared with the 1,200 that Airbus thought airlines needed in that size category \u2013 it carries around 550 passengers \u2013 when it began marketing in 2000. Wilhelm sparked panic among Airbus customers and shareholders when he told analysts it would break even on the aircraft up until 2018, \u201cif we would do something on the product, or even if we would discontinue the product\u201d. The indiscretion let slip an internal debate at Airbus about the future of the world\u2019s largest jetliner. However, it was the first time the Franco-German manufacturer had publicly admitted it was contemplating pulling the rug on the programme. \u201cI am not particularly happy, as you can imagine,\u201d Clark fumed. \u201cWe are on the hook for this plane. I get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake.\u201d Emirates has 55 of the giant planes in service and has placed orders for a further 85. The carrier accounts for 40% of the total orders for the aircraft, so any squeak from Clark will reverberate around Toulouse. Airbus has attempted to soothe fears about killing off its marquee plane by saying it was more likely to modify the aircraft and launch a model with more fuel-efficient engines, known as the A380Neo (new engine option), or a bigger \u201cstretch\u201d version. \u201cThe entire Airbus top management continues to believe strongly in the market prospects for the A380, but any investment requires a sound business case, which we will continue to study.\u201d Clark said if Airbus did press ahead with the engine upgrade, which could improve fuel efficiency by up to 15%, Emirates would eventually replace all 140 of its superjumbos with the upgraded version. Since the plane\u2019s first commercial flight with Singapore Airlines in 2007, Airbus has struggled to sell the A380. The global economic downturn hit airlines hard, forcing many out of business. Those that survived have turned to using smaller, twin-jet models that are more fuel efficient and can fly to more airports. One industry source said: \u201cWe still haven\u2019t come out of recession and for companies to put major assets like this on the balance sheet is a big ask.\u201d The A380 works best when flown on popular routes, or from capacity-constrained airports, such as Heathrow. But many airlines have struggled to make the investment profitable. Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of Air France-KLM, aims to cancel the last two of a dozen A380s the airline has on order and swap them for smaller models. He said recently: \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent plane but it only works for the right destinations.\u201d This year looks like it will be the first since the A380 entered service without a new airline customer. The only buyer has been a leasing company that has yet to line up a single carrier to take any of the 20 planes it ordered. James Hogan, chief executive of Etihad, this month ruled out further A380 purchases as he took delivery of the airline\u2019s first \u201csuperjumbo\u201d. His frank assessment that Etihad would not be affected by the ending of A380 production added weight to fears that Airbus has struggled to find any more buyers. Hogan said: \u201cWhen you are taking 10 aircraft, whether Airbus continues the production line or not isn\u2019t an issue.\u201d Airbus is suing Japan\u2019s Skymark Airlines after cancelling an order for six A380s amid fears that it would not receive payment from the airline, while Virgin Atlantic and Air Austral are among the carriers increasingly unlikely to proceed with orders. Clark is baffled by the way rival airlines use the A380, noting the odd seating configurations that some use. Emirates is using the plane as its main jet because air travel is forecast to double in the next 10 years to 7bn passengers annually. So it is convinced that airports and airlines will need huge jets like the A380 to cope with the surge in demand. \u201cIt\u2019s a great aircraft,\u201d Clark told Airlineratings.com. \u201cIf airlines don\u2019t believe they can fill an A380, their business model is wrong.\u201d He said if a new model was built it would be as economical to fly as the Boeing 777X long-haul jet, which is being introduced in 2018. \u201cWe will buy 140 of the A380Neos,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I am around, I am going to continue to fight the battle for the A380. The world needs [this aircraft].\u201d He described the plane as a \u201cpassenger magnet\u201d and reckons the five that Emirates operates each day between Dubai and Heathrow are 95% full. While the Dubai carrier is loath to see the A380 cancelled, perhaps even more is at stake for Britain\u2019s economy. Any move to kill off the \u201cqueen of the skies\u201d is sure to cause anguish at Airbus\u2019s two main British plants. All of the wings for its planes are designed in Filton, Bristol, and assembled at Broughton in north Wales. Broughton\u2019s new north factory is one of the biggest in Britain and contains a huge, automated rivet gun which is five storeys high. It takes this giant industrial stapler 10 days to punch 750,000 rivets into precise locations on both wings. It would take more than a month for two teams of 20 people on each wing to do the same job. The wings are the most complicated and most important part of the plane and there are thousands of well-paid, highly skilled British jobs that rely on the work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot hanging on the future of this programme for Britain,\u201d an industry source said. However, insiders suggested that Wilhelm\u2019s gaffe and Clark\u2019s angry response had refocused Airbus\u2019s top team on sorting out the A380, which may give the programme a shot in the arm. The Emirates chief urged the manufacturer to step up its A380 marketing efforts. He also criticised Airbus for focusing too heavily on an upgrade of its best-selling A320 short-haul plane. \u201cWhat is happening over there?\u201d he fumed. \u201cI would like a first-hand understanding on where it is going.\u201d Whatever Airbus decides, some believe the A380 is already destined for the history books. Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst at Teal Group and a long-time critic of the giant jetliner, said the fresh crop of wide bodied, twin-engine planes coming to the market signalled the death of the A380. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will last for more than a few years into the next decade,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cThe quicker Airbus lets go, the quicker it can devote its marketing efforts to other products.\u201d A380 FACTFILE \u25a0 The Airbus A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. \u25a0 It is the world\u2019s biggest jetliner at 73m long, 24.45m high and with a wingspan of almost 80m. \u25a0 Each of the A380\u2019s giant wings, which are designed and made in Britain, can hold up to 125 tonnes of fuel. This gives it a flight range of 15,700 km, or enough juice to fly non-stop from Dallas to Sydney. \u25a0It takes 3,600 litres of paint to cover the 3,100 sq m (33,000 sq ft) exterior of the aircraft. \u25a0There is 530km of wiring in each A380 aircraft."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/airasia-flight-qz8501-bishop-says-no-australians-aboard-as-military-help-search", "sentences": ["Other countries, including Singapore, Malaysia and India, have offered to assist the search effort."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-29T01:05:16Z", "title": "AirAsia flight QZ8501: Bishop says no Australians aboard as military help search", "tags": ["AirAsia flight QZ8501", "Australia news", "Indonesia", "Singapore", "Asia Pacific", "Air transport", "Australian politics", "Julie Bishop", "Australian defence force"], "article": "No Australians were on the AirAsia flight carrying 162 people that went missing over the Java sea on Sunday, the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has confirmed. \u201cAt this stage, I can confirm that there are no Australians on board,\u201d Bishop said on Monday morning. \u201cWe are waiting for details of the [flight] manifest to determine whether there are any other linkages to Australia, [either] permanent residents or dual nationals,\u201d she said.

However, airlines can no longer claim technical faults as extraordinary circumstances, following a court ruling in November. Passengers bumped off flights are due the same compensation as those who are delayed, which is as follows: \u2022 for flights of less than 1,500km (932 miles) passengers can claim \u20ac250 (\u00a3198) \u2022 for 1,500km-3,500km, or flights within the EU of more than 1,500km, a three-hour delay entitles you to \u20ac200.

In each case passengers get the larger sum if they are denied boarding because the flight was full or cancelled. If you are delayed your airline should give you a leaflet outlining your rights and how to claim compensation. However, even when a legitimate claim is made airlines have an unfortunate habit of turning them down. Passengers can take their case to the Civil Aviation Authority but it is having to tackle huge volumes of complaints. The Which? report also looked at the average delays from nine airlines (the largest eight in the UK and Ryanair) flying to 10 UK airports. Thomas Cook and Monarch were the only two airlines that failed to meet the industry standard of \u201con time\u201d, which is defined as early to 15 minutes late. The two had average delays of 17 to 18 minutes. Flybe was the least delayed on average, followed by Ryanair. In an additional survey based on the experiences of 11,396 Which? members flying economy, Swiss was voted the best short-haul airline with a customer score of 82% while Thomas Cook came last with a score of 38%.

The fate of the flight\u2019s 155 passengers and seven crew members is now uncertain: at 6.17am, about 40 minutes after takeoff, the flight vanished from radars over the Java Sea. No signs of the plane have been found, despite an elaborate international search and rescue operation. The hope of finding survivors is fading.

But the confirmation came in a particularly brutal way: live television coverage showed a half-naked, bloated body floating in the sea. Many people began crying hysterically. Several fainted and had to be carried out of the room at Surabaya\u2019s airport, the starting point for the ill-fated AirAsia Indonesia flight QZ8501 that departed early on Sunday morning. \u201cYou have to be strong,\u201d said the mayor of Surabaya, Tri Rismaharini, as she comforted relatives. \u201cThey are not ours, they belong to God.\u201d But one woman, dressed in an AirAsia uniform, raged at the TV. \u201cIs it possible for you not to show a picture of the dead?\u201d she shouted. \u201cPlease do not show a picture of a dead body.\u201d A man awaiting news of his younger brother said the relatives had been calm before the broadcast of the grisly images, shot from a search helicopter, showing a body floating face down, clad only in underwear and socks. \u201cBut the atmosphere was very different after the footage of a dead body was shown,\u201d said Munif, 50, who in common with many Indonesians uses one name. \u201cFamilies became hysterical.\u201d Dwijanto, 60, awaiting news of his son, told the AFP news agency that the images extinguished any hope for him. \u201cMy heart will be totally crushed if it\u2019s true. I will lose a son,\u201d he said. The channel involved, Indonesia\u2019s TVOne, apologised. However, the news the relatives had all feared was fast emerging nonetheless. After two days of fruitless searching for the Airbus A320-200, shortly after midday local time search planes spotted what appeared to be an aircraft door, an emergency slide and other debris in the water. It was six miles from where the airliner, carrying 162 passengers and crew from Indonesia\u2019s second city to Singapore, vanished shortly after requesting an altitude change to avoid a storm. Officials said the debris appeared to be red and white, the colours of AirAsia. Bambang Soelistyo, the head of Indonesia\u2019s national search and rescue agency, told a press conference that spotters had also seen what appeared to be a \u201cshadow\u201d on the relatively shallow seabed, possibly the main wreckage. As dusk fell over the search site the airline\u2019s parent company, Malaysia-based AirAsia released a statement saying Indonesian officials had formally confirmed that the debris came from flight QZ8501. By nightfall, search and recovery teams \u2013 which included around 30 ships and 15 aircraft from nine countries \u2013 had recovered a number of bodies, estimated at around 40, as well as more debris and some personal possessions, including a blue suitcase, unopened and undamaged. Tony Fernandes, the flamboyant Malaysian tycoon who founded AirAsia and is also chairman of Queens Park Rangers football club, said the news left him \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d. He met a number of the relatives at the airport to apologise personally and offer his condolences. \u201cThe passengers were on my aircraft and I have to take responsibility for that,\u201d Fernandes told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s an experience I never dreamt of happening and it\u2019s probably an airline CEO\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d It is the airline\u2019s first fatal incident, and on Tuesday another AirAsia plane made an emergency landing. Passengers on board a flight to Kalibo, in the Philippines, tweeted photos of the plane with its emergency chutes deployed after it apparently overshot the runway while landing in bad weather. Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, who visited the airport to meet the families and talk to Fernandes, said all efforts would be devoted to recovering the remaining bodies and the wreckage as quickly as possible. In a brief statement to the press he said the waters around the crash site appeared to be around 25 metres in depth, relatively easy for scuba divers to reach. The shallow seas \u2013 around 1% of the depths involved in the ongoing search off Australia for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which disappeared without trace in March \u2013 should make it more straightforward to locate the plane\u2019s black box flight recorders and thus, possibly, to discover why it crashed. Nonetheless, weather conditions were challenging, with navy officials saying waves were three metres high. Fernandes said the pilot, named in reports as Captain Iriyanto, was \u201cextremely experienced\u201d, with 20,000 hours of flying time. Fernandes appeared to blame the weather, saying: \u201cThere were some very unique weather conditions and let\u2019s wait for the investigation to be concluded.\u201d An Indonesian investigator, speaking to Reuters anonymously, said the inquiry was focusing on when the crew decided to ascend to avoid the bad weather. \u201cWe know that the weather was very bad in this area, there was a storm,\u201d the official said. \u201cWhy did he [the pilot] request to climb at that stage? Should he have climbed earlier? Other aircraft were flying at a higher altitude in that area. How did the two pilots react to the weather? We are asking those questions.\u201d In the meantime, the relatives of those on board, among them 18 children and infants, must wait to learn what happened, and hope their bodies can be recovered. Fernandes said the devastating news at least meant relatives were no longer holding out hope in vain. Some at Surabaya\u2019s airport agreed. Agus Panjaya, a 36-year-old businessman, had been awaiting news of his grandmother, and his aunt and uncle, as well as their three children. \u201cOf course we feel sad about our loved ones but we had prepared ourselves for the worst,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cBefore this everything was unclear.

Roeslani sold his 13.4% voting stake in Bumi in February 2013 for about \u00a390m. Bumi was founded in a $3bn deal when the powerful Bakrie family placed its coal assets into a cash shell formed by Rothschild. The two sides fell out amid accusations of financial irregularities \u2013 strongly denied by the family \u2013 and a whistleblower report, which the company alleged was based on hacked emails.

A navy spokesman said on Tuesday night that more than 40 bodies had been recovered, but on Wednesday said the figure was wrong and attributed the error to a \u201cmiscommunication\u201d. Indonesian authorities said 130 ambulances were ready to take bodies to hospital for identification. On Wednesday, the first two recovered bodies were put in coffins and flown to Surayaba, a major metropolis 400 miles south-east of Jakarta, where friends and relatives of those onboard have gathered to wait for updates. The relatives learned of the plane\u2019s fate while watching live television on Tuesday night, when Indonesia\u2019s TvOne broadcaster showed images of a partially clothed body floating in the water. Many of them reportedly burst into tears, AFP reported; at least one fainted, and one was carried out on a stretcher. The station quickly apologised for airing the images. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, travelled to Surayaba on Tuesday night to comfort the families. \u201cI pray for your strength in facing this tragedy,\u201d he said.

It is alleged that Smith, Featherstone and Crook plotted to induce a banker who testified in the case to change his testimony. Crook is accused of luring the banker, whom Guardian Australia has chosen not to name, to Singapore in January 2013, where the banker believed he would meet Palmer to discuss a job as his \u201cglobal finance manager with an exorbitant pay salary\u201d. Crook then took the banker to a villa on the nearby Indonesian island of Batam, according to the documents, where he introduced him to a supposed Palmer executive, \u201cMichael Wright\u201d \u2013 who was actually Featherstone. Police allege Featherstone conducted a bogus job interview in which he tried to extract a confession by telling the banker \u201cthat \u2018Clive\u2019 wanted to know if he was the type of person who would take one for the team and had he lied to protect the bank [in the court case]\u201d. When the banker insisted he had told the truth, Featherstone allegedly replied that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t sell that to Clive because Clive wanted someone who could show they are loyal\u201d. Police claim Featherstone has \u201clinks to organised crime on the Gold Coast and abroad\u201d, including bikies known to be part of crime networks that were \u201cextensive with vast resources and access to cash\u201d. Featherstone\u2019s arrest might have sparked concerns among a crime syndicate that was under investigation that it might be exposed, police allege. \u201cAs a result Featherstone may be provided an opportunity to flee, be concealed or be prevented in appearing in future court appearances for the protection of said crime networks,\u201d the documents state. The plot targeting the banker required \u201ca high degree of professional knowledge and commitment that is consistent with that of the police detective\u201d, police said. The banker\u2019s \u201cinterview\u201d with Featherstone was followed by what police claim was the conspirators\u2019 \u201cplan B\u201d to force a confession. They allege men in security uniforms came into the villa, strip-searched the banker and took his mobile phone, wallet and passport before Featherstone announced: \u201cThe big guy is here.\u201d Police claim the banker thought this was Palmer \u2013 but instead Smith entered and physically threatened him, saying Australian police \u201ccould not touch him\u201d in Indonesia. Smith said he \u201cowned\u201d Indonesian police and that he would be jailed unless Smith obtained a confession he could use to get money from NAB, the documents state. Police said the banker agreed \u201cin fear\u201d to confess in a video \u201cinterview\u201d with Featherstone, after which he was \u201creleased\u201d. Smith allegedly told Featherstone by email a week earlier: \u201cI just want to be really prepared in case Plan A does not work as I will not be leaving (and neither will [the banker]) until we have what you consider is 100% enough to turn the court case around or have [him] and his assistant charged with perjury or both.\u201d  Featherstone allegedly told Smith by email after the incident that if the banker went to authorities Australian police would be powerless to act. \u201cThe AFP or Q-pol have no jurisdiction concerning any alleged act in Indonesia and do not have the legal authority to hold anyone with respect to any allegation in that jurisdiction,\u201d he allegedly wrote. It is alleged that Featherstone briefed Crook on how to handle police if approached about the plot. Featherstone allegedly said Crook, as the banker\u2019s \u201clink to the chain of events\u201d, would be the first to be approached by police. \u201cI briefed crooka on what to do in the event that this occurred and he is cool,\u201d Featherstone allegedly said. The court documents state that NAB refused to negotiate when Smith\u2019s lawyers tried to seek a payout using the confession. Featherstone also tried unsuccessfully to use the confession to get other NAB staff to change their evidence, it is alleged. An assistant of the banker, who had also given evidence in the 2012 case, was earlier approached by a friend of Smith\u2019s then working at NAB, who discussed a possible payment if the assistant changed his evidence, police claim. Featherstone later used a false name to call the assistant and try to intimidate him into changing his evidence by reciting all the man\u2019s assets and \u201cpersonal particulars including his family\u201d, it is alleged. Police claim Smith then colluded with Featherstone and Crook to \u201cbait\u201d the banker with the bogus job opportunity with Palmer. There is no suggestion in the documents that Palmer knew anything about the alleged plot. Lawyers for Crook and Featherstone argued at their 19 December bail hearings in Brisbane that the documents should be suppressed in the interests of a fair trial. Magistrate Paul Kluck was unmoved but granted both men bail. Crook\u2019s solicitor Andrew McGinnes said there was no evidence his client, who was not present during the banker\u2019s discussion with Featherstone, knew anything about \u201cwhat was to be discussed at the meeting or how it was to be conducted\u201d. Featherstone\u2019s barrister Alastair McDougall told the court police were \u201cnotorious\u201d for presenting one-sided accounts in court documents knowing they would enter the public domain. Police did not include Featherstone\u2019s response to an email from Smith to indicate whether he agreed to be involved in \u201cplan B\u201d, McDougall said. Featherstone\u2019s solicitor Chris Hannay said his client would \u201cvigorously contest\u201d the charges. Smith remains in Indonesia, according to the police affidavit."}]}
