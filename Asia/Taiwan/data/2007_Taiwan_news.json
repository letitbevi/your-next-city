All China basked in the reflected glow; foreigners were barbarians beyond the gilded pale who should not be allowed even to learn the art of speaking and writing Chinese. When I first visited China in the autumn of 2003, such articles of Confucian faith seemed very far away, submerged by the lost wars and the 26 humiliating treaties of the 19th century, subsequent communist revolution and now the economic growth to which Beijing&apos;s motorway rings and Shanghai&apos;s skyline are tribute. This was a new China that had plainly left behind obeisance to the canons of Confucianism and the later cruelties of Mao. More than three years and a book later, I am less convinced. All societies are linked to their past by umbilical cords - some apparent, some hidden. China is no different. Imperial Confucian China and communist China alike depended - and depend - upon the notion of a vastly powerful, infallible centre: either because it was interpreting the will of heaven or, now, of the proletariat. In neither system have human rights, constitutional checks and balances or even forms of democracy figured very much. As a result, China has poor foundations on which to build the subtle network of institutions of accountability necessary to manage the complexities of a modern economy and society. Sooner or later, it is a failing that will have to be addressed. China is both very confident about its recent success and very insecure about its past, a potent mix that breeds a deep-seated xenophobia and shallow arrogance. China&apos;s economy in 2007 will be nearly nine times larger than it was in 1978 when Deng Xiaoping won the power struggle with the Maoists and began his extraordinarily sinuous, gradualist but successful programme of market-based economic reforms, groping for stones to cross the river, as he called it. China is now the fourth largest economy in the world - after the United States, Japan, and Germany - and is set to become the second largest within a decade. More than 150 million workers have moved to China&apos;s booming cities and 400 million people have been removed from poverty. It is a head-spinning achievement. China is the new factor in global politics and economics, and its rulers and people know it. It now has more than $1 trillion of foreign exchange reserves, the world&apos;s largest. It is the single most important financier of the United States&apos; enormous trade deficit. It is the world&apos;s second largest importer of oil. Before 2010, it will be the world&apos;s largest exporter of goods. It is, comfortably, the world&apos;s second largest military power. Last year, the Pentagon&apos;s four-yearly defence review stated that China is the power most likely to &apos;field disruptive military technologies that could over time offset traditional US military advantages&apos;. A new great power is in the making, but one whose pursuit of its self-interest takes the amorality of power to a new plane. It is not just the Chinese who should be concerned about its institutional and moral failings; all of us should be. In China, you can almost smell the new self-confidence: it is in the skyscrapers built in months; it is in the brash and unashamed willingness to rip off and copy Western brands; it is in the well-groomed and inscrutable demeanour of the rich entrepreneurs, self-confident officials and assured academics. I sat in a Beijing bar just over a year ago with a typical member of China&apos;s new class of rich businessmen who double up as members of the party, a combination of commercial and political power that China knew well as the old Confucian mandarinate, now strangely reproducing itself in a new guise after Mao tried to eliminate it forever in the Cultural Revolution. In surprisingly fluent English and with his Mercedes waiting outside, he praised China&apos;s communist regime and its curious mix of capitalism and communism with all the enthusiasm of a Tory businessmen praising Thatcher. Chinese corruption? Think of Enron and party-funding scandals in London, he declaimed. Double standards between communist rhetoric and practice? What about the US and Britain&apos;s invasion of Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay? What I failed to realise, he insisted, betraying both assurance and insecurity, is that China will not surrender again the natural rank that it should never have lost. Western values, institutions and attitudes were being revealed for being straw men, blown away by resurgent China and the pragmatism of its communist leaders. Yet Western values and institutions are not being blown away. The country has made progress to the extent that communism has given up ground and moved towards Western practices, but there are limits to how far the reformers can go without giving up the basis for the party&apos;s political control. Conservatives insist that much further and the capacity to control the country will become irretrievably damaged; that the limit, for example, is being reached in giving both trade unions more autonomy and shareholders more rights. It is the most urgent political debate in China. The tension between reform and conservatism is all around. For example, the party&apos;s commitment now is no longer to building a planned communist economy but a &apos;socialist market&apos; economy. The 26,000 communes in rural China, which were once the vanguard of communism, were swept away by the peasants themselves in just three years between 1979 and 1982, the largest bottom-up act of decollectivisation the world has ever witnessed. Hundreds of millions of peasants are, via long leases, again farming plots held by their ancestors for millenniums. China&apos;s state-owned enterprises no longer provide life-long employment and welfare for their workers as centrepieces of a new communist order; they are autonomous companies largely free to set prices as they choose in an open economy and progressively shedding their social obligations. Equally amazing, China&apos;s communists have declared that the class war is over. The party now claims to represent not just the worker and peasant masses but entrepreneurs and business leaders, whom it welcomes into its ranks. The party refers to this metamorphosis as the &apos;three represents&apos;: meaning that the party today represents &apos;advanced productive forces&apos; (capitalists); &apos;the overwhelming majority&apos; of the Chinese (not just workers and peasants); and &apos;the orientation ... of China&apos;s advanced culture&apos; (religious, political and philosophical traditions other than communism). Party representatives say that the country is no longer pledged to fight capitalism to the death internationally, but, instead, wants to rise peacefully. China has joined the World Trade Organisation and is a judicious member of the United Nations Security Council, using its veto largely in matters that immediately concern it, such as Taiwan. But for all that, it remains communist. The maxims of Marxist-Leninst-Maoist thought have to stand, however much the party tries to stretch the boundaries, because they are the basis for one-party rule. Yet the system so spawned is reaching its limits. For example, China&apos;s state-owned and directed banks cannot carry on channelling hundreds of billions of pounds of peasant savings into the financing of a frenzy of infrastructure and heavy industrial investment. The borrowers habitually pay interest only fitfully, and rarely repay the debt, even as the debt mountain explodes. The financial system is vulnerable to any economic setback. Equally, China is reaching the limits of the capacity to increase its exports, which, in 2007, will surpass $1 trillion, by 25 per cent a year. At this rate of growth, they will reach $5 trillion by 2020 or sooner, representing more than half of today&apos;s world trade. Is that likely? Are there ships and ports on sufficient scale to move such volumes - and will Western markets stay uncomplainingly open? Every year, it is also acquiring $200bn of foreign exchange reserves as it rigs its currency to keep its exports competitive. Can even China insulate its domestic financial system from such fantastic growth in its reserves and stop inflation rising? Already, there are ominous signs that inflationary pressures are increasing. These ills have communist roots. It is the lack of independent scrutiny and accountability that lie behind the massive waste of investment and China&apos;s destruction of its environment alike. The pace of desertification has doubled over 20 years, in a country where 25 per cent of the land area is already desert. Air pollution kills 400,000 people a year prematurely. A hacking cough in the Beijing smog or the stench when the wind comes from the north in Shanghai are reminders of just how far China still has to go. Energy is wasted on an epic scale. But the worst problem is water. One-fifth of China&apos;s 660 cities face extreme water shortages and as many as 90 per cent have problems of water pollution; 500 million rural Chinese still do not have access to safe drinking water. Illegal and rampant polluting, a severe shortage of sewage treatment facilities, and chemical pollutants together continue to degrade China&apos;s waterways. In autumn 2005, two major cities - Harbin and Guangzhou - had their water supplies cut off for days because their river sources had suffered acute chemical spills from state-owned factories. Enterprises are accountable to no one but the Communist party for their actions; there is no network of civil society, plural public institutions and independent media to create pressure for enterprises to become more environmentally efficient. Watchdogs, whistleblowers, independent judges and accountable government are not just good in themselves as custodians of justice; they also keep capitalism honest and efficient and would curb environmental costs that reach an amazing 12 per cent of GDP. As importantly, they are part of the institutional network that constitutes an independent public realm that includes free intellectual inquiry, free trade unions and independent audit. It is this &apos;enlightenment infrastructure&apos; that I regard in both the West and East as the essential underpinning of a healthy society. The individual detained for years without a fair trial is part of the same malign system that prevents a company from expecting to be able to correct a commercial wrong in a court, or have a judgment in its favour implemented, if it were against the party interest. The impact is pernicious. The reason why so few Britons can name a great Chinese brand or company, despite China&apos;s export success, is that there aren&apos;t any. China needs to build them, but doing that in a one-party authoritarian state, where the party second-guesses business strategy for ideological and political ends, is impossible. In any case, nearly three-fifths of its exports and nearly all its hi-tech exports are made by non-Chinese, foreign firms, another expression of China&apos;s weakness. The state still owns the lion&apos;s share of China&apos;s business and what it does not own, it reserves the right to direct politically. Mark Kitto, a former Welsh Guardsman, has found at first-hand how difficult it is to sustain private ownership in China. He built up three Time Out equivalents in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou but, after seven years of successful magazine publishing, learnt last year that he was about to become a partner of the state. The only terms on which his licence to publish could be retained was if he were to accept a de facto takeover from China Intercontinental Press, controlled by China&apos;s State Information Council, the propaganda mouthpiece of the Communist party. It did not matter that he owned the shares, wanted to retain his independence and had been careful to stay within the party&apos;s publishing guidelines. The party now wanted control of his magazines and simply took it. It is an example repeated many times over. China must become a more normal economy, but the party stands in the way. Chinese consumers need to save less and spend more, but consumers with no property rights or welfare system are highly cautious. To give them more confidence means taxing to fund a welfare system and conceding property rights. That will mean creating an empowered middle class who will ask how their tax renminbi are spent. Companies need to be subject to independent accountability if they are to become more efficient, but that means creating independent centres of power. The political implications are obvious. China&apos;s future is shrouded in uncertainty. My belief is that what is unsustainable is not sustained. Change came in the Soviet Union with the fifth generation of leaders after the revolution; the fifth generation of China&apos;s leaders succeed today&apos;s President Hu Jintao in 2012. No political change will happen until after then, but my guess is that sometime in the mid to late 2010s, the growing Chinese middle class will want to hold Chinese officials and politicians to account for how they spend their taxes and for their political choices. What nobody can predict is whether that will produce another Tiananmen, repression and maybe war if China&apos;s communists pick a fight to sustain legitimacy at home or an Eastern European velvet revolution and political freedoms. Either way, China&apos;s route to becoming a world economic power is not going to proceed as a simple extrapolation of current trends. This book has been something of a personal intellectual odyssey. My hypothesis when I began was that China was so different that it could carry on adapting its model, living without democracy or European enlightenment values. I have changed my mind and now see more clearly than ever the kinds of connection I identified in The State We&apos;re In between economic performance and so-called &apos;soft&apos; institutions - how people are educated, how trust relations are established and how accountability is exercised (just to name a few) - are central. They are equally important to a good society and the chance for individual empowerment and self-betterment. Early in my research, I tried out the still-emergent thesis at a small dinner in Lan Na Thai, one of the restaurants in Shanghai&apos;s Ruijin guest house, a complex of refurbished old mansions and traditional pavilions in the French quarter where communist leaders reputedly once ate and slept. Over stir-fried curried chicken and crispy fried flying sea bass, the Chinese guests repeated politely and persuasively that China was making up new economic and political rules. Afterwards, I chanced to have a few words alone with one of the local rising government stars as we walked out of the complex. He kept his eyes on the ground. &apos;Don&apos;t allow yourself to be dissuaded, despite what you have heard. You are right that China is not different. I want my children to see a China with human rights and democratic institutions. And I am not alone.&apos; He jumped into a taxi and was gone. I have often thought about that chance exchange. Britain and the West take our enlightenment inheritance too easily for granted, and do not see how central it is to everything we are, whether technological advance, trust or well-being. We neither cherish it sufficiently nor live by its exacting standards. We share too quickly the criticism of non-Western societies that we are hypocrites. What China has taught me, paradoxically, is the value of the West, and how crucial it is that we practise what we preach. If we don&apos;t, the writing is on the wall - for us and China. China&apos;s quest for oil China&apos;s foreign policy is increasingly driven by the need to feed its growing appetite for oil. General Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the Chinese general staff, has said that China&apos;s energy problem needs to be taken &apos;seriously and dealt with strategically&apos;. That means less reliance on the Middle East; less transportation of oil via sea-lanes policed by the US navy; more capacity for the Chinese navy to protect Chinese tankers; and more oil brought overland by pipeline from central Asia. Over the past two years, China has pulled off a string of strategic oil deals. In April 2005, Petro China and Canadian company Enbridge signed a memorandum to build a $2bn &apos;gateway&apos; pipeline to move oil from Alberta to the Pacific Coast. In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez is to build a Chinese-financed pipeline to the Pacific coast through Colombia, having given China oil and gas exploration rights in 2005. Saudi Arabia surrendered to Chinese courtship in 2004 and accorded exploration rights. In Sudan, a major source of oil, China&apos;s blind eye to human rights and mass murder if it hinders its interests is demonstrated by Zhou Wenzhong&apos;s comment when Deputy Foreign Minister about the situation in Darfur where more than 250,000 have died.&apos;Business is business,&apos; he said. &apos;We try to separate politics from business and, in any case, the internal position of Sudan is an internal affair, and we are not in a position to influence them.&apos; Wrong: China has substantial influence on Sudan if it chose to exercise it. It does not, a commentary on China&apos;s approach to foreign policy and an awesome warning of the future if an unreconstructed China became yet more powerful. Tiananmen: the legacy The image of a single student halting a tank in Tiananmen Square is one of the most arresting in modern history. But the protests spread well beyond Beijing for six weeks in spring 1989 to encompass demonstrations in 181 cities. The party and army were divided over how to respond; 150 officers openly declared that they would not fire on demonstrators after martial law was declared, and at least a third of the central committee wanted to reach a compromise with the protesters. The party&apos;s then general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, proposed a partial meeting of demands for reform. Nobody should be killed. That was not the view of Deng and the party elders - the eight &apos;immortals&apos;, veterans of the Revolution. A &apos;counter-revolutionary&apos; riot had to be suppressed. But before Deng could act, he had to leave Beijing to ensure that army groups 28 and 29, personally loyal to him, would provide the core of the force rather than the uncertain army groups based around the capital. Once in place, Zhao was then brutally deposed, remaining under house arrest until his death in 2005. Martial law was imposed on 19 May and a fortnight later the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square. Official estimates were that 5,000 soldiers and police officers were wounded and 223 killed. Civilian losses - 2,000 wounded and 220 killed - were lower. Many still languish in prison. Tiananmen is the event that cannot be discussed in China; websites mentioning it are blocked. It was no &apos;counter-revolutionary riot&apos; but a demand for freedoms that infected all China and very nearly succeeded. Current leader Hu Jintao and his successors know they are not Deng and cannot command the loyalty of key elements of the army in the same way. Their best strategy is to deliver growth and jobs while trying to keep the lid on China&apos;s growing but still disconnected social protests. Whether the policy will carry on working is the open question asked daily in Beijing&apos;s inner circles. \u00b7 An edited extract from The Writing on the Wall: China and the West in the 21st Century to be published by Little, Brown on 15 January, \u00a320. \u00a9Will Hutton 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/08/china.bookextracts", "publicationDate": "2007-01-08T11:11:41Z", "tags": ["China", "Books", "World news", "Culture", "Original writing", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Beijing&apos;s authority could fragment and China&apos;s provinces reassert their destructive independence as they did in the 1910s and 20s, or a new and fiercely repressive regime could try to hold the country together abandoning economic openness and market reforms - and even pick some international fights (such as invading Taiwan?)"], "title": "Power, corruption and lies", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday January 13 2007  We omitted the name of the publisher of Will Hutton&apos;s book, The Writing on the Wall, in the extract below. It is Little, Brown.    The emergence of China as a $2 trillion economy from such inauspicious beginnings only 25 years ago is such a giddy accomplishment that the temptation to see its success as proof positive of your own prejudices is overwhelming. And the west&apos;s broad prejudice is that China is growing so rapidly because it has abandoned communism and embraced capitalism. China&apos;s own claim - that it is building a very particular economic model around what it describes as a socialist market economy - is dismissed as hogwash, the necessary rhetoric the Communist party must use to disguise what is actually happening. China proves conclusively that liberalisation, privatisation, market freedoms and the embrace of globalisation are the only route to prosperity. China is on its way to capitalism but will not admit it. But the closer you get to what is happening on the ground in China, its so-called capitalism looks nothing like any form of capitalism the west has known and the transition from communism remains fundamentally problematic. The alpha and omega of China&apos;s political economy is that the Communist party remains firmly in the driving seat not just of government, but of the economy - a control that goes into the very marrow of how ownership rights are conceived and business strategies devised. The western conception of the free exercise of property rights and business autonomy that goes with it, essential to any notion of capitalism, does not exist in China. The truth is that China is not the socialist market economy the party describes, nor moving towards capitalism as the western consensus believes. Rather it is frozen in a structure that I describe as Leninist corporatism - and which is unstable, monumentally inefficient, dependent upon the expropriation of peasant savings on a grand scale, colossally unequal and ultimately unsustainable. It is Leninist in that the party still follows Lenin&apos;s dictum of being the vanguard, monopoly political driver and controller of the economy and society. And it is corporatist because the framework for all economic activity in China is one of central management and coordination from which no economic actor, however humble, can opt out. In this environment genuine wholesale privatisation is impossible and liberalisation has well-defined limits, as President Hu Jintao himself brutally reminds us. The party, he says, &quot;takes a dominant role and coordinates all sectors. Party members and party organisations in government departments should be brought into full play so as to realise the party&apos;s leadership over state affairs&quot;. It may be true that party organisations in the provinces (some with populations bigger than Britain&apos;s) and in the chief cities are jealous of their autonomous local political control, but all retain the discretionary power to do what they choose and override any challenge or complaint from any non-state actor - or, indeed, from state actors if they cross the will of the party. Absolute power corrupts, and the Chinese Communist party has become one of the most corrupt organisations the world has ever witnessed. The combination of absolute power and an ideology that palpably no longer describes reality is a virus that is morally and psychologically undermining the regime. And if the regime wobbles, then its capacity to sustain the unsustainable economic structures will wobble and Leninist corporatism will unravel. Beijing&apos;s authority could fragment and China&apos;s provinces reassert their destructive independence as they did in the 1910s and 20s, or a new and fiercely repressive regime could try to hold the country together abandoning economic openness and market reforms - and even pick some international fights (such as invading Taiwan?) to rally the country to its side. It is because this prospect is so real that the task of peacefully moving to a sustainable capitalism, and building the necessary institutions to do it, is so vital for both China and the world. Ever since the late 1990s the party leadership, then under Hu&apos;s predecessor Jiang Zemin, has rightly become more and more preoccupied with how corruption is corroding the party. &quot;If we do not crack down on corruption, the flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the people will suffer a lot and the party will be in danger of losing its ruling position, or possibly heading for self-destruction,&quot; Jiang declared in 2002, in his last political report to the National Congress. High-level officials had been arrested and imprisoned for embezzlement and racketeering; they included the party secretary and mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong, a member of the Politburo. Cheng Kejie, vice-chairman of the National People&apos;s Congress, was executed for taking pounds 2.5m in kickbacks for arranging land deals and contracts for private business. In the financial system the highest-profile casualties were three of prime minister Zhu Rongji&apos;s hand-picked &quot;can-do commanders&quot;, selected to sort out the financial crisis of the late 1990s, and one of whom, Li Fuxiang, leaped to his death from the seventh floor of Beijing&apos;s Hospital 304 while under investigation. To put this in a British context, it is as if the Mayor of London, the speaker of the House of Commons, the chief executive of HSBC, along with a deputy governor of the Bank of England and the deputy chief executive of the Financial Services Authority had all been imprisoned for fraud with one committing suicide. For all the strengthening of the anti-corruption and Orwellian sounding &quot;Central Discipline Inspection Committee&quot;, corruption remains deeply embedded. The number of arrests of senior cadres members above the county level quadrupled between 1992 and 2001, and since then have included a ring of officials in Gansu, one of China&apos;s poorest provinces, caught embezzling pounds 500m. Four provincial governors and one provincial party secretary have been charged recently - the top posts in China outside Beijing. And in September 2006 came the arrest of Shanghai party secretary and member of the politburo Chen Liangyu for his involvement in the misappropriation of pounds 206m of social security funds. The Chinese economist Hu Angang, in his trailblazing book Great Transformations in China: Challenges and Opportunities, calculates that over the late 90s the cumulative annual cost of corruption was between 13.3% and 16.9% of GDP and is still around that level today. Every incident of corruption - smuggling, embezzlement, theft, swindling, bribery - arises in the first place from the unchallengeable power of communist officials and the lack of any reliable, independent system of accountability and scrutiny. Corruption has become part of the system&apos;s DNA, now threatening the integrity of the state. To see how, look no further than the combination of one-party control and corruption and how it deforms the legal system. The judicial apparatus is politicised from top to bottom. Every president and vice-president of a court is appointed by the party; and the courts are funded by provincial governments. The court bureaucracy works on the same basis as the rest of the government, with a party committee system superintending each rung of the court hierarchy. Judges often make decisions at the instruction of the committee or government independently of the legal merits of the case. Many judges still have no formal legal training - the majority are retired army officers, only too ready to do the party&apos;s bidding. The scale of the corruption is stunning. In 2003, 794 judges were tried for corruption (out of a national total of 200,000). In 2003 and 2004, the presidents of the provincial high courts of Guangdong and Hunan were both found guilty of corruption. When the party does not or cannot influence the judgment in a case, it can use its influence over the police to decide whether to slow down or not enforce the judgment. Enforcement rates in China are lamentable; for example, only 40% of provincial high court decisions are enforced. The lack of a clear system of property rights, with the party-state claiming particular privileges, can make debt enforcement against state organisations close to impossible. As a potential watchdog to correct any of this, the media is crippled. China now has more than 2,000 newspapers, 2,000 television channels, 9,000 magazines and 450 radio stations, but they are all under the watchful eye of the party in Beijing or provincial propaganda departments. These authorities issue daily instructions on what may and may not be reported; journalists who digress will be suspended from working or even imprisoned. China is estimated to have 42 journalists in prison, the highest number in the world. Editors know roughly how much slack they have; but recently, under Hu Jintao, there has been a tightening of the leash. The right to travel independently and report from a non-local city had allowed more aggressive reporting of corruption; but it has been rescinded. Some prominent editors have been fired. For instance, Yang Bin, editor of China&apos;s most forceful tabloid, the Beijing News, was dismissed in 2005 for reporting village protests against unfair confiscation of land. Other journalists have been prohibited from publishing. The Committee to Protect Journalists, in its 2005 report on repression of the media, quotes the government-run People&apos;s Daily: &quot;[During 2004] censorship agencies permanently shut down 338 publications for printing &apos;internal&apos; information, closed 202 branch offices of newspapers, and punished 73 organisations for illegally &apos;engaging in news activities&apos;.&quot; In February 2006, three of China&apos;s most distinguished elders - Li Rui, a former aide to Mao Zedong, Hu Jiwei, former editor of the People&apos;s Daily, and Zhu Houze, a former party propaganda chief - published a letter condemning the approach: &quot;History demonstrates that only a totalitarian system needs news censorship, out of the delusion that it can keep the public locked in ignorance,&quot; they wrote. Far from ensuring stability, they continued, such media repression would &quot;sow the seeds of disaster&quot;. All this is obvious to western eyes; what is less obvious is the way the same system of control undermines the economy. Successful businesses have to be successful in business terms - with managers freely exploiting opportunities, developing products and brands and promoting on ability. No such autonomy is possible within Leninist corporatism; party needs come before those of business, enforced by a national system of party committees in every enterprise, finance from state-owned banks and a complex system of accounting and ownership rights that leaves majority ownership of most enterprises with the state. Private shareholders have very limited ownership rights; companies&apos; fixed assets are separated out in company accounts and can still only be legally owned by state and public bodies. And as MIT economist Yasheng Huang argues, government shareholders interfere, especially if a firm is successful. Countless Chinese firms, he says, have been driven to bankruptcy or thwarted in their growth ambitions because the government has exercised its ownership privileges to meet party objectives. In short, the party state is at the centre of a spiderweb of control of the economy, radiating out from the tight ownership and direction of the 57 sectors the party considers the economy&apos;s strategic heart like steel and energy to a more relaxed stance the less important the party considers an enterprise&apos;s activity - such as packaging or hairdressing. Even they can be controlled if need be. The general rule is that the more politicised and controlled a Chinese enterprise, the lower its productivity and performance. Thus the performance of China&apos;s State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), which control two-thirds of industrial assets, has hardly improved during 20 years of reform. One in three of their employees is estimated to be structurally idle. SOEs are on a financial edge and barely profitable. According to one influential estimate, even the tiniest upward movement in interest rates or the slightest decline in sales would mean that 40%-60% of their enormous bank debts would not be serviced, rendering the entire Chinese banking system bankrupt. They are commercial and business disaster areas. Even large private companies, although better performing, are still affected. Davin Mackenzie, managing director of iVentures, which is based in Beijing, says that almost no private company, however well run, wants to leave the opaque, informal world of guanxi personal relationships in which the main aim is to hide revenue, cash, and profits from potential political direction. The vast majority, he says, run themselves out of the &quot;cash box in the back of the Mercedes&quot;. Most private Chinese companies have three sets of accounts - one for the banks, one for the tax authorities, and one for management. Most do not last long; the average duration is three years. The law of the jungle prevails: you do what you can get away with. China is the counterfeiters&apos; paradise, where intellectual property rights are neither respected nor enforced. Between 15% and 20% of all well-known brands in China are fake; two-thirds of the imports confiscated by US Customs as fakes were made in China. Counterfeiting is estimated to represent 8% of GDP - eloquent testimony to Chinese business strategies and the ineffectiveness of the legal system. The cumulative result of all this is economic weakness, despite the eye-catching growth figures. Innovation is poor; half of China&apos;s patents come from foreign companies. Its growth depends on huge investment, representing an unsustainable 40% or more of GDP financed by peasant savings. But China now needs $5.4 of extra investment to produce an extra $1 of output, a proportion vastly higher than that in economies such as Britain or the US. But 20 years ago, China needed just $4 to deliver the same result. In other words, an already gravely inefficient economy has become even more inefficient. China&apos;s national accounts tell the same story. Hu Angang calculates that China is now back to the Mao years in term of the inefficiency with which it uses capital to generate growth. Behind all these problems lie Leninist corporatism. Capitalism, I contend, is much more than the profit motive and the freedom to set prices which China&apos;s reforms have permitted. It is a system in which many different actors freely take different decisions according to their best judgment; some are right and some are wrong, but the system never has to bet on any one being right for everyone - as in an authoritarian system of centralised economic control. But this economic pluralism is closely intertwined and dependent upon the wider political capacity of different citizens to be able to be part of a public space in which they can debate options and choices. It is because democracies possess such public spaces that, over decades, even the weakest tend to manage themselves better than authoritarian states. There is less likelihood of group-think, conformism and top-down plans that militate against good decisions - or of the quick reversal of poor decisions. This public sphere is a whole network of &quot;soft&quot; independent processes of scrutiny, justification, transparency and accountability that range from a free media to independent justice. Representative government in which the people regularly vote for their governors is but the coping stone of this structure. And the processes of scrutiny and deliberation do not stop just with the state - the same processes are extended to capitalism and the market economy, and through having to justify themselves, makes them more honest and better performing. But none of this can happen if individuals are not free and capable of being involved - and having the capacity, through the independence that property ownership, education, trade union membership and citizenship confers, freely to challenge and change individual policies, whether they are those of the government or the company they work for. These social processes work best the less social distance there is between people. The more inequality and the more social distance, the less well these processes of pluralism, capabilities and accountability can function. And the less well capitalism then functions. So China leads to an unexpected insight. Capitalism works best the more inequality is capped - and the more and better developed its democratic institutions. The west is unforgivably ignorant about China&apos;s shortcomings and weaknesses, which leads it vastly to exaggerate the extent of the Chinese &quot;threat&quot;. China is certainly emerging as a leading exporter, but essentially it is a sub-contractor to the west. It has not bucked the way globalisation is heavily skewed in favour of the rich developed nations. Its productivity is poor; it lacks international champions; its innovation record is lamentable; it relies far too much on exports and investment to propel its economy. To characterise China as an unstoppable force whose economic model is unbeatable and set to swamp us - the stuff of almost every ministerial and business lobby speech - is to make a first-order mistake. Rather, the west needs to understand the depth of China&apos;s problems and the possibility, if not probability, of an economic and political convulsion as China seeks their resolution. What the west must avoid is a position where it forces the Chinese leaders&apos; hand and China retreats towards economic isolation and freezing the reform process. The challenge to the global trading and financial system would be profound; not only would an important source of global demand be scaled back, a key source of financing the US trade deficit would be removed. China&apos;s progress would be shaken to its core. The interest of the west is to help China avoid this fate and encourage a peaceful transition to a pluralist China within a legitimate system of accountability; a country that is comfortable with liberal globalisation and the international rule of law. To describe the goal of policy in this way is demanding enough; more demanding still is to execute it. The simple extrapolations of China&apos;s growth, predicting that it will eventually become a one-party, economic colossus, lead to an alarmist climate in which it is easier to justify trade protection or, in the United States, potential military activism. Such responses are naive. We have to play it long, encourage and help to co-manage the change that must come.

Animals enjoy their perpetually iterating present moments if these are pleasant, and endure them more easily if they are unpleasant because they have no expectation that they will continue being so, or might worsen. One can grant that it is a - the? - human tragedy to have memory and foresight in a life of difficulty, but it is relevant to point out that difficult lives tend to be those that remember the wrong things and are not very good at foresight. Present moments are the richer for being freighted with good memories and enticing plans; that is why one imagines that the present moment of a cow chewing its cud in the shade lacks the depth, height and texture of a human equivalent pondering, let us say, a move to Los Angeles on the back of a $250m deal. As with individuals, so with nations. The bovine option is to live in the present moment too much, forgetting to mount a high point periodically in order to survey the way ahead. The major Anglophone nations of the western world, and perhaps their European friends, are currently very distracted by Iraq and the Middle East generally, and by problems over oil and gas supplies both from there and an increasingly Mafia-like Russia intent on using its throttle-like grasp on pipe-lines to hold its neighbours to ransom. In consequence they appear not to notice that the future, which they could visit if they wished, lies on the banks of the Huangpu River, which flows muddily between the Bund and Pudong in China&apos;s business capital, Shanghai. Proof: there was no US presence at last weekend&apos;s meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), which as &quot;Asean plus three&quot; - joined by China, Japan and South Korea, the three biggest players on East Street - met at Cebu as guests of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines. In what is one of the most telling and resonant remarks of this first decade of the century so far, she said, &quot;We are very happy to have China as our Big Brother in this region.&quot; How apt a phrase that is. Everyone knows about China&apos;s spectacular economic success in the last 10 to 15 years, unleashed by Deng Xiaoping&apos;s remark that it does not matter whether a cat is black or white so long as it catches mice, meaning that ideology must no longer stand in the way of China&apos;s economic growth. And it is a good thing that many in China&apos;s development zones have been lifted out of the functional poverty they lived in just 20 or so years ago when this true Great Leap Forward started in earnest. In those days it took many saved-up ration coupons and half a year&apos;s salary to buy one of those sit-up-and-beg Flying Pigeon bicycles on which the underfed Chinese used to ride, in surreal slow motion, in their tens of thousands, down the wide roads of their cities, along which a bus or truck might occasionally pass (with the engine off, coasting, to save fuel). There is nothing wrong with China becoming the world&apos;s economic superpower in the next 50 years; this will assuredly happen. But it does matter if this happens without a significant change in its political arrangements. Economic liberalisation has happened without liberalisation in much else, and this joint fact - surprising to China-watchers who once predicted that the one would lead to the other as surely dawn leads to day - is ominous, because it is consistent with the thesis that a Chinese colleague and I advanced in our jointly written (and pseudonymous - to protect his identity) book written 12 years ago, The Long March to the Fourth of June, which is that the leadership of the Communist party of China desires not just economic but military hegemony, and it does so because it wishes to revive the glory days of China&apos;s brilliant past - the Han or Tang or early Qing dynasty glories, when China was in every sense truly Zhong Guo, the central kingdom of the earth. Fanciful? Well: look at the rapid and dazzling development of China&apos;s military. Its once vast but useless - because poorly equipped and practically untrained - army has been slimmed but potentiated into one of the world&apos;s leading forces. China is a nuclear weapons power, and a major manufacturer and exporter of arms. It is determined not to allow a repetition of its humiliation at the hands of the North Vietnamese in the 1970s, and it is equally determined to have the military muscle to force reintegration of Taiwan, to gain control of the East and South China Seas - the latter as far as and including the Spratly Islands - to control the gas reserves that lie under each. For China is the world&apos;s second fuel-hungriest nation, and speeding towards becoming the hungriest; it is in no mood to allow its supplies to be compromised. It has built deep-water harbours in Pakistan and Bangladesh - with its own labour, note, for security reasons - to maintain oil supplies from the Middle East, and it will defend them if necessary; and so for its African oil-producing client states. As it jets rapidly towards its objectives China likes to keep the rest of the world looking in another direction. It likes the Iraq situation for this reason. It funds delinquent regimes - Zimbabwe is one egregious example - partly to extend its foothold in neglected but future-useful parts of the world (it is a big player in Africa already) and partly to keep the west off-balance with lots of little local fires in problematic regions. Meanwhile, at home the huge interior where poverty still reigns, where farmers still plough with oxen as they did two thousand years ago, there are disturbances, riots, minor rebellions, attacks on police stations, almost every week. The restive, secretive country hides and controls its difficulties, its immense army of deracinated migrant labour, its problems and insecurities, behind a veil of propaganda, censorship, and harsh policing. The speed of industrial development has created environmental damage to China that will take hundreds of billions of dollars and many, many decades to clean up. China is in a pollution crisis, but that is another secret rarely discussed. People die in mining and industrial accidents every day; the pace of development is too quick for health and safety regulations. Another secret that is not so secret is the fact that many western companies in joint ventures with Chinese companies find life hard-going, because of cheating and corruption, because the dice are loaded against them and the goalposts shifted whenever it suits the Chinese. And the &quot;vast potential market&quot; of China is a reality still to materialise, since almost all of its 1.3 billion people are in no position to buy the kinds of goods or services that western countries provide. The western companies operating in China are there to profit (literally) from the cheap labour and services for export back to the west. This is why China owns most of the US debt - in the trillions - and could if it wished switch off the world economy&apos;s lights by calling it in. And by the way, as the Tiananmen Square massacre shows, they are not above cutting off their own noses in certain circumstances, should they think they will save the rest of their face by doing so: as presently constituted they are not a good country to be holding anyone&apos;s debt. Worst is the human rights record in China, and the fact that the west does nothing about it, those dollar bills dangling in front of its glazed eyes. There are 62 capital offences in China, including embezzlement and interpretations of extra-marital sex deemed by the authorities to count as rape. China executes more people in a year than the rest of the world put together. Corneas and kidneys from the executed are said to be used in transplants, and the families of the executed pay for the bullets used. There are millions of prisoners in &quot;administrative detention&quot; (that is, without trial) in the vast gulag of forced labour camps in China&apos;s Qinghai province and elsewhere. Almost everyone reading these words will touch something made in a prison camp in China every week: plastic chopsticks, paper bags, simple things usually. As all the great economies of the world started out by doing, China&apos;s economy depends on slave labour to give it part of its boost; that is why some of its exports - the widgety, plastic things - are so cheap. Yet still China was given WTO membership and is treated as a respectable member of the world community. China maintains a savagely brutal occupation of Tibet, and an oppressive occupation of Xinjiang and Mongolia. Arguably its south-western provinces, home of its &quot;minority peoples&quot;, are occupied lands too. Its irredentism means that it will not rest until it has Taiwan back under Beijing&apos;s control; its sabre-rattling, threats and bullying towards Taiwan are a constant. Recently I was asked to give a short course at a university in Shanghai. Then the invitation was withdrawn by the administrators of the course, because they feared that critical things I had written about China would reflect badly on themselves in the eyes of the authorities. Thus does self-censorship and self-monitoring do the work of repressive regimes for them. Interestingly, the course was in business ethics; had it been in philosophy or the history of ideas it would probably not have been a problem. But business exists under the floodlights there. (And it sure needs some ethics.) China has a brilliant cultural past (more than half obliterated by the current regime&apos;s mad rush to make everywhere look like Manhattan as a signature of modernity), and wonderful people. Look at the Chinese outside the People&apos;s Republic for an indication of what they are like when left alone to be themselves. But while in China itself they are politically squashed under the incubus of a party that dreams of being the US of the future - and without US-style democratic checks and elections and changes of presidency as an at least partial restraint - the future for the rest of us is not so rosy. At very least the world community ought to demand that China observe standards and norms on human rights, political participation, labour practices and environmental protection, as the price of membership among responsible nations. Then we need not be so fearful that even more of a bully is going to take over from the US before the end of this century as the dominating player in world affairs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/jan/17/cnetjournalistsandthewhole", "publicationDate": "2007-01-17T11:13:32Z", "tags": ["Media"], "sentences": ["launched this service in Taiwan first and Taylor said the combination of algorithmic and social search has dramatically changed Yahoo!&apos;s share of the search query market."], "title": "CNET, journalists and the whole social net thing", "article": "Publishing is abuzz with talk of social networks and communities, but how exactly do commercial publishers grapple with this new frontier of the web? The Association of Online Publishers held a forum on this yesterday where CNET and Yahoo! both gave case studies on building communities around content. Everyone present works in online publishing and wants to understand out how to develop social networking and community tools for their publications. The thinking is that where you have more engagement you have more loyalty and that, at some point, translates into more revenue. Web purists would say that whole idea goes against the more philanthropic side of web culture, but hey, I don&apos;t make the rules. Suzie Daniels, head of business media at CNET Networks, quite sensibly opens by saying that she really doesn&apos;t know all the answers but she does know enough to compile damn good bullet points, which is a start. Daniels outlined CNET&apos;s move towards what Tim O&apos;Reilly (the Web 2.0 guy) described as architected participation. [Update: See CNET&apos;s community site.] She said CNET&apos;s core mission was to interpret and filter content and that that will remain the same, but that the public have different expectations about the media they use and expect to be able to find and use their voice to participate in the community around it. Her visual representation of CNET&apos;s proposition was typically bold: a triangle represents the audience base with CNET as a circle covering the top third of that group. The circle omitted the highest point of the triangle, which Daniels described as the &quot;true freaks&quot; of the audience - those that live, breathe and sleep tech are maybe a bit too obsessive to be useful. I wonder if we have those on Organ Grinder? Attracting &quot;thought leaders&quot; Talking about that top third audience, Daniels said: &quot;It may not necessarily be that many people but what they say is incredibly valuable. We want to enable those thought-leading people to engage with the site and give them a platform equal with our editorial team. And if we can get our thought leaders to contribute, the lurkers will benefit more.&quot; Daniels was referring to CNET&apos;s new-ish &quot;My CNET&quot; type feature, where users can set up their own profile page, add comments to stories, write their own blog and so on. The most frequent contributors can even get their byline on the front page - which CNET&apos;s own journalists can&apos;t. Sometimes the editorial staff mutter about P45s being handed out, she said, because the readers are &quot;taking over the site&quot;. Members&apos; blogs currently account for about 10% of content on the site. Professional networking She described the site&apos;s community as social and professional networking, given the professional IT and computing industry readership of the sites. The trick, she said, is not to bolt on the community&apos;s content but to integrate it with the editorial &quot;centre of gravity&quot;. &quot;We want to find and draw in passionate, high-value users who are respected by their peers for their knowledge. We want to solicit their knowledge in a way that complements our core mission, and that is what readers expect from our brand.&quot; CNET has to reward and promote those high-value users to encourage them to contribute more, and also translate and contextualise their contributions to make them relevant and accessible for the wider audience. For the site&apos;s journalists, it means working with users in a different way - as a seeder of ideas rather than a de facto resource for every idea on a certain subject. And the advertisers? She added that although CNET has not monetised these very lively community areas and would not want to risk upsetting them just yet, these are very attractive environments for advertisers and in preliminary talks, they have seen the long-term benefit for their brands. &quot;These are our most valued users and we don&apos;t want to piss them off. On the flip side, we know just about everything about these users and that has a benefit in the way we sell the site.&quot; Cultural change Many of these changes require a broader cultural change among CNET&apos;s management and the biggest of those changes are among the editorial team - even though CNET only publishes online and hasn&apos;t had to make the cultural adjustments of, say, a title adapting its print product for the web. Those complaints about the users taking over and &quot;the end of journalism as we know it&quot; may well be true, she said. But though it might be the end of journalism as we know it, it&apos;s not the end of journalism. We just need to think a bit differently. Daniel&apos;s impression is that editorial staff have often been &quot;a bit snotty&quot; about the idea of meeting or talking to readers. These new environments mean that journalists have to let go of that prejudice and get involved. CNET&apos;s journalists are expected to answer every question that comes in through the blogs and reader comments, and get involved in every debate that has legs. Blogging journalists mustn&apos;t hide behind a brand Every journalist has their own blog and are not allowed to &quot;hide behind a brand&quot;, she said. They must use their real name because users nowadays expect transparency, honesty and authenticity. Where the authority of editors used to be in being in charge, it is now in participating and building a relationship and credibility with users in a more direct way. The life of a journalist, she said, looks very different now and is as much about responding and blogging as reporting. &quot;The more that you demonstrate your trust, the more users will input into the community. If you want to steer the conversation, even invisibly, you have to be in it and it is incumbent for journalists to be part of that.&quot; And Yahoo!&apos;s answer to social search? Steven Taylor looks after Yahoo!&apos;s social media products, amongst others things, in his role as regional vice president of Yahoo! Europe. He managed to last nearly the entire session without mentioning Google, but it slipped out right at the end when he was explaining why he thought Yahoo!&apos;s Answers product had succeeded where Google&apos;s had failed. Until now, he explained, search has been about core quality, relevance, freshness and the right algorithms that help you find what you want. That has broadened into vertical, localised searches, image and video search and now areas like mobile search. &quot;We see search in a particular way because we are also a publisher,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps more so than our competitor, who is extremely good at the thinking about algorithms and speed, but we have branched into content and people.&quot; 350 trillion pages of human knowledge Yahoo! believes that he next stage for search is in making searches more human. &quot;If you take a view about what we all know, and that we all have opinions, observations, experiences at different points in time over a lifetime.&quot; Taylor reckoned that if all of us potentially hold 20 billion &quot;pages&quot; of knowledge and information, that&apos;s a total of 350 trillion potential pages. 350 trillion pages? Quite how he came to that figure, or how you could ever calculate that, I don&apos;t know. But Yahoo! thinks the answer is social search, and Yahoo! Answers is their stab at that. Taylor demonstrated the point by searching for &quot;Arsenal FC&quot; - that produced 7.9m results. But searching for &quot;everything Steven knows about Arsenal FC&quot; produced nothing - yet he has years of photos, memories and experience of following the team. Yahoo! Answers invites users to ask those fuller, more natural questions and instead of answering them with algorithms, asks other users to answer them. The thought is that over time this will create a vast bank of knowledge covering all sorts of subjects. Yahoo! launched this service in Taiwan first and Taylor said the combination of algorithmic and social search has dramatically changed Yahoo!&apos;s share of the search query market. His figures put Yahoo! at 71% share with Google on 26% and he predicts a similar impact on the European market. So why should this work? &quot;It&apos;s about trust and the way people engage with each other. The most common question is how do you trust the answer? In two ways: you get multiple answers, so you are given context, and you use reputation management systems so the power answerers rise to the top&quot;. Nope, I&apos;m not sure &quot;answerers&quot; is a word either, but it is in Yahoo! world. &quot;Reputation management systems&quot; means ratings for answers and for users. Taylor also described those &quot;power answerers&quot; as knowledge partners, many of whom have their own blogs. They contribute their time and expertise to Answers, and Yahoo! provides a platform for publicising them. &quot;What started with a search hat on has become something that is about our audience becoming publishers in their own right. And in our role as publishers we are now managers and facilitators of lots of people&apos;s content as opposed to just providers and aggregators. This is where Yahoo! sees the future.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/19/revengeofthecif", "publicationDate": "2007-01-19T22:03:43Z", "tags": ["China", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Of course no sensible person can be happy at Beijing&apos;s action, not least if you look at the 900-plus missiles aimed at Taiwan."], "title": "Lost in space", "article": "The US reprimand to China over its successful anti-satellite test has all the sincerity of King Herod leading a Unicef fund-raiser. As inventors of the rocket, the Chinese have every bit as much tenure in orbit as the country that belatedly followed Sputnik into space. Of course no sensible person can be happy at Beijing&apos;s action, not least if you look at the 900-plus missiles aimed at Taiwan. But test was entirely legal - and it is so because the United States has consistently blocked any international convention to &quot;limit its freedom of manoeuvre&quot; in space. Restated only last year, US military doctrine is that it should control beyond earth orbit, and make sure nobody else can challenge it, which is why it will not accept any treaty demilitarizing space. This has been yet another of those remarkable obsessions of the Republican right and neocons, going back to the Reagan administration. One of the Bush administration&apos;s first reactions to the distinctly sub-orbital airliners smashing into the World Trade Center was to boost spending on the &quot;Strategic Defence Initiative&quot; - Star Wars. The US has spent well over $100 billion so far on it. And so far it has fairly consistently failed to hit the missile equivalent of a brightly painted fish glued in a barrel. MIT professor Theodore A Postol has over the years unveiled the outright deceptions perpetrated by the Pentagon to claim success from abject failure in the hugely expensive anti-missile programme. Now, since it all depends on US spy satellites, the Chinese test threatens to bring the whole faith-based programme tumbling out of orbit to impact on solid reality. Indeed, for a hugely expensive military failure, its only competition in costliness has been the Iraq War itself - which is of course one of the reasons that the Chinese could persuade themselves that the test was necessary. This obsession with outer space, shown in his decision to invade Mars, is almost as mysterious as George W Bush&apos;s fixation on Iraq. Ironically his Yale Transcript gave him his very lowest score in Astronomy with 69, even lower than his 71 in political science classes. Even so, if you sometimes suspect that Darth Vader is stalking the corridors of a reality-challenged White House and Pentagon, you may not be so far wrong. Along with the &quot;Strategic Defence Initiative,&quot; Bush&apos;s Moon and Mars projects are an almost certainly motivated by an attempt to ensure that the Force is always with US. And the genesis of the Star Wars programme was indeed science fiction. Hard-right hard-SF writer Larry Niven boasted: &quot;The scheme that drove the Soviet Union bankrupt was first-drafted at my house in Tarzana, by about fifty good people invited and led by Jerry Pournelle (another SF writer of similar views). We were gathered to build a space program, with costs and schedules, to submit to Ronald Reagan via his science adviser. We generated the Space Defense Initiative (or &apos;Star Wars&apos; if you didn&apos;t like it.)&quot; Niven recounted that other SF writers, like Robert A Heinlein (Starship Troopers!) and Poul Anderson, along with retired general Daniel Graham and the astronaut Buzz Aldrin, joined lobbyists from companies like Boeing in the &quot;Citizens&apos; Advisory Council on National Space Policy&quot;, which he credits with Reagan&apos;s 1983 Star Wars speech. As Frances FitzGerald author of Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War, put it laconically about the myth of Star Wars crashing the Evil Empire: &quot;The evidence for this proposition is wanting.&quot; She explains, &quot;Soviet spending on strategic weapons was a very small fraction of the overall Soviet military budget.&quot; The people who invented Iraqi WMD&apos;s had a dry run on this one. FitzGerald noted that the analysts who actually looked at the data concluded that Moscow&apos;s weapons procurement programs were flat, while its spending on strategic missile systems had actually dropped by 40% from 1976 to 1983. The administration suppressed those reports in favour of more threatening and politically correct estimates, just as later Star Wars test failures were rewritten as successes.

The crux of US defence capability is its command-and-control networks, which are reliant on satellite capabilities. This is a clear statement that China does not want to see [US] hegemony of what they call &quot;the space arena&quot;. There were allegations late last summer that an American optical surveillance satellite had been illuminated by a Chinese laser system. This can be regarded as a symbolic gesture but, if true, it means they can track a satellite and potentially blind it as it passes over China. The Chinese have now demonstrated that they can track, target and destroy in space. Leading analysts of the murky world of Chinese shashoujian weapons are growing suspicious that China will aim to counter its perceived enemies with anti-satellite and directed-energy systems, micro-satellite configurations and jamming weaponry. Worrisome, too, is the potential to detonate nuclear devices in space, releasing an electromagnetic pulse that could cripple space assets in the targeted vicinity. These moves come at a time when Russia and China have made international calls to restrain those attempting to take warfare into the space domain. A Sino-Russian UN working paper, proposed in May 2002, called for a ban on weapons in orbit.

Formal protests were lodged with the Beijing government, accompanied by expressions of concern from world leaders, including Tony Blair. The Bush administration is privately seething over the event and is believed to be preparing to turn the incident into a major diplomatic spat. The concern in the US is that the satellite-killing missile test - said by the US national security council to have been carried out on January 11 - demonstrated China has the capability to knock out its military satellite system, which the Pentagon depends on for navigation and surveillance. American military and diplomatic analysts said a Chinese attack on about 40 to 50 satellites in low orbit round the world would leave the country&apos;s military blinded within a matter of hours. But others, more sceptical about US policy, insist China had a right to challenge the US&apos;s effective monopoly of space. They noted that Beijing has repeatedly pressed for the US to sign agreements outlawing arms in space, overtures Washington has repeatedly rejected. A Chinese government spokesman, Liu Jianchao, refused to confirm the missile strike had taken place. He said he could not comment because he had no knowledge of such a test. He insisted China supported the peaceful use of space. The Russian government, which claims to favour demilitarisation of space, expressed doubts about the nature of the test, claiming it was only a rumour that it was a demonstration of an anti-satellite capability. Its defence minister, Sergei Ivanov, said: &quot;I&apos;m afraid that it didn&apos;t have an anti-satellite basis. And, maybe, it&apos;s good that it didn&apos;t.&quot; But the US, Britain, Japan, Australia and other countries had no doubts. Downing Street, while acknowledging China had broken no treaties, expressed dismay that it gave no advance warning of its action. A No 10 spokesman revealed that Whitehall had protested on Wednesday, arguing that the test is &quot;inconsistent&quot; with Beijing&apos;s earlier assurances to the UN on the military use of space, and will add to the space debris problem. Downing St said: &quot;We don&apos;t believe that this does contravene international law. What we are concerned about, however, is lack of consultation and we believe that this development of this technology and the manner in which this test was conducted is inconsistent with the spirit of China&apos;s statements to the UN and other bodies on the military use of space.&quot; The destruction of the Chinese satellite was the first such attack in space since the US carried out a similar test in 1985, when Ronald Reagan was pursuing the Star Wars anti-missile defence programme. The US, which has been trying to establish a closer relationship with China, has been reluctant recently to criticise Beijing but on Thursday lodged a formal protest. Relations between the US and China have been improving since a stand-off in 2001 when a US surveillance aircraft was forced to land on Hainan island. Dana Perino, the deputy White House press secretary, said yesterday that Chinese officials had not yet responded to concerns expressed by the US. &quot;We do want cooperation on a civil space strategy, so until we hear back from them or have more information, I don&apos;t have any more to add,&quot; she said. Although China offers no threat at present, the fear is that if there were a stand-off over Taiwan, the Chinese might be tempted by the option of destroying US satellites. Worry was also expressed by China&apos;s near neighbours, Japan and South Korea. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said &quot;We must use space for peace. We are asking the Chinese government about the test.&quot; Alexander Downer, the Australian foreign minister, who was on a visit to New York, said Beijing&apos;s ambassador to Australia, Fu Ying, had been called in for an explanation. &quot;Our concern about this is that to have a capacity to shoot down satellites in outer space is not consistent with ... the traditional Chinese position of opposition to the militarisation of outer space,&quot; Mr Downer said. The test has come as &quot;a bit of a nasty shock&quot;, according to Kerry Brown, China expert and associate fellow at the international affairs thinktank Chatham House, in London. Politically, it is a sign that China will be extending its commercial and economic power to more military areas, he said. Mr Brown could not see any particular significance in the timing but he thought similar events would be more likely in the future. &quot;China is asserting its capacity, showing its ability to be autonomous and not needing to stand in anyone&apos;s shadow.&quot; Some analysts suggested yesterday that the test was a warning shot directed at US operations in north-east Asia and America&apos;s allies in the region, but played down the immediate implications for a future &quot;Star Wars&quot; crisis or a US-Chinese arms race. The leading Liberal Democrat expert, Lord Wallace, said that the Chinese move had no direct impact on European security but would be likely to affect Europe because of the effect it would have on the US where a strong Republican lobby believes China is America&apos;s main threat. &quot;It is likely to feed back into the anti-missile defence debate,&quot; Lord Wallace predicted, making the US sensitive to EU military and hi-tech exports to China as it was during the largely symbolic row over the arms embargo several years ago."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/20/china.spaceexploration", "publicationDate": "2007-01-20T00:15:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Space", "Science", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China has been alarmed by the deployment of America&apos;s National Missile Defence (NMD), which would not only could negate its nuclear deterrent, but could also be extended to Taiwan.", "Hundreds of Chinese missiles point at Taiwan, and if these could be intercepted by US missiles or lasers directed by satellites in space, then the logical step for China would be to prove that it could knock one down.", "The concerns of China&apos;s closest neighbours, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, are real, but without an international treaty, with what authority can any critic speak?"], "title": "Leader: China in space", "article": "China&apos;s great leap forward into space had proceeded nobly since Yang Liwei, the first &quot;taikonaut&quot;, went up four years ago in something called a Divine Vessel and admitted that he couldn&apos;t see the Great Wall from space. But the serenity of the space programme was shattered by yesterday&apos;s reports that China had destroyed an old weather satellite by hitting it with a &quot;kinetic kill vehicle&quot; launched from a ballistic missile. Both the high-flown language and bits of satellite rapidly came down to earth. The report, first published by Aviation Weekly, set off the panic buttons in Taipei, Tokyo, Washington and Moscow, but there could have been little surprise that a new athlete had joined the arms race in space. For much of the past decade, one of the loudest voices raised against the weaponisation of space had been Chinese. A white paper published nine years ago talked of space belonging to all mankind, to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes. Since then, China and Russia have locked horns with Washington on the need for a binding international legal instrument on the Prevention of An Arms Race in Outer Space (Paros). The issue has deadlocked wider progress in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, despite attempts by China to relax the link between an ad hoc committee on Paros and an eventual treaty. China has been alarmed by the deployment of America&apos;s National Missile Defence (NMD), which would not only could negate its nuclear deterrent, but could also be extended to Taiwan. A Pentagon war game in Colorado in 2001 made the connection explicit, by pitting the US against an opponent who was threatening &quot;a small neighbour&quot;. Hundreds of Chinese missiles point at Taiwan, and if these could be intercepted by US missiles or lasers directed by satellites in space, then the logical step for China would be to prove that it could knock one down. Under these rules, the satellite would be just as dangerous as the missiles they direct. So neither China nor Washington has much to crow about as they chase each other down a well-worn path. In Washington, the National Security Council spokesman said the testing of such weapons was inconsistent with the spirit of cooperation that both countries aspire to in the civil-space arena. These are weasel words from a nation that has poured billions of dollars into NMD and research on space-borne weapons, defying the warnings that it was jeopardising decades of negotiation on limiting the size and scope of ballistic missile systems. The concerns of China&apos;s closest neighbours, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, are real, but without an international treaty, with what authority can any critic speak?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/21/china.features", "publicationDate": "2007-01-21T00:05:10Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Life and style", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["wants a piece of the action, though, for the cream of Shanghai society is here, as well as crowds of eager but incredibly well-behaved fans, and celebrities galore: singers from Taiwan in head-to-toe Versace; actresses from Hong Kong in slashed-to-the-thigh Liz Hurley-style numbers; a 14-member boy band consisting of the finalists of the Chinese version of Pop Idol, and great flocks of 6ft models who skitter up the red carpet like nervous gazelles expecting an attack by water buffalo.", "Inside, a Jeremy Beadle lookalike from Taiwan with impressively bouffy hair is compering."], "title": "Carole Cadwalladr on the millionaires turning Shanghai into the biggest boom town in history", "article": "The last time the Chinese police really captured the world&apos;s attention was back in 1989, when they appeared on the TV hitting Chinese students over the head with big sticks. They still have the sticks, it turns out, and the ability to look impassive in the face of a large and determined crowd. But outside the Shanghai Oriental Arts Centre, more than anything else they just look a bit confused. There are people waving thick white invitations at them and bunches of flowers. Read any human-rights report on China and sooner or later you&apos;ll see the word &apos;policeman&apos; coupled with words such as &apos;torture&apos; or &apos;brutality&apos;. And yet here they are, a 200-strong battalion, stationed out the front of the China Fashion Awards, ensuring that no celebrity should suffer the indignity of walking more than two yards from their chauffeur-driven limo to the red carpet, and that the footballers&apos; hairdos don&apos;t get drizzled on. Worse, it turns out that the event&apos;s sponsors include OK!. The official role of the cops therefore appears to be to protect the global business interests of Richard Desmond, the founder of OK! and former publisher of Asian Babes, Big Ones and Horny Housewives, titles unlikely to get past the Chinese censors any time soon. Protecting ex-porn barons is one thing in the People&apos;s Republic of China, but possessing pornography is a crime that can result in the Re-education Through Labour Committee sending you to a labour camp for three years. It&apos;s not hard to see why OK! wants a piece of the action, though, for the cream of Shanghai society is here, as well as crowds of eager but incredibly well-behaved fans, and celebrities galore: singers from Taiwan in head-to-toe Versace; actresses from Hong Kong in slashed-to-the-thigh Liz Hurley-style numbers; a 14-member boy band consisting of the finalists of the Chinese version of Pop Idol, and great flocks of 6ft models who skitter up the red carpet like nervous gazelles expecting an attack by water buffalo. Inside, a Jeremy Beadle lookalike from Taiwan with impressively bouffy hair is compering. A 24-year-old from a local English-language magazine, Claire (like all the English-speaking Chinese, she&apos;s taken an English name) translates for me with an increasingly surreal commentary. &apos;She was Chinese Vogue&apos;s first cover star,&apos; she whispers when one of the gazelles walks on stage. &apos;We think she is very ugly. He is very famous because he changes his hairstyle often. That singer in the band - he is deaf. And dumb.&apos; &apos;Is he... popular?&apos; I ask. &apos;Oh yes,&apos; she says. &apos;People love him!&apos; In fact, the show doesn&apos;t require all that much translation. The evening largely consists of a succession of glossy, shiny people coming up on stage, each glossier and shinier than the last, right up until the moment a middle-aged man in a drab suit with bottle-lens glasses and a balding head sweeps into the spotlight. &apos;He is the chairman of Shanghai Media,&apos; whispers Claire. &apos;The government.&apos; He&apos;s so alien, so totally out of place, that I half-expect him to speak in the synthesised electronic tones of R2D2. He&apos;s here to present the Male Fashion Icon of the Year award, and as a man with spiky red hair steps up to accept the prize, they form a tableau vivant: old China meets new China. Can this really be what ex-president Deng Xiaoping meant when he talked about &apos;socialism with Chinese characteristics&apos; almost 30 years ago? When I ask Claire how they decide the winners, she shrugs her shoulders, but it all seems a bit of a stitch-up. Procter &amp; Gamble is another of the sponsors, and although there&apos;s a whole football team from Prada and another from Hermes taking up the front two rows, Brand of the Year goes to Lux, a cheapo soap bar that P&amp;G just happens to make. But the evening is as good an introduction as any to the forces at work in modern China. For a start, there&apos;s the unedifying spectacle of western companies desperately ingratiating themselves with a Chinese audience (China&apos;s economy grew by 10.4 per cent last year, with foreign investment reaching \u00a32.27bn). The Dutch chairman of Unilever goes on stage and thanks the producers for a show that he declares is &apos;so edgy, so groovy and so swinging&apos;. There are whispers among the audience that the awards aren&apos;t totally above board. But I learn later that that&apos;s how business is conducted here, namely by the traditional virtue of guanxi. Or in other words, through elaborate social relationships rather than on merit. There&apos;s also the stark division between rural China, where 900m people live largely in poverty, and urban China - the 400m people who have already made the country the third-largest consumer of luxury goods in the world and by 2015 are predicted to have shopped it into first place. Indeed, the crowd grows restless when a film is shown of some barefoot Chinese children, and only snaps to attention again when some models in short skirts are brought on. And then, finally, there are the brands, the labels, the designer dresses - lots of them. Or as Julien, a Frenchman who works for Prada, sums it up: &apos;It&apos;s all money, money, money. Even two years ago it was normal; now it has gone totally crazy. We have eight stores already, but we are opening more. Dozens more. You have to see these people when they come in to the shop. Oh my God! They carry bags of cash with them! Plastic bags full of cash!&apos; Although it&apos;s not just Julien who tells me this, it&apos;s everybody I meet. A model-turned-PR asks me to guess the worst social crime you can commit in Shanghai. It&apos;s not a very good game, to be honest. &apos;Child abuse?&apos; I hazard. She shakes her head. &apos;No! It is to give someone a fake!&apos; she says, just a little too solemnly. &apos;This is the worst thing! Unforgivable!&apos; And then she wags her finger at me. The real action takes place at the after-party, a glamorous affair held on the 66th floor of the Le Royal Meridien hotel, where the champagne flows and from every window there is another staggering view: skyscrapers upon skyscrapers; neon pinks and greens and yellows whichever way you look - up, down, sideways; and on the river below, vast floating video screens that cruise silently by projecting images of speeding Chevrolets and Jaguars. It&apos;s like Blade Runner: The Cocktail Party, and I&apos;m beginning to see what the chairman of Unilever means. It is so groovy and so edgy and so swinging: we&apos;re 66 floors up a skyscraper in the most successful city of the country with the fastest economic growth in the world. It feels like being at the epicentre of the future. PT Black, the American partner of a company that conducts market research for western firms desperate to crack the secrets of the world&apos;s biggest market, tells me about a recent survey which asked people in 80 countries whether they thought tomorrow would be better than today. &apos;Only three countries in the world answered positively. And by far and away the most positive was China: 83 per cent said yes. People really believe in progress here.&apos; But then how could they not, when the view from the windows is of Pudong? Fifteen years ago it was swamp land; now it&apos;s home to 4m people and headquarters to dozens of international companies. But when I start talking to Lu Kun, a couture designer, and ask what he thinks of fashion in Shanghai, he makes a face. &apos;Not much,&apos; he says. &apos;Everybody is just copying [counterfeiting western designs]. Do you know what the greatest social insult is here?&apos; &apos;Yes! It&apos;s to give someone a fake!&apos; &apos;Exactly! They are buying stuff that is made in China, shipped to Italy, marked up 500 times and then shipped back to China. Where they put the price up again!&apos; I later find out that between 15-20 per cent of all well-known brands in China are fake. But tonight, with a lot of people getting drunk on free champagne, there&apos;s the golden whiff of opportunity in one of the greatest boom towns in history. Only Charlie, it seems, is sober. He&apos;s an advertising exec from Beijing, in his mid-thirties, and the only doomy person in the room. Maybe the entire city. &apos;It&apos;s insane!&apos; he says. &apos;Everything - the money. The poverty. The urbanisation. The exhaustion of our natural resources. These opportunities that are beyond anything that anybody in Europe or America has seen before or will ever see again. It&apos;s mad, if you think about it. But no one is thinking about it, because it&apos;s impossible to hold it all in your head.&apos; It&apos;s 4am, and we&apos;re at the after-party of the after-party in a newly opened private members&apos; club called Volar designed by Philippe Starck. But Charlie has things to get off his chest. &apos;My sister is nine years older than me and she is completely different because she grew up during the Cultural Revolution [1966-1976], and I grew up after it. It&apos;s like we are totally different breeds. She had to go and work in a factory. I cannot even imagine how hard her life has been. And she&apos;s my sister.&apos; Charlie pauses, then says, &apos;There is this overwhelming optimism. But at the heart of us all is this enormous insecurity. Look what happened to our parents. Me? I&apos;m always looking for escape routes.&apos; &apos;Yes,&apos; I say, looking around, thinking that maybe Philippe Starck&apos;s brothel look is not my favourite and wondering how on earth I&apos;m going to get back to my hotel, when Charlie interrupts: &apos;This is what the whole of China is like! It&apos;s like being in a dodgy club! And never knowing if you will be able to get a taxi out!&apos; The next night I&apos;m back on the 66th floor of the Le Royal Meridien for a &apos;private shopping evening&apos; organised by Qeelin, China&apos;s first luxury jewellery brand. The signature piece is a panda pendant, studded with 300 diamonds, on sale for \u00a36,000. One of the shoppers is a man called Joe, who&apos;s in his late twenties and runs the Ferrari club. &apos;It&apos;s for me and my friends. We turn up and drive around places in our Ferraris.&apos; It&apos;s quite equal opportunities, though: they&apos;ll also let you in if you drive a Porsche. He already owns nine cars (a Porsche 911, a Mercedes, a BMW X5, a Mitsubishi Evolution, a Toyota Yaris, a... oh, my pen simply gives out at this point) and is about to buy a Lamborghini. Then there&apos;s his apartment in Shanghai and his house in Eastbourne. Eastbourne? &apos;It&apos;s near where I went to school.&apos; Boarding school, it turns out, for Joe is a member of that other elite club: the first generation of Chinese to have inherited wealth. His father owns several hotels and &apos;around 2,000 apartments&apos;. You get blase about meeting the super-rich in Shanghai. It&apos;s a city of newly made bao fa hu - the &apos;explosively rich&apos;. Yuan Yuan, 32, an events organiser with a PR company, tells us about her friend Steven. &apos;He makes just this one tiny component for Sharp mobile phones. This one,&apos; and she points to the little socket into which the charger plugs. &apos;And he has six factories, and 6,000 employees, and each factory makes RMB2m [renminbi - \u00a3130,000] a month. Each factory! And he doesn&apos;t know what to spend it on.&apos; The next day we go off to the golf academy, where we meet Michael Dickie, a Scottish golf coach, who tells us about a golf club that costs $180,000 to join. &apos;My one is much cheaper - only $100,000.&apos; We take a taxi to go and meet one of his students, 35-year-old Wu Xin, or James, and drive through a scrappy little neighbourhood until suddenly we arrive at Rancho Sante Fe. It&apos;s a private compound with huge villas made of fake adobe and a whole mini-army of private guards. James&apos;s villa has manicured lawns, a deck overlooking the lake, a barbecue pit, an ornamental well and a perfectly groomed labrador retriever called Wang Wang. Ten years ago James had nothing; now not only does he have this house, which he bought for \u00a33m, he&apos;s also bought apartments for his parents, his wife Vina&apos;s parents, his sister and his wife&apos;s sister. And he&apos;s only in his mid-thirties. He built his own chain of clothing stores from the ground up, and now owns an empire that spans China, although these days he&apos;s mostly concentrating on his investments. His son attends the British school and goes horse-riding, and as a family they holiday in Europe, South Africa, Australia and southeast Asia. They&apos;re so friendly and they give us a tour of the house, but there&apos;s a rather unsettling moment when they show us a girl&apos;s bedroom with a doll&apos;s tea set and flowery bedspread. &apos;For a daughter,&apos; says James. &apos;But you don&apos;t have a daughter,&apos; I say. And there&apos;s an uncomfortable pause, as James looks at his wife as if they&apos;ve been found out. &apos;The designer did it,&apos; he says. But then, for all the Wisteria Lane-style decorative features, it&apos;s not America. And Californian style only works up to a point in a country with authoritarian social policies of the one-child-only variety. After the house, we tour the &apos;clubhouse&apos; across the road, with its bar, restaurant, gym and two swimming pools. &apos;Did you have a private swimming pool when you were young?&apos; I ask him jokingly. &apos;We were just so happy if we had something good to eat,&apos; he answers, but less jokingly. In the taxi back to central Shanghai I start thinking that although the house was expensive, it really wasn&apos;t that different from millions of suburban homes all across America. But then, that&apos;s Shanghai: from one angle it all looks quite &apos;normal&apos; - the bars, the shops, the fashionably dressed young folk - and yet from another, it&apos;s anything but. In the business centre of the Shangri La Hotel, not far from the construction site where the tallest skyscraper in the world is being built, I attempt to do a bit of research on the internet, but the server seems to be down. There&apos;s no Wikipedia, no BBC, no New York Times. And only then does the penny drop: I&apos;m behind the great firewall of China. I spend half an hour trying to establish what it is exactly the Chinese government doesn&apos;t want me to know and then, somehow, quite by accident, I slip through an electronic loophole and find an article by someone who&apos;d written something on a chatsite and was taken off to be &apos;re-educated&apos; in a labour camp. The hairs on the back of my neck prickle. I can&apos;t help wondering if there&apos;s somebody watching. But then, of course, there probably is. It&apos;s one thing knowing about the one-child policy in theory, quite another seeing it in action. The present crop of twentysomethings is a demographic freak, a generation consisting predominantly of only children. With everything that implies: it&apos;s why China has the highest number of mobile-phone users in the world, why western brands are salivating at the riches to come, and why, in every glamorous bar in town, I seem to meet a young girl who refers to herself as a &apos;Shanghai princess&apos;. Yuan Yuan, the events organiser with the mobile-phone billionaire friend, is not a Shanghai princess - she&apos;s in her thirties, defiantly independent and single - but she knows Shanghai princesses and rounds up a bunch of them for us, along with a couple of princes. They&apos;re all such polite young things, articulate, interesting, with good jobs at western firms. And encouragingly, only one of them, Tim, is dressed head to toe in designer labels. &apos;Talk me through your outfit, Tim,&apos; I say, and Yuan Yuan translates: &apos;The sunglasses are YSL. The jacket&apos;s Vivienne Westwood. This necklace is Dolce and Gabbana. The bracelet is Cartier. The gold chains are Dior Homme. This is a Gucci bag, Gucci key ring, Gucci belt...&apos; &apos;And how much did it cost?&apos; &apos;The outfit... at least 300,000 RMB. But he doesn&apos;t like the logos, he just likes the style.&apos; (It&apos;s not until later that I check the exchange rate: \u00a320,000! That&apos;s not an outfit, it&apos;s a car.) Finally, I attempt to ask them about politics. &apos;Ask anything you like!&apos; they say. &apos;We are the new generation, we&apos;re allowed to talk about it. Western people think that we are all heavily controlled by the government. But we don&apos;t really feel like that.&apos; &apos;Does anyone ever criticise the government?&apos; I ask, pointing out that they can talk to me with the assurance of strict anonymity. &apos;Of course,&apos; says someone I&apos;ll call Lily. &apos;They say the government is hiding stuff. That they don&apos;t tell the truth.&apos; &apos;And do you agree with this?&apos; &apos;Sometimes,&apos; she says. &apos;Actually, the media is not really controlled by the government,&apos; says &apos;Pete&apos;. &apos;We can get a lot of information over the internet.&apos; &apos;And what about democracy?&apos; I say. &apos;Hmm? Any thoughts on that?&apos; &apos;We can vote for representatives. But our problem in China is that we have too many people. It&apos;s impossible for us to have true democracy. The country is too big,&apos; says George. They could be reading off a script entitled something like Young People in China Don&apos;t Give a Stuff About Politics. But they really don&apos;t. &apos;What about human rights?&apos; I say, a plaintive note rising in my voice. &apos;Like detaining prisoners without trial. Like torture.&apos; &apos;Like Guantanamo?&apos; says George. &apos;America has the same problem as us.&apos; It&apos;s a fair point, but largely a rhetorical one. They really aren&apos;t interested. They were toddlers at the time of Tiananmen - in their experience, Chinese policemen provide security at red-carpet events. And everybody&apos;s getting better off: industrial profits grew by 30 per cent in the first 10 months of last year, investment by 27 per cent in the same period. Total retail sales by 14.3 per cent - in just one month, October. Shanghai is building 400 new high-rises a year. Ten new cities are emerging on the city&apos;s outskirts, each of which will house more than 1m people. It&apos;s hardly surprising that China now consumes 40 per cent of the world&apos;s concrete and 90 per cent of its steel. These are astonishing times, and even among this group of young Burberry wearers you get a glimpse of how far the country has come, how quickly. I chat to one of the girls, idly, while we&apos;re doing the photos. She&apos;s wearing a raspberry cashmere sweater and designer leather boots. Her bag is by Chanel. She loves Chanel, she tells me. She loves shopping. Oh, blah blah, I think, and put down my notepad because, really, there&apos;s only so many conversations about designer handbags you can take. And then she mentions that she was brought up in Xinjiang, in the far, far northwest. Her parents were forcibly relocated there in the Seventies. &apos;They didn&apos;t want to go,&apos; she says. &apos;They were taken there and then left in the middle of the countryside. They had to build their own house. We were miles from anywhere - they wanted to keep us apart from the local people. The nearest village was a two-hour cycle ride away and it had nothing, only a little market.&apos; She lets out a little shiver of horror at the memory: &apos;There was no McDonald&apos;s, no KFC, no shops. There was no Chanel - I didn&apos;t even know about Chanel at the time.&apos; From rural to urban, from poverty to designer cashmere, her transformation has taken just over a decade. She&apos;s gone from grinding rural poverty to a good job with a western computer firm. With her immaculately groomed hair, her manicured nails and her fluent English, she is China in miniature. The economic miracle made flesh. By the end of my trip, I&apos;ve learnt so much about Chinese millionaires and billionaires. But it&apos;s an American woman I meet by chance in a bar who really drives it home. She&apos;s the vice president of the International Finance Corporation, the private investor arm of the World Bank. And when I&apos;m left slightly befuddled by her descriptions of capital markets and corporate governance and investment assets, she puts it very simply for me: &apos;These people are going to win. And they are going to win big.&apos; I give you the Shanghai princes and princesses. The masters of the universe of the future. Or China, as it&apos;s otherwise known.

She said, &apos;Don&apos;t let them take your picture in public.&apos; This is a result of the Cultural Revolution - she thinks you shouldn&apos;t draw attention to yourself. The Chinese way is to always be in the middle, never say yes or no, always say &apos;maybe&apos;. My parents were teenagers at the start of the Cultural Revolution and as all the universities were closed down, they couldn&apos;t get an education. So when I was old enough, they paid for me to study fashion PR at the London College of Fashion. My father hoped I could come back and help them, but I&apos;m not really interested in the fashion industry. Instead, I&apos;m trying to build up the first professional photographer&apos;s agency in Shanghai. My parents don&apos;t really approve of my lifestyle and there&apos;s this huge generation gap: my mother doesn&apos;t like me wearing make-up and she doesn&apos;t know I drink alcohol. They also worry that things could change again very quickly, just as they did with the Cultural Revolution. They also want to know when I&apos;m going to get married. I have a boyfriend, but it&apos;s not really long term. All my girlfriends are the same - except they have three or four boyfriends at the same time. They never commit to anyone until they marry. They say you have to tell men they have competition otherwise they think you are easy to get.

Qian Cui Fang (Hang&apos;s mother), 58, member of the neighbourhood committee The Cultural Revolution was the greatest disaster of my life. Before the civil war my grandparents had been landlords, so we were considered to be capitalists. I was very good at my studies, but I couldn&apos;t go to university. I was sent out to work in the fields; it was a very hard life. I became a tailor after that. Part of my job now is to enforce the one-child policy. Sometimes pregnant women come from the countryside to my compound, and we have to ring the authorities in the area they are from to see if they have a licence. If they don&apos;t, they are supposed to have an abortion, but it doesn&apos;t always happen. They sometimes run away. Michelle Ma, 35, marketing manager I&apos;ve been to this restaurant - Jade on 36 at the Shangri La Hotel - eight times now. Two years ago I&apos;d never even tasted a glass of wine or eaten western food, but now I&apos;m addicted to fine dining. My boyfriend and I go to restaurants at least once a week, and while many Chinese people probably think I&apos;m mad to spend \u00a3100 on a meal, for me it&apos;s as rewarding as going to the opera or the cinema. My lifestyle is very different to a lot of Chinese girls my age. My cousin, for example, loves to play mah jong and drink tea, just like our parents before us. If I&apos;m going to a restaurant for lunch and a glass of champagne, I would never call her, because I know she wouldn&apos;t enjoy it. We&apos;re very close - in China, cousins are often like sisters - but we are two different types of Chinese women. I hate mah jong. I just think it&apos;s a waste of time. My cousin&apos;s married, but none of my friends are. I&apos;m in the most stable relationship out of any of them. We all have foreign boyfriends. It&apos;s funny, because some of the western men go out with girls we consider really ugly.

It was an eloquent statement of its developing capacity to blind the entire American military system which is dependent on up to 200 satellites - and has sent a cold shiver down the spine of the Japanese, American and Taiwanese military establishments. If ever there is a war in Asia, this will be seen a critical moment. China is the second largest military power in the world; it spends more than Britain, Germany and France combined. And the spending is very targeted. China is building up the arsenal it would need to invade Taiwan and hold off an attempt by the Americans and Japanese to relieve it, igniting one of the world&apos;s great flash points. No other explanation is possible. China protests that it wants to continue to rise peacefully and does not want to disturb the current world order. It has renounced Maoism, proclaim Western intellectuals, and its aims are surely are capitalist economic growth not mounting invasions. Thus both its neighbours and the West comfort themselves. The problem is that China has only partially renounced Maoism; the apparatus of dictatorship and one-party rule remain firmly in place but with no viable ideology to justify it. It is a highly unstable, wasteful and inefficient system which is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain. The party&apos;s first claim to legitimacy is that so far it has worked. And its second claim to legitimacy is its appeal to Chinese nationalism. It is the custodian of a strong China that keeps foreigners at bay. Jobs and nationalism would be the only two pillars on which Chinese communism could sustain power, Deng Xiaoping told the party after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Deliver those and it might hold off political challenge. It has. Even Chinese history taught in schools plays up the threat from foreigners, eliminates any Chinese atrocities and emphasises the role of the party as China&apos;s saviour. Whenever it has suited the party&apos;s interest is has turned to nationalism; it raised 46 million e-signatures last year to oppose Japan winning a seat on the UN Security Council. Which brings us to Taiwan. This island off the Chinese coast has enormous iconic importance for China in general and the Communist party in particular. Of all the humiliations suffered during the 19th century, Japan&apos;s seizure of Taiwan as a colony in 1895 rankles most. To make matters worse, this is where Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Nationalist armies fled in 1949 to declare the &apos;true&apos; Republic of China, around which the US threw a mantle of protection. It is an ever-present ideological threat; proof that a Western-style economic and social model based on Enlightenment values could work on the mainland. China has never dropped its claim for sovereignty, in 2005 passing an anti-secession law which declared that if Taiwan attempted to gain full independent statehood China reserved the right to invade. If Taiwan had lost American military protection, China would have done so already: Deng sold the recapture of Taiwan as one of the aims of his reform programme, and the party wants to keep his promise. But time is running out. Within Taiwan the use of the local Minnan dialect has soared, displacing Mandarin. Only 3 per cent of Taiwanese now support any form of re-unification. Since 2000 the Democratic Progressive party, pledged to a fully-fledged independent Taiwanese state, has won two presidential elections. Beijing is increasingly concerned that the possibility of recovering of Taiwan is slipping away. An invasion would be high-risk. There is only operational airspace over Taiwan for 300 fourth-generation fighters; Taiwan has 300. It would take 1,000 landing craft up to a fortnight to move 30 infantry divisions across the Taiwan Strait - all the time exposed to American and Japanese retaliation. But if the US&apos;s command and control satellite network could be knocked out, suddenly the risks would be dramatically reduced. On top, the US is increasingly focusing its military effort in the Middle East. All China needs is a fortnight. Very few in Europe understand the Bismarkian, pre-1914 Europe feel to Asian great power politics. In February 2005, China issued an ultimatum to Japan over its occupation of the oil-rich Senkaku Islands; withdraw or face the consequences, sending a five-strong fleet to the islands. Japan responded by putting 55,000 men on alert. Both sides backed off. But China distrusts renascent Japanese nationalism, especially with Japan&apos;s now stated wish to change its pacifist constitution. Asia is a powder keg of competing nationalisms, battles for scarce energy resources and unresolved mutual enmities. China says it wants treaties - it claims to want a treaty to prevent the militarisation of space - while pursuing balance-of-power politics. It will block India and Japan winning seats on the UN Security Council, thereby guaranteeing the ongoing dysfunctionality of the UN. China is the rogue state par excellence, all the while claiming it is quite the opposite. Its unintended ally is George W Bush. China can make its plea for international treaties knowing that the unilateralist US will refuse. Bush then plays Bismarkian politics in Asia, backing Japan - but with dwindling military power. Talk of building a defence mechanism against a Chinese attack on American satellites is for the birds; the expense, given Iraq, and technological complexity make it impossible. The pass has been sold. China can do what it wants. If there is unrest within, the party will turn increasingly to nationalism and perhaps even war. It shows that every aspect of globalisation, from space to trade, has to be governed by international treaty and the rule of law. The US reaction to last week should not be a star-wars arms race, but to comprehend the new realities and to respond by multilateral engagement. It won&apos;t, so it is no longer scaremongering to warn of the small, but growing risk, of a devastating Asian war. \u00b7 Will Hutton&apos;s book, The Writing on the Wall (Time Warner, \u00a320), is out now"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/23/chinasnewwall", "publicationDate": "2007-01-23T14:03:03Z", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan also remains a potential flashpoint (though Hutton, unlike most commentators, recognises that Beijing has been restrained on this issue)."], "title": "A lesson well learnt", "article": "Will Hutton&apos;s new book on China - The Writing on the Wall - has been welcomed for taking a fresh and critical look at a country which attracts too much hyperbole. It is one of a new genre of China studies by non-China specialists, - which is no bad thing either. Hutton&apos;s analysis of China&apos;s hidden weaknesses is often sharp and to the point: but the advice he then offers to Beijing is more problematic. Hutton warns rightly against Western &quot;hyper-bullishness&quot; about the so-called Chinese miracle. The current system, he says, is a &quot;halfway house&quot;, beset by a shaky banking system and an economy dominated by the unseen hand of the Communist party. It is riven by corruption and reliant on exponential growth (at mounting social and environmental cost) to keep control. Anyone who has seen the proliferation of empty highways and lavish bank buildings across China can agree that there has been &quot;astonishing wastefulness&quot;. Anyone who has travelled down the Yangtze without once seeing the sun knows the price paid in pollution. Any supporter of Amnesty or Human Rights in China or the China Labour Bulletin will know the human cost of a political system which seems unable to evolve. And the rich-poor gap is typified by the way that the bicycle is being squeezed off city roads by the private car. &quot;Communist&quot; China has mounted the capitalist growth machine and cannot dismount. It was doubly unfortunate that China&apos;s entry to market reform, Hutton points out, should have coincided with the ascendance of the utopian free market philosophies under Reagan and Thatcher. Hutton insists that the present halfway house is unsustainable. It could be overthrown at any time by a severe shock such as &quot;a prolonged water shortage, a further increase in the price of oil, or unilateral tariff increases by the US&quot;. Taiwan also remains a potential flashpoint (though Hutton, unlike most commentators, recognises that Beijing has been restrained on this issue). Hutton&apos;s gloom, particularly on the lack of political reform and the persistence of social inequality, is justified though sometimes he fails to understand the subtlety of Chinese power relationships. The party committees set up in private enterprises, seen by him as a &quot;spider&apos;s web&quot; of control, may result instead in the party&apos;s values being subverted by those of business. Some of the political levers in what he calls the &quot;Leninist state&quot; are really the old system of guanxi (personal connections) in operation. The reason why personal saving is so high (and inhibits consumption) is largely because health and social security provision is so poor and people have to provide for their future. Hutton blames this on &quot;Leninist corporatism&quot; but are not inadequate social services equally a feature of the US today? So what is the answer to China&apos;s problems? Hutton urges the Chinese to embark on a transition to democracy and &quot;moral capitalism&quot; in which the market is underpinned by a &quot;soft infrastructure&quot; which guarantees human rights - including the rights of property and labour - equality and justice. Communism in China should give way to a enlightened state with pluralist institutions. Yet Hutton&apos;s intellectual rigour compels him to acknowledge that the model of enlightened capitalism which he presses on China is deeply flawed in the West. The US and Britain have allowed the social bargain between state and people to decay. Protectionism at the WTO and environmental neglect is a &quot;dereliction of (US) duty&quot; and the values of proper governance are being undermined in the fight against terrorism. He urges the US not to revert to protectionism nor provoke chauvinism in Beijing by opposing China&apos;s peaceful rise. When Donald Rumsfeld said he could not understand what enemy China had in mind in increasing its military spending, this was &quot;disingenuousness of the highest order.&quot; We should applaud Hutton&apos;s advocacy of higher values for China and for the west, and we should support the aspirations and efforts of millions of Chinese for a democratic society. But we should also ask how much China&apos;s difficulties really have to do with lack of democracy and how much they stem from the lessons of contemporary &quot;hard capitalism&quot; being learnt only too well. Just how effective will it be to advise the Chinese (as we already advising them on the environment) to do what we say, not what we do?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/jan/23/highereducation.research", "publicationDate": "2007-01-23T23:54:29Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Research", "Education", "UK news", "Autism"], "sentences": ["With this in mind, a growing number of researchers this year began fanning out across the Asian continent to collect new data and fine-tune their research tools in countries including China, India, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan."], "title": "Breaking down barriers", "article": "When many observers think of Korea today, missile tests and their effect on the world&apos;s geopolitical stability come to mind. But for one group of international researchers currently at work on the volatile peninsula, it&apos;s young Korean children stricken with terrible communication difficulties, who exhibit strange, obsessive behaviours, that warrant closer attention. The past decade has seen an unprecedented degree of activity in the research of autism spectrum disorders in Britain and the US, where more than $100m (\u00a350.7m) in new research grants has been made available in the past year alone for investigating this still-baffling neurological malady. And most researchers will argue that tangible results in understanding the condition have been achieved through the work, including a consensus that unknown genetic factors are its primary cause, and that its incidence is much higher than once thought. Asian research But successfully arguing for the new models of autism&apos;s wide prevalence and roots in human genes requires wider evidence from global sources. With this in mind, a growing number of researchers this year began fanning out across the Asian continent to collect new data and fine-tune their research tools in countries including China, India, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. The first academic cab off the rank has been a pilot project in South Korea led by a Washington anthropologist, Roy Richard Grinker, who has just published a new book on autism, and Young shin Kim, a Korean-born child psychiatrist? They have been joined by Eric Fombonne, the Canadian scholar responsible for the landmark epidemiological study which established that one in 166 young Britons are afflicted. Already the hurdles are becoming apparent. For one thing, autism research in Asia, with the exception of Japan, has been generally non-existent. But outside researchers are finding other barriers to their efforts, including a strong resistance to the emerging scholarly consensus in the Anglo-American world on autism&apos;s prevalence and causes among many of their Asian counterparts. Michael Hong, a professor of psychiatry at Seoul National University, who is sometimes described as South Korea&apos;s founding father of child psychiatry, is among those Asian researchers who dispute the growing consensus, arguing that autism is not nearly as prevalent as western researchers believe, perhaps afflicting just one youngster in every 10,000. Hong argues that behaviour that is often labelled as autism is rather a largely environmentally caused disorder that mimics autism, known as reactive attachment disorder, the cause of which is largely the fault of the children&apos;s mothers, who have been buffeted about by the winds of cultural change sweeping east Asia. &quot;They don&apos;t really appreciate what&apos;s happening here,&quot; Hong says of the western researchers. Those researchers are not only challenging Hong&apos;s hard-earned reputation, they are also flying in the face of culturally embedded Korean notions about the role of women and the nature of parenting. &quot;It&apos;s seen as a disease that impugns the whole family,&quot; explains Grinker, a professor of anthropology at George Washington University. The work of Grinker&apos;s seven-member team of investigators was made possible through a $120,000 grant from the New York-based Autism Speaks, a non-profit group with offices in Britain and America. The organisation has pledged $13m in new funding during the past year for studies such as the two-year-long South Korean venture, which will screen, assess and analyse data collected in Ilsan, a city of 200,000 near the capital, Seoul, in order to work out the country&apos;s autism prevalence. With its low labour costs and well-established medical networks, South Korea seemed a particularly inviting prospect for such a study, whose design has been modelled on the landmark British effort in Stafford. The new data will test the trustworthiness of existing estimates, which are based on US and British surveys of their respective populations. They will test whether those previous studies could have contained any in-built bias towards the Anglo-American situation. If, say, the incidence of autism in South Korea were found to be much lower than existing western studies suggest, the implications for British research could be tremendous. Grinker doesn&apos;t think that will happen. But, like Hong and Leo Kanner, the child psychiatrist who first described autism in 1943, he once believed that autism was a rare disorder. When his 15-year-old daughter, Isabel, was first diagnosed with the condition, in 1994, he knew almost nothing about it. Grinker says he has strived to improve his own knowledge and that of academia at large. During the same period, autism has surged into the popular consciousness on the back of a tidal wave of media coverage, parental activism and widely published findings showing that the condition once thought to affect as few as one in 10,000 children - Leo Kanner&apos;s number - affected as many as six in every 1,000. The results of Grinker&apos;s academic quest were published this month in Unstrange Minds: Remapping the World of Autism, which includes a long section detailing the Korean experience. &quot;Illusory&quot; academic ideas about autism, he complains, both reflect and shape the contemporary South Korean child psychiatry scene. Blaming the mother In such a setting, reactive attachment disorder is a popular diagnosis, Grinker believes, because the condition simply blames the mother: &quot;That&apos;s the more culturally appropriate diagnosis, you see, because it means there&apos;s just this one person - the mother - who&apos;s to blame.&quot; Kyung-jin Cho, a South Korean anthropologist involved with the project, says the researchers&apos; initial screenings are interested in identifying symptoms, which will then be considered as part of a lengthy procedure based on the best scientific understanding about the malady. Young shin Kim, an assistant professor at Yale University&apos;s School of Medicine and the project&apos;s other principal investigator, complains about the &quot;shared ignorance&quot; about autism, in a country served by just 70 trained child psychiatrists. Along with her colleagues, Kim points out that it has only been the new, higher and more accurate prevalence rates that have, in Britain and America, produced more and better educational services, earlier diagnosis, better treatment, less social stigma; indeed, just about everything children with autism need. When a prevalence rate is finally generated for South Korea, this could be the case there, too. &quot;That&apos;s the reason we&apos;re doing the study,&quot; she says. &quot;Children with autism-spectrum disorders in Korea have every right to live their life and be happy, too. And their Korean mothers and fathers need to have every opportunity to overcome fear and discrimination.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/jan/24/sydneycompanybuysuplocalu", "publicationDate": "2007-01-24T08:10:49Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "US press and publishing", "Oklahoma", "Sydney"], "sentences": ["Macquarie owns 85 Australian regional radio licences and has a 60% interest in a pay-TV provider in Taiwan."], "title": "Sydney company buys up local US newspapers", "article": "The Sydney-based investment fund, Macquarie Media Group, has acquired a group of 40 US newspapers in Texas and Oklahoma.

Even for a UN career noted for vision, commitment and publications of the highest quality, this was an exceptionally fruitful period. At Unctad, Patel&apos;s collaborators included Amartya Sen - a later Nobel economics laureate - Charles Cooper, Frances Stewart and KK Subrahmanian. His work changed and deepened understanding of the central role of technology in development, drawing attention to how technology was actually transferred to developing countries, to the crucial links with the intellectual property system and the importance of developing countries establishing strong institutions and policies of their own, backed up by supportive technical assistance. Patel also worked on a draft code of conduct for the transfer of technology, especially to less developed countries with few patents of their own. But after a decade or more of negotiations, the code was defeated by the industrial countries and a coalition of transnational corporations fighting to protect their patents. All this was 30 years ahead of the battles which have finally allowed South Africa and other African countries to import generic retroviral medicines to combat HIV/Aids. Had Patel&apos;s ideas been accepted, these battles and the delays in poor people obtaining treatment might never have occurred. Born in Gujarat, Patel grew up in rural India in the final days of the Raj, obtaining a string of scholarships and fellowships. These eventually took him to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied with the Nobel economist Simon Kuznets and obtained his doctorate under the supervision of the distinguished agricultural economist, Daniel Thorner. Patel&apos;s thesis focused on the social evolution of agricultural society in India and Pakistan, with particular attention to income development and distribution. He also wrote on Keynes and Marx&apos;s contributions to economic thought. He joined the UN in 1950, when the organisation&apos;s headquarters was still at Lake Success, New York state, working with Michal Kalecki on the World Economic Survey. Soon afterwards, he was refused a visa to return to the US after home leave in India. This was the period when many UN personnel were targets of the McCarthyite witchhunt in the US, and Patel&apos;s case became a cause celebre in his homeland. Washington relented after six months, though restrictions were still imposed on Patel&apos;s movements. A brief stint in the Indian planning commission was followed by longer periods in the UN economic commissions for Africa and then for Asia and the Far East. Then came Unctad. In all these posts Patel generated intellectual excitement and warmth in personal relations - and inspired many younger people. He was one of the most boldest and most far sighted of UN economists. After his retirement, he worked at the South commission in Geneva and with the UN World Institute of Development Economic Research (Wider). He was also a visiting professor at several universities, including the Gandhian Sardar Patel Institute of Economic and Social Research in Ahmedabad and Saint Mary&apos;s University in Halifax, Canada. In contrast to many practitioners of economics and of development, there was always a strong note of optimism and positive challenge in Patel&apos;s economic work and writing, clearly evident in an Economic Journal article in 1964, The Economic Distance Between Nations: Its Origin, Measurement and Outlook. This measured the distance between countries as the number of years it had taken for one country to catch up to the position of another. It showed that late starters generally took fewer years to reach the position of the early industrialised countries than the early industrialisers had taken to get there. Moreover, the later the start, the quicker the catch up. Patel&apos;s point was not that there was any inexorable law requiring such growth but that historical evidence showed how accelerated development by the developing countries was both possible and desirable. Written more than 40 years ago - well before Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and other developing countries had demonstrated such potential, let alone China and India - the approach was prescient. Moreover, Patel argued, accelerated development was needed to tackle the new form of inequality that was impressing itself upon &quot;the conscience of advanced thinkers&quot;, namely the vast gap in levels of living that divides rich and poor countries. Over the years, Patel elaborated this theme - arguing that the educational and technological distance between nations could and should be narrowed - though he recognised there was no single or simple measure of technological distance between countries, nor any one action required. Later, he explored these issues further - with Krishna Ahooja-Patel and Mahesh, his son - in relation to gender inequality and other actions to reduce the social distance in health, literacy and child literacy. One of Patel&apos;s last contributions was a five-volume collection, Technological Transformation in the Third World, completed in 1995 and dealing with the industrial countries as well as with Asia, Latin America and Africa. Although Patel explored the widening development distance within the south, he entitled the last part of the final volume Looking to the Future With Hope. This remained his vision and commitment. Patel is survived by his first wife Ruth Gainsborough, his second wife Krishna Ahooja-Patel, his companion in later years Claire Galez and his three sons, Mahesh, Shail and Samir. \u00b7 Surendra J Patel, economist, born September 21 1923; died December 13 2006"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jan/24/china.international", "publicationDate": "2007-01-24T11:38:25Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["It has only exacerbated the problem, but that is not to say that having this policy has necessarily caused the large imbalance.&quot; He said South Korea, Taiwan and Pakistan had similar problems even though they lacked China&apos;s severe controls."], "title": "Gender imbalance in China could take 15 years to correct", "article": "It could take 15 years for China&apos;s gender imbalance to sort itself out, the country&apos;s top family planner said yesterday, admitting that three decades of strict population policies had contributed to the problem. In 2005 118 boys were born for every 100 girls born in China, as wider use of ultrasound scans and the easy availability of abortions exacerbated the preference for boys. In some areas the ratio is 130 to 100. &quot;There are many reasons for the gender imbalance, and the first is the existence for thousands of years of a deep-rooted traditional view that men are worth more than women,&quot; Zhang Weiqing, head of the National Population and Family Planning Commission, told a news conference. &quot;Of course, there is a certain relationship between the imbalance and China&apos;s strict family planning policy ... It has only exacerbated the problem, but that is not to say that having this policy has necessarily caused the large imbalance.&quot; He said South Korea, Taiwan and Pakistan had similar problems even though they lacked China&apos;s severe controls. Mr Zhang said the government would make more effort to raise women&apos;s place in society and protect baby girls - with rewards, such as retirement pensions, for parents who have girls - as well as to crack down on illegal gender selection tests and sex-selective abortions. &quot;Solving this issue is rather difficult, and we may have to wait 10 to 15 years for the proportion to balance out.&quot; China, which has 1.3 billion citizens, last year scrapped plans to make sex-selective abortion a crime. Experts have said such a step would better deter parents from aborting girls. Mr Zhang defended the population plan - which he said had halted 400m births in 30 years - and said it was wrong to call the programme a &quot;one-child&quot; policy. The reality was more complex, he said, with different provinces making their own adjustments as the situation demanded. Only just over a third of the population was limited to just one child. In 19 provinces rural couples were allowed to have another baby if their first was a girl, the minister said.

More than 10,000 investors turned up at the city&apos;s Olympiahalle to assail the group&apos;s executive and supervisory boards for doing too little too late to investigate allegations that senior managers created secret slush funds to bribe overseas officials to award telecoms contrtacts - and for the poor showing of Siemens shares. But the group&apos;s stock rose more than 6% after Siemens announced, just before the annual meeting, a 51% jump in operating profits in the first quarter, the $3.5bn (\u00a31.77bn) acquisition of Texan digital automation company UGS and plans to float off a minority stake in its profitable VDO car components business. &quot;These figures and the scale of the transactions indicate clearly that Siemens has reached a turning-point,&quot; Henning Gebhardt, head of equities at Germany&apos;s biggest fund manager, DWS, told the Guardian. &quot;The planned IPO (initial public offering) of VDO is a rare sign that it is properly managing its portfolio and floating off a division when it is making money and not in crisis.&quot; Mr Gebhardt, whose DWS has \u00801bn invested in Siemens, had been one of several disgruntled institutional and small investors to criticise the board for failing to deal with the strategic growth of the group and appearing to reel from one crisis to another. Daniela Bergdolt, head of small shareholders group DSW, asked how a company renowned for its solid reliability had been forced to react belatedly to a spate of bad headlines, leaving the impression the board was incapable of running the business. Mr Gebhardt said Siemens had become so complex the executive board could no longer control the whole business.  But concerted moves to refuse to approve the two boards&apos; actions in the past year evaporated after Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, announced he had withdrawn from the audit committee investigating the bribery scandal to avoid any conflict of interest over events which took place when he was chief executive. Visibly contrite, he expressed &quot;deep distress&quot; that efforts he had instigated to ensure full compliance with corporate governance codes had failed but demanded that all suspects be considered innocent before being found guilty. Klaus Kleinfeld, chief executive, promised to restore Siemens&apos; exemplary reputation as a world leader in corporate governance and regain investor trust. &quot;There is no place for crooked business practice in our company and that principle is non-negotiable,&quot; he said to loud applause while admitting that some of the allegations would prove to be true. Gerhard Cromme, audit committee chairman and architect of Germany&apos;s corporate governance code, also assuaged investor anxiety by promising that Siemens&apos; own inquiries would go far beyond the investigations begun by state prosecutors in mid-November. &quot;Our goal is clear: to have in place a system that will prevent and detect unethical and illegal conduct and serve as a benchmark for other companies,&quot; he said.  Shareholder ire turned instead to auditors KPMG for failing to detect the holes in Siemens&apos; accounts caused by the alleged use of slush funds to win overseas contracts through bribery, with several questioning how much longer one of the Big Four firms could continue to be appointed. Siemens had earlier regained shareholder confidence by announcing that its first-quarter operating profit soared to \u00801.63bn on sales up 6% to \u008019bn and orders up 4% to \u008025.6bn. The company, also assailed over executive pay rises and the abortive disposal of its now-bankrupt mobile phones business to Taiwan&apos;s BenQ, said net income fell 16% to \u0080788m because of the \u0080433m impact of fines imposed by the European commission on Wednesday for leading a cartel in equipment for electricity sub-stations. Mr Kleinfeld, hailing a &quot;good start&quot; to the financial year, said Siemens plannd to float off more than 25% of VDO and insisted that the group&apos;s divisions would hit his April deadline for reaching his tough profit margins. \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/jan/26/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1", "publicationDate": "2007-01-26T11:48:48Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["Although China offers no threat at present, the fear is that if there were a stand-off over Taiwan, the Chinese might be tempted by the option of destroying US satellites."], "title": "China flexes its muscle", "article": "China faced a barrage of international condemnation last week after it was revealed that it had launched a missile attack on its own ageing weather satellite, a test that threatened to open a Star Wars space race. Formal protests were lodged with the Beijing government, accompanied by expressions of concern from world leaders. The Bush administration is privately seething over the event and is believed to be preparing to turn the incident into a major diplomatic spat. The concern in the US is that the satellite-killing missile test - said by the US national security council to have been carried out on January 11 - demonstrated that China has the capability to knock out its military satellite system. American military and diplomatic analysts said a Chinese attack on about 40 to 50 satellites in low orbit around the world would leave the country&apos;s military blinded within a matter of hours. But others, more sceptical about US policy, insist that China had a right to challenge the US&apos;s effective monopoly of space. They noted that Beijing has repeatedly pressed the US to sign agreements outlawing arms in space, overtures Washington has repeatedly rejected. A Chinese government spokesman, Liu Jianchao, confirmed that the missile strike had taken place. &quot;This test was not directed at any country and does not constitute a threat to any country,&quot; he told a crowded news briefing. Secrecy shrouds the rocket that is believed to have delivered the kinetic anti-satellite bomb. The KT2 was exhibited in Zhuhai in 2002 as a &quot;civilian launch system&quot; but has not been seen since. According to Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, the first to report the test, the anti-satellite system was launched from or near the Xichang space centre in Sichuan province. The Russian government, which claims to favour demilitarisation of space, expressed doubts about the nature of the test, claiming it was only a rumour that it was a demonstration of an anti-satellite capability. But the US, Britain, Japan, Australia and other countries had no doubts. A spokesman for the British government, while acknowledging that China had broken no treaties, protested last week arguing that the test was &quot;inconsistent&quot; with Beijing&apos;s earlier assurances to the UN on the military use of space, and would add to the space debris problem. The destruction of the Chinese satellite was the first such attack in space since the US carried out a similar test in 1985, when Ronald Reagan was pursuing the Star Wars anti-missile defence programme. The US, which has been trying to establish a closer relationship with China, has been reluctant recently to criticise Beijing, but last Thursday it lodged a formal protest. Relations between the US and China have been improving since a stand-off in 2001 when a US surveillance aircraft was forced to land on Hainan island. Although China offers no threat at present, the fear is that if there were a stand-off over Taiwan, the Chinese might be tempted by the option of destroying US satellites. Worry was also expressed by China&apos;s near neighbours, Japan and South Korea. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: &quot;We must use space for peace. We are asking the Chinese government about the test.&quot; The test has come as &quot;a bit of a nasty shock&quot;, according to Kerry Brown, China expert at the international affairs thinktank Chatham House, in London. Politically, it is a sign that China will be extending its commercial and economic power to more military areas, he said. Desmond Butler of AP writes: Joseph Biden, the chairman of the Senate&apos;s foreign relations committee, warned against fostering an arms race in space last weekend. Mr Biden, a Democrat, called the test provocative, but said the US had ways of combatting the threat posed by the Chinese test. &quot;I don&apos;t think we should be overly worried about this at this point,&quot; he told Fox News. &quot;We have ways to deal with that ability.&quot; Mr Biden said that President Bush&apos;s policy on weapons in space needed to be reviewed. In October Mr Bush signed an order asserting the US&apos;s right to deny adversaries access to space for hostile purposes. As part of the first revision of US space policy in nearly 10 years, the policy also said that Washington would oppose the development of treaties that sought to limit US access to or use of space. &quot;This is not the direction we want to go, in escalating competition in space. And we should be talking about it,&quot; Mr Biden said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/26/china", "publicationDate": "2007-01-26T12:42:01Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Davos", "Business", "Davos 2007", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In the public sessions in Davos, China&apos;s leaders have been at pains to argue that their country is not an economic superpower and that China&apos;s foreign policy - Taiwan apart - will remain low profile."], "title": "Davos 07: will China upset the apple cart?", "article": "There are two ways of looking at the impact of China on the world&apos;s geo-politics. The first is to look at China&apos;s economic strengths and weaknesses - it is rich in labour but poor in natural resources - and conclude that it is in Beijing&apos;s interests for the status quo to continue. If you are reliant on the rest of the world to supply your oil, the raw materials for your factories and - increasingly - the food to feed your population - the argument is that it makes absolutely no sense to upset the global apple cart. Peace and stability create the only conditions in which strong economic growth can be guaranteed. China, in other words, will pursue the same sort of strategy followed by Germany and - an even closer parallel - Japan in the years after the Second world War. But that is a bit of a glib parallel. Germany and Japan were both traumatised by crushing military defeat; China is re-merging as a global power after two centuries in which it has punched well below its weight on the international stage. China&apos;s economic emergence, coupled with the relative economic decline of Europe, means that we may be going through a re-run of the late 19th and early 20th Century when the European balance of power was disrupted by Germany. In the public sessions in Davos, China&apos;s leaders have been at pains to argue that their country is not an economic superpower and that China&apos;s foreign policy - Taiwan apart - will remain low profile. Privately, though, there is evidence of muscles being flexed. China, for example, is not prepared to cede military hegemony in space to the US, and on the economic front occasionally hints that it may diversify its huge foreign currency reserves out of dollars. At present, it is not in China&apos;s interests to blow the US economy out of the water, but once China has, say, 20 more years of export-led growth it may be a differrent story. So, in the short-term, China is not going to upset the apple cart. In the longer run, as Zhou Enlai replied when asked to assess the impact of the French Revolution - it&apos;s too early to say."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/27/europesdistantmirror", "publicationDate": "2007-01-27T10:30:00Z", "tags": ["European Union", "Germany", "China", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The only exception to this, of course, would be a declaration of independence from Taiwan, which the Chinese would consider a casus belli."], "title": "Europe's distant mirror", "article": "It is tempting for Europeans to project their own history onto Asia and to view current developments there as a mere repetition, if not an imitation, of what occurred in Europe. In fact, Asians themselves encourage this temptation, with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) openly aiming to become increasingly like the European Union. In trying to decipher Asia&apos;s diplomatic future, Europeans are confronted, so to speak, with an &quot;embarrassment of riches.&quot; Is Asia today replaying the balance of power games of late 19th century Europe, with China in the role of Germany? Or is South Asia, through the growth of ASEAN, poised to one day become the far eastern equivalent of the EU? These comparisons are not neutral, and one may detect in the analogy between China today and 19th century Germany an element of that guilty pleasure in others&apos; troubles that the Germans call &quot;Schadenfreude&quot;. Asia may be doing well economically now, according to this view, but just wait: rising nationalism, China&apos;s appetite for power, and the rest of Asia&apos;s desire to curb its ambitions will necessarily impede economic growth and restore the west&apos;s global primacy. But this scenario does not correspond to reality. China at the beginning of the 21st century is not Bismarck&apos;s newly unified Germany in the second half of the 19th century. The Chinese do not view themselves as a rising new power, but instead as Asia&apos;s traditional power, now experiencing a renaissance. China, they believe, is regaining the status and prestige that it enjoyed until the end of the 18th century. As a result, unlike Wilhelmine Germany, the Chinese are not in a hurry to prove how strong and powerful they have become. In strategic terms, China is not a revisionist power, but instead a &quot;satisfied,&quot; status-quo power. The only exception to this, of course, would be a declaration of independence from Taiwan, which the Chinese would consider a casus belli. To be sure, the Chinese are indeed rearming - and even entering the military space race - but they are doing so at a pace and to a proportion that reflects their new economic prosperity. China&apos;s fundamental priorities remain economic, reflecting its leaders&apos; belief that their regime&apos;s long-term survival presupposes the continuation of rapid growth. For that, they need access to energy, but they are not about to engage in military or even diplomatic adventures. Nor are they set to become a benevolent, altruistic power, ready to use their new strength and reputation to improve the stability of the international system. Chinese cynicism and spontaneous selfishness, however, is now tempered by what they perceive as growing recognition of their unique status. The combination of respect and interest they see in the way the world now views China can only reinforce their sense of confidence. So why should they take unnecessary risks? The resounding success of the Africa-China summit, which was attended by more African leaders than purely African gatherings; the diplomatic rapprochement between India and Japan; and the democratic alliance in the making between India, Japan, and Australia can only be interpreted as signs of China&apos;s newly regained position. Why would they jeopardise such real and symbolic gains with rash and untested moves? There is no Bismarck at the helm of Chinese diplomacy, but there is no impetuous Kaiser either: just relatively prudent and competent technocrats. In reality, what may threaten the stability of the region, and above all that of China, is not an excess of Chinese ambitions or a failure to democratise, but the Chinese regime&apos;s inability to establish the rule of law. In 1978, China&apos;s newly installed leader, Deng Xiaoping, viewed Singapore as living proof of the superiority of capitalism over communism. He remembered the impoverished backwater that Singapore was in the 1920&apos;s, and now he saw the gleaming city that free enterprise - together with Lee Kwan Yew&apos;s quasi-authoritarian leadership - had wrought. It was after visiting Singapore that Deng introduced &quot;special economic zones&quot; in southern China. But the rule of law, even Singapore-style, is far harder to implement than capitalism, and its absence represents the major obstacle to the establishment of an Asian community based on the EU model. Twenty years ago, one of the main obstacles to creating an Asian Union was Japan - Asia&apos;s most advanced and successful country, but one that did not feel Asian. Moreover, the rest of Asia resented the Japanese for revelling in this difference. That resentment remains, sustained in part by historical grievances, but the Japanese have now come to perceive themselves as Asians, helped by their realisation that the economic miracle that they initiated in the region has gone well beyond them. In Europe, transcending nationalism required not only two devastating world wars in the first half of the 20th century, but also the prevalence of democratic regimes. The rule of law is the equivalent for Asia today of what democracy was for Europe yesterday. Without its gradual imposition, an Asian Union could at best remain only a pale and hollow copy of its European model. \u00a9 Project Syndicate, 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/feb/01/art.artnews", "publicationDate": "2007-02-01T11:26:50Z", "tags": ["Banksy", "Street art", "UK news", "Art", "The art market", "Culture", "Art and design", "Claude Monet"], "sentences": ["Then there are the more recent buyers of art from Russia and south-east Asia, people living in Taiwan and Hong Kong and, increasingly, mainland China."], "title": "From Monet to Banksy: richest art sale could net \u00a3200m", "article": "It is being billed as the richest art sale Europe has ever seen, and will bring together impressionists, surrealists and even the graffiti artist Banksy. Some significant deaths and a buoyant art market - which shows no sign of cooling down - have joined to create a series of sales estimated to be worth over \u00a3200m to be held over four days at Sotheby&apos;s next week. It means that those with huge amounts of disposable cash, from Russian oligarchs to City bonus boys, will be converging on the auction house in New Bond Street, London, to take part in sales which are a who&apos;s who of impressionist and modern artists. There are Degas, Renoir, Pissarro, Monet, Gauguin, Modigliani, Picasso and Soutine. There are the surrealists, Magritte, Ernst, Duchamp, Dali and Masson. The Germans and Austrians are represented by Schiele, Kandinsky, Nolde and Meidner. Contemporary art comes from Warhol, Richter, Bacon, Lichtenstein, Basquiat, Riley. And the newer boys and girls, Doig, Banksy, Hirst and Ofili. There is so much to display in fact that from Saturday, for the first time, a huge marquee will be erected in Hanover Square Gardens, London, to show some of the more cutting edge, recent works. Helen Perkins, a deputy director at Sotheby&apos;s, is responsible for the marquee. &quot;It is very exciting. It will be very contemporary with wooden floors and lots of white walls and feel much more relaxed than a normal viewing.&quot; Ms Perkins admitted it could feel a little intimidating coming into the New Bond Street galleries and the marquee, showing artists from Banksy to German photographers Thomas Struth and Thomas Ruff, would be much more accessible. Philip Hook, a specialist in impressionist and modern art, said the strength of the sales - eight of them over four days from February 5 - confirmed London&apos;s important place in the world art market. &quot;The market is extremely strong and a lot of really good pictures are coming on to the market because owners rightly perceive it to be so good.&quot; Mr Hook said it was still the permanently rich who were competing in the top echelons of the market. In the \u00a350,000-\u00a3500,000 spectrum new buyers from the City, the hedge fund beneficiaries, were driving up prices. Then there are the more recent buyers of art from Russia and south-east Asia, people living in Taiwan and Hong Kong and, increasingly, mainland China. Mr Hook admitted that cold winters and warm summers were good for business - the cold means more people die and their art is sold while buyers pay more money for hot landscapes. &quot;The better the weather the higher the price when it comes to impressionist art,&quot; he said as he stood beside Claude Monet&apos;s Bordighera, La M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, a quintessential impressionist painting with its dazzling light and stunning garden which the artist once described as paradise. This Monet, painted in 1884, will set buyers back by between \u00a32.5m and \u00a33.5m. Nearby is La Route Rouge Pres de Menton painted by Monet close to the Italian border. &quot;There are a lot of Russians in Monaco,&quot; Mr Hook mused. At the core of the main impressionist and modern sale are three fabulously colourful works from the collection of the late Charles R Lachman, a founding partner of the cosmetics company Revlon. They are Renoir&apos;s Les Deux Soeurs (\u00a36m-\u00a38m), a wonderfully intimate example of impressionist portraiture, Maurice de Vlaminck&apos;s Symphonie en Couleurs (Fleurs) (\u00a31.5m-\u00a32.5m) and Raoul Dufy&apos;s vibrant painting of a Breton street market La Foire aux Oignons (\u00a31.2m-\u00a31.8m). Another highlight is works from the collection of Americans Paul and Mary Haas, including a work by Alfred Sisley expected to create a world record price for the artist. Le Loing \u00e0 Moret, en Et\u00e9, a landscape which Sotheby&apos;s believes shows Sisley at his best, should fetch between \u00a31.8m and \u00a32.5m. Then there are works from another major collection, from the estate of Herbert and Nell Singer, including a powerful example of Amedeo Modigliani&apos;s early portraiture, Portrait du Peintre Rouveyre (\u00a31.4m-\u00a31.8m). In another room Cheyenne Westphal, Sotheby&apos;s chairman of contemporary art, is looking at Frank Auerbach&apos;s Camden Theatre in the Rain. &quot;I don&apos;t want to jinx it but we feel Auerbach is the next one to make the big leap upwards,&quot; she said. Ms Westphal is speaking in the context of an art market which has seen British painters such as Bridget Riley and Peter Doig break the million pound barrier. In a separate room from Auerbach which was still being set up yesterday - works by Chris Ofili and Anish Kapoor were still shouting look at me from their packing cases - a painting some regard as Doig&apos;s best work dominated the room. White Canoe has been owned and exhibited by Charles Saatchi, who is presumed to be the seller. It is based on a still from Friday the 13th - the setting is serene and calm but lurking beneath the water is a serial killer. You could have bought a Doig for a few thousand pounds in the early 1990s.

But not all Texans have shared the sentiment. Indeed, the US is in mourning over the passing of a Texan who thought the British prime minister a bit too willing to play the poodle in his relationship with the American president. Molly Ivins, the wisecracking veteran journalist from the Lone Star State and the most widely-circulated liberal columnist in the United States, succumbed Wednesday evening at age 62 to what she referred to as &quot;a scorching case of cancer&quot;. That cancer silenced the Bush administration&apos;s sharpest critic at precisely the moment when the rest of the US media is finally rising from bended knee to challenge the president. It also removed from the American discourse one of the few popular commentators who regularly reported on - and frequently reported from - Britain. Ivins, a small &quot;r&quot; republican, took her shots at regal Brits, just as she did regal Americans, in a column that appeared in almost 400 newspapers several times a week. But she was, like most American liberals, a bit of an anglophile. And she let it be known that she expected an Oxford-educated prime minister, especially one from the Labour Party, to give foreign policy cues to the untraveled and incurious president she anointed Shrub. She would be disappointed. Aghast at the British leader&apos;s inexplicable willingness to go along with Bush&apos;s invasion and occupation of Iraq, Ivins labeled him &quot;Tony Blair, the first casualty of the war&quot;. And as the full folly of that war became evident, and as Blair continued to follow Bush&apos;s march into the quagmire, Ivins took to teasing the isolated leaders as &quot;the Axis of Feeble&quot;. Ivins had expected more from Blair, who she assumed would recognize his American friend&apos;s frailties, even if the prime minister might have had a hard time comprehending what she referred to as her fellow Texan&apos;s &quot;eccentric grasp of English&quot;. Reporting on the first 100 days of Bush&apos;s presidency, the columnist ticked off a long list of missteps and misdeeds - &quot;gratuitously went out of his way to pronounce the Kyoto treaty dead,&quot; &quot;needlessly and uselessly enraged the Chinese through ignorance of Taiwan policy&quot; - and then noted: &quot;On the plus side, after his first meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain, Bush said, &apos;we both use Colgate toothpaste.&apos; The Brits spent weeks trying to decipher the meaning of that remark.&quot; When Bush finally began meeting with foreign leaders, Ivins informed her readers that there was &quot;a joke making the rounds in Europe: Bush, Tony Blair, and Jacques Chirac are holding an economic summit. While Chirac maunders on about something, Bush leans over and says to Blair, &apos;The trouble with the French is that they have no word for entrepreneur.&apos;&quot; At the time, she assumed that Blair would gently set the president straight on such matters. Eventually, however, the caustic commentator came to the conclusion that the prime minister was aiding and abetting the president. A respected journalist who worked for many years as a New York Times bureau chief - finally writing her way out of the job when she referred to a &quot;community chicken-killing festival&quot; in a small town as a &quot;gang-pluck&quot; - Ivins wrote columns that drew on the absurdities of politics in her native Texas. And when the most absurd Texan of all became president, she found that tens of millions of Americans wanted her take on the new commander-in-chief. She did so in the form of what remains the best biography of the president: Shrub: The Short But Happy Political Life of George W Bush (written with her friend Lou Dubose). She could have settled into an easy career of Bush bashing. Instead, frustrated by the a White House press corps that she said was characterized by &quot;no principle, no guts, no grace&quot;, Ivins kept investigating and reporting - often, in the months after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, providing the only skeptical assessment of the president to appear in newspapers across the country. Ivins traveled to Britain to find fodder for her columns, and she was the first prominent US journalist to write extensively and aggressively about the so-called Downing Street Memo. &quot;I read some of the European press and most of the liberal publications in this country. I read the [New York] Times, the [Washington] Post, the Wall Street Journal and several Texas papers every day. It&apos;s my job,&quot; she informed readers. &quot;But when I read the first Downing Street Memo, my eyes bugged out and my jaw fell open. I could not believe what I was reading.&quot; To her, the evidence of collusion between the Bush administration and Blair&apos;s aides to assure that &quot;intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy&quot; of attacking Iraq was &quot;the smoking gun&quot; and she wrote the hell out of the story in a series of columns. For many Americans, living in communities where their local media reported little or nothing about the memo, Ivins&apos;s columns were revelations. As she noted, &quot;The memo was a huge story in Britain, but is almost unreported here.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know if these memos represent an impeachable offense,&quot; she wrote. &quot;But they strike me as a hell of lot worse than anything Richard Nixon ever contemplated. He used the government for petty political vindictiveness. Heck, I&apos;d settle for that again, over what we&apos;re looking at now.&quot; To be precise, Molly Ivins was referring to impeaching Bush, not Blair. She was, however, an equal opportunity pummeler of the powerful. And those Brits who have entertained the notion of pummeling their prime minister should know that Molly Ivins would have delighted in the process - especially if the pummeling came in debate. &quot;As one of those slow-spoken Americans often out-tap-danced on panels by the nimble-tongued Brits,&quot; Ivins once observed, &quot;I defensively assert they don&apos;t really think faster and better than we do - they just talk faster and better.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/feb/02/highereducation.uk1", "publicationDate": "2007-02-02T12:18:32Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "UK news", "Business", "Science"], "sentences": ["Developed countries like Japan and Germany are closing in fast and there are important new contenders in the emerging economies in terms of intellectual excellence.&quot; Using China, South Korea, Taiwan and Brazil as examples of such contenders, Mr Lambert will add: &quot;The UK remains outstanding in most biology and biomedical fields, but performance in chemistry, engineering, physics is relatively weak, and deteriorating."], "title": "CBI urges action over decline in science funding", "article": "Britain has under-invested in science for 30 years and risks being overtaken by international competitors unless it urgently reverses the decline, employers will warn today.

But there is a lot of ground to make up and a tough spending round to come. &quot;There is a moral responsibility, in a globalising world with intensifying competition from low cost economies, to recognise the future for people without competitive skills is bleak. The UK has to put more vitality, more energy, more investment into science and innovation.&quot; Mr Lambert will say the UK is well placed to make breakthroughs and advances in research and innovation because it has a strong, cooperative, multidisciplinary community of scientists and companies. Universities are also playing changing roles in city, regional and national economies. Higher education has expanded massively and there has been a culture change among academics who are now more willing to work outside Britain. Institutions are also now run by professional leaders with new visions of the role of universities, Mr Lambert will say. &quot;Our cities are back after decades of languishing in politicians&apos; problem pile. In the last half dozen years they have been recognised as critical to solving some of the UK&apos;s toughest social and economic problems.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/05/china.international", "publicationDate": "2007-02-05T00:03:39Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Grenada", "Taiwan", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A diplomatic gaffe marred the inauguration of a China-financed stadium in Grenada when a band performed Taiwan&apos;s national anthem.", "Chinese ambassador Qian Hongshan and scores of Chinese workers who built the new \u00a320m Queen&apos;s Park stadium as a gift from Beijing were visibly uncomfortable as Taiwan&apos;s anthem echoed inside the 20,000-seat venue on Saturday.", "Describing it as a blunder, Grenada&apos;s prime minister, Keith Mitchell, pledged an investigation into how the Royal Grenada Police Band could have prepared the anthem of Taiwan instead of China."], "title": "Band plays Taiwan's anthem for Chinese", "article": "A diplomatic gaffe marred the inauguration of a China-financed stadium in Grenada when a band performed Taiwan&apos;s national anthem.

He has just conducted his Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra in a scintillating programme of Berlioz, Debussy, Berio and Ravel - one of two concerts they will play at London&apos;s Barbican this weekend - but, a lifelong perfectionist, he is not completely happy, and is talking things over with a committee from the orchestra. When I&apos;m finally allowed through to the conductor&apos;s dressing room to meet him - a place where everyone from Gustav Mahler to Leonard Bernstein has taken up residence - he explains. &quot;This is the third time we do this programme. I must say that these Sunday midday concerts are not easy to do. Psychologically, physically the energy is difficult. &quot;I prefer evening concerts. But you know maybe, because it was the third time, there was room for some improvisation and in Debussy&apos;s La Mer, we got a very transparent, very nice sound, and in Ravel&apos;s La Valse as well. But I think the second evening was perhaps the best.&quot; I trust his assessment of his afternoon&apos;s work, but it is hard to imagine how the concert I&apos;ve just heard could have been improved upon. It&apos;s my first time in the Concertgebouw. By reputation, this is one of the world&apos;s greatest acoustics for orchestral music. All I can say is that I&apos;ve never heard an orchestra sound as thrillingly clear or as overwhelmingly sensual as it does here: the delicate splashes of the percussion writing in La Mer were shimmeringly evocative, the huge climaxes of La Valse massively powerful. But acoustics are meaningless without the virtuosity of the performers, and Jansons moulded the opulent warmth of the Concertgebouw&apos;s string section and its dazzling woodwind players into a compelling whole. La Mer was not just an impressionistic illustration of the sea, but a physical experience in its own right, an ocean of sound that contained everything from limpid tranquillity to vicious storms; La Valse a devastating dramatisation of the moment when the pleasure of sensual abandon, the voluptuous rhythm of the waltz, curdles into decadent over-indulgence. For all his brilliance at the helm, Jansons can&apos;t take the credit for turning the Concertgebouw into a world-class band: since its formation in 1888, the orchestra has been recognised as one of the world&apos;s best. Jansons is, however, only the sixth man in charge of the ensemble, taking over from Italian Riccardo Chailly in 2004. I ask him about his vision for the future. &quot;I just want to continue the growth of this wonderful orchestra, and to play a repertoire that goes from Haydn up to contemporary composers. But, you know, even if it&apos;s a top-class orchestra, nothing comes by itself. You must always work to get the best results. Talent is one thing, but work is work - always work.&quot; Jansons, who has just turned 64, should know. He is a product of one the most intense musical educations anywhere in the world. Born in Latvia, where his father was conductor of the opera house in Riga, the family moved to Leningrad when he was in his early teens and Jansons enrolled on the legendary conducting course at the Leningrad Conservatoire. &quot;It was the best training in the world for conductors. We had fantastic opportunities because there was a professional orchestra in the conservatory that we could conduct, and an opera house, too. Such a unique thing doesn&apos;t happen any more.&quot; But conducting was in Jansons&apos; musical make-up right from the start. His father was a role model, and conducting was a dream that the young boy played out in childhood games and fantasies. &quot;It started when I was four or five,&quot; he says. &quot;I made an orchestra of buttons, of paperclips, and rubber erasers - thousands of things - and I would conduct concerts.&quot; Jansons would lay out this miniature orchestra in minute detail, with different formations for different repertoire, and conduct whole pieces from full scores. &quot;If my mother changed one piece for another, I could recognise immediately what had been altered, that there was a button - a player - in the wrong place! I would design whole programmes, and conduct them in rehearsals, after which I would clear them away, and then they would come back for the concert.&quot; Jansons would even dress up in different concert outfits, depending on whether it was a matinee or evening gig. &quot;I played this game for a very long time. Until I was 14 or 15.&quot; It&apos;s a passion that led him - after the transition from buttons to flesh-and-blood players - to long associations with the St Petersburg Philharmonic, where he was involved for 30 years, a two-decade stint transforming the Oslo Philharmonic from also-rans to world-beaters, and later pulling off a similar trick with the Pittsburgh Symphony in the US. Today, the Concertgebouw isn&apos;t Jansons&apos; only job: he&apos;s also music director of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra in Munich. While the Bavarians are not in the same league as the Concertgebouw in terms of fame or prestige, they are a force to be reckoned with, as Jansons showed at the Proms a couple of years ago. During a performance of Strauss&apos;s Ein Heldenleben, the lights in the Albert Hall went out, but Jansons and the orchestra simply kept playing from memory until they were turned on again. How on earth does he manage these two demanding positions in Holland and Germany? &quot;I must treat them both equally. I always say that I&apos;ve divided myself into two Jansons: 100% Jansons in Amsterdam and 100% Jansons in Munich. I have to be very objective, and not prioritise one over the other.&quot; He would say that, of course, but this musical multi-tasking can lead to problems: &quot;I have to be careful about tours, not to play the same piece in the same city with the different orchestras.&quot; It&apos;s a headache, too, for orchestra managers and tour promoters, all of whom want as much as they can get from him. And the endless round of international travel leaves its mark on Jansons&apos; personal life. His constant companion is his wife Irina, who has devoted her life to accompanying him at every rehearsal and concert. They don&apos;t have a base in Amsterdam, living instead in hotels for the 12 weeks of the year they are in Holland, and their home is still St Petersburg. &quot;I don&apos;t perform at all there any more,&quot; says the conductor. &quot;So between tours, I go to St Petersburg and feel at home. I read, I prepare scores, but I&apos;m not doing anything else there. You need somewhere to have some kind of rest in your life.&quot; He doesn&apos;t take holidays, either. Last year, he squeezed in some time in Mauritius after a gruelling tour of Japan and Taiwan with the Concertgebouw. But this week in the sun turned into a chance to catch up on work: &quot;I was working on Beethoven&apos;s Ninth, so every day I was with the score on the beach.&quot; Jansons lives his life with the same intensity that defines any of his performances. But he is lucky to be able to live it in the way he does. Eleven years ago, conducting Puccini&apos;s La Boh\u00e8me in Oslo, Jansons had a heart attack on the podium, just before the end of the piece. He says he knew what was happening to him - his father collapsed and died while conducting a concert with the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra - but still felt he could get to the end of the opera. As he collapsed, he was still beating time. Now fitted with a defibrillator to prevent heart attacks in the future, he says it&apos;s an experience that changed his approach to music and to life. &quot;You know, when you face such a dramatic moment in your life, it influences you - not consciously, but sub-consciously. &quot;I think you become a more profound person. I felt that I started to like more quiet music, definitely; I started to enjoy performing more profound music, more slow tempos. But you have to forget about it as well - you can&apos;t always think about that experience, even if, from a medical point of view, you must never forget.&quot; He admits to not always being as careful with his health now as he was in the immediate aftermath of his operation: Irina offers me a sumptuous selection from Jansons&apos; favourite chocolates - ironically called Puccini - before I leave. Jansons&apos; life now looks like the charmed life of the maestro, able to pick and choose his programmes, his soloists, and his orchestras: every concert he gives with the London Symphony Orchestra is a highlight, and it&apos;s the same with the Vienna Philharmonic. But he still has unrequited musical passions. &quot;I want to do opera, more opera. My problem is that I don&apos;t have the time. But I grew up in the opera house, and my biggest passion is opera. &quot;I&apos;m so happy with the Concertgebouw because I get to do opera every couple of years - it&apos;s Carmen next. But this is my problem: I really want to do more.&quot; I put it to him that there&apos;s a simple solution: give up one of his orchestras. He looks pained, and says, &quot;it&apos;s good to have dreams, and if you don&apos;t fulfil them, it&apos;s OK; hopefully, you can in your next life. In my next life, I&apos;d like to do only opera.&quot; In this life, for the moment at least, the opera world&apos;s loss is the concert hall&apos;s gain. \u00b7 Poulenc&apos;s Gloria and Honegger&apos;s Symphonie Liturgique, conducted by Mariss Jansons, is out now on RCO Live; a 14-CD box set, Anthology of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, is released next month.

Momofuku Ando, who has died aged 96, ate chicken ramen every day. Like them or not, the single-portion version, called Pot Noodles in Britain, and Cup Noodles in the US and elsewhere, has supplied quick and easy feeding for more people than might admit to it. Ando was born in Taiwan when it was still part of the Japanese empire. He was an ethnic Chinese, and did not obtain Japanese citizenship until after the second world war. His parents died when he was still an infant, and he was brought up by grandparents who ran a fabric shop. While his first steps in wealth creation were a textile trading company in Taipei, he moved to Japan in 1933 to study economics at university in Kyoto and to pursue business interests in nearby Osaka. His early commercial ventures might be described as both various and chancy: selling textiles, prefabricated housing, magic lantern projectors and even running a school are all listed by him in his 2002 autobiography How I Invented Magic Noodles. Avoiding any military service, he served a prison sentence for tax evasion in 1948, and came close to bankruptcy through involvement in a failed credit union. Nothing if not determined, he emerged to found the predecessor of his giant corporation Nissin Food Products in the same year, producing salt. His invention of &quot;magic noodles&quot; must be seen in the context of postwar Japan. With the economy in ruins, and a massive reconstruction programme under way, Japan suffered severe imbalances in food supply. The usual staple, rice, was scarce, but there was plenty of wheat, courtesy of the victorious US. Wheat could be consumed as bread (not then Japan&apos;s favourite food), or noodles. Hence, perhaps, the immense queues outside noodle shops which Ando observed in the early 1950s and which was the spur to his developing a noodle that was quick to prepare. There are three sorts of noodle in Japan: soba noodles, made from buckwheat flour; udon noodles - large, thick fresh wheat noodles; and ramen, which are Chinese-style thin noodles. In 1958, Ando launched a precooked, preflavoured dehydrated ramen noodle on to the market as Chikin (chicken) Ramen, sold in a cellophane pack. After cooking, the noodles had been &quot;watered&quot; with chicken soup, seasoned with plenty of monosodium glutamate, then fried in palm oil to dehydrate them. Three minutes in boiling water and they were ready to eat at home. Though they were much pricier than the fresh noodles then available, good first-year sales in the Osaka region warranted further investment. Soon the noodle-shop queues were a dim memory. To a market that adored innovation and commercial chutzpah, and was for the first time embracing the consumer-driven elysium fostered by television and advertising, the instant noodle seemed food of the gods. Ando&apos;s Nissin Food Products soon had plenty of competitors, so that a typical Japanese supermarket had aisles saturated with choice. Myojo Foods, for example, developed an instant noodle with the flavouring packed separately; other companies have pioneered regional recipes; and Nissin itself has vastly extended its product range. It is estimated that the average Japanese person eats 45 portions of instant ramen a year. Ando&apos;s most brilliant move was to package it in individual portions. After setting up the US operation in 1970, he saw his new customers often tipping a serving into a cup and pouring boiling water on to it for a ready-made snack. Taking advantage of new technology in the production of thin, heat-proof styrofoam, he converted this principle into a manufactured packaged item - in the US a cup, in Japan a bowl. The Nissin trademark is Cup Noodles; in Britain, the same process was developed by Golden Wonder and marketed as Pot Noodles from 1979. In its founder&apos;s lifetime, Nissin went from strength to strength, opening 29 subsidiaries in 11 countries. He devoted considerable effort to national affairs, founding the Instant Food Industry Association in 1964, and was behind the International Ramen Manufacturers&apos; Association. There is an Instant Ramen museum in Ikeda, near Osaka, named after him. Ando stepped down from the company chairmanship in 2005, leaving his son Koki as president. Ando is survived by his wife, Masako, two sons and a daughter. \u00b7 Momofuku Ando, businessman, born March 5 1910; died January 5 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/feb/11/comment.politics1", "publicationDate": "2007-02-11T00:07:43Z", "tags": ["Politics", "Labour", "Iraq", "UK news", "World news"], "sentences": ["&apos;It matters that teenagers in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, Mexico, China, Taiwan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Nigeria and Argentina have come to despise America and the American people despite - or precisely because of - their being eager consumers of American culture.&apos; The greatest antipathy is directed at the American President."], "title": "Andrew Rawnsley: Britain needs a declaration of independence from America", "article": "&apos;This sucks,&apos; says the American pilot of an A10 Thunderbolt tank buster when he realises that he has just unleashed a devastating cannon burst on a British armoured patrol. &apos;We&apos;re in jail dude,&apos; chokes his wingman as they return to base, streaming expletives about their deadly mistake. Jail is not where these dudes landed after they fatally strafed their British allies in Iraq in a tragic case of blue-on-blue just after the invasion. The senior officer was subsequently promoted to colonel, awarded the bronze star and now trains other American pilots in ground-attack. The recording is chilling. Gung-ho American reservists on their first combat mission are misled into thinking that there are no &apos;friendlies&apos; in the area. Eager for action, they talk themselves into thinking that the orange panels marking the tanks as their British allies are enemy rocket launchers. They retch and curse when they are told that they have made a horrific blunder. The incident itself was terrible enough, but this is not what has done most damage to Anglo-American relations. The Pentagon obstructed the inquest into the death of Lance Corporal Matty Hull. His widow has had to wait four years until someone leaked the cockpit recording to find out how her husband was killed. The Ministry of Defence appeared unwilling to stand up to its American counterparts and dissembled about whether video footage of the attack existed. Not for the first time, Britain is made to look like a subservient satellite taken wretchedly for granted by the country that is supposed to be its closest ally. Opponents of the war in Iraq get daily vindication that the invasion was a terrible mistake. Supporters of the removal of Saddam feel betrayed by the appalling mess the divided and incompetent Bush administration has made of the aftermath. Tony Blair is an increasingly lonely voice when he pleads that Britain and America must remain each other&apos;s indispensable allies. &apos;We shouldn&apos;t give that up in any set of circumstances,&apos; the Prime Minister declared when he appeared before senior MPs last week. &apos;The relationship with America is what opens lots of doors everywhere.&apos; He did not make his case more persuasive when he selected climate change as an example of what he had got out of his closeness to George W Bush. When he leaves Number 10, his successors will have to fashion a new foreign policy for Britain which recasts its relationship with America and reorients its approach to the rest of the world. The United Kingdom and the United States will remain firm friends. Their histories, economies and cultures are too entwined for it to be otherwise. They will continue to co-operate in the struggle against Islamist terrorism. Often, they will have mutual interests which will put them on the same side in global arguments. That said, the relationship will never be the same again. And Tony Blair is one of the reasons why it will change. He has not been the Prime Minister he expected to be. He entered Downing Street as an instinctively pro-European leader who thought it was his destiny to settle Britain&apos;s relationship with Europe. He ends his premiership with it most defined by his relationship with the United States. The guiding principle of Mr Blair&apos;s foreign policy has been to get as close as he could to the American President, whoever he was. He was Bill Clinton&apos;s closest chum, then George W Bush&apos;s best buddy. As Mr Blair acknowledges, he has paid a high &apos;political penalty&apos; for that. What he or Britain got in return is not clear, even to some of his closest colleagues. &apos;Iraq has been a total disaster,&apos; says one minister who can be normally counted as a great Blair loyalist. One of the unintended consequences of his adherence to America is to make it more likely that his successors will put some distance between themselves and Washington. Gordon Brown talks coolly, if imprecisely, about adopting a stance which puts &apos;Britain&apos;s interests first&apos;. David Cameron has described himself as &apos;a liberal conservative rather than a neoconservative&apos; who would be &apos;solid but not slavish in our friendship with America&apos;. A Conservative government would not join those who believe in &apos;recklessly poking the United States in the eye&apos;, but nor would it be &apos;America&apos;s unconditional associate in every endeavour&apos;. Mr Cameron is not anti-American. Neither is Gordon Brown. But they do sense the demand in Britain for our own declaration of independence from America. Globescan regularly conducts a massive poll of attitudes towards the United States by sampling the opinion of 26,000 people across 25 countries. The latest survey finds antagonism towards America at an intense pitch. Even in countries such as Poland which are traditionally warm towards the US, public opinion has turned very sour. Britain is becoming almost as anti-American as France has historically been. Just a third of Britons now regard the United States as a force for good. Even if a future Prime Minister could convince himself that it would be sensible to do another Iraq, he would have huge difficulty persuading his colleagues or the public that he had not gone mad. Tony Blair has been fixated with Washington because his guiding belief is that Britain maximises its global influence by flying as wingman to America. That role will seem less attractive to his successors for several reasons. One is that American power is going into decline. Sure, for the foreseeable future, the United States will remain a colossal military force, but its relative global clout will diminish as this century gets older. Iraq has already made the United States look much weaker in the eyes of the world. It has been a sanguinary lesson in the limitations of &apos;hard&apos; power. Even some of the architects of the &apos;surge&apos; plan don&apos;t believe that George W Bush&apos;s last throw is going to pacify Baghdad. Even under Tony Blair, American and British priorities are diverging. As the United States pours more troops into Iraq, Britain is desperate to get its soldiers home. Immense damage has also been done to America&apos;s &apos;soft&apos; power - the capacity to influence the world by example and persuasion. Uncouth Nation is a new book which explores rising anti-Americanism. Its author, Andrei Markovits, a professor at the University of Michigan, deplores the phenomenon, but that doesn&apos;t inhibit him from detailing its increase and its consquences. &apos;It matters that teenagers in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, South Korea, Mexico, China, Taiwan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Nigeria and Argentina have come to despise America and the American people despite - or precisely because of - their being eager consumers of American culture.&apos; The greatest antipathy is directed at the American President. As Markovits has it: &apos;Bush represents to Europeans the quintessential ugly American: arrogant, uncouth, uncultured, ignorant, inconsiderate, and aggressive.&apos; The departure of George W Bush may soften some of the hostility towards America. What it won&apos;t do is change the deeper, underlying trends which will demand a British foreign policy that is less exclusively concentrated on the relationship with the White House. Masked by the narrow and furious focus on the Middle East of the last few years, the tectonic plates of geopolitics are shifting. For a brief period after the fall of the Berlin Wall, American was an unchallenged hegemon, the only superpower - &apos;the hyperpuissance,&apos; in the phrase of a French Foreign Minister. The world is becoming increasingly multipolar and more reminiscent of the competing Great Powers of the 19th century. Russia has just announced that it is going to exploit its economic revival to rebuild its military strength. China is constructing a blue-water navy, demonstrating the capacity to shoot satellites out of space and buying up vast tracts of Africa in order to use the continent&apos;s oil and minerals to feed Chinese economic growth. Brazil and India are also achieving the growth to enable them to become the world powers that their geographical and population size say they should be. In this new world order, America will be less focused on its old friends across the Atlantic and more geared towards making alliances and confronting threats in the Pacific and Asia. The world&apos;s most powerful economic group has been the G7: America, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Sometime around the middle of this century, it is very probable that the G7 will be surpassed by the combined economic power of the BRICs - Brazil, Russia, India and China. That will be a decisive shift of global clout from the old West to the new powers of the South and the East. Gordon Brown talks readily about the challenge of India and China, but he has yet to provide details of how he would recast British foreign policy to deal with it. All the effort he has put into debt relief and good governance in Africa is undermined when China is supplying huge loans with no human rights strings attached. Both he and David Cameron will have to think about how to re-energise Europe as a world player and reinvigorate Britain&apos;s relationship with her closest neighbours. On the Chancellor&apos;s recent trip to India, there was a telling moment when the Indian Prime Minister greeted him as a &apos;leader of the EU&apos;. That is not how Mr Brown, who has a reputation as a grudging European, is accustomed to thinking of himself. The Tory leader&apos;s attempts to build relationships in the EU is handicapped by his party&apos;s atavistic hostility to everything European. Global institutions which reflect the balance of world power as it was in 1945 will have to be radically overhauled. It will become ever harder to justify Britain&apos;s possession of a permanent seat on the UN Security Council when Brazil and India do not have one. The big issues of this century - none of them more important than climate change - cannot be addressed by a foreign policy obsessed only with hugging Washington. The challenge for Tony Blair&apos;s successors will be to embrace the whole of a rapidly changing world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/feb/12/uknews.pollution", "publicationDate": "2007-02-12T09:51:03Z", "tags": ["Environment", "UK news", "Pollution"], "sentences": ["In Japan and Taiwan, the children of women who had eaten rice oil contaminated with PCBs were underweight and lagged behind their peers in development."], "title": "Explainer: What are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)?", "article": "Polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, are stable man-made organic compounds. That was their value to industry and in the past few decades that has been the problem. They were used from the 1920s as cooling and insulating fluids for transformers and capacitors because they did not burn easily, but eventually it was discovered that they also did not easily biodegrade. Although most were banned in 1986, they linger on in detectable levels in animals, fish and humans. When they are incinerated, they can produce dioxins, which are some of the most toxic substances known to science. The biggest manufacturer of PCBs was Monsanto, which marketed them as Aroclor from 1930 to 1977. General Electric had a rival product called Pyranol. They were used in an enormous number of products, from lubricants to pesticides, paper, adhesives, plastics, paint and flame retardants. But the concerns began when high levels of PCBs were found in fish, particularly in the great lakes of north America. Work in the 1970s and 1980s established that the man-made chemicals dumped as waste in Lake Michigan were accumulating not just in the fatty sport fish caught there but in the breast milk of nursing mothers who had eaten them. Their children showed higher rates of development and learning disorders than those of local women who had not eaten the fish. In Japan and Taiwan, the children of women who had eaten rice oil contaminated with PCBs were underweight and lagged behind their peers in development. Adults working with PCBs were prone to developing a skin condition called chloracne, which produces pustules and cysts. In 1986, an international agreement was signed to ban most uses of PCBs and phase out the rest. But while they are no longer manufactured, they still leak from old electrical devices, including television sets and fluorescent lights, and can be released from hazardous waste sites and illegal dumps. They also persist in fatty foods, such as certain sorts of fish, meat and dairy products."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/13/international.mainsection4", "publicationDate": "2007-02-13T00:27:37Z", "tags": ["World news"], "sentences": ["Angelique Chrisafis in Paris Post service name change threatens to upset China President Chen Shui-bian renamed Taiwan&apos;s postal service &quot;Taiwan Post&quot; yesterday, saying the change from Chinese Post was a step towards making the island a &quot;normal country&quot; separate from China.", "Many state-run companies kept &quot;China&quot; or &quot;Chinese&quot; in their names, after Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Nationalist government settled in Taiwan after defeat by Communist forces in 1949."], "title": "World news in brief", "article": "President declares emergency after riots Guinea&apos;s president, Lansana Cont\u00e9, declared a state of emergency yesterday, announcing that he had ordered the army to &quot;take all necessary measures&quot; to restore order after violent protests.

What if a friendly state becomes hostile? What if enemy forces surge beyond expectations? What if defenses do not work as planned? The higher the potential costs of the answer, the greater the question&apos;s significance. And, when it comes to nuclear matters, what-ifs, however iffy, assume fantastic importance. As debate heats up over Tony Blair&apos;s decision to refurbish Britain&apos;s aging nuclear deterrent, what-ifs are now swarming around Britain&apos;s defense establishment like malarial mosquitoes - dangerous and persistent. &quot;What if&quot; is the essential argument - if it can be called that - for the government&apos;s decision to continue deploying 16 megatons of destructive power in the post-Cold War world, even though Britain&apos;s deterrent does not actually deter. After all, nuclear weapons will not dissuade a terrorist attack, and a nuclear conflict between states is most likely to occur between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, or possibly between China and the United States over Taiwan. True, the US may militarily confront Iran - as might Israel. Nuclear deterrents clearly remain relevant even in a world focused on terrorism, but it&apos;s hard to imagine a scenario in which Britain figures. And, yet, what if? What if Iran or North Korea held London hostage to prevent an attack by US or Nato forces aimed at destroying its nuclear infrastructure? It&apos;s a prudent question. Which is why the dominant metaphor of the Trident debate has been that of insurance, the incarnation of humanity&apos;s aversion to risk. As the Economist approvingly opened an editorial on the subject, &quot;Like a wise householder protecting his home against remote but catastrophic risks, Tony Blair says his decision on December 4th to build a new generation of submarine-based nuclear weapons was just &apos;insurance&apos; in a turbulent world.&quot; But there may be a more apt, if less flattering, analogy. Nuclear weapons have a way of producing obsessive-compulsive thinking in military strategists. War planners may begin with a rational premise, proceed via logical steps, and yet arrive at an absurd worst-case conclusion. The phenomenon is reminiscent of an obsessive-compulsive who gets out of bed several times a night to check if he has turned off the oven, even if he&apos;s almost certain he did so hours earlier. The potentially catastrophic consequence of being wrong - a fatal gas explosion - make disrupting his sleep a wise investment. The benefits outweigh the costs. Repeated over time, however, such behavior results in neurotic paralysis. Actions that are rational on a small scale become profoundly irrational on a large scale. American nuclear policy during the Cold War often exhibited such characteristics. Although America had thousands of warheads capable of raining millions of Hiroshimas worth of destruction on the Soviet Union, Washington often feared it was underarmed. Why? In the 1970s, some American strategists posited a &quot;third strike&quot; dilemma. In this scenario, the Soviet Union might knock out U.S. land-based Minutemen silos - a so-called &quot;counterforce&quot; strike that purposely avoided our cities - while retaining some nuclear weapons in reserve. The fear was that, even though the United States could retaliate using missiles from its nuclear submarines (which are essentially invulnerable because they&apos;re hard to detect), it would choose not to. After all, the Soviets could then strike yet again, destroying our cities. American fear of this vulnerability prompted a late surge in the Cold War arms race. This thinking seemed rational, but its veneer of logic concealed serious flaws. For one thing, the enormous destructive power of even a single nuclear weapon makes leaders risk averse. Even when the US had a theoretical first-strike capability, as during the Cuban missile crisis, it was restrained by the possibility that a handful of Soviet missiles might survive to retaliate against American cities. Furthermore, the US would have been hard-pressed to identify a Soviet attack as &quot;only&quot; counterforce: thousands of incoming warheads would have looked like an all-out attack and prompted a rapid response. Finally, even if it had been possible to discern the &quot;limited&quot; nature of such a pulse-pounding onslaught, it is impossible to believe that an American president would not have responded after the 2,000 megatons of explosives needed to obliterate the Minutemen had detonated on American soil. Britain must ask itself whether the seduction of the what-if has not lured it to an illogical conclusion. The odds of Iran or North Korea attacking Britain with a nuclear missile are vanishingly small. For one thing, neither state yet has such a capability. For another, an attack on Britain would be considered an attack on Nato, which includes the US with its still-formidable atomic arsenal. Finally, it&apos;s worth noting that if Britain &quot;disarmed,&quot; it would retain the knowledge - and perhaps the fissile material - to reconstitute its weapons. No state could attack Britain without expecting an eventual nuclear response. To the extent that any country needs these weapons, Britain and France arguably need them the least. Non-nuclear states facing nuclear foes, such as South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, have a much stronger case. Yet the UK cannot shake its compulsion to keep them. We must ask, if a state under no direct threat from another nuclear state cannot afford to disarm, then who could, and when? Blair has suggested that Britain might need nuclear weapons in the eventuality that a rogue state helped a terrorist group build a nuclear weapon. But, if the specter of Iran and North Korea giving bombs to terrorists is reason enough for a deterrent, then every potential terrorist target ought to have nuclear weapons. In other words, everyone should. Faced with the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, hawks and doves from George Bush to Kofi Annan have concluded that the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty needs rejuvenation. Eliminating Trident would not transform Mahmoud Ahmadinejad into a mensch. But disarmament - a striking action, brave for its clean break with past nuclear thinking - might catapult Britain to a position of moral leadership on nuclear issues, a position the Bush administration abdicated long ago. Used effectively, such leadership could breathe new life into the NPT, allowing us to finally stop thinking about what if, and start thinking about what next."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/19/marketforces", "publicationDate": "2007-02-19T17:14:28Z", "tags": ["Business"], "sentences": ["It is seeking a bolt-on deal outside Israel, with Taiwan, South Africa and Ireland possible targets."], "title": "Commodities back in favour", "article": " A rise in miners and the usual spate of Monday takeover speculation pushed leading shares higher today.

Can this possibly be acceptable? The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust thinks not and after several years of trying to persuade the company to abandon its promotion of arms has now sold its shares. The Lancet too has asked (registration required) its owner to abandon the arms business but has been ignored. There are nearly 650m guns and light weapons in the world, and each year some 8m are added. Every year about half a million people are killed by armed violence. Most of those who die are civilians, particularly women and children. Since the second world war 85% of armed conflicts have been in the poor world, and by 2020, as the Lancet told us (registration required), deaths and injuries from war and violence will overtake deaths from infectious disease. Those of us who live in south London can testify to the consequences of guns being too easily available. War and armed conflicts are the main barriers to development in poor countries, and expenditure on arms diverts resources from education and health. Yet last year&apos;s UN conference on small arms collapsed without agreement, again as the Lancet told us. Reed Elsevier runs arms fairs through its subsidiary Reed Exhibitions in Britain, the United States, the Middle East, Brazil, Germany, and Taiwan. Fairs have in the past included cluster bombs, which are especially dangerous to civilians because they fail to explode and create minefields. That is why the Lancet has consistently spoken out against cluster bombs. Last year&apos;s fair in the US included torture equipment sold by Security Equipment Corporation who use the grotesque slogan &quot;Making grown men cry since 1975.&quot; The Lancet has long been a leader in condemning torture. The company says that it is legal to sell arms, the trade is tightly regulated, and arms are clearly needed in a dangerous world. Unfortunately, the scale of sales is clearly excessive - and the harm that results is experienced mostly by women and children in the world&apos;s poorest countries. That&apos;s why medical journals have long drawn attention to the dangers of arms sales. The hypocrisy of selling arms and health is particularly galling for the Lancet and its readers - because the Lancet has established itself as the world&apos;s leading global health journal. It is concerned not simply with scientific research that advances western medicine but also with poverty, injustice, environmental destruction, and war - the factors that mean life expectancy in the poorest countries is little over 30. The journal has had a radical tradition ever since it was founded by Thomas Wakley in 1823, and Richard Horton, the current editor, has restored that tradition and made it global. The Lancet has, for example, published (registration required) two important papers showing that deaths in Iraq are far higher than admitted by the Iraq, US, and UK governments. Horton can be seen on YouTube speaking about the excess deaths at an anti-war demonstration in Manchester. The Lancet has taken the bold step of speaking out against its owner&apos;s excesses, but little has been heard from the editors, authors, and readers of the other 2000 journals published by Reed Elsevier. We need worldwide clamour to stop Reed Elsevier promoting the sales of arms and to save the credibility of its journals, especially the Lancet. So far, however, words have achieved little. It may be that the company needs to be hit where it hurts most - in its profits. The company makes most of its profits from its scientific and technical division, and, as I&apos;ve argued (pdf) in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, if authors were to stop sending their research to the company&apos;s journals it would rapidly ditch its arms fairs."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/27/china.money", "publicationDate": "2007-02-27T11:39:51Z", "tags": ["Business", "China", "Money", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Under terms of the deal, Wal-Mart is buying 35% of Taiwan-based Bounteous, which operates 101 hypermarkets in 34 Chinese cities under the Trust-Mart brand.", "Trust-Mart was founded in the mid-1990s by Taiwan tycoon Winston Wong, a scion of the petrochemical conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group."], "title": "Wal-Mart invests in China", "article": "The world&apos;s biggest retailer Wal-Mart today announced a takeover of a Chinese discount chain for an estimated $1bn (\u00a3500m) in China&apos;s booming retail market.

He later told reporters in Tokyo: &quot;If Taiwan is placed under its complete influence, Japan could be next. That&apos;s how much China is seeking hegemony.&quot; Mr Nakagawa&apos;s comment received a frosty response in Beijing, where the government has long played down fears that China&apos;s rapid rise poses a threat to other nations. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said: &quot;China has long borders on land and sea, so it is very natural to maintain a certain amount of defence power, completely for the purpose of maintaining the country&apos;s sovereignty and territorial integrity. It gives no cause for criticism.&quot; The US and Japan have raised questions about the military build-up of the world&apos;s most populous nation. In recent years China&apos;s declared defence budget has increased at double digit pace, exceeding even the spectacular growth of the economy. Last year, Beijing&apos;s reported 2006 budget was $35bn, compared to $42bn for Japan. According to western analysts, however, the real figure is considerably higher because the People&apos;s Liberation Army, which numbers 2.3 million personnel, conceals much of its spending. Mr Nakagawa&apos;s comments are likely to worsen the relationship between Asia&apos;s two biggest powers, which had recently shown signs of a slight thaw after years of tension. Mr Qin raised suspicions about the timing and nature of the outburst. &quot;China&apos;s military expenditure per capita is 7% of that of Japan,&quot; he said. &quot;Meanwhile, it claims that China is a threat. We should question: What is the real purpose and motivation behind these claims?&quot; It is the second time in less than a week that the Chinese foreign ministry has had to rebut accusations about Beijing&apos;s intentions. Last week, the US vice president, Dick Cheney, said China&apos;s increase in military spending and its recent test firing of an anti-satellite missile were inconsistent with its claim of being a peacefully rising power. Mr Qin repeated China&apos;s stance that it advocates the peaceful use of space and opposes arms races there. But Mr Nakagawa said the launch of the anti-satellite missile was a deliberate challenge to Japan, which successfully launched a spy satellite at the weekend. &quot;China showed that it could destroy a satellite if it launches from the ground, just like that,&quot; he said. &quot;It wouldn&apos;t be strange to think that it was an experiment conducted with Japan&apos;s satellite launch in sight.&quot; His comments come at a crucial time for Sino-Japanese relations. After years of tension under Japan&apos;s previous leader, Junichiro Koizumi, relations between the two appeared to have thawed when his successor, Shinzo Abe, visited Beijing last October. The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, is due to visit Japan in April in what would be the first visit by a Chinese leader since 2000. Mr Nakagawa is not the first Japanese official to voice concern over China&apos;s military build-up, but his dramatic scenario was met with consternation in Tokyo. &quot;We are rather more confident than he is about China,&quot; a government official told the Guardian on condition of anonymity. &quot;Japan will never be part of China. While China is not a strategic partner, it is true that we share increasingly common strategic interests such as economic development, environmental concerns and maintaining peace and stability in the region.&quot; Mr Abe, who appointed Mr Nakagawa when he took office last autumn, said it was &quot;meaningless to dwell on just a few words taken out from a full speech&quot;. In the past it was often said that Japan might become the 51st state of the United States, he told reporters. But, he added, China had yet to explain the intention behind its missile test. &quot;We have been asking China to provide an explanation that is acceptable to the international community.&quot; Mr Nakagawa, a famously loquacious, staunchly nationalist MP, shares Mr Abe&apos;s tough line against North Korea. He was one of several Liberal Democratic politicians who called on Japan to debate the merits of developing a nuclear arsenal after Pyongyang conducted a nuclear test last October."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/27/5", "publicationDate": "2007-02-27T15:55:39Z", "tags": ["Business"], "sentences": ["Globally, and on the ground in many of our markets, the picture looks good.&quot; Last year the bank bought Union Bank in Pakistan and Hsinchu International Bank in Taiwan, and group chief executive, Peter Sands, said that the strategic focus of 2007 would be on in these countries."], "title": "Global bank's profits hit $3bn", "article": "Global bank Standard Chartered today reported a 19% increase in pre-tax profits, which it attributed to &quot;strong organic growth and continued good progress in Korea&quot;.

Their biography also showed how much Mao owed Chiang for giving him a free pass for much of the legendary Long March. Chiang and Mao had other areas of agreement as well, notably their common determination that Taiwan was part of one China, with one legitimate government, even though they begged to differ about which of their governments that was. So it will be interesting to see Beijing&apos;s reaction to the news that the Taiwanese government is downgrading the massive Mausoleum to Chiang Kai Shek in Taipei, and evicting the old Generalissimo&apos;s mortal remains from it. Taiwan&apos;s pro-independence government have already de-Chianged Taiwan&apos;s airport, the presidential palace and moved his omnipresent statue from military barracks. They have also begun to rename the old agencies, deleting the vestigial &quot;China&quot; in the title. The next move is to commemorate the massacre, which took place sixty years ago this week (February 28 1947) of some 28,000 Taiwanese that Chiang staged as a &quot;welcome-back to the motherland&quot; for the brief period in modern history when Taiwan and the mainland shared the same government. Back in Beijing, crowds still queue to see the pickled chairman in the mausoleum while his head still adorns the appreciating Yuan. And his successors still maintain the peculiar protocols of the People&apos;s Democracy, one of which is pointing more than 900 missiles at Taiwan and threatening to unleash them if the Taiwanese people should ever renounce their vestigial claim to the mainland and declare the island an independent entity. In fact, the mainland would be better off inviting Taiwan to take over. Since Chiang&apos;s death, the island has built a prosperous and vibrant, albeit boisterous, democracy, which in the social democratic sense - of unions, labour regulation and a national health service - is actually more socialist than the mainland. Taiwan&apos;s elected rulers are actively engaged in exorcising the tyrannical past, in contrast to the comrades in Beijing, who try to avoid mentioning Mao the way that John Cleese tried to avoid mentioning the war. The chairman keeps cropping up anyway. In contrast, the People&apos;s Republic still adheres to the old principle that the way to win hearts and minds is either to twist testicles or put bullets in brains. Those 900 missiles are hardly a Valentine&apos;s Day card to the broad masses of compatriots in Taiwan. In the modern world, as the British discovered in Ireland, and indeed earlier with the 13 ex-colonies, it is difficult to win love and respect at the point of a bayonet. China&apos;s threats are more than a little counterproductive in building a spirit of Chinese patriotism among Taiwanese. China spent decades supporting the right to self-determination for its chums in the non-aligned. It could try being consistent. Indeed one additional charge that pro-independence Taiwanese may bring against Chiang is that when the mainland won the China seat at the UN in 1974, he withdrew his delegation. In the nature of the UN, Taiwan, as the Republic of China, could have relied on sheer inertia to retain a seat in the general assembly. Now of course, Beijing bullies and the rest of the world kow-tows. There is only one China, agreed Richard Nixon in the Shanghai Communique. And the rest of the world is prepared, for example, to leave a diplomatic and global governance vacuum in the epicentre of the SARS and Avian Flu global potential pandemics because Taiwan can&apos;t join the WHO. China keeps growling in the UN about the peacekeeping force in Haiti because the Haitians still recognise Taiwan. It is past time for other countries to stop the kow-towing and bring the PRC up to speed with historical progress. The Middle Kingdom is, like Monty Python&apos;s parrot, &quot;dead, passed on ... no more ... a stiff ...b ereft of life&quot;, and should be left &quot;to rest in peace&quot;. The PRC&apos;s claim to Taiwan has all the legal and moral stature of a revanchist British claim to Ireland or New Zealand. In fact, less. The British ruled those places far longer than the mainland had any effective power in Taiwan. Even if one were to accept the PRC&apos;s claims, the Chinese delegation, along with the rest of the world, accepted the new doctrine of the Responsibility to Protect at the 2005 UN heads of state summit. Legally, Beijing can no longer croon &quot;&apos;t ain&apos;t nobody&apos;s business if I do&quot;, if they drop 900 missiles on Taiwan. The rest of the world has a responsibility to intervene - and a large self- interest. It also has a big incentive to start thinking about this. Perhaps most disturbingly for the future is the US guarantee to Taiwan against a Chinese invasion, which in turn, the Chinese have promised if the Taiwanese &quot;declare independence&quot;. A promise from Tricky Dicky is not the most negotiable currency in the world, and looking at the amount of money made in the US from buying Chinese goods cheap and selling them dear, it would be natural for Taiwanese to wonder about the protective umbrella. It was in return for those guarantees that they gave up on nuclear weapons. If the guarantees begin to look shaky then maybe the nuclear self-denial will be as well. If Taiwan is not a state it cannot join the non-proliferation treaty. and if it is part of China, then it benefits from the existing nuclear powers&apos; exemption in the treaty. Whether it builds or buys them (North Korea may have some on offer) there are few nuclear powers in the world with half the justification that Taiwan has. There should be some serious negotiations with China about ending this impasse, not from the usual prone posture before the throne. They should be told: you can woo, but you cannot rape. And they have to take no for an answer if that&apos;s what the Taiwanese want. Beijing&apos;s rulers can keep Mao on the banknotes, but should get him out of their heads."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview20", "publicationDate": "2007-03-03T23:56:17Z", "tags": ["Books", "Fiction", "Culture", "Mohsin Hamid"], "sentences": ["Vietnam, Korea, the straits of Taiwan ...&quot; The nature of fiction is to make one distrustful of any character who lectures and castigates."], "title": "Review: The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid", "article": "The Reluctant Fundamentalistby Mohsin Hamid192pp, Hamish Hamilton, \u00a314.99 The janissaries of the Ottoman empire were captured Christian boys trained to fight against their own people, which they did with singular ferocity. This interesting class of warrior is described during a business lunch to Changez, the young hero of Mohsin Hamid&apos;s second novel, at a moment of crisis over his own identity. Born in Pakistan, educated at Princeton and currently the hottest new employee at a New York firm specialising in ruthless appraisals of ailing companies being targeted for takeover, Changez recognises himself in the description. &quot;I was a modern-day janissary,&quot; he observes, &quot;a servant of the American empire at a time when it was invading a country with a kinship to mine ...&quot; The recognition completes a process of inward transformation that began when he realised he was half-gladdened by the World Trade Center attacks, and it now prompts him to sabotage his own high-flying career, to give up his pursuit of the beautiful, troubled Wasp princess Erica and go back to Lahore. There, bearded and generally reacculturated, he meets an American in a restaurant in the Old Anarkali district, and buttonholes him with his life story. The novel is his monologue: a quietly told, cleverly constructed fable of infatuation and disenchantment with America, set on the treacherous faultlines of current east/west relations, and finely tuned to the ironies of mutual - but especially American - prejudice and misrepresentation. The richest instance of the latter is in the way it plays with the idea of fundamentalism itself. From the title, and from the increasingly tense atmosphere arising between Changez and his American listener, the expectation is that Changez is moving towards the revelation that he has gone, however &quot;reluctantly&quot;, all the way over to the dark side of Islamic fundamentalism, and is possibly, even as he speaks, orchestrating some Daniel Pearl-like execution of his perhaps literally captive audience. But in a neat - arguably too neat - reversal, it transpires that the real fundamentalism at issue here is that of US capitalism, specifically that practised by Changez&apos;s former employer, Underwood Samson, whose motto, as they do their pitiless bit for globalisation, is &quot;Focus on the fundamentals&quot;. The subverted expectation very efficiently forces one to reconsider one&apos;s preconceptions about such words and their meanings, and a point is duly scored for relativism. This precise, rather classical orchestration of symmetries and reciprocities is both a strength and a weakness in the book. It fosters the kind of concentratedly astute cultural observation at which Hamid excels. At frequent intervals the narrative executes a nice flourish in the form of some densely emblematic image or epigrammatic remark. Changez pithily summarises, for instance, the experience of every happy Manhattan transplant when he declares: &quot;I was, in four and a half years, never an American; I was immediately a New Yorker.&quot; And his figure for that city in its ominously flag-bedecked state following the 9/11 attacks - &quot;I wondered what manner of host would sally forth from so grand a castle&quot; - is perfect both as a visual image and as a deepening of the book&apos;s running theme of sic transit gloria mundi in which the triumphalist militarism of the US is repeatedly mapped over the ruined glory of the old Mughal empire. But at the same time, this aphoristic tendency gives the story a slightly abstracted, thin-blooded quality. You notice this especially in the relationship between Changez and Erica. This privileged, patrician girl has a tragedy in her past: a childhood sweetheart named Chris, who died in his teens. Her growing intimacy with Changez, while interestingly free of the racial tensions that traditionally afflict such couples in literature, is nevertheless thwarted by her inability to forget Chris or allow Changez to take his place. In the turbulence following September 11, this preoccupation with her own past becomes a crippling obsession - &quot;she was disappearing into a powerful nostalgia&quot; - resulting in a breakdown, hospitalisation and probable suicide. It all feels a little sketchy, psychologically: simultaneously over the top and undersubstantiated. But after a while you realise you&apos;re not in the realm of psychology at all, but of allegory (and if you don&apos;t, a nudge or two from the narrator - &quot;it seemed to me that America, too, was increasingly giving itself over to a dangerous nostalgia&quot; - soon sets you straight). It dawns on you that Erica is America (Am-Erica) and that Chris&apos;s name has been chosen to represent the nation&apos;s fraught relationship with its moment of European discovery and conquest, while the narrator himself stands for the country&apos;s consequent inability to accept, uh, changez. To be fair, the allegory isn&apos;t as glibly intrusive as that makes it sound, but it has a stiffening effect on the narrative, shifting it from the dramatic to the essayistic. It&apos;s no great surprise to hear Changez drop his sinuously self-deprecating manner towards the end, in favour of something more finger-waggingly polemical: &quot;I had always resented the manner in which America conducted itself in the world; your country&apos;s constant interference in the affairs of others was insufferable. Vietnam, Korea, the straits of Taiwan ...&quot; The nature of fiction is to make one distrustful of any character who lectures and castigates. By what higher personal virtue does Changez presume to judge? The question opens the book to the charge of a more serious flaw: one expects Changez&apos;s opposition to America&apos;s conduct to be founded on some morally superior alternative set of values. But aside from his discovery of his own patriotism, his repudiation of America in the wake of the September 11 attacks is a curiously frictionless, voluntary event, leaving one with an odd sense that his decision to quit is ultimately just the superior opportunism of a well-trained appraiser of ailing companies, who knows which way the wind is blowing. A potentially fascinating character, but not, I think, what his creator intended. There&apos;s undoubtedly a great novel waiting to be written out of the anguished material of these kinds of east/west encounters. This book may not be it, but its author (who won a Betty Trask award for his first novel, Moth Smoke) certainly has the potential to write it. My criticisms of The Reluctant Fundamentalist are a testament to its genuinely provocative nature, and it remains, at the very least, an intelligent, highly engaging piece of work. \u00b7 James Lasdun&apos;s most recent novel is Seven Lies (Vintage)."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/05/china.jonathanwatts", "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T08:13:21Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["In the short term, however, it is Taiwan that has the most to fear from a Chinese military build-up.", "The US, which is obliged to defend Taiwan in the event of a conflict, has repeatedly expressed concern about the power and secrecy of the Chinese military."], "title": "Asian arms race fear as Beijing raises spending", "article": "International concerns about China&apos;s growing military power and a spiralling global arms race intensified yesterday when Beijing announced its biggest defence budget increase for more than 10 years. Weeks after China stunned the world by test-firing its first anti-satellite missile, the government said it will increase spending by 17.8% this year. The sharp rise - almost double the pace of economic growth - will be used to modernise the People&apos;s Liberation Army. With 2.3 million troops, the PLA has long been the world&apos;s biggest military force, but it is only in recent years that it has started to acquire sophisticated weaponry. Extra spending on missile systems, electronic warfare and other hi-tech items will push up the declared budget to 350.9bn yuan (\u00a323bn), an increase of 53bn yuan on 2006. Western defence analysts say the true figure could be two to three times that because so much defence spending is concealed. Jiang Enzhu, spokesman for the National People&apos;s Congress, said that even with the increase China&apos;s military budget was less than a tenth of the Pentagon&apos;s. The US defence department has asked for $481bn (\u00a3247bn) this year, not including operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. &quot;In recent years, China has steadily increased defence spending based on its economic development,&quot; Mr Jiang said. &quot;China has neither the wherewithal nor the intention to enter into an arms race with any country, and China won&apos;t constitute a threat to any country.&quot; Such assurances are unlikely to convince its near neighbours Japan and India. Both countries have increased their defence budgets in what is increasingly looking like an Asian arms race. In the short term, however, it is Taiwan that has the most to fear from a Chinese military build-up. The island is viewed in Beijing as a renegade province. Hundreds of missiles are aimed across the strait and communist leaders have repeatedly warned that they are prepared to reunite the two sides by force if necessary. The US, which is obliged to defend Taiwan in the event of a conflict, has repeatedly expressed concern about the power and secrecy of the Chinese military. The US deputy secretary of state, John Negroponte, said China had failed to clarify its intentions. &quot;I think the point we would make with respect to military spending and military acquisition of various types would be the point about transparency,&quot; he told a news conference in Beijing. &quot;It&apos;s not so much the budget and the increases as much as it is understanding those questions better through dialogue and transparency.&quot; Last month the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, said Beijing&apos;s military build-up and recent firing of a missile to destroy an old weather satellite were &quot;not consistent with Beijing&apos;s stated goal of a peaceful rise&quot;. Officials in Beijing have rebuffed such accusations. The commander of the PLA general logistics department, Liao Xilong, told the Xinhua news agency that the budget rise was needed at a time of international uncertainty. &quot;The present-day world is none too peaceful,&quot; he said, &quot;and to protect national security, stability and territorial integrity we must suitably increase spending on military modernisation.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/05/secondworldwar.japan", "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T10:10:19Z", "tags": ["World news", "Second world war", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Lee Yong-soo, a Korean, was 15 when snatched from her home in 1944 and taken to work in a military brothel in Taiwan."], "title": "Japan rules out new apology to 'comfort women'", "article": "Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told parliament early this morning that he would not apologise again for his country&apos;s second world war military brothels, even if the US Congress passes a resolution demanding it. &quot;I must say we will not apologise even if there&apos;s a [US] resolution,&quot; Mr Abe told MPs in a lengthy debate, during which he also said he stood by Japan&apos;s landmark 1993 apology on the brothels.

South Korea accused him of attempting to &quot;gloss over a historic truth&quot;. An apology in 1993 by the chief cabinet secretary at the time, Yohei Kono, acknowledged that many of the women had been forced to have sex.

Pledges back in 2004 that Beijing&apos;s games would be corruption-free have turned out easier to make than keep. Cost overruns have also dogged next year&apos;s event, designed to be a showcase for China&apos;s rising stature economically and politically. The Olympics are expected to feature prominently at this week&apos;s session of the National People&apos;s Congress, China&apos;s parliament, amid concern about the expenses and other issues. Most embarrassing of all has been the issue of corruption, which is hardly surprising as it rears its head on a regular basis in the country.  The government has already had to sack Beijing&apos;s deputy-mayor Liu Zhihua, who was in charge of Olympic projects, and the party secretary of the eastern city of Qingdao, home to the Tsingtao brewery, following allegations of corruption. Things in London are unlikely to reach such a pass. That cost overruns are part and parcel of the Olympics goes almost without saying. But in China, merely reporting the fact can land you in trouble. In 2005, the government punished the Beijing Evening News for reporting that next year&apos;s games would cost an extra $750m to the $2.3bn figure mentioned in China&apos;s bid. Even the torch-carrying ritual has thrown up its own set of issues with environmental groups criticising the decision to take the torch to the top of Mount Everest, while it remains unclear whether Taiwan will allow the torch to be carried to the island. Another headache is pollution. Air quality in this urban sprawl of 10 million people and its freeways - not unlike Los Angeles - is not up to snuff. The Asian Development Bank said in a recent study that Beijing was the most polluted city in Asia, so the city has to literally clean up its act in the coming months.

Spending on schools, medical clinics and other services in the countryside will be boosted by 15%, Mr Wen told the near-3,000 delegates inside the Great Hall of the People for the 17-day gathering of the country&apos;s toothless legislature, which rubber-stamps Communist party policy. China must also take measures to deal with the increasing environmental consequences of its economic transformation, the premier said. &quot;We must make conserving energy, decreasing energy consumption, protecting the environment and using land intensively the breakthrough point and main fulcrum for changing the pattern of economic growth,&quot; he said  Small coal-burning power plants and &quot;backward iron foundries and steel mills&quot;, which contribute excessively to smog, would be shut, he told the delegates. China&apos;s status as the world&apos;s fastest-growing major economy has brought with it a number of serious environmental problems, and the country is now home to five of the world&apos;s 10 most polluted cities. However, previous pledges to make economic growth greener have had little tangible impact. In today&apos;s address, Mr Wen made no mention of efforts to combat global warming, and omitted any specific goal for cutting energy use. Last year, Beijing set a target of reducing energy use per unit of output by 4%, which it failed to achieve. Another major concern, highlighted in the past by both Mr Wen and China&apos;s president, Hu Jintao, is the ever-increasing wealth gap between the country&apos;s thriving cities and its poor rural interior, home to 60% of its 1.3 billion people. This urban-rural divide has prompted many millions of people from the countryside to head to the cities looking for work in recent years. As well as the extra spending, efforts to abolish most school fees for rural children would spread nationwide, Mr Wen said, while a scheme to offer farmers basic healthcare would also be broadened. &quot;We must put people first, promote faster progress in social programs, work energetically to solve the most practical problems that are of greatest concern to the people ... and ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development,&quot; he said. While such announcements were greeted with polite applause, the most enthusiastic response in the two-and-a-quarter hour speech came as Mr Wen delivered a stern warning to Taiwan against moves towards independence. &quot;We will unite with Taiwanese compatriots in firm opposition to all forms of secessionist activities such as calls for Taiwanese independence through legislation,&quot; he said. The comments came a day after Taiwan&apos;s president, Chen Shui-bian, long an irritant to Beijing, expressed his desire for the island&apos;s formal independence. &quot;Taiwan should be independent,&quot; the president told political supporters. &quot;Taiwan is a country whose sovereignty lies outside the People&apos;s Republic of China.&quot;  Sabre-rattling by China towards its island neighbour, which has enjoyed de facto independence since nationalist forces fled there in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong&apos;s Communists, is traditional at the start of set-piece events such as the opening of the NPC. However, Mr Chen&apos;s comments were a particularly open espousal of his pro-independence views. Beijing - which announced a 17.8% increase in military spending yesterday at the start of the NPC - has repeatedly threatened to invade Taiwan should the island make a formal declaration of independence. Mr Chen&apos;s comments, and the robust Chinese response, alarmed investors in Taiwan, which has enjoyed ever-increasing business links with the mainland in recent years.  Taipei&apos;s stock market slid 3.7% today, the largest one-day points decline in nearly three years. Among the hardest-hit stocks were those in the tourism industry, which is hoping to attract greater numbers of Chinese visitors. Any crisis over Taiwan would also have wider international implications. While Washington switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, it is obliged under US law to help Taiwan if the island is attacked, and has warned Mr Chen against provoking the mainland."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/mar/05/business.china", "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T15:45:45Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Business", "China", "Climate change", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["There were, of course, references to other pressing issues, such as social inequality, rural unrest, corruption, education, health and Taiwan - which have dominated previous opening day speeches to the congress, but the sharpest self-criticism was reserved for the government&apos;s failure to meet its green targets."], "title": "Despite new rhetoric on climate change, China is unlikely to see any real progress in environmental policies until its political system is overhauled.", "article": "Prime minister Wen Jiabao issued an environmental wake-up call in his annual report to the Chinese parliament today but it is unlikely to be heeded until the country&apos;s politics are reformed. Affirming his reputation as the greenest premier in the country&apos;s history, Mr Wen warned delegates at the National People&apos;s Congress that China&apos;s growth was unsustainable, unless the country improves energy efficiency and cuts down on pollution. The message is increasingly familiar, but it has never been given such prominence. By putting the environment at the heart of his annual report - the Chinese equivalent of the Queen&apos;s speech or the US state of the union address - Mr Wen is drawing the nation&apos;s attention to the worst consequences of its &quot;economic miracle&quot;. There were, of course, references to other pressing issues, such as social inequality, rural unrest, corruption, education, health and Taiwan - which have dominated previous opening day speeches to the congress, but the sharpest self-criticism was reserved for the government&apos;s failure to meet its green targets. &quot;We must make conserving energy, decreasing energy consumption, protecting the environment and using land intensively the breakthrough point and main fulcrum for changing the pattern of economic growth,&quot; he told the opening session. The state, he said, would shut down inefficient and dirty power plants and foundries to &quot;bring pollution under control and protect the environment&quot;. Delegates applauded politely rather than enthusiastically. Mr Wen will be used to that. Though often right, he is rarely rousing. As a speaker, his most commendable trait is a willingness to tell audiences things they would rather not hear. There is no shortage of evidence to back the premier&apos;s warnings. Beijing has one of the worst air pollution problems in the world, while 70% of China&apos;s rivers are contaminated. In the south, Himalayan glaciers are melting; in the north, encroaching deserts are threatening the livelihoods of 400 million people. If any country is faced with an imminent environmental meltdown, it is China. Yet this country has one of the least-efficient economic models in the world. It is not just a domestic issue, given the impact on global warming and increasingly scarce energy resources, China&apos;s environment might be said to pose a bigger threat to the outside world than its military, despite the concerns that were raised by Mr Wen&apos;s announcement of army modernisation. China revealed yesterday that it would increase military spending by 17.8% this year. The prime minister is rightly applauded by groups such as the World Wildlife Fund and Greenpeace for trying to make the Chinese economy leaner and greener, but beyond warnings, his powers to effect change are limited. When it comes to controlling economic growth, this authoritarian state appears to lack authority. Today, Mr Wen announced an 8% economic growth target for this year, which would be a significant slowdown from the 10% plus rate of 2006. Whether that cooling can be achieved is another matter. In recent years, government estimates have significantly undershot the true pace of expansion. Similarly, the state&apos;s environmental targets for reducing emissions and waste have proved overoptimistic. In both cases, the problem is that despite Mr Wen&apos;s fine-sounding vow to focus more on the environment, the priority of every government - central and local - is to boost businesses and jobs. The lack of political reform - a subject notable by its absence from Mr Wen&apos;s speech - is at least partly to blame. With little or no democratic accountability, the ruling class of communist cadres and bureaucrats are often closer to the polluters than to the people who suffer from a poor living environment. Corruption and cover-ups are rife, and usually found to be principle factors in major pollution spills. If the prime minister really wants to clean up China, he should start by making politics less dirty."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/mar/05/post272", "publicationDate": "2007-03-05T15:52:48Z", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Mr Honda was joined at a house subcommittee last month by three former &quot;comfort women&quot;, including Lee Yong-soo, who says she was snatched from her home in Korea when she was 15 and taken to a Japanese military brothel in Taiwan."], "title": "Japanese PM unapologetic over 'comfort women'", "article": "Sorry seems to be the hardest word for Japan&apos;s prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

In his annual report to parliament - one of the key speeches in the political calendar - Mr Wen warned that wealth creation was unsustainable without improvements in energy efficiency and reductions in pollution. Green issues were given more prominence in the address than promises on education and health, measures to ease the inequality between rich coastal cities and poor inland villages, and a verbal defence of Taiwan after a fresh flare-up in tension across the straits over the weekend. Although Mr Wen has a reputation as the most environmentally conscious member of the politburo, his comments indicated how far the environment has risen up the political agenda as the problems of water shortages, sulphurous air and global warming take an increasingly evident toll on human health. Seventy per cent of China&apos;s rivers are contaminated. Beijing is one of the most polluted cities in the world. In the south, Himalayan glaciers are melting. In the north, encroaching deserts are threatening the livelihoods of 400 million people. The deterioration of the environment is hurting social stability. Among the tens of thousands of public protests each year, pollution fears are frequently cited among the motives for mass demonstrations against new factories, dams and roads. Mr Wen said the state would shut down inefficient and dirty power plants and foundries to &quot;bring pollution under control and protect the environment&quot;. In the past, leaders have found it easier to make such promises than keep them. Mr Wen acknowledged that China had failed to meet its target of reducing pollution discharges last year. The world&apos;s most populous nation is now on course to overtake the US as the biggest producer of greenhouse gases by 2009. It is also making slow progress on reducing waste. According to the latest five-year plan, China should use 20% less energy per unit of economic output by 2010. Last year, however, it managed to improve energy efficiency by only 1%. Mr Wen said these failures were partly the fault of local governments which failed to abide by national environmental laws. &quot;We must make conserving energy, decreasing energy consumption, protecting the environment and using land intensively the breakthrough point and main fulcrum for changing the pattern of economic growth,&quot; he said in a speech lasting more than two hours at the opening session of the National People&apos;s Congress in Beijing&apos;s Great Hall of the People. The 3,000-member parliament, which meets for less than two weeks each year, performs the largely ceremonial task of rubber-stamping the budget and bills approved by the Communist party. But the prime minister&apos;s statement sets the government&apos;s direction for the year ahead and opens up opportunities for debate. Cooling the economy is proving difficult.

China has one of the world&apos;s fastest growing and most tightly censored internet markets. Last year, the number of users increased by 23% to 137 million people. In two years, it is expected to overtake the US as the biggest online population on the planet. But the authorities are increasingly concerned about the negative effects of the web, which has been blamed for school delinquency, teenage crime and youth suicide. A recent survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences found that teenagers are getting addicted to the internet at a younger age than in any other country. About 13% of users under the age of 18 played or chatted online for more than 38 hours a week - the definition of addiction. Last year, Shanghai opened the country&apos;s first shelter for addicts. Many play online games at the country&apos;s 113,000 cybercafes, which are often portrayed in the media as a breeding ground for crime. The issue has been raised at this year&apos;s National People&apos;s Congress - the Chinese parliament. &quot;It is common to see students from primary and middle schools lingering in internet bars overnight, puffing on cigarettes and engrossed in online games,&quot; NPC deputy Yu Wen was quoted as saying. In January, President Hu Jintao ordered Chinese internet regulators to promote a &quot;healthy online culture&quot; to protect social stability. Under regulations announced by the Xinhua news agency today, local governments will not be allowed to issue new internet cafe licenses this year. Businesses that have already received planning approval must be completed by June 30.

But in China, this is not the whole story. They also block news websites.&quot; He said the freeze appeared to be a new stage in a prolonged crackdown against small, independent new cybercafes, which are harder to control than large chains. &quot;At the big chains, the government can insist that IDs be shown for all users, certain words be blocked and monitoring software be installed.

England has acquired reading recovery from New Zealand and maths teaching techniques from Taiwan, Hungary and Switzerland. Elements of the US charter schools have been used in the planning of academies. Last year, the Rose review of reading recommended the universal adoption of a system of phonics developed in Scotland&apos;s smallest county, Clackmannanshire. This import of ideas from north of the border is unusual, but should, perhaps, become a trend. Scotland&apos;s school structure differs in significant ways from England&apos;s. Primary and secondary schools - often grouped together in catchment &quot;families&quot; - are maintained by 32 local authorities. These have delegated many powers to school heads and elected school boards, though not quite as many as have been given to English school governing bodies. Pupils enrol at five and remain in primary schools until they are 12. They encounter no literacy or numeracy hours or national targets. An annual survey, based on a sample rather than the test results of every pupil, is used to monitor standards in numeracy, communications, ICT, problem-solving and cooperative working. Its main findings are published - providing sound information about performance in schools while avoiding the need for league tables. Pupils spend four years in high schools, which, since the 1970s, have been almost exclusively comprehensive. More than 70% stay on post-16, normally in the same school, for a further year&apos;s study, before taking university entrance exams (highers). The curriculum is broad, and a single framework unites academic and vocational areas. Her Majesty&apos;s inspectors still flourish in Scotland, where they are recognised as the main arbiter of quality assurance. In contrast to England, the inspectors work harmoniously with local authorities and schools, and place considerable emphasis on school self-evaluation. Differences with the English system continue to grow. A recent innovation is a negotiated contract with the teachers&apos; unions. This guarantees a class contact limit of 22.5 hours a week, leaving the rest of a 35-hour working week for planning, preparation, marking and other non-teaching tasks. A recent independent survey of teachers&apos; hours reveals that the average time worked is closer to 45 hours, but the extra hours are voluntary. The latest report of the School Teachers&apos; Review Body shows that the average weekly working time for English teachers is close to 50 hours, and some secondary heads work up to 65. In the past, it has been difficult to obtain an accurate comparison of education costs. A recent Treasury analysis, however, shows that Scotland always outspends England. Moreover, a Scottish report shows that pupil-teacher ratios are four pupils fewer than the equivalent English figures, with secondary schools having ratios of one teacher to just 13 pupils. The benefits of the Scottish system reveal themselves in the latest Pisa test results for 15-year-olds. The English results, based on a reduced sample, were thought to be too unreliable to publish. But a careful analysis by a Southampton University statistics team discovered that the English sample was, in fact, better than would have occurred by chance. Even so, comparison between the two systems shows that Scotland outperforms England in literacy and maths, though not in science. The spread of the scores - indicating how successfully countries &quot;pull up&quot; their least achieving pupils - is better for Scotland. The current obsession with macho reforms, based on constant competition between pupils and between schools, does not necessarily lead to better educational outcomes. Perhaps the mandarins should take the Caledonian sleeper north. They might return with some better ideas. \u00b7 Professor Peter Mortimore is a former director of the Institute of Education, University of London"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/mar/09/sport.cricket", "publicationDate": "2007-03-09T11:12:34Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Cricket", "Cricket world cup 2007"], "sentences": ["World Cup out of tune with Taiwan sovereignty Taiwan looks like becoming the unexpected loser at the Cricket World Cup over the next month or so.", "The largest bloc of the 24 nations that continue to recognise Taiwan - whose president, Chen Shui-bian, sparked a protest from the mainland when on Sunday he reasserted that his &quot;is a sovereign, independent country&quot; - is found in the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico.", "Although the refurbishment of St Kitts &amp; Nevis&apos;s Warner Park Stadium into a 10,000-seat arena received key funding from Taiwan, the island&apos;s influence in the region is slipping.", "Grenada had to hand back a \u00a310m loan to a Taiwanese bank after receiving \u00a320m in Chinese aid to build its stadium.", "Imagine the embarrassment, then, when a Grenadian band played the Taiwanese national anthem to China&apos;s ambassador at the official handover of the project."], "title": "Digger: World Cup out of tune with Taiwan sovereignty", "article": "World Cup out of tune with Taiwan sovereignty Taiwan looks like becoming the unexpected loser at the Cricket World Cup over the next month or so.

Donatella loves this skit - &apos;You should not take yourself too seriously,&apos; she says. Her only criticism is that the comedian wears fake jewellery - &apos;I have told her,&apos; she says. Also, &apos;I wish my life was that fabulous,&apos; says Donatella, pointing out that Rudolph&apos;s caricature spends her time throwing endless parties, while she, Donatella, is a working woman. Today she is certainly grafting. First she must speak on the phone to the producer of ABC&apos;s Jimmy Kimmel Live! talk show, which she is doing tonight. Then she will be interviewed by the New Yorker, filmed in the store by Access Hollywood, the daily entertainment news programme, and have her picture taken for the Los Angeles Times. Then it&apos;s back to the bungalow to get ready for Kimmel, her first-ever talk-show appearance. The tardy Isabelle arrives, haring up the store&apos;s central black-marble staircase. &apos;Be careful,&apos; says Donatella. &apos;Remember Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?&apos; Then it&apos;s through back rooms and corridors to a tiny office, where above the hum of the computers and amid stacks of shoe boxes and a couple of $6,000 gowns hung on the back of the door, Donatella calls the producer of tonight&apos;s TV show on speakerphone. An assistant brings in a huge crystal ashtray with the company&apos;s Medusa emblem engraved on the bottom, and a glass of water. Donatella tells the man on the end of the line that she is very nervous - she&apos;s not a TV or movie star. He reassures her and then runs through the kind of things that may come up tonight. Prince will be there at her event on Thursday, right? So did she see him perform last night at half-time at the Superbowl? Yes, he was amazing. Did she watch the game? No, she likes real football - at which Italy are the world champions. Does she mind the Maya Rudolph sketches on Saturday Night Live? No, not at all, they&apos;re very funny. When she comes to LA for three days, how many bags does she bring? &apos;You really want to know?&apos; she asks. Then waits a beat before deadpanning: &apos;Fourteen.&apos; The producer is happy - respond like that tonight and you&apos;ll be fine, he says, and let Jimmy the host do the heavy lifting, that&apos;s what he&apos;s paid for. She hangs up and is ushered out into a large stockroom. Here she talks to the woman from the New Yorker, answering questions while keeping half an eye on three giraffe-like models who walk up and down in flowing Versace frocks. They are the props for her next TV slot. The hair is too long, she says, it should be trimmed, and she marks the line on the extravagant hair extensions with her hand. The style is straight, with a centre parting, just like she wears her own. Gianni used to dress her up, like a doll; now it seems she is cloning herself. Donatella was born in Reggio di Calabria in southern Italy in 1955. She was the youngest of three siblings and was clearly something of a pet to elder brothers Gianni and Santo. Ingrid Sischy, the editor of Andy Warhol&apos;s Interview magazine and an old family friend, describes how Gianni would drive them to the only disco in Calabria with Donatella aged 14, bouncing up and down with excitement on the back seat, wearing white go-go boots. It was Gianni who, according to Rupert Everett, &apos;turned her blonde late one night when she was just 11 years old&apos;. The bond between the fashion-obsessed Gianni and his little sister was particularly strong - Everett calls it &apos;a locking of energy fields&apos; - and as he moved north to Milan to pursue his career as a designer, Donatella followed him (after completing a degree in languages at the university of Florence), first to assist with photo shoots and then to design her own collection for him. It seems Gianni so trusted her that he would frequently consult her, and soon the press was casting her in the role of muse. So when Gianni was murdered on the steps of his Miami South Beach villa in 1997, it seemed obvious that she would take over. And sure enough, with what seemed to be relatively little fuss at the time, the transition was made. This was, after all, an Italian family business: the King was dead, long live the Queen. And yet the succession proved to be anything but easy. Gianni Versace was quite simply a very hard act to follow. At his funeral, Elton John sat with Diana, Princess of Wales. Back at the Luxe Hotel, Demi Moore stands naked in the suite which has been hired for outfitting the speakers for Thursday night&apos;s ceremony. Sharon Stone sits in jeans and a T-shirt, chatting to Demi&apos;s assistant and drinking tea. The Versace dresser, Lucio, fetches Moore&apos;s long black evening gown with black sequins, which the actor will wear to present Gianni Versace&apos;s Walk of Style statuette to Elton John, who will accept it on behalf of the late designer. Sharon Stone will wear the long black jersey dress with chains which she has just tried on. Sharon Stone doesn&apos;t do autocues. She likes to &apos;speak spontaneously on the moment&apos;. Turns out she&apos;s quite the public speaker, even hosted a Nobel Peace Prize concert, so at the Versace event she&apos;s just going to rap. &apos;I&apos;m going to say how much I love Donatella, how long I&apos;ve known her, how we&apos;ve all been through our ups and downs together, and we&apos;ve made it together. How much we want her to know we&apos;re here for her - that we&apos;re her friends.&apos; The ups and downs she is alluding to could be characterised as Donatella&apos;s wilderness years. The young Versace sister was always something of a party animal. The discos in Calabria gave way to wild rock&apos;n&apos;roll gatherings at the family&apos;s residences. Rupert Everett recalls first meeting her with Gianni at the house&apos;s palazzo at Via Gesu in Milan more than 20 years ago: &apos;He was a shy poet dreamer. He didn&apos;t speak much English. He had a thick black beard, piercing blue eyes and an unruly mop of hair. She was a kamikaze blonde in black leather and stilettos, more like a character from Blade Runner than the stately doyenne of a Milanese fashion house.&apos; While Gianni was alive, Donatella could enjoy herself in the knowledge her elder brother shouldered all the responsibility. But after his death, grief and taking on the Versace mantle proved too much and she took refuge in booze and drugs. The collections suffered - she has talked of feeling as if she was &apos;impersonating&apos; her brother - the sales fell and in a business where perception is nine-tenths of reality, rumour had the firm close to folding. Then, three years ago, Donatella checked herself into rehab, kicked her habits (apart from the ciggies) and found her creative voice. In doing so, she put both herself and the brand on the road to recovery. If Thursday night is a tribute to founder Gianni&apos;s unique flair, then it is also a celebration of one of the fashion industry&apos;s great comeback stories. &apos;I did it for myself, first,&apos; she says today of her decision to sort herself out. &apos;You can&apos;t do it for another reason. I was clear I wasn&apos;t functioning, I knew I was hurting people. And if I wasn&apos;t functioning, nothing around me was functioning - I was aware of that.&apos; She had help from her friends - she couldn&apos;t take time out for extensive regular treatment. With regard to sobriety, she says, &apos;Of course you can never say never, I&apos;ll never go back - but I am a black or white person.&apos; She has resolve. &apos;I like myself a little bit more now - if you don&apos;t like yourself, you want to hurt yourself.&apos; That evening Donatella is collected from her hotel by her English driver. She is accompanied, as she is everywhere, by four burly men in black suits. They look like bodyguards, but only one is. The others are her personal assistant, Bruce, a ponytailed Frenchman with impeccable manners; Dean, an Australian hairstylist, and Renato, an Italian make-up artist. It is said they are her extended family. They travel in a three-car motorcade down Sunset Boulevard. Donatella sits in the back of her Mercedes in a black leather jacket and says: &apos;Now I am nervous - I don&apos;t remember a thing I said on the phone.&apos; She lights a cigarette. The Mercs pull into the car park at the back of the old El Capitan theatre, where the Kimmel show is recorded. In the neon-lit gloom, a line of fans shout for Donatella&apos;s attention from behind crash barriers, but she is walked briskly down corridors by her suited escorts like something out of 24. The only thing spoiling the presidential feel of the moment is the fact that Renato is carrying a small pink make-up bag as he brings up the rear. In the green room, Donatella sits in front of a make-up mirror bordered by bare light bulbs. Her people arrange the delivery of a small Versace bag containing the gift of a tie to the show&apos;s host, while she calls her daughter Allegra, on her mobile. Allegra Versace is something of an enigma. She has never given an interview, and studiously keeps herself out of the public eye - unlike Gianni&apos;s other niece, Francesca, brother Santo&apos;s daughter, who since she came to London to study fashion at Central Saint Martins has become something of an It-girl about town. But then, Allegra&apos;s situation is somewhat different. When Gianni died, his will came as quite a shock - instead of leaving the business to his brother and sister, he bequeathed 50 per cent of it to his niece Allegra, 30 per cent to brother Santo and 20 per cent to sister Donatella. (Allegra&apos;s brother Daniel got the art collection.) Donatella Versace is every inch the proud mother: &apos;I worked up to half an hour before the birth,&apos; she says, and laughs as she tells the story about how, after her Caesarean section, Gianni was on the phone saying: &apos;Why aren&apos;t you back? We&apos;ve got a show to do.&apos; Now 20 years old, Allegra sits on the board as she completes her studies and, according to her mother, is not shy about expressing her opinion. &apos;She loves fashion, she is a fashionista,&apos; says Donatella. &apos;It is her reviews that kill me - she says: &quot;That&apos;s old.&quot; It kills me.&apos; Back at the ABC network late show, a sound engineer appears and suddenly the diminutive fashion designer is smothered in a huddle of towering fussing men as her assistant shines ...#8594; ...#8592; two torches down her cleavage to find a way of attaching a mic to her black bodice. Job done, she is taken out on stage, where she banters with her host, a kind of Jonathan Ross on steroids, who admires his tie. Her fellow guest Dominic Monaghan, the Mancunian star of Lost, tells her off camera that his girlfriend, Evangeline Lilly, loves her clothes. The audience is clearly on her side, and laughs encouragingly as Kimmel plays regular guy to her glamorous Italian. He shows pictures of celebrities in Versace, including Jennifer Lopez in the infamously low-cut jungle dress. What did she say when she saw it, asks Kimmel. &apos;She said, &quot;Don&apos;t you think it is a bit much?&quot;&apos; reports his guest. When Donatella leaves, she poses graciously with the casually dressed crowd waiting by the car park and signs autographs before stepping into her ride. If anyone looked closely enough, they&apos;d see that her number plate reads DIVA 11. At the Versace shop the next day a neat man in a dark blue suit, shirt and tie sits like a fastidious Bond villain on a white Versace home-collection armchair embroidered with the distinctive zigzag Greek fret motif, which, like the Medusa symbol, has become a shorthand for the brand. This is Giancarlo Di Risio, Versace&apos;s CEO. Di Risio is, along with the refocused Donatella, very much at the core of what insiders call &apos;New Versace&apos;. Appointed by the family triumvirate of shareholders - Allegra, her mother Donatella and her uncle Santo - his brief was to take the company back into profit. His main strategy has been to convert Versace from being run like an Italian family business, all internal politics and grace and favour, to having the rigorous structure and methodology of a corporation. At the end of last year Di Risio announced that the three-year target to profitability he set himself had been smashed in half the time. Today he reveals an aggressive plan for expansion, including five more stores in America by 2010. Last week Versace opened in Taiwan, and by the end of the year there will be 10 more Versace boutiques in China. Then to prove that he&apos;s not just a bland bread-head, Di Risio explains some of his new wheezes. Versace is now designing interiors for private jets. And Lamborghinis. And Di Risio is going to have the Medusa emblem illuminated in the glass dome that sits atop the Rodeo Drive store so that it can be seen from space. Donatella Versace sits in Bungalow 1A of the Beverly Hills Hotel, the city&apos;s famous Pink Palace, waiting for the press. Having had the corporate news from the man in the suit, the scribes are scheduled to get their one-on-one slots with the lady in the bustier. She has been coming to this legendary pile, built in 1912, with its old Hollywood charm, its flamingos, its 12 acres of lush tropical gardens and secluded bungalows, for some 18 years now. &apos;I feel at home here,&apos; she says. She talks fondly of how Allegra &apos;was two-and-a-half when she came here, and she learnt how to swim here, in the pool&apos;. The journos arrive in a seemingly endless stream and are admitted by a PR girl at half-hourly intervals into a living room thick with the intimacy of scented candles. They sit facing her, sofa-to-sofa. She parries question after question. She is polished, like a Wimbledon champion having a knockabout with some young hopefuls. Her performance throughout the afternoon is sharp and controlled. Only once does she seem to drop her guard. Asked about the difficulty of combining her professional and personal lives, she answers: &apos;If you are thrown into a place like this, you have to say no to some things. My work is very demanding. My family is very demanding. I try to give quality time to my children, not quantity time. I hope it works.&apos; When the last journalist has gone she closes her eyes. &apos;I am so tired I could go to sleep.&apos; She is curled up on the sofa recalling the aftermath of Gianni&apos;s murder and how quickly she was thrust into the spotlight. &apos;It was July, and in October there was a show.&apos; She was in shock and grieving. &apos;I was sobbing in private, people were looking at me asking, &quot;What shall we do?&quot; I had to keep it hidden from everybody - even my own family. Because everything was falling apart.&apos; And things got worse. &apos;Many things happened in my life - it was a mess.&apos; &apos;In the beginning I was so tortured,&apos; she says. &apos;People wanted to see Gianni, but if I try to show Gianni, it was not Gianni enough. But if I try to be different - &quot;What is she doing?&quot;&apos; It changed, she says, &apos;when I got clear in my mind&apos;. But early on, &apos;Everything was compared with Gianni - Gianni, Gianni, Gianni.&apos; She explains how she decided to break with the past. &apos;I used to push him to change, change, change. So I&apos;m going to change.&apos; So there is a new look at Versace: &apos;Women want to be beautiful, sensual, glamorous - but not overly sexy,&apos; she says. And how does it differ from what Gianni was doing? &apos;Less aggression - I like women who don&apos;t look like they try too hard. Looking natural in clothes, in make-up - it&apos;s just a look. It&apos;s much more difficult to do sophisticated clothes, without the embroidery and details and strong colours.&apos; Half an hour later the mayor of Beverly Hills, Stephen P Webb, is inducting Donatella Versace and her late brother into the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style at an open-air ceremony. He also announces that there is an open-air exhibition of Mario Testino photographs for Versace throughout the city, mounted on lampposts, and proclaims this, &apos;the week of 4 February 2007, to be Versace Week&apos;. At the cocktail party which follows the mayoral address - held at the Versace store - a tall, ruggedly handsome man in a dark Versace suit watches as Donatella is photographed again and again in the familiar celebrity clinch: standing, smiling, butted up against first one grinning acolyte and then another. This is Paul Beck, Donatella&apos;s husband and the father of her two children. Married in 1987, they have been separated for six years but remain close. An American, Beck is something of a dude - he&apos;s been making plans to go surfing early on the morning after the Walk of Style bash. And he is still very much involved with the house, heading up the office in New York. This is a circus - surely it&apos;s not something you ever get used to? &apos;No,&apos; says Beck, &apos;but I feel there&apos;s a good energy now since we restructured. It&apos;s like 1984, when we were building.&apos; It&apos;s the big day and the celebrities are gearing up. Demi Moore is working on her speech. She has to introduce Elton and present him with Gianni&apos;s award and has decided to talk about Elton and Gianni&apos;s special relationship. She will run with the idea of Gianni as a great son, brother, uncle and a loyal friend. This is all quite weird for her. She attended Gianni&apos;s last-ever couture show and joined him afterwards. &apos;I sat next to him at dinner,&apos; she says, &apos;and one of his last correspondences was with me.&apos; Two days after that show, he was murdered. Rupert Everett lounges in a high-backed wing armchair in Donatella&apos;s bungalow in a black suit and white shirt. Bruce, her assistant, is there in a shiny silver-grey suit. Donatella is getting ready for lunch. Prince has gone Awol. &apos;Why not call him?&apos; says Bruce. &apos;I should call him and say, &quot;Hello Prince, are you coming tonight?&quot; I don&apos;t want to do that.&apos; Moments later they are seated in a private room off the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel, at a table set for 21. It is like some fashion-world last supper. Donatella eats her sea bass next to Everett. The other guests are journalists. They are being well looked after - Versace has even laid on a hairdresser for the international press for this evening. The moment it wraps she&apos;s up again, and it&apos;s back to Bungalow 1A, where some orchids have been delivered from Mario Testino with a note expressing his apologies for not being able to come (the place is beginning to resemble a florist&apos;s). She ducks into her bedroom in gold, and three minutes later emerges in skin-tight black, picks up her shiny white Versace handbag, which has been checked by her bodyguard for tissues, phone, etc, and is off for her next appointment. As party time nears, the bungalow becomes a hub of activity. Donatella&apos;s acceptance speech is printed out and mounted on cards; Everett arrives and sits reworking his words at the desk; Donatella gets made up and appears, hair curled, in a white-towelling dressing gown (&apos;Now you have seen all my looks!&apos;), and there are calls from Naomi&apos;s people, Cindy&apos;s people, Demi&apos;s people, all asking for last-minute changes to be made to the official script. Finally it is time to go, and Donatella sets off for the red-carpet parade at City Hall, looking like some kind of mermaid in a deeply scalloped evening gown. She won&apos;t be over-dressed - the place is rammed with the great and the good in head-to-toe Versace. The roll call reads like a PR&apos;s dream: Christina Ricci, Courtney Love, Quincy Jones, Drew Barrymore, Eva Longoria, Jennifer Lopez, Kanye West, Penelope Cruz, Juliette Lewis, Brooke Shields, Jada Pinkett, Mary J Blige, Jennifer Hudson, and on and on. Oh, and Mr Prince. The evening goes off without a hitch. The stars shine fabulously on the red carpet; Sharon Stone auctions a one-off Versace-designed Lamborghini Murcielago Roadster for the Elton John Aids Foundation (it fetches $500,000); the supermodels are super; Elton plays and sings in fine form; Guns N&apos; Roses rock and knock, knock, knock on heaven&apos;s door, and Donatella dedicates her award to her children. Everybody is happy - the PR girls, the celebrity &apos;wranglers&apos; hired to seat the demanding horde, the sponsors, the TV crews, the journalists (fresh from their appointments with the hairdresser), the mayor, the Rodeo Drive Walk of Style committee. While LA&apos;s trendiest DJ, Samantha Ronson, does her stuff, a small blonde mermaid scuttles out, accompanied by four big guys in black suits, one of whom carries a small, gold make-up bag."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/mar/13/news1", "publicationDate": "2007-03-13T09:28:51Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["In Greece, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan, it accounted for over 50% of cinema tickets sold."], "title": "Grant and Barrymore make sweet music at the box office", "article": "Music &amp; Lyrics, the romantic comedy starring Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore, hit all the right notes at the worldwide box-office this week to reach the number one spot.

The fighting began when 500 armed police tried to enter villages in the Nandigram area, 80 miles south of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), to be met by farmers and activists armed with sickles and machetes behind barricades of upturned vehicles and palm-logs. It was the first time police had tried to gain access since January, when clashes left six people dead. &quot;My men came under fire and were attacked with home-made bombs. They came out firing and my officers returned fire,&quot; Inspector-General Raj Kanojia said. The state&apos;s Communist government has ordered some 22,000 acres (9,000 hectares) to be turned over to a special economic zone for an Indonesian-owned petrochemical complex. Such zones would, like those in China, offer industry tax- and duty-free areas free from government red tape. The impetus lies with India&apos;s desire to match China&apos;s lightning and sustained economic growth. However, China&apos;s three-decade-long race for development has left at least 40 million landless peasants, generating much resentment in the countryside which often boils over. Despite their rapid economic growth India and China still rely on the land to provide for hundreds of millions of poor farmers. The cost of such special zones to the Indian taxpayer is put at 1,750bn rupees (\u00a321bn) by 2011. However, the government has said the benefits are considerable, and would bring in \u00a37bn in investment and create almost a million jobs. &quot;This is not a very good way of creating jobs,&quot; said Shankar Archarya, a central government economic adviser. &quot;It would be better to do away with India&apos;s labour laws. Even in [special economic zones] you will not be able to shut down a factory with 100 workers in it without government permission ... the Chinese do not have the same labour restrictions.&quot; The corporate subsidies have attracted international interest. Since it passed a law in 2005 approving the zones the government has approved 60 sites, although the earlier violence in West Bengal had put a further 300 applications on hold. Many plots are for luxury private housing and for software companies keen to buy new premises. One zone in West Bengal aims to build a &quot;people&apos;s car&quot; which would cost less than \u00a31,500. The violence has prompted questions as to whether India&apos;s democracy can sustain the pursuit of a Chinese-style industrial revolution. Once the zones have been approved, farmland is bought, sometimes through compulsory state acquisitions. &quot;You are telling a poor tiller of the land that his livelihood will disappear and that if you wait for 15 years he might get a job in a new factory. It is not going to be acceptable,&quot; said Ashok Mitra, a former chief economic adviser. Some experts say the compensation scheme has only bought off landowners and not the peasants who work the land. The Indian Statistics Institute said a landlord received 1.3m rupees an acre in West Bengal while sharecroppers only received a quarter of that sum, with agricultural labourers granted nothing. &quot;No wonder you have a peasant uprising,&quot; said the institute&apos;s Professor Abhirup Sarkar. &quot;It is bad economics and looks like bad politics too.&quot; Special economic zones Special economic zones are a US invention. In 1947 Washington boosted the prospects of Puerto Rico, which is part of the US Commonwealth, with industrial parks that attracted tax breaks. In the 1960s SEZs helped Taiwan grow from rural backwater to chip-maker to the world. Zones cropped up in Singapore and Korea in the 1970s and 80s. In Mexico maquiladoras - tariff-free factories - send billions of dollars of goods across the US border and are credited with creating a million jobs in a decade. China opened its first SEZ in 1980.

Sheraz Daya, a consultant ophthalmic surgeon and director of the corneoplastic unit at Queen Victoria hospital, East Grinstead, Sussex, has treated four patients born with aniridia by transplanting into their eyes cells grown from those of dead donors. The stem cell transplants trigger production of new cells in the patients, leading to the hope that such techniques could help grow even hearts and livers. Since 2000, Mr Daya has used the treatment on about 40 patients who lost their sight through chemical accidents. But the technique is now proving effective when applied to people with aniridia, a condition affecting up to 1,000 people in the UK. Aniridia results in near blindness since the limbal cells that keep the surface of the cornea clear and healthy are missing or few in number. Mr Daya takes a donor&apos;s limbal cells then grows them on in a laboratory. A sheet of the cells is placed over the patient&apos;s cornea, held by an amniotic membrane from donated placentas.

But when we met in London earlier this week, the co-founder of Maps (Mail Abuse Prevention Service), one of the first spam-busting organisations, was animated as he talked about the importance of getting users - that means you, the reader - and particularly internet service providers - that means the people who you, the reader, pay for your internet connection - to get serious about spam. If your connection comes from BT, then there&apos;s particular reason to be concerned. Rand is still fighting spam, now as chief technology officer of Trend Micro (which in 2005 bought his anti-spam outfit Kelkea, which had bought Maps). &quot;If we could get just the top 20 ISPs to coordinate on blocking spam, then we could reduce the volume by two orders of magnitude.&quot; That is, by more than a hundredfold. Rand points to Trend Micro&apos;s site which shows estimated spam volume by ISP in just the past 24 hours. When I looked at it, Telecom Italia was racing away with the title, having been the source of 1.5bn spams in the previous 24 hours; China&apos;s Chinanet meanwhile was struggling to compete with 1.2bn. It&apos;s a woeful list. And there at number 20 is BT&apos;s regional network, home to a tidy 162m spams. We have written at length about the problems with spam and why most of the ideas that the average person has to &quot;solve&quot; it don&apos;t, and never will, work. Rand, given his long history, knows that technology alone can&apos;t work; but equally, ISPs can do a huge amount to stop people getting infected by the malware that causes spam and warning people when their machines begin sending spam. The simplest would be to identify the IP address from which spam comes, alert the ISP and make sure that the next time that machine logs on that any attempt to browse the web leads to a page saying something like: &quot;Your machine has been identified as a source of spam, please do the following.&quot; Listening to Rand, it occurred to me that spam is the global warming of the web: its rise threatens the very way in which we go about our online business, with some local effects that are very focused (there are ISPs that simply don&apos;t accept any email originating from China, Taiwan or Korea; tough luck if you&apos;ve got a friend or child out there) and others that are more diffuse (email with certain words in the subject line, or even message, will sink beneath the filters trying to protect you from online naughtiness). Yet like global warming, spam could be tackled - at a cost. The trouble is that, just as with the global warming problem, people don&apos;t like the associated cost and the upheaval that implementing it represents. For you and me, it would mean paying a bit more per month for our internet connection. For ISPs, it would mean being more diligent about what sort of traffic they accept from each other: only taking email on port 587, as we discussed last year (What else can we do to stop the spammers?, November 23 2006), wins Rand&apos;s backing. He notes that there aren&apos;t that many ISPs - probably fewer than 20,000 - and so it shouldn&apos;t be impossible to get them to implement a system that would protect them and their clients. Of course, you would think that getting governments and politicians to act, rather than blather, on global warming and climate change would be comparatively easy too. Anybody who has watched Al Gore&apos;s double Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, can see that doing nothing is not an option; the problem demands political action. But it&apos;s still lacking; nobody grasps the nettle. Similarly, while spam hardly has the power to drown livelihoods and lead to millions of refugees, it creates an unsettled environment in which nothing can be relied on to be the same tomorrow as today. And if we can&apos;t sort out spam, then one does have to start feeling gloomy about our ability to tackle something that involves so much more self-interest, such as burning fossil fuels. \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/16/china", "publicationDate": "2007-03-16T10:26:37Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Prior to the opening of the NPC, Taiwan&apos;s president, Chen Shui-bian, angered China by again talking of possible independence for the island, which split from the mainland in 1949 and which Beijing promises to invade if it formally secedes.", "&quot;We will never allow anyone to change the history, the reality and the universally recognised legal status of Taiwan - that is Taiwan has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory since ancient times,&quot; Mr Wen said."], "title": "New law strengthens China's private property rights", "article": "China today took a further step away from its communist past as parliament passed legislation strengthening private property rights for individuals and companies. The highly symbolic law - which also removed preferential tax rates for foreign companies operating in China - was overwhelmingly passed by the National People&apos;s Congress (NPC) on the final day of its annual two-week session in Beijing. Despite the huge majority - 2,799 delegates voted in favour with 52 opposed and 37 abstaining - the law is controversial. It had been vigorously opposed by a small but influential group of scholars and retired officials, who described it as a move towards unrestrained privatisation that would further widen social divisions. The law, which has been debated for 14 years, effectively puts the final, official seal on the way China&apos;s still officially communist economic system has been transformed by private enterprise and foreign investment over the past three decades. The economy is increasingly dominated by the private sector, which now accounts for 65% percent of China&apos;s gross national product. Along with private businesses, the new law also aims to bolster the rights of homebuyers who have pushed the urban home ownership rate to more than 80%. It is also intended to help farmers who have frequently lost their land to infrastructure and housing projects with little or no compensation.  The tax law unifies the tax rate for foreign-financed companies with those of Chinese enterprises at 25%, ending an era that saw China create special economic and technology zones with lower taxes.  This year&apos;s NPC session was marked by promises from the Chinese leadership to tackle the growing gap between the rich and poor. Wen Jiabao, the Chinese prime minister, emphasised that aim in his closing speech to the parliament today, saying the Communist party needed to focus on those left behind by the economic boom. &quot;The priorities now are promoting equality in education opportunities, adopting progressive employment policies, narrowing income gaps and building social security networks that cover both the cities and the countryside,&quot; he said.  In a two-hour press conference he also said the world should not be afraid of China&apos;s increasing military might. In January, the country&apos;s military successfully tested an anti-satellite space weapon, and a 17.8% increase in military spending has been announced. &quot;China always advocates for the peaceful utilisation of outer space, and we are always opposed to an arms race in outer space,&quot; Mr Wen said. Prior to the opening of the NPC, Taiwan&apos;s president, Chen Shui-bian, angered China by again talking of possible independence for the island, which split from the mainland in 1949 and which Beijing promises to invade if it formally secedes. &quot;We will never allow anyone to change the history, the reality and the universally recognised legal status of Taiwan - that is Taiwan has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory since ancient times,&quot; Mr Wen said. He said China was willing to talk with the Dalai Lama &quot;as long as he recognises that Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory ... and as long as the Dalai Lama gives up his efforts to split the country&quot;. China has occupied Tibet in an often brutal fashion since invading it in 1951.

As we know, the web ads market is booming - up 82% in the US last year to $410m. according to eMarketer. Viacom has 28 TV networks and 44 US websites, but critically wants to manage its own relationships with its advertisers. Systematically requesting that it content is removed from YouTube places a huge burden on the company, it says.

Outsourcing has been accused of having any of number of disastrous consequences for the global labour market - but only now has it emerged that it may also be helping scramble the minds of the world&apos;s moviegoers. According to disgruntled British translators, the problem is that the studios&apos; preference for cheap subtitles produced in India and Malaysia is making a nonsense of English language films abroad.  Frustrated at seeing what are already low wages forced down still further, native subtitlers have begun compiling examples of the errors littering British and American movies released in foreign markets. And from their research, there certainly seems no shortage of cases where literal-minded or just plain odd translations have rendered Hollywood movies incomprehensible (or, if we&apos;re going to be honest about this, more incomprehensible). In Taiwan, for example, audiences enjoying My Super Ex-Girlfriend (the Ivan Reitman comedy starring Uma Thurman) had a line describing a zero-tolerance policy on sexual harassment relayed to them as &quot;We hold the highest standards for sexual harassment&quot;. Elsewhere, Chinese Anne Hathaway fans taking in The Princess Diaries 2 will have been given a strange insight into western culture, when a mention of David Attenborough was subtitled as Sherlock Holmes (something I find only becomes more puzzling the longer I think about it). Vietnam vets have become veterinarians from Vietnam; spaceships in sci-fi films have been warned of the hazards of looming fields of steroids. All of which does seem to prove the translators&apos; point that a proper job of subtitling needs a degree of cultural context and linguistic nuance, something which the studios&apos; cost cutting seems ill-equipped to provide. Quite apart from issues of fair wages, there&apos;s also the fact that foreign audiences surely deserve to see movies the way they were intended to be seen. At the climax of a high-octane thriller, the difference between &quot;Stop! He&apos;s got a gun!&quot; and &quot;Stop! He&apos;s got some gum&quot; could, you might imagine, be of no small importance. Perhaps we need to throw our weight firmly behind Britain&apos;s subtitlers, not out of patriotism, but simply as cinephiles. After all, would you want the pivotal line of Francis Ford Coppola&apos;s meditation on war, Apocalypse Now, to have been given to you as &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning - smells like Viscounts&quot;?

Working with primates has a long history of producing strong, even iconoclastic, personalities - from Jane Goodall to Diane Fosse and Karl Amman - and Cronin, an irascible, headstrong and passionate man, was no exception. Born of Irish-Italian parents, he was brought up on the banks of the Hudson river in Yonkers, near New York. After graduating from St Denis school and Lincoln high school, he took odd jobs as a lift constructor and a removals man before, quite literally, falling into primatology. An accident while moving a grand piano left him with his leg in traction, and when he recovered he took a job looking after the primates at the Bronx zoo. In 1980, he moved to Britain to take up a job at Howletts Wild Animal Park, near Canterbury, Kent, where the owner, John Aspinall (obituary, June 30 2000), was busy rewriting the rules on keeping gorillas in captivity. Instead of washing down concrete floors with disinfectant and segregating animals, Aspinall kept them on thick beds of hay in large family groups. The result was spectacular breeding success. Cronin thrived in this unconventional environment and set up a primate breeding programme under Aspinall&apos;s auspices despite his lack of academic qualifications. After seven years at Howletts, Cronin&apos;s streak of zealous anger about the fate of captive chimps - combined with a natural showmanship - led him to start rescuing orphan chimpanzees being used by Spanish beach photographers. Early undercover television footage reveals his refusal to back down in the face of physical and verbal assaults and, all too often, official indifference. At the beginning of this crusade, Cronin bought a plot of gravelly heathland, a former pig farm, at Wareham, Dorset. He got planning permission to build his first enclosures, and in 1987 opened Monkey World. Initially, it became home to nine rescued chimps. At the last count, it was home to 160 primates from 13 countries, including the largest group of chimpanzees outside Africa and the most important breeding group of Borneo Orangs outside Borneo. Learning from his experience at Howletts, Cronin wrote his own rules on what Monkey World was to be. Enclosures at the 65-acre sanctuary were spacious and designed using wood, mats and rope. He described the physically and emotionally scarred chimps - some tortured with cigarette butts, force-fed tranquilisers, isolated and beaten - as having the same psychological problems as abused humans. They needed to learn to trust again, and required careful rehabilitation before integration into family groups. An initial decision was taken not to breed - the abused chimps would have been poor mothers - and Monkey World was one of the pioneers in primate birth control, including slow-release implants. The growing success of Monkey World, which now attracts half a million visitors a year, acted as a springboard for Cronin&apos;s rescue and recovery campaigns around the world, from Turkey to Taiwan. High-profile schemes such as Adopt a Chimp and Cronin&apos;s typically up-front and forceful lobbying of people like prime minister Margaret Thatcher about the illegal trade in chimpanzees soon brought him to the attention of television programme-makers. This interest culminated in the long-running Animal Planet series, Monkey Business, first transmitted in 1997, a popular animal docu-soap about day-to-day life at Monkey World, which has been shown all round the world. Cronin&apos;s larger-than-life approach, his endless campaigning and bolshiness inevitably led to comparisons with other TV wildlife personalities, such as Australian Steve Irwin (obituary, September 5 2006), although he never quite achieved the same celebrity status or notoriety. His forthrightness also earned him some enemies in the primatology world, although few doubted his passion and conviction. In 1993 Cronin met Alison Ames, a fellow American and a behavioural expert who had studied biological anthropology at Cambridge University. She arrived at Monkey World to discuss fencing techniques and the couple married in 1996. They ran Monkey World as a joint operation, coordinating rescue missions around the world, running campaigns against the animal smuggling trade and co-starring in television series. In 2006 Cronin was awarded an MBE for services to animal welfare. He is survived by Alison, his daughter Eleanor from his first marriage, mother Margaret, brother John and sister Deborah. It is understood his ashes will be returned for burial to the sanctuary he founded. \u00b7 James Michael Cronin, conservationist and campaigner, born November 15 1951; died March 17 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/mar/25/fashion.retail", "publicationDate": "2007-03-25T13:24:09Z", "tags": ["Fashion", "Life and style", "Retail industry", "Communities", "Business", "Society", "UK news", "Burberry", "Plaid Cymru"], "sentences": ["There have been news stories as far afield as India, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan."], "title": "Squaring up to Burberry", "article": "She&apos;s not much of a tour guide, my mum. We&apos;re taking a drive around the Rhondda Valley, or valleys, because there are two of them - Rhondda Fawr, or big Rhondda and Rhondda Fach, little Rhondda - and she&apos;s pointing out the sights. &apos;That used to be a factory, there. It was opened by the Secretary of State. Now what was his name? I can&apos;t even remember what they made now? Was it cartons? Or tyres, maybe?&apos; We drive up through the stop-start traffic lights and her rhetorical questions keep coming, past the rows of terraced houses, and the huge, semi-derelict chapels surpassed in size only by the towering working-men&apos;s institutes. &apos;The cathedrals of the valley,&apos; according to my mum. Theoretically, we&apos;re on a tour of what little industry there is left and theoretically my mum, who used to find work experience placements for every 14-year-old in the valley, should be a bit of an expert on the matter. But by the time we reach Maerdy, at the head of the Rhondda Fach, my mother is clutching desperately at historical straws. &apos;It used to be known as Little Moscow around here,&apos; she says. &apos;Do you remember the march when they came back after the miner&apos;s strike with the banners and the bands?&apos; I was 15 then and only really remember it from the telly. Although having spent two days talking to soon-to-be-unemployed Burberry workers it&apos;s almost impossible not to make comparisons between then and now: there&apos;s the same end-of-an-era whiff in the air and for the second time in 20 years the Rhondda is at the centre of a fiercely fought industrial dispute. There&apos;s differences, mind. Back in the Eighties the chief mode of attack was the flying pickets. These days the most effective weapon is widely held to be a celebrity endorsement. It&apos;s manufacturing this time rather than coal because on 31 March, barring any last-minute interventions, the Burberry factory, the last factory of any note in the Rhondda Valley, employing 309 workers, will close. And the jobs will go to China. There&apos;s a couple of double- glazing outfits still going and that&apos;s it. The coal has gone, the factories have gone, the jobs have gone. All that&apos;s left is people. You&apos;d never build a town in Treorchy these days, but the factory, built in 1939, is there because the people were there. And the people were there because the coal was there. Even when I was a child, the rivers ran black, and vast slag heaps towered above the towns. They&apos;re greened over now, but the scars of its industrial past are everywhere - great chunks missing from the hillsides and places where the coal dust glitters through the topsoil still. It should be depressing, all this, but unexpectedly, it&apos;s not. Or at least, not quite. The South Wales valleys might have become a byword for the decline in Britain&apos;s industry but it&apos;s not some faceless Sixties suburb - it&apos;s still home to some of the most dramatic scenery in Britain. There&apos;s a mountain stream that runs outside the factory door, a mile up the valley there are waterfalls gushing out of the hillside. And even the soon-to-be ex-workers have a little bit of the joy of spring about them. &apos;We had lunch on Monday, you see, at Harrods with Mr Al Fayed,&apos; the shop steward Joan Young tells me, &apos;and we&apos;re still on a high.&apos; (Al Fayed recently declared to whoever would listen that the workers could make products for Harrods.) Joan is one of the lead organisers of the surprisingly high-profile &apos;Keep Burberry British&apos; campaign, the Treorchy factory workers&apos; protest against the closure. &apos;He was so welcoming. &apos;Eat as much as you can!&apos; he said. And &apos;Go on, get drunk!&apos; There was everything you could think of: smoked salmon, lobster, three types of roast.&apos; In any other circumstances the fact that Mohammed Al Fayed had stepped into a British industrial dispute would be a dramatic new turn. But in this instance it&apos;s simply another twist in a global media campaign that has seen Joan and her fellow workers appear on TV news broadcasts in Japan, America, France, and Australia. There have been news stories as far afield as India, Romania, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. The Wall Street Journal and the FT have editorialised on the matter, a Commons Select Committee has summoned Burberry&apos;s CEO, Angela Ahrendts, to answer questions, Prince Charles wrote to the board, and demonstrators have gathered in front of film crews outside Burberry shops in London, Paris, New York, LA, Las Vegas and Chicago. Then there are the celebrities. Without them, this would have been a small-scale dispute in a valley far away. With them, the trade union movement has received its biggest shot in the arm for a long while. Joan is 54 and has worked at Burberry&apos;s for 26 years, since she was 15, with a break to have a family. She&apos;s broadly typical of the women who work here - and it&apos;s mostly women. Her mother worked here as did her sister, and alongside her fellow shop-steward, Gaynor, she earns the minimum wage, \u00a35.35 an hour. They&apos;re not the most likely global activists, and the factory&apos;s security hut, where we&apos;re sitting, is an equally unlikely campaign headquarters. It&apos;s the size of a cupboard. Lucy Barnes, a 21-year-old, turns up holding a photocopy of the letters she sent to Glyn from Big Brother, the first celebrity they approached. &apos;My friend Teresa knew he lived in Blaenau, so we just addressed it to Glyn, Blaenau, and fair play, it got to him and he wrote back.&apos; According to Mervyn Burnett, local organiser of the union GMB, Britain&apos;s General Union, they sent letters to &apos;anyone and everyone we could think of&apos; and started to receive a steady trickle of messages of support. It was when they got actor Ioan Gruffudd that everything changed. A local boy from Aberdare, he was, at the time, the face of Burberry. Once he lent his support, other celebrities followed. &apos;It&apos;s a small place, Wales. We all used our contacts,&apos; continues Burnett. Leighton Andrews, the Welsh Assembly member for the Rhondda, and local MP Chris Bryant, organised a dial-a-celeb ringathon. &apos;Jill Evans, an MEP, got Bryn Terfel,&apos; says Burnett. &apos;Glenys Kinnock happened to know Emma Thompson. A local TV presenter knew Irvine Welsh, I had Tom Jones&apos;s agent&apos;s details. A colleague bumped into Charlotte Church in a cafe in Cardiff. They&apos;ve all given us messages of support or written in person to the company.&apos; It is a small place, Wales. To get a quote from Glenys Kinnock, I just pop down the road from my mum and dad&apos;s house and knock on her door (although she&apos;s not in). It&apos;s all so interconnected here, but nowhere more so than the Rhondda, which Gaynor describes as &apos;one family, basically&apos;. In the Rhondda Fawr there&apos;s only one road - &apos;The Long Street&apos;, they used to call it, along which everybody still lives. The publicity the closure has generated has been out of all proportion to its size. There&apos;s been headline after headline. Janet Street- Porter weighed into the debate saying she thought Burberry had been villified for making a tough economic decision. They haven&apos;t though. In February, Burberry pulled out of its sponsorship of the Bafta party. In a cafe opposite the Park &amp; Dare working- men&apos;s institute in Treorchy, a towering edifice devoted to helping fulfil the potential of Rhondda&apos;s workers of the early 20th century, Welsh Assembly member Leighton Andrews gives me a rundown of how that happened 21st-century style. Nobody even knew about Burberry and the Bafta party until Leighton stumbled upon it in a random websearch. &apos;Once we found out, we got the Welsh chairman of Bafta to say he wouldn&apos;t be attending, and then Dame Judi Dench said she wouldn&apos;t, and she was a nominee, and Michael Sheen. And then they cancelled it. To save &quot;embarrassment&quot;, they said.&apos; What the workers in Treorchy have done, in alliance with GMB and the skills that Leighton Andrews brought from his time running public affairs for the BBC, is a whole new methodology for conducting an industrial dispute. Professor Tom Sorell, who holds the John Ferguson chair of global ethics at the University of Birmingham, says that there have been plenty of instances of international solidarity between trade unions before, &apos;but it&apos;s the first time that I&apos;ve heard of workers doing it this way, of utilising new technology to appeal over the heads of the company, to TV audiences in other countries&apos;. There&apos;s also a blog, the keepburberrybritish domain name they registered, the Google alerts. It may even have worked. In the end Burberry improved its redundancy pay-outs, gave the factory and its machinery to the community, promised to take orders from any viable concern that takes its place, and to put \u00a31.5m into a community trust fund. And then there&apos;s Mohammed Al Fayed. The GMB had contacts with him via Fulham football club; &apos;Pal Fayed&apos;, the local paper, the Rhondda Leader, called him on their front page. So, not depressing, then, on some levels. Even after talking to David Rees, who, at 62, has worked in the factory for 47 years. His wife worked here for 22 years (they met on the factory floor), and his daughter for six years, and he finds the thought of its closure &apos;heartbreaking - I&apos;m tearing up, just thinking about it&apos;. But if nothing else, the campaign has been a tribute to the level of human skill that&apos;s on offer in the Rhondda Valley, its people - the only raw material left. &apos;They underestimated us,&apos; says Gaynor. &apos;They forgot about our history. We weren&apos;t going to go without a fight.&apos; On a different occasion, for a different article, I could easily be interviewing Stacey Cartwright, Burberry&apos;s chief financial officer, for her thoughts on high-flying British businesswomen and asking questions about who designed her trouser suit. She&apos;s the glamorous, dynamic face of the British transglobal economy. But this is not that occasion, and in the beige-on-beige meeting room at Burberry&apos;s HQ in London, with David Yelland, the ex-editor of the Sun, and her PR minder in tow, it&apos;s not quite so chummy. Were you taken aback by the level of publicity the case has aroused, I ask. &apos;Well, it&apos;s just slightly perverse really that you could have quite that degree of coverage for a polo-shirt factory,&apos; she says. &apos;All we were doing was consolidating manufacture into other locations because, regrettably, it costs twice as much to produce a polo-shirt in Wales as it does anywhere else.&apos; But you must have been surprised, I say. &apos;But again, some of the coverage seemed as equally bemused as we were as to why they were writing about it.&apos; It&apos;s an odd but maybe telling choice of words: the coverage is &apos;perverse&apos;; the company is &apos;bemused&apos;; they&apos;re &apos;only&apos; polo-shirts. They are only polo-shirts, but then that doesn&apos;t stop Burberry charging \u00a360 a pop for them. And it&apos;s this that goes to the nub of what&apos;s made the Treorchy closure a uniquely special case. The shirts they make cost \u00a360 because of the power of the Burberry brand, self-described as &apos;a luxury brand with a distinctive British sensibility&apos;. The company sells not just clothes but Britishness, very effectively, to what is largely an overseas market. And, what&apos;s more, they turn a profit. A handsome one - \u00a384m last year, up seven per cent from the year before. &apos;If we were losing money, well, then you have to accept it,&apos; says Joan Young. &apos;And we&apos;ve come close to the brink a lot of times over the years, but we&apos;re not losing money. We&apos;re making money for the company. It&apos;s greed is all it is.&apos; According to Mervyn Burnett, the GMB has calculated that the factory makes the company \u00a322m a year. It costs \u00a311 to produce a polo-shirt in Treorchy and the factory makes 600,000 of them a year. &apos;Working it out on an average retail price of \u00a355 and then taking off what we calculate is the running costs of keeping the factory open, \u00a31.2m, still leaves you with \u00a322m.&apos; Burberry puts the same calculation another way. If they made the same number of polo-shirts in China for \u00a34 apiece, they would make \u00a32m extra profit. Ergo, they are losing \u00a32m a year by keeping it open. Moving jobs to China is &apos;sad but inevitable&apos;, says Stacey Cartwright. Chinese shirts are &apos;higher quality&apos; and the company has a duty under law to maximise its profits for its shareholders. &apos;It was absolutely the right decision to make. We don&apos;t regret it for a moment.&apos; Lots of people agree with her, of course. The Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal. The most credible voice against this strategy is, strangely, Burberry&apos;s own. There, on the website, once you get past the shiny photos of Kate Moss, is a whole section on corporate social responsibility. &apos;[This] involves considering those social, environmental and ethical issues that if managed improperly could pose a threat to the Group&apos;s assets, reputation and the Burberry brand.&apos; Furthermore, one of the five areas of interest is: &apos;Community affairs - developing strong relationships in our chosen communities in support of our business objectives, by using the Group&apos;s unique assets to benefit society.&apos; It&apos;s not a &apos;chosen community&apos; though, the Rhondda, simply one in what&apos;s begun to look like terminal decline. It receives EU Objective 1 funding, given to areas that earn less than 75 per cent of the EU&apos;s average GDP, putting it on a par with areas in Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Poland. Fifty-five percent of the population live in a household where at least one member can&apos;t work due to ill-health, and given that Stacey Cartwright pointed out that &apos;there are jobs, it just might mean travelling out of the valley for them&apos;, it&apos;s worth noting that 37 per cent of households don&apos;t have a car. In Carpanini&apos;s, a wonderful old-fashioned Italian cafe of the type that peppers the valleys, I stumble across a nest of Plaid Cymru activists. &apos;The opening of the factory transformed the life of women in this valley,&apos; Geraint Davies tells me. &apos;Before then, they had to leave and go into service. There were 1,500 there in its heydays and a stream of buses. The thing is we&apos;re losing population here. We&apos;re down 12 per cent in Treherbert from 1991 to 2001 and at Burberry&apos;s it was mostly women&apos;s jobs. If we keep the women we keep the families. If the man has to travel out of the valley for work, but his wife still has a job locally, then they stay. But if they&apos;re both travelling, there&apos;s no sense in it.&apos; Geraint&apos;s father, local councillor Cennard Davies tells me, was the man who founded the Treorchy male voice choir. When I&apos;m up there later I remember that this choir is the most famous of all the male voice choirs. It&apos;s a product of Treorchy, and like Burberry&apos;s clothes, its music has been exported all over the world - they&apos;ve been to Australia four times, the States, all over Europe. Everyone in that room knows someone who works at Burberry&apos;s, or Polikoff&apos;s as it&apos;s still known - the name it opened with nearly 70 years ago. Norman Martin, an ex-miner who became a teacher, tells me how the choir president was MD of the factory at one time. How they&apos;d made their first uniforms. &apos;And when they won the Queen&apos;s Award for Industry, it was us who went up there and sang for all the dignitaries. What does that mean now? They&apos;ve no idea about the community at all.&apos; It&apos;s still an extraordinary place, the Rhondda, by anybody&apos;s measure. The valley is a narrow, high-sided funnel with a road that Leighton Andrews points out is the same one that&apos;s been there, not much improved, since 1850. Driving up over the hill into the Rhondda Fach, the road is so steep that even in second gear my car&apos;s engine strains. It&apos;s what made the Rhondda the most famous of all the South Wales valleys - its unique topography; that combined with the sheer concentration of its coal mines, 52 at one point, and the explosive exponential growth that saw the population leap from 2,000 to 150,000 almost overnight. It&apos;s yesterday&apos;s China. And the impact of its overnight industrialisation still impacts the population today. On my last day, I find myself wondering what exactly a &apos;distinctive British sensibility&apos; is anyway. When I Google the phrase I get Burberry&apos;s website, so I try &apos;British values&apos; and the first entry is Tony Blair declaiming the &apos;core British values of fair play, creativity, tolerance and an outward-looking approach to the world&apos;. Fair play, or chwarae teg, as they call it here. I ask Birmingham University&apos;s Tom Sorell what he thinks: &apos;It&apos;s always a question of reducing the costs but when it normally happens in British industry, such as with Jaguar or Aston Martin, there&apos;s been no choice. It&apos;s survival. I think in Burberry&apos;s case it&apos;s not a survive-or-die sort of case. It&apos;s an icing-on-the-cake sort of case.&apos; So they deserve the barracking they&apos;re getting? &apos;I think so. If there&apos;s no direct threat to profitability, we should be asking: is it ethical or at least questionable?&apos; Is it ethical? On the way out of Burberry HQ, David Yelland escorts me to the door and tells me that the real victim of the story is Wales. &apos;Who&apos;s going to invest there now? They&apos;ll look at the headlines and go to Ireland instead. I can tell you now that I know of more than one company that has already made that decision.&apos; This sounds to me like something the Chinese government would say. Thinking about it, they probably already have - to the location-scouting executives from Burberry. The fact that it&apos;s illegal to form a union in China keeps wages down, and the low cost of labour is one of the country&apos;s major selling points. Mark Ritson, a columnist for Marketing magazine and the associate professor of marketing at Melbourne Business School, tells me something even more depressing. &apos;Having worked for some of the world&apos;s leading luxury brands I have to tell you that they depend on what they call &apos;notoriety&apos;. Most luxury houses are more than a century old and there is a danger of becoming old and dusty. Most savvy luxury managers are well aware of this which is why, quite deliberately, they regularly try to inject a bit of scandal and vivacity into the brand. &apos;The current spat is a small but welcome boon. It&apos;s certainly not something that Angela Ahrendts and her team are worried about.&apos; I rather hope that Joan Young and David Rees and Gaynor Richards aren&apos;t reading this. I hope, too, that no company could be as cynical to see the death of manufacturing in the Rhondda Valley and the dissolution of a community as a matter of &apos;scandal and vivacity&apos;. But then, any company that can happily mark up its polo-shirts by \u00a349 and then remark that they&apos;re &apos;only&apos; polo-shirts, is hardly above suspicion. It&apos;s finally over now. The workers intend to march out of the factory accompanied by a brass band and the Treorchy male voice choir on the last day. You go down fighting in these parts. And hoping Pal Fayed may yet come through."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/mar/26/conservationandendangeredspecies.travelnews", "publicationDate": "2007-03-25T23:00:57Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Conservation", "Travel", "World news", "Wildlife", "Animals", "Insects", "Butterflies"], "sentences": ["In the history of road transport, there can rarely have been such a poetic excuse for a traffic jam: Taiwan will close a busy motorway section this week to allow butterflies to flutter by.", "The closure of a 600-metre section of the elevated expressway reflects a growing ecological consciousness in Taiwan, which is famous for the diversity of its lepidopteran species.", "Taiwan is home to about 400 species of butterfly, 40 of which are unique to the island."], "title": "Motorway shut to let butterflies swarm past", "article": "In the history of road transport, there can rarely have been such a poetic excuse for a traffic jam: Taiwan will close a busy motorway section this week to allow butterflies to flutter by. Drivers on the Linnei section of Freeway No. 3 have been warned to expect delays as up to 1m purple-spotted butterflies per day flit along the road during their annual migration. The closure of a 600-metre section of the elevated expressway reflects a growing ecological consciousness in Taiwan, which is famous for the diversity of its lepidopteran species. The insects - also known as Euploeini or milkweed butterflies - fly north each spring to breed. During their brief migratory peak, more than 11,000 pass the road every minute, creating a blizzard of wings. No car accidents have been reported, but conservationists say countless thousands of insects are splattered on windscreens, crushed under wheels or sucked into a vehicle&apos;s slipstream. As well as temporarily closing a lane for the first time, the local authorities have also erected a net along the motorway aimed at forcing the butterflies to fly higher above the traffic. Local media said ultraviolet lights would also be placed under the road to guide the light-sensitive insects to fly safely underneath. The measures, which will cost about \u00a320,000 to put in place, were suggested by Lin Tie-shyong, associate professor at I-shou University&apos;s department of civil and ecological engineering. Prof Lin told local reporters he was surprised that officials had followed his recommendations. The National Freeway Bureau said the plan was worth doing even if it led to traffic jams.

There was that appalling performance against Israel, and before that Macedonia, Croatia, Northern Ireland, oh God, this sentence could go on for ever, I&apos;ve got 40 years of hurt to torture myself with, so let&apos;s just list and evaluate all the different reasons and explanations and observations which have been made so far to explain what&apos;s gone wrong with England. 1.  Our leading clubs being banned from Europe, that really cut off and handicapped our England stars when they played against European countries. Do you remember that theory, back in the 1980s? It seemed to explain England doing badly. Total rubbish, then and now. This season, our clubs are the most successful in Europe - and still the national team is crap. 2.  We have a golden generation of English players, best for some time, like Rooney, Ferdinand, Gerrard and Lampard, stars of our top clubs who are now playing brilliantly, conquering Europe, delighting the world, as of course the Premiership is the best league anywhere, blah, blah, so surely the England team, blessed with such talent, should be doing well? The flaw in this argument is that it&apos;s the foreigners in our top clubs who are doing so well. Chelsea would be lost without Drogba, United without Ronaldo, Arsenal without Henry. 3.  Actually, English players are poor at this moment in time, which makes it tough when anyone supposedly good gets injured. That&apos;s more like it. Phil Neville is a Man Utd reject. Andy Johnson and Peter Crouch are strictly Championship. Defoe can&apos;t make the Spurs first XI. John Terry is a lump. Ferdinand sleepwalks. Lampard and Gerrard are too dumb to work out for themselves how to play together. Robbo&apos;s a dodgy keeper. 4.  In fact, all our top teams are much better than England. Most fans would agree that Man Utd, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal earlier in the season could stuff the England team, any time. Thanks of course to all the foreign players. And yet, and yet, Italy managed to win the World Cup despite their league having so many South American and other foreign imports. It can be done. 5.  Players play better with their clubs because they are more settled, train and live together, know each other&apos;s play. When they turn up and play for England, they are strangers. Didn&apos;t handicap them in 1966, did it? 6.  Rooney appears so unhappy playing for England, compared with playing for Man Utd. Come on. Wouldn&apos;t you prefer to see Ronaldo and Giggs out on the wings, about to give you an ace ball, compared with Lennon crossing it into the stands or Downing running in the wrong direction? Or having Scholes behind you, laying on a proper pass? 7.  We&apos;ve got a useless manager, &quot;Mad Mac&quot; as the Daily Mirror called him last week or &quot;Half Baked McDonut&quot;, according to the Sun. It does explain a lot. If he&apos;d been half decent, a Premiership club would have hired him, not boring old Boro. But who would you prefer? Bring back Terry Venables or Kevin Keegan? Or Sven, as he still hasn&apos;t got a job. Or Stuart Pearce, who was being tipped last time. No, we&apos;re now lumbered. 8.  England players are being bribed to play badly by a fiendish Asian betting syndicate. At last, a theory that would explain everything. But unlike cricketers, footballers are multimillionaires, so why would they want to do that? Ah, but rich people are greedy people, hence they&apos;ll sell out to Nike or anyone else willing to give them even more millions for doing very little. 9.  The only solution, suggested the football columnist of the New Statesman, is that the FA should follow the example of Man Utd, Chelsea, Liverpool, West Ham, etc, and sell out to foreign ownership. That way the 91 suits on every committee would get the push, a proper businessman would be in charge and England&apos;s results would improve. What a stupid idea. Who thought of that? The FA is a charity, so can&apos;t be sold. 10.  Bring back Becks. Even stupider, though hang on. We used to moan that all Becks could do is take free-kicks and corners, but now we don&apos;t have anyone as they&apos;re all useless. Perhaps he could return as a sub, only coming on for free-kicks? 11.  &quot;You don&apos;t know what you&apos;re doing.&quot; This was shouted at the England players after Israel (and Macedonia, Northern Ireland, oh not again) and our poor petals found it jolly hurtful, as did Mad Mac when it was yelled at him. But it&apos;s spot on, the only 100% accurate observation that has been made so far about England. None of them know . . . China and Taiwan fight for the high grounds of the Windies One of the many mysteries of the Cricket World Cup, apart from the murder and the points system (what does R/R mean?) is those amazing, wonderful stadiums in which the games are being played. They all seem to be brand new architectural wonders. How can such titchy countries with no money possibly have afforded to build them? South Africa, when it comes to the football World Cup, might make a right mess of things, but it&apos;s a big country with a big population, rich in minerals and resources. Those little West Indian islands did have bananas and sugar, but no one wants them now, and they&apos;ve never had wine growing. In fact all they&apos;ve got is tourism, which of course gets ruined every time there&apos;s a hurricane. So what&apos;s the explanation? I was in the West Indies in January, for our annual summer hols, visiting Antigua and Grenada, and was astounded by the magnificent cricket grounds which were then being completed. In Grenada, I managed to get inside the sparkling new ground, which seemed to dwarf the whole landscape. Grenada has a population the size of Carlisle, or Andorra, so who put up the money and built it? The answer, so I was told, was the Chinese. That didn&apos;t seem to make sense. China is thousands of miles away and they don&apos;t play cricket. Ah, but they like to keep in with little countries, even specks on the map, who might vote on their side when it comes to UN resolutions, especially on contentious subjects like Taiwan. The Taiwanese would seem to have the same idea. They put up most of the money for the new stadium in St Kitts. Who&apos;s the handsome dastard in the black? Thank God that&apos;s over, those England games, and we can get back to the Premiership. Life has been empty with no matches on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, here or in Europe. I&apos;ve been going to bed at nine. Nothing else to do. Now I can start looking out for that Spanish ref whose name I haven&apos;t yet caught. I can&apos;t take my eyes off him. He&apos;s the one with the swept-back, sleek black hair, heavily Brylcreemed. Looks like a 1930s gigolo. If Collina, the baldie Italian, could become a world star, this Spaniard could be our first galactico ref.

Expectations are heaped upon you: you&apos;re the embodiment of freshness and promise, the new and failsafe antidote to all that is familiar and predictable and creased at the edges. You&apos;re buoyed up by hype, bolstered by the love of strangers - and expected to repay that investment in full, with a constant supply of audience-pleasing invention and innovation. And then, just as you&apos;re getting used to the pressure and starting to find your voice, the bubble bursts. Imitators flood the market, and the very quirks that used to charm your fans seem weary and unoriginal. You&apos;re yesterday&apos;s news, and you barely even got going. Trendy film-producing nations have been growing up fast of late. In 1995, everyone wanted to make like the Danes and fill their films up with shaky cameras and raw emotions. Even Steven Spielberg expressed his desire to make a film according to the Dogme 95 Vow of Chastity, which sought - with tongue edging into cheek - to purify the process of film production via the removal of extraneous glitz. Within a few years, though, the very originators of the scheme had abandoned its key tenets, journalists were sick of talking about it, and Spielberg wasn&apos;t showing much sign of abandoning special effects or scripted dialogue. South America swooped in, with a crop of sexy, sweaty, socially conscious movies, but the rebellious swagger of those early films was imitated enough to become hackneyed. (&quot;So City of God,&quot; sighed hacks exiting festival screenings.) Enter South Korea, with daring, convention-busting auteurs such as Park Chan-Wook and Kim Ki-Duk; Japan, with a seemingly endless supply of punishing horror concepts; and Hong Kong and China, providing punchy thrillers and spectacular martial arts epics. Soon enough, East Asian horror remakes represented a highly lucrative Hollywood cottage industry; Martin Scorsese was transforming Infernal Affairs into his Oscar-winner The Departed; and China&apos;s latest young diva Zhang Ziyi was starring in a L&apos;Oreal campaign. You don&apos;t get to have the edge for long, yet English-speaking buyers, pundits and audiences continue to search for the next source of far-flung inspiration. The Sundance film festival was peppered this year with American film-makers channelling foreign influences: prize-winning films Manda Bala, Padre Nuestro and The Pool were US productions set in Brazil, Mexico and India respectively. Nor has remake fever abated, with the brothers Weinstein even planning an improbable English language version of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck&apos;s foreign language Oscar-winner The Lives of Others. Quite how this very German tale of 1980s secret service intrigue will translate remains to be seen; but the film&apos;s massive impact does crown a period of remarkable revival for the long-unfashionable German film industry. There&apos;s a particular German flair for solid, serious, handsomely crafted historical pieces, exemplified by Downfall, Sophie Scholl: The Final Days, The Lives of Others and the recent Berlin film festival hit The Counterfeiters; but more radical impulses are also flourishing. Hans Christian-Schmidt created enough of a sensation with last year&apos;s Requiem to ensure a buzz around his upcoming follow-up Storm. Christian Petzold continues a fascinating series of idiosyncratic, graceful psychological studies with his latest film, Yella, which won a best actress award in Berlin for its star Nina Hoss. If France has looked a little low on innovation in recent years, Germany is currently raising a host of interesting new directors, among them Fatih Akin, Birgit Grosskopf, Valeska Grisebach and Stefan Krohmer. The wider reaches of eastern Europe also seem fired with creativity, as newborn nations assess their own changing status and new generations come to terms with decades of upheaval. Romania, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia and the Czech Republic all have thriving film industries and the odd foreign hit, among them Bosnia&apos;s 2006 Golden Bear winner Grbavica. A Czech adaption of Robert Graves&apos; Beauty in Trouble has made a splash at festivals this year. Further afield, Turkey is perhaps the country to have most recently produced a bona fide festival demigod, the kind of name whose premieres automatically attract slavering crowds. Nuri Bilge Ceylan made his first film, The Small Town, in 1998, but it was the rapturous response to 2002&apos;s Distant that established him as an international star. His latest film, Climates, affirms his incomparable gift for portraying raw landscapes and rawer emotions. Another Turkish production, Reha Erdem&apos;s Times and Winds, was a poetic, gently witty masterpiece that easily outshone the bulk of festival product over last year. Perhaps it&apos;s African cinema, however, that really qualifies as the story of the moment. With Africa having become such a modish backdrop for big-budget English language thrillers - Shooting Dogs, The Constant Gardener, Blood Diamond, The Last King of Scotland, Catch a Fire - it seems only fair that wholly indigenous cinema should flourish concurrently. And there&apos;s a great deal to discover: we are talking, after all, about hundreds of filmmakers working in 1,000 languages across more than 50 countries. Nigeria&apos;s domestic industry alone produces around 1,000 films a year, and ranks as one of the world&apos;s most prolific film-producing nations. Those African films that have gained international audiences in recent years have met with unprecedented interest and acclaim. Established directors such as Dani Kouyat\u00e9, from Mali, Abderrahmane Sissako, from Mauritania, and the veteran Ousmane Sembene, from Senegal, are attracting new interest, as emerging names such as Burkina Faso&apos;s Fanta Regina Nacro and Mali&apos;s Salif Traor\u00e9 find festival acclaim with fresh titles. Securing regular international distribution is still a challenge, but the interest is strong enough that it&apos;s possible this child star can look forward to a degree of career longevity. The advent of digital distribution could broaden potential markets for foreign films that might never have won widespread audiences. Of course, the one constant of the film industry is unpredictability, so any sudden shift could transform the landscape. Who&apos;s to say the Netherlands won&apos;t assert itself in the wake of Paul Verhoeven&apos;s brilliant Black Book; or that Greece won&apos;t experience a sudden renaissance? South Korea isn&apos;t completely over yet - Park Chan-wook premiered a new and striking title, I&apos;m a Cyborg But That&apos;s OK, in Berlin. Argentina still has a few quiet stars: Lucrecia Martel, Lisandro Alonso, Daniel Burman. Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand have promising new names. In any case, while English-speaking viewers may be hunting far and wide for new product, it&apos;s interesting to note that there&apos;s rather less cultural traffic in the other direction. Hollywood may still dominate the global box office, but foreign territories have proved unusually loyal to local product over the past year, with the US ceding its stranglehold overseas to homegrown hits such as South Korea&apos;s The Host (which did double the business of Mission: Impossible III on its home turf), Russia&apos;s Day Watch, Germany&apos;s Grave Decisions and Mexico&apos;s Km 31.

There is so much rubbish to be recycled that parts of the village look like a dump. &quot;The river is foul - we can smell it from our classrooms,&quot; says Wang Yanxia, a student at a local middle school. &quot;When it rains, the water floods on to the path and the stench is everywhere.&quot; Villagers may not have heard of Tesco, but the British high street giant has an all too visible presence. One factory has even decorated its front gates with huge plastic banners advertising a Tesco mobile phone offer. If China is the end of the line for the plastic bag, it is also the beginning. Most of the carrier bags used in Britain are made in Chinese factories just a few hours&apos; drive from Mai. From there, they travel halfway around the world, are dished out to British shoppers - and then at least some of them find their way back. The 10,000-mile odyssey between manufacturing and dumping is the story of our age, part economic miracle, part environmental tragedy. In the space of just 20 years, the fishing village of Shenzhen, in the south of China close to Hong Kong, has become an industrial powerhouse with a population of more than eight million and a container port that handles more cargo than anywhere in the world other than Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. This is where most of the planet&apos;s toys and shoes are made, where Apple outsources much of the production of its iPods, where Wal-Mart fills its shelves. And, naturally, it is also the place that makes billions of the plastic bags that briefly contain all these consumer goods. Shenzhen Delux Arts Plastics is a typical manufacturer, paying its workers about \u00a360 a month to churn out 25,000 plastic carriers every day, a fifth of which go to Europe, some to Next in the UK. It is a simple, three-part process. Bags full of plastic pellets are fed into an induction pipe, melted together at a temperature of 180C and then stretched and wound on to rolls the width of the desired bag. Next, the rolls are fed through a series of cylinder printing presses, each adding a different colour, until the logo and lettering are complete. Finally, an army of workers on the second floor carries out the more labour-intensive process of melting handles on to the bags, checking quality and packing. From start to finish, it takes just five minutes to make a bag. The production cost for each bag is less than four pence, most of which goes on machinery maintenance, management and materials. The primary ingredient is polyfabric polypropylene or other types of plastic, all of them petroleum based and imported directly from Saudi Arabia or from refineries in Singapore and Japan. The industry has a significant carbon footprint. By one estimate, the US alone requires 12 million barrels of oil for the 100 billion bags its consumers use annually. For factory manager Andy Lue, the main concern is that the cost of plastic is rising along with the surge in oil prices. &quot;Our customers would complain if we tried to pass on the extra cost of the materials,&quot; he says. The factory&apos;s main competitive advantage is labour, which accounts for less than a 10th of the production costs of a plastic bag. Wages in Shenzhen are low, and more than three-quarters of the population are migrants, many of them living in huge company dormitories far from their homes and families, and working in dirty, dangerous conditions. Over at the Delux Arts Plastics factory, pay and working conditions are above average for Shenzhen. The manager will not permit us to talk to employees, but we are introduced to &quot;group leader&quot; Chen Ping, a migrant from Guangxi Province, who tells us that the situation has improved enormously since she started working and living in the factory 11 years ago. &quot;The managers realise they must let us eat and sleep better if they want us to work harder.&quot; Chen earns more than double the average factory salary, but her life is far from easy. Because she is a migrant, her two children will have to return to their home town to go to school, which means she will see them for only a few days each year, at spring festival. But she expresses no sense of grievance, even though the consumers who use her Next bags can easily pay more for a single shirt than she earns in a month. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is unfair. We make these bags to be used. They have their own value.&quot; In Britain, plastic bags have long been a cause of irritation, partly due to their visibility. In gutters and branches, the useless, ugly flutter of discarded, brightly coloured plastic taunts us with human fecklessness. They pose problems for wildlife, they block drains. And 17 billion plastic bags a year are handed out to British shoppers. What has made them, suddenly, a very hot issue is the launch of another kind of bag - an item that has already become the status bag of 2007. This is not the reissued Chanel quilt-and-chain classic, the 2.55. It is not even the YSL Downtown, with its modish zips and snap fastenings. And - here&apos;s the thing - it costs \u00a35. There is nothing inherently remarkable about Anya Hindmarch&apos;s I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag. It is a simple, rope-handled, sturdy cotton shopping bag, albeit one that&apos;s rather beautifully designed, as you would expect from the British Accessory Designer of the Year. What is significant, however, is the reaction to it at every stage, from the sketchbook to the checkout. There have already been queues at the Mayfair store Dover Street Market, when a few preview bags went on sale. At around the same time, the British Retail Consortium has announced a voluntary initiative to reduce the environmental impact of carrier bags by 25% by the end of next year, through the use of alternative materials to make lighter-weight bags, by encouraging reuse, offering and promoting &quot;bags for life&quot;, always asking customers whether they require a bag at all and providing bag recycling points. In other words: reduce, reuse, recycle. Friends of the Earth are quick to point out that, in the context of the scale of the environmental issues with which we are faced, plastic bags, which account for only 0.3% of the domestic waste stream, are not their top priority. Even so, the average person in the UK accepts, on average, five plastic bags a week. The decision as to whether to take a bag is almost a daily one. The supermarket checkout has become, therefore, a frontline of the battle for the environment, even more so because, unlike recycling or composting of domestic waste, it is a decision we take in public, and so reflects not only personal beliefs but what we see to be public norms. It is for this reason that Decline Plastic Bags Wherever Possible is the first action suggested in the book Change The World For A Fiver. &quot;Declining plastic bags is totemic of lots of things,&quot; says Eugenie Harvey, co-founder of the global social-change movement We Are What We Do, which produced the book. &quot;It&apos;s the most visible aspect of a whole set of behaviour around shopping: do you buy environmentally friendly washing powder; do you buy locally produced food?&quot; Trevor Datson, spokesman for Tesco, calls the &quot;Do you need a bag?&quot; moment at the checkout &quot;a constant conversation between us and the customer. I was in the Sandhurst store yesterday and my colleague on the checkout remarked to me how many more people remember to bring in their own bags these days.&quot; Hindmarch&apos;s bag may help. She has a knack for reading the zeitgeist, as illustrated by the phenomenal success of her Be A Bag range, whereby family photos could be made into smart handbags, a concept that in the six years since it was launched has been copied all over the world. The low price of the I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag - a fiver - was absolutely essential to the project, Hindmarch says. &quot;And so was the point of sale, which had to be the supermarket checkout.&quot; Hindmarch is, however, a businesswoman, and as such knew that too many \u00a35 Anya Hindmarch bags on the market would damage her upmarket brand. (To put the price in perspective, the Elrod, one of the key Anya Hindmarch leather handbag styles for this summer, sells for around \u00a3500.) Production therefore had to be limited, and so the bag had to be made in China if the figures were going to add up. &quot;That was not ideal, of course,&quot; Hindmarch concedes, &quot;but we have been careful about carbon-offsetting the project. Our aim was for the project to break even. None of the retailers involved in the project is making any money from it.&quot; A limited number of bags are currently on sale via Hindmarch&apos;s website, and from April 11, the remaining 20,000 bags will go on sale in Sainsbury&apos;s. The purpose of the Hindmarch bag is, says the designer, &quot;to cast a spotlight on the issue. Just to plant an idea in people&apos;s heads that will make them think before automatically reaching for a bag.&quot; Finding a complete solution to the plastic bag problem is extremely complicated. All the supermarkets profess commitment to the issue, but all have different policies. Tesco produces all-degradable bags and operates a clubcard scheme to reward people for reusing bags, on the principle that &quot;incentive is better than coercion, because if people do something resentfully, they are not making such a deep-seated change&quot;. Waitrose emphasises the &quot;bag for life&quot; scheme, which they were the first retailer to introduce 10 years ago. The Co-op&apos;s bags are degradable; Sainsbury&apos;s are made of one-third recycled material. The opening of the country&apos;s first organic supermarket, Whole Foods Market in Kensington, in June, may further accelerate the process of change - the store, like its Fresh &amp; Wild predecessors, will refund customers 5p for not taking a bag. Friends of the Earth, however, would like to see a government tax on all plastic bags. Degradable and biodegradable bags are &quot;not an environmentally friendly option&quot;, they say, and &quot;will lead to the public becoming increasingly confused as to what they are supposed to do with them. Degradable plastic bags usually can&apos;t be recycled with normal plastic bags, and people may think they can put degradable bags into their compost bins, which they can&apos;t.&quot; Degradable bags are still made from plastic, so placing demands on oil resources. They contain a metal additive to make them degrade and tend to require sunlight to break down. If biodegradable bags end up in landfill, they will eventually produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Paper bags are no better, say Friends of the Earth, because they have less capacity for being reused, and require more energy and resources in manufacture and transport than plastic alternatives. Bags made from recycled plastics, which are then reused or recycled, are considered by many a better option, but recycling points for bags are as yet not widely accessible. In any case, all too often, a promise by municipal government to recycle simply means sending the rubbish to China. In trade terms, it makes an odd kind of sense. Historically, British merchants have always found it easy to fill their ships with goods on the route from China, but all too often they have been stuck with empty cargo holds in the opposite direction. This trade gap is the main reason why English gunboats forced opium on China in the 19th century. Today, however, the answer is not drugs, but garbage. China exports almost \u00a312.6 billion-worth of manufactured goods and other products to the UK each year. In return, the UK sends back 1.9 million tonnes of rubbish, for the simple reason that it&apos;s cheaper than dumping it at a UK landfill site. Because the ships are almost empty on their way back to China, the cargo costs are tiny - it&apos;s cheaper to send a container of waste from London to Shenzhen than it is to truck it to Manchester. Under EU law, waste cannot be dumped abroad, but shipments for recycling are permitted. This means business for Guangdong Province, which is scattered with Steptoe and Son communities. There are the e-waste centres of Guiyu and Qingyuan, where families make a living from chopping up and melting down toxic plastics and metals from discarded computers, printers and mobile phones. Below them on the waste chain are the recyclers of plastic bags and bottles in Shunde and Heshan. Until recently, the most notorious of these was in Nanhai, a town just outside Guangzhou, where the streets were once piled high with rubbish and the streams thick with trash and pollution. Last month, however, after a series of embarrassing reports in the British media, the government was shamed into shutting down the entire area and banning imports of foreign garbage. Today, the streets of Nanhai are swept clean and the small recycling sheds are shuttered up. For many locals, however, this sudden concern about the environment is a financial disaster. &quot;We were ordered to close last month because some foreign rubbish contained toxins,&quot; says Ding Chunming, who used to process bottles and bags. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible blow because we only started this business last year. We get no compensation. All we can do is wait and hope the government allows us to restart business.&quot; But the industry has learned how to bypass laws and regulations. Many Nanhai refugees simply moved their scrapheaps to a new location. Two hours&apos; drive away, we found a new recycling centre under construction in Shijing village. The concrete is still wet on the floor and many of the sheds are only half complete, but the task of buying, selling and sorting rubbish is already in full flow. The operation is remarkably specialised. There are sections just for discarded hotel welcome mats, the bases of revolving chairs, black buckets and the lids of shampoo bottles. A local businesswoman, who gave her name only as Ms Liang, was terrified that another critical news report would force her to relocate again. &quot;We have only just got here from Nanhai,&quot; she says. &quot;I have never dealt with foreign waste. I can&apos;t do it now and I won&apos;t do it in the future.&quot; But for others the trade in foreign waste is too lucrative to disappear quickly. We were approached by a scrap dealer who asked if we had any rubbish to sell. He was after PVC, but he put us in touch with a factory in Shenzhen that said it could deal with carrier bags despite the ban. &quot;It can be done as long as the plastic is well enough packaged to get through customs,&quot; says the owner. &quot;You should ship them to Hong Kong and we will deal with them from there. If the bags are sorted by colour, we can pay you as much as $100 a tonne.&quot; Farther away from the media spotlight and the scrutiny of environment officials, many factories are still reprocessing British carrier bags and other rubbish despite the government&apos;s ban. Another hour&apos;s drive away is Shunde, where European trash is baled up on the roadside. Much of it is from the UK - Tesco milk cartons, Walkers crisp packets, Snickers wrappers and empty packets of Bisto gravy and Persil powder - but there are also bales containing the packaging for Dutch confectionery and Italian nappies. The village of Mai is close by. Running through the community is a street of recycling firms, outside each of which stands a blackboard detailing the type, colour and quality of the plastic they deal in. Some are no bigger than a shed in which migrant workers sift by hand through hundreds of thousands of tiny plastic pellets, picking out discoloured flecks and bits of fluff. Mai Weibo buys semi-processed bags for 9,000 yuan a tonne (around \u00a3600) and, after painstakingly cleaning up the contents, sells the plastic on for 10,500 yuan - &quot;We don&apos;t make much of a profit.&quot; The recycled plastic is not of sufficiently high quality to be used a second time for UK bags, so instead much of it is turned into red, white and blue plastic sheets, which are used for building site coverings and holdalls. Many locals believe the pollution is ruining their health. A local doctor says the village suffers from an unusually high incidence of respiratory diseases. &quot;Perhaps it was the pollution or perhaps it was because everyone smokes cigarettes,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a sensitive topic. Of course we want a garden-like environment, but people here have to make a living.&quot; Others say they have other priorities. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the environment,&quot; says one migrant labourer. &quot;I only want to make money. If your stomach isn&apos;t full, how can you worry about health?&quot; Everyone condemns as an eyesore the ditches full of carrier bags, but nobody seems to take responsibility for clearing up the mess. In fact, the main concern of local businessmen and government officials is to avoid scrutiny. &quot;The government has banned imported waste because of the media attention,&quot; says one local factory manager, whose warehouse includes giant baskets full of rubbish from the UK. &quot;The Nanhai recycling business has been shut down. This area doesn&apos;t want to suffer the same fate because it would hurt the government&apos;s income.&quot; Britain&apos;s stance is also equivocal: dumping waste overseas is forbidden, but sending it to another country for recycling is acceptable. When told of the foul conditions at Mai, an official at the UK consulate in Guangzhou says that individual companies have to take action. &quot;It is the responsibility of producers to make sure that waste is dealt with properly at all stages of the chain.&quot; Foreign governments have started to take action specifically on plastic carriers, some going much further than Britain&apos;s retailers and their aim for a voluntary 25% reduction in bag use by 2008. Ireland, for example, introduced a 15p &quot;plastax&quot; on carrier bags way back in 2002, which has subsequently led to a 90% reduction in use. Australia has launched a &quot;Say No To Carrier Bags&quot; campaign. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the government has obliged supermarkets to charge for bags at least two days a week. Italy is promoting the use of biodegradable bags. In France, reusable plastic bags - which are heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - now account for more than half of the \u00a4770m market. Inevitably, however, even those eco-bags are made in Shenzhen. The main producer is the Richall Group, which must be one of the world&apos;s fastest-growing companies. Launched in 2003 with starting capital of just \u00a31,000, last year it recorded sales of more than \u00a33m, and this year that figure is expected to triple, thanks to business from Sainsbury&apos;s, Unilever, Disney, Budweiser and Nestl\u00e9, all of whom are looking towards reusable bags. Richall&apos;s president, Liu Tianyan, says attitudes are changing but, more importantly, so are materials. &quot;We&apos;re never going to get rid of plastic bags completely, because in some cases, such as food wrappings, there is no good substitute. But in the case of shopping bags, I believe the flimsy plastic can be completely replaced.&quot; Not everyone thinks that would be a good thing. Peter Woodall, communications manager for the Carrier Bag Consortium, says, &quot;It&apos;s important to forget the emotion and look at the science. We are not filling our landfill with plastic bags. That is simply a myth. When real science is taken into account, the best environmental choice is plastic. Life-cycle analysis shows that if you use a conventional bag four times and then recycle it, that is better than using a &apos;bag for life&apos;.&quot; Environmental campaigners, meanwhile, believe the only solution is to make rich countries deal with their waste locally. &quot;That&apos;s the only way to make the whole community feel the impact,&quot; says Kevin May at Greenpeace&apos;s office in Beijing. &quot;If you can easily dump waste overseas, then there is no motive for having a waste-reduction programme at home. The argument that developing nations need recycled resources from wealthy nations is only partly true. The environmental costs are too high. Just look at the filthy water and polluted air of China. If we can stop the waste trade, I am sure it will lead to more sustainable development around the world.&quot; The apparent intractability of the plastic bag problem is all the more remarkable considering that our dependency on them is a recent phenomenon. Polythene was not even invented until the 30s, and plastic bags did not become common in supermarkets until the 70s. The idea that we can&apos;t live without them is a very modern one."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/31/society.politics", "publicationDate": "2007-03-31T22:57:00Z", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Society", "Politics", "Hari Kunzru"], "sentences": ["&quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Taiwan&quot;, &quot;Falun Gong&quot; and various terms leading to material critical of the Communist party were routinely unavailable."], "title": "Host not found", "article": "&quot;Sometimes the &apos;Don&apos;t be evil&apos; policy leads to many discussions about what exactly is evil. One thing we know is that people can make better decisions with better information. Google is a useful tool in people&apos;s lives. There are extreme cases, we&apos;re told, when Google has saved people&apos;s lives.&quot; Sergey Brin, Google founder, interviewed in Playboy, September 2004 As the internet enters its second decade as a mass medium, it&apos;s worth looking back at one of the old saws that was bandied around in the covered-wagon days, when Californian sages made gnomic pronouncements about the future and the rest of the world repeated them at dinner parties. &quot;The net treats censorship as damage and routes around it.&quot; These are the words of John Gilmore, radical libertarian, Sun Microsystems employee number five and bona fide west-coast guru-gazillionaire, and for much of the last 10 years they&apos;ve been repeated as part of the founding story of the internet, along with a gloss about the net&apos;s inception as a military communications network designed to withstand partial destruction by nuclear attack. In a technical sense, Gilmore (who was talking to a Time magazine journalist in 1993) has been proved right. The internet has provided an efficient conduit for people to share all manner of information other people don&apos;t want them to, whether those people are government whistle-blowers, child pornographers, political dissidents, intellectual property pirates or terrorists. From the Drudge Report to beheading videos, censorship is being successfully circumvented around the globe. Looked on from the neutral standpoint adopted by network engineers, this is proof of a robust system. Ethical or political judgements about the content of the information flowing through the networks aren&apos;t relevant. It&apos;s all data. We should celebrate. However, around the world, people have also discovered that, despite the abstractions of network architecture and the nostrums of boosters who predicted a &quot;new economy&quot; free of material constraints, the internet is also a physical thing, which has its existence on real telephone lines, internet service provider (ISP) routers, undersea fibre-optic lines and hard drives humming under tangible desks. And it&apos;s used by people sitting in real offices with real doors that can be broken down by all-too-real police if the information they&apos;re sharing contravenes local laws - and in some cases even if they don&apos;t, but some foreign power strong-arms their government, as happened in Sweden in May 2006, when US diplomats incited a police raid on an ISP hosting a popular file-sharing service called the Pirate Bay. The internet&apos;s ability to route round censorship has the character of an ideal rather than a reality, a theoretical property. No one understands this better than the Chinese journalist Shi Tao, who in April 2005 received a 10-year prison sentence for &quot;divulging state secrets abroad&quot;. A translation of court proceedings showed that Yahoo! Holdings (Hong Kong), a subsidiary of the American search corporation, had given information to Chinese state investigators allowing them to link him to re-postings on foreign-based websites of an internal message the authorities sent to his newspaper regarding coverage of the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Yahoo!, Google and other internet giants have argued that cooperation with state censorship is the price of doing business in China. With the hypertrophy of the Chinese economy, the financial temptations have proved too great, even for a generation of dotcom companies built on the barefoot idealism of their young staff. Google&apos;s oft-quoted motto is &quot;Don&apos;t be evil&quot;, which might have sounded cool in a Stanford coffee bar, but has lately become something of an international sick joke. The Chinese government runs one of the most determined and best- resourced censorship operations in the world. In recent years, prison sentences have been handed down for activities such as downloading material from Falun Gong websites or &quot;endangering state security&quot; by participating in pro-democracy discussion forums. This censorship effort relies partly on a large number of human monitors, and partly on technological means, often built and configured by suppliers outside China. For example, Skype, the internet telephone company recently bought by eBay, has admitted incorporating censorship functions into its Chinese-language service. Search technology (the current darling of the stock market) plays a major role in this. A research project by three universities, known as the OpenNet initiative, routed search requests through Chinese computers using Google, Yahoo! and popular Chinese search engines such as Baidu. They found that searches on many &quot;sensitive&quot; words were summarily cut off. &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;Taiwan&quot;, &quot;Falun Gong&quot; and various terms leading to material critical of the Communist party were routinely unavailable. Whether in China or Chicago, we&apos;re now living in a world where access to information is partly controlled by private corporations, whose wish to &quot;comply with local regulation&quot; may involve many layers of hidden decision-making about what we can see, read and hear. Lack of transparency in the process by which search results are produced means that we don&apos;t tend to see messages saying &quot;You have been banned by the government from visiting this site&quot;, or &quot;Someone will sue us if we let you see this.&quot; Instead we get &quot;host not found&quot; or no error message at all, just a timed-out connection or a crash we might attribute to some other cause. This is invisible censorship, hard to detect, hard to prove. In Uzbekistan, the government uses a technique called DNS hijacking to divert users from banned sites to so-called &quot;modified mirrors&quot;, fake versions similar to the originals in most respects, but containing misinformation or black propaganda. Without some technical knowledge, the substitution is hard to spot. Dissidents such as Shi Tao now face a matrix of government, technology and corporate power which represents a fundamental change in the way censorship is practised and experienced around the world. Beyond vague notions of &quot;corporate social responsibility&quot; it is clear that global information companies do not feel they have any obligation to be open or transparent, let alone to maintain any kind of public space for debate or dissent. Indeed, in a world where foundational technologies such as search algorithms are valuable intellectual property in themselves and messages travel through chains of privately owned systems operating under different national laws and local technical protocols, it can be almost impossible to know whether information is being buried or blocked, let alone what, how and by whom. Even in markets with no overt state censorship, the threat of legal action may be enough to take controversial information offline, a tactic frequently employed by corporations against critics or whistle-blowers. Payments are routinely made and taken for positioning in search rankings: money buys visibility, not accuracy or fairness. We appear to be moving towards a world with a privatised knowledge infrastructure, where indexing, storage and transmission are all performed by unaccountable entities engaged in what Human Rights Watch has aptly termed a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; for access to eyeballs and renminbi. What price market share in a world dancing to a Chinese economic tune? Whose organs get harvested? Whose liver will your board of directors eat? Nostalgia for disinterested notions of truth or intellectual independence will not suffice to preserve freedom of speech through the coming century. It will take concerted political action and a revitalisation of the notion of an &quot;unowned&quot; public sphere, something which will be fought tooth and nail by both state and corporate interests. We are already living through a period of enclosures, in which the knowledge commons are being rapidly fenced off. Social panic about terrorism and paedophilia means that there is strong public support in most western democracies for mandatory state access to private communications. In the permanent state of pseudo-war under which we now live, interior ministers constantly remind us that civil liberties must be balanced against the exigencies of security. Technologies such as strong encryption and anonymous remailing must, they tell us, be kept out of the hands of the public. Employment of such technologies must constitute reasonable cause for surveillance. Encryption keys must be handed over on demand. Local ISPs must be forced to surrender data when required, preferably through real-time automated &quot;black box&quot; monitors, connected to their systems. Monitoring of voice and data traffic by the US (and perhaps, one day, by China) must be facilitated. The list goes on. Unfortunately for us complacent beneficiaries of liberal democracy there is a paradox at work here. The technologies that provide anonymity to the paedophile and the terrorist also protect the political dissident and the whistle-blower. The encryption that impedes government surveillance of its citizens is also vital to the global banking system - an interesting area where corporate and state interests are in direct opposition. For human rights campaigners it is time to move beyond the sphere of protest and lobbying into an active engagement with information technologies, putting anti-censorship tools into the hands of those who need them, providing services and support to dissidents rather than campaigning for their release after they have been imprisoned. Preservation of the global public sphere, individual civil liberties at home and the safety of dissidents in totalitarian regimes are now inextricably linked. It&apos;s not an easy knot to untangle, but we must try. \u00b7 Extracted from Another Sky: Writings from Prison around the World in association with English PEN.

It is snagged on a twig above a Chinese stream that is choked with rubbish from around the world. Argos and Wal-Mart logos are visible in the fetid water and along banks strewn with plastic bags. Here in Mai, a village in Guangdong province, southern China, a community of recyclers ekes out a living from items considered so worthless in the West that they are given away and quickly discarded. Carrier bags and bottles are shipped here from London, Rotterdam, Hong Kong and other Chinese cities for chopping, melting and remoulding into pellets. Like many jobs outsourced to China, it is dirty, smelly, labour-intensive and poorly paid. There is so much rubbish to be recycled that parts of the village look like a dump. &quot;The river is foul - we can smell it from our classrooms,&quot; says a student. &quot;When it rains, the water floods on to the path and the stench is everywhere.&quot; If China is the end of the line for the plastic bag, it is also the beginning. Most of the carrier bags used in Britain are made in factories a few hours&apos; drive from Mai. From there they travel halfway around the world, are dished out to British shoppers - and then at least some of them find their way back. The 16,000km odyssey between manufacturing and dumping is the story of our age, part economic miracle, part environmental tragedy. In 20 years the fishing village of Shenzhen, in the south of China close to Hong Kong, has become an industrial powerhouse with a population of more than 8 million and a container port that handles more cargo than anywhere in the world other than Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai. This is where most of the world&apos;s toys and shoes are made, where Apple outsources much of the production of its iPods, where Wal-Mart fills its shelves. It is also the place that makes billions of the plastic bags that briefly contain all these consumer goods. Shenzhen Delux Arts Plastics is a typical manufacturer, paying its workers about $120 a month to churn out 25,000 plastic carriers every day, a fifth of which go to Europe. Bags full of plastic pellets are fed into an induction pipe, melted together at a temperature of 180C and then stretched and wound on to rolls the width of the desired bag. The rolls are fed through a series of cylinder printing presses, each adding a different colour, until the logo and lettering are complete. Finally an army of workers carries out the more labour-intensive process of melting handles on to the bags, checking quality and packing. From start to finish the process takes five minutes. The production cost for each bag is less than eight cents, most of which goes on machinery maintenance, management and materials. The primary ingredient is polyfabric polypropylene or other types of plastic, all of them petroleum-based. By one estimate the US requires 12m barrels of oil for the 100 billion bags its consumers use annually. The Delux factory&apos;s main competitive advantage is labour, which accounts for less than a 10th of the production costs of a plastic bag. Wages in Shenzhen are low and more than three-quarters of the population are internal migrants, many of them living in huge company dormitories far from their homes and families, working in dirty, dangerous conditions. Delux&apos;s pay and conditions are above average for Shenzhen. We are not allowed to talk to employees, but we are introduced to &quot;group leader&quot; Chen Ping, a migrant from Guangxi province, who says the situation has improved enormously since she started working and living in the factory 11 years ago. &quot;The managers realise they must let us eat and sleep better if they want us to work harder.&quot; Chen earns more than double the average factory salary, but her life is far from easy. Because she is a migrant, her two children will have to return to their home town to go to school, which means she will see them for only a few days each year at spring festival. But she expresses no sense of grievance, even though the western consumers who use her bags can easily pay more for a shirt than she earns in a month. &quot;I don&apos;t think it is unfair. We make these bags to be used. They have their own value.&quot; Plastic carrier bags are totemic of all kinds of issues to do with shopping - food miles, food packaging, profligate waste. They pose problems for wildlife. They block drains. Friends of the Earth says plastic bags, which account for only 0.3% of the UK&apos;s domestic waste stream, are not its top priority. However, it would like to see a tax on the 17 billion bags that are handed out to British shoppers every year. Degradable and biodegradable bags are &quot;not an environmentally friendly option&quot;, it says, and &quot;will lead to the public becoming increasingly confused as to what they are supposed to do with them. Degradable plastic bags usually can&apos;t be recycled with normal plastic bags, and people may think they can put degradable bags into their compost bins, which they can&apos;t.&quot; Degradable bags are still made from plastic, continuing to place demands on oil resources. They contain a metal additive to make them degrade and tend to require sunlight to break down. If biodegradable bags end up in landfill, they eventually produce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Paper bags are no better, says Friends of the Earth: they are less easily reused and require more energy and resources to make and transport than plastic alternatives. Bags made from recycled plastics, which are then reused or recycled, are considered by many to be a better option, but recycling points are not yet widely accessible. In any case, all too often a promise by municipal government to recycle simply means sending the rubbish to China. It is cheaper to ship a container of waste from London to Shenzhen to truck it to Manchester. Under EU law waste cannot be dumped abroad, but shipments for recycling are permitted. This means business for Guangdong province. There are the e-waste centres of Guiyu and Qingyuan, where families make a living from chopping up and melting down toxic plastics and metals from discarded computers, printers and mobile phones. Below them on the waste chain are the recyclers of plastic bags and bottles in Shunde and Heshan. Until recently the most notorious of these was in Nanhai, a town outside Guangzhou, where the streets were piled high with rubbish and the streams ran thick with pollution. In February, however, after a series of embarrassing reports in the British media, the government was shamed into shutting down the area and banning imports of foreign garbage. The streets of Nanhai are swept clean and the small recycling sheds are shuttered up. For many locals, however, this sudden concern about the environment is a financial disaster. &quot;We were ordered to close last month because some foreign rubbish contained toxins,&quot; says Ding Chunming, who used to process bottles and bags. &quot;It&apos;s a terrible blow because we only started this business last year. We get no compensation. All we can do is wait and hope the government allows us to restart business.&quot; But the industry has learned how to bypass laws and regulations. Many Nanhai &quot;refugees&quot; just moved their scrap heaps. Two hours&apos; drive away a recycling centre is under construction in Shijing village. The concrete is still wet on the floor and many of the sheds are only half-complete, but the task of buying, selling and sorting rubbish is in full flow. The operation is remarkably specialised. There are sections for discarded hotel welcome mats, the bases of revolving chairs, black buckets, the lids of shampoo bottles. One businesswoman, terrified that another critical news report will force her to relocate again, says: &quot;We have only just got here from Nanhai. I have never dealt with foreign waste. I can&apos;t do it now and I won&apos;t do it in the future.&quot; But for others the trade in foreign waste is too lucrative to disappear quickly. We were approached by a scrap dealer who asked if we had any rubbish to sell. He was after PVC, but he put us in touch with a factory in Shenzhen that said it could deal with carrier bags despite the ban. &quot;It can be done as long as the plastic is well enough packaged to get through customs,&quot; says the owner. &quot;You should ship them to Hong Kong and we will deal with them from there. If the bags are sorted by colour, we can pay you as much as $100 a tonne.&quot; Further away from the media spotlight and the scrutiny of environment officials, many factories are still reprocessing carrier bags and other rubbish from abroad despite the ban. Another hour&apos;s drive away in Shunde, rubbish from Europe is baled up on the roadside - British milk cartons, Dutch confectionery packaging, Italian nappies. Nearby in Mai, many villagers believe that the pollution is ruining their health. A doctor says the village suffers from an unusually high incidence of respiratory diseases. &quot;Perhaps it was the pollution or perhaps it was because everyone smokes cigarettes,&quot; he says. &quot;This is a sensitive topic. Of course we want a garden-like environment, but people here have to make a living.&quot; Others have different priorities. &quot;I don&apos;t care about the environment,&quot; says one labourer. &quot;I only want to make money. If your stomach isn&apos;t full, how can you worry about health?&quot; Everyone condemns as an eyesore the ditches full of carrier bags, but nobody seems to take responsibility for clearing up the mess. In fact the main concern of businessmen and officials is to avoid scrutiny. &quot;The government has banned imported waste because of the media attention,&quot; says one factory manager. &quot;The Nanhai recycling business has been completely shut down. This area doesn&apos;t want to suffer the same fate because it would hurt the government&apos;s income.&quot; Other countries are tackling the problem at differing speeds. British retailers will aim for a voluntary 25% reduction in carrier bag use by 2008. Elsewhere governments have started to act. Ireland introduced a &quot;plastax&quot; of about 30 cents on carrier bags in 2002, which has led to a 90% reduction in use. Australia has launched a &quot;Say No To Carrier Bags&quot; campaign. In Taiwan and Hong Kong the government obliges supermarkets to charge for bags at least two days a week. Italy is promoting biodegradable bags. In France reusable plastic bags - heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - account for more than half of the market. Inevitably even those eco-bags are made in Shenzhen. The main producer is the Richall Group. It was launched in 2003 with starting capital of less than $2,000. Last year it recorded sales of more than $6m. This year that figure is expected to triple. Richall&apos;s president, Liu Tianyan, says attitudes are changing. More importantly, so are materials. &quot;We&apos;re never going to get rid of plastic bags completely, because in some cases, such as food wrappings, there is no good substitute,&quot; he says. &quot;But in the case of shopping bags, I believe the flimsy plastic can be completely replaced.&quot; Not everyone thinks that would be a good thing. Peter Woodall, communications manager for the Carrier Bag Consortium, says, &quot;It&apos;s important to forget the emotion and look at the science. We are not filling our landfill with plastic bags. That is simply a myth. When real science is taken into account, the best environmental choice is plastic. Life cycle analysis shows that if you use a conventional bag four times and then recycle it, that is better than using a &apos;bag for life&apos;.&quot; Environmental campaigners believe that the solution is to make rich countries deal with their waste locally. &quot;That&apos;s the only way to make the whole community feel the impact,&quot; says Kevin May at Greenpeace&apos;s office in Beijing. &quot;If you can easily dump waste overseas, then there is no motive for having a waste-reduction programme at home. The argument that developing nations need recycled resources from wealthy nations is only partly true. The environmental costs are too high. Just look at the filthy water and polluted air of China. If we can stop the waste trade, I am sure it will lead to more sustainable development around the world.&quot; The apparent intractability of the problem is all the more remarkable considering that our dependency on the plastic bag is a recent phenomenon. Polythene was not even invented until the 1930s. Plastic bags did not become common in supermarkets until the 70s. The idea that we can&apos;t live without them is a very modern one.

At the centre of this was control of Chinachem, Hong Kong&apos;s biggest privately held property company, which also has real estate investments in Britain, a shipping company in Taiwan, entertainment businesses in Asia and North America, a US biotechnology firm, a Canadian video games enterprise and a meat-packing plant in China. In the ranks of sober-suited Hong Kong businessmen, Wang was an original with her pigtails, impish grin and miniskirts which, she said, she wore &quot;because I have great legs&quot;. Five feet tall, she turned up for business meetings with a large German shepherd dog, and sometimes took dinner guests to McDonald&apos;s, where she preferred the Filet-O-Fish. The last time I saw her, at a reception in a hotel in the Central district, she was carrying an aluminium case. It was, she explained, her handbag and &quot;good for hitting anyone who attacks me&quot;. Like many Hong Kong tycoons, she originated from Shanghai, where her father-in-law, Wang Din-shin, ran a successful chemicals, property and paint business under the nationalists and during the Japanese wartime occupation. In 1946, as civil war with the communists gripped China, he moved to Hong Kong with his son, Teddy. The young man&apos;s childhood friend Kung Yu-sum followed. They were married in 1956. She became known as Nina, and acquired the Cantonese nickname of Siu Tim-Tim - Little Sweetie - from a Japanese cartoon character. In later life, she commissioned a cartoon book about herself. Teddy built up Chinachem as a big player in Hong Kong&apos;s booming property market. Despite their wealth, he and his wife were known for their sense of economy. Nina bought her clothes at discount shops, and, when invited out to dinner, they were said to borrow Tupperware containers to take uneaten food home. Teddy applied his tight-fistedness to business, and made plenty of enemies. In 1983, he was kidnapped from his Mercedes as he was driven to work. Nina came up with a \u00a36m ransom, and Teddy was freed. He had been kept chained to a bed for 11 days and was found trussed up in a refrigerator where he had been held by the gang. It was said that he told his wife off for having paid too much. In 1990, Teddy was snatched again. A Hong Kong source once told me that, as a precaution, he had had a homing device fitted into the soles of his footwear; his shoes were found at the dock where the kidnappers took him on to a boat. He was never seen again. Subsequent evidence indicated that he was thrown over the side when a police vessel was sighted about to carry out a routine check. Refusing to accept that Teddy was dead until a formal legal ruling was delivered in 1999, Nina used her power of attorney to run and expand Chinachem as the &quot;chairlady&quot;. But she and her father-in-law became involved in the lengthy suit about different versions of Teddy&apos;s will. A first verdict in 2002 found that one version, leaving the dead man&apos;s assets to his wife, replete with uncharacteristic romantic expressions from stone-hearted Teddy, was a forgery. That handed the fortune to his aged father, who sat in his wheelchair in court staring straight ahead. Three years later, Nina won on appeal, gaining control of Chinachem for the rest of her life. Despite her eccentricities, she was a canny businesswoman, expanding the empire internationally, staying friends with both the People&apos;s Republic and Taiwan, earning political capital in the US by helping to fund the preservation of Bill Clinton&apos;s birthplace and giving $7m to Harvard for scholarships for Chinese officials. But, aware of her husband&apos;s fate, she was said to employ dozens of bodyguards. Yet she failed in her biggest ambition - to build the world&apos;s tallest structure on the Hong Kong waterfront. It was to be dedicated to Teddy, but called the Nina Tower. However, it was on the flight path to the new airport. So Little Sweetie never got her final memorial. \u00b7 Nina Wang, businesswoman, born September 29 1937; died April 3 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/apr/11/broadcasting.internationalnews", "publicationDate": "2007-04-11T11:14:52Z", "tags": ["Media", "Television industry", "World news"], "sentences": ["Recent spats include official criticism of an RTHK programme about gay marriage, of its coverage of Taiwan and Hong Kong&apos;s democracy movement, and of delayed broadcasting of a political debate."], "title": "Radical changes recommended for Hong Kong's media", "article": "Hong Kong could get a new public service media provider if the recommendations of a recent review are accepted - but the prospect has raised fears about the future of existing public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong. The sweeping review recommended a radical restructuring of Hong Kong&apos;s media sector, with a new public broadcaster providing several radio stations, at least one free television channel and multimedia platforms. A new statutory body, the Hong Kong Public Broadcasting Corporation, should be set up and be wholly government-funded while developing &quot;a combined funding model&quot;, the review concluded. This would mean finding donations and supplementary funding - excluding advertising - over time. But critics of the review claimed it provided no clarity on what the future held for the existing public broadcaster, Radio Television Hong Kong. &quot;This raises more questions than answers. It casts a cloud over the future of RTHK and creates deep uncertainty for the staff,&quot; said Francis Moriarty, the press freedom spokesman for Hong Kong&apos;s Foreign Correspondents&apos; Club and a senior member of RTHK staff. He accused the 14-month-old commission, set up to examine the future of broadcasting in Hong Kong, of interpreting its remit in &quot;the narrowest possible way&quot;. &quot;Will we be absorbed into government? Will we be cut loose? RTHK has established trust, a reputation, its independence over the years. If they start from scratch, all our hard work is not taken into account,&quot; said Mr Moriarty. A report by the Hong Kong Journalists&apos; Association last year, titled &quot;RTHK Under Siege&quot;, described RTHK as a symbol of the state of media freedoms in Hong Kong, which are more threatened than ever 10 years after Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule. RTHK is a government department and media freedom advocates say it should be reformed to guarantee its independence. Although less racy than its commercial counterparts, RTHK regularly has run-ins with the authorities over editorial content. Recent spats include official criticism of an RTHK programme about gay marriage, of its coverage of Taiwan and Hong Kong&apos;s democracy movement, and of delayed broadcasting of a political debate. However, the commission argued it would be too complex to transform RTHK, and said it was up to the government to decide what to do with one of its own departments. &quot;The committee has consciously steered away from discussing this matter, as it falls outside of the committee&apos;s terms of reference,&quot; the commission said. The commission report cites a &quot;strong public demand for quality current affairs programmes&quot;. Hundreds of submissions convinced the commission that the Hong Kong audience wanted more diversity, pluralism, focus on minority concerns and more creativity. The commission&apos;s report stressed the importance of editorial independence - but suggested members of the board of the new public service broadcasting body should be appointed by the Hong Kong chief executive. Under current Hong Kong law, the chief executive is virtually appointed by Beijing. The government said it would need several months to digest the recommendations before presenting any new plans for legislative approval. RTHK has broadcast in Hong Kong since 1928 - more than 30 years before the first commercial radio station was launched. It runs seven radio channels, including a rebroadcast of BBC World Service, and makes some television shows, which two local commercial TV stations are required to broadcast. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.

Now, after centuries of surviving on fish such as the tuna and shrimp that thrive in Pakistan&apos;s coastal waters, many traditional fishing communities are facing ruin as the sea is stripped bare by foreign trawler fleets and industrial overfishing. According to trade campaigners, it is a story that is being replicated in poor fishing communities in developing countries across the world. And as the current round of World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations splutter back to life, the demise of Pakistan&apos;s fishing communities is being held up as a warning of the impact that the moves to further liberalise global fishing could have on some of the world&apos;s most deprived communities. The Pakistani Maritime Security Agency (MSA), which polices fishing along Pakistan&apos;s coastline, says there are currently 23 mid-size trawling boats and 21 trans-national trawlers operating with licences in Pakistani waters. Local fishermen in Ibrahim Hydri, a small fishing town in the sparse Sindh coastal province, unload their fishing boats just yards from half-a-dozen trawlers with Chinese insignia in the town harbour. Many dispute the official figures, insisting that around 100 foreign ships have been spotted in local waters in the last 12 months. &quot;Since the government has let these foreign ships into our waters, our stocks have depleted and there is nothing left,&quot; says local fisherman Abbas Ali. &quot;For hundreds of years, our forefathers have fished these waters, but our children are going to end up beggars.&quot; He says the town&apos;s small wooden fishing boats are no match for the trawlers. &quot;It&apos;s like trying to race a truck with a bicycle,&quot; he says. &quot;In just a few years, these people have come here, destroyed the sea, and stolen our livelihoods from us.&quot; In recent years, Pakistan has steadily been stepping up its efforts to exploit what it terms the &quot;untapped potential&quot; of its fish stock. In 1982, the government opened its waters to international fishing fleets, and in 2003-04 alone more than 90,255 tonnes of fish and fishery products were exported from Pakistan, to countries including the UK, Japan and Sri Lanka. Pakistan&apos;s 2001 deep-sea policy set out a plan to further increase foreign exchange earnings from the increased export of fisheries and fishing products. The same policy relaxed regulations that restricted trawler activity to a zone 35km-200km from shore after pressure from &quot;friendly&quot; trading partners, such as China and Taiwan. Licensed medium-sized trawlers are now allowed to fish 20km from shore, an area previously reserved exclusively to protect the livelihood of local fisherfolk. Men scrubbing down their boats at Ibrahim Hydri say the impact trawling and overfishing has had on their livelihoods and on the marine environment has been devastating. They estimate that the daily catch has declined by 70%-80% in the last decade. Five years ago, it took Ali 36 hours to catch 1,000kg of fish that fed and supported his family. Now he and seven other men return after 15 days at sea with a catch that weighs in at just under 500kg. As he hauls his nets to shore, Ali reels off the names of more than a dozen fish species no longer found in the surrounding waters. Reports by the Pakistani Fisherfolk Forum (PFF), a environmental campaigning group set up to protect the rights of local fishing communities, says more than 50% of local marine species have been almost wiped out by intensive fishing of Pakistan&apos;s sovereign waters. According to its research, only 10% of the fish caught by the trawlers&apos; nets can be sold on the international markets, leading to the other 90% being pumped back into the sea and increasing marine pollution in shallow waters. &quot;Tonnes of fish that could have been used to sustain the livelihoods of local fisherman have been needlessly destroyed through foreign trawling,&quot; says Mohammad Ali Shah, chairman of PFF. Foreign trawlers, he says, are the &quot;last straw&quot; for fishermen who have seen their livelihoods destroyed in the name of progress. Pollution from the trawlers joins 300 million gallons of urban sewage and 270 tonnes of industrial waste that is pumped into the sea from multiple channels every day. Dams and barrages built with World Bank loans along the delta of the Indus, Pakistan&apos;s longest river, have starved marine channels of fresh water, resulting in many inland fishing communities migrating to the coastal waters in search of fish. Pollution and over-population have contributed to the demise of the mangroves that provided breeding grounds for shrimps that previously provided the backbone for much of the local economy. There is repeated criticism from environmental campaigners that, despite pressure from the UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Pakistan has yet to undertake an up-to-date fish stock survey. This means that licences to foreign trawling fleets could be issued without the government having a clear idea of how many fish are left in Pakistan&apos;s waters. In a new report, entitled Taking the Fish, ActionAid, one of the international non-governmental organisations working with PFF, says the exploitation of Pakistan&apos;s marine environment is being done with no regard for the environmental or social impact on communities or resources. It is now calling on Pakistan&apos;s government to ban foreign trawlers and institutionalise in its fishing policy the FAO&apos;s code of conduct for responsible fisheries. Moazzam Khan, deputy director of the Marine Fisheries Department (MFD) in Karachi, admits that Pakistan&apos;s fish stocks are fast depleting, but insists that the government has not issued licences to foreign trawlers since 2005, saying that the declining fish stock and rising fuel prices have made it uneconomical for foreign fleets to operate in Pakistan&apos;s waters. &quot;We always heavily regulated the trawling activity,&quot; he says. &quot;Although we are in talks about issuing further licences, we would not do so without assurances from the trawlers that they would fish in a sustainable manner.&quot; Khan believes the real problem lies in the growing number of people entering the fishing industry, and says the government is planning to institute no-fishing zones in an attempt to help stocks recover. But many fishermen dismiss the government&apos;s claims, saying they have never been visited by anyone from the MFD, and that they have seen no evidence of any moves to regulate fishing. &quot;The government has no idea what is happening here,&quot; says Mohammad Ali, a fisherman living in a makeshift tarpaulin hut in the village of Dabla Mohalla Rarri, a fishing community 15km from Ibrahim Hydri. &quot;There are many trawlers operating illegally in our waters. They stay away when the MSA comes, but when it leaves they come back. They come in so close they are nearly colliding with our fishing boats.&quot; Trade campaigners argue that even though three-quarters of the world&apos;s fish stocks are deemed to be fully exploited, countries including those in the EU, and the US and Japan, continue to subsidise their fishing industries by an estimated $6.3bn (\u00a33.2bn) a year. On top of this, the current round of WTO negotiations on subsidies and non-agricultural market access could lead to an elimination or significant reduction of all tariffs in the fish and fish products sector. Already five WTO members, including Brazil and India, have made offers to liberalise parts of their fishing services. Alex Wijeratna, author of Taking the Fish, and trade policy campaigner at ActionAid UK, says that since Pakistan joined the WTO in 1995 it has independently pursued a significantly more liberalised fish trade regime. &quot;If what is happening to poor fishing communities in Pakistan is already happening through bilateral trading agreements outside the WTO, we can only imagine the global impact it would have if liberalisation is locked in by the WTO,&quot; Wijeratna says. &quot;It&apos;s nothing short of mad short-termism.&quot; In Ibrahim Hydri, there is growing anger about the loss of its traditional livelihood. The community claims it has been duped by false promises of financial assistance, and that no effort has been made to provide alternative livelihoods. &quot;We are not against development, but what is happening here is not development - we are going backwards,&quot; says Shah. \u00b7 More information at actionaid.org.uk/takingthefish \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.

This week, Cheeta, the chimp from the original Tarzan films, reached the splendid age of 75 (though he has a few years to go before reaching the 79 clocked up by his co-star Johnny Weissmuller). Diabetic Cheeta, his fur now speckled with grey, celebrated with sugar-free cake and diet soft drinks at his home in the legendary retirement destination of Palm Springs, California, where he passes his days watching TV, painting and playing the piano. Cheeta is cited by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&apos;s oldest primate (that should be non-human primate, of course, but perhaps they were confused by his lifestyle). But verifying such titles is a difficult business. Consider the case of Adwaita the tortoise, who once belonged to the British colonial general Clive of India in the 18th century. One Wednesday last month, Adwaita was found dead in his enclosure in Alipore Zoo. His death was not unexpected - his shell had cracked some months before and a wound had developed, and he was, after all, somewhat advanced in life: West Bengal officials said records showed Adwaita was at least 150 years old, but other evidence suggested he was more like 255. It will take carbon-dating of his shell to determine his true age. At 255, Adwaita would beat Harriet the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, who was reportedly collected by Charles Darwin, and died aged 175 in 2006, and Tu&apos;i Malila, the radiated tortoise given to the royal family of Tonga by Captain James Cook, and who passed over aged 188 in 1965. The age of a fish is calculated in much the same way as one works out the age of a tree by counting its rings; most fish have growth rings on their scales known as annuli. This technique was used to estimate the age of Hanako, meaning &quot;flower maid&quot;, the world&apos;s oldest koi carp, who died in 1977 at the age of 226 years. Goldie, the oldest goldfish, had reached the age of 45 by the time he gasped his last in 2005. He was won at a fair in Budleigh Salterton in 1960, and by the time he died his skin had faded from a yellowy orange to a soft pink. Alas, Goldie never made it to the Guinness Book of World Records because there was no documentary evidence of his age. This is a common problem. While it is simple to check the age of a pedigree cat, for example, as it will wield a certificate of authenticity, the more common moggie comes with no such paperwork. In 2004, Whiskey, a 33-year-old tabby from Essex, staked his claim as Britain&apos;s oldest cat, but his owner was unable to prove the claim conclusively. As for the world title, the Guinness Book of World Records held that Creme Puff, a cat from Austin, Texas, died in 2005 aged 38 years and three days, though there has been much jostling for the crown. Guinness at present records the oldest living cat as Kataleena Lady, a 27-year-old Burmese born on March 11, 1977, in Australia. The title of oldest parrot is also much disputed. Some favour Charlie, a blue macaw allegedly bought by Winston Churchill two years before the start of the second world war, who now resides at a Surrey garden centre, where he fills the air with anti-Nazi tirades. Charlie&apos;s owner, who bought him from a pet shop in 1965, claims that he is 104. Unfortunately, the administrators of Chartwell, Churchill&apos;s former country home, state that they have no record of any parrot, while Churchill&apos;s daughter, Lady Soames, says her father never owned a macaw (though he did, once, have an African grey parrot named Polly). In 2004 Matilda, a 14-year-old bantam hen, was named the world oldest hen. The world&apos;s oldest dove, Methuselah (perhaps not its name since birth), is 31 years 6 months old. He was born in April 1975 and lives in Harxheim, Germany. It is naturally harder to tell the age of animals that keep their distance from humans, but a Manx shearwater aged 52 is believed to hold the title of the oldest known wild bird. It was first captured off the coast of Wales and ringed by ornithologists in May 1957, when it was between four and six years old, and recaptured in April 2003. It was estimated to have flown five million miles during its lifetime, the equivalent of circumnavigating the globe 200 times. Some of the humblest-seeming animals are also the longest-lived, like the ocean quahog, a mollusc with an estimated maximum lifespan of 225 years, and the tardigrade, or water bear. Tardigrades are tiny creatures, about the size of a pencil dot, and look much like caterpillars, with four pairs of legs ending in claws, and five body segments. They live mostly in mosses and lichens, beaches and water sediments, and can be found both high in the Himalayas and 4,000m deep in the sea, and from the polar regions to the equator. They are hardy little critters and, though they are they are 70% water, they are able to enter a &quot;cryptobiotic&quot; state, suspending their metabolism and living in a dehydrated state for years. It is believed that their lifespan can stretch to over a century. At the other end of the size scale, the oldest known elephant reached the ripe old age of 86. Lin Wang was originally from Myanmar, and was captured in 1943 by the Nationalist army from the Japanese troops, then transported to Taiwan in 1947. When he was captured, Lin Wang was nicknamed &quot;the Beautiful&quot;, but in his later years the people of Taiwan knew him affectionately as &quot;Grandpa Lin Wang&quot;.

Mr Wen, on the first visit to Japan by a Chinese leader for seven years, also urged his hosts to oppose Taiwanese independence, a move he said Beijing would &quot;never tolerate&quot;. &quot;Japan&apos;s invasions caused tremendous damage to the Chinese,&quot; Mr Wen said in the first address to the Japanese parliament by a senior Chinese politician for 22 years. &quot;The deep scars left in the hearts of the Chinese people cannot be described.&quot; In a speech televised live in both countries, Mr Wen noted that Japan had apologised for its wartime atrocities and that its people had also suffered, but said that the country&apos;s leaders had not done enough to demonstrate its remorse. &quot;To reflect on history is not to dwell on hard feelings but to remember and learn from the past in order to open a better future,&quot; he said. But he avoided mention of specific issues such as the 1937 Nanking massacre, during which China claims that Japanese troops killed as many as 300,000 civilians, as well as recent denials that Japan&apos;s military forced tens of thousands of Asian women into sexual slavery in the 1930s and 40s. &quot;[His] speech was very positive, and I thought it was good that he made forward-looking remarks on a broad range of issues,&quot; Yasuhisa Shiozaki, the chief cabinet secretary, said. Mr Wen did not say how Japan should attempt to make amends for atrocities committed during its 1937-45 occupation of large parts of China but, shortly before his visit, he urged the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, not to pay his respects at Yasukuni shrine, which honours Japan&apos;s war dead, including 14 class A war criminals. Mr Abe&apos;s predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, sent Sino-Japanese ties into freefall with his annual pilgrimages to Yasukuni. Mr Abe paid his respects there in secret last spring but has refused to say whether he would make further visits since becoming leader last October. Mr Wen is proving the consummate diplomat. This morning he donned a Beijing Olympics 2008 tracksuit and chatted to fellow joggers in Tokyo&apos;s Yoyogi park before joining a tai-chi session. Tomorrow he will play baseball with students in western Japan before returning to Beijing. This afternoon he was almost poetic in his analysis of China&apos;s often difficult relations with Japan. &quot;The development of our relations has gone through tempests and twists and turns,&quot; he said, &quot;but the foundation of our friendship is unshakeable just like Mount Tai and Mount Fuji.&quot; In the afternoon he met business leaders from both countries and urged Japanese firms to continue investing in China, which including Hong Kong is Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner, with two-way trade worth $240bn (\u00a3121bn) last year. China is also keen to take advantage of Japanese expertise in clean energy to promote sustainable economic growth at home. &quot;China must build a society that conserves its resources and protects its environment,&quot; Mr Wen said. He suggested China may soften its opposition to Japan&apos;s bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council, but warned it not to interfere in the issue of Taiwanese sovereignty by courting the island&apos;s pro-independence politicians. &quot;We will strive with all our might to achieve peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, but we will never tolerate Taiwan independence,&quot; he said. &quot;We hope that Japan can understand the highly sensitive nature of the Taiwan issue, abide by its pledges and handle the issue prudently.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/apr/19/htctoshipgoo", "publicationDate": "2007-04-19T11:36:58Z", "tags": ["Google", "Mobile phones", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s fast-growing HTC (High Tech Computer) has become well known as the leading supplier of Windows Mobile phones, and DigiTimes reports that it is &quot;now manufacturing Google handsets with shipments officially commencing at the end of 2007, according to handset component makers.&quot; Last December, David Smith, The Observer&apos;s technology correspondent, had a great story about the talks between Google and Orange: The future for Orange could soon be Google in your pocket."], "title": "HTC to ship Google handsets by year-end", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s fast-growing HTC (High Tech Computer) has become well known as the leading supplier of Windows Mobile phones, and DigiTimes reports that it is &quot;now manufacturing Google handsets with shipments officially commencing at the end of 2007, according to handset component makers.&quot; Last December, David Smith, The Observer&apos;s technology correspondent, had a great story about the talks between Google and Orange: The future for Orange could soon be Google in your pocket.

He referred inquiries about the issue, and the country&apos;s controversial relations with Sudan, Taiwan and Tibet, to Hein Verbruggen, a senior IOC member and chairman of the Beijing co-ordination commission. Rogge&apos;s curious reluctance to address issues that will be raised repeatedly in the build-up to the Games followed questions about whether China&apos;s political stance would overshadow next summer&apos;s Games. Twice Rogge referred the matter to Verbruggen, a move that was all the stranger as the president spoke about traffic issues, strictly a matter for his colleague. China&apos;s reluctance to use its influence over Sudan to ease the Darfur crisis brought protests in the US from the actress Mia Farrow, who criticised Steven Spielberg for advising Beijing on the opening ceremony, prompting him to write to the Chinese president. The torch-relay route to be announced today will be equally controversial, with Tibetan exiles protesting on Mount Everest yesterday and Taiwan reluctant to allow the torch route to lead directly from Taipei to mainland China. Verbruggen offered a stout defence of the IOC&apos;s position, maintaining that it is a non-political organisation that has brought positive change to China. Rogge limited himself to a general comment, describing the Games as &quot;a force for good wherever they are staged&quot;. A more forceful response will be required as the focus on Beijing 2008 intensifies. BBC faces China crisis The BBC is considering an offer of a camera position in Tiananmen Square for use in its news coverage of the Beijing Games. The corporation has not settled on its main position in the Olympic park yet but, along with other broadcasters, has been offered a pitch in the square, site of dissident action by hundreds of thousands of pro...#8209;democracy protestors brutally suppressed by the regime in 1989. Accepting the pitch would be hugely controversial, particularly as the BBC&apos;s news website is censored by the authorities and cannot be accessed from most internet connections. Despite the BBC&apos;s status as an Olympic rights holder, that ban is expected to remain in place during the Games. Salzburg tainted by drugs Salzburg may have come top of many observers&apos; rankings of yesterday&apos;s presentations by the cities bidding for the 2014 Winter Games but news of the unprecedented life bans handed down to six Austrian athletes by the IOC came as a huge blow. Attention in the ongoing investigation will now focus on the president of the Austrian Skiing Federation and vice-chairman of the Austrian National Olympic Committee, Peter Schr\u00f6cksnadel, whose role in the systematic doping exercise is expected to be investigated. Schr\u00f6cksnadel will come under significant internal pressure to stand down from both his posts to resurrect confidence in the bid. Accord brings discord Birmingham is bidding to host the Sport Accord conference in 2011, hoping that the proximity of the event to the London Olympics will attract some of the leading players in world sport to the Midlands. Brian Stocks, head of sport at the city council, has publicly questioned whether London can deliver on its promise to make the 2012 Olympics a truly national event and thinks hosting the event would deliver a blow for the regions. London have told Birmingham they have no objection to the bid but it remains to be seen if the IOC and the sporting federations will be supportive. City&apos;s private fears The bid by Ray Ranson, left, for Manchester City is understood to be backed by a private equity firm with a track record in backing companies deeply in debt. SISU Capital Private Equity Fund are thought to be Ranson&apos;s partner, raising concerns at the club that they are more interested in turning a profit with a heavily leveraged buy-out than in the club&apos;s long- term health. paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/27/sport.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-04-26T23:02:52Z", "tags": ["Sport"], "sentences": ["As the Games approach, human-rights groups and other critics of the Chinese communist party will continue to highlight the country&apos;s position on issues such as Tibet, Taiwan and Darfur, not to mention the question of internal dissent."], "title": "Beijing 2008: China have games under control", "article": "Shortly after sunrise yesterday at Beijing&apos;s National Stadium the intricately tangled steel structure known as the Bird&apos;s Nest resounded to a chorus of clanging hammers, whirring drills and the grinding gear of cranes. Outside, scores of workers in blue overalls and yellow hard hats picked at the soil with shovels and forks, landscaping baked earth that, according to the local organising committee, will next summer be greensward. Nearby an old man, armed only with a switch of twigs, battled in vain to keep the site clean. Such scenes of hard labour will be repeated today and on each of the 469 mornings that remain between now and the opening ceremony of the 2008 games. The vast Olympic Park - 1,135 hectares of scaffolding, concrete and dust rising on the northern edge of the capital - is a construction project of monumental proportions and firm evidence of China&apos;s epic ambitions for its Olympics. Even on a brief first visit to Beijing it is impossible to avoid the contrast with London&apos;s nascent plans. While the UK wrestles with budget controls and reassures a sceptical public and political class that cost controls and temporary venues will avoid a legacy of white elephants, Beijing is building 12 new venues, each of them hugely ambitious, some of them iconic, and will have spent an estimated $40bn on the Games by the time they begin. Even allowing for China&apos;s cheap and abundant workforce, and lax planning regulations, the scale is staggering. Next to the Bird&apos;s Nest the equally ambitious Water Cube aquatic centre is almost complete and across the road an indoor arena and broadcast centre rise from the dirt. All this is happening in sight of venues that hosted the 1990 Asian Games, including a full-scale stadium, athletes&apos; village and competition pools that have been converted into practice facilities. To the north of the stadium organisers matter-of-factly describe the forest, man-made river and artificial wetlands that will be in place in time for the Games. Meanwhile more than 300 kilometres of new roads, a subway line and a third terminal at the international airport will all be operational by August. This lavish transformation is not confined to bricks and mortar. Politically, culturally and economically the Chinese appear determined to grasp the opportunity presented by Beijing 2008 and ensure that, even if they do not go down as the best games in Olympic history, they will deserve to be remembered, in the broadest sense, as the greatest. Examples of this commitment abounded this week as the city hosted Sport Accord, an annual meeting of sports federations and the International Olympic Committee&apos;s executive committee. It is a significant event in the IOC&apos;s calendar but not one that you would necessarily expect a prime minister to clear his diary for. That is what happened at the opening ceremony, however, when the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, addressed the delegates. Almost as striking as the changing skyline has been the apparent willingness to tackle the most difficult issues confronting the city. Environmentally Beijing faces huge challenges, with the spring sunshine of the past few days the exception in a city where yellow, pollution-clogged skies are not uncommon. Last week the organising committee informed the IOC of more than 100 measures to tackle the issue, including the closure of factories, tougher emission controls on vehicles and &quot;dust control&quot;, which appears to be a euphemism for paving or concreting any area of loose ground. The project has spilled into most facets of Chinese life. Some 400 million children are said to be part of the Olympic education programme, 200 million playing some sort of sport, and 565 model schools promoting sport have been built. Lord Coe, chairman of the London Olympics, visited one this week and was impressed by what he saw. &quot;They are building a 400m running track suspended five metres off the ground, and underneath they are building a 50m swimming pool and basketball courts,&quot; he said. &quot;Beijing has done a remarkable job in using the opportunity to drive all their strategic goals, be it air quality, public transport infrastructure, or participation and education.&quot; While the positive aspects of the Beijing 2008 project are self-evident, and Olympic sponsors are rubbing their hands at the prospect of direct access to China&apos;s 300m teenagers, there remains significant unease. With the state planning to use the Games as a coming-out party for a new, outward-looking nation, critics fear the IOC has handed a propaganda coup to a country still under one-party rule. As the Games approach, human-rights groups and other critics of the Chinese communist party will continue to highlight the country&apos;s position on issues such as Tibet, Taiwan and Darfur, not to mention the question of internal dissent. Even in this most fraught of areas, however, the Olympics seem to have delivered progress. Beijing promised the IOC that the 30,000 journalists expected next summer would enjoy freedom of movement. Reporters are still detained occasionally but are generally released following a call to the foreign ministry. The domestic media remains severely restricted, of course, and the changes do not mean China now has a free press. Websites - including the BBC&apos;s news site - are still censored and the 1989 killings of protesters in Tiananmen Square are referred to as a &quot;political accident&quot; but it is legitimate to credit the Olympics with speeding some reform. A huge amount of construction remains to be done before the city is ready to welcome the world and much could yet go wrong. Sandstorms may blow in from the desert, pollution could still be a problem for athletes and the hundreds of thousands of visitors and media are unlikely to pass through without incident. But if, in the event, there are problems, it will not be for want of trying to address them. London preparing to follow extravaganza A veteran of organising every Olympic Games since Los Angeles in 1984 summarised London&apos;s predicament as the city that will succeed Beijing as Olympic host. &quot;As soon as Beijing won the 2008 vote I thought, &apos;I pity the poor sods who are going to have to follow that.&apos;&quot; China&apos;s commitment to making its Games the biggest ever means the British will have a tough act to follow. With that in mind a delegation from London has been in Beijing this week consulting with the Chinese authorities about its obligations for 2008. London&apos;s first genuine Olympic moment will come during the closing ceremony next year, when it will announce itself as the next Olympic city and preface the handover of the Olympic flag to the mayor of London. The challenge is to come up with a recognisably &quot;London&quot; message while not being overshadowed by the spectacular planned by Beijing. London&apos;s head of ceremonies, Bill Morris, has been in talks this week with the Beijing ceremony team. The London Games chairman, Lord Coe, is not daunted by following Beijing. &quot;People are reasonable enough to know that each city is different and has different goals and London is not going to stage a Games in the same way as Beijing,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/27/sport.comment2", "publicationDate": "2007-04-26T23:03:56Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "sentences": ["Torch will not lighten Sino-Taiwanese relations The Beijing Olympic torch relay sparked predictable controversy last night when Taiwan rejected an invitation to be on the route."], "title": "Digger: Youth Olympics questioned", "article": "Jacques Rogge may face opposition to his plans to introduce a Youth Olympics in 2010. The initiative by the president of the International Olympic Committee has led to disquiet in Olympic circles, with some influential figures privately questioning whether the idea will dilute the value of the Olympic brand, the most recognisable and valuable in sport. Coming only two years before London hosts the 2012 summer Games, and within months of the Vancouver winter Olympics, there is concern that the extra event may lead to Olympic fatigue among audiences. Some are also voicing concerns that because the IOC executive board will choose the venue it could lead to a dilution of the power of ordinary IOC members. Rogge believes the event, based on the model of the European Youth Games and featuring athletes aged between 14 and 18, will help re-engage the young audience that appears to be losing interest in Olympic sports. The average age of track-and-field viewers is over 40 and the Olympic movement is acutely aware of the need to reinvigorate the audience. The full membership of the IOC will debate the issue at its congress in Guatemala in July but it remains to be seen whether the disquiet will translate itself into a motion to oppose the president&apos;s plan, which is being seen as part of his legacy to the movement. Torch will not lighten Sino-Taiwanese relations The Beijing Olympic torch relay sparked predictable controversy last night when Taiwan rejected an invitation to be on the route. The Chinese island is seeking recognition as an independent state and objected because according to the announced route the torch would leave its shores directly to China, specifically to Hong Kong. London has no such reservations and the torch will arrive on April 6 next year. Share and share alike The United States Olympic Committee is under fire from sporting federations demanding it receive a smaller slice of TV revenues. USOC has historically received a larger cut of IOC income than other national Olympic committees - it receives 20% of marketing revenues and 12.75% of TV income. The sports federations which believe they are being denied income by the US deal raised the issue this week and their concerns have been passed to Jacques Rogge. Advertising break Sir Martin Sorrell, head of the advertising group WPP, made a speech at Sport Accord yesterday and left with an IOC contract in his back pocket. The address, about sponsorship, rights and broadcasting, went down well and later in the day his company, United, picked up the account for the Olympic movement&apos;s latest marketing campaign.  paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/27/china.sport", "publicationDate": "2007-04-26T23:54:47Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Sport", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Olympic movement risked being dragged into a diplomatic row between China and Taiwan last night after Taipei refused to accept China&apos;s planned route for the 2008 Olympic torch relay, which runs through the island.", "Within hours of Beijing&apos;s announcement of what would be the longest torch relay in Olympic history - an 85,000-mile, 130-day route that would cross five continents and scale Mount Everest - Taiwan rejected the plan.", "But the Taiwan stop is scheduled to be followed by Hong Kong and Macau, suggesting that it is part of the Chinese domestic route, which will wind through the country before culminating at the National Stadium on August 8.", "Taiwan&apos;s ruling Democratic Progressive party said last week it would not accept a place on the relay if the torch entered or left the island via mainland China or Hong Kong and Macau.", "&quot;It is something that the government and people cannot accept,&quot; Tsai Chen-wei, the head of Taiwan&apos;s Olympic committee, said.", "&quot;I sincerely hope that Taiwan compatriots can enjoy the glories and joy of the torch relay,&quot; Jiang Xiaoyu, executive vice president of the Beijing Olympic organising committee, said.", "Mr Jiang repeatedly referred to Taipei, Hong Kong and Macau as overseas Chinese cities, a characterisation likely to upset Taiwan."], "title": "Taiwan rejects China's planned route for Olympic torch", "article": "The Olympic movement risked being dragged into a diplomatic row between China and Taiwan last night after Taipei refused to accept China&apos;s planned route for the 2008 Olympic torch relay, which runs through the island.

This game today is stopping a war. There has been fighting in Sri Lanka for over 30 years. Over 60,000 have died. That&apos;s a whole mass of issues I&apos;m not even remotely able to begin to address. What I can do is tell you this: when the Sri Lankan cricket team is playing, the fighting stops. At half past nine in the evening Sri Lankan time almost 20 million people will be gathered around their TVs, watching this game. Leaving work the other day there was a kafuffle of people around my bus stop. They were dressed in Sri Lankan shirts, and were holding cricket bats, and they were protesting against, of all things, Amnesty International. Their complaint was that Amnesty&apos;s &apos;Play by the Rules&apos; campaign was exploiting the country&apos;s love of cricket for political ends. The Sri Lankan cricket team, their spokeswomen told me, was the one thing that rose above the politics of the conflict and brought the country together. Now, and for the next seven hours, no bombs will explode, no bullets will be fired, and no one will be killed. So don&apos;t listen to those folks, hacks mainly who tell you that &apos;globally cricket just isn&apos;t as important as football&apos; or that &apos;no one cares about this match that much&apos; or that &apos;the whole tournament has been rubbish&apos; because they&apos;re all wrong, don&apos;t listen to those men in suits on the BBC and Sky who want you to watch the latest unravellings of yet another weekend in English football. This is the World Cup final, and it&apos;s between the two best teams in the tournament. But hey, I&apos;m preaching to the already converted right? Else you wouldn&apos;t be here on this page right now. &quot; Something else you might have heard a lot in recent days is this: &apos;my heart says Sri Lanka and my head says Australia&apos;. I never liked the part of my head that tells me things like that. It&apos;s the same bit that tells me to go home early when because I have to get up tomorrow, that I don&apos;t want that last drink, that I should quit smoking right now, that I should stick a fiver on the favourite. I&apos;m going with heart. All the way. Even if it does mean that my mucker Rob Smyth&apos;s World Cup tip will turn out to be hideously true. This will be the first time since 2005 that Australia will have come up against a bowling attack that is better than their own. For me, that&apos;s the crucial fact about this match. But there is so much more to say, to write about. Surely it&apos;s Jayasuriya&apos;s last game? Certainly it&apos;s McGrath&apos;s, possibly Gilchrist&apos;s and Hayden&apos;s too. Who will get that rare privilege of ending their career in the best possible circumstance? There&apos;s so much to say and I&apos;m not going to do it all.

Yes yes yes yes yes this is it, after four years, and fifty matches, this is it. And then like a hefty boot to the guts the credits stop rolling, Gower greets us and.... it&apos;s raining. The covers are on. Sickening. Michael Eddleston isn&apos;t the first person to call me naive during this World Cup. But hey, I&apos;m happy to admit it. A little naivety is essential in my line of work. As I suggested at the top of the page Michael, there are some seriously complex issues that I&apos;m not about to attempt to deal with. The idea that fighting ceases during important cricket games comes from two sides: Tamil Tiger spokesman Rasiah Ilanthiriyan, and the representative of the Campaign for Peace &amp; Unity in Sri Lanka I spoke to last week. It is well documented, and you can substantiate it with a quick web search. That doesn&apos;t mean you have to believe it. On a lighter note Keith Flett, ceaseless champion of facial fashion, has revealed this: &quot;The Beard Liberation Front, the informal network of beard wearers, has said that Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds and Sri Lankan spinner Muralitharan have shared the award for the Beard of the cricket World Cup 2007. England spin bowler Monty Panesar was runner-up.&quot; It is not clear whether the Beard Liberation Front&apos;s revolutionary activities will be called into temporary ceasefire during the Cup final. Australia have won the toss and will bat first. Sri Lanka look like this: WU Tharanga, ST Jayasuriya, KC Sangakkara, DPMD Jayawardene, LPC Silva, TM Dilshan, RP Arnold, WPUJC Vaas, SL Malinga, M Muralitharan, CRD Fernando. While Australia look like this: AC Gilchrist, ML Hayden, RT Ponting, MJ Clarke, A Symonds, MEK Hussey, SR Watson, GB Hogg, NW Bracken, SW Tait, GD McGrath. No changes from the semi finals for either side then. And we&apos;re going to get the crunch confrontation straight up front: the best batting team versus the best bowling attack. Inside I&apos;m giggling like a nervous schoolgirl at her first prom. This is going to be great. Is there such a thing as the perfect team? Australia have had the perfect World Cup - the closest they&apos;ve come to losing a game is the 83-run thrashing they inflicted on South Africa in the third game of the group stages. A win today and there&apos;ll be no mitigations on the fact that they are one of the greatest teams ever to play any sport. Are they due one bad match? Amalie Wijesundera is in the horns of a dilemma: &quot;I&apos;m a mess, an utter broken pile of rubble and the game hasn&apos;t even started yet. What does one do as a Sri Lankan fan when watching the final is like pulling teeth out without medication but not watching it is as inconceivable as me streaking across the Kensington Oval right now.&quot; All the more inconceivable it is, Amalie, because right now it is raining very hard again in Bridgetown. Your nerves are going to get a lot more frayed. Chris Anderson has kindly provided this address - livesportson.tv - for those seeking live pictures of the rain falling to go with their words. Otherwise Dave Copeland is suggesting that we all &quot;hop on a plane to Taiwan. I am sat in the Brass Monkey with some Sri Lankan friends holding fire against the Aussie crowd surrounding us, enjoying the highlights from the semis. Hope the rain stops before the beer runs out.&quot; See you there in five, Dave. It is still raining. I am contemplating jacking it in leaving my clothes in a pile on the beach and disappearing to some sunny part of the world where they&apos;ve no interest in cricket. Well, the covers are off and Gower is telling us that we&apos;ll be starting in 25 minutes! HUZZAH! That means quarter past five London time for those of you who like a little precision. 38 overs a side it is too. The air is tinged with more than a little worry that a reduced overs game is going to work in Australia&apos;s favour. They might just be able to bludgeon their way through the 38 overs. Plus, the ball is going to be wet, which will annoy Murali and his fellow spinners. Beefy Botham is telling us that the pitch is bone dry. And a little flat into the deal too. Anyway, shrug off all those worries and doubts, forget the damp squibery, we&apos;ve got a game and that&apos;s all that matters. Some more titbits you might like to know: three bowlers can bowl eight overs, two seven, and the third Powerplay is ditched. Come on come on come on come on come on come on as soon as Sky cut back from this interview with Tom Moody I&apos;m expecting to see players on the pitch and a seething roaring crowd. And that is just what we&apos;ve got.... it&apos;s starting. 1st over: Australia 2-0 (Hayden 1 Gilchrist 1) After all that waiting too, this is so exciting. Chaminda Vaas will open the attack, Hayden and Gilchrist are marking their territory, prodding the turf, Aleem Dar is checking his watch, Ian Botham is waffling and we&apos;re off... the first ball is swing free and driven straight to mid-off. The second drifts onto leg and Gilchrist tucks it square for a single. Hayden knocks his first ball gently down the pitch. He does the same thing with his second, and this pitch looks flat, true and free of help for the bowlers. Vaas doesn&apos;t want to admit that though, and pitches another one on leg in search of some swing. He doesn&apos;t get it, and Hayden clouts a run to fine leg. 2nd over: Australia 4-0 (Hayden 2 Gilchrist 2) From the other end, Australia will get a first look at the revelatory Lasith Malinga, whose opening spell against New Zealand was one of the best ever, yes, ever. His first ball is neatly on line and played away nervously by Hayden. His second is dabbed out to square leg for one. He pushes the third menacingly up near Gilchrist&apos;s toes, but it&apos;s calmly clipped away. Next, Gilchrist spoons a run away to short fine leg with an ungainly swipe. A pair of dots close the over and it&apos;s a sedate start from the Aussies. 3rd over: Australia 16-0 (Hayden 2 Gilchrist 14) Vaas has straightened his line in lieu of the absence of movement in the air. He&apos;s not straight enough though, as Gilchrist picks up the second and swishes it high over square over leg and away to the ropes for four. Ah and he&apos;s murdered the next, Vaas is looking distinctly vulnerable here, Gilchrist stepped down and smashed that ball way away over long-on for six! It prompts the ever-shrewd Sangakkara to stand up to the stumps, a ploy we&apos;ve seen the Lankan&apos;s exercise brilliantly throughout this Cup. &quot;C&apos;mon Vaasy&quot; the &apos;keeper exhorts, and he sends down a slower ball which Gilchrist edges away for two runs to third man. 4th over: Australia 16-0 (Hayden 2 Gilchrist 14) Malinga&apos;s line is impeccable, planted back of a length and spitting up towards Hayden&apos;s hip. He&apos;s not in a hurry, Hayden. Rather, he&apos;s happy to watch Gichrist hammer Vaas and wait. He&apos;ll know that if he bats twenty or thirty overs Australia will have a huge total regardless. So it&apos;s a maiden, as Hayden shoulders his bat and watches the sixth ball fly by wide of off stump. 5th over: Australia 26-0 (Hayden 6 Gilchrist 19) Ow, Gilchrist is entirely untroubled by Vaas&apos;s latest, which he swats to fine leg for four with extra relish. He&apos;s a little flumoxed by the next as he attempts a cut but is undone by extra bounce and cut on the ball. A single gives Hayden strike, it&apos;ll be interesting to see whether he&apos;s going to attack now too. The answer appears to be no. He blocks out two more, one of which is a no ball. Oh, looks like he&apos;s changed his mind: Vaas gives him a little width and he responds by lofting a drive high over cover and away for four. Ten from the over and Vaas has made an ugly start - time for a bowling change? 6th over: Australia 27-0 (Hayden 6 Gilchrist 20) Gilchrist whips another run off his hips. There&apos;s no width whatsoever on offer from Malinga, and these wise old Aussies are treating him with great suspicion. Trouble is they&apos;ll surely be targeting Vaas and Fernando to make up for the lack of runs they&apos;re taking off Malinga. 7th over: Australia 32-0 (Hayden 10 Gilchrist 23) Fernando is on for Vaas. He produced the perfect counterpoint to Malinga&apos;s brilliance in the last game by producing one of the shoddiest spells of bowling of the whole tournament. He could be utterly punished here. Indeed, his first ball, from around the wicket, is thumped away with a crack to the cover fieldsman. The third is swung to mid-on where Farveez Maharoof, on as a sub, makes a good diving stop. Hayden swings and misses at the next drawing a firework&apos;s night worth of oo&apos;s and ah&apos;s from the crowd. The sixth ball is larrupped away with considerable contempt for four runs to mid-wicket. 8th over: Australia 35-0 (Hayden 10 Gilchrist 23) Gilchrist punches a couple out to the leg side. Quieter still than this over is my inbox, where the curious dearth of new entries can only suggest that you all find our coverage of the rain much more entertaining.... 9th over: Australia 43-0 (Hayden 11 Gilchrist 31) The batsmen swap singles. Jeez, it&apos;s going to need something really inspired from Murali to turn this game around. Gilchrist swivels through a mighty pull that, even though it skewed away off the bat, flies well over the infield and plops down on the turf, by which time they&apos;ve run two. The sixth ball is a little more emphatic, as Gilchrist stands up and batters it over mid-off and down the ground for four. 10th over: Australia 46-0 (Hayden 11 Gilchrist 31) Vaas returns, from the other end, and he needs to get this right. Right now. Before it&apos;s all far too late and he&apos;s sat in a bar tossing a cheap whisky down his throat muttering &quot;sure I used to be a cricketer, it&apos;s a tough racket&quot;. And he&apos;s at least nearer the mark, Hayden guides his first ball along the turf to gully, and blocks the next. I guess Sanjay Ziddi has it right when he says: &quot;It&apos;s hard to concentrate on writing while you&apos;re staring hard at the computer screen hoping to see the word &quot;Wicket&quot; come up.&quot; Hayden has slashed a couple of chips down the ground, either side of the wicket but without reaching the ropes. 11th over: Australia 62-0 (Hayden 11 Gilchrist 46) Jayawardene has held back the second power play, as he did to such good effect against England. Dropped him! Tough as it was it was still a chance. Gilchrist drove the ball low and Fernando stooped to his ankles but couldn&apos;t cling on. It&apos;s unsettled him, and the next ball is a rather rank full toss that Gilchrist swipes away to leg for four. The next is worse still, though the shot was superb, thumped down the ground viciously past Hayden for four. Like Russian dolls it&apos;s all opened up onto something worse: the next ball is clouted tremendously over mid-wicket for an enormous six. This game is brinking on being done. I don&apos;t know where Glenn Reynolds is, but I&apos;m worried for his mind: &quot;I have 68 overs to catch, only ginger beer, and a dodgy satellite link. Swine sea conditions. My boat mocks me!&quot; 12th over: Australia 64-0 (Hayden 15 Gilchrist 46) Here&apos;s the match then, as Murali is on. What else could Jayawardene do? Oh and the Aussies aren&apos;t swaggering so much now! Murali makes Gilchrist look like an amateur with a brilliant first over. One spits through the gate, another almost has him around his legs. There is a wide as well, and one that&apos;s clipped out for a single. &quot;Perhaps&quot; Peter Lucas suggests &quot;everyone thinks this is going to be a procession. If Sri Lanka don&apos;t take a quick wicket or two people will just watch Doctor Who then &apos;Allo &apos;Allo at 21:00.&quot; Ah wait just a second - it&apos;ll be the spinners that decide how this innings goes. 13th over: Australia 68-0 (Hayden 17 Gilchrist 48) Dilshan is on at the other end. It&apos;s an indifferent beginning, the batsmen taking singles from each of the first four balls. Jeff Feim screams: &quot;The ICC deserved considerable stick over this tournament. Badly organized, too long, sudden death early round configuration robbed the fans of seeing the world&apos;s best professional players, making it financially impossible for local fans to attend, banning celebratory fan activity in the West Indies, impossible to hear it on the BBC outside the UK......need I go on. And now we get 24 overs chopped off the final game to decide a tournament of 50 over a side cricket because the must stick to the bloody schedule. Pathetic. Can anyone imagine the ICC doing more to smite the very fans that keep this game funded?&quot; Nothing we haven&apos;t heard, can&apos;t we just try and enjoy this game while it&apos;s on, or at least, all moan about Australia rather than the suits. 14th over: Australia 75-0 (Hayden 19 Gilchrist 53) Gilchrist&apos;s fifty is up, off 43 balls. What a performance from him. The Australians have decided to start sweeping Murali away around the corner, a tactic which brings them seven runs from the over and dries up that ever-diminishing well of hope a little further. 15th over: Australia 95-0 (Hayden 21 Gilchrist 67) Gilchrist carts a huge six down the ground, a shot so vast that it eludes Sky&apos;s camerman altogether and leaves him searching frantically across the clouds for a sight. Dilshan&apos;s woes magnify as he sends down a wide that runs all the way to the ropes. This is just so ugly, Gilchrist is going beserk, a skip, a Fred Astaire swish of the feet and he&apos;s lofted another huge six away into the stand at long-off. This is a horrendously brutal innings. 16th over: Australia 98-0 (Hayden 23 Gilchrist 68) &quot;As the great Glenn McGrath will bow out after this World Cup final, can we expect to see him flatten a Sri Lankan with his head?&quot; Chris Burke nodding to Zinedine Zidane, it&apos;d be lovely to see that wouldn&apos;t it? Another wide for Murali, as he mixes in some doosras. Not for the first time, it&apos;s a tale of two ends and two different matches, how they must wish Murali and Malinga could bowl all 38 overs. 17th over: Australia 112-0 (Hayden 25 Gilchrist 80) There&apos;s no luck for Fernando, a slower ball leaves Gilchrist groping helplessly outside off. The second ball is hit hard, fast and just wide enough of long-on to turn a potential catch into a six, Gilchrist smacks four from the next too, down the other side of the wicket to the ropes at long-on. Aye aye Amie Bingham; &quot;Heres another suggestion: how about instead of whinging about the ICC, and whinging about Australia, we all just enjoy a cricket game? I&apos;m so over everyone having a go at the Aussies. They win. Everyone else loses. It&apos;s not their fault that nobody else can match their skill - and quite frankly, even if they are arrogant....if being completely dominant in a sport doesn&apos;t give you the right to a little self confidence, what does? And, as someone else pointed out, whilst they play hard, they win and lose well.&quot; Well looks like we&apos;ve all got the choice: love them or detest them, either way they&apos;re going to win. Again. 18th over: Australia 122-0 (Hayden 25 Gilchrist 88) I can&apos;t believe how the Australians have stomped all over this match. They&apos;ve killed it, in just 17 overs worth of cricket. It really is exceptional stuff. I&apos;m trying to sound happy about it? Convincing? No, I didn&apos;t think so. How about when I tell you that Gilchrist has just slog swept a unbelievably big six off of Murali, all the way into the top tier of the stand at mid-wicket. He pushes two off the next, slips mid-pitch on his way and is then spared some trouble by a fumble in the outfield. 19th over: Australia 135-0 (Hayden 29 Gilchrist 95) Hayden squirts four off his outside edge through the understandably vacant slips. Gilchrist has two balls to break his partner&apos;s recent record for fastest World Cup century. Sadly, he only hits four off the first of them so he won&apos;t get the record. People talk about how the Lankan&apos;s reinvented one-day batting in 1996, so what are these two doing? Perfecting it? They&apos;ve just passed, hilariously, the record stand for the first wicket in a World Cup final, which was held, deliciously, by those two dashers Boycott and Brearley. 20th over: Australia 137-0 (Hayden 30 Gilchrist 95) You know I really thought this match would be different. How foolish I am. Vaas is back on still swingless, like a cowboy who forgot to bring his gun to the OK Corral. Jayawardene has clearly realised that the scoring rate couldn&apos;t be any worse so he&apos;s called a power play. &quot;Can we have the rain back please?&quot; asks Ben Day, aye, those were the good times. Gilchrist chips a looping ball over towards mid-on but the ball drops five yards in front of the fielder. Whatever luck there is to be had the Sri Lankans haven&apos;t had it. 21st over: Australia 149-0 (Hayden 38 Gilchrist 100) Malinga, who has given up just six of those Aussie runs, immediately gives up six more as Hayden swings his arms and lofts a savage and inelegant drive an absurd height into the air, and watches it land over the ropes at long-off. David Keech introduces the sound of desperate optimism: &quot;Last time I looked there were only 17 overs gone. Where&apos;s all this doom and gloom? OK Australia don&apos;t make a habit of cocking up starts like this but one wicket and it could still get interesting. Sri Lanka also have some blokes who can bat a bit. So while its odds on Australia I for one still think it is not a forgone conclusion just yet. Even though a wicket in the next couple of overs is essential.&quot; Meanwhile Gilchrist has brought up the fastest hundred ever scored in a World Cup final, with eight fours and six sixes in just 72 balls. And he should have gone! Malinga finds the edge and Sangakkara swoops to his right, taking the ball in the fingers of his gloves, and it just...bobbles...out as he hits the floor. It would have been brilliant, but as it is it&apos;s nothing other than good sportsmanship as he admits the drop. Gilchrist skewers the next off his leading edge and the ball just evades the fielder at third man. 22nd over: Australia 162-0 (Hayden 38 Gilchrist 109) &quot;Sorry, is this a cricket game?&quot; enquires Lou Roper &quot;When will the umpires stop it on the grounds that the punishment administered here may cause permanent damage?&quot; The over begins with a four, continues with five wides, and gets worse still with another four. Its forced Sangakkara back from the stumps, which is a neat way of illustrating how Australia are bullying Sri Lanka out of this game. WICKET! Hayden 38 c Jayawardene b Malinga (23rd over: Australia 172-1) Following on from the rather erudite Ian Healy quip mentioned by David Hopps in this piece, Pepp has contributed this fine line for the rest of us to enjoy: &quot;Former Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy after the sports news : &quot;And overnight a helpline has been set up for English cricket. The number is 1800 101010. That&apos;s one eight hundred, won nothing, won nothing, won nothing.&quot; Gilchrist has bunted four down the ground with a miscued drive off Malinga. This isn&apos;t cricket, it&apos;s assault and battery. Gilchrist carves four more over mid-wicket and biffs a single for good measure. I wonder if this will be his farewell innings? And that might be Hayden&apos;s! He&apos;s gone, and at last Sri Lanka have something to celebrate. He tired to loft a drive over cover, but Mahela Jayawardene leapt expertly and took the ball high above his head in both hands. Ricky Ponting has just sprinted to the wicket. 24th over: Australia 176-1 (Gilchrist 120 Ponting 1) &quot;To look on the bright side...&quot; yet more attempts at good humour, these from Ruth Goodwin, &quot;since the Aussie openers are thrashing the SL attack, at least there will be no doubt that the match might have been different with extra overs!&quot; It would have been much much worse - the less time Gilchrist has to bat the better for Sri Lanka. He&apos;s produced one of the most terrifying one day innings ever. In fact it wouldn&apos;t be that surprising if he breaks Saeed Anwar&apos;s record highest score in ODIs. I&apos;m doing my best to jinx him here folks. You can&apos;t play against this stuff, you&apos;re lucky if you get out of it alive and with a few shreds of your dignity and reputation to keep. 25th over: Australia 180-1 (Gilchrist 122 Ponting 4) Jayasuriya is on. &quot;Thank goodness&quot; says Simon Verlaque in an unparalleled piece of straw clutching, &quot;that they got dreary Hayden with his 70.37 strike rate out. Let&apos;s hope Ponting picks the pace up a bit.&quot; Four runs from this over. 26th over: Australia 186-1 (Gilchrist 124 Ponting 5) Murali has come back on to see what he can do to resist this horror show. Not much, is the answer. &quot;Those old buggers who harp on about the 1970 football world cup, give the impression that the Brazil team of the time was unstoppable - but don&apos;t you wish you were old enough to have actually seen them in action. This Aussie team may well be the equivalent for our generation of sports fans - it may not be hugely competitive, but one day we are going to bore the pants off a younger generation that we actually saw them in action.&quot; Iain Pearson might well be right, you&apos;d struggle to find a better team anywhere, doing anything. 27th over: Australia 194-1 (Gilchrist 132 Ponting 7) Gilchrist drops to a crouch with a cock of his back knee and swings a huge six away over mid wicket with a tremendous woodsman&apos;s waft of a shot. 28th over: Australia 203-1 (Gilchrist 134 Ponting 12) Ponting gets his own first boundary with a sweep that skims the ball across the turf where it beats Lasith Malinga&apos;s dive at fine leg and bobbles over the rope. Gilchrist drops a slog sweep exactly between the flailing mid-wicket and long-on, both running clutching, desperate for the catch. Neither gets it. Murali squeezes out a disbelieving lbw appeal from the next ball. 29th over: Australia 216-1 (Gilchrist 142 Ponting 14) Ten overs to go, which means we might get to see some big hitting at last. What&apos;s the best the Lankans can do from here? Not that: Jayasuriya shanks a full toss down on to leg stump and Gilchrist smashes it away high over mid-wicket and into the stand for six. This is like watching one long highlights package. Gilchrist has played more big shots in this innings than England managed in the entire tournament. 30th over: Australia 222-1 (Gilchrist 147 Ponting 19) Is this a benefit match? I&apos;m told that over on TMS Sir Viv is asking that very same question. This is comic book batting really, entirely unreal.  WICKET! Gilchrist 149 c Silva b Fernando (31st over: Australia 226-2) Dilhara &apos;5-0-56-0&apos; Fernando is back on. Jayasuriya shies at the stumps from short fine leg, but the throw misses, whistling by the stumps with his bat still out of the ground. And he&apos;s gone! One of the great one day innings in history comes to a quick end, but then it was a very quick innings all round. Fernando stuck in a bouncer and Gilchrist finally miss-hit one, high, looping off the top edge as he pulled it, and Silva was underneath to take the catch. That innings defied reason, sense, history, technique and precedent. It was truly extraordinary. And it&apos;s left Australia in a winning position. Oh look, it&apos;s Andrew Symonds. 32nd over: Australia 231-2 (Ponting 24 Symonds 2) Jayasuriya draws a dab to the off and a quick single with his first ball back in the attack. Symonds repeats the trick to the next. Dilshan dives to cut off a drive at mid-on and hurls at the stumps, but misses, as Symonds slides his bat in. 33rd over: Australia 237-2 (Ponting 26 Symonds 5) Wind up the organ and start stroking the violins, Gary Naylor has begun the Gilchrist testimonials already: &quot;Whilst his retirement will be the right time to eulogise Gilchrist, the ball before he was out, he ran a suicidal single to short fine leg - not because the run was there, but because the match situation demanded it. Has any cricketer been so consistently unselfish?&quot; He could have been even more unselfish and let us have a proper game of it in this final though Gary, couldn&apos;t he? Huh? Had to spoil it all with one of the great innings of all time though didn&apos;t he? Git. 34th over: Australia 243-2 (Ponting 26 Symonds 9) Symonds busts four runs through long-off with a clipped drive. That&apos;s all he gets from this over though, as Jayasuriya pegs him back with a pair of yorkers and draws him in to a poor reverse sweep. 35th over: Australia 257-2 (Ponting 34 Symonds 15) Lasith Malinga returns for a final flourish, to see what effect his yorkers have on this late dash by Ponting and Symonds. He kisses the ball, runs in, pitches it up, and Ponting swats a run to mid-on. Symonds swings and bludgeons four more onto this already dizzying total. Ponting hits a straight six that seems to somehow epitomise all the effortless aggression and skill with which his side have played today. The ball was full, straight and quick; Ponting just lifted it away for six over long on, with a straight bat and a clean swing. WICKET! Ponting 37 run out Jayawardene (36th over: Australia 264-3) Chaminda Vaas gets the other short straw, and resorts to a waist high full toss. That is squeezed away for one, after which Steve Bucknor gives Ponting a little warning about running down the middle of the pitch. Symonds strikes the next ball to mid-off where Jayawardene gathers and hurls a fast flat throw into the stumps, Ponting keeps running on his way back into the pavilion he&apos;d given up half way down the pitch because the run was never on. That wicket allows Shane Watson a crack at having a late biff. WICKET! Watson 3 b Malinga 37th over: Australia 272-4) &quot;Australia are in all sorts of trouble&quot; bellows GU pod guru Rob Curling, and how right he is. Oh, wait, no he&apos;s not. Watson made himself look a fool by trying to sweep Malinga&apos;s 90mph yorker. He was clean bowled. Curiously, Aleem Dar has called a no ball after Michael Clarke drove a run out to cover. No one can really fathom why he chose to deny Australia that run, but we think it was for running on the pitch. Clarke deliberately runs two yards out of his way to make a rather facetious point to the umpires after the next ball. Imagine if they lose this by a single run! Not that they will, mind. Malinga&apos;s last ball is clipped past Jayasuriya at short fine leg and runs away for four. 38th over: Australia 281-4 (Symonds 23 Clarke 8) Fernando bowls the last over of this gruesome innings. Four balls to go. As Fernando bowls yet another no ball, to go with the one wide he&apos;s already had in this over. Fernando fields a bump ball drive off his own bowling, whirls around to throw at Symonds&apos; stumps and drops the ball as he speeds past the timbers and collapses in a heap past mid-on. There is one from the last ball. And it is done. I&apos;m pretty knackered and I&apos;m also done for this World Cup. Thanks for the emails. And now it&apos;s time for a little Rob Smyth...."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/apr/30/investing.stockmarkets", "publicationDate": "2007-04-30T12:55:15Z", "tags": ["Business", "Investing", "Murray Income Trust"], "sentences": ["&quot;Korea and Taiwan might be worth a high risk punt right now but if you are going for more sophisticated investments like this you have to spend a lot of time on researching and monitoring."], "title": "Are you bold enough to take on the markets?", "article": "Widows and orphans should read no further \u2013 extreme investing is not for them. Nor is it for those of a nervous disposition, or anyone who is afraid to take a loss. &quot;Extreme investing is about spotting markets which are at the bottom and being willing to take the risk,&quot; says Adrian Shandley, managing director of Premier Wealth Management.  &quot;The more focused you are with your money \u2013 in other words the narrower the market you&apos;re putting it into \u2013 the more you may make but the more you may lose as well.&quot; The losses can be spectacular too \u2013 giving rise to some of the market&apos;s most enduring tales of fortunes won and lost. Take Nelson Bunker Hunt, for example. Once heir to America&apos;s biggest private fortune he lost it all after trying to corner the silver market between 1973 and 1979. After amassing more than 200m ounces of silver and luring other speculators into the fray, the authorities intervened, culminating in bankruptcy for Bunker Hunt and the biggest ever one day fall - now dubbed Silver Thursday. Of course, if it goes right for the extreme investor, then it goes right in spades. George Soros, for example, became a household name after making a massive bet against sterling in September 1992 which led to the British government withdrawing the pound from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday. While the event is estimated to have cost the government \u00a34bn in reserves spent attempting to prop up the pound, Soros walked away with a reputed \u00a31bn. While these are the extreme end of extreme investments, there are still plenty of high risk opportunities for investors on the look out for unconventional strategies designed to produce high-yielding results. Top of the list for today&apos;s extreme investors wanting more excitement for their money is emerging markets. This is made up of funds investing in the fast developing \u2013 or so-called Bric \u2013 countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China. For those with the appetite to take advantage of the rise of China and other emerging markets Gavin Haynes, investment director at Whitechurch Securities, says there can be exceptional returns. He said: &quot;Over the next five or 10 years these countries are going to become global economic forces and investing in emerging markets is very much a way of exploiting this change in their economic trends. &quot;It is not an investment for the faint hearted. Obviously the potential returns can be fantastic, but the clue is in the name. They remain very much emerging in terms of the politics, stock markets and their economies which can involve much greater volatility than more traditional stock market investments. &quot;In these sort of adventurous areas you should be looking at a 10-year term to smooth out the volatility to potentially get above average returns. You should certainly only invest a very small proportion of a portfolio in such areas.&quot; Specialist areas of the stock market, such as industries, regions, themes and countries, are more exciting, but they can also be volatile with the constant threat of heart-stopping fluctuations. For experienced investors who would already have well-rounded portfolios but might be ready to add high risk specific industry sector funds, technology is another extreme investment recommendation. Adrian Shandley again: &quot;Technology is a brilliant market with massive potential. It has been in the doldrums for some time, but is a really good example of something that should perform well in the next four to five years providing you pick the right fund and the right fund manager. &quot;A lot of people got their fingers burned in the big bubble in 1999/2000, everyone wanted to buy the next dot com company and technology stocks got hit very hard. Since then valuations in that sector are more reasonable \u2013 that could be something to look at for the more adventurous investor.&quot; In the specialist sector, commodities is another area which has been driven by the demand from emerging markets and the huge amounts being spent on infrastructure in areas like China and India. Funds such as Merrill Lynch&apos;s Gold &amp; General have benefited from the boom. But, while has turned out to be a fantastic area to have invested in, a big slowdown in global economic growth would hit this area hard. Some astute extreme investors manage to make money even when markets are falling by selling short. This strategy of selling shares they don&apos;t yet own in the hope the share price will fall before they have to settle the contract so they can pocket the difference, is a risky practice. For the true investment adrenaline junky, there is also spread betting. Once the preserve of City dealers, spread betting - where you gamble on the direction of shares, commodities or stock market indices \u2013 is growing in popularity among ordinary investors. City purists would however scoff that this is not strictly extreme investing, it is gambling. Even the bravest extreme investor should set up a &quot;stop-loss&quot; limit, which will close their trade at a set level if the price moves against them or the losses could be crippling. Equally risky is currency speculation. Ask 100 economists which is the strongest and in which direction currencies are heading in and you will invariably get 100 different answers It is a gamble and even Soros got it horribly wrong in the late 1990s. Day trading \u2013 buying and selling shares during the day in the hope of making a quick profit from the daily fluctuations in share prices \u2013 is also at the truly high-adrenaline end of the extreme investment game. But, although &quot;real-time&quot; internet share dealing has driven the growth in day-trading, most investors end up losing money because the dealing charges paid per trade wipe out the profits they make. The two key characteristics of an extreme investment is that it is very narrowly focused on one particular region, sector or asset class and the predictability of return is difficult. You don&apos;t know what the return is going to be and you are speculating to a large degree. But, that doesn&apos;t mean the extreme investor can give up on research \u2013 they should do their homework and lots of it. Although by nature this investor doesn&apos;t want to minimise risk they have to understand what they are going into. It is essential to check the consistency of performance of the investment \u2013 any investment can have a period of high performance in a bull market. A short period of high yields could be down to a specific market issue, or a spike in one sector. The canny extreme investor takes out the short-term success factor and looks at the investment over a three-to-five year period. &quot;Do your homework,&quot; says Mark Harris, who manages funds-of-funds for New Star Asset Management. &quot;Korea and Taiwan might be worth a high risk punt right now but if you are going for more sophisticated investments like this you have to spend a lot of time on researching and monitoring. &quot;The easiest way to tap into the potential growth in these global markets is through exchange traded funds (ETFs). They track the market like an index fund, but are shares you can buy and sell.&quot; One bar for would-be extreme investors wanting to target more exotic investments is many funds have very high minimum investments, some as much as $100,000. While most financial experts recommend that even the bravest extreme investor keeps their high-risk punts to just 5% of their portfolio, this type of investment is clearly out of the reach of most people. But, there are a number of options open to the extreme investor and if you follow the standard investing maxim that if you invest in high risk investments you receive high yields and there is a world of opportunities. It is a gamble though and if you don&apos;t do your homework you could lose more than your pride. Missed a test? Catch up here: Do you know the basics? What sort of investor are you? Do you know your markets? Are you an acronym ace?

Sam Raimi&apos;s third instalment in the superhero saga took 415 million yen (\u00a31.75m) in Japan, where it was the highest-grossing film ever to debut on a Tuesday. The film also opened in eight countries across the far east. Sony Pictures vice chairman Jeff Blake said it was &quot;bigger than Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 everywhere&quot;. If that performance is repeated here and in the US at the weekend the film could well become one of the highest grossing movies of all time in the US. 2002&apos;s Spider-Man currently stands at No 7 on that list, with $403,706,000, while 2004&apos;s Spider-Man 2 has $373,377,000 in tenth spot. The all-time record both in the US and worldwide is held by Titanic, with $600,779,000 and $1,835,300,000 respectively. However the far east box office may have been boosted by Sony&apos;s decision to play up its Japanese credentials. The studio staged the world premiere in Tokyo and brought stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst along for the ride. Spider-Man 3 certainly needs a good performance as the studio says it cost a phenomenal $258m to make. This already makes it the most expensive film of all time - beating King Kong&apos;s 2005 record of $207m, but some reports have placed that figure closer to the $500m mark. In South Korea and Hong Kong, the picture set new marks for an opening day, taking 3.2bn won (\u00a31.7m) and $HK7.5m (\u00a3480,000), respectively. Sales in Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand were the highest for any single day, opening or otherwise. Taiwan sales were the biggest for any weekday. The film, which could see Dunst and Maguire uniting with director Raimi for the final time, also opened on Tuesday in eight European markets, including Germany and France, but no figures are yet available for those countries. Spider-Man 3 opens in the UK and North America on Friday."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/02/usa.edpilkington", "publicationDate": "2007-05-02T11:20:42Z", "tags": ["World news", "US news"], "sentences": ["They cover the full gamut of glamour too, from a concrete house in Georgetown, Guyana, to a diplomatic residence in Taipei, Taiwan, with views over Yang Ming Mountain national park."], "title": "In the market for an old embassy? The Americans are selling up", "article": "The list gives a glimpse of the style to which US diplomats were once accustomed. It mentions swimming pools and tennis courts (note the plural) in Abidjan, hardwood flooring in Belize, a private elevator in Bogot\u00e1, and mature landscaping in Ottawa. Now these relics of American diplomatic riches, and much more, are up for sale, victims of the post-September 11 drive to increase security. The state department has released a portfolio of 29 properties in 21 countries that it intends to dispense with - combined asking price, more than $205m (\u00a3103m). The items range in scale from the 25,831 square feet of the US embassy annex in central London, on the market for $180m, to a 1,582 sq ft condominium for $150,000 in Santiago, Chile. They cover the full gamut of glamour too, from a concrete house in Georgetown, Guyana, to a diplomatic residence in Taipei, Taiwan, with views over Yang Ming Mountain national park. The state department&apos;s decision to sell some of its residential family silver is part of its push to improve security in its missions around the world. Alarm bells rang in 1983 with the attack on a marine corps barracks in Beirut which killed 299 US personnel. After the bombings of American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam in 1998, Congress approved $1bn towards improving the security in US outposts worldwide. But the programme was dramatically expanded in the wake of September 11. Under its bureau of overseas building operations, all diplomatic buildings have been reviewed to see if they can be renovated to give sufficient protection from suicide car bombs and missiles. Any that fail the test - often because they are too close to roads - are being sold and replaced by purpose-built compounds. Since it was formed in May 2001, the bureau has opened 42 new embassies and 40 more are under design or construction. The crown jewel in the latest list is the navy annex in Grosvenor Square, central London. Built in 1935, it was a base for Dwight Eisenhower in the second world war. Today it is a pale reflection. Estate agents Savills described it as &quot;tired old government-style offices. Reggie Perrin would feel at home there.&quot; The state department said final bids are being reviewed. It said the building was considered &quot;excess&quot;. However, the US government is known to have become increasingly annoyed in recent months by a campaign orchestrated by local residents in Mayfair against measures to tighten up security around the embassy including a programme of road closures. The state department is known to be considering leaving the entire Grosvenor Square premises and moving to a location where it can better protect itself from grumbling neighbours just as much as from potential terrorists. Several other chancery and embassy buildings are already up for sale after new premises have been erected, including a compound in Bamako, Mali, up for $2.1m; the former US ambassador&apos;s residence in Belize City located in what is described as a &quot;stable middle- to upper-class area&quot;; the complex in Managua, Nicaragua; and the embassy in Kathmandu which was acquired by America in 1964 and whose &quot;impression of a grand colonial estate&quot; helps explain its $6m asking price. In Ottawa, the international estate agents Cushman &amp; Wakefield are selling the property that has been a US residence since 1948, emphasising that it was used as the home of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward in the film Mr and Mrs Bridges. The agents also point out that the principal rooms are on a scale suited to formal entertaining. Potential buyers have to be a little cautious, though. Anyone able to afford $1.5m for the former ambassador&apos;s residence in Tripoli, Libya may be interested to know more about what the US government calls &quot;title issues&quot;. Glossing over the building&apos;s history of anti-US riots and diplomatic frostiness with the Gadafy regime, the dossier merely says that &quot;ability to convey clear title is an issue that we continue to work through with host government&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/may/04/guardianweekly.guardianweekly1", "publicationDate": "2007-05-04T11:12:27Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["She thinks it&apos;s great that I know how to say &quot;Gao za&quot; (&quot;good morning&quot; in Taiwanese).", "Although everyone speaks Mandarin, the government is promoting the use of Taiwanese as well, to help forge a Taiwanese identity distinct from mainland China.", "I often hear people switching between Mandarin and Taiwanese in one conversation."], "title": "Letter From Taiwan", "article": "Spring&apos;s here,&quot; my husband announced. &quot;The swifts are back.&quot; We don&apos;t see many birds from our 11th-floor apartment in Yonghe, a suburb of Taipei. In fact I&apos;m amazed there are any birds at all, since locals somewhat proudly claim Yonghe to be the most densely populated spot on Earth. You might think this to be negative. But living in a densely populated area has advantages. The main one is that almost anything you need is available within a short walk. Before I leave the building, Mr Wu, our security guard, asks, &quot;Are you going to work?&quot; He works 7am-7pm every day, with one day off a month. He must think I&apos;m a crazy foreigner, because three times a week I admit I&apos;m going swimming first. Working overtime, not part-time, is the norm in Taipei. Turning right out of the apartment building, I glance into the 24-hour fruit shop next door to see if I can catch the eye of the friendly shop assistants to call out &quot;Zao&quot; (&quot;early&quot; in Mandarin). About 15 steps later on the corner is the man selling freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. For the past 30 years he has sat on his little stool every day from 10am to 10pm unless it&apos;s too rainy or cold. Many Taipei-ites buy breakfast on the street, on the run, and take it to their office to eat at their desks. Sandwiches are commonly sold - but our local breakfast lady sells more traditional fare: soy milk and fan tuan, literally &quot;rice ball&quot;. She scoops out some rice from a wooden rice bucket, pats it on to a piece of plastic, tosses pieces of tofu and various pickles on top, then deftly rolls it up. She thinks it&apos;s great that I know how to say &quot;Gao za&quot; (&quot;good morning&quot; in Taiwanese). Although everyone speaks Mandarin, the government is promoting the use of Taiwanese as well, to help forge a Taiwanese identity distinct from mainland China. I often hear people switching between Mandarin and Taiwanese in one conversation. Health problems? Down the street from the market are a pharmacy, an ear, nose and throat clinic and a Chinese medicine clinic. The smells from the latter are even more pungent than those of the market. All this is takes place in about 150 square metres of Yonghe. Once you get on the subway, within an hour you can be walking in tree-covered mountains where there are lots of birds. Watch out for the swifts."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/05/terrorism.animalwelfare", "publicationDate": "2007-05-05T01:35:42Z", "tags": ["Animal welfare", "World news", "UK news", "Conservation", "Environment", "Al-Qaida", "Life and style", "Animals"], "sentences": ["But it was not until 1995 that the local authorities grasped the scale of the racket when, in the first operation of its kind in India, an entire syndicate trading in rhino horn was rolled up and found to have members in China, Taiwan and Tibet."], "title": "Islamic militants use the trade in rare wildlife to raise funds", "article": "It is so early in the morning that the cooks in the roadside dhabas along India&apos;s National Highway 37 are asleep in their kitchens, their tandoors unlit. Across the valley of Assam, in this far north-easterly corner of India, there is not a flicker of light except the feeble yellow beams from the Gypsies, the open-backed vehicles carrying small groups of tourists to the edge of one of the world&apos;s most bountiful jungles. Kaziranga - 429 sq km of forest, sandbanks and grassland - was recognised by Unesco in 1985 as a world heritage site. Tourists come in their thousands to glimpse some of the 480 species of bird, 34 kinds of mammal and 42 varieties of fish, many rare, endangered or near extinct, that inhabit this remote jungle. In recent times, however, the wildlife has attracted a new kind of visitor. According to India&apos;s security services, police, intelligence analysts, local traders and forestry officials, Islamic militants affiliated to al-Qaida are sponsoring poaching in the reserve for profit. These groups have established bases in the formerly moderate enclave of Bangladesh and have agents operating all along the country&apos;s porous 2,500-mile border with India. They have gone into business with local animal trappers and organised crime syndicates around Kaziranga - as well as in parks and reserves in Nepal, Burma and Thailand - in a quest for horns, ivory, pelts and other animal products with which to raise &quot;under the wire&quot; funds that they can move around the world invisibly. A small rhino horn, the size of a bag of sugar, with good provenance (the beast&apos;s tail and ears, presented to a prospective buyer) and in the right marketplace (in Asia, Europe or North America), can fetch \u00a320,000. Big cat pelts can go for up to \u00a310,000. Monkey brains, bear bile, musk, big cat carcasses, elephant feet, tails, horns and teeth have considerable value. A shipment worth \u00a32.8m was recently intercepted by UK customs. Profits from the trade run from $15bn to an incredible $25bn a year, according to estimates from the WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature). The punishment for trading in these items is generally a fine as low as \u00a3300 in India and \u00a3900 in Nepal. A senior Indian security source, based in the north-east, who has tracked the incursion into the trade by Bangladeshi militants, warns that the poaching has global consequences. &quot;There is an environmental disaster in the offing here, but as pressing are the security ramifications,&quot; he says. &quot;Only a minuscule percentage of the vast profits need to trickle back into a nascent Islamic insurgency in a country like Bangladesh to bring it to the boil. And then it can reach out around the world.&quot; In 2000, US president Bill Clinton commissioned &quot;a global threat assessment&quot; which concluded that the illegal trade in animal parts and endangered species was second only to drugs in the profits it could turn. That same year, the UN general assembly expressed its strong conviction that the &quot;transnational crime&quot; of trafficking in endangered species had growing links with terrorism. The WWF took up the baton and commissioned a report from Wolverhampton University that found organised crime was taking advantage of existing routes used for smuggling small arms, drugs and humans. The UK scene was a microcosm, with 50% of those prosecuted for wildlife crimes having previous convictions for serious offences including drugs and guns. That&apos;s if there is such a prosecution: ill-defined laws often prevent police making arrests. British torpor was highlighted in London in 2004, when customs intercepted a multimillion-pound ivory haul but were powerless to arrest anyone. Meanwhile, radical Islamists from Bangladesh have done what conservationists had long predicted and moved in on the endangered species racket. One has only to tour Kaziranga, or any of the outlying parks in Assam or Nepal, to understand why. Dawn breaks as our convoy of Gypsies reaches the park. The rangers whisper urgently, &quot;Gorh&quot;, the local word for rhinoceros. Metres away, eight rhino are lumbering through the rich alluvial mud, showing off their prized uni-horn. There are more than 2,000 of these short-sighted beasts here, making up three-quarters of the global stock of one of the rarest pachyderms in the world. Beside them are scores of swamp deer coloured like the scrub. A group of wild buffalo, whose colossal horns have the span of a longboat oar, plod by, as does a troop of elephants, their tusks glinting in the purple dawn. Somewhere in the long grass, which rises in clumps like a castle keep, are more Royal Bengal tigers per square kilometre than in any other stretch of jungle in the world - broken down into their constituent parts, each is worth as much as a bespoke Italian racing car. The gangs hired to trap and kill in Kaziranga are said by forestry staff to camp on the vast sand bars created by the flow of the Brahmaputra river. The river here is at least a kilometre wide and we haggle with a man paddling a wooden canoe to take us across. But as soon as it dawns on him where we intend to go, he backs out of the deal. &quot;I will not go there,&quot; he says. &quot;The people who live there will skin me alive.&quot; He offers to rent us his boat instead, and with our driver, a migrant from the impoverished state of Bihar, we launch ourselves into the water. The nearest sand bar is clearly visible, but so vicious are the currents that it takes two hours to reach it. As we near, people who look more like Saharan Touaregs than Assamese run towards the shore, waving hunting rifles. Trapped in a swirling eddy, we can&apos;t decide what to do. From the sand bar, they pelt the canoe with stones. The Bihari driver, who understands what they&apos;re saying, starts screaming. The canoe pitches and rolls as we try to calm him. He takes a deep breath and addresses the angry crowd: &quot;These are only here for talking. Please... These bring gifts. Not the police.&quot; We hold up baskets of fruit, bags of nuts and sweets. The sand bar dwellers lower their weapons and motion us ashore. We climb the bank and at the crest of the dune see there are hundreds of them, living in an improvised encampment. We want to know about life on the sand bar, we say, passing round the food. They shrug, munching. One man offers: &quot;We are people who have few rights.&quot; Another agrees: &quot;We are poor and we do what we can.&quot; Does that include poaching? Has anyone trapped animals from Kaziranga? Now everyone is eating and nearly all the hands shoot into the air. One man says, &quot;We are for hire. We can trap and shoot, but when the summer rain comes, the river breaks its banks and the animals float to us.&quot; Another adds, &quot;We patrol the park&apos;s border, too; when the animals wander out, we are there.&quot; He pulls from his pocket an unidentifiable animal claw. These sand bar dwellers at the start of the tangled enterprise know far more about the intricacies of the business than the authorities told us they would. They draw trafficking routes in the sand, explaining how the trade is coordinated by agents across Assam. A villager places stones on the sand-map to mark the towns. &quot;Golaghat, Tezpur, Kamrup, Nagaon, these are the main places for agents.&quot; They answer to a boss based in Dimapur, one of the richest cities in the neighbouring state of Nagaland, with a highway that runs into Burma and rail links to New Delhi and Calcutta . &quot;But everything tends to collect and move through Siliguri,&quot; a villager says, identifying a chaotic city in West Bengal which is also a springboard into the Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal and Bhutan. What do they poach? &quot;Whatever we can and whatever we are asked for.&quot; The money is in rhino horn and elephant tusks, the latter taking advantage of a black hole in the forestry department&apos;s record-keeping. While the rhino population remains closely monitored, no accurate records are kept for elephants. The forestry department estimates that 170 were poached over a six-year period, but the sand bar people claim a figure almost double that. From whom do they take orders? The villagers look stony-faced. They talk among themselves. &quot;The Tibetans and Chinese are big men in this,&quot; says one, &quot;but we are all from Bangladesh. Bangladeshis dominate the network now.&quot; Are they talking only about those living in India, or about orders coming from over the border, too? They shrug and mumble, clearly distressed. We should talk to an agent they name in a nearby city. They cannot tell us any more. In nearby Tezpur, the wildlife trade agent turns out to be a rich local jeweller, but he is tight-lipped and refers us to his boss in another town. This boss, who runs a local hotel, says he can&apos;t talk without clearance from the bhai, the big boss in Siliguri. After 10 hours on the broken highway, we find his modest house in a chaotic suburb. Over plates of daal-fry, bread and curd, he tells us he is a haulier, shipping freight over the border with Bangladesh, but also &quot;a man of many hats. One hat, you could say, is in animals. I move a lot of everything: elephant ivory, cat skins, musk deer, bear gall bladders, rhino horn, live leopard cubs that are sent to Nepal, Burma and then into Thailand. The prices we pay are so low, the profit margins are healthy.&quot; He opens both arms expansively, as if demonstrating the size of a fish. &quot;We can get a snow leopard pelt for $1,000 and sell it for 10 times that. Ivory can be bought for as little as $200 a kilo and sold for 100 times this.&quot; He munches on a red onion as a glass of milk poured straight from a churn froths in front of him on the table. How did he get involved? The wildlife trade in the town took off in 1983, he says, when old trafficking networks in Calcutta were effectively shut down by the police. The Siliguri police confirm that soon after this, a stash of horns was discovered, tipping them off to the town&apos;s new business. But it was not until 1995 that the local authorities grasped the scale of the racket when, in the first operation of its kind in India, an entire syndicate trading in rhino horn was rolled up and found to have members in China, Taiwan and Tibet. &quot;But these police successes were few and far between,&quot; claims the haulier, showing us his gleaming new trucks and his home - the first in town to have a flat-screen TV, now with one in every room. He is happy to talk, and calls colleagues to confirm his stories. Eventually we ask who&apos;s behind the Bangladeshi business. &quot;Where, not who,&quot; he says and points to Bangladesh. &quot;Religious men hold the purse strings now. The business has changed. Their agents came to see us. They want a low-risk business.&quot; A trader from Siliguri with betel-red teeth tells the same story. &quot;This was a Chinese business but now it&apos;s Bangladesh&apos;s business. It&apos;s become God&apos;s work,&quot; he says, raising an eyebrow. &quot;And, as you know, the Prophet, peace be upon his head, is irresistible.&quot; It all began two years ago. Says the haulier,&quot;A friend in common at a local mosque [in West Bengal] passed me a message saying representatives working for two militia groups in Bangladesh wanted a meet in a madrassah [seminary] in Siliguri.&quot; A trader with an import-export company near to the India-Bangladesh border explains: &quot;They came to us because we are the same as them,&quot; he says. &quot;The hauliers and money men behind the wildlife trade are of Bangladeshi origin. The poachers, too. All of us can move freely over the border. We look right. Talk the same. They wanted in. Small, valuable commodities - horn, teeth, pelts - fetch incredible prices and are easy to conceal among legitimate export goods. Also, something truly valuable can be used to borrow against, to secure a line of credit.&quot; The traditional methods by which anyone wishing to raise and transport money invisibly were through nominal charities, the gold market and the global unofficial banking system known as hawala. But these were heavily disrupted after September 11 2001, the traders say. New channels were needed. Three of those who claimed to have been at the meeting two years ago say they knew exactly whom the agents worked for in Bangladesh: Al Mujahideen, an obscure jihadist umbrella organisation governing a panoply of militant groups that have sprung up in Bangladesh in recent years. Two in particular, both banned by the Bangladeshi government, were in need of money and eager to get into the racket, said Siliguri traders. One was Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), allegedly linked to al-Qaida; the second was Jama&apos;atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), whose leader, Shaikh Abdur Rahman, had joined Bin Laden&apos;s World Islamic Front for the Jihad Against the Jews and the Crusaders in 1998. He was captured in Bangladesh and in March was hanged for the killing of two Bangladeshi judges and for nationwide bombings in 2005. A 147 million-strong, predominantly Muslim state, Bangladesh was once renowned for its religious and ethnic tolerance. Then, six years ago, Jamaat-e-Islami, a radical Islamic party, was elected as a coalition partner in the ruling government. Extremists, especially the HuJI and JMB, have already been accused of a string of terrorist attacks. In June 2001, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was injured when an explosion killed 20 and injured 300 at a rally in Dhaka. On May 21 2004, Anwar Choudhury, the British ambassador to Bangladesh, was targeted in a bomb blast that claimed the lives of three others, including his bodyguard. In January 2005, the former finance minister and four other opposition activists were killed and 70 people injured when a grenade was thrown during a meeting in the north. Some graduates from terrorist training camps run by the HuJI were recently arrested, suspected of plotting a coordinated wave of 459 explosions that detonated across Bangladesh on August 17 2005. There is already an international dimension, too. After the fall of Kabul in 2001, in a now notorious incident, the MV Mecca, a boat loaded with 150 Taliban and al-Qaida cadres, was said by Bangladeshi intelligence sources to have anchored off the country&apos;s Chittagong port, where small boats ferried them ashore. The Indonesian authorities raised concerns about the direction Bangladesh was taking after interrogating &quot;Hambali&quot;, the leader of Indonesia&apos;s militant Jemaah Islamiya group, who was arrested in Thailand in connection with the Bali bombings in August 2002. Hambali, currently in US custody at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, allegedly admitted having made plans to shift part of his organisation to Bangladesh as life got more difficult at home. Earlier this year India said it had intelligence connecting Bangladeshi militant groups with some of those behind the Mumbai train blasts of July 11 2006, in which more than 100 people died and 700 were injured. India also claims that on January 4 this year, two Bangladeshi nationals, who admitted belonging to HuJI, were arrested in New Delhi carrying 1.42kg of explosives, four electronic detonators and two hand grenades thought intended for the Republic Day celebrations. The Indian security services officer we interviewed says, &quot;There has been a significant migration from Bangladesh, with tens of millions fleeing to expatriate communities abroad. Poverty has helped radicalise them and we have put to your government our concern that the increasingly ambitious militant groups in Bangladesh are aiming to incite the exiles and so broaden the jihad - as Pakistani groups did in Britain.&quot; This warning was echoed by Bruce Riedel, a former director on Clinton&apos;s National Security Council, at a conference in the US in February. &quot;After September 11,&quot; he said, &quot;al-Qaida determined it would be increasingly difficult to bring Arab or South Asian operatives into the [West] on Arab or South Asian passports. They needed to look for a new mechanism in order to move operatives around. They found it, for example, in the large Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in the United Kingdom. Those communities turned out to have a significant, albeit small, minority of radicals who could be encouraged to perform al-Qaida&apos;s dirty work for it. Since those people had as a birthright a British passport, they had relatively easy access into the UK and out, and into the US and back into Pakistan.&quot; In Kaziranga, an anti-poaching patrol prepares to leave: 16 men, nine carbines, rope, machetes, plastic sheeting - and eight elephants. Only elephants are capable of navigating the sodden terrain. As we move forward, the canopy overhead thickens. There is a micro-climate beneath the tree tops; a humid mizzle generated by the perspiring vegetation folds around us. Clouds of pinprick flies swarm, irritating everything they touch. Creepers with blood-red scales snag skin and clothing; high above our heads, amid a bouquet of jungle orchids, red spiders have trapped a nectar-hunting bird. No one lingers too long. Small mistakes here have grave results. Fall over and the soupy air prevents a scab forming; toxic spores blossom in an open wound. None of us dares drop litter or personal possessions, not just because the jungle is pristine but because we do not want to leave a trail for predators. By five it is dark. We have seen nothing suspicious, but the thick vegetation obscures everything. There is a strange drumming in the mud up ahead. It sounds like digging. The branches crackle. No tour parties are allowed this far in. Anyone we encounter will have to shoot their way out because they know the park rangers will fire on them first. The elephants rip into the undergrowth, the rangers raise their rifles. We reach the banks of a vast lagoon and catch sight of something skimming away from us. It might be a canoe, or an animal. The rangers mutter. They fear it is poachers. One lets loose a shot out of frustration. Timid wildfowl tear out of the undergrowth, shrieking, setting off the bar-headed geese, which clatter and flap over the water. A lame Chinook clips the trees, shaking up a colony of ring-tailed macaques; they go off like car alarms. Osprey, kites and fish eagles. Wigeons, pigeons, shovellers and barbets. Shrikes, thrushes and bronzed drongos. Names of birds, inelegant and bizarre, are whispered by the mahouts, who identify everything they see as if constantly making an inventory of the jungle that is now at screaming pitch. A radio crackles. It is the rangers&apos; HQ calling. Miles away, with the electricity supply cut again, the duty officer huddles by a loudspeaker powered by a car battery. Next door, Central Range chief Dharanidhar Boro sits at his table, a bowl of rice in front of him. He is one of the most vigorous of the park&apos;s rangers charged with disrupting the poaching. But he is exhausted. Boro is an awkward man. He does not drink or get stoned when all around him do. He believes in straight talking. &quot;We cannot stop but it is difficult sometimes to go on. We are up against it. This is hard, hard work. We have to be merciless. This is a war for survival.&quot; He pulls from a cabinet a photo album. On the first page is a picture of a corpse splattered by shotgun fire. &quot;I killed this man as he prepared to stake out a rhino.&quot; He turns the pages and points to another corpse, its entrails dangling like ship&apos;s bunting. &quot;I killed this one, too, as he sawed at a rhino&apos;s horn.&quot; There are scores more photographs picturing the dead laid out like mackerel. We ask him about the new jihadi component in the trade. &quot;We hear things but we have no hard facts. The rhino horns are used to buy guns and bombs, we are told. The guys we catch, what can they tell us? The colour of the shirt worn by the guy who paid them off.&quot; In December, Boro&apos;s men tracked a gang of poachers to their tents. They had fled but left behind a new, modern tranquilliser gun and darts. &quot;They used to shoot at rhinos, but the crack of the bullet is a problem as it carries far and we will hear. Some place poison. Others pull down power lines and try to electrocute the animals. However, recently they have come here with silencers. We are finding increasingly sophisticated weapons.&quot; The poaching figures for Kaziranga were stark until very recently. As many as 48 rhinos a year were being killed for their horn, a figure comparable to about 2% of the total population in Assam. The state is classified as a &quot;disturbed area&quot;, with a stubborn and often bloody secessionist movement desperate to break free from New Delhi. Militants have been fighting for 27 years and 10,000 lives have been lost. Recently, as peace talks began, there was a lull, then an insurgency blew up in Nepal. Boro says, &quot;Through better organisation among the rangers and better stability in Assam, the gangs laid off us and started attacking Nepal, which also has rhino.&quot; Then he adds dourly, &quot;We cannot count on peace.&quot; Shortly before we arrived in Assam in February, seven Hindi-speaking labourers were shot dead at one of the state&apos;s brick kilns. A railway bridge was blown up, just missing a crowded train. Masked gunmen attacked six labourers&apos; colonies in the northern districts of Dibrugarh and Tinsukia, killing 48 Indian settlers. Another eight people, including police officers, died when their vehicle hit a roadside mine in the central Karbi Anglong district. It was the state&apos;s worst violence in a decade, all the killings perpetrated by the United Liberation Front of Assam. An indefinite curfew was imposed while the Indian security forces combed the jungle for rebel camps and forest rangers hid themselves among the trees, waiting, resignedly, for the opportunists to arrive. Whether it&apos;s an independence struggle in Assam or an al-Qaida terror campaign, the outlook is perilous for the wildlife of Kaziranga."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/may/05/asusteksclassm", "publicationDate": "2007-05-05T11:05:04Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Computing", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Asustek -- which makes some notebooks for Dell and 13.3 inch MacBooks for Apple -- plans to start manufacturing own-brand notebook PCs with prices starting at $249 or less."], "title": "Asustek's Classmate could challenge MIT's laptop", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s Asustek -- which makes some notebooks for Dell and 13.3 inch MacBooks for Apple -- plans to start manufacturing own-brand notebook PCs with prices starting at $249 or less.

Asustek is planning four designs based on Intel&apos;s Classmate PC prototype (see below), at prices from $249 to $549, according to company vice president Jerry Shen. He reckons sales could reach 10 million units next year. The story was reported in the Chinese-language Commercial Times, then picked up by the English-language Digitimes and Ars Technica. However, an earlier story, published by Digitimes on April 16, said there would be five Classmate-based notebooks with prices starting at $199. Ars Technica previously published A comparison of OLPC&apos;s XO laptop and Intel&apos;s Classmate PC. It says:    Both the XO laptop and the Classmate PC provide unique advantages that are worthy of consideration. With a more powerful processor, more memory, and support for unmodified Windows and Linux software, the Classmate PC provides schools with more choices and greater flexibility. OLPC&apos;s XO laptop offers a better price, a more cohesive and well-integrated software platform, and special features like a built-in video camera, high-resolution dual-mode screen, longer battery life, and pull-string charging.    Governments adopting the Classmate PC could go with Edubuntu or take the Microsoft deal that offers Windows and Office for $3, or both. At the moment, Windows has close to 100% of the third world market because of the ease with which cheap machines can be assembled locally, and the ready availability of pirate software, including games. Non-standard designs such as AMD&apos;s PIC (Personal Internet Communicator) have fared poorly. The OLPC even uses what is basically the same chip as the PIC: the Cyrix Geode.

The site recommends music based on what you like: enter &quot;Tom Waits&quot; and its database of (at least) 6 billion pieces of information gathered from its users will suggest that you probably also like Nick Drake and Lou Reed. You can download their desktop app and it will create your own personalised radio station based on what you listen to, and what it thinks you&apos;ll like. The different here is that Last.fm&apos;s recommendations are based on the listening habits of its users, rather than what some wonky-haired, tight be-jeaned muso thinks you&apos;d like. Anyway, the same process is being applied to video, so users get music videos as well as songs. Videos will be better quality than YouTube and will initially focus on the indie labels: Ninja Tune, Warp, Atlantic, Mute, Domino and Nettwerk Music Group. The rather modest ambition is to get the site to include every music video ever, to o be the MTV of the internet (Viacom will love that - not) and to tap the &quot;long tail&quot; for music videos. MTV currently rotates the same 2,000, co-founder Martin Stiksel told Wired, but I swear when you watch it it feels more like 20. Last.fm&apos;s Christian Ward said the first videos would probably be on the site next week, and the recommendation around the videos would be added later. For now, the priority is to attract as much high-quality video as possible. And there&apos;s plenty more tricks coming from these guys. (Release) Kevin Rose&apos;s new baby Digg&apos;s Kevin Rose, perhaps unsettled by last week&apos;s user revolt over HD encryption codes (sexier than it sounds, honest) is trotting out his third start-up project which has something to do with an IM-style communications tool. It&apos;s all very secret squirrel at the moment, says Om Malik, kind of, but should launch later this month. Rose is working with fellow Digger Daniel Burka and entrepreneur Leah Culver - I&apos;m guessing that&apos;s her of the etched-laptop fame. Kevin will probably still be working on Digg and also Revision 3, and both of those were funded by Greylock Partners. (GigaOm) Postcodes in news story tags Archant is asking its regional newspaper reporters to put the relevant postcodes as tags on stories so that it can serve hyper-local news to its online readers. It sounds very much like there is some Holovaty-esque Chicago crime-style Google Mappage on the cards too: development director Ian Davies said this will allow new types of reporting because &apos;the newsroom will be able to refer back to all the crimes that have been reported on one particular street&apos;. The revamped localised sites will launch in August or September, starting with the Norwich Evening News. (Press Gazette) Google Mappage In other Google news, they just launched a new blog dedicated to the geo-web, which indicates the level of &quot;buzz&quot; (as the kids say) about this trend. It&apos;s the LatLongBlog. And there&apos;s now a UK version of Google Maps for Mobile (thank God), which might cut down the number of Londoners trotting round the capital with maps printed on A4. (Vecosys) Just to elaborate on the continuing fascination with perks for Google employees, Reuters has done a smidge on a mobile hairdresser in the car park, or something. Such is the fear of infiltration that the snippers, Onsite Haircuts, have been made to sign nondisclosure agreements. So we were able to find out which whether it was Sergey or Larry that had expressed an interest in getting his barnet done in the car park. Shame.

This round of funding values the site at \u00a335m. VideoJug focuses on how-to videos and makes money through display ads, content syndication and producing corporate videos.

Cinema Paradiso Giuseppe Tornatore, Italy/France, 1988 Our verdict: O Guardian readers, I love you and perhaps sometimes (as a Guardian reader for 50 years) I come close to understanding you. But Cinema Paradiso as the best foreign language film of all time? Better than M, The Rules of the Game, Ugetsu Monogatari or ... Maybe I&apos;m a snob, and I know we&apos;re playing a game, not voting for president. But can&apos;t you see that this is the kind of movie lousy presidents remember when they want to be kind to cinema and show their humanity? The film is clever and touching, and in its way it&apos;s an ad for cinema. But ... there is work to be done. David Thomson 2. Am\u00e9lie Jean-Pierre Jeunet, France/Germany, 2001 Our verdict: Forget La R\u00e8gle du Jeu; forget L&apos;Atalante; forget Abel Gance&apos;s Napoleon; if there&apos;s a single film that defines France in the eyes of the Guardian readership, it&apos;s this hyperactive magical-realist tale from the Gallic answer to Tim Burton, Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Its self-consciously cutie-pie tone has meant that, even before its release, it was thoroughly scorned by the People Who Count (ie, the Cannes film festival). The fact that it&apos;s cleaned up in country after country (\u00a34.32m at the UK box office at the last time of asking) shows that, approve of it or not, Amelie has got something. As footballers are fond of saying, you can only beat what&apos;s put in front of you, and Am\u00e9lie has done that for years. Andrew Pulver 3. Seven Samurai Akira Kurosawa, Japan, 1954 Our verdict: This is still the best mixture of the western and an authentic samurai film, in which seven noble and skilled fighters (beautifully delineated) decide to defend a farming village against marauding bandits. Kurosawa orders the action in waves and the weather deteriorates (so you need to see the long version). Today, perhaps, the ending begs for a touch more irony (as villagers might turn on their heroes), but this set international standards for action cinema, the slow-mo grandeur of combat and the general infiltration of Japanese &quot;stoicism&quot; into the age of tight-lipped Clint Eastwood heroes. DT 4. City of God Fernando Meirelles, Brazil/France/USA, 2002 Our verdict: There are plenty of ways to read City of God&apos;s fourth place in this poll - first, that young people are voting and seeking a true vision of the world from the movies; second, that that hope has extended to Latin America and the slums of Rio, where Fernando Mereilles&apos; picture is set; and third, that young moviegoers use the movies as a way of focusing their anger or despair about the unfairness of the world. All the above could have been said about Luis Bu\u00f1uel&apos;s Los Olvidados, made in 1950, and a better film. But Los Olvidados never woke the world up as City of God did. DT 5. The Battle of Algiers Gillo Pontecorvo, Algeria/ Italy, 1966 Our verdict: You could argue that no modern movie has had more political influence. For the tension in this dramatised documentary has been employed in the training and the inspiration of real-life terrorists opposed to occupying forces. Pontecorvo used people who had known the real war in Algeria - from all sides - and you can tell yourself you are seeing the &quot;true&quot; face of outrage. But, in fact, the picture is artfully made in a black-and-white that apparently appeals to Guardian readers a lot. Above all, this reminds us that &quot;real&quot; coverage of terrible events is itself a political weapon. DT 6. Breathless Jean-Luc Godard, France, 1960 Our verdict: This is one of the turning points in film history, modernism made for peanuts, with a strange American starlet (Jean Seberg) talking away to a French Humphrey Bogart (Jean-Paul Belmondo) as Godard experimented with ways of interfering with his own story. It was the start of the first period of Godard&apos;s work, and if you are thrilled by it, I urge you to pursue richer and more emotional films (such as Vivre Sa Vie, Contempt and Pierrot le Fou). But Godard in the 60s is still radical, funny and captivated by his medium in ways that make later modernists seem lazy. DT 7. Jean de Florette/ Manon des Sources Claude Berri, France/Switzerland/Italy, 1986 Our verdict: If any single event triggered the British exodus to Provence, the Dordogne and southern France, it was the release of the first part of this picturesque double-bill in 1986 - a good few years before Peter Mayle got going. Issuing from G\u00e9rard Depardieu&apos;s glory years and adapted from Marcel Pagnol&apos;s novel L&apos;Eau des Collines, it exudes a certain kind of rural Frenchness that has as become as exportable, in its way, as Richard Curtis&apos;s England. Its enduring hold on the Anglo-Saxon imagination is not something, I suspect, the French will be wild about. AP 8. Bicycle Thieves Vittorio De Sica, Italy, 1948 Our verdict: It&apos;s fascinating that this classic of the Italian neo-realist movement holds its power more than 50 years after it was made. A man needs a job desperately - putting up movie posters of Rita Hayworth. For the job he needs a bike. But in an impoverished city, the bike is stolen. With his son, he goes on a great search in a city of bicycles. De Sica judges the pathos very well, though as a rule he advanced on scenes where children taught adults about life. Hollywood wanted a remake (with Cary Grant), and in that crazed urge you can feel the end of Hollywood coming. DT 9. Pan&apos;s Labyrinth Guillermo del Toro, Mexico/Spain/USA, 2006 Our verdict: Del Toro placed himself at the vanguard of Latin-American film talent with his exotic Oscar-winning fairytale set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. On its release last year, the critic Mark Kermode hailed it as &quot;the Citizen Kane of fantasy cinema&quot;. If that sounds a bit rich, you should sample the film itself - a dark gateau layered with true-life monsters (that fascist colonel) and fantastical freaks (the terrifying pale man), and iced with imagery lifted from Goya and Arthur Rackham. All told, it&apos;s quite a treat. Xan Brooks 10. In the Mood for Love Wong Kar Wai, Hong Kong/France, 2000 Our verdict: &quot;Everyone&quot; knows now: Asia makes the most interesting films, and most of them come from South Korea and Hong Kong. Wong Kar Wai&apos;s great romance is set in the latter in the 60s. It is a strange, secret love story between two people who try to rent the same apartment, starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung. What sets this above so many other Asian films is the stylistic intricacy, the ambiguous relationship of story and politics, and the subtle implication that it&apos;s a film about everything. Hollywood, in that sense, now exists in the Far East - and we are far away. DT 11. Tokyo Story Yasujiro Ozu, Japan, 1953 Our verdict: What a great pleasure to see Guardian readers voting for this masterpiece by Ozu (though I&apos;d like to remind them that the greatest of Japanese directors is still Kenji Mizoguchi). Ozu developed a simple, withdrawn camera style perfect for the observation of different members of a family. As always, this is about concession, compromise and the way the passage of time first reveals and then helps us pass over the unfairnesses in life. After this, there are only about another 20 Ozu films worth seeing! DT 12. Les Enfants du Paradis Marcel Carn\u00e9, France, 1945 Our verdict: This is a tribute to the romantic energy of 19th-century French theatre - and to the same champagne excitement as Paris recovered from German occupation in 1944-45. Carn\u00e9 set it up as the Germans were still in town, but the film opened in a free city and it is as much of a patriotic endorsement as Olivier&apos;s Henry V. But, written by Jacques Pr\u00e9vert and designed by Alexandre Trauner, it is a masterpiece of studio film-making. Still hugely enjoyable and a treasure house of great performances from Arletty to Barrault. DT 13. The Seventh Seal Ingmar Bergman, Sweden, 1957 Our verdict: One of those films not subject to the vagaries of fashion or marketing, Bergman&apos;s breakthrough hit remains arguably the most unforgiving, cold, user-hostile entry on the list. That resonant opening scene, with medieval knight Max von Sydow taking on Death at chess, has become a much-parodied classic - Bill and Ted beating Death at Battleships springs to mind - but take the trouble to look again, and you find a stark crystallisation of Bergman&apos;s key themes: faith, despair and the silence of God. From a time before merchandising and date-movies weren&apos;t prime considerations, this is one to be cherished. AP 14. Jules and Jim Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, France, 1962 Our verdict: In so many ways, this is the ideal &quot;new wave&quot; film - it&apos;s set in period (the first world war) and yet it&apos;s a new version of sexual politics in which one impulsive, dangerous and utterly seductive woman can keep two men (at least) in her life. So it was rich material in an age of new promiscuity. It has fabulous black-and-white widescreen (by Raoul Coutard) and a classic score by Georges Delerue. But, above all, it has Jeanne Moreau, one of the true and unstoppable &quot;beasts&quot; of cinema, devouring or changing everything she sees. DT 15. La Haine Mathieu Kassovitz, France, 1995 Our verdict: In the wake of the French election, the troubles of the banlieues have come in for one of their periodic bout of attention, but it was this agonised shout from the wrong side of the chemin de fer that first alerted the wider world to a nasty underside of the shiny Gallic dream. Taking his cue from Boyz n the Hood, then-unknown actor Kassovitz cast another barely-known actor, his friend Vincent Cassel, as a gun-toting hoodlum driven bananas by racism and petty crime; it&apos;s clearly still got something to say. AP 16. Il Postino Michael Radford, France/Italy/Belgium, 1994 Our verdict: Is Postino is better than Antonioni&apos;s La Notte? Than Rossellini&apos;s Open City? Than Bertolucci&apos;s The Conformist? Than 20, 30, 40 other Italian films? Why is it that Italy is connected with this sweet air of aberration? Is it that we want to live in Italy? Is it that such films as Il Postino awaken the tourist in us? Have we turned story, drama and characters into the sites of travelogue? I am serious - I think that Il Postino is not really a movie, but a kind of animated magazine section on the idyll of a certain kind of Italian life. The great interest of this is that it shows fantasy - the engine of the movies - still thriving. DT 17. Oldboy Chan-wook Park, South Korea, 2003 Our verdict: This is a terrific Korean action film that unfolds the story content of about five lumbering US films in a bare two hours. Director Chan-wook Park never lets us settle. It begins as a bad dream, moves to a 15-year prison sentence and then explodes in flashbacks that trace the real crime. In addition, it has a fantastic taste for eating and eateries, and an overall confidence that the films noirs made by RKO 60 years ago may be the most lively model for movies that explore the thriving prosperity and moral chaos of south-east Asia - and which leave us in little doubt that this is our future. DT 18. Delicatessen Marc Caro &amp; Jean-Pierre Jeunet, France, 1991 Our verdict: Delicatessen has lost none of its freshness in the years since it was first sprung on an unsuspecting public. It&apos;s a mad, Heath Robinson-esque assemblage: part comedy, part love story, part cyberpunk comic-strip, with its decaying tenement home to all manner of roguish inhabitants (sad-faced clowns, cannibalistic butchers, lentil-eating guerrillas et al). Forget trying to make sense of the plot. It&apos;s just a peg on which to drape the wacky misadventures and fiendishly choreographed set-pieces. Co-director Jean-Pierre Jeunet went on to further success with Alien: Resurrection and the winsome Am\u00e9lie, but he&apos;s never equalled this bizarre and brilliant one-off. XB 19. La Dolce Vita Federico Fellini, Italy/France, 1960 Our verdict: Few films have their cake and eat it with quite the confidence - and abandon - of Fellini&apos;s classic. A freewheeling tour of the Rome party circuit, this lambasted the tawdry lifestyle of its modish characters while simultaneously luxuriating in it. Along the way, it coined the term &quot;paparazzo&quot; and rustled up a crop of indelible, iconic images. Nowadays we remember the famous shot of Anita Ekberg in the fountain far more than we recall that allegorical image of Christ being forcibly lifted out of the city. If that&apos;s not what Fellini would have wanted, one fears he has only himself to blame. XB 20. The 400 Blows Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, France, 1959 Our verdict: This was Truffaut&apos;s first feature film, and it introduced Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud as a version of Truffaut himself, leading a rough, tough life, and barely avoiding juvenile delinquency on the way to the great sea called cinema. I love its unsentimental view of childhood, its adoration of a Paris seen in black and white (thank you for voting so often for b/w) and the naturalness of L\u00e9aud. Truffaut would lose his touch later in life, I fear, and he started to make foolish pictures. But for a few years in the 60s, the sight and sound of his work (there&apos;s another great score by Jean Constantin) is enough to remind us all that cinema can be heavenly.

Net curtains twitched. Shoppers tutted. The holidaymaker had advanced a mere 50 yards down Modbury high street before Helen Pickles burst out of her shop looking askance. &quot;Madam,&quot; the joint proprietor of R&amp;H Pickles hardware trilled at Mrs Beard, &quot;is that a plastic bag you&apos;re carrying?&quot; Two weeks after becoming the first town in Europe to ban plastic bags from its shops, an extraordinary transformation has taken place in the south Devon community. Carrying a plastic bag has become antisocial behaviour. Wicker baskets, rucksacks and reusable bags of every shape and size swing from the arms of shoppers in the bustling town of 1,500 people. But if you&apos;re spotted with a plastic one you risk becoming a social pariah. &quot;I had to rescue one lady because she was walking down the road with a plastic bag and her friends were saying &apos;you can&apos;t be seen in Modbury with a plastic bag&apos;,&quot; said Rebecca Hosking, 33, a wildlife camerawoman who came up with the idea in a local pub one evening. &quot;I ran out of my flat and said, &apos;it&apos;s OK, she&apos;s reusing it, she&apos;s allowed to bring it into the town&apos;.&quot; From the butchers to the Co-op supermarket, none of the town&apos;s 43 traders uses plastic bags. The 2,000 special edition Modbury bags made from fair trade recycled cotton are already a collectors&apos; item; stores also sell 5p biodegradable cornstarch bags, biodegradable bin bags and even biodegradable bags for dog mess. There is one plastic bag left in town and it is so rare it has a name - &quot;the granny&apos;s knickers&quot; - and has become the subject of earnest debate as it hangs from an oak tree by the car park. It won&apos;t foil the residents for long. Modburians have a talent for environmental problem solving. Unlike fashionable Totnes nearby, Modbury is not a beacon for alternative lifestyles. &quot;It&apos;s a horsy, farmy town that&apos;s always been very conservative,&quot; said Ms Hosking. &quot;If we&apos;ve done it, it proves you don&apos;t have to be one of those &apos;green&apos; towns to change over.&quot; Their plastic bag ban was not the result of years of campaigning. Ms Hosking suggested it in the pub one evening in March shortly after filming a BBC documentary about the devastating effect of plastic bags on marine life in Hawaii. She showed the film to the town&apos;s traders. Four weeks of sleepless nights researching viable alternatives followed and plastic bag-free status began on May 1. Since then, she has fielded thousands of calls from shoppers and traders across the world wanting to follow Modbury&apos;s lead. More than 60 towns in the UK, including 15 in Devon and Cornwall, have approached her for help. International media has swarmed there; several celebrities desperate to &quot;endorse&quot; Modbury&apos;s action have been politely rebuffed. Ms Hosking says she sometimes feels like Brian from Monty Python&apos;s Life of Brian. There is certainly a messianic glint in proud locals&apos; eyes when they talk about the ban. &quot;It&apos;s fabulous,&quot; said Anne Tillett, wielding a flowery blue bag. &quot;I popped into a supermarket in another town yesterday and because I hadn&apos;t planned ahead I didn&apos;t have my bag and I just couldn&apos;t take a plastic bag. I&apos;ve become a missionary.&quot; Adam Searle used to hand out 200 plastic bags every day. His deli is busier than ever but he barely uses two cornstarch bags a day. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll get through my biodegradable bags before they biodegrade,&quot; he said. &quot;You have a couple of awkward people who go &apos;it&apos;s a load of rubbish&apos; and you explain what it&apos;s about and they pat you on the back.&quot; It is impossible to find a cynic or contrarian even among outsiders. Holidaymakers Terry and Gill Lodge were oblivious to the revolution in Modbury until they went shopping. They didn&apos;t bat an eyelid about buying a reusable bag. &quot;Bloody marvellous,&quot; said Mr Lodge. &quot;In Salisbury we always shop in Waitrose and their plastic bags are so flimsy that you put them in the boot of your car and they fall to pieces. Not satisfactory at all.&quot; &quot;The sooner we get rid of plastic bags and packaging the better,&quot; added Mrs Lodge. Ms Hosking could easily make her fortune as a plastic bag guru but wants to get back to her day job - filming buzzards. Towns that keep asking her for &quot;a manual&quot; on how to do it need to look closer to home. &quot;It has to come from residents and from the community,&quot; she said. Billed as a six-month experiment, townsfolk are adamant there will be no turning back. It received no funding or council intervention but Modbury was helped by its preponderance of independent traders. Only the Co-op supermarket was part of a chain and it has been an enthusiastic supporter. But Ms Hosking reckons it is still possible for towns with big chain stores. &quot;The supermarkets have two options - they can come with you and all the town looks good or they look bad when the whole town bans bags and they don&apos;t.&quot; Back on the high street, Mrs Beard and her friend, Rose Rogers, were expecting that tap on the shoulder. &quot;Before we went on holiday, my son said &apos;plastic bags are banned in Modbury. Mind you don&apos;t get arrested walking down the street with one&apos;,&quot; said Mrs Rogers. But Mrs Beard was not offended by her interrogation. &quot;My plastic bag is recycled,&quot; she said. &quot;I always carry one around in my handbag.&quot; Cutting down \u00b7 17bn plastic bags a year are given to British consumers. The average Briton accepts five a week. \u00b7 Anya Hindmarch launched the limited edition \u00a35 I&apos;m Not A Plastic Bag this year. It has been criticised by some because it was made in China, but Hindmarch said they were careful to carbon offset the project and the intent was not to make a profit but &quot;cast a spotlight on the issue&quot;. \u00b7 Taiwan is prohibiting not only plastic bags, but also disposable plastic plates, cups and cutlery used by fast food vendors. Threat of fines of up to \u00a3152 have resulted in a 70% reduction in the use of plastic bags, and a 25% cut in landfill waste. \u00b7 Ireland&apos;s 15p &quot;plastax&quot; on carrier bags, introduced in 2002, has led to a 90% reduction in use. \u00b7 In France, reusable plastic bags - heavier, easier to recycle and less likely to blow away - now account for more than half of the market. \u00b7 In 2002 Bangladesh became the first country to ban plastic bags. A movement against them began in the 1980s in Dhaka, where bags were found to clog drains in the monsoon rains, causing flooding. \u00b7 San Francisco has become the first US city to ban plastic bags. The ban will be enforced later this year.Isabelle Chevallot"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/may/13/conservation.theobserver", "publicationDate": "2007-05-12T23:04:40Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Conservation", "World news", "Knut", "Wildlife", "Animals"], "sentences": ["The zoo has received business proposals from the US, Taiwan, Japan and China, with one brand consultant estimating revenues from Knut licensing could hit \u00a310m."], "title": "Knut's a millionaire bear, while he's cuddly", "article": "He was rejected by his mother, raised by a devoted keeper and achieved global stardom when an animal rights activist was misquoted as saying he should be put down. Now, like any good German citizen, Knut, the polar bear born in Berlin zoo just before Christmas, is turning out to be a solid, hardworking, business-minded citizen with a social conscience. When the zoo officially registered Knut as a brand trademark, its shares doubled in value. Knut merchandise is selling out at the zoo giftshop, earning around half a million pounds to date. Knut has been seen by half a million visitors since his first public appearance in late March with peak crowds limited to seven minutes&apos; viewing time each, bringing in another million or so.

Not in a threatening, scolding way,&apos; said Uhlich. But knut-mania has its limits. Last month the zoo received a death threat and had to increase Knut&apos;s protection. Anti-Knut graffiti appeared on Berlin walls. And the future could be problematic. When he is one year old, Knut will weigh 90kg to 100kg, said Dr Ragnar Kuehne, curator of mammals at the zoo.

His burly form, in bright braces, is easy to spot when it is time to hit the streets. &quot;Hong Kong is the window to the world. China as a country is becoming stronger and stronger - it needs to assimilate itself with the world&apos;s values,&quot; says Lai. &quot;The major value of the world is democracy. China cannot isolate itself from the major value. If it does, it can never become a world power.&quot; His business products are easy to find on the streets as well - the Chinese-language Apple Daily newspaper, the weekly Next Magazine, and stablemates Easy Finder and Sudden Weekly. Jimmy Lai is that rare character in the wealthy Asian business elite - a successful media tycoon with a passion for talking about democracy as &quot;a moral imperative&quot;. His publications are famous for bringing a new low to local reporting style, splashing blood and sex across their pages; his editorials are consistently in favour of universal suffrage for Hong Kong people. A son of a turtle egg More costly has been his long record of defiance of Beijing. Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese sovereignty 10 years ago amid promises of autonomy under a &quot;one country, two systems&quot; slogan. But most of the business community wants to garner wealth and influence in mainland China and so eagerly plays lackey to the political bosses in China. Not Jimmy Lai. He famously once described the then Chinese leader Li Peng as a son of a turtle egg - a profound insult in Chinese. He has also called the Chinese Communist Party &quot;a monopoly that charges a premium for lousy service&quot;. As a result, his businesses continue to lose potential profits every day. In an interview, Lai said: &quot;There&apos;s a very well organised boycott here. We have almost no real estate advertisement because real estate companies are mostly big companies with business in China. We have 30-35% less ads than we should have. And now the boycott has become very permanent and very organised.&quot; Mark Simon, his group advertising manager, estimates the Next Media Group, which owns all Lai&apos;s publications, has lost about HK$200m so far. Potential advertisers are contacted by Chinese government officials, claims Simon. He recounted meetings between Next Media and Chinese officials where the publishers were told &quot;you know what you&apos;re doing wrong&quot;. Simon says no China-based bank, airline or other large company places ads in a Jimmy Lai product. &quot;We were getting that business until July 1 2003, and since then the boycott has never let up.&quot; That day was the biggest pro-democracy demonstration ever seen in Hong Kong, fuelled by massive dissatisfaction with China&apos;s appointed leader of the territory, Tung Chee-hwa, and by active urgings to march in Next Media. Four years later, following the dramatic collapse of one business idea and the resounding success of new media launches in Taiwan, Lai&apos;s stance has not changed. &quot;I think the people must decide to have democracy, and must come out and fight for it, even by going on the street, by voicing their desire, using all the media, whatever they can do to voice out the need for democracy,&quot; he says. Born in 1948, in southern China, Lai arrived in Hong Kong aged 12 by the then classic route of a fishing boat. He taught himself English, started doing odd jobs in a glove factory and gradually built up capital to invest. When Lai launched Apple Daily in 1995, the fervour he generated was immense. He injected frantic competition into an already crowded market of more than 30 daily Chinese-language newspapers. &quot;The newspapers are driven by Jimmy. We&apos;re a company that&apos;s driven by Jimmy. Jimmy Lai is Next Media. Jimmy is our Richard Branson,&quot; says Simon. He once owned the Giordano clothing chain, a rare example of a home-grown fashion brand, but resigned so as not to impede the company&apos;s progress on the mainland. However, when he ventured into an effort to break the stranglehold of two major business groups in Hong Kong, he came a cropper. That venture, called adMart, aimed to offer an alternative to Hong Kong&apos;s Park&apos;n&apos;Shop and Wellcome supermarkets, owned by two of the largest conglomerates: the Hutchison Whampoa group of Asia&apos;s richest man Li Ka-shing, and Jardine Matheson respectively. Lai claims the feud between him and Li is all one-way, from Li&apos;s side. His papers, meanwhile, gobble up scandal involving the tycoons, and have run investigative pieces that directly hit the interests of Matheson and Li. &quot;We are very bitter enemies because if you have an independent media, you tend to offend those tycoons and all the tycoons think they can dictate a lot of things because they&apos;re so powerful, and sometimes they find they cannot do that and they get really mad,&quot; says Lai. With adMart, vengeance was swift. Suppliers were threatened with loss of business if they supplied Lai&apos;s internet delivery scheme, and adMart died. &quot;AdMart was a failure, it was a stupid idea, a failure,&quot; admits Lai. Unbowed, he took a break from Hong Kong and went to Taiwan, where he set up another Apple Daily and another Next magazine - now among Taiwan&apos;s top reads, and wildly successful. Also, as an experiment, his group has launched a free paper in Taiwan, called Sharp Daily. &quot;If China erodes Hong Kong values more and more . . . we will reach an end of free media and unless media is free I&apos;m not interested in running media as a voice for China,&quot; says Lai. &quot;So I think it&apos;s important that we fight for democracy and freedom here, even [if it is] for self-interest, to keep our media surviving in a right environment.&quot; Independent but shallow Independent pro-democracy lawmaker Emily Lau, who is a former journalist, has described Apple Daily as independent but shallow. One media analyst, asking not to be named, said that Lai&apos;s firm stand for democracy in past years was of course to be admired, but that he was a &quot;slippery fish&quot;, his publishing empire was going nowhere, and Lai was wasting his energies without a clear vision for tackling future challenges. &quot;Oh yeah, and that&apos;s why he&apos;s taken over Taiwan media? He&apos;s taken Taiwan by storm. This is not someone at a dead end,&quot; counters Jake van der Kamp, the most widely read business analyst in Hong Kong. Simon admits Apple Daily took a hit from a peak circulation of about 383,000 in 2000, but that it was now climbing back up and is currently hovering around 287,000. (The longer-established Oriental Daily News is the only paper with a higher circulation.) Simon says the circulation battle is one that is faced by all newspapers coping with the challenges from the internet. In addition, Hong Kong is now home to three freesheets, which has hurt Apple Daily&apos;s figures. &quot;People get up and leave my table [when I&apos;m dining out], they don&apos;t want to sit with me, when they realise I work for Lai,&quot; says Simon. &quot;His greatest sin is that he makes as much money as the big tycoons, and he doesn&apos;t kiss the ring [kowtow to Beijing]. But we&apos;ll be the last man standing.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/may/16/business.waste", "publicationDate": "2007-05-16T17:59:55Z", "tags": ["Society", "Business", "Waste", "Environment", "Conservation"], "sentences": ["\u00b7 Countries and cities that have banned or discouraged the use of plastic bags include: Australia, Bangladesh, Ireland, Italy, Taiwan, Mumbai, Scotland, France, West Bengal, Zanzibar, Tanzania, Switzerland, Rwanda, Denmark, Germany, South Africa, California, Somalia, Botswana, Philippines."], "title": "Carrying conviction", "article": "Two weeks ago, the town of Modbury, in Devon where I was born and raised, with its 43 shopkeepers and traders, was thrown into the spotlight. We never anticipated that our decision to turn our backs on plastic bags and stop selling them or giving them away would hit such an international chord of approval. First came a storm of emails, letters and phone calls. In one day I received more than 800 emails - far too many to answer individually. Many people wanted to pass on their best wishes, but hundreds more wanted to know how we had done it. I was completely overwhelmed. But now the dust has settled, and I find myself in the bizarre position of being the country&apos;s leading source of knowledge about how to turn a town plastic bag-free. What follows is how we got rid of relying on plastic bags, and some pointers for anyone contemplating a community that is plastic bag-free. Many of the people who contacted me said they would like to follow the Modbury example, and asked if I could come to their town to do the same. But, the truth is, this will not work. Sadly, there is no quick fix. My best advice to anyone who wants their town to be free of plastic bags is that they are going to have to fight the fight themselves. You are in a far stronger position than when we did it because you now have Modbury as a success story. Also, there can be no blueprint because every town is different. Every town has different traders, different needs and different attitudes. You, as a local in your community, will know those issues far better than me. If you want to change attitudes in your town you must have the trust of the traders, and to do that it has to come from a local resident. The first and most essential step is the laborious job of doing your homework. To make Modbury plastic shopping bag-free took weeks of research and hard work. Sorry guys, nothing in life is easy, especially changing people&apos;s attitudes. I suggest you learn - really learn - what plastics are doing to the environment, to animals, and how, in particular, plastic is entering the food chain and could be affecting us. This last subject has the potential to shock even the most conservative individual into action. A good place to start for the facts is our website (messageinthewaves.com). From there you can continue to delve as much as you like. After reading up you will see clearly why I was driven to act. Art of conversation The next step is to approach the traders directly. Remember, you are going to have to educate the people in your town on how their actions could be damaging, and to do this you have to know your subject matter. You must be prepared to answer all their questions. A handout from me or anyone else will not persuade them. Engaging in conversation is the best way to win them over. Many people have asked if I applied for help with my cause through grants, or the local council or chambers of commerce. But I did none of these. If I had, I am certain we would still be spinning wheels and caught up in red tape. Instead, I started with the traders who were my friends, suggesting to them the possibility of making Modbury plastic shopping bag-free. After that, I invited all the town&apos;s traders to an evening at which I showed the BBC film I had made about the effect of plastic bags in the Pacific Ocean. I then provided them with the names of bag wholesalers with environmental bag alternatives. Some days later, I began individually approaching those traders I was less familiar with, and was pleased to see that wind of my campaign had already reached them. Slowly, I started to tick off the list those who backed my efforts to be plastic-free. But it was not all easy going, and some said: &quot;I like my plastic bags.&quot; This is where the research into what plastic does to the environment came in very handy. Once I started throwing a few statistics at them, their faces dropped and we soon got into conversation. For anyone still sitting on the fence, I called in the help of those traders already on board. While visiting the shops, I asked what plastic bags they used and for what purpose. Things then became a lot more complicated. Nearly every trader needed something different from bags, whether it was strength, size, appearance or material. The next step, then, was to research every type of environmental bag on the market. You might start with the list of wholesalers on the Modbury website (plasticbagfree.com). However, it is imperative that you learn about where your bags have come from. Are they fair trade? What materials are they made from? Where and how are those materials sourced? Are they sustainable? If there are supermarkets or large chain stores in your town they will surely ask you these questions. If you can&apos;t answer them, they will not take you seriously. As the magnitude of the task I had undertaken dawned on me, I started to look for advice from other areas in the country that had made this move. To my shock, I realised that nowhere in Europe had. My rescue came from Australia and a brilliant charity called Planet Ark. The co-founder, Jon Dee, had helped more than 20 Australian towns go plastic bag-free, and was a great help to me and a world of advice. The next stage was to set a date. All the Modbury traders agreed to a complete changeover just one month away. The big day was May 1. We created a chamber of trade letter, a gentlemen&apos;s agreement, stating that from then on no plastic bags were to be issued. Over the following month we had weekly group meetings, at which one of the key issues to resolve was what to charge for the reusable and compostable bag alternatives (\u00a33.95). We kept our mission simple, thinking only of what we were doing as a service to the environment, never to make a profit. In Modbury, the campaign has galvanised the traders and a new community spirit has awakened. As for me, I only ever saw myself as a bridge between what I witnessed while filming in the waters around Hawaii and the traders of my home town. My place in life is educating people, through my camerawork, about what is happening to our environment - and that is what I am now returning to. I could only have done this campaign in Modbury because the traders trusted me. The town has a great community but we are nothing special - neither am I. All we did was get out there and make it happen. I hope our story will inspire you to take the message to your own community and do the same. Plastic plague \u00b7 The world uses more than 1.2 trillion plastic bags a year - an average of about 300 bags for every adult, or 1m bags used per minute. \u00b7 On average, we use each plastic bag for 12 minutes before discarding it. It then can last in the environment for decades. \u00b7 47% of windborne litter escaping from landfills is plastic - much of it plastic bags. \u00b7 About 80% of all marine rubbish comes from off the land, and nearly 90% is plastic. In June 2006 the UN environment programme estimated that there were an average of 46,000 pieces of plastic debris floating on or near the surface of every square mile of ocean. \u00b7 Plastic bag litter is lethal in the marine environment, killing at least 100,000 birds, whales, seals and turtles every year. After an animal is killed by plastic bags, its body decomposes and the plastic is released back into the environment, where it can kill again. \u00b7 A report, Plastic Debris in the World&apos;s Oceans, by Greenpeace, suggests that at least 267 marine species are known to have suffered from entanglement or ingestion of marine debris. An estimated 1 million seabirds choke or get tangled in plastic nets or other debris every year. \u00b7 Countries and cities that have banned or discouraged the use of plastic bags include: Australia, Bangladesh, Ireland, Italy, Taiwan, Mumbai, Scotland, France, West Bengal, Zanzibar, Tanzania, Switzerland, Rwanda, Denmark, Germany, South Africa, California, Somalia, Botswana, Philippines. \u00b7 Plastic bags do not biodegrade, they photodegrade - break down into smaller and smaller bits, contaminating soil, waterways and oceans, and entering the food chain when ingested by animals. \u00b7 Email your comments to society@theguardian.com.

Ashraf Ghani, chairman of Kabul University, is a likely option if President Bush decides to break with tradition and appoint a non-American. A former World Bank economist, Ghani left in 2001 to help rebuild the Afghan economy after the war of 2001 began. It was reported last month that he headed the White House&apos;s list of candidates to replace Wolfowitz. Bookmaker Ladbrokes today installed him as the 4/5 favourite. Another non-US candidate - and the only woman currently tipped as a Wolfowitz successor - is Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. Another former World Bank staffer, she has served as both Nigeria&apos;s finance minister and foreign minister. Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters today that she had not been approached about the job. &quot;It is an institution that is very worthy and I really believe in the institution. It needs a lot of healing,&quot; she said. But a large obstacle stands between both candidates and the prestigious post \u2013 the US government has indicated that it wants to replace its former deputy secretary of defence with another American. Robert Zoellick, former deputy secretary of state, has been named as one credible option, as has Robert Kimmitt, current deputy secretary at the US Treasury. Respected economist Joe Stiglitz has claimed that Tony Blair is in consideration for the top job at the bank. &quot;He is one of the people that is clearly being discussed,&quot; Stiglitz said, adding that he would prefer to see a candidate with more experience in economics and development. Ladbrokes, though, does not appear to see Mr Blair as a likely choice, offering odds on his appointment of 25/1 . Ashraf Ghani (4/5 favourite at Ladbrokes) Born in Kabul, he returned to Afghanistan after the US-led invasion in 2001. As finance minister he overhauled the country&apos;s treasury, brought in a new currency and attracted $28bn in aid from the international community. He is chancellor of Kabul University. He joined the World Bank in 1991, and managed large-scale development programmes in China, India and Russia. Previously tipped as a future secretary general of the United Nations, there have been suggestions that Mr Ghani might be too volatile and impatient. One acquaintance told the Financial Times last year that &quot;given that he blows up at even his closest friends, I can&apos;t see him as the world&apos;s leading peacemaker&quot;. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala (5/2) She has been credited with a key role in fighting corruption and pushing economic reform in Nigeria during her three-year stint as finance minister. She also attempted to crack down on the &quot;419&quot; scam, in which fraudsters send emails, letters and faxes offering a share of a fictitious fortune. She studied at Harvard, and has a PhD in regional economics and development from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In June 2006 she became Nigeria&apos;s foreign minister, resigning three months later. Before becoming finance minister in 2003, she was vice-president and corporate secretary of the World Bank. Robert Zoellick (7/2) As number two to Condoleezza Rice at the State Department, he was seen as a counterpoint to more hardline voices such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. But he quit in June 2006 after 16 months as deputy secretary of state, and is currently on the board of Goldman Sachs. In February 2001 he began a four-year stint as US trade representative, negotiating the entry of China and Taiwan into the World Trade Organisation. Zoellick attracted headlines last year after posing in China cuddling a panda cub, in an attempt to illustrate the warm relations between China and the US. Robert Kimmitt (5/1) The current deputy treasury secretary has been seen as a potential safe pair of hands for the Bank. He served in Vietnam, where he was awarded three Bronze Star medals, the Purple Heart, the Air Medal and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. He has plenty of political experience, having served as ambassador to Germany between 1991 and 1993, and undersecretary of state for political affairs from 1989 to 1991. Kimmitt&apos;s boss, Henry Paulson, has also been suggested as a candidate but the treasury secretary is not thought to be interested. Stanley Fischer (14/1) Current governor of the bank of Israel, he was vice-president, development economics and chief economist at the World Bank between 1988 and 1990. From 1994 to 2001 he was first deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund. Very well regarded as an economist, but his links to the Clinton administration may harm his chances. Senator Richard Luger (14/1) Indiana&apos;s representative in the US Senate, he is the ranking minority member on the foreign relations committee. John Bolton (16/1) Forced to resign as America&apos;s ambassador to the United Nations after failing to assuage concerns over his brusque style and criticisms of the UN. Tony Blair (25/1) Like Wolfowitz he is working out his notice. Blair has said he hopes to promote peace in the Middle East and inter-faith dialogue after he finally vacates Downing Street on June 27. Donald Rumsfeld (100/1) The two-time secretary of defence and architect of the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan is available, having resigned last November after the Republican party lost control of the House of Representatives and the Senate. However, he may not be seen as an ideal choice to unite a divided World Bank and counter criticism that the US should cede control of the selection process for its presidency."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/18/cricket.englandcricketseries1", "publicationDate": "2007-05-18T15:29:42Z", "tags": ["Cricket", "Sport", "England v West Indies 2007"], "sentences": ["116th over: England 415-5 (Bell 69 Prior 36) Chung Mao writes &quot;Greetings from Taiwan, I am bank manager of bank of overseas Taiwan I have a business tansaction for you please get back to me of more details.&quot; Which is great, really friendly, Chung."], "title": "England v West Indies, over-by-over: evening session", "article": "Afternoon everyone.

Not satisfied with that piece of buffonery, he repeats himself for emphasis. These things sound more authoritative when you say them twice. Say them twice. Anyway, Nasser soon has a chance to describe Prior&apos;s second Test boundary and then his third as well: Bravo catches his outside edge and watches aghast as the ball squirms down to third man for four, and then digs in a bouncer which is larrupped through mid-wicket for four more. Throw in a pair of wides and it is a disgusting over for the Windies.   112th over: England 389-5 (Bell 61 Prior 18) Botham announces that there are still 43 overs to go today, which damn near breaks my spirit.

The only reason Prior is in the team is Peter Moores. Will he still be there come the end of the summer? I doubt it.   113th over: England 391-5 (Bell 62 Prior 18) Ian Bell has been so unobtrusive today that it seemed as though Collingwood was batting on his own.

Bloody hell stop the presses, that is worth writing home about. Sod off back to neighbours why don&apos;t you, it&apos;ll be on again in an hour. More appealling than that cart load of obnoxious whining is the four that Bell has clipped away through mid-wicket.   115th over: England 407-5 (Bell 69 Prior 31) Prior thunders a cover drive away for four and holds the pose becuas ehe knows it looks good. He knocks two more out to long-on from the next. Well seems like there are a bunch of you who are big Matt Prior fans, so I&apos;ve made myself a raft of new OBO enemies. Last word goes to James McKemey who is &quot;The lad who had his U12 Sussex batting spot stolen by Matt when he arrived from SA. I&apos;m not bitter.&quot; James reckons: &quot;I think taking the first few games of the year as the only thing to base your disapproval of Matty P seems a tad harsh. He has been consistently strong over the past few years and has earned his opportunity, Batty is somewhat older, not much younger than Nixon and Ambrose is still unproven.&quot; Aye but what of Foster, Read, Wallace and Davies eh? There are a host of potential &apos;keepers out there, and I don&apos;t see what Prior has that they don&apos;t other than a four-run advantage in his average.  116th over: England 415-5 (Bell 69 Prior 36) Chung Mao writes &quot;Greetings from Taiwan, I am bank manager of bank of overseas Taiwan I have a business tansaction for you please get back to me of more details.&quot; Which is great, really friendly, Chung. I&apos;ll be in touch. Kirsten Dunst, yes really, applauds as Prior slams another four through mid-wicket. How many fours do they want to gift him?  117th over: England 416-5 (Bell 69 Prior 37) It&apos;s all a little tetchy round these parts today isn&apos;t it? &quot;Can you please stop the whinging about how slow the scoring is? It&apos;s a Test match, sure we&apos;d love to see 12 an over carnage, but it&apos;s not going to happen. Especially when you&apos;ve got a team trying to recover some form after taking one hell of a beating in their last series. And Bell&apos;s scoring at a rate almost identical to Collingwood&apos;s innings. Not everyone can be as great as Owais Shah.&quot; Jack Fray putting the world to rights this Friday afternoon. And uh, that&apos;s it for this over I&apos;m afraid.   118th over: England 418-5 (Bell 69 Prior 38) Really, this bowling is just stupid. Bounce him once, he hits it for four. Bounce him again, he hits it for four again. And again. He&apos;s not even looked like miscuing one. &quot;If all these keepers are of the same value then the one with the best batting average wins. You&apos;ve answered your own question&quot; chirrups Richard Jones, yes, possibly, or possibly it&apos;s the one who is the boss&apos;s favourite. Bravo and Prior exchange huge grins as yet another bouncer whistles harmlessly by the batsman&apos;s helmet.   119th over: England 420-5 (Bell 69 Prior 38) &quot;Nas is clearly a fan of Jonny Borrell, he even knows his band is called &quot;Razorlike&apos;&quot;, Jack Campbell spots the barrel, sees the fish and shoots it. Sky are filling the screens with pictures of old men dribbling into their beards while they sleep. They may or may not be currently sat around the GU sports desk.   120th over: England 425-5 (Bell 69 Prior 43) Corey Collymore comes on. As does Tom Cole: &quot;Moores selection of Prior is what Fletcher&apos;s selection of Jones was. And he&apos;ll do the same as Jones - score early runs against an average country thereby convincing the selectors to give him a chance, only to go on to drop countless chances and score no runs. People have short memories.&quot; An edge skews off Prior&apos;s bat and unsurprisingly drops short of Chris Gayle, running away through his grasp for four. Prior does a neat shimmy and square drives a single off the sixth to keep the strike.   121st over: England 434-5 (Bell 72 Prior 52) &quot;If that clown sitting next to Kirsten Dunst is her boyfriend then I&apos;m topping myself!&quot; Umm, Seth Ennis, that chap would be the aforementioned Jonny Borrell of Nas&apos;s beloved &apos;Razorlike&apos;. As Prior viciously pulls four more through long-on he brings up his fifty. Suppose I should stop slating him some time soon then. Sky tells me he is the sixth England &apos;keeper to score a fifty on his debut, which just shows that we shouldn&apos;t be getting too excited about him just yet.   122nd over: England 443-5 (Bell 78 Prior 52) Here&apos;s a little something from Robert Cotterrel for us all to chew on: &quot;England&apos;s key problem isn&apos;t finding a wicket keeper who can bat it must trying to find some bowlers who can bat. None of Hoggard, Harmy, Monty, Plunkett, Jones, Anderson, Mahmood et al know which end to hold. Against quality bowling attacks, this is ruthlessly exposed, like in the winter.&quot; Aaaah look. I&apos;m not really that down on Bell, Prior or the scoring rate: it&apos;s Friday afternoon, I feel like a pair of pigs are rutting in my head and I want to go home, that&apos;s all. Bell steps down the pitch and swats Collymore&apos;s latest away with a neat flick of his wrists for four.   123rd over: England 446-5 (Bell 80 Prior 56) &quot;Just looking at a career average tells you very little.&quot;is the wise beginning of Tim Reston, &quot;Not only does Batty open the batting for Surrey (which means he faces the new ball and the best bowlers in other county teams) but his average over the last 3-4 years has been excellent. Trouble is if you just click on his stats via Cricinfo or similar you only see his overall average which while good is not outstanding. And why is 33 or whatever too old? Bob Taylor (and Alec Stewart) both kept until they were much older than that.&quot; Aye, that&apos;s all good stuff that is. It just amazes me that he is so consistently ignored when we have these wicketkeeping debates. I&apos;m not saying he is the best, but he should at least have had a shot. A quiet over, enlivened only by a misfield that gifted Bell a second run from his push to the off.  124th over: England 457-5 (Bell 81 Prior 65) Sarwan has brought himself on for a little stint of leg spin. Prior moves onto 60 by swatting a rank loosener through mid-wicket, and then onto to 64 by slicing the next down to fine leg. Sarwan once had the wood on Andy Flintoff, and got him out twice in succession. It doesn&apos;t look like he&apos;ll be doing anything similar to Prior. By the time the over has ended Sarwan looks a little less smug, as you would haveing just gifted 11 runs.   125th over: England 463-5 (Bell 81 Prior 72) Prior screws a leading edge through third man for four, though he was aiming for mid-wicket. These two have put on 100 now, of which Ian Bell has contributed all of 25. &quot;Surely Alec Stewart should NEVER be used to justify a point in an argument as Tim Reston did in over 123.&quot; Unless, Chris Powell, you wanted to show why players shouldn&apos;t go into the commentary box.   126th over: England 467-5 (Bell 83 Prior 72) More names here, so we&apos;re going to need a very big hat: &quot;Quite frankly, Jon Batty plays for Surrey, which rules him out in my book. What about Greek-South African Nic Pothas - once he&apos;s finished his flag-waving exam anyway?&quot; that from Stevie Holford, while Richard Moore suggests: &quot;I&apos;m sure I heard some rumblings that Northants&apos; wicket keeper Riki Wessels has been suggested as a potential England &apos;keeper. If true surely this would make the Wessels family the most mercenary family in cricket?&quot; Just four runs from Sarwan&apos;s second over.   127th over: England 469-5 (Bell 84 Prior 73) &quot;So are you willing to agree with me that the boy god Bell is actually showing why he is vital to this England team, more so than Shah. Yours smugly, although expecting Bell to get out via wafting outside off stump in the next over or so.&quot; Ahhh, Andy Bradshaw, I don&apos;t know. He&apos;s played well, but this bowling is pretty gimme gimme no? Gayle is on, a man who, like Williams in Enter the Dragon, doesn&apos;t ever seem to notice defeat because &apos;he&apos;s too busy looking good&apos;.   128th over: England 478-5 (Bell 84 Prior 77) Sarwan is still wheeling away - is this the least menacing dual spin attack in Test cricket? I suspect so. So does Matt Prior, who, with his latest swivelled pull for four, has now scored more runs in this innings than he has in all three of his Championship games for Sussex this year.   129th over: England 481-5 (Bell 86 Prior 78) Adam Singleton wants to know: &quot;What are people&apos;s views on a declaration? I reckon we ask the boys out there to throw the bat at everything, get to 520-530 by 5.45pm and stick them in for a go at them tonight. Any problems with that?&quot; Yes, frankly. I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll get a declaration today: why bother? There are still three days to play, and the extra 75 runs they&apos;d score will probably be more use than a 40 minute bowling spell tonight.   131st over: England 494-5 (Bell 89 Prior 86) Prior slaps four through long-off, and everyone at the desk sods off to the pub, ready to break out into joyous celebrations when Bell brings up his 200 some time next Tuesday. Marc Rogers has rumbled me: &quot;Oi! I&apos;m on to you, Bull. Since over 123 (at least) you have been giving Prior far more runs than the increase in total score allows. In fact, I don&apos;t think you are even watching the cricket. When I get home and turn on the telly, I&apos;ll find out that England were bowled out before lunch, Botham&apos;s commentary is both colourful and insightful, and Johnny Borell isn&apos;t going out with Dunst (because he&apos;s too busy oogling himself). I wonder who else has been lying to me today...&quot; I&apos;ve only got 22 overs left to make up.  132nd over: England 497-5 (Bell 92 Prior 90) As Prior closes in on overtaking Bell, I hope you all remember how much we raved about Geraint Jones when he took a century off New Zealand in his first Tests in England. Bell dabs a pair past short fine leg, and blimey, Prior has really upped the run rate hasn&apos;t he? It was only a moment ago that the 400 was up wasn&apos;t it?   133rd over: England 501-5 (Bell 94 Prior 91) I&apos;m momentarily distracted by some breaking news about Mourinho&apos;s dog. Between that and the Neighbours thing, this must be the slowest news day in recent years. Anyway, what the hell was I going on about? Yes, the best route is to take the A34.... Oh no, that&apos;s not it. Bugger it, I&apos;m leaving this over, now...  134th over: England 507-5 (Bell 95 Prior 95) Sarwan sends down a stinking, filthy long hop that Prior batters for four through mid-wicket. Ludicrously, he is now level with Bell.   135th over: England 515-5 (Bell 95 Prior 103) Louise Wrightr has rumbled me back: &quot;You can&apos;t possibly be making it up. Point 1 is it&apos;d be a damn sight more interesting (meteorite strike on Bell would be favourite as far as I&apos;m concerned), and point 2 is surely you&apos;d&apos;ve had Prior getting out ludicrously easily for a score of squat all?&quot; Prior leans outside off and sweeps a couple around the corner in most ungainly fashion. He&apos;s on 99, and tries to premeditate a sweep, Gayle pulls out of the delivery and gives him a wry grin. And there it is! Prior has a hundred, brought up with a cut through the off that skims across the turf for four.   136th over: England 518-5 (Bell 98 Prior 105) Prior&apos;s shots have come all around the ground, and, as much as I&apos;ve knocked him, it&apos;s been a very good innings, albeit againstsome very very poor bowling. Poor old Ian Bell, who for the second session today has appeared almost invisible in comparison to his partner, is waiting on his own hundred now. Prior drives two tidy runs through extra cover.   137th over: England 520-5 (Bell 98 Prior 105) &quot;I am painfully excited. Prior has now scored the highest Test score ever by an Englishman called Matthew. The question is: from which other Matthew has he wrested the crown? If this email makes me sad then I am happy to be sad.&quot; That&apos;s a rathr good question Tom Bowtell, and I don&apos;t know the answer. But I&apos;m guessing it&apos;s not Matthew Fleming.   138th over: England 524-5 (Bell 100 Prior 105) Bell brings up his century with a dab to fine leg. Good stuff really, though it appeared rather hard graft at times. It&apos;s his sixth Test ton, and interestingly, four of them have come at no6. Time for some sage freom G Naylor: &quot;I can remember an Englishman making a century on debut vs the West Indies: Frank Hayes in 1973. In his subsequent eight Tests (all, curiously, against the Windies), he scored 122 runs at 8.1 and never wore the three lions again.&quot;   139th over: England 527-5 (Bell 102 Prior 108) Why can&apos;t these people sat behind me shut up? Huh? Don&apos;t they know that I&apos;m working with a delicate head? Honestly. A HA, I think James Matthews(a suitable surname given the matter in hand, no?) must have nailed it: &quot;Was the highest previous score by a Matthew record held by the inestimable Matthew Maynard?&quot;. Bell adds two with a dainty back cut. There seems to be a lot of umming and aaahing about declarations and the quality of the light and things like this. If England do declare, there&apos;s a good chance that the umpires will just offer the West Indians the light you see. Anyway, little Eoin Morgan, the 12th man, is running on with a message for the batsmen....  140th over: England 534-5 (Bell 103 Prior 111) Gruesomely, Prior has just opened and downed an entire can of Red Bull in a single slurp. Prior makes a hash of a reverse sweep and flicks it accidently over slip for two. He&apos;s no Paul Nixon, I tell thee.   141st over: England 541-5 (Bell 103 Prior 111) The umpires offer the light, which the batsmen decline. Tom Bowtell returns with his Matthew poser: &quot;James Matthews is close, but Mr Maynard is third on the list...&quot;. Prior puts more distance between himself and the mysterious next best Matthew by cracking a lofted drive over mid-off and away to the ropes for four. The next ball is, finally, a bouncer with menace and purpose and it cracks Prior on his helmet, before spinning away to the boundary at third man while he collapses to the floor. Pumped up on Red Bull as he is, he&apos;s soon back on his feet.  142nd over: England 549-5 (Bell 106 Prior 122) Eoin Morgan runs out with a new pair of gloves, which Ian Bell doesn&apos;t even put on as he listens to whatever word the 12th is passing on from the dressing room. Darren Kelly has pointed out that: &quot;Matthew Maynard isn&apos;t an Englishman; he&apos;s from Wales!&quot; which is true but not so very true as this from Tom Stewart: &quot;Matthew Maynard&apos;s highest is 35, Matthew Hoggard (for it is he) has the previous highest score by a Matthew with 38.&quot; Ah ha! You cunning swine Bowtell. West Indies have four centurions of their own now, only they are bowlers rather than batsmen, which isn&apos;t what you want when you&apos;ve won the toss really is it? Prior plays a terrible shot, stepping to leg and swinging wildy, spooning the ball high into the air and away for four fortuitous runs.   142nd over: England 553-5 (Bell 109 Prior 126) Prior biffs a final four through leg and that is it. The umpires end play due to dangerous conditions.Prior and Bell walk off to a standing ovation. I wonder how much more of Matt Prior we will see over the years? Why do I remain unconvinced by that brilliant debut?   Oh yes, that&apos;s right, it&apos;s because the Windies attack is weaker than that of almost any County side - except perhaps Northamptonshire. That&apos;s that then, see you back here tomorrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/may/20/marksspencer.theobserver", "publicationDate": "2007-05-19T23:33:03Z", "tags": ["Business", "Marks & Spencer"], "sentences": ["M&amp;S already has a significant overseas presence with around 200 stores as far afield as Taiwan."], "title": "M&S chief bets on restaurants, revamps and foreign stores", "article": "Marks &amp; Spencer boss Stuart Rose has already secured his sainthood in the business world after leading one of the most impressive turnarounds in retail history. The share price has more than doubled on his watch, making the premium represented by Sir Philip Green&apos;s 400p takeover offer in 2004 seem laughable as bullish analysts now push price targets north of \u00a38. This week the charismatic chief executive will pitch up in the City to deliver a 30 per cent hike in profits to \u00a3966.3m, a whisker away from the record \u00a31bn achieved by Sir Rick Greenbury in 1998. Three years in, Rose has harvested the low-hanging fruit by sharpening up prices and restoring the group&apos;s fashion credibility with British women. Sales are expected to have climbed from \u00a37.8bn to \u00a38.6bn. But unfortunately for Rose the story doesn&apos;t end there. He has pledged two more years&apos; service and they promise to be difficult. He must set in train sustainable growth for a retailer that has had more stints in rehab than George Best, and anoint a successor along the way. At the moment the City&apos;s eyes are firmly trained on how management is juggling the disruption caused by one of the most ambitious store refurbishment programmes ever undertaken. It will spend \u00a3750m this year and again next year tackling its 300-strong estate and analysts are worried the challenge presented by some of its decrepit city centre stores could result in a DIY SOS. &apos;They have not spelled out the full cost of the refurbishment programme, especially the bigger stores,&apos; says HSBC analyst Paul Smiddy. He is also concerned that the refurbishments will result in &apos;significant&apos; sales disruption. This year will be the big push, with 70 per cent of stores supposed to be looking pristine by Christmas. The risk is magnified as Rose is donning his hard hat against a consumer downturn as higher interest rates put pressure on shoppers&apos; pockets. This week arch rival Next said sales at its stores have continued to fall since the start of the year as unpredictable weather patterns played havoc with shoppers&apos; wardrobe choices. Trade at M&amp;S is expected to have been similarly volatile although it is not expected to spill the beans on current trading on Tuesday. &apos;It has been an amazing recovery but share prices don&apos;t tend to go up in a straight line, the next move could be down,&apos; says Pali Capital analyst Nick Bubb. &apos;The big unknown is current trading. However, M&amp;S has got property and food and both are in demand.&apos; But analysts at Lehman Brothers are bullish, raising their target price for the stock, which closed the week at 743.5p, from 750p to 830p. The optimism is fuelled by the recent bid for Sainsbury&apos;s that hinged on value stored in its freehold property estate. It believes M&amp;S looks relatively cheap if its \u00a34.5bn of freehold is considered. Some of the capital tied up in its stores could be unlocked and used to stretch the horizon of what Rose believes is a powerful brand that customers look to in the same way as John Lewis. M&amp;S has already dipped its toes in new product categories, such as opening electricals departments, and Rose has signalled the growing importance of the internet. But analysts believe he will make bold international steps before he retires. M&amp;S already has a significant overseas presence with around 200 stores as far afield as Taiwan. But these are almost entirely franchises and the expectation is that the retailer will again pursue the more profitable but riskier course of owning and operating its own stores abroad. The appointment of former De Vere Group chief executive Carl Leaver as international business director in last month&apos;s reshuffle was seen as clear evidence that overseas stores were creeping up Rose&apos;s strategic agenda. Western Europe is seen as the jumping off point as Rose has already lamented predecessor Roger Holmes&apos;s decision to shut its French business but there are big prizes to go for in emerging markets such as India. At home M&amp;S sees potential to grow its \u00a34bn food business by up to 25 per cent with several growth strands already identified. The hiring of Steven Esom from foodie rival Waitrose is seen to usher in a new era for the Simply Food chain. Rose has already identified potential for a catering division and has upped the ante, striking a forecourt deal with BP, opening delis and a trial 150-seater restaurant adjacent to its Newcastle store quaintly called &apos;kitchen&apos;. Analysts see potential for up to 40 such restaurants. But lest we forget M&amp;S is Britain&apos;s largest clothing retailer, Rose has stopped it bleeding market share to rivals with womenswear, menswear and lingerie all registering growth. Smiddy says M&amp;S must find a way to reach the under-40s. Until recently, its poor track record in childrenswear has meant young mums have defected to New Look and Primark. He believes work needs to be done to elevate Limited Collection, its fast-fashion sub brand, to the level of Per Una, created by Next founder George Davies. &apos;There remains the greatest scope for improved performance in childrenswear and fashion sales to younger customers,&apos; says Smiddy. He also complains that some of its menswear is &apos;arguably over-sensible&apos; and &apos;dull&apos;. As for who will pick up the baton from Rose there are several runners and riders. At 56 years old, M&amp;S marketing chief Steve Sharp is excluded on age grounds and is expected to follow Rose out the door when his share options mature. At 42, the mild-mannered Esom, who left the John Lewis Partnership after missing out on the top job, is in the frame but some observers say he lacks City experience and clothing retail expertise. Fellow new recruit Leaver, 39, is also well-placed but is not from a retail blueblood having worked at Whitbread and Travel Inn before De Vere. Its clothing guru Kate Bostock, 49, is in with a shout. She is the product queen. Her leadership ability is unknown, but Belinda Earl, who now runs Jaegar, pulled off a similar move at Debenhams, however. Rose has joked that at 58 he is not getting younger. But when the Savile Row-suit wearing saviour of M&amp;S strolls into the sunset he will leave large, no doubt expensive, shoes to fill."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/25/tennis.frenchopen2007", "publicationDate": "2007-05-25T13:04:21Z", "tags": ["Tennis", "Sport", "French Open 2007"], "sentences": ["The draw in full: Men (w-wild card;

The Swiss, dreaming of capturing the only grand slam title to have eluded him, was drawn in the same half as several dangerous opponents, including former champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. He could also run into Tommy Robredo, Marat Safin, Ivan Ljubicic, Nikolay Davydenko, David Nalbandian, Guillermo Canas and Fernando Gonzalez. Twice defending champion Rafael Nadal, the world number two, was handed a far easier draw for the tournament, which starts at Roland Garros this Sunday. Top seed Federer will start with a relatively easy match against little-known American Michael Russell and should not be challenged in the next two rounds. From the fourth round, however, things are likely to get a lot more complicated for him as he could meet Spaniard Ferrero, the 2003 champion. If he survives that, a possible semi-final clash against Gonzalez could be on the cards. Nadal will start against unheralded Argentinian Juan Martin Del Potro and has a smooth passage through to the fourth round, in which he could meet Australian Lleyton Hewitt. Former champion Carlos Moya of Spain and American Andy Roddick, seeded third, could then stand in the 20-year-old&apos;s way before a possible semi-final encounter with Serbia&apos;s Novak Djokovic, seeded sixth. England&apos;s Tim Henman will play Latvia&apos;s Ernests Gulbis in the first round. If he wins, and beats 25th seed Robin Soderling or Albert Montanes in the second round, the British number two could then take on reigning two-time champion Rafael Nadal in round three. Gulbis, 18, is a talented right-hander who has shot up the rankings since turning professional in 2005. He ended 2006 ranked 139th position in the world, and is currently 84th in the charts. He has already won challenger events in Besancon and Sarajevo this year. Henman, who has been troubled by knee problems this season, has slipped to 52nd in the world after a poor start to 2007. He has yet to win even a set in his two matches on clay this year. He was dumped out of the Masters event in Monte Carlo in April at the first-round stage by Juan Carlos Ferrero, and suffered the same fate at the hands of Nicolas Almagro in Rome earlier this month. Henman chose not to compete in the recent Masters event in Hamburg in a bid to fine-tune his preparations for Roland Garros. In the women&apos;s draw, the top contenders look set to progress smoothly through to the latter stages. World number one Justine Henin, who like Nadal is chasing a third successive crown, starts against Russia&apos;s Elena Vesnina, while Maria Sharapova, the second seed but not a clay court specialist, will face French woman Emilie Loit in the first round.

The Bush administration, bruised by the fallout after the former Pentagon deputy was forced to step down after granting pay rises to his girlfriend, turned to Mr Zoellick, an experienced Washington insider who served as Condoleezza Rice&apos;s number two at the state department and played a key role in the reunification of Germany in 1990. Sources in the World Bank said the announcement followed careful negotiations by the US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, with leading governments, including Britain and Germany, in which Mr Zoellick&apos;s name was mentioned as the top choice. &quot;It certainly could be worse. He&apos;s a solid appointment - he&apos;s not a former architect of the Iraq war,&quot; said Ken Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at Harvard University. White House officials said Mr Bush intended to formally announce Mr Zoellick&apos;s nomination today and they were confident he would be endorsed by the bank&apos;s board of directors. If approved, he would take over on June 30, when Mr Wolfowitz steps down. Mr Zoellick&apos;s nomination maintains the US prerogative of choosing an American for the post which has been criticised following the disastrous tenure of Mr Wolfowitz. Aid agencies and some governments argue that the appointment process should be open to other nationalities and conducted transparently. The US has selected the head of the World Bank since the institution was founded 60 years ago, while European governments have chosen the head of its sister organisation, the International Monetary Fund. Gene Sperling, an economist during the Clinton administration and a senior fellow at the Council of Foreign Relations, said Mr Zoellick was a &quot;very smart and very serious&quot; operator. &quot;He&apos;s been seen as the one person in the Bush administration who is a true internationalist and that probably put him in favour with many of the key G8 partners that the administration wanted to get on board,&quot; he said. The new president faces enormous challenges in healing the wounds within the bank after Mr Wolfowitz&apos;s controversial reign, which provoked a staff revolt, as well as overhauling the bank&apos;s role. Experts say it needs to focus on giving grants to very poor countries, and scale down the amount of lending to middle-income countries. Nancy Birdsall, president of the Centre for Global Development, while praising Mr Zoellick&apos;s analytical skills and experience, said: &quot;The question is whether other countries will be satisfied that he is indeed the best candidate, for example, whether he has the right management skills.&quot; Described by former colleagues as a policy wonk with sharp elbows, Mr Zoellick&apos;s background means he is familiar with the rigours of international diplomacy. Before his official jobs under Mr Bush, he served as a protege of James Baker, a long-time confident of the Bush family. Mr Zoellick helped run two presidential election campaigns and served in the administration of Mr Bush&apos;s father. \u00b7 Profile: Robert Zoellick Robert Zoellick may hail from the conservative wing of US Republican party but, unlike his predecessor, Paul Wolfowitz, he has a formidable record in financial and economic governance. After a spell at the treasury and a stint as economics undersecretary of state in the 1980s, he returned to a more senior role in 2001 as George Bush&apos;s first trade representative, the chief US trade negotiator. During his four years in the job, he helped launched the Doha round of world trade talks and negotiations to bring China and Taiwan into the WTO. He moved to the state department before leaving government for Goldman Sachs and a job as managing director."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/may/30/jerryfalwelllivesinpoland", "publicationDate": "2007-05-30T13:00:00Z", "tags": ["US news", "Poland", "Religion", "Family", "Life and style", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Delegates from Taiwan, Nigeria and other countries, amazed by the information they were hearing, said they would spread the word as soon as they got home."], "title": "Jerry Falwell lives ... in Poland", "article": "Jerry Falwell is dead, but in Warsaw, his legacy lives on. By now, you&apos;ve probably seen headlines like the one on the Reuters website: &quot;Poland to probe if Teletubbies are gay&quot;. Alarmed by the effeminacy of the violet-hued blob Tinky Winky, Ewa Sowinska, a government official in charge of children&apos;s rights, has asked psychologists to determine whether the TV show promotes homosexuality, which could lead to a recommendation to take it off the air. It may seem like the recently deceased Falwell, who also espied sexual subversion in the popular children&apos;s program, is speaking to Sowinska from the grave. As with all miracles, though, there&apos;s a more earthly explanation. Just two weeks ago, Sowinksa was at the World Congress of Families, an international gathering that brought stars of the American Christian right together with leading Polish politicians, Vatican officials and sundry other crusaders from all over the US, Europe, Latin America and Africa. Ellen Sauerbrey, US assistant secretary of state for population, refugees and migration, was there to lend the imprimatur of the Bush White House. For three days, in the monumental Palace of Science and Culture that Stalin built in the center of Warsaw, many of the frauds and canards of the American religious right - that homosexuality is a curable disorder; that abortion causes breast cancer and birth control pills cause abortion; that sex education leads children to debauchery - were translated into many languages and transmitted to politicians, pundits and preachers who will carry them, virus like, to their own countries. It isn&apos;t much of a stretch to suppose that Sowinska was first alerted to the moral danger of Teletubbies at the Congress, which drew several thousand attendees. As she told a Polish magazine, she&apos;d been wondering why Tinky Winky carried a purse. &quot;Later I learned that this may have a homosexual undertone,&quot; she said. Taken alone, this would be merely absurd, but it is symptomatic of something slightly more serious. Anxiety about the Teletubbies&apos; orientation is far from the only religious right meme that&apos;s taking off globally. Over the last several years, the Christian right has become increasingly active on the international stage. Initiatives to introduce so-called intelligent design - an intellectually tarted-up version of creationism - have been launched in Germany and Holland, of all places. Meanwhile, George Bush has put activists like Concerned Women for America&apos;s Janice Crouse and Christian radio host Janet Parshall on US delegations to UN conferences, and a number of Christian right NGOs have aquired consultative status at the United Nations, giving their messages a veneer of legitimacy. In March, for example, during a meeting of the UN&apos;s Commission on the Status of Women in New York, the anti-feminist Endeavour Forum Inc. hosted a seminar on &quot;Breast Cancer and Reproductive Heath.&quot; It was held at the Church Center, a building for NGOs next to the United Nations. Attendees from every part of the globe listened to a series of scientific-sounding presentations about the ostensible link between abortion and breast cancer (a link that the National Cancer Institute has found to be non-existent). Delegates from Taiwan, Nigeria and other countries, amazed by the information they were hearing, said they would spread the word as soon as they got home. Thus is a lie carried halfway around the world. Few lies have travelled as far and as fast as the paranoid notion of a homosexual lobby bent on corrupting and converting children. Long a staple of American politics, this has lately become an especial obsession of Polish politicians. Poland certainly doesn&apos;t need to import its homophobia - The League of Polish Families, an ultranationalist Catholic Party, is part of the ruling coalition - but the country&apos;s recent anti-gay rhetoric is nearly identical to the stuff heard in the States. In this context, the assault on Tinky Winky seems to confirm the American influence. Right now in Poland, a proposal to ban &quot;homosexual propaganda&quot; in schools is in the works, and vice-minister of education Miroslaw Orzechowski has said, &quot;Teachers who will reveal they are homosexuals will be fired. Such a person cannot work with children.&quot; The European Union has condemned all this, which seems only to have inflamed the country&apos;s homophobes. Speaking at the World Congress of Families, education minister Roman Giertych, head of the League of Polish Families, declared, &quot;The world of permissive attitudes which promote homosexuality, which promote pornography, this world is coming to an end!&quot; With Western Europe dedicated to non-discrimination, the moral support of American conservatives helps bolster the Polish right. &quot;Poland is a country right now attacked because we are defending families,&quot; Marek Yurek, the speaker of Parliament, told the World Congress of Families. &quot;Thanks to your presence, we can feel we are protecting something that is uniting all of us.&quot; Ah, solidarity."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/jun/05/newmicardmemo", "publicationDate": "2007-06-05T11:27:06Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Gadgets", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has come up with a new memory card format called miCard (Multiple Interface Card), which has just been approved by the MultiMediaCard Association.", "However, as EE Times Asia points out: &quot;The main motivation was to get out from underneath royalty payments of 6% for SD cards, of which Taiwan is the No 2 assembler, by promoting a spec that might eventually supersede it in popularity.&quot; Given the volume of cards produced in China and Taiwan, that 6% represents a mountain of cash.", "The EE Times reports:    Working prototypes were unveiled last week in Taiwan and will be on display at the Computex [trade show].", "&quot;When the card is popular enough, so that you see it everywhere in retail, CE vendors have said they will design in a special slot for it,&quot; said Liu Chih-yuan, of Taiwan&apos;s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), which spearheaded the project."], "title": "New miCard memory cards will avoid SD royalty", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) has come up with a new memory card format called miCard (Multiple Interface Card), which has just been approved by the MultiMediaCard Association.

But miCard does have some advantages. One is that it uses fast 16-bit USB protocols where many cards still have 8-bit buses. This should make it easy to design into USB thumb drives. Another is that it uses MMC&apos;s electrical specs so it should be possible to produce cards that fit current card readers. A third is that it can handle lots of memory: ultimately up to 2TB (or 2,048GB) on a card, which should be enough for at least a thousand mp4 movies. However, as EE Times Asia points out: &quot;The main motivation was to get out from underneath royalty payments of 6% for SD cards, of which Taiwan is the No 2 assembler, by promoting a spec that might eventually supersede it in popularity.&quot; Given the volume of cards produced in China and Taiwan, that 6% represents a mountain of cash.

The shift - which was prompted by Costa Rica&apos;s desire to tap into the world&apos;s fastest growing economy - underscores China&apos;s growing muscle in global affairs. Taiwan and China have been tussling for recognition since 1949, when Mao Zedong&apos;s communist forces drove the Kuomintang government across the Strait.  By 1955, only 23 states had established diplomatic relations with Beijing. But with the latest switch, 170 nations now recognise the communist government. Democratic, self-ruled Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen its support dwindle to just 24 mostly small, poor nations. Both sides offer generous incentives for countries to swap allegiances, prompting some to switch more than once. Earlier this year, St Lucia - population 168,000 - moved back into the Taiwan camp, prompting Beijing to immediately withdraw its embassy and cut funding for a cultural centre and psychiatric centre. The long-term trend, however, shows the gravitational pull of the mainland has grown stronger as its economy and trade flows increase at double digit pace. With a population of 4.1 million, Costa Rica is a significant gain for Beijing. The country&apos;s president, Oscar Arias, said the decision was driven by economic considerations. &quot;It is an act of elemental realism,&quot; he told a news conference in San Jos\u00e9.

Breaking one of the state&apos;s strongest political taboos, the obscurely worded advertisement was slipped into the Chengdu Evening News on Monday, the 18th anniversary of the bloody crackdown. Its publication shows how commercialism, ignorance and technology have created chinks in the one-party state&apos;s block on information. The tiny advertisement, on page 14 of the paper, said: &quot;Saluting the strong mothers of victims of 64.&quot; Six-four (June 4) is the most commonly used expression for the crackdown on that day in 1989, when hundreds, possibly thousands, of pro-democracy demonstrators and their supporters were killed by People&apos;s Liberation Army tanks and troops. The government insists the actions were necessary to restore order, but it has blocked all public debate on the issue and continues to hold some of the protesters in prison. Despite, the ban, several mothers of the victims have defiantly called for an open investigation of the killings. But some young Chinese have little or no knowledge of the massacre. According to the South China Morning Post, a young female clerk - responsible for vetting ads in the Chengdu Evening News - allowed the tribute to be published because she was unaware of the significance of 64. When she phoned the person who placed the ad to ask, he reportedly told her it was the date of a mining disaster. The daring message was quickly spotted, scanned and circulated on the internet before the authorities intervened. Copies of the newspaper were withdrawn from kiosks and an investigation team was sent to the paper&apos;s headquarters in Sichuan&apos;s provincial capital. According to Reuters, the deputy editor-in-chief, Li Zhaojun was fired along with two other employees. Staff at the newspaper, which is a 32-page tabloid with a circulation of 200,000, refused to comment when they were contacted by the Guardian.  Free speech campaigners say the editors are being punished to deter others from loosening their guard on the communist party&apos;s information wall.  &quot;It shows the government will do everything to stop any reference to this issue appearing in the media,&quot; said Vincent Brossel of Reporters Without Borders. The censorship is so strong that the young editor had no historical knowledge about June. It shows how the government is trying to remove the memory of the Chinese people.&quot;  Despite economic liberalisation and the increasing commercialisation of the media, the state maintains a tight grip on content. The propaganda department sends out weekly lists of stories that are not allowed to be published or broadcast.  Coverage of contentious topics - such as Tiananmen, Taiwan, Tibet and the outlawed spiritual movement Falun Gong - is either taboo or made to conform to the party line. Scandals involving political leaders and mass protests often never appear in the mainland media. Historical memories are also selective. Sensitive anniversaries - including those for the 1989 massacre, the start of the Cultural Revolution or the anti-rightist campaign - go largely unmentioned.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, however, China jails more reporters than any other country. Reporters Without Borders ranks the country among the 10 worst in the world for press freedom.  The overall picture is more complex. The proliferation of mobile phones and the internet has made it harder to block news. The government has also relaxed controls on coverage of environmental disasters, social inequality and mine accidents. Earlier this year, it eased restrictions on the movements of foreign correspodents.  And the censors occasionally slip up. In 2004, the website of the People&apos;s Daily - the mouthpiece of the communist party - carried a story referring to the &quot;violent crackdown in Beijing&apos;s Tiananmen Square&quot; on the pro-democracy student movement. The lines were at the end of an obituary that had been cut and paste from an article in the Hong Kong media. They were removed after being spotted four hours later.  In 1991, the People&apos;s Daily unwittingly propagated subliminal sedition by publishing a poem, which - if read diagonally - contained a coded call for then prime minister Li Peng to step down. Li - dubbed the &quot;Butcher of Beijing&quot; by his enemies - is among the most reviled figures in recent Chinese history because he ordered martial law in 1989."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/08/ethicalliving.familyandrelationships", "publicationDate": "2007-06-08T12:03:14Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Ethical and green living", "Family", "Business", "Life and style", "Pollution", "Recycling", "UK news", "Marks & Spencer"], "sentences": ["The recycling process behind M&amp;S&apos;s range takes place in Taiwan and the 100% recycled polyester is made from bottles that have been sourced locally."], "title": "M&S, BHS go green for school wear", "article": "After several years of competing on price, high-street stores have gone green in their battle to attract parents looking to buy next year&apos;s school uniforms. This week, Marks &amp; Spencer and British Home Stores announced they would each be selling a range of schoolwear made from recycled plastic bottles. The bottles have been chopped up into flakes, melted and then made into a polyester yarn, which is woven into cloth. The end result is a range of fleeces, polo shirts, trousers and skirts that will go on sale in the summer, and apparently don&apos;t melt under an iron. The recycling process behind M&amp;S&apos;s range takes place in Taiwan and the 100% recycled polyester is made from bottles that have been sourced locally. An average of seven bottles is needed to produce each child&apos;s fleece. A spokeswoman for M&amp;S said that recycled polyester was hard to source and as a result prices for the clothes were &quot;slightly higher&quot; than for the rest of the retailer&apos;s school range. However, with a polo shirt costing from \u00a33, and for the youngest children, a whole uniform available for less than \u00a320, the recycled fabric uniforms are not prohibitively expensive. The range will be on sale from August in 20 stores around the country and on the retailer&apos;s website. It also includes Fairtrade cotton shirts for girls and boys aged between three and 16. The move to use recycled polyester is part of M&amp;S&apos;s Plan A commitment to ensuring materials are sourced sustainable and follows the launch of a men&apos;s fleece made with the same fabric. Julian Kilmartin, the director of menswear and boyswear, said: &quot;We&apos;re constantly looking at ways to give our customers the most innovative, best value and highest quality schoolwear on the high street. &quot;Using recycled polyester is another way that we&apos;re doing this.&quot; Mr Kilmartin added that the polyester was of the same quality as that used in the rest of M&amp;S&apos;s schoolwear range. BHS&apos;s range is priced from \u00a33.50 for a polo shirt and from \u00a37 for fleeces and trousers. It is using plastic bottles collected in Europe and says it takes 10 bottles to make its &quot;greenfleece&quot;. Fabric made from 100% recycled polyester has been used for years in the outdoor clothing market. The American firm, Patagonia, has used recycled and recyclable polyester in fleeces since 1993. It estimates that by last year it had saved 92m plastic bottles from landfill sites and incinerators. The school uniform market has been competitive in recent years, with retailers trying to undercut each other on prices. But last month, the production of Asda&apos;s sub-\u00a310 uniform was called into question by anti-poverty campaigners, who said the low price suggested workers were being exploited. Asda insisted its George uniform was &quot;ethically&quot; sourced from factories that were regularly audited. But War on Want said it feared cheap labour was being used to make the garments."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/china.jonathanwatts", "publicationDate": "2007-06-08T22:16:57Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Costa Rica", "Taiwan", "Americas", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China edged closer to victory in its 58-year-long diplomatic arm wrestle with Taiwan yesterday, as it emerged that Costa Rica had switched allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.", "Taiwan and China have been tussling for recognition since 1949, when Mao Zedong&apos;s communist forces drove the Kuomintang government across the Strait.", "Democratic, self-ruled Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen its support dwindle to 24 - mostly small and poor - nations.", "Earlier this year, St Lucia - population 168,000 - moved back into the Taiwan camp, prompting Beijing to withdraw its embassy and cut funding for a cultural centre and psychiatric centre.", "Taiwan&apos;s foreign minister, James Huang, offered to resign over the loss of another ally."], "title": "Victory for China as Costa Rica cuts Taiwan ties", "article": "China edged closer to victory in its 58-year-long diplomatic arm wrestle with Taiwan yesterday, as it emerged that Costa Rica had switched allegiance from Taipei to Beijing. The shift - prompted by Costa Rica&apos;s desire to tap into the world&apos;s fastest growing economy - underscores the growing muscle of China in global affairs. Taiwan and China have been tussling for recognition since 1949, when Mao Zedong&apos;s communist forces drove the Kuomintang government across the Strait. By 1955 only 23 states had established diplomatic relations with Beijing. But with the latest switch, 170 nations now recognise the communist government. Democratic, self-ruled Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen its support dwindle to 24 - mostly small and poor - nations. Both sides offer generous incentives for countries to swap allegiance, prompting some to switch more than once. Earlier this year, St Lucia - population 168,000 - moved back into the Taiwan camp, prompting Beijing to withdraw its embassy and cut funding for a cultural centre and psychiatric centre.

They ask someone, &quot;How can you tell when people are lying?&quot;, then follow this up with 10 simple questions about liars. Here are the questions: \u00b7 Do liars act calm, nervous, or neither calm nor nervous? \u00b7 Do liars act silly, serious, or neither silly nor serious? \u00b7 Are their stories more consistent than usual, less consistent, or neither? \u00b7 Are their stories longer than usual, shorter, or neither? \u00b7 Before liars answer questions, do they pause longer than usual, shorter, or neither? \u00b7 Do liars stutter more than usual, less, or neither? \u00b7 Do liars shift their posture more than usual, less, or neither? \u00b7 Do liars look at the other person&apos;s eyes more than usual, less, or neither? \u00b7 Do liars touch and scratch themselves more than usual, less, or neither? \u00b7 Do liars use hand gestures more than usual, less, or neither? They asked these questions in 75 countries: China, Colombia, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Korea, Kuwait, Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, Morocco, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Samoa, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the UK and the US. The Global Deception Research Team compiled and analysed the answers. Here is their pithy distillation: &quot;[There are] common stereo-types about the liar, and these should not be ignored. Liars shift their posture, they touch and scratch themselves, liars are nervous, and their speech is flawed. These beliefs are common across the globe. Yet in prevalence, these stereotypes are dwarfed by the most common belief about liars: &apos;they can&apos;t look you in the eye&apos;.&quot; That is their great discovery. And it accords with previous discoveries by other researchers. The team prepared for its work by studying 32 earlier studies about lying. A 1981 survey of Americans, they say, found the widespread belief that &quot;liars avert gaze, touch themselves, move their feet and legs, shift their posture, shrug, and speak quickly&quot;. A 1996 survey of Britons revealed the general opinion that &quot;liars reduce eye contact, turn away, blink, and pause while giving inconsistent, implausible stories&quot;. Of these and other nations&apos; beliefs, the Global Deception Research Team says: &quot;These beliefs are probably inaccurate.&quot; It is well established, they say, that people show little ability to detect when somebody is lying. The Global Deception Research Team did not ask whether the people who answered their survey were lying. The reader may presume that the researchers presume that, when people answer surveys, they tell the truth. \u00b7 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly magazine Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/13/simontisdall.international", "publicationDate": "2007-06-13T22:50:27Z", "tags": ["World news", "US national security"], "sentences": ["Beijing&apos;s short-term focus was &quot;military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait&quot;, it said.", "The report also warned that Taiwan, which Beijing deems a renegade territory but whose de facto independence is implicitly underwritten by the US, remained the most likely flashpoint.", "While Taiwan was also increasing its defence spending, presidential elections due in Taipei next March could further exacerbate bilateral strains.", "Taiwanese officials recently denied they were planning to acquire medium-range missiles or weapons of mass destruction but internal political divisions continue over how best to deter China.", "Western and Taiwanese analysts say China&apos;s emerging Taiwan strategy is to deter US military intervention in a future conflict by keeping US aircraft carrier groups at bay, far out in the western Pacific, principally through the use of missile submarines - the policy of &quot;area denial&quot;."], "title": "Simon Tisdall: Pentagon report chills  US-China relations", "article": "Even as the US struggles to stop relations with Russia plunging into deep freeze, a distinct chill has descended over its dealings with Beijing following a new Pentagon report on China&apos;s military build-up.

One could only pause sadly at one writer&apos;s observation that, in virtually any African capital, one can easily pick up bootleg DVDs of Pirates of the Caribbean or Ocean&apos;s 13 - but not of important African filmmakers such as Semb\u00e8ne or Souleymane Ciss\u00e9 or Idrissa Ouedraogo. It&apos;s not quite the picture one expects, somehow. Though their works typically go unexhibited in the English-speaking world, we like to imagine our favourite foreign filmmakers as national heroes, not as prophets without honour. Nevertheless, it is the case - and for this, the world of film festivals must assume some responsibility. The notion of selection is by definition exclusive, and cleaving as it does to arthouse rather than commercial filmmaking, leads to some serious misrepresentations of what a national film culture actually is. For example, a coterie of US film critics, largely based around the Village Voice, the Chicago Reader and Film Comment, and a long list of festival programmers, have long proclaimed Taiwan&apos;s Hou Hsiao-hsien the &quot;greatest living narrative filmmaker&quot;. This means little to the vast majority of American filmmakers, since virtually none of his eighteen features have had a theatrical release in the US - but perhaps more surprisingly, it also means almost nothing to the vast majority of Taiwanese, to whom he is a name and little more. His films are by no means national events; most play in Taipei for a week or two, on a couple of arthouse screens, to small audiences, and that is all. Likewise his younger (and, I think, lesser) compatriot Tsai Ming-liang - feted on the festival circuit, garlanded with awards and reverence. Yet his international renown remains a source of bafflement to his fellow Taiwanese. Given this disregard, it&apos;s no coincidence that each filmmaker has been forced to look internationally for financing - Hou to Japan and, more recently, to France; Tsai to Malaysia (he is Malaysian-Chinese) and, yes, the dependable French. One could say the same of South Korea&apos;s Im Kwon-taek - another eminence grise, having just racked up his 100th feature film, and who became something of a favourite at Cannes during the 1990s, becoming the first South Korean director ever in competition there. Domestically, though, his films have bombed - this latest, titled Across The Years, being no exception. Or Iran&apos;s Abbas Kiarostami, indisputably one of the greatest living directors - yet badly overshadowed, at home, by his country&apos;s thriving commercial sector, by locally-made comedies and dramas as noisy, melodramatic and insubstantial, as his films are quiet, understated and profound. But festivals would lead you to believe, not only that he exists at the heart of Iranian cinema, but that, apart from him and a few other directors (Jafar Panahi, Mohsen and Samira Makhmalbaf), no Iranian film industry exists. All this bespeaks a greater problem. The time when leading arthouse filmmakers - a Fellini, say, or a Bergman - also commanded a broader commercial audience, outside of festivals, has passed. This coincides with the movement of so-called &quot;serious filmmaking&quot; from the centre of the cultural debate, to its periphery. In the 1960s, to swim in the cultural waters, to be part of a certain class of society, inevitably meant being familiar with the latest Godard - in much the same way one read the new Philip Roth novel, or visited the latest Joseph Beuys or Nam June Paik show; likewise, in the 1970s, with Fassbinder (a popular filmmaker, both at home and abroad) or Herzog. But those days, alas, are no more. It&apos;s hard not to feel depressed by this. Those of us who watched and loved Semb\u00e8ne&apos;s films, preferred to believe that they were as well-loved, as instructive, as useful to African viewers, as to ourselves. We were of course mistaken. What is most common around the world, it seems, is a simple lack of effort: humans, by and large, want only the easiest, most readily-available and easily-digestible forms of entertainment. And that is provided by the dominant culture - in filmic terms, by Hollywood. This is not, of course, to imply that this is right. Semb\u00e8ne&apos;s works, so humane and insightful, should be seen by everyone who was interested, not only in cinema, but in life. But they will not be. Most aren&apos;t even available on DVD.

It&apos;s not the only example of a new CE machine. The same site has a story headed Clearview XL43 calls itself world&apos;s smallest, most versatile UMPC, which also runs Windows CE, and there&apos;s the similar Cowon Q5. The problem with these devices is that the idea has been tried and failed. The background is that after Windows took off in the early 1990s, Microsoft figured that the Intel x86 chip set would not go down to low end devices (too much power, too much heat, and too expensive). It sat down and created a whole new operating system -- Windows CE -- that initially didn&apos;t run on the x86 platform, but would make Windows-style software development available in the world of embedded processors. In other words, Consumer Electronics, even though Microsoft denies CE stands for that. Windows CE appeared a decade ago and was used in a wide range of products from PDAs (PocketPCs), games consoles (Sega Dreamcast) and mobile phones (eg HTC) to cars. However, the small format CE-based handheld and notebook computers -- such as the Compaq Aero 8000 -- were never a success. The message from the marketplace seemed to be that users wanted to run full Windows software on notebooks, not the CE version. The latest industry effort, exemplified by Microsoft&apos;s Origami/UMPC project, is to develop full Windows PCs with 7inch or smaller screens -- one of the markets for which CE was developed. This has been made possible by ultra-low-power versions of x86 chips from Via Technologies and Intel. These certainly reduce the problems with heat and power consumption, but manufacturers have yet to deliver attractive PC-based devices at CE-style prices. (Microsoft&apos;s Origami had nothing to do with pushing technology development, and everything to do with trying to create a Tablet PC form factor that could be sold for $500.) What could be happening now is that the UMPC push is giving CE-based devices another chance, with Compal&apos;s machine being one example. This time it could succeed for two reasons. First, it could be presented as a device that is scaled up, rather than scaled down. In other words, you can think of it as being a more powerful handheld computer/mobile device, rather than as a cut-down notebook PC. Some HTC products clearly fit into this category. Second, it&apos;s much more possible to work on the web today than it was in 1997, and this should make the operating system much less important. Instead of needing an x86 platform to carry around your desktop Windows applications, you just need to be able to access Web-based applications. This seems to me to be a pretty clear trend, and of course, Windows CE is far from being the only option. Symbian, Palm and Linux are among the options competing for the same space. Nobody knows how this particular round will turn out, but I&apos;m not sure it matters. Users who want to run Web-apps will have more options, and users who want XP or Vista on the go will have more options. The Web-apps device isn&apos;t going away, because it&apos;s an extension of the mobile phone market. The ultramobile PC platform isn&apos;t going away because Windows dominates the desktop and notebook markets. Neither type of system has to stand on its own, so fans from both camps can happily choose whichever they like."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/jun/16/dance", "publicationDate": "2007-06-15T23:02:17Z", "tags": ["Cloud Gate Dance Theatre", "Dance", "Culture", "Stage", "Matthew Bourne"], "sentences": ["Cloud Gate Dance Theatre Of Taiwan: Wild CursiveLondon Cloud Gate are the original fusion company, rooted in choreographer Lin Hwai-Min&apos;s long background in western contemporary dance, oriental martial arts and Chinese opera."], "title": "Dance preview: June 16-22", "article": "Cloud Gate Dance Theatre Of Taiwan: Wild CursiveLondon Cloud Gate are the original fusion company, rooted in choreographer Lin Hwai-Min&apos;s long background in western contemporary dance, oriental martial arts and Chinese opera.

The show had entranced 300 million viewers for an hour every Sunday for 20 months on the country&apos;s only TV station at the time, state-owned broadcaster Doordarshan. No programme since has matched that size of audience (partly because there are now 160 channels) and today&apos;s viewers prefer &quot;pop idols&quot; to ones found in temples: 30 million tuned into Indian Idol when it launched a couple of years ago. More than 110 million homes in the country now have television - more than half are connected by cable and about 7 million have satellite dishes. The most popular shows remain soap operas, especially those that revolve around the tensions between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in Indian homes. Rupert Murdoch&apos;s Star channel has made its reputation on such &quot;Saas-Bahu&quot; soaps, and remains India&apos;s most-watched broadcaster. Western television has slowly made inroads into India: Desperate Housewives, Spooks, even The Vicar Of Dibley can be seen on the small screen. This year&apos;s water-cooler TV event was the budding friendship between a beautiful model and an actor best known for rustic roles in Bigg Boss, the Indian version of Celebrity Big Brother. India remains a poor country, and not every household has a television, yet the gap is closing. The big problem is that budgets are small and competition for audiences is cut-throat - which means less opportunity for &quot;quality programming&quot;. That may be changing, though - Karan Johar, a Bollywood director who made his name with big show productions, has joined with a news broadcaster to launch a new entertainment channel later this year. Randeep Ramesh US For a nation spoilt for choice between hundreds of channels, it&apos;s amazing that Americans still have so much in common in their viewing habits. They just can&apos;t get enough of reality TV. Of the top 10 places for most popular shows, as rated by Nielsen Media Research, six are occupied by various nights of American Idol and Dancing With The Stars, with up to 30 million people watching them live or recorded that day. Having said that, the delightful communality of vegging out in front of the TV in the knowledge that millions of others are doing the same is inevitably fading away, as the plethora of options - not least internet viewing and TV clips on YouTube - fragments the audience. The top four networks recently recorded plummeting ratings, with 2.5 million fewer people watching their shows at prime time than in the previous year. You can see the drift over time. In 1983, for instance, the most-watched programme of the year - a M*A*S*H special - captured 60% of the US TV audience, with 50 million households viewing it. The showstopper this year so far has been the Super Bowl, which enjoyed a similar viewership of 48 million, but attracted only 43% of America&apos;s by now much larger audience of 111 million TV households. It is hard to believe now, but the investigative 60 Minutes was the most popular programme in 1980, attracting 28% of the total audience. Compare that with American Idol, today&apos;s favourite, which pulls in just 17%. The three main networks, CBS, ABC and NBC, continue to be major players in that order, but the big change has been the increasing threat of Rupert Murdoch&apos;s Fox, which as the provider of American Idol puts out the most popular show in US television and whose average audience has now overtaken the ailing NBC. The appalling frequency of adverts in US television continues to drive people to TiVo and gloriously ad-free pay television, notably HBO, which is certain to have the water-cooler moment of the year: the final part of the final series of the Sopranos. What variety of sticky end befalls Tony already has TV addicts jittering. Ed Pilkington Mexico Mexican television is dominated by two private networks - Televisa and TV Azteca - although there is growing pressure for more competition. Some 10% of viewers watch the two state-owned educational channels; cable/satellite services are too expensive for most, while digital competition (and developments) are limited by lack of internet access in the majority of homes. Traditional time slot-driven television is the main source of entertainment and news for most Mexicans, despite frequent complaints about quality. The primetime backbone is the telenovela. Classic formats involve largely white and one-dimensional villains and heroes, accompanied by loyal, dark-skinned servants. More complex and sophisticated plots are now creeping in. One of these - the Mexican version of Ugly Betty, screened last year - was phenomenally successful, with the finale garnering the country&apos;s third biggest audience ever (after an international football final involving Mexico, and a celebrity wedding). More than 100,000 gathered to cheer the newlywed fictitious heroine and her beau. Also last year, presidential elections triggered a very popular, and unprecedented, political satire show on Televisa, The Privilege Of Governing. This year, the same network has launched a new line in home-grown series modelled on US successes such as Desperate Housewives. Mexicans soon tired of a particularly tame Big Brother, but have shown more enthusiasm for the singing and dancing reality formats. Jo Tuckman China When it comes to the world&apos;s biggest TV ratings phenomena, you can forget Pop Idol, Big Brother and The Apprentice. The World Cup Final, the Olympics and the Super Bowl may briefly blip into the global consciousness, but they have no staying power. Coronation Street has longevity, but its numbers just don&apos;t compare. No, the real ratings champion of global television is surely the 7.30pm weather forecast on China Central Television&apos;s (CCTV) channel one: rain or shine, the programme claims an average daily audience of 300m - equivalent to the entire US population. That is the boast of CCTV, the state-run broadcaster that, in terms of market share and political clout, dominates the world&apos;s most populous nation. CCTV is a propaganda arm of the ruling Communist party. The weather follows the 7pm news programme, which is compulsorily relayed by every provincial station because it sets the national agenda. Most broadcasts start with the activities of senior Communist officials - the order of their appearance strictly determined by their rank within the party. But while that aspect of TV in China still fits the turgid, old-fashioned stereotype of a communist nation, there are intriguing developments in viewing habits that better reflect this fast-changing nation. The hottest programme in 2005 was Super Girl Voice - a Chinese version of Pop Idol - produced by Hunan TV and sponsored by Mongolian Cow Sour Yogurt. Just as in its British and US counterparts, viewers were able to vote for their favourite performers via text messaging. This was a revelation in a nation where people do not have the chance to choose their political leaders. At the climax of the first series in 2005, 280 million people tuned in to the final and 8 million cast a vote. The winner was Li Yuchun, an androgynous singer with spiky hair and a husky voice. The show was so popular and sparked so many imitators that the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television became worried it was having a detrimental effect on society (and, no doubt, the one-party political system). It issued new restrictions on voting for such shows, and limited each series to a maximum of 10 weeks. In the early 80s, there were only 20 TV sets - many of them black-and-white - for every 100 households, so many families used to gather in one place to watch popular shows. By 2005, however, there were 30% more sets than families, so such shared viewing has become a thing of the past. There is also more programming. Twenty-four-hour broadcasts are now the norm in many cities, with provincial channels producing more of their own material, rather than just using CCTV feeds and reruns of approved films. Content is still heavily censored, but network bosses are under commercial pressure to be bolder because information is more freely available in other forms of media. Since 1997, the number of TV viewers has remained flat, despite an increase of tens of millions in the population. Internet penetration, however, has surged to more than 150 million. Many families also ignore the law by buying satellite dishes so they can watch banned broadcasts from Taiwan. Students download them from the internet. The motive is not usually political: Taiwan&apos;s dramas and pop shows are extremely popular on the mainland. Jonathan Watts Morocco For Moroccans, the pan-Arab Super Star talent show was, if not this year&apos;s water-cooler moment, then at least the hottest thing to discuss over a glass of green tea. The show was already a hit in Morocco before a tearful Iraqi, Shada Hassoun, won the competition in March. Moroccans eagerly watch not just the finals but also the regional preliminary competitions. This year they are sending three finalists, led by Saad Al Mjarad, to the Beirut-based show. Although Morocco has two state-controlled channels, TVM and 2M, it is satellite television from elsewhere that has revolutionised viewing habits here. Be they open-to-air Arab channels such as Al-Jazeera and Saudi Arabia&apos;s Iqra, or Spanish channels decoded by pirated cards, satellite is increasingly watched at home or at the open-air cafes where men gather to smoke and chat. Spanish football, Egyptian soaps and television preachers, and Lebanese gameshows are all part of the regular Moroccan television diet. Al-Jazeera&apos;s 10pm Maghreb news show - refreshingly free of saturation coverage of Morocco&apos;s King Mohammed VI - has, for example, knocked the rankings of local royal-kowtowing news shows. Amr Khalid, a TV preacher from Egypt, is a household name who is beamed in by Saudi-owned Iqra TV. As a result, state-controlled terrestrial television has had to improve its act. French-speaking 2M may still start the day with a reading from the Qur&apos;an, but it also imports soaps and has Champions League football. Even the more conservative TVM now has several soaps a day. State television buys in European league football, though it has recently been unable to meet the prices set for Real Madrid and Barcelona matches - which divide Moroccans as much as they do Spaniards. Moroccans still have to turn to Spanish satellite channels for that. Giles Tremlett Lithuania It&apos;s Mantas, really, who has been the TV sensation of the year in Lithuania. The budding pop singer won Lithuania Dancing Ten, the Baltic state&apos;s version of Celebrity Come Dancing, and then instantly morphed into the country&apos;s heart-throb. The post-communist country of 3.5 million boasts one to two TV sets in each of its 1.5 million households. Satellite dishes are sprouting from the sides of the drab, Soviet-era housing blocks and the lovely old Hanseatic apartments of the capital, Vilnius. Cable packages are also popular. So, as everywhere else in Europe, viewing habits are far more fractured than they used to be, with people watching non-terrestrial Russian or Scandinavian channels, as well as stuff such as BBC World, CNN and Discovery. The dancing spectacular was a triumph for the national public broadcaster, which has two channels competing fiercely with three commercial channels. Top ratings are generally shared by two of the commercial channels, LNK and TV3. The epidemic of reality TV programmes and Big Brother copycats is currently attracting most viewers, as is the local version of Pop Idol. For the one-off TV event, however, the Eurovision Song Contest still reigns supreme. And in a country where basketball is the national religion, anything involving a slam-dunk is guaranteed to boost ratings. Ian Traynor Nigeria The Nigerian government would prefer that the tens of millions who crowd in front of televisions to watch the fourth largest network in the world every evening were drawing cultural lessons from the official programming about the common values of Africa&apos;s most populous but divided nation. But, as in much of the continent, Nigerians rely on a diet of football, religion and soap operas for most of their entertainment - although the order of preference is very much determined by geography. Saucy soap operas are kept off many of the local television stations in the overwhelmingly Muslim north, where religious broadcasts from the Qur&apos;an and preachers acceptable to the government are a staple. In the mostly Christian south, the tangled pursuit of sex, money and power in the soaps - local and Latin American - sits comfortably alongside the praising of God. Television in the south is packed with Pentecostal services and preachers promising to cure the sick or make the poor rich. Three years ago the government banned religious broadcasters from showing on television miracles that are not &quot;provable and believable&quot;. Religious broadcasting is popular not only with the audiences but with the mass of local television stations that rely on it as a leading source of income. Football unifies where other popular programmes divide. The ups and downs of Nigeria&apos;s football team provide sporadic hope in a country where it is often in short supply. But it is the English Premiership that has many on the edge of their seats each week. Chris McGreal Britain When I made a documentary looking back at British television from the 60s, greying witnesses recalled eerie evening silences on city streets, occasionally broken by the hurrying footsteps of a last tardy commuter rushing home to be in front of the set in time for The Prisoner, The Morecambe &amp; Wise Show or The Wednesday Play. Time romanticises memories, but that vision of viewing holds some truth. With two channels and no video recorders, watching television was of necessity a shared experience. Now, the reception of even a hit show is fragmented and elongated. You won&apos;t see workers dashing through empty streets to catch Little Britain or Life On Mars because one section of the audience has recorded it, another is waiting for the box-set of DVDs and a third may even be watching it on a laptop or, soon, a mobile phone. A useful symbol of how consumption of the medium has changed is the relationship between the TV industry and the pub. Forty years ago, a standard expression of a show&apos;s success was that it emptied the Dog &amp; Duck. Now, a big England football or rugby game is more likely to fill the Slug &amp; Lettuce, as games increasingly migrate to non-terrestrial channels, forcing old technology viewers, against all historical instinct, to leave the house when there&apos;s something good on TV. This expansion of viewing options has inevitably led to a contraction in television&apos;s national importance. In the past, a top-rating show would have been watched by half the nation. Now, The Apprentice or Life On Mars can get regular coverage in every shade of newspaper from the FT to the Sun, despite being seen by barely 10% of the population. Whereas British TV was once like stadium rock, it now more resembles a series of small, underground venues. An average 54,000 viewers a day watch Baby-TV, while 3,000 tune in to the Business Channel. But, though now solitary rather than communal, viewing remains addictive - the average Briton still watches 23 hours and 56 minutes a week. Mark Lawson France The odd thing about French television is that it is so unremittingly awful. Inane game shows, insipid documentaries, unincisive interviews, irrelevant dramas, incredibly lame cop series that the French have known since (literally) 1976, unbelievably dreadful four-hour Saturday night song-and-dance spectaculars presented by a bloke called Arthur and composed exclusively of cringe-worthy covers of Gallic hits of the 70s - c&apos;est un vrai festival. The problem is that the medium itself is not considered suitable for serious endeavour. It&apos;s a historico-cultural thing: TV was a state monopoly, and often a government mouthpiece, until as late as the mid-80s. And in France the real talent has always headed for the cinema anyway. Once every couple of years, there&apos;s a halfway decent contemporary drama, but the French would never dare, for example, take on a docudrama about contemporary political figures/events. The most-watched TV programme in France this year will undoubtedly be the Sarko-S\u00e9go debate before the second round of the presidential election, which attracted 20.5 million viewers. By way of comparison, last year&apos;s top programme was France v Italy in the World Cup final, which drew 22.2 million. Outside football matches, the most-watched programmes of 2006 were films (headed by 70s cult French comedy classics Les Bronz\u00e9s and Les Bronz\u00e9s Font Du Ski, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Les Choristes and Asterix), all of which pulled in around 12 million; followed by a two-part costume drama about a celebrated postwar murder case in which a woman was accused of poisoning her husband (11 million). To protect the &quot;audiovisual industry&quot;, there are rules about the amount of domestic programming that must be shown, but they don&apos;t stop French telly importing a lot of American and even a few British programmes. CSI is huge at the moment, though ancient French cop series do just as well, with Julie Lescaut (created 1992), Navarro (1989) and Commissaire Moulin (1976) taking up most of the rest of the top 100, with audiences of 10 million-plus.Jon Henley"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jun/17/usnews.theobserver", "publicationDate": "2007-06-17T00:10:40Z", "tags": ["Business", "US news", "World news"], "sentences": ["&apos;If you look now, imports of manufactured goods from the third world as a share of GDP are about 2.5 times what they were then; we have got some new forms of globalisation - services outsourcing - and we&apos;ve shifted from doing a lot of trade with South Korea and Taiwan, which at that time had wages that were 25 per cent of the US level, to doing a lot of trade with China, where wages are 3.5 per cent of the US level."], "title": "Mammon: Paul Krugman, economist", "article": "Paul Krugman is the noisiest - and angriest - member of a rare and surprisingly dangerous species: the economist-at-large. The New York Times columnist, best-selling author and scourge of the Bush White House, has turned his number-crunching craft to devastating effect. Holed up in a stuffy book-lined office at the London School of Economics, bearded Krugman looks every inch the fifty-something Princeton professor he is. He is polishing his lecture for the next day, in between finalising arrangements for a cycling holiday in Sicily. His academic research on economies of scale and on the causes of the Asian financial crises of the late Nineties is still regarded as ground-breaking. Yet he has wandered far from his Ivy League tower. With his twice-weekly columns for the New York Times, Krugman has intervened furiously over Iraq, George Bush&apos;s tax cuts, immigration and a host of other prickly political issues. He has joined a tiny field of celebrity economists - along with ex-Bill Clinton adviser Joseph Stiglitz, and anti-poverty campaigner Jeffrey Sachs - who throw themselves into public debate. Krugman insists that he didn&apos;t set out to be an economist provocateur. &apos;It&apos;s an accident: the Times hired me to write about the economy. I came in and soon realised that the political situation was much more dire and that people were not really reporting it - that Bush was lying through his teeth and no one seemed to care.&apos; For the first time in years, though, he&apos;s feeling optimistic: with a Democrat majority in Congress, he has great hopes of a &apos;progressive consensus&apos; to deliver radical reform to America&apos;s health and welfare systems. &apos;If the Democrats do this right, George Bush could be the Herbert Hoover of the 21st century.&apos; [Hoover&apos;s failure to alleviate the suffering of the Great Depression - he was notorious for telling reporters, &apos;no one is actually starving&apos; - helped usher in the New Deal administration of Franklin D Roosevelt, the closest the US has ever come to a welfare state.] Fixing the patchy health system, which leaves 45 million workers without medical insurance, will be a key issue at next year&apos;s presidential elections, Krugman believes. &apos;The employer-based insurance system is unravelling, so we have a felt need: the political constellation is as good as it has been in the past 60 years. But I also know the history of the US: we almost fix it and fall short.&apos; He is &apos;goading&apos; Hillary Clinton to come up with detailed healthcare proposals. &apos;I&apos;m quite concerned about the absence of a plan from Hillary Clinton.&apos; Krugman was in London last week to deliver a speech about &apos;globalisation and welfare&apos;. In the week that angry US Senators threatened to slap punitive tariffs on what they say are unfair Chinese exports, he warns that facing down the anti-globalisers is not as easy as it used to be. &apos;It&apos;s not an abstract question. When I think of this question, I think: what do I say to Senator Brown of Ohio?&apos; [Sherrod Brown, recently sworn in as a Democratic Senator after sitting as a Congressman for more than a decade, has watched hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs being lost in his home state, and blames outsourcing to low-cost economies such as China and India.] &apos;I share his values,&apos; Krugman says. &apos;It&apos;s not stupid to be worried about the impact of globalisation.&apos; Back in the mid-Nineties, Krugman was among a group of academics who calculated the costs of globalisation for American workers, and found they were low. Today, he believes the picture is different - and it&apos;s harder than ever for free traders to win the argument. &apos;If you look now, imports of manufactured goods from the third world as a share of GDP are about 2.5 times what they were then; we have got some new forms of globalisation - services outsourcing - and we&apos;ve shifted from doing a lot of trade with South Korea and Taiwan, which at that time had wages that were 25 per cent of the US level, to doing a lot of trade with China, where wages are 3.5 per cent of the US level. Those models are now going to say there&apos;s a bigger effect.&apos; Today, Krugman accepts that wages for low-income workers are being squeezed by cheap imports and outsourcing. &apos;The rhetoric from economists is that the people who lose from free trade tend to be small, well-organised groups, and the winners are more widely spread. But now you can make the case in the US that the losers are anyone with less than 14 years of education, and the winners would be those with a full college degree. Overall there&apos;s still a benefit to the US - but since the winners don&apos;t compensate the losers, what do I say to Senator Brown?&apos; Political support for globalisation will depend on the winners - the highly-skilled, highly educated workers not yet competing with their Indian or Chinese counterparts - helping those who lose out. &apos;I don&apos;t have answers. In the US context, it&apos;s a better social security system, and more progressive taxation, so the winners compensate the losers.&apos; But over the past decade the rich have got richer, while average income has been flat in real terms for the past five years. &apos;At this point, the pre-tax and transfer income distribution is exactly back to where it was in the 1920s. We are back to the gilded age of inequality,&apos; Krugman says. &apos;Gordon Gekko won.&apos; He argues that rising inequality has polarised US politics: and the UK, with its soaring top-end salaries, should beware of following the pattern. &apos;Inequality is the core of what I&apos;m worried about. The top tier in the UK is pulling away in ways reminiscent of the US. We have had a powerful, well-organised political movement doing its best to roll back the New Deal. We&apos;ve got a detached wealthy class. There&apos;s been a clear association between rising inequality and political polarisation.&apos; He would like to see more progressive taxation, and better use of the &apos;earned income tax credit&apos; - the scheme copied by Gordon Brown in designing his own tax credits. &apos;This is an enormously successful programme, with amounts of money that are small. That could be much better. We could target it so that the class of workers who are hurt by globalisation would reap the benefits.&apos; Krugman will tackle some of these issues in his book, The Conscience of a Liberal, to be published in the autumn, in good time for the presidential campaign. As a New York Times columnist, he is forbidden to endorse a particular candidate in the primaries. But he has plenty to say about them. He&apos;s concerned that Barack Obama may be too conciliatory: &apos;My concern is that he talks about, &quot;why does our politics have to be so harsh?&quot; There&apos;s a reason for that: we actually have severe class conflict in the US, and that ends up being reflected in the political scene.&apos; Krugman admits he&apos;s not a close follower of British politics: &apos;When I would write about something overseas, I would get emails from loyal readers saying, &quot;please go back to bashing Bush&quot;.&apos; But he says Labour&apos;s reforms over the past decade could provide a model for a Democrat President. &apos;I&apos;m paying more attention now, because in some respects, if it wasn&apos;t for Iraq, the Blair years would be a prototype for what a progressive government could try to do.

Standard, which plans to increase the number of its private bankers to 450 from 150 in three years, believes that wealthy individuals in Asia and the Middle East want different services from their counterparts in the west. They prefer to invest in domestic markets, whereas private banking in the US and Europe is often based around offshore investment. Wealthy Asians tend to hold a high proportion of their assets in cash, compared with Americans and Europeans who seek higher returns on the stock market. The London operation will target customers of Asian, Middle Eastern and African origin who are based here but retain ties with their country of origin.

The two crises have nothing in common, but their resolution will depend on whether these two permanent members of the UN security council use their veto power. Comparing the respective abilities of Russia and China to block key international initiatives makes no sense in itself, but it does constitute a useful tool for understanding the transformation of the international system that is now underway as a consequence of the relative decline of America&apos;s global power. But the deepening Middle East chaos poses both opportunities and risks for Russia and China, which may force them to define the roles they want to play and the images they want to project in the world. Superficially, Russia and China give the impression that they are pursuing the same path when they both proclaim with pride that they are &quot;back&quot; on the world stage. But this boast means different things for each country. For China, a deeply self-confident country, to be &quot;back&quot; simply means regaining the country&apos;s historical centrality in the world after an absence of more than two centuries. After all, at the end of the 18th century, China became the world&apos;s first producer of manufactured goods, and it perceives itself as a centre of civilization unequalled by any other in Asia, if not the world. China&apos;s renewed self-confidence is based on its remarkable economic prowess, which is derived not from natural resources, but from productivity and creativity. Whatever huge political, social, and economic tensions may exist, there is a &quot;feel good&quot; factor in China, a sense of progress, with the 2008 Olympics in Beijing figuring as the symbolic moment that will proclaim to the world the scale of the country&apos;s achievements. Above all, with the exception of the Taiwan issue, China is a satisfied status quo power when it comes to the evolution of the international system - a patient actor that finds it perfectly legitimate to behave and to be seen as the world&apos;s number two power. By contrast, Russians remain insecure about their status in the world. Russia&apos;s explosive &quot;revisionist&quot; behaviour on the eve of the recent G8 summit is an indication of the Kremlin&apos;s &quot;unsatisfied&quot; nature. Because they know they are less potent, particularly in demographic and economic terms, Russians feel they have to do &quot;more.&quot; For them, to say &quot;Russia is back&quot; means that the humiliating Yeltsin years are over, and that they now must be treated as equals, particularly by the United States. That claim is not necessarily supported by reality. Unlike the Chinese, the Russians do not create economic wealth, but merely exploit their energy and mineral resources. Moreover, unlike the Chinese, they have not always been confident of their position in the world. Torn between Europe and Asia in cultural and political terms, victimised by a dark, narcissistic instinct that pervades their reading of their past and their visions of the future, it should surprise no one that Russia is now behaving like a &quot;revisionist&quot; power. Less than 20 years ago, the Czech Republic and Poland were part of their sphere of influence, so Russians understandably cannot accept the US unilaterally implanting its security system there. But the differences between Russia and China today may prove to be less significant tomorrow if the deterioration in the Middle East imposes a sense of collective responsibility on all five permanent members of the UN security council. It is one thing for Russia and China to exploit America&apos;s troubles from Gaza to Kabul; but it is another if the situation deteriorates to the point of general destabilisation in the region. Indeed, the Middle East&apos;s deepening problems may impose a sense of restraint in Russia and China by forcing them to calculate not in terms of their global &quot;nuisance value&quot; vis-a -vis the west, but in terms of their ability to make a positive, stabilising contribution to world order.

The 74-year-old faces a series of potential legal problems now that he no longer enjoys presidential immunity. He handed over the French presidency to Nicolas Sarkozy on May 16.

Judges have indicated they want to interview Mr Chirac over claims he ordered a secret intelligence investigation in 2004 to see if the allegations against Mr Sarkozy were true. The two men have had strained relations for several years.

In it he compiled a modern, critical edition of the hundreds of &quot;fragments&quot; - or quotations in other Chinese texts - that testified to the existence of the text of the Shen Tzu, a work of political philosophy completed c275BC that had been lost in direct transmission for more than a thousand years. Paul traced every single fragment of quoted text, determined its authenticity, collating it with other versions of the same piece of text, and finally established a critical edition of the surviving fragments that was authoritative. Even greater than this accomplishment was his creation of a method of scholarship that could be used to establish modern critical editions of all ancient Chinese works, whether still extant or not. The importance of this work has also been recognised in China: when the Shanghai museum recently announced the imminent publication of an unearthed fragment of the Shen Tzu, brush-written on strips of bamboo from the period in which the original work was compiled, they cited Paul&apos;s book as the definitive reference. Paul belonged to four different countries, but China, the land of his birth, was the enduring strand in his life. His parents were Irish missionaries with the China Inland Mission, and he was born at Shunde (Xingtai), in Hebei province, north-eastern China. At the time of the Japanese invasion in 1937, he was attending an English school at Chefoo (present-day Yantai, in Shandong province), and living with his mother, two brothers and sister, while his father was away on missionary work in the interior. At first, the Japanese allowed the school to continue, but after Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the internment of Japanese-Americans in the US, conditions became more severe. They were eventually moved to Weixian internment camp (in Shandong), where they remained until liberated by American paratroopers in 1945. Paul always said they had had enough to eat and, as a child living with his family, he did not feel any particular hardship. When the war ended, his family returned to Northern Ireland, and he completed secondary school in Belfast. His higher education was as unconventional as much of his life. After spells at the Free University of Amsterdam, the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis (where he met and married Marcia Cole in 1952), the US army language school at Monterey, California, a stint as an interpreter in Japan, and a few years teaching in Taiwan, he still had no BA. None the less, the great German sinologist, Hellmut Wilhelm, accepted him at the University of Washington at Seattle in 1959. Awarded a BA the following year, he went on to write his PhD, the earliest version of his Shen Tzu Fragments. After a period of teaching at the University of Wisconsin (1963-70), Paul joined Professors DC Lau and AC Graham at the School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) in London in 1970. Soas soon became the centre of classical Chinese learning in the western world; it was also an extraordinarily convivial place. Lau had a dry, ironic wit that some people found intimidating and Graham was oblivious of social norms, but Paul had a natural social grace that made the most awkward student or visitor feel comfortable. He also had an extraordinary breadth and depth of erudition; one subject of conversation thus led easily into another, and long hours were spent in the student bar and Chinese restaurants, discussing everything under the sun, but often returning to Chinese philosophy and how to understand particular lines of ancient texts. Paul was a true Chinese junzi, a term usually translated as &quot;gentleman&quot;; that is, he was graceful, kind, intellectually curious, good-hearted, a generous and loyal friend, and reluctant to conform to the petty demands of bureaucracy. To a younger colleague, he was a magnificent model, if not quite the mentor approved by institutions. His teaching was also blissfully free of convention. One of his former students, Vivienne Lo, has written: &quot;He had that quality that I imagine of the ideal, old-style English education: concerned for personal enrichment in the broadest sense, inspiring us to apply an intellectual vitality to whatever life would bring rather than training for vocation ... He was barely concerned with examinations, giving us broad hints about what would be on the paper, in favour of engaging us in lively conversation on whatever garden path the particular text we were reading would lead us up.&quot; Paul became interested in the potential of computers for producing editions of ancient Chinese texts early on. Before the problem of easily inputting Chinese characters using an alphabetic keyboard had been solved, he created a system that was, in some ways, more sophisticated than those now in use. These are based primarily on statistical tabulations of frequency, which aid the computer in generating a list of the most likely characters, from which the person typing must choose. Paul&apos;s system would also have incorporated sophisticated grammatical analysis. After his retirement in 1996, he continued living in London and worked on using the potential of computers to produce rigorous editions of excavated and other ancient Chinese texts in a visually transparent manner. He is survived by his wife, Marcia, daughter Aidan and sons Brian and Kevin. \u00b7 Paul Mulligan Thompson, sinologist, born February 10 1931; died June 12 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/thepriceofthestatusquo", "publicationDate": "2007-07-01T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["And the fall-out from that for Beijing is that the greater prize of Taiwan is even further from its grasp as the island&apos;s people rally behind its status as the only territory claimed by China in which real democracy operates."], "title": "Hong Kong's business as usual", "article": "Speak to the government in Hong Kong, the territory&apos;s business leaders or British officials and you will hear the same story - nothing has changed since the handover to China 10 years ago. Beijing, they will add, has respected the provisions of the Sino-British accords guaranteeing the preservation of the Hong Kong way of life for 50 years. So there is nothing to regret, nothing to worry about. If there are more mainlanders in the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People&apos;s Republic of China, that is a good thing because their spending has boosted retail consumption and the property market. In one sense, all this is perfectly correct. The people of the SAR enjoy a degree of liberty still not known on the mainland under the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formulation - though one should never forget that the first part counts for more than the second, in the leadership compound by the Forbidden City. The rule of law has been maintained. The civil service is clean and effective. People travel freely. No official censorship has been imposed. The currency is pegged to the US dollar, and the People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) keeps to itself. That was what the British regarded as the best they could get when they worked out the deal with Beijing. Under Deng Xiaoping, the People&apos;s Republic was set on regaining the lost territory at the mouth of the Pearl River. The PLA commander in neighbouring Guangdong appears to have nurtured plans to march across the border during the Cultural Revolution. But force was not necessary. Nor was Britain going to send the Royal Navy into Kowloon Bay. Even if it had done so, China could simply have cut off the water supply to Hong Kong Island. If the deal was a diplomatic way for Britain to hand over sovereignty and claim that it had got the best possible outcome for the people of Hong Kong, it also suited Beijing pretty well. Deng&apos;s economic reforms needed a benign international climate that would foster the export trade; a confrontation over Hong Kong would not have been in the broader interests of the PRC. And gaining such a rich and globally connected city could only be to its benefit; the cliches about geese and golden eggs that floated around 10 years ago were quite apposite, to the point that the head of Beijing&apos;s Hong Kong and Macau office now acknowledges that the PRC may have put rather too much emphasis on reassuring the tycoons. The outcome in 1997, and most of what has happened since, had been so carefully choreographed and was seen by both sides as being in their fundamental interests that, when the time came, it steamrollered Chris Patten&apos;s democratisation. The early-morning ceremony on July 1, 10 years ago, saw everybody from Jiang Zemin to Prince Charles solemnly signing up to a return to the status quo ante. Since then, Beijing has not had to depart from its agreements with London in order to impose itself; it had been given full licence to liquidate the Patten experiment by the outgoing power, which had previously consistently refused the territory electoral democracy. If you take the political situation at the time of the joint declaration in 1984, continuity has been achieved there, too, with a powerful executive answering to the sovereign power - then, appointed by London, now picked by a small circle of electors largely approved of by Beijing, But then, the realists would say, when have colonial powers been in the business of allowing democracy? True enough except for two particular factors that still resonate beneath the business-as-usual mantra in the SAR. If there were to be colonies, Hong Kong was just about the best in breed. That was due in part to the British administrators but, above all, to the Chinese inhabitants who had made the place work since at least the defeat of the British by the Japanese at the end of 1941. The Hong Kong Chinese became famous for their business success, but they also nurtured a strong middle class, with a lot of intelligent values that CP Scott would have relished. The Patten years briefly gave them a political voice, and that was not swept away after 1997, whatever the institutional reversion. The handover did not turn them into &quot;slaves of Beijing&quot;, but it left the obvious question. As a colleague at the South China Morning Post newspaper mused, why were Indonesians and Filipinos able to pick their rulers, while she and her fellow Hong Kongers could not? In the ongoing debate about whether China will ever evolve into a western-style democracy, it seems to be accepted that this cannot happen without the rule of law, official accountability and the emergence of a political class outside the one-party system. In 1997, Hong Kong had all three. It was the ideal setting in which to add the last storey to the edifice - a legislative assembly with real powers and a popularly elected chief executive. Instead, the deal that enabled the handover to take place so smoothly and enables all concerned to rejoice in &quot;business as usual&quot; prevents any such development because of Beijing&apos;s fear of the &quot;Hong Kong virus&quot; affecting the mainland. Myself, I do not see democracy coming to China any time soon, for a whole array of reasons. But the tragedy of Hong Kong is that this was where it could have happened. And the fall-out from that for Beijing is that the greater prize of Taiwan is even further from its grasp as the island&apos;s people rally behind its status as the only territory claimed by China in which real democracy operates. Instead of being able to build something new on the basis of what had already been achieved, the SAR was, therefore, crammed into a time warp in which big votes for pro-democracy parties did not translate into real political clout. There have been occasional breakouts, as in the protests at the draft anti-subversion legislation. An opposition candidate was able to run in the chief executive race, though the result was pre-ordained. But the prospect of a democratic election for the post recedes into the far future while the legislature&apos;s powers remain minimal. If nothing has changed, that is precisely the problem."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/02/china.jonathanwatts", "publicationDate": "2007-07-01T23:04:37Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The group said immigration officials turned back hundreds of followers who had tried to enter from Taiwan."], "title": "Protests and celebrations in Hong Kong", "article": "The president of China, Hu Jintao, said political reform in Hong Kong must progress in a &quot;gradual and orderly&quot; way as thousands of people took to the streets to demand more democratic accountability.

In a swearing-in speech at the start of his second term, Donald Tsang, the chief executive of Hong Kong, promised to release guidelines this year that would identify the best form of universal suffrage for the territory. He faces a difficult task of balancing the conservative instincts of the communist authorities in Beijing with the desire of the local population for change. Polls suggest the vast majority of Hong Kong people would like full democracy immediately. The chief executive is chosen by an 800-member commission hand-picked by Beijing, while voters elect only half of the 60 members of the legislative council, the territory&apos;s mini-parliament. The annual democracy rally attracted at least 6,000 people, who marched through the city centre chanting, &quot;One man, one vote&quot;, and carrying banners proclaiming, &quot;Democracy is not a gift from Beijing&quot;.

Here, at the Karlovy Vary Film festival, we were all jolted by news of the death of Edward Yang. &quot;I just can&apos;t picture a world without Edward in it,&quot; murmured one critic, who had known him for more than two decades. He was that kind of film-maker. Not only admired, but adored. Born in Taiwan, Yang lived for some years in Los Angeles, and died at his home in Beverly Hills. His life was always split between his homeland and the US; as a young man, he studied computer science at the University of Florida, and then worked in Seattle for a time, as a software developer. It was there, apparently, that he discovered a passion for cinema. For this, we should be grateful, since his importance to the medium can hardly be overestimated. Along with Hou Hsiao-hsien, his fellow director, friend and collaborator, Yang was regarded as a figurehead of New Taiwanese Cinema, one of the most significant stylistic movements of the past two decades. (Hou not only starred in Taipei Story (1985), Yang&apos;s breakthrough film, but actually mortgaged his own home so that the movie could be made.) And Yang&apos;s debut feature, 1983&apos;s That Day on the Beach, was arguably the film that kickstarted the whole movement, the A Bout de Souffle of its time. I met Yang only once, at a party at the Cannes film festival in 2005, where he was serving on the grand jury; I&apos;d heard he&apos;d been ill, but he looked robust and happy. He spoke of being in remission from cancer, and said he was hoping to make another film. He had for a number of years been developing an animation project, The Wind, in collaboration with Jackie Chan. Hardly an obvious partnership - Yang&apos;s films are as subdued, as reflective, as Chan&apos;s are kinetic - in some ways it was a good idea. Yang was, after all, a noted cartoonist as well as a film-maker - and also a keen student of music and theatre and the visual arts. He seemed, in many ways, a complete man, worldly and refined; cinema was merely one of his many interests. Nevertheless, he was one of the greatest film artists of our time: developing and refining a style (fixed camera, long takes, naturalistic dialogue) that has influenced scores of directors around the world. Yang screenings these days are rare events, and the fact that so many of his works remain unavailable on DVD is regrettable to say the least - although some are trying to release A Brighter Summer&apos;s Day and The Terroriser, two of his finest works. For the moment, his testament resides chiefly in Yi-Yi, his final film. It won him the Best Director prize at Cannes in 2000, and demonstrates in ample measure his particular gifts: his patient eye, his gentle humour, his wise and generous humanity.

It keeps you in touch with the world, rather than drifting off into Saga mentality. My wife, Lorraine, is in her mid-50s, I&apos;m 60. When the youngest of our three sons moved out 15 years ago, we were left in our five-bedroom house in Bristol. We thought about moving - I didn&apos;t see the point in forking out to heat empty rooms - then we saw an advert in the paper wanting rooms for foreign students. It&apos;s not great money, but it&apos;s enough to pay the mortgage, so we decided to stay put. The students here now are Martin from Switzerland and Raymond from Taiwan, but it varies from month to month. We&apos;re allowed only three at a time, and they all have to be of different nationalities so they are forced to speak in English. That&apos;s what we do in the evening - sit around the dinner table and chat. It&apos;s easy to watch TV and get depressed about the country, but when you meet people from all over the world, you find most of them are positive about what they&apos;re doing, where they&apos;re going. It relaxes your concepts of what life is about, and the way society is going. Lorraine&apos;s a very good cook and we often pick up recipes from the students. You&apos;ve got to have house rules. We have two washing machines they can use on Sundays only. They aren&apos;t allowed to use the kitchen to cook, unless it&apos;s a weekend and we&apos;re not there. We don&apos;t want people coming in late making noise. It can seem chaotic sometimes: Lorraine is a singing teacher, so she needs a room with a piano; I teach maths and run after-school classes. So you&apos;ve got students arriving with suitcases and there&apos;s a singing lesson going on in one room and I&apos;m teaching maths in another. We don&apos;t get too attached to the students -we&apos;ve got on particularly well with a few, and one boy even went on holiday with our friends. But mostly we don&apos;t keep in touch. Sometimes we&apos;ll refer to so-and-so&apos;s room, names that date back five or 10 years. Some people&apos;s characters are strong enough to linger. We do get time to ourselves; you&apos;re just never quite sure when it will be. We make the most of it when it comes along. But, having had three children from almost as soon as we were married, the house has never felt like our own. We have talked about whether we should keep doing it.

Mr de Villepin was forced to return early from holiday last week when his Paris home and office were raided by judges investigating whether he had schemed to damage his rival&apos;s reputation and wreck his presidential ambitions. Mr de Villepin issued a statement yesterday saying he had been summoned for further questioning at the end of this month by judges who were considering placing him under official investigation. The alleged smear campaign laid bare the poisonous feuding inside former president Jacques Chirac&apos;s government, with Mr Chirac and his protege Mr de Villepin at loggerheads with party rival Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Sarkozy triumphed, using the scandal to portray himself as a victim of high-level skulduggery. The so-called Clearstream affair dates back to the summer of 2004. An anonymous source wrote to a judge accusing a number of politicians and businessmen of holding secret bank accounts with a Luxembourg bank, Clearstream. The accounts were said to hold kickbacks from the $2.8bn (now \u00a31.4bn) sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991. On the list was the then finance minister Mr Sarkozy. Paris braced itself for the corruption scandal of the decade. But the judge established that the accounts did not exist. Mr Sarkozy said the affair had been used to discredit him and last year lodged an official complaint with magistrates, saying he had been the victim of a smear campaign. Judges are assessing whether senior members of the government prolonged the bogus corruption scandal, using intelligence officials in a deliberate plot to spread rumours about Mr Sarkozy and destroy his reputation. Mr de Villepin was a minister at the time the scandal broke, and says he was simply fulfilling his duties to check rumours of wrongdoing by a cabinet colleague. His statement yesterday said he acted &quot;strictly in accordance with his duties as foreign affairs minister and [then] interior minister and denies any criminal involvement in this case&quot;. Mr de Villepin was questioned by judges for 17 hours in December. The search of his flat and fresh summons for questioning come after new evidence was unearthed in the memory of a computer belonging to an intelligence chief.

Since 2005 annual military spending worldwide has topped $1 trillion ($1.204 trillion last year), climbing to the level reached at the worst of the East-West standoff and the heyday of arms control. The collapse of the Soviet Union triggered a deadly chain reaction, disseminating weapons of mass destruction and encouraging the affirmation of national or ethnic identity, often backed by violence. Over the same period the threat from non-state and international terror organisations has increased. Studies by research institutes - the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London and the Bonn International Centre for Conversion - underline this alarming trend. Last year the world as a whole allocated more than 2.5% of gross domestic product to military spending, equivalent to $184 per person (it was $135 in 2001). Spending has increased by 37% in 10 years, with military and paramilitary forces expanding from 26.8 million to 31 million. The US, whose military budget accounts for almost half the global total, must shoulder much of the blame for this trend, mainly because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Russia, China and India military spending is rising too. And the first two countries&apos; official defence budget represents only half the true figure. Predictably, rich countries are the biggest spenders. Out of the $1.1 trillion spent in 2005, Group of Eight nations accounted for $707bn. Talk of international solidarity rings hollow when development aid in 2005 amounted to $106.8bn worldwide. The UN spends $4bn to $5bn a year funding about 15 peacekeeping missions - the monthly cost of the US war on terrorism. Even the concept of disarmament seems to have become irrelevant. Despite the US-Russia chill, relations between the three great powers (including China) have improved. None of them considers it a priority to reduce the others&apos; stockpile, at least not if it involves sapping their own military potential. Each has an agenda. Russia is determined to gain full control over its territory and re-establish its sphere of influence, while containing Nato expansion eastward and modernising a partly obsolete arsenal. China wants to secure its energy supply routes, actively deploying military and diplomatic means to this end. It is also modernising its armed forces, clearly focusing on a possible conflict over Taiwan. For the US the priorities are the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the threat from rogue states and the war on terrorism. Washington is consequently paying less attention to the strategic situation in Europe. As a result, little has been done to capitalise on the &quot;positive&quot; outcome of the cold war. The US decision to disregard the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty and build an anti-missile shield is emblematic of this trend. Neither the US nor Russia seems keen to extend the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty, due to expire at the end of 2009. The outlook for the treaty on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe and its counterpart on the limitation of intermediate nuclear forces is increasingly gloomy. No progress has been made towards setting up comprehensive guidelines for monitoring biological arms programmes. And it is clear from efforts by North Korea and Iran to acquire nuclear warheads for their missiles that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty is under threat. Many countries realise that they need to take part in peacekeeping operations, providing an incentive to increase military spending. Disarmament is not a universal goal, even if the international community tends to impose it on defeated military regimes. The focus seems to be shifting to non-state organisations, over which treaties and regulations have no control. The US administration has used them to justify unilateral action, often involving pre-emptive intervention. But this approach has yet to prove its worth. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on, with no immediate prospect of peace. But the US is not alone. The international community is powerless to halt the conflict in Darfur and incapable of preventing the proliferation of cruise missiles, undoubtedly the greatest threat to peace in the near future. The arms trade is also truly international. All of this fuels increasing military spending and leaves little room for optimism."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/16/money1", "publicationDate": "2007-07-16T09:36:24Z", "tags": ["Business", "Money"], "sentences": ["The Dutch group, which is offloading significant stakes in semi-conductors to concentrate on high-margin businesses such as medical systems, said net profit rose fivefold to \u20ac1.6bn because of a \u20ac1.2bn gain from selling shares in Taiwan Semiconductor.", "But Taiwan&apos;s Hon Hail denied reports it would buy the stake."], "title": "Strong euro drags on Philips", "article": " Philips, Europe&apos;s largest consumer electronics company, today posted a leap in pre-tax earnings in the second quarter of more than a third, to \u20ac389m (\u00a3263m), but saw its shares fall on fears over the impact of the weak dollar on sales.

Each has his supporters, with many putting Yang, less well-known internationally, above his distinguished colleague. It is quite possible that had Yang not suffered from the colon cancer that curtailed his work and finally killed him, he would have increased his reputation. Yang&apos;s seven feature films, united by his particular visual style (deliberate pacing, long takes, fixed camera, few closeups, empty spaces, cityscapes) and subject matter (the impact of the changes of Taiwanese society on the middle classes) make up an impressive body of work. Born Te-Chang Yang in Shanghai, he moved to Taipei at the age of two with his family after the leaders of China&apos;s nationalist government were exiled to Taiwan. There he grew up watching films by the likes of Federico Fellini and Robert Bresson, dreaming of becoming a film-maker. Yet he studied electrical engineering at the University of Florida and worked in computer design in Seattle. But his experience in 1972 watching Werner Herzog&apos;s Aguirre, Wrath of God, &quot;turned me around&quot;, as he told Cineaste Magazine. &quot;It restored my sense of competence that I could become a film-maker. This is what I thought a film should be. Film school would never teach you to make those kinds of shots.&quot; He returned to Taiwan and wrote the screenplay for The Winter of 1905 (1981) and directed an episode in the four-part feature, In Our Time, (1982), the film that is considered the starting point of the Taiwanese new wave. Yang&apos;s segment, set in the 1960s, a simple tale of a young girl searching for love, heralded a new director of talent. Yang&apos;s first feature, That Day On the Beach (1983) awakened more interest in him. Told in flashbacks, moving on different narrative levels (a favourite device), it told of two women, former schoolfriends, reunited after a 13-year separation. Reminiscing was to be one of his prominent themes. Taipei Story (1984), Yang&apos;s collaboration with Hou Hsiao-hsien (they were born in the same year) as co-writer and leading player, has a couple discussing their pasts in an empty apartment, which gradually evolves into an Antonioniesque study of urban alienation. Yet, although he was considered the &quot;oriental Antonioni&quot;, Yang avoided the psychological identification with one particular character, taking a wider perspective in which the city and characters interact. The rather dreamlike The Terrorizors (1986) focuses on three couples, whose relationships are fluid. A Brighter Summer Day (1991) is an elliptical multi-character (there are 100 speaking parts) study of adolescents, set in Tapei in the early 1960s. Meticulously observed through mostly long and medium shots, it has sequences in semi-darkness that reveal the characters&apos; sense of estrangement but also reflects the fact that the Taiwanese suffered many power cuts during the period. Yang followed this dark film with two less well-received but effective satirical comedies, A Confucian Confusion (1995) and Mahjong (1996), before embarking on his most successful film, Yi Yi (A One and a Two, 2000), a cryptic and beautifully nuanced story of a middle-class family seen from different perspectives. At almost three hours long, it delicately shows characters integrating and interconnecting as a commentary on the pains and pleasures of relationships. Among the many awards the film garnered was the best director prize at Cannes. Sadly, it was to be his final film, though he planned to make The Wind, an animated feature with Jackie Chan budgeted at $25m, to be drawn by Yang, heading a team of animators. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2000, shortly after receiving the Cannes award but, when it spread to his liver and a lung, he moved to southern California to seek additional medical treatment. Yang, who had become an American citizen, died at his home in Beverly Hills, survived by his wife, the concert pianist Kaili Peng, and their son, Sean. \u00b7 Edward (Te-Chang) Yang, film director, born November 6 1947; died June 29 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/19/softeningup", "publicationDate": "2007-07-19T07:00:00Z", "tags": ["Gordon Brown", "US news", "Douglas Alexander", "Labour", "Gender"], "sentences": ["Ironically perhaps, it is Taiwan that has shown the greatest commitment to soft power - but is least likely to benefit from it with China.", "In her book on soft power, Vision for a New Era, Taiwanese vice-president Lu Hsiu-lien denigrates hard power for allowing only &quot;zero sum games&quot; - where every winner creates a loser.", "In contrast, &quot;the developmental and sharing nature of soft power is always a positive sum game.&quot; Naming the five key tools of soft power as human rights, democracy, peace, love and technology, Hsiu-lien credits soft power with the successful transition of Taiwan from former colony to fledgling democracy.", "In the years following the second world war Taiwan&apos;s New Feminism movement, in which she played an active part, emancipated women from traditional Confucian roles to help build a cooperative grass roots economy, which forms the basis of Taiwan&apos;s sustainability today.", "While gender has played little or no part in the exploration of soft power in the US and Europe to date, there are some signs that the move away from hard power, post Iraq, will emphasise a more feminine language that echoes the Taiwanese experiment."], "title": "Softening up", "article": "When Douglas Alexander spoke to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington last week he made a plea for more use of soft power in international diplomacy. While many will welcome the instant change of approach from a British foreign minister, just as many will be querulous: how, they will want to know, do you do soft power? The term was first coined by Harvard Professor Joseph Nye in 1990 who described soft power as:  &quot;The ability to get what you want by attracting and persuading others to adopt your goals. It differs from hard power, the ability to use the carrots and sticks of economic and military might to make others follow your will.&quot;  Soft power can take the form of diplomacy, conflict transformation and dialogue forums of all kinds. But it can equally be gathered and deployed through more abstract or cultural forms such as rock music, design technology (in the form of desirable consumer goods and services), and sport. Anything, in short, that makes the wielder of soft power attractive to others. Nike to McDonalds, West Wing to iPhones - these are all effective soft power tools. The corridors of exchange that are opened up are not only for commercial goods, but for the values of freedom, democracy, self-expression and prowess that come attached to them. It is not exclusively an American phenomenon. Japanese technology - in the form of must-have mobile phones and sleek computers - is hugely credited with the shift of attitude towards Japan in the west. A change from inscrutable eastern threat to oriental paragon of style and efficiency. But there has always been a hard edge to Nye&apos;s soft power, an underlying cynicism, which suggests it is simply another way to get your own way in the world without paying the full price. In a more recent speech on the war on terror for example, Nye says:  &quot;Both hard and soft power are important in the war on terrorism, but attraction is much cheaper than coercion, and an asset that needs to be nourished.&quot;  Since Nye however, others have taken up the general concept of &quot;soft power&quot; as a non-coercive means of change, and developed it in their own way. Both China and India have officially adopted soft power as a central plank of their foreign policy strategies - although neither has yet been put to the test with a crisis that might invite a violent response. Unlike South Africa, India has not moved to dismantle its nuclear bomb and, despite hosting global conferences on non-violence, is still prone to parading its military hardware for visiting dignitaries. China is well aware that its growing super power status could make it the world&apos;s most feared nation and appears to be relying on trade relations to give it a place in the international community. Its continuing poor report card on human rights, however, both at home and abroad, will leave its soft power stocks low and hence, make it unattractive as a political ally. Ironically perhaps, it is Taiwan that has shown the greatest commitment to soft power - but is least likely to benefit from it with China. In her book on soft power, Vision for a New Era, Taiwanese vice-president Lu Hsiu-lien denigrates hard power for allowing only &quot;zero sum games&quot; - where every winner creates a loser. In contrast, &quot;the developmental and sharing nature of soft power is always a positive sum game.&quot; Naming the five key tools of soft power as human rights, democracy, peace, love and technology, Hsiu-lien credits soft power with the successful transition of Taiwan from former colony to fledgling democracy. Hsiu-lien is also the first person to make specific links between feminism and soft power. In the years following the second world war Taiwan&apos;s New Feminism movement, in which she played an active part, emancipated women from traditional Confucian roles to help build a cooperative grass roots economy, which forms the basis of Taiwan&apos;s sustainability today. While gender has played little or no part in the exploration of soft power in the US and Europe to date, there are some signs that the move away from hard power, post Iraq, will emphasise a more feminine language that echoes the Taiwanese experiment. Not only words like cooperation and mediation, which refer to international politics, but engagement, inclusion, network building and wellbeing which are more often used to address local community development. The concept of soft, seen through these lenses, is not so much pliable as flexible; not giving in to aggression but able to transform it through imaginative and committed relationship building. Hard power continues to have a role, but as a defensive rather than an aggressive force. The enhanced skills that are required to make soft power truly effective in conflict zones could - as the UN and others repeatedly claim - be seen as the special province of women. On a local community level it is also women who are more inclined to engage at the margins of society, through professions like social work and teaching. But as we draw further away from the century of war and industry, in which masculinity had a more defined role, those distinctions may become increasingly blurred. Before he became PM, Gordon Brown was quoted in the Evening Standard saying: &quot;We need both hard power and soft power in order to answer the current challenges to our security,&quot; (April 17 2007) and who would question that other than die-hard pacifists? But the relationship between the two is crucial. Under the American model, hard power is the default and soft power the secondary approach. The military-industrial complex will enforce that balance for some time to come. But there is an argument to say that post war Europe has been more soft-power orientated. In his book Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century, Mark Leonard describes how Europe has created a strong community without using aggressive force: European politicians persistently engaging, taking on the laborious legislation and negotiation needed to knit these countries together on equal terms. Will Britain be able to continue honouring that process in the coming years, putting aside the instinct to appear special by siding up with America at any cost? As a positive alternative to turning against America, championing soft power - which is, after all, America&apos;s gift to the world - may be the way that Britain helps America to find a way forward."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/20/china.gambling", "publicationDate": "2007-07-20T09:32:39Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Gambling", "UK news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Every year, billions of dollars of investment are pouring in from overseas just as billions of Chinese yuan in gambling revenues flow in from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan."], "title": "Macau beats Vegas at its own game", "article": "Take 1,000 blackjack tables, hundreds of roulette wheels and a network of fake Venetian canals.

The result? The entertainment hub of Macau, which has overtaken Las Vegas in gaming revenues and now looks set to be the gambling capital of the world for decades to come. In a sign of newfound pulling power, Manchester United will visit for an exhibition game here next week. While the tabloids are likely to focus on the presence of enthusiastic gambler Wayne Rooney in one of the world&apos;s biggest casinos, the real significance of the match on Monday is that it marks a new stage in Macau&apos;s push into the international limelight. Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and their team-mates are the advance guard of an army of international sports and music stars making their way to this former Portugese colony (now, like Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China) just as Elvis Presley and Tom Jones made a beeline for Nevada in the 1970s. In October, the enclave will host a National Basketball Association extravaganza. In the following month comes tennis, with Pete Sampras playing Roger Federer. There are also plans for big-name concerts and circuses. They represent a shift in the international balance of capital and culture as China grows richer and more powerful, just as globalisation has an ever greater impact. Drawn by the proximity of China&apos;s 1.3 billion-strong population, America&apos;s tycoons are opening casinos and hotels here at the rate of almost one a month. The biggest will be the Venetian Macau with 3,000 hotel suites, 850 tables, 350 shops, a 15,000-seat entertainment arena, multi-purpose theatre and network of canals which will be Asia&apos;s biggest hotel and a contender for the most lucrative casino in the world. But this resort, which opens fully in August, is just the beginning for the new strip on the reclaimed land of Cotai. Christie Hefner recently announced plans to build China&apos;s first Playboy Mansion here. International designer brands are lining up to open shops nearby. &quot;Macau is a phenomenon. When people ask me &apos;what is China like?&apos;, I tell them go and look at Macau,&quot; said David Tang, a Hong Kong businessmen and designer who will open a boutique on the Cotai strip. &quot;It is a bit wild west, frantic about money, frantic about building and screw the rest. It is supremely capitalist.&quot; Macau is awash with cash and tourists. Every year, billions of dollars of investment are pouring in from overseas just as billions of Chinese yuan in gambling revenues flow in from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan. In the past decade, visitor numbers have more than tripled to pass the 20 million mark. This in a cosy island community of just 500,000 people. Such is the surge of construction that even mainland China looks laggardly by comparison. The skyline is never still as cranes, scaffolding and tens of thousands of labourers reshape this traditional and culturally rich territory. It is not always a pretty sight. To emphasise the wealth of the island, many new casino resorts are not just illuminated by neon but built with garish materials. The Sands is made of burnished gold; the MGM Macau, which opens in November, is a cigarette-lighter shaped complex layered in gold, silver and bronze, while towering above them both is the half-completed lotus of the Grand Lisboa. By day, it looks like a giant piece of cheap jewellery, but at night the illuminations are stunning. It is owned by Stanley Ho, the local patriarch who had the monopoly on gambling in Macau until 2002. Until then the territory had a reputation for Triad gangsters, money laundering and prostitution. But with the liberalisation of the market, international capital has transformed the gambling business. Mr Ho&apos;s Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM) group is now racing to catch up with new American competitors. &quot;Macau is going through a period of accelerated evolution,&quot; said Frank McFadden, president of new business development at SJM. But he says the target is not Las Vegas, which is also growing rapidly. &quot;We are really after the Chinese market. The savings ratio there is high and more than 40% is being moved into stock. They have a high level of disposable income.&quot; Mr McFadden knows the potential. He was formerly manager of Sands Macau, which recouped its initial investment less than a year after it opened in 2004. The Grand Lisboa is still only partly finished, but it claimed a million visitors in its first month after the casino floor opened in February. Across the road is the Wynn resort, which began business last September offering gambling, fine dining for 1,000 people and top-of-the-range bedroom suites for HK$35,000 (\u00a32,200) complete with butler service and massage room. &quot;We have seen fascinating changes,&quot; said Reddy Leong, PR manager for the resort. &quot;Ten years ago, nobody had heard of Macau so we used to have to tell them it was a place near Hong Kong. But now, everybody knows.&quot; Macau is trying to move upmarket. With the development of the Cotai strip, it wants to attract more conference and exhibition business, extending the average visitor&apos;s stay from a fervid 1.2 days to a more relaxed 3.5 days. There are concerns, however, that the growth of the gambling industry could destroy the local community and its mix of Chinese and Portuguese traditions. There is more money than ever before, but also more traffic, a higher divorce rate and the closure of small businesses that cannot afford a tripling of rent prices. University students are being lured away from their courses by the prospect of $2,000 per month dealer salaries - far more than they could earn in most other more skilled jobs. &quot;A lot of wealth has been gained by a lot of people. But we don&apos;t know what the long-term impact of that will be on the community,&quot; said Glenn McCartney, a lecturer, pub owner and honorary British consul. Since he came to Macau in 1997, Mr McCartney says annual visitor numbers have increased from 7 million to 22 million. They are expected to hit 36 million by 2010. Almost all come to gamble, but he says it is important for tourists and investors to remember that they are visiting and building on something more substantial than the sands of Nevada. &quot;I don&apos;t like to say that Macau is the Las Vegas of Asia because it is different. Las Vegas came out of the desert, but this is a place with history, where people have lived for generations,&quot; he said. The expansion still has a long way to go. Next year, hundreds more tables, slots machines and hotel rooms will come on line. Local businessmen expect economic growth to sizzle along at 20% a year at least until 2012. And to keep the high-rollers rolling in, the authorities are planning a $3.8bn bridge that would link Macau with Hong Kong and the mainland city of Zhuhai. There is concern that capacity may exceed demand. But as long as the Communist government in Beijing supports this cash cow by banning gambling on the mainland while keeping the borders open to Macau, prospects are likely to remain rosy. The urge to bet among Chinese punters shows no sign of flagging. The big names Macau$7.2bn gross gaming revenues in 2006 at 22 casinos. History Former Portuguese colony with a long tradition as a bastion of Catholicism, handed over to China in 1999. The gaming industry has been the mainstay of the economy for decades. Until 2002, it was monopolised by the local tycoon Stanley Ho. For much of that time, Macau had a reputation for Triad gangs, money laundering and prostitution. But in recent years, the market has been liberalised and many US-owned casinos have opened on the main island and along the new Cotai strip, aimed at the exhibition, conference and entertainment market. Las Vegas$6.6bn gross gaming revenues in 2006 at the strip&apos;s 40-odd casinos. History The casino strip was largely built from the sands of Nevada after gambling was legalised in the US in 1931. Famed for decades as a centre of organised crime and prostitution. Experienced a building boom in the 1990s as resorts such as the Wynn arrived with a promise of more family-oriented leisure experience and the attraction of big names such as Celine Dion."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/22/theobserver.observerbusiness6", "publicationDate": "2007-07-21T23:04:25Z", "tags": ["Business"], "sentences": ["The CV Name Ho Kwon Ping Age 54 Educated Tunghai University, Taiwan, Stanford University, California; University of Singapore Career Journalist on Far Eastern Economic Review until 1981; joined family business the Wah Chang Group (construction, clothing, consumer goods) until 1996; founded Banyan Tree hotels group, now executive chairman of Banyan Tree Holdings Family Married to Claire Chiang and has two sons and a daughter"], "title": "Mammon: Ho Kwon Ping, Banyan Tree Holdings chairman", "article": "On Boxing Day 2004 Ho Kwon Ping, founder and executive chairman of the Banyan Tree chain of luxury hotels and resorts, was in Mexico when he received a phone call from the other side of the world. It was his general manager in Phuket. &apos;He said: &quot;There is this huge wave coming!&quot; Then there was silence,&apos; Ho recalls. Ho turned on the BBC but found that news of the Asian tsunami was yet to break. Then the phone rang again. It was his GM in Sri Lanka. He told the same story - a huge wave, heading his way, about to hit. It was not looking good for Ho, whose properties were dotted across the Indian Ocean. The next call came from the Maldives; more followed. By the time the tsunami had passed, nine of Banyan Tree&apos;s 20 or so resorts had been struck. Although Ho was insured, the wave had longer-term consequences for his company: the year following the tsunami &apos;we suffered because nobody came&apos;, he says. In that year occupancy rates dropped from a typical 70 per cent to 20 per cent and Banyan Tree made a loss. Ho points out that since its foundation in 1996, Banyan Tree has made a profit every year except 2005. Last year, Banyan Tree Holdings - which owns the 21 resorts, 58 spas and 68 &apos;retail galleries&apos; - was floated in Singapore. It was sold at Singapore for S$0.97 a share. The shares are now worth S$2.83; the market capitalisation is S$2.2bn (about \u00a3730m). That is the free float - Ho owns the remaining 50 per cent of the business. As you would expect given this background, Ho looks at home in the Savoy, where he holds court on his frequent visits from his Singapore base to London (though he stays in a flat nearby). He cuts a suave figure in suit and open-necked shirt, talking on a range of subjects from the pros and cons of colonialism and the legacy of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore to the impact that the travel industry is making on the environment. Ho lapses into marketing-speak when he describes what has made Banyan Tree successful. &apos;If I can get you to go with your partner to a Banyan Tree you have created memories of your own there. It is an emotional response you will remember forever.&apos; It is hard to listen to, but he probably has a point. He means that Banyan Tree resorts do not aim to offer plain luxury. Ho says, for example, that there is no point in giving solid silver cutlery where plate will do. People go for the locations, and the feeling of being away from everything. Ho, who started out in a Chinese trading family in Singapore, has become one of south east Asia&apos;s most prominent entrepreneurs. He studied at Stanford University but was suspended for joining a protest against the Vietnam War in 1972, when he was 20, and did not graduate. He continued his studies at the University of Singapore and now notes, sardonically, that Stanford has him as an alumnus &apos;for fundraising purposes&apos;. He moved on to work as a journalist on the Far Eastern Economic Review until 1981, when he joined to the family business, which he describes as a &apos;typical mini overseas Chinese conglomerate&apos;. Ho&apos;s family was part of the diaspora that has built up in south east Asia through emigration over the past two centuries. He is straightforward about the reputation the Chinese have in places like Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. &apos;The Chinese were ethnically quite distinct from the rest of the population. They were called the Jews of south east Asia. Over a long period of time they became very wealthy.&apos; However, despite decades of apparent success, Ho believed that by the 1980s the typical overseas Chinese business model was outdated. His diagnosis of why the &apos;mini overseas Chinese conglomerate&apos; was failing fixed in his own mind that he was going to leave the family firm, and determined the kind of business he would set up when he did. He says: &apos;The overseas Chinese business model - as most of them were engineered in the Seventies - was in trying to be the lowest-cost producer in terms of contract manufacturing for Western companies. In our family business, we did TVs for Mitsui, shoes for Nike, engineering, construction. We had businesses in Singapore, we had a business in Thailand and so on. The essential weakness of that model is that cost competitiveness is only a comparative advantage. When cheaper countries come in you are running to keep up.&apos; In the early Nineties, Ho had the jolt that made him change course. &apos;I had a real wake-up call. There was a business I started that was a sneaker contract manufacturer. It started in Thailand and in 12 months I closed it down. Indonesia was making sneakers more cheaply.&apos; The question then was what to do next. Ho says: &apos;I thought about it and realised there were two kinds of [business] advantage. There is competitive advantage, but that is comparative, and there is proprietary advantage. There are two kinds of this: technology - I am not technological - or there is a brand. &apos;I made the decision to build a proprietary brand and I was casting around looking for a candidate.&apos; Banyan Tree, in other words, started as a brand in search of a business. So why hotels? The choice was a &apos;fluke&apos;, says Ho. It transpires that in the Eighties, Ho and his brother had invested in land in Phuket, which they subsequently found to be partly contaminated as it was the site of an old tin mine. Nevertheless, he and his brother built several hotels there managed by other groups - Sheraton and Dusit, the Thai group, for example. Ho believed that there was space at the very top of the market for places that gave the &apos;emotional&apos; response he likes to describe. So he started Banyan Tree in 1996. More than a decade on, Ho believes that the business is secure because the brand is strong, not just in Asia but across the world. He says a third of customers come from north Asia - Japan, Korea and China - a third from Europe and the US and a third from the rest of the world. The next big geographical push will be to expand its presence in China. Ho says: &apos;We are in the process of starting our own private equity fund. We are raising $500-700m from institutional investors that we would use to add to our existing hotels in China. The fund will be used to develop properties in China, exiting in five to eight years&apos; time. [Eventually] the properties would have full management agreements with Banyan Tree.&apos; His ambition is to keep the business growing. He believes that there are few successful Asian-grown brands beyond examples such as Samsung, Hyundai and Lenovo, the Chinese company that has moved from building cheap computers to focus on its brand. At the moment, he is still fighting with his insurers to get his hands on $38m dating back to the tsunami. Ho says he has had close encounters of another kind too: from private equity funds wanting to buy into the business. He has refused. Why? He pumps out what sounds like a rehearsed line: &apos;Because I don&apos;t play golf.&apos; Ho believes that the global economy is at a point of flux. &apos;America has the sensibility of the colonial power, but how will the balance change? Is it Iraq that will have triggered it? I am very interested to see what the US will be in 100 years&apos; time.&apos; Perhaps his next goal will be finding out if there is a way to live that long.

It stands to reason that if you&apos;ve been told to leave the country you&apos;re not going to draw attention to yourself. But the irony is that once I know where to look, I find women like Salima - female failed asylum seekers - in all kinds of places. I meet them in local libraries, friends of friends&apos; kitchens, drop-in centres. On streets in the dusty parts of London that the tourist guides never mention - Canning Town, Hounslow, Tottenham, West Ham. For a few hours they appear in the foreground. Then, like ghosts, they melt away again. Salima Sekindi has packed a lot into her 37 years, but not in a good way. We sit in the drab living room of the house where she&apos;s currently camping out - at any time she could be asked to pick up her few belongings and leave. Like many asylum stories her account is by turns horrific and mundane, dramatic and repetitive. Life-changing events seem to happen in seconds, stultifying months of limbo follow. Salima tells me how in Uganda she was raped and tortured in front of her children when her husband, a Muslim, was arrested for suspected involvement in rebel groups. (He has never been seen or heard of again.) In Britain she is homeless, just about existing, sleeping on friends&apos; settees and floors. Her hair is falling out, a combination of stress and poor diet. Without any financial benefits, or the possibility of legal employment, there have been occasions when she&apos;s been forced to exchange sex for food. A man who offered her a room took advantage of her situation and she was raped again. &apos;I had no choice,&apos; she says. It was a business friend of her husband&apos;s who paid an agent to bring her to Britain. Salima travelled on a false passport and claimed asylum as soon as she arrived, six years ago, but her case was rejected. She has struggled, she says, to find effective legal advice. In 2005 she was arrested and taken to Yarl&apos;s Wood detention centre in Bedfordshire, where she went on hunger strike and attempted suicide by hanging, tying one of her sheets to the steel stairways. Three times she was taken to the airport to leave, three times the decision was changed on appeal at the last minute. Salima&apos;s voice grows hoarse and she finds it hard to stop the tears. She wipes her eyes on her denim jacket, determined to tell her story to the end. It isn&apos;t running away that seems to have broken her spirit. Or living under the constant fear of arrest. Or having to survive on the occasional handouts from friends. It is the gradual seeping away of any hope. &apos;I can&apos;t believe this is me,&apos; she says. &apos;I never imagined my life would come to this. Always waiting, not knowing what is going to happen.&apos; Believe the metaphors favoured by the media and you might think that Britain is drowning beneath a flood, a torrent, a deluge, a tidal wave of asylum seekers. One of the problems, say campaigners, is vocabulary. Most of us do not differentiate between economic migrants, arrivals from the newly expanded EU and asylum seekers. In fact, according to the most recent figures (from 2005) the number of people applying for asylum has dropped by 24 per cent. Most, according to The Destitution Trap, a recent report by Refugee Action, &apos;arrive here through chance, not choice, and most do not understand what seeking asylum means&apos;. Many of the women I speak to were brought over by &apos;agents&apos; who were paid substantial amounts of money. Hours after their client&apos;s arrival the agents invariably invent some sort of pretext - collecting tickets, buying coffee - and then disappear, never to be seen again. The vast majority of those asylum seekers who apply to stay here are rejected. Each year around two-thirds of applications made to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate at the Home Office are ultimately refused. Once the applicant&apos;s claim has been turned down and there is no outstanding appeal they are expected to leave the country within 21 days. Financial support and any accommodation provided by the National Asylum Support Service are cut off for single adults and childless couples. Ivy, who is 41, laughs a lot, although for the life of me I don&apos;t know why. She seems to survive on a droll sense of humour and a bird-like energy which finds her volunteering most days at different women&apos;s groups around Manchester. &apos;I make sure I keep myself busy,&apos; she says. &apos;You can&apos;t cry all the time.&apos; Every night she sleeps on a single bed which she shares with her 20-year-old daughter in a friend&apos;s living room. Her &apos;landlady&apos; doesn&apos;t know that Ivy is HIV positive, so she hides her medication under the mattress. Ivy was a dressmaker - &apos;a good one&apos; she says proudly - in Malawi. Five years ago she fled the country following threats of a forced marriage to her brother-in-law after the sudden death of her husband. Her application to stay was finally turned down in 2005. She and her daughter survive on a weekly handout from the Red Cross: a kilo of rice, a kilo of semolina, two apples, two potatoes and one bag of sugar. I ask her what is the most difficult aspect of her life now. &apos;I know where I am from, but I don&apos;t know where I am going,&apos; she says. &apos;My life is in somebody else&apos;s hands. Sometimes I overhear people criticising asylum seekers and I feel sorry for myself. They don&apos;t know what they are talking about. If I was allowed to work I could contribute. But we&apos;re forced to become beggars. We have no names.&apos; In the current popular debate there can be few labels as stigmatic as &apos;asylum seeker&apos;. Add the word &apos;rejected&apos; and &apos;female&apos; and you&apos;re pretty much at the bottom of the heap. Last year the journalist Natasha Walter became so alarmed by the stories she was hearing about women asylum seekers - pregnant women sent into detention centres, women forced to sleep rough - that she has helped to set up a campaign group, Women for Refugee Women, which aims to publicise the issues and lobby government. &apos;You get the feeling that women are sitting ducks,&apos; she says. &apos;While men might go into hiding women are more exposed. There is the fear that the authorities can sweep down on women and children in their homes.&apos;  About a third of all asylum seekers are female, yet campaigners argue that the 1951UN Convention on Refugees does not take into account women&apos;s experiences. It states that &apos;a person may be recognised as a refugee owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.&apos; Crucially it misses out the word gender.  Deborah Singer, co-ordinator of the Refugee Women&apos;s Resource Project at Asylum Aid, explains why this is significant: &apos;The convention was written over 50 years ago, during the Cold War, when the classic image of a refugee was a white man crossing over to the west from behind the Iron Curtain. The idea that a refugee might be a black woman from Africa was unheard of.&apos; Thus widely recognised forms of oppression such as rape, or forced marriage, or female genital mutilation are not strictly recognised by the guidelines. Meanwhile, the fact that a woman in their initial interview might say she&apos;s been persecuted because she&apos;s the wife or sister of an activist, or because she was involved in low-level political activity such as hiding someone or cooking for political meetings, is sometimes not taken seriously.  The concern is that women don&apos;t receive a fair hearing. This, says Singer, is despite the fact that evidence suggests that for a woman to make the decision to flee her country, going against social mores and often forced to leave her children behind, the situation she is running from is usually extremely treacherous - possibly worse than that of the men who arrive here.  However, campaigners claim that what women face when they come here, both in the media and inside the immigration centres in Croydon and Liverpool, is a culture of disbelief and the problem of how to prove crimes which have happened behind closed doors, many thousands of miles away. &apos;The sorts of persecution women are fleeing from are the kind a British woman would be protected from,&apos; says Singer. &apos;The criminal justice system has come a long way in treating victims of rape and domestic violence. But if you&apos;re a female asylum seeker looking for the same kind of understanding, you won&apos;t find it.&apos; Many of the women are too scared or shy or traumatised to disclose crimes such as rape. &apos;This is a recognised common pattern among British rape victims,&apos; says Singer, &apos;but these women are expected to talk to an official as soon as they arrive.&apos;  Robinah seems much older than 29. Her life is a catalogue of loss - first her mother and father, then her brother, most recently her sister-in-law. She describes growing up in Masaka, central Uganda, where she was looked after by her brother following the death of their parents. Her brother, who owned a bar, was a member of the banned Democratic Party. &apos;One day many soldiers came and attacked the bar and the shop where I worked nearby,&apos; she says. People were shot at and beaten. Robinah and her sister-in-law were raped. Her brother was taken away. &apos;I never found out what happened to him.&apos;  That night, Robinah and her sister-in-law slept in the bush. Months later, after living in hiding in Tanzania, they made their way to Britain with the help of an agent paid by their aunt. Early in the morning of their arrival he took them to a Ugandan-run bar - &apos;somewhere in east London, I didn&apos;t know where we were&apos; - and left them there. I wonder what kind of belongings she had. &apos;Jean jacket and lady&apos;s shoes,&apos; she replies. &apos;The kind of shoes you wear to church.&apos;  In immigration interviews, she was allotted a male case worker. She remembers being frightened. &apos;We thought they were going to take us straight back. My mind was panicking. I was very scared.&apos; She never mentioned the rape. &apos;I felt so ashamed. &apos; This was in 2001. Six years later Robinah&apos;s sister-in-law has vanished from the church where she was sleeping out and Robinah has been in detention five times. She survives with the help of handouts from a British woman who has taken her under her wing. Her application to stay in Britain has been turned down.  &apos;Imagine putting yourself in their shoes,&apos; says the actress Juliet Stevenson, who has campaigned on behalf of women asylum seekers and took part in a reading of &apos;Asylum Monologues&apos; along with fellow actor Kwame Kwei-Armah during Refugee Week in June. &apos;Imagine living in a country where you are persecuted, where you have seen your family killed, or left your children behind, or have been raped. Imagine getting on a plane and getting off in Taiwan and being asked to fill in a 19-page form you don&apos;t understand, in a language you don&apos;t know. What if that was you? There seems to be a concrete wall between how we want to be treated and how we think people from abroad should be.&apos;  The figures for women like Salima, Ivy and Robinah vary wildly. According to Home Office statistics there is a maximum of 283,500 refused asylum seekers in Britain. Unofficial estimates from Amnesty International suggest the figure could be almost double. Many don&apos;t return for fear of their lives back home, some are unable to safely obtain travel documents or valid visas. The New Asylum Model, introduced in April, aims to speed up the process of 90 per cent of applications to six months by 2011. However, there is a substantial backlog of cases and at the current rate of removal (according to Liam Byrne, Minister of Immigration, Nationality and Citizenship, someone leaves every 26 minutes) it will take at least 14 years to catch up, at a cost of \u00a311,000 per person.  Prior to 2002, asylum seekers were usually barred from working for the first six months while their asylum application was being considered, but after that they could apply for the restriction to be lifted. This is no longer the case. Campaigners suspect that because the government cannot afford to remove all refused asylum seekers it is resorting to making them destitute to get rid of them.  In theory, some refused asylum seekers can obtain &apos;Section 4&apos; shelter and \u00a335 worth of weekly food vouchers - provided they sign up to returning to their countries of origin. In practice, many are not eligible and others choose not to apply for it, seeing it as a ploy to force them to return. Either way, say asylum seekers and charity workers, the support is meagre and hard to access.  Destitution means sleeping in telephone boxes, church porticos, on friends&apos; floors or on the back seat of the night bus, going hungry or relying on a weekly bag of provisions handed out by charities. Rejected asylum seekers have access to emergency healthcare only, despite the fact that many have illnesses as the result of torture. I hear of women who have been handed a bill after giving birth. A bill they have no hope of paying.  The Red Cross drop-in centre is tucked away behind the smart shop-fronts on Islington High Street, in north London. Over the past 12 months the number of asylum seekers pitching up at these cramped offices has doubled. If they&apos;re lucky they can get supermarket vouchers, a free sleeping bag, a couple of hours&apos; advice . There&apos;s a room of basic clothing - vests, knickers, sweatshirts. Until recently there was a stash of Union Jack-patterned boxer shorts, but they&apos;ve all been given away. The image of rejected asylum seekers reduced to wearing patriotic underwear provides a rare moment of dark humour.  Marie-Anne Fishwick, who co-ordinates the centre&apos;s women&apos;s project, lists the people she has seen so far today. A woman in her forties with mental health problems due more to her current life than her old one in the Congo; an Ethiopian woman who is five months pregnant and has been split up from her husband; another Congolese woman, this one 19, who spends her nights on the streets in a sleeping bag; a woman from Kenya worried about the health of her poorly child. Fishwick&apos;s team is particularly concerned that women on the streets are vulnerable to exploitation. They know of at least 50 last year who became pregnant as a result of abusive relationships. &apos;It&apos;s not easy hearing women&apos;s stories, hearing that they would rather die and not being able to offer any comfort. It used to be that there were quite nice bits of my job,&apos; says Fishwick. &apos;People who had been granted leave to stay would come here and we&apos;d tell them what a pound coin was, or how to go on a list for housing. Now the majority are destitute and they understand that these hopeless circumstances are now their future.&apos;  In 2006 Jan Shaw, Amnesty International&apos;s refugee programme director, decided to focus her annual report on destitution. She knew it was a huge, underground problem, but she didn&apos;t realise quite how overwhelming the response would be when word got out. &apos;People literally walked across London to talk to us,&apos; she says. &apos;They were desolate. Their eyes lit up when they arrived here thinking we could do something, until they realised, in the short term at least, there was nothing we could do.&apos; She argues that despite improvements in the immigration service, asylum seekers are still at risk of not receiving a fair hearing. &apos;Poor decision-making, poor interpreting, poor legal advice is leading to destitution,&apos; she says. &apos;The only legal way out of this black hole is to say you will go home, but no one will do that.&apos; When Home Office staff come to the offices for meetings she makes sure they all drink their tea from mugs which read: &apos;I&apos;m standing up for refugees.&apos; The problem is that she is not at all convinced they are. There is an assumption among the authorities, she says, that asylum seekers understand their way around the legal system. In her experience the vast majority do not, and with recent changes to legal aid there are fewer solicitors available, or willing, to take on their complicated and time-consuming cases.  Louisa, 45, who was kidnapped in Zimbabwe for handing out pamphlets on behalf of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, has never found any decent legal advice. I realise how desperate she is when she asks me if I can recommend anyone. Four years ago a Zimbabwean lawyer she contacted ran off with both her passport and \u00a3600, and she&apos;s not found any other legal help since.  In the unlikely event that Louisa needs a reminder that she&apos;s under constant threat of being sent back to Zimbabwe she need only look up at the sky. She lives with her twin sister Elizabeth, who has legal status to remain in Britain, directly beneath the flight path to Heathrow . Every five minutes the grey underbelly of a plane hovers overhead. Every month she must sign on to prove that she is still in the country. Every month she has no idea if she will be ordered to leave.  The three of us talk in the living room where Louisa sleeps each night on the settee. She is especially anxious today. She needs to take her prescription for warfarin (the drug that reduces the risk of blood clots) to the chemist, but there is no money to pay for it. Louisa: &apos;When I came here I thought I would be safe, but you don&apos;t feel safe because you don&apos;t know what is going to happen to you. You don&apos;t know if someone will pick you up and lock you in.&apos;  Elizabeth: &apos;She has no money at all. I have to pay for everything. Food, clothes. And then my husband plays up. He is tired of it. He wants his home back.&apos;  Louisa: &apos;My sister is putting her marriage at risk letting me stay here. But even if I wanted to go home I would be killed. Either way you can&apos;t win. You are not allowed to be here. You are not allowed to be there. You are nowhere.&apos;  This is a crucial time for asylum issues: a new prime minister, a revamped Home Office, a surprise choice for home secretary and the UK Borders Bill currently making slow progress through parliament. &apos;We are pushing for amendments to the UK Borders Bill that will end the scandal of destitution at a stroke,&apos; says Donna Covey, chief executive of the Refugee Council and a member of the Still Human Still Here campaign. &apos;We think that it is morally unacceptable to use destitution to encourage refused asylum seekers to return to their country of origin, and so do a growing number of churches, charities and community organisations across the country who are picking up the pieces when people have nowhere else to go and nothing to eat.&apos; Church of England bishops have said that they&apos;re committed to debating the issue in the House of Lords. In Manchester I meet an unusual group of women seeking asylum. They have banded together to help one another with anti-deportation campaigns and publicise what it&apos;s like to be a female asylum seeker in Britain in 2007. Every Friday afternoon Women Asylum Seekers Together (WAST) meets in a small community centre. When I arrive there are four women in total, sitting incongruously on children&apos;s chairs in a huddle. As the afternoon goes on more appear, in pairs, in threesomes, some women pushing prams. In the end the room is packed with women from many of the world&apos;s most notorious countries : Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Nigeria.  Farhat Khan, a dignified, softly spoken woman from Pakistan, chairs the meeting. She has lived in Britain with her five children for seven years, after fleeing a violent marriage. Her husband&apos;s relatives have let it be known that her life would be in danger if she returned home. She introduces the group and later the women literally queue up to tell me their stories. Some are still stuck in the asylum process, waiting on decisions. Others have already been turned down and are living on handouts. All are living under the constant threat of detention.  First up is Naima Alam Maznura, whose husband, an activist in the Freedom Party in Bangladesh, has already been deported. She thinks he may have gone to India but she has no way of getting hold of him. Next I meet 24-year-old Florence Moses from Sierra Leone, a lesbian who was forced to marry her cousin. When she arrived in Britain she discovered she was carrying his child. Emiola Fadeyi, from Nigeria, is in a wheelchair and must live on \u00a330 a week. Then there is Asli, an Eritrean, born in Ethiopia. She is a bright and vivacious young woman whose twenties are slipping by while she waits for an answer from the Home Office. Farida Yesnin from Bangladesh becomes so distraught she gives up speaking and just puts her head in her hands. Her three-and-a-half-year-old son watches, bewildered.  It&apos;s impossible to talk to these women without thinking about questions of identity, about what it means to be British, and what it means to be stripped of everything - money, home, clothing, food, dignity - until you&apos;re rendered almost invisible. Elizabeth, who was accused of supplying pharmaceuticals to the rebels in Uganda, sums it up: &apos;It&apos;s like you are dead already. Nobody knows that you exist. No one even sees you.&apos;  Towards the end of the afternoon Farhat receives an unexpected telephone call. She replaces the receiver, visibly shaken . It was her solicitor, she tells me, her voice quivering. She has been given permission to remain in Britain. She can hardly believe it. For at least one of the women today there is something to celebrate. Finally, she has her life back. For the others, the agonising wait goes on.

What could it contribute to society? How do citizen journalists go about their work? What stories do they break? Those questions are answered in a short feature in the Taipei Times that highlights the growth of citizen journalism in Taiwan. It tells how Wu Ping-hai, who has neither a journalism degree nor experience working for newspapers or TV news programmes, has videoed &quot;a wide range of events, documenting the personal stories of ordinary people and the issues that concern local communities.&quot; He posts short documentaries on People Post, an online citizen news platform launched by the Taiwan Broadcasting System. Wu is one of more than 700 people who have contributed to community news coverage since the creation of the platform in April, together generating more than 2,200 news stories. They cover all manner of events in local communities, such as changes being made in a flood-prone area or the pollution of farmland. Two of Wu&apos;s films concern farmland tree frogs and the experiences of foreign spouses learning Mandarin. Like Wu, most of the contributors do not have any formal training in journalism. Some said they did not know how to edit a film before deciding to take up citizen journalism. But a lack of filming experience has not prevented contributors from producing some excellent reports. Nor do other superficial aspects of media presentation appear to matter. A citizen journalist known only as Claudia said: &quot;I could never become a TV anchor with my looks and my bad pronunciation of Mandarin and Taiwanese.&quot; Perhaps the most revealing comment - made at a citizen journalism seminar - came from a contributor nicknamed A-mao, who had posted film from a scouts club trip.

One moment it was there, in a blaze of sunshine, a venue for talks, films, drinks; the next it was gone, a structural dream that vanished as the seasons changed. The pavilion, though transient, was a wonderful, lightweight, light-filled structure. Although fun to look at, this structure was rooted in complex geometry, all the while wearing its learning with a delicate, almost fairy-tale ease. The pavilion had no facade and no hidden structural frame behind it; what you saw was 100% pure structure, its holistic beauty like that of a crystal or a snowflake. Over the past decade, Balmond - designer, musician, university teacher and author as well as engineer - has been working with some of the world&apos;s most daring architects to create radical new buildings. Perhaps one should say &quot;pushing&quot; them, rather than &quot;working with&quot; them. Toyo Ito, Rem Koolhaas and Daniel Libeskind are just three of the celebrated architects who are indebted to Balmond. It is significant that the delightful Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, in Denmark, has chosen to showcase Balmond&apos;s work to launch Frontiers of Architecture, its major series investigating and celebrating the factors that have influenced architecture over the past few years. Balmond is one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture, and has grown more radical with age. Born in Sri Lanka, he was educated in Colombo, before coming to the UK in 1962 to study engineering. In 1968 he joined Arup, the international engineering company, then busy with the completion of the Sydney Opera House. As well as masterminding such show-stealing structures as the 2008 Olympic Stadium in Beijing, with the Swiss architects Herzog + de Meuron, Arup designs homes for people whose lives have been turned inside out by natural disasters. Beneath the Arup umbrella, Balmond, now its deputy chairman, also runs his own research and design studio, AGU (Advanced Geometry Unit). Here he has been able to develop ideas based on fresh studies of geometry, on chaos theory (&quot;Chaos,&quot; he says, &quot;is a mix of several states of order&quot;), and on natural forms and structure. Balmond&apos;s push for a new architectural order is the result of a 25-year quest to get beyond the structures we have been familiar with since the ancient Greeks established the rules of geometry and proportion that we have followed ever since. Balmond has revolutionised the relationship between structural engineer and architect, acting like a spur, pushing them into unknown territory. As Rem Koolhaas says, &quot;Cecil has changed my outlook on structure and enabled me to rethink architecture.&quot; The Louisiana exhibition falls into three parts: Rainbow, Flux and Network. The first is a kaleidoscope of ideas concerning the development of geometry and maths over the millennia and showing how these have underpinned engineering and architecture. It&apos;s like an inventor&apos;s workshop, full of 3D models of geometric forms that are fun to look at even if you don&apos;t quite know what they mean. These are the tools of Balmond&apos;s trade. This leads to Flux, where visitors are surrounded by walls of film showing Balmond&apos;s favourite geometrical device: fractals, the structural basis of the 2002 Serpentine Summer Pavilion. These beautiful, hypnotic patterns might look like the result of some trippy, psychedelic experience, but what you see here is truly the DNA of a new architectural order. The term &quot;fractal&quot; was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot, the Franco-American mathematician, in 1975. It refers to the kind of complex structures found in snowflakes, any part of which can be multiplied through an infinite sequence to create a wider structure that never seems to repeat itself. In practice, this means it is possible to design a building with a structural system based on one particular shape that can be played with ad infinitum. The Ito-Balmond Serpentine pavilion was a delightful example. The third room, Network, tries to show how these complex ideas combine to produce buildings and other structures. Network is also a reminder of the extraordinary diversity of projects Balmond has worked on in recent years. Here is Marsyas, the vast and strangely sexual sculpture made with Anish Kapoor for Tate Modern in 2002; it stretched, without obvious means of support, nearly the whole length of the Tate&apos;s enormous Turbine Hall. Here, too, is the Casa de Musica (2005), Porto, with Rem Koolhaas; designs for China Central Television&apos;s headquarters in Beijing; and those for the Taichung Metropolitan Opera House in Taiwan, with Toyo Ito. You might ask, having seen this show, why Balmond doesn&apos;t go it alone and design his own buildings without architects. After all, it seems odd that some of the most radical ideas for new buildings are evolving from the mind of an engineer - although, as Balmond points out, engineers such as Brunel prompted a revolution in architectural design, even though the effects were not really seen until the emergence of such talents as Norman Foster and Richard Rogers in the 1970s. Balmond&apos;s AGU did, in fact, design a very striking office block two years ago for what was to have been the redevelopment of the site around Battersea Power Station in London. The scheme fell through. Balmond had to learn the lesson that architects experience all too often: you can design wonderful schemes, but you are at the mercy of a less high-minded world of property development, finance and local authority planning. Balmond&apos;s strength is that he guides architects into uncertain terrain. Who else would have made it possible for the Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza to throw a net of the thinnest and most finely curved concrete across the open courtyard of his Portuguese pavilion at the 1998 Lisbon Expo? Local engineers said it was impossible. Concrete could never be so silkily fine, nor so curved over such a span. It would collapse. Balmond didn&apos;t think so. This daring and exquisite structure continues to defy belief. The Danish exhibition shows that this is only the beginning. Here we are given a picture of how architecture might develop in the next quarter of a century and beyond. It is a revolution - rich, complex, sometimes baffling, often beautiful - in the making. \u00b7 Cecil Balmond: Unfolding New Dimensions is at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark, until October 21. www.louisiana.dk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jul/24/news.awardsandprizes", "publicationDate": "2007-07-24T14:51:06Z", "tags": ["Books", "Awards and prizes", "Man Asian literary prize", "Culture"], "sentences": ["&quot;We are very pleased at the reception this inaugural Prize has received throughout the region and to see submissions from almost every country in Asia.&quot; While Guo is joined on the longlist by fellow compatriots Jiang Rong, Mo Yan and Xu Xi, and authors from Burma, Taiwan, the Philippines and Malaysia also make a showing, it is Indian writers who form the bulk of the longlist with a record 11 contenders."], "title": "Longlist for Man Asian literary prize announced", "article": "Xiaolu Guo, author of the Orange-shortlisted A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers, heads up the longlist for the inaugural Man Asian literary prize with a new novel, 20 Fragments of a Ravenous Youth.

(ftd.de). Lanci&apos;s main complaint is that people aren&apos;t buying new PCs to run Vista, and that it has had less of an impact on sales than previous versions of Windows. But Acer isn&apos;t suffering too badly. Gartner&apos;s research figures show that PC sales in the second quarter of this year were up 11.7% on last year, which is better than the 10.6% growth it predicted. Acer&apos;s worldwide PC shipments did even better, growing by 54.2% to 4.4m units. In Europe, where it is the third largest supplier, Acer grew by 36% in a market that increased by 13.5%, while in the US, Acer&apos;s shipments grew by 163.9%, according to Gartner. Microsoft also remains bullish. The local subsidiary told FT.de that Vista was a great success in Germany, while Microsoft UK says of its global figures: &quot;Demand is strong and we&apos;re pleased with the response to Windows Vista so far. For instance, we sold 20m copies in the first month of availability - a record - and nearly 40m as of mid-May.&quot; However, following last week&apos;s results, Microsoft&apos;s chief financial officer Chris Liddell said that, over the next year, he was budgeting for more sales of Windows XP than previously expected. &quot;We changed it from 85% to 78% [for Vista]. Now, it&apos;s a lower number, but it&apos;s still a very high number overall from our perspective, so 78% Vista mix in terms of sales next year.&quot; This doesn&apos;t make much difference to Microsoft. It only reduces its income insofar as Vista buyers are slightly more likely to buy a more expensive version of Vista. Indeed, by providing free downloads of things such as Microsoft.net 3.0, Internet Explorer 7 and Silverlight, Microsoft has provided some of Vista&apos;s benefits to some 550m XP users, reducing their need to upgrade. And there are several new versions of Windows on the way. Next month will see the arrival of Windows Home Server, providing automatic backups for home and small business users. This should be followed by a beta test version of Windows Vista Service Pack 1, though the final code may not appear until next year. Microsoft has also scheduled the release of Windows Server 2008 for early next year. The new version is already being used on Microsoft.com as a form of extreme stress testing. And following that is Windows 7, the next version of Vista, which has been thumbnailed in for 2010. Sorry, no more fancy codenames. Windows is now under the control of a new boss, Steven Sinofsky. He&apos;s famous for shipping numerous versions of Microsoft Office with impressive regularity and lack of fuss. If you liked Office 10, Office 11 and Office 12 then you could well like Windows 7, 8 and 9. \u00b7 If you&apos;d like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2007/jul/27/wecantsayitsuitsyousire", "publicationDate": "2007-07-27T08:00:38Z", "tags": ["Celebrity", "Life and style", "Elton John", "Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture"], "sentences": ["It was only three years ago that Elton had one of his episodes at Taiwan airport, screaming &quot;rude, vile pigs!&quot; at local photographers, before declaring that he would never return to Taiwan again."], "title": "We can't say it suits you, Sir Elton", "article": "Gingerly, now, to the obvious conundrum thrown up by Elton John&apos;s holiday wardrobe.

Around their necks hung luggage labels reading simply: &quot;Please Look After These Beckhams.&quot; So how&apos;s that one going? Well, last Sunday night saw the Beckhams&apos; big debutante ball at LA&apos;s Museum of Contemporary Art, at which Tom apparently re-enacted his Risky Business dance, forcing Lost in Showbiz to wonder how soon before his desire to impress the former England captain spins hopelessly out of control, sparking a chain of events that ends in a snowbound log cabin, with a heavily drugged David&apos;s attempt to contact Victoria being foiled by Tom, who uses a sledgehammer to permanently knacker his ankles while hissing: &quot;Oh, you dirty birdy, you! You&apos;re just another lying ol&apos; dirty birdy!&quot; For now, David&apos;s primary motivation for recovering from his current ankle injury remains a desire to avoid the alternative: namely, having to watch DVDs down in Tom&apos;s special den while the girls embark on one of their nine-hour shopping sprees. He&apos;s sure For Your Eyes Only didn&apos;t look like this last time he saw it. But his orange juice is making him feel too sleepy to say anything. But it&apos;s the rare moments that Tom&apos;s eyes are not upon them - although, what is that convex black glass disc in the centre of their bedroom ceiling? - that sparks our deepest fears for the Beckhams. Unless Lost in Showbiz is much mistaken, our perfect couple are locked in the sights of the three most powerfully corrosive energies in the city. Think of the Beckhams as Berlin in the spring of 1945, with the advancing allied generals played by Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears - ladies whose trainwreckery is believed to be so hopelessly infectious that the merest association with it could render them terminally ostracised from LA high society. And so to the Race for the Beckhams. According to reports, one of Lindsay&apos;s last acts before ... well, before the Unpleasantness, was to disclose her desire to seduce David, having apparently earmarked the Spice Girls end-of-year tour as the optimum time to make her move. (Seems unnecessarily complicated. Why not just disguise herself as the help and let nature take its course? I hear the household has a vacancy for an under-butler-cum-nail-technician.) Alas, following the starlet&apos;s arrest in the small hours of Tuesday for drink-driving, driving with a suspended licence, and having, like, someone else&apos;s blow in her pocket, Lindsay&apos;s end-of-year seduction opportunities would now appear to be limited to butch ladies who say &quot;purdy&quot; a lot and blow menacing kisses at you in the exercise yard. As for Paris, her initial assault has been repelled, with Victoria reportedly greeting the celebutante&apos;s suggestion to reporters that they could be soulmates with the words &quot;over my dead body&quot;. And Britney - whose continued meltdown we may have the energy to cover in some kind of billion-word write-thru next week - well, the moment she sat down at an adjoining restaurant table to the Beckhams this week, the couple got up and rushed into their people carrier. Coincidence? Or their understanding that the vehicle was the PR equivalent of the last helicopter out of Saigon? How long before one or other of our three hellcats lays a chill claw on their shoulders is anyone&apos;s guess. But the Beckhams are advised to harness the energies of newly converted US soccer fans, and use them to form a psychic cage around themselves at the earliest opportunity.

As if a dinner party needed more than one man nursing delusions of adequacy and given to bovine mugging for the camera. Still, the mere presence of this professional Boltonian&apos;s name on the list does finally answer a mutitude of questions, ranging from &quot;Who is the stupidest person ever to set foot in Chequers?&quot; to &quot;Are you now closer to understanding why Iraq is so thoroughly screwed?&quot; Carrey on trying to be funny, Jim There is heartwarming meta-news of Jim Carrey, whose ability to find a high-concept movie vehicle tailored to his comic genius remains undimmed by hilarity&apos;s repeated failure to ensue. This week - with the discreet fanfare likely to have been insisted upon by this least self-regarding of actors - the Hollywood Reporter reveals that Jim has signed on to appear in Yes Man, the story of a man who decides to say yes to everything. Let&apos;s support him. In opting for a movie premise that mirrors his career path in recent years, Jim signifies a new realism to his work, and it is to be hoped his constant lobbying for the Academy to institute an Oscar for best comic actor will now be quietly dropped.

In Essex parkland usually graced by the rock bands and groupies of the music festival season, 40,000 brightly-clothed scouts from more than 160 countries will today celebrate 100 years of the movement when Prince William and the Duke of Kent open the 10-day World Scout Jamboree. Yesterday, between munching apples, erecting tents and swapping woggles, Americans warmly greeted their French brethren and Scottish scouts delved into their sporrans to hand out pieces of tartan as the sound of young people singing in perfect harmony rose above Hylands Park, near Chelmsford. From Surinam to Taiwan, from Serbia to Libya, teenagers of all religions and all races were united under the scout promise and a shared experience: being misunderstood at school. &quot;My friends say that scouts are gay. Everyone says that,&quot; reckoned Rebecca Harding, 15, from south London. &quot;A lot of people try to hide the fact they are scouts.&quot; &quot;My friends don&apos;t like it. They say it is too tomboyish,&quot; added Sarah Burtt, 15. These 14- to 18-year-olds may be demonised for being good but they are determined to shrug off the dyb-dobbing, knot-tying stereotypes because, they declare, scouting is so much fun. What about illicit booze? &quot;We don&apos;t need it,&quot; said Sarah Chandler, 17, from Colchester. &quot;There&apos;s so much excitement it&apos;s really not necessary. We&apos;re not here to get drunk and stuff - we wouldn&apos;t remember any of it if we did.&quot; Scouting is desperate to shrug off the misconceptions that still cling to it. As a soldier, the founder, Robert Baden-Powell, had been so impressed with a brigade of small children who ran errands when he was besieged during the Boer war that in 1907 he gathered a group of 20 boys - from the working as well as the upper class - and took them camping on Brownsea Island in Dorset. He wrote Scouting for Boys the following year. It was an overnight sensation. Within three years there were more than 100,000 scouts. There are now 28 million across the world. Although in parts anachronistic, Baden-Powell&apos;s book is fourth in the all-time bestseller lists just behind the Bible, the Qur&apos;an and Mao Zedong&apos;s Little Red Book. &quot;He started a great thing. It fits all people, all races, all creeds, so he did something right,&quot; said Parker Vascik, a US scout from Virginia. The US scouts sit in their mess tent experimenting with smoky bacon-flavoured crisps. &quot;It tastes like a screwed-up barbecue,&quot; said one. It may have begun as a God-fearing boys-only adventure club with proficiency badges in stopping runaway horses and bugling but it is now a genuinely co-educational, multicultural vision of global good citizenship. Scouting has spread well beyond former colonies of the British empire. There are also more Muslim scouts than Christians. And the badges? Today&apos;s scouts pick up qualifications in administration or public relations or circus skills. &quot;I do not know how to tie any sort of knot,&quot; said Rosie Reynolds, 16, from Eltham in south London. &quot;I&apos;m not really ashamed of being a scout. You do it for the community thing - everyone is automatically friends because you&apos;re a scout.&quot; The spirit of friendship is everywhere. Scouts from all countries are high-fiving each other and welcoming people and inviting them to join games of football. If anyone is a bit tired or homesick, &quot;you can go up to anyone and give them a hug,&quot; said Lizzie Harvey from Hampshire. &quot;Young people to young people only,&quot; added Chris &quot;Fozzy&quot; Foster, the scout media officer, hurriedly. During the 10-day, \u00a320m (self-funded) jamboree, the scouts will undertake traditional &quot;adventures&quot;: a day of water sports and a day doing voluntary work in the community, dredging ponds, picking up litter or entertaining the residents of old people&apos;s homes. But they will also spend time in workshops, engaged in role plays to understand climate change, refugees and HIV/Aids. There will be drumming sessions with tuned plastic boomwhackers and doumbek skinned drums, arts and theatre and evening concerts. Liberty X and Lemar have already entertained the scouts, who are using the hi-tech stage that will be handed over to the V music festival in three weeks&apos; time. Is the jamboree really more enticing than a music festival? &quot;Don&apos;t tell anyone - I&apos;m hiding out in the bushes for three weeks until the V festival,&quot; said Hannah Gray, 17, from Aberdeenshire. She went to another music festival recently. &quot;It was very rushed. This is so much more relaxed and all the people are the same age.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s a global adventure and a global experience,&quot; said Derek Twine, chief executive of the UK Scout Association. UK membership has risen for three consecutive years and stands at 500,000. &quot;There&apos;s been an enormous shift to empowering young people rather than providing activities for them.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/jul/30/climatechangestudyignoredb", "publicationDate": "2007-07-30T05:30:49Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Two TV journalists in Taiwan have been arrested for fabricating a video purporting to show a gangster issuing threats against a rival."], "title": "Taiwan journalists accused of faking video", "article": "Two TV journalists in Taiwan have been arrested for fabricating a video purporting to show a gangster issuing threats against a rival.

His stuff skews towards the not-amazingly-useful, wacky anecdote side of things, but is rather fun, and there&apos;s nothing wrong with that. Look, he even poses naked smothered in guidebooks. Who says Lonely Planet is boring? The best bits are Brown&apos;s behind-the-scenes moments, applying a more personal slant to places that, one assumes, will turn up in the guide in a slightly more wing-clipped format. On Lanyu, a &quot;volcanic, mountainous island covered with a carpet of tropical rain forest&quot;, Brown finds himself a bit weirded out. His coverage of certain cultural landmarks in the country is fascinating, and he openly admits that things in Taiwan are changing too quickly for him to keep up. Enter the Blogistas  Small-scope blogs really do it for me, the more specific the better. An emailed heads-up sent me towards the small-scoped, award-winning Our Man In Granada, courtesy of Steve Jackson, currently a volunteer for a street kid restaurant in Nicaragua, and formerly Our Man in Hanoi.  Jackson&apos;s take on all things &quot;Nica&quot; is a great read for anyone planning to visit the country, from the quirky joys of Nica buses to the intriguing world of Nica Cowboys. And best of all, Our Man is quite the photographer, as his flickr sets prove. The adjective-infused Patagonia Living is another great Latin American blog, maintained by Frommers writer Christie Pashby. Her posts tend to gush a little, but are well worth a browse - including the discovery of the Estancia Chilceneyen, a seemingly endless ranch in the Patagonian Steppe. Vice goes soft  It was a real double-take moment. Vice, home of all things indulgent and sickeningly trendy, recently ran a post on their blog on something a bit \u2026 no! \u2026 cerebral. The post links to a fascinating photo story on Nuwara Eliya, a &quot;town in Sri Lanka where the British colonial way of life carries on just as it did in the early part of the last century.&quot; A quick re-read and there it was. No expos\u00e9s on horse-techno, no happy-slapping, just really interesting stuff.  And not an isolated incident either. After a bit of an archive search I stumbled upon an interview they ran with George Whitman, proprietor of the Shakespeare &amp; Co bookshop and ex-beatnik haven in Paris. Astonishing stuff. The first comment on the latter post says it all: &quot;Wow, an article that isn&apos;t about a dwarf being sick, or a Jewish Nazi \u2026 more like this please&quot;. And finally\u2026 Every now and then I&apos;ll find myself stuck on a blog. This isn&apos;t supposed to happen - we blog-surfers rarely loiter on one site for too long. (Short attention spans or broad interests? You decide.) This week&apos;s time-wasters were Road Junky&apos;s Gonzo Travel Writing Shortlist, and Brave New Traveller&apos;s Tales From the Road.

Conventional wisdom has been that Google would concentrate on software for a mobile phone, pitching it against Windows Mobile and, of course, Apple&apos;s iPhone. Up to now, Google has only appeared on mobiles through search or map applications. According to the Wall Street Journal, Google has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in mobile and is already talking to European mobile operators. One Anian analyst said Google is working with Taiwan&apos;s HTC - whose new-ish touch-screen thing I&apos;m playing with at the moment - to develop the handset. HTC currently uses Windows Mobile, but Google is developing a Linux-based handset. The idea is to make it mass-market, rather than high-end like the iPhone, and to tap the massive potential market for mobile advertising: Google chief executive Eric Schmidt recently described mobile advertising as twice as profitable because it can be so personalised. The gPhone would have the familiar search and email services as well as a new mobile web browser, with the operating systems and specifications adaptable for multiple devices and operators. At the earliest, the phones would come to market in early 2008. Prototypes so far have looked like the BlackBerry or a Nokia with a keyboard. To add to all that, Google recently announced it may bid for wireless spectrum licences in the US - which would mean becoming a mobile operator in its own right. That would take years and billions of dollars, but would mean Google would not have to negotiate (and share ad revenues) with other operators. As for my iPhone-killing HTC Touch, I dunno. It has this neat function where you scrawl words on the screen and it neatly translates those into words on screen (it&apos;s about 70% accurate, which is pretty good considering my handwriting) and also has this swivelling cube navigation thing when t=you swipe you thumb across the screen. But all my contacts and calendars are on my Macs and my iPod, so there&apos;s no compatibility. HTC regularly manufactures and rebrands its devices for other firms, so this all fits. But let&apos;s wait and see.

YouTube accounts for more than a fifth of all video viewed online, and Yahoo plans to add more film trailers, music videos, TV shows and sports highlights to compete. The firm already has deals with several music companies and film studios including Universal and EMI.

NetVibes is a web aggregator which allows users to customise their page using hundreds of widgets and feeds. Most of the fuss around Facebook widgets has been focused around developers bringing their sites into Facebook through widgets, rather than taking content out, although Facebook has offered several desktop and site widgets even before the big platform launch. There&apos;s a whole world of Facebook applications to take your content out - like Fonebook, which copies your contacts details out of Facebook to Outlook- and a photos plugin that allows you to blog your Facebook photos. It does not, however, allow developers access to the Facebook newsfeed - the list of everything your friends have done of Facebook recently - because that&apos;s one of the most interestingly features.

But the Swiss army knife, considered by millions around the world to be an indispensable tool, is in danger of losing its Swiss identity. The Swiss army, which is to order a fresh batch of 65,000 of the pocket knives with new specifications, has caused nationwide consternation by declaring that under World Trade Organisation rules, the tendering process must be opened to companies worldwide because of the high value of the contract. China, which has been producing pirate copies of the knife for years, is thought to have the best chance of winning the contract, which is estimated at 1.7m Swiss francs (\u00a3695,000), followed by Taiwan and Bulgaria. The issue has become one of the hottest political topics of the summer, with far-right politicians saying that national pride is at stake. &quot;If the Swiss army knife no longer comes from Switzerland, then we might as well stop producing it altogether,&quot; said Thomas Fuchs, MP for the far-right Swiss People&apos;s party. Alois Kessler, a lawyer and a former colonel in the Swiss army, has taken up the campaign and launched a nationwide petition, Keep Soldiers&apos; Pocket Knives Swiss! He said he had found that under WTO rules &quot;stabbing weapons&quot; - among them the Swiss army knife - are on a list of products that do not need to be put out to tender. &quot;I simply cannot imagine our soldiers carrying a Made in China knife in their knapsacks,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be like us giving them German-made chocolate.&quot; The army is saying little, except that it is working on the technical specifications for the new product to make it suitable for modern soldiering, including a serrated blade with a locking mechanism, a saw, and a Phillips - crosshead - screwdriver. It should also have a case, allowing it to be attached to a belt. Victorinox, the company that makes the knives, said it was confident it would win the bid on the combined factors of quality and cost. The knife, which was first produced in Ibach in the canton of Schwyz in 1897, can be equipped with anything from a nail file and a tin opener to a fish-scaler and a USB stick, and features in the design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. It is credited by everyone from balloonists and astronauts to surgeons and pilots with saving lives and is the official pocket knife for 16 armies around the world, including the US military. It has also prompted many jokes, perceived as it is as the weapon of choice for the military of neutral Switzerland. The US comedian Robin Williams once quipped: &quot;How can you trust an army that has a wine opener on its knife?&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/06/pressandpublishing.guardianobituaries", "publicationDate": "2007-08-05T23:02:01Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "sentences": ["His long involvement with television documentaries in Britain and France ended when he suffered a stroke while reporting for a film on the sale of French frigates to Taiwan, a scandal involving kickbacks that besmirched the final years of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand."], "title": "Obituary: Edward Behr", "article": "Edward Behr, who has died aged 81, was the consummate foreign correspondent in the golden age, now fast disappearing in the wake of media empire cost-cutting. For nearly a half century, Behr reported on almost every conflict worth covering for American news magazines, notably Time and Newsweek. He also worked on acclaimed television documentaries for the BBC and French television. But his forte was covering conflicts. That he did brilliantly from India to Vietnam, from Northern Ireland to Algeria and the Congo and beyond. Behr made his reputation in North Africa covering the twilight of French colonialism during the Algerian war of independence from 1954 to 1962 for Time. A small, round, bespectacled man, Behr was a member of the so-called Maghreb Circus, a talented if raffish collection of mainly French correspondents constantly on the move, following the latest developments in Algiers, Rabat and Tunis. His often hilarious experiences gathered when covering dozens of conflicts provided fodder for arguably the funniest book on war reporting since Evelyn Waugh&apos;s Scoop. &quot;Anyone here been raped and speak English?&quot; was the war reporter&apos;s irreverent but eminently practical question, and became the title of his book. The question was shouted out to hundreds of just rescued European survivors of a siege at Stanleyville in eastern Congo in November 1964 as they disembarked from US Air Force C-130s landing. His American publisher in 1978 made Behr change the title to Bearings: A Foreign Correspondent&apos;s Life Behind the Lines, which crimped sales. Behr was not amused and immediately changed it back in all other editions, and they sold briskly outside the US. Behr was born in Paris to a Russian-Jewish family and studied at the prestigious lyc\u00e9e Jeanson-de-Sailly. When German troops occupied Paris, the family was denounced by their concierge. They escaped to London where he was educated at St Paul&apos;s school. Called up for military service in 1944, Behr added Urdu to his fluent English, French and German, and served as an intelligence officer with the Indian army&apos;s Garhwal Regiment, eventually rising to major. In 1945 he was assigned to a British force overseeing the capitulation of Japanese occupation troops, first in Indonesia, then in Indochina, at the end of the second world war. He loved recounting how he liberated one Indonesian island, replacing the Japanese occupation yen with Monopoly money. This story was typical of the pixieish sense of humour he used to steady the nerves of fellow correspondents witnessing horrendous acts of violence. Unlike many colleagues who became inured to the violence, Behr never forgot his horror in firing - and ordering his men to fire - on both Muslims and Hindus during the violent partition of British India in 1947. Demobilised and back in England, he read history at Magdalene College, Cambridge. His first steps in journalism were with Reuters in London, then in Paris under the notoriously overbearing bureau chief Harold King, who drove many a young correspondent to despair. By 1954, Behr left to become press spokesman for Jean Monnet, a leading French proponent of European unity who became the first president of the Coal and Steel Community, itself the kernel of what eventually became the European Union. In 1957 he joined Time, covering the Algerian war and among other conflicts the border clash in 1962 between India and China. He later did a brief stint with the Saturday Evening Post, America&apos;s oldest magazine, and in 1965 joined Newsweek, where he remained for 20 years. He was the magazine&apos;s bureau chief in Delhi, Paris and Hong Kong before becoming the first editor of the international edition for Europe. In one of his favourite scoops, Behr inveigled his way into an official French delegation in Beijing which met Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution in the mid-1960s. Behr&apos;s warts-and-all account of the Chinese leader contrasted with the flattering portrait that Andr\u00e9 Malraux, then President Charles de Gaulle&apos;s culture minister, included in his largely fictional account in Antim\u00e9moires (1967). Behr was a prolific writer of books, starting with The Algerian Problem, a well-reviewed account of the Algerian war in 1961, the year before the conflict ended with Algerian independence. His palette was varied. He wrote a book to accompany Bernardo Bertolucci&apos;s film The Last Emperor (1987); an expos\u00e9 of the alleged war guilt of Japanese ruler entitled Hirohito: Behind the Myth (1989); and another, Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite: The Rise and Fall of the Ceausescus (1991), the dictatorial family that had ruled communist Romania. His long involvement with television documentaries in Britain and France ended when he suffered a stroke while reporting for a film on the sale of French frigates to Taiwan, a scandal involving kickbacks that besmirched the final years of President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. He is survived by his French wife of many years, Christiane. \u00b7 Edward Behr, foreign correspondent and writer, born May 7 1926; died May 26 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/08/thechinasyndrome", "publicationDate": "2007-08-08T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Banks and building societies", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["On July 19, the UN ambassadors of Swaziland and the Solomon Islands took a letter from President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan asking for admission to the United Nations - under the name of Taiwan, not the traditional designation that the deceased president, Chiang Kai-shek, had lumbered the island with, the Republic of China.", "The UN claims that resolution 2758 which seated the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1971, precludes Taiwan&apos;s membership.", "Ironically Chiang&apos;s delegation only used their veto in the security council once - against the admission of Mongolia, which they considered as integral a part of the &quot;one China&quot; as the PRC now considers Taiwan!", "Both Taiwan and the PRC have seen the light since.", "Taiwan no longer claims the mainland, let alone Mongolia, and Beijing and Bangladesh are quite prepared to maintain what have now become &quot;traditional&quot;, friendly relations.", "But then neither has any state complained that the UN&apos;s department of public information bans reporters from Taiwan on the totally spurious grounds that only reporters with a UN member state passport can attend, as the CPJ has so eloquently complained.", "So Taiwanese passport-holders and journalists can go to China - but not to the UN!", "In contrast, when China has threatened to veto UN operations in Haiti because of the Haitian recognition of Taiwan, the Latin American and Caribbean states have called its bluff and made it plain that that China would lose friends.", "But for the UN secretariat to connive at stifling the debate is a threat to the principles of the organisation, just as its treatment of Taiwanese journalists makes a mockery of its annual celebration of World Press Freedom day."], "title": "The China syndrome", "article": "On July 19, the UN ambassadors of Swaziland and the Solomon Islands took a letter from President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan asking for admission to the United Nations - under the name of Taiwan, not the traditional designation that the deceased president, Chiang Kai-shek, had lumbered the island with, the Republic of China. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon refused to accept the letter. George Orwell would love the excuses. The spokeswoman for the secretary general of the UN said, &quot;It&apos;s really up to the Member States of this Organization to decide on the future course of how it deals with new membership&quot;. This did not really explain why he would not put the letter before the members of the general assembly. The UN claims that resolution 2758 which seated the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1971, precludes Taiwan&apos;s membership. This is highly arguable. It quite rightly said that the PRC delegates were the &quot;only lawful representatives&quot; of China to the UN, and decided to &quot;expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek&quot;. But how much has changed since 1971! Firstly, the &quot;representatives of Chiang Kai-shek&quot; lost in democratic elections, and the elected government of Taipei has no pretence whatsoever to represent the Chinese mainland. Ironically Chiang&apos;s delegation only used their veto in the security council once - against the admission of Mongolia, which they considered as integral a part of the &quot;one China&quot; as the PRC now considers Taiwan! With equal irony, the first veto from the PRC&apos;s delegation was against the membership of Bangladesh. What was then Peking saw no reason why the genocidal behaviour by Pakistan&apos;s generals against the citizenry of what was then East Pakistan in any way affected the &quot;one Pakistan policy&quot;. Both Taiwan and the PRC have seen the light since. Taiwan no longer claims the mainland, let alone Mongolia, and Beijing and Bangladesh are quite prepared to maintain what have now become &quot;traditional&quot;, friendly relations. The UN bureaucracy&apos;s hypocritical response is an assault upon the principles of the UN charter. Resolution 2758 does not say what the Chinese say it does, and even if it did, it is like any other resolution, always open to question, amendment and rescission. It was the laws of the Medes and Persians that could not be rescinded, not UN resolutions. Indeed, to cover Israel&apos;s defiance of so many of them, the US now claims that general assembly resolutions are not binding! None of the security council members such as the US have protested at this arbitrary withdrawal of the prerogative of members to put items on the agenda or to discuss previous resolutions. As always there is a certain lack of consistency. No one said, for example, that the zionism is racism resolution of 1975 could not be rescinded, certainly not the US, which successfully moved to do just that in possibly the shortest ever resolutions. &quot;The General Assembly decides to revoke the determination contained in its resolution 3379 (XXX) of 10 November 1975&quot;. But then neither has any state complained that the UN&apos;s department of public information bans reporters from Taiwan on the totally spurious grounds that only reporters with a UN member state passport can attend, as the CPJ has so eloquently complained. Once again, the UN inappropriately cites that Swiss army knife of a resolution, 2758, which seems have a tool to extricate bureaucrats and diplomats from dragons&apos; claws. So Taiwanese passport-holders and journalists can go to China - but not to the UN! One only hopes that the last few microstates, like Niue or the Cook Islands, can rustle up a correspondent to test the integrity of the UN&apos;s rules. Indeed it will be interesting to see what happens to Kosovan media when the US recognises Kosovo&apos;s independence, and the Russians veto its UN membership. The reflexive deference to China is bad for the US, the UN and the world. Beijing always comes back for more. In contrast, when China has threatened to veto UN operations in Haiti because of the Haitian recognition of Taiwan, the Latin American and Caribbean states have called its bluff and made it plain that that China would lose friends. It backed down. Beijing is entitled to use its considerable influence on the floor of the general assembly. For the foreseeable future it will probably succeed in keeping 23 million people and one of the world&apos;s most advanced economies in a state of multilateral limbo. But for the UN secretariat to connive at stifling the debate is a threat to the principles of the organisation, just as its treatment of Taiwanese journalists makes a mockery of its annual celebration of World Press Freedom day. To be fair, Ban Ki-moon is only following in the footsteps that his predecessors should have shamefully concealed. One wishes he had the courage to blaze a new trail."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/aug/09/china.jonathanwatts7", "publicationDate": "2007-08-08T23:09:00Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Plans to take the torch through Taiwan have also stirred up cold-war rivalries, but this is not the only politically sensitive issue."], "title": "Welcome to Beijing", "article": "For any host, the Olympics is more than a sporting event. But for China, it is a coming-of-age party, a chance to reclaim a place for this ancient nation among the world&apos;s most advanced civilisations - as the country&apos;s economic and sporting power are pushed to the forefront of global consciousness like never before. Starting today, China is counting down to the biggest and most expensive Olympics in the history of the games. From the opening ceremony at -Beijing&apos;s already iconic new stadium on August 8 next year, these games will stretch more than 2,000km between the athletics, gymnastics and swimming in the national capital to the equestrian events in Hong Kong - and stretch across more venues than ever before too, with football stadiums in Shanghai and yachting courses in north Qingdao. As well as the spectacular \u00a3208m &quot;bird&apos;s nest&quot; main stadium, Beijing is spending between \u00a320bn and \u00a335bn to accelerate the development of vast swaths of this 3,000-year-old city. Ahead of schedule, workers are now putting the finishing touches to new roads, subway lines, airport terminals and hotels. Even before the first event starts, the scale of China&apos;s ambitions will be apparent in the longest and most controversial torch relay ever. A new motorway is being built to the Everest base camp to smooth the path of bearers scheduled to carry the flame up the world&apos;s highest peak from Nepal, and down the north face into Tibet. Plans to take the torch through Taiwan have also stirred up cold-war rivalries, but this is not the only politically sensitive issue. As the first Olympics in a communist state since Moscow in 1980, a battle looms over the message of the 2008 games. For the ruling party, it is the ultimate propaganda opportunity to show the government&apos;s success in lifting hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. For Tibetan independence activists, human rights campaigners, supporters of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement, persecuted peasants and environmentalists, it is a chance to expose the dark side of the planet&apos;s biggest one-party state. But perhaps more than anything, it will show how China&apos;s market reforms, begun 30 years ago, have transformed the country into one of the great centres of globalisation; how movement - from the countryside to the city, and between the homeland and the rest of the world - has changed millions of lives. The Guardian spoke to those working and living closest to the games - the people of -Beijing - about their lives and how the games have touched them.

When Zhou celebrated his 38th birthday yesterday, it was at a special party for 10 &quot;Olympic families&quot;, who were selected from all over the country and treated to a tour to the games sites of Hong Kong, Qingdao and Shanghai. For Zhou, the 2008 event is about a great deal more than sport. &quot;I think there is some fate linking me and the Olympics. I think I was born for the Olympics,&quot; says the physical education instructor. &quot;I started to feel like this in 2001, when China won the right to host the games.&quot; It was July 13 and he was watching TV in bed when that announcement came. It changed his life. &quot;I literally jumped with joy. Then I went to Tiananmen Square. There must have been more than 100,000 people. It was a sea of humanity. It gave me the feeling that the Olympics can unite people&apos;s hearts.&quot; Ever since, he has made it his mission to spread the gospel of the games. Starting with the school where he works, Zhou has taken every opportunity to promote what he calls an Olympic education. &quot;I have the -Olympic spirit and I put it into practice. I hope I can use it to inspire people all over the country and the world.&quot; Spending so much of his pay that he has had arguments with his wife, Zhou designed and financed an Olympic garden in the school yard, which is now decorated with 108 posters -illustrating the history, ethos, events, medals, mascots, pins and other details of the games.  &quot;Every new student is taken here as their -primary introduction to the educational philosophy of our school. We don&apos;t see it as a contradiction to patriotism. If you love the world and love nature and the environment, then it helps us to love our country the right way,&quot; he says. &quot;We let students touch the images on the posters. Then they make duplicates with recycled material. We make our own equipment and medals.&quot; The school has also staged its own mini-Olympics with the original five events from ancient Greece. The discus and javelin were made from discarded cardboard, plastic bottles and tape. &quot;I believe that when the Olympics comes to China the main objective should be to bring goodness in a practical way. The environment is a worldwide concern. We want the Olympics to make our country greener and healthier. That is why we mixed physical education with caring for the environment.&quot; Such efforts have brought good publicity to the school, which has been -visited by several dignitaries, including Britain&apos;s Olympics minister Tessa Jowell. His next goal is to take part in the Olympic torch relay. &quot;Any part would be OK, but I would love to carry it in Taiwan. We are in a global -village. No matter where people come from, if they are kind and love peace then they are our friends. Taiwan is part of China. We still want to make friends with them.&quot; The Olympics, he says, is inspired by angels. He credits it with bringing harmony to his workplace and home. He says his wife now supports his work, despite her earlier doubts. &quot;Wherever the Olympics goes it brings only sunshine, -happiness and progress.&quot; But when the games starts next year, he does not expect to be able to get to any of the events. &quot;In recent years, I have devoted so much money and energy to Olympic education, I won&apos;t have anything left to buy tickets.

Military exercises, dubbed Peace Mission 2007 and involving 6,500 troops and 80 aircraft from China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, began today in Chelyabinsk, in Russia&apos;s Ural region. For the SCO, initiated in 1996 to defuse Sino-Russian territorial disputes, the war games mark its most ambitious attempt yet to build an integrated military security apparatus to complement expanding political and commercial collaboration. &quot;The drill shows that SCO cooperation over security has gone beyond the issues of regional disarmament and borders for it includes how to deal with non-traditional threats such as terrorists, secessionist forces and extreme religious groups,&quot; China Daily said.

Disturbingly perhaps for Nato commanders in Kabul, SCO leaders say they will seek &quot;a closer partnership with Afghanistan in the framework of the SCO-Afghanistan contact group&quot;. Nearly 20 years after it retreated, Russia seems intent on returning to Afghanistan. The Bishkek summit will also be attended by representatives of Iran, Pakistan, and Mongolia, which have applied to join the SCO, and India. Ednan Karabayev, the Kyrgyz foreign minister, said this showed how important the organisation was becoming. &quot;Nowadays the SCO has already become an influential new-type international organisation, which is based upon new values and goals.

For the SCO, initiated in 1996 to defuse Sino-Russian territorial disputes, the war games mark its most ambitious attempt yet to build an integrated military-security apparatus to complement expanding political and commercial collaboration. &quot;The drill shows that SCO cooperation over security has gone beyond the issues of regional disarmament and borders for it includes how to deal with non-traditional threats such as terrorists, secessionist forces and extreme religious groups,&quot; China Daily said.

Such exercises have never targeted a third country.&quot; The SCO&apos;s annual heads of state summit, to be held in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, next week provides further indications of the organisation&apos;s expansive ideas.

Disturbingly perhaps for Nato commanders in Kabul, SCO leaders say they will seek &quot;a closer partnership with Afghanistan in the framework of the SCO-Afghanistan contact group&quot;. Nearly 20 years after it retreated, Russia seems intent on returning to Afghanistan. The Bishkek summit will also be attended by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, as well as senior figures from Pakistan and Mongolia - all of which have applied to join the SCO - and India.

There I was waiting all day for the CD - which trails a new greatest hits - to be delivered. I was like a little kid. I suppose I was thinking that a remixed Dylan might throw some light on Dylan himself, the way he wrote a song, turned a phrase, cornered a melody, sourced a rhythm; it might offer a couple of clues about the way he approximately mixes his own historical songs when he plays them live. I was looking forward to a new animal, maybe a new species, even if it was posh-eyed boy Ronson doing the remixing. Perhaps, as it was Ronson, it would be just a facial - a neatening of the eyebrows, a removal of a few wrinkles. Maybe it was just going to be a clearing of the throat. But still, a remix of a Dylan track doesn&apos;t come along too often, and even though I might have chosen Xiu Xiu or Panda Bear to have done the mix, there&apos;s something about using pop&apos;s sonic valet to the stars that connects the Dylan dots with Victoria&apos;s Secret using Dylan music, and Starbucks stocking his songs. You can follow those dots all the way back to when Dylan went electric, even further back to when he stole words and melodies to get a head start in the business, so surely some jolting Dylan business was afoot. Perhaps this would be yet another new sign of how Dylan, ghosting his own life story, like he&apos;s got something to do with it, is aligning himself with various realities as he prepares for iconic life after death. He&apos;s covering all possibilities, making sure even lovers of modern novelty pop are just about aware that he turned up just in time to be himself, a mortal enemy of sentimentality. I like rich Ronson when he dolls up Lily and Amy on his own obvious frothy albums, confirming with a thin slice of panache that the girls are really just soft-core novelties. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that, per se, give or take, within reason. I like the way he blasts Coldplay into retro-groovy James Last territory - I think of him as a kind of post-Fatboy James Last, in fact, making throwaway party music by mixing up Flatboy slimming beats with full fat Last brass that has a faint sheen of something possibly once hip. I still optimistically thought that his mix of Dylan might take some kind of biscuit. I was wrong. It doesn&apos;t know what to do with the biscuit, except leave crumbs. I played it straight away. It sprang into dullness. It sounded like a cover version of a Dylan song done by a Graham Parker and the Rumour tribute band, except, which was not quite strange and vaudevillian enough to make it something, Dylan himself was singing. It was like an extremely distracted Dylan was doing a karoake version of one of his own songs to a backing tape made in Taiwan by a team of people who had only heard one pop song in their life and that was by Bad Manners. There are those wonky-tonk hack Stax brass swoops Ronson is infatuated with, which sound fine mirroring Lily&apos;s sit-comic cuteness but which make Dylan seem plain grumpy. It&apos;s like Rolf Harris got hold of something by Rothko, whitewashed it and added a smiley face. I even took it to New York and played it there, thinking that might add some spice. Damn thing sounded even worse there, as if Ronson had not only let all the air out of the song, but all the space, time and acidic wonder. Luckily, there&apos;s still the upcoming Todd Haynes Dylan film I&apos;m Not There to look forward to. All those actors and egos adopting masks and bravado to play the patient, pensive Dylan in various dismantled states of age, certainty, gender and shock; I&apos;m excited. Hopefully Haynes&apos;s film will make a better, madder, stab than dandy Ronson at wondering just where, and how, Dylan is hiding."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/13/thetoriesvulcandeathgrip", "publicationDate": "2007-08-13T18:00:00Z", "tags": ["Conservatives", "David Cameron", "Politics", "European Union", "George Osborne"], "sentences": ["Poland with a GDP growth rate of 7.4%, and the Czech Republic with 6.1%, are doing better than Asian tigers like Korea and Taiwan."], "title": "The Tories' Vulcan death grip", "article": "Enjoy your bucket and spade while ye may. The Vulcan is back and wants to take away your holidays. You might have thought the Tory barmy army had run out of feet in which to shoot themselves. But up pop the dynamic duo of John Redwood and George Osborne to tell the millions of Brits enjoying weeks of sun abroad and days of rain back home that the brief period when we had the legal rights to four weeks paid holiday a year are soon to be suspended by the Conservatives. Today in the Financial Times, George Osborne announces he wants to pick a fight with Europe. Yawn, yawn. Anti-European outfits are always announcing their fight with the EU. Open Europe, which specialises in closed minds on Euro reality, does so every day. According to the latest register of MPs&apos; interests, William Hague has made just short of a cool quarter of a million pounds from speeches in the last 12 months, and he never gets close to a microphone without his quips about foreigners and Europeans from the Les Dawson scrap book of xenophobic jokes ready to be deployed. We are used to Tory fibs on Europe, and the Observer leader on Sunday was right to rebuke Cameron for his dishonesty on the new EU treaty. But obsessing on Europe did William Hague no good when he led the party to Labour&apos;s second landslide victory in 2001. Remember his anti-EU rhetoric? &quot;I warn the British people that if they vote Labour, Britain will become a foreign land,&quot; intoned our William. Well they did, and Britain didn&apos;t. Now the Tories are at it again. Almost every day in August there has been an attack on Europe. William Hague fills the pages of the anti-EU press with his denunciations of the new EU treaty. Now George Osborne announces he wants a new fight with Europe. He says he will break existing agreements with Europe in the employment field. This is in line with the slow leak of the report by John Redwood, who is meant to be guiding Tory policy to new heights. In fact, the only strong point in his report is for Britain to pull out of EU social chapter obligations. Redwood, the Vulcanesque nemesis of John Major, is an obsessive anti-European. He wonderfully said that signing the treaty of Amsterdam (anyone remember that one?) meant &quot;the end of Britain&quot;. I think we&apos;re still here. But are the Tories wise to announce the end of the social chapter? The part of social chapter legislation that really impacts on UK citizens is the right to a statutory four weeks holiday. Paid holidays in Britain in the past were based on agreement, custom and practice, before Labour signed the EU social chapter in 1997 and made them law and mandatory. If Tories pull out of the social chapter then any exploitative employer - and alas there are many more of them around than the CBI and other bosses&apos; outfits care to admit - can decide not to allow workers paid holidays. You would not know it from the rhetoric of ministers since 1997, but it is thanks to Britain signing up to the EU social chapter there are now four weeks&apos; statutory paid holidays plus pay on bank holidays, which did not exist as legal rights before 1997. There is an iron rule of European politics which is that anything good emerging from the EU is immediately pocketed by national governments and presented as a wise and generous action by national ministers: when anything bad happens, national ministers duck under the duvet, and start moaning about the bossy EU commission. But on paid holidays - now under threat from the Conservatives - it is the EU we need to thank, along with the courage of Labour in those far-off days of 1997 when we were proud to be a pro-European party and enjoyed castigating the Euro-scepticism of John Redwood, William Hague and their staff ideologues, such as George Osborne and David Cameron. There is no evidence that allowing families and individuals to have legal paid holidays has done any damage to employers or to the British economy and Labour market. EU rules also protect workers against discrimination and encourage workplace consultation and, again, there is no evidence this has hurt the economy. Only someone with the unwavering political misjudgment of John Redwood and George Osborne would come up with an idea to attack EU rights to paid holidays in the middle of August. With luck, Dave Cameron won&apos;t u-turn on this latest hardline rightwing proposal. Labour should pray that the Tory leadership endorses this return to the unflinching hatred of workers and their unions associated with the Conservative past. We should get every bucket and spade vote from Cornwall to the Canary Islands if the Tories decide removing EU social rights to statutory paid holidays is a vote winner. Andrew Gilligan is no friend of Labour, but he protests in the Evening Standard that the Redwood-Osborne proposals to axe laws which give workers basic rights are crazy. Gilligan rightly points out that the 1974 Health and Safety Act protects all employees from dangerous practices which lead to fingers, or limbs, being cut off, workers falling from dodgy ladders, and RSI being rampant for keyboard slaves. Employers have also had to help with rules on lifting heavy loads or exposure to noisy environments, so that backs would not be turned to agony, or hearing lost. There is a wider problem on Europe that the Tories do not understand. The picture the Eurosceptic newspapers - and that includes most who write on economics and business - paint is out-of-date. Check the current issue of the Economist if you do not believe me. The pages at the back which print stats show the EU currently growing at nearly twice the rate of the US and well ahead of Japan. Britain is up there as a stellar economic performer - EU social chapter and health and safety rules included - but Germany, Austria and Sweden are out-performing the UK. Poland with a GDP growth rate of 7.4%, and the Czech Republic with 6.1%, are doing better than Asian tigers like Korea and Taiwan. In my own constituency of Rotherham, where steel output is vital, Europe remains the most important market for British steel. In 2006, there was a 16% increase in steel exports to EU member states compared to an 18% drop in exports to the rest of the world. Today UK steel is exporting \u00a31bn more in value than under the Tories and the big market remains the EU. We keep hearing that the future lies with China and India but we export eight times as much steel to Europe as we do to Asia. Those who continually decry the EU, and say it has no future, are doing great damage to the UK steel industry. In short, Europe is back. That is why President Bush and his father hosted President Sarkozy of France for lunch at their holiday home in Maine over the weekend. Washington, both under Bush and whoever succeeds, is looking for new friends and partners in Europe. For the Tories to start launching anti-European crusades, whether attempting to do away with the right of EU social chapter rights on paid holidays, or their call for a populist referendum to derail the new treaty (in the process defeating Gordon Brown&apos;s insistence that parliament should ratify international treaties) is a reversion to the form of Tory politics that destroyed the Major government. As a Labour MP I have to pray that the new Osborne-Redwood axis continues to drive the wheels of the Tory jalopy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/17/wecamewesawweshouldnthav", "publicationDate": "2007-08-17T12:00:00Z", "tags": ["Travel"], "sentences": ["The Taroko Gorge, Taiwan?"], "title": "We came, we saw, we shouldn't have", "article": "If only the climate camp protesters really could save us suffering British tourists from ourselves. We have reached the promised lands of Times Square, the Pyramids and the Ramblas, only to label them disappointing. It should surprise no one. Disappointment follows sightseeing as surely as night follows day. An industry of aviation, tour operators, hustlers, guides and souvenir sellers conspire to funnel us holidaymakers, supposedly enjoying our own &quot;free&quot; time, inexorably towards the sights. As if uneasy away from the shackles of work and home, the sightseer allows him or herself to be drilled into another set of conventions and rules. Would they know if they had actually seen a &quot;sight&quot; unless it was so designated with the postcard? The French, whose prize assets take a pasting in the poll, might understand our disillusion better than us. Sightseeing is the cheap one-night stand of travel, getting up close and stripping away the mystery of a distant object of desire in an act of functional congress, a briefly fulfilling but ultimately melancholic petite mort. Too often, it&apos;s little more than ticking another one off the list. Anyone who has visited the chief villains on that list would agree that, yes, the Statue of Liberty, like other American icons, is smaller than you&apos;d imagine and the Louvre more overcrowded than you&apos;d wish. And yes, visitors, it is a pity that the ancient Britons built Stonehenge so close to the A303. Surely, though, Gustav Eiffel&apos;s extraordinary creation can only have hit the top spot in the poll by having had most visitors, disappointed or otherwise, rather than any intrinsic flaw. To appreciate true tourist disappointment, I can point you here. Or here. Or in particular, here. Engaging in sightseeing away from the biggies may seem like an opportunity to discover a rare jewel on the B-list, but tends to be an expensive, time-consuming mistake, especially in locations where you would really rather be on the beach. Perhaps the most instructive part of the poll is what our disappointed explorers have labelled the top ten must-sees: the obscure, the uncrowded. The Jungfraujoch railway, Switzerland? The Taroko Gorge, Taiwan? It all smacks of the Thingyoudon&apos;tknow, in Somewhereyouhaven&apos;tbeen. It&apos;s more about finding something faintly OK before anyone else does; the kind of mild, pointless frisson of excitement felt by the first 1980s Briton to eat guacamole, and then presumably to label prawn cocktail &quot;disappointing&quot;.

Above his head is a sign in Chinese characters. In translation, the sign reads: &apos;Mr Yang. The man who found the Terracotta Army&apos;. Mr Yang, a thin, weathered man in his seventies, was an accidental archaeologist. His smile suggests that he still can hardly believe his luck. Yang was a farmer on the grey plains outside Xian, the ancient capital of China. Legend had long had it that ghosts inhabited the dry soil on which he worked. One day, in March 1974, when digging for a well, Yang came face to face with one of these ghosts: a clay soldier that had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years. He and three other farmers had chanced upon the entrance to a huge vault, which was eventually discovered to contain more than 6,000 such figures and which provided an unprecedented insight into the genesis of the Chinese nation. The warriors were part of the vast burial site of the first Chinese Emperor Qin (pronounced &apos;Chin&apos;) Shihuang, who had united six warring states into one territory that he ruled for 11 years from 221 BC. Those years of the First Emperor are the subject of a landmark exhibition at the British Museum that opens next month. The exhibition will display 120 treasures from the Xian mausoleum site, including a dozen lifesize statues of warriors, as well as others of recently discovered acrobats, musicians and entertainers. The treasures arrived in London last week to be prepared for display in the museum&apos;s Reading Room. The loan of the figures - the largest number ever to have left Xian - has been discussed for several years. The final agreement was signed last July by Tony Blair in the Forbidden City on his trade mission to Beijing. The agreement had been brokered by Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum. Earlier this year, I went with a group led by MacGregor and the curator of the exhibition, Jane Portal, to visit the Xian site, where final decisions were being made about the exact figures to be dispatched. On the way there, I&apos;d wondered why such care was taken over which particular warriors might be sent. When I was first confronted by the pottery battalions at Xian, I quickly began to see the problem. Far from being a faceless identikit horde, each clay figure wears a unique expression. Though body parts were moulded and mass-produced to a number of different designs, the faces and finish of each warrior in the vast silent army are entirely singular. There are differences in age and rank; some smile, some look careworn; there are grimaces of concentration, looks of arrogance. The original figures were painted in bright blues and reds, but that colour has gone and a dusty clay now reinforces the idea of the soldiers having emerged from the grave into the flat morning light of the covered hangar, standing in readiness in columns divided by the banks of earth from which they came. There are four pits, each traversed by walkways. One shows the area as it was discovered, the warriors still interred in earth tunnels; another, smaller pit seems to represent a nerve centre: special troops, high command and charioteers; in the main pit, some figures are as they were found in 1974, fragments of heads and armour; many more - about 1,000 - have been painstakingly jigsawed together and restored to their original form. The effect is magical. The detail of hair braids, belt buckles and shoe treads survives intact. Hollow lifesize horses display an anatomical correctness that would satisfy Stubbs. Other sectors of Qin society have also subsequently been unearthed - pottery bureaucrats and moulded musicians, as well as exquisitely tooled bronze chariots and wagons, redolent of an imperial life of opulence and lightness, a contrast to the massed martial might of the warriors. Neil MacGregor spends all his working days surrounded by glories of ancient worlds, but he could not hide his awe at the scale and ambition of this place. &apos;I assumed they would be legions of identical soldiers, but when you realise that they all were given individual characters and that together they make up a whole newly created nation, it becomes something extraordinarily different. No culture ever individuated ordinary people in this way. The Egyptians might have been at pains to give faces to the pharaohs but the mass of people were just that, a mass. &apos;In Britain, we do not begin to show difference in common people until well into the Middle Ages and yet here is a monument that has taken great pains to express individual identity in ordinary soldiers, each one representing a different region or ethnicity, 2,200 years ago. It challenges our notion of China, about our stereotypes of the country as a single body of people. Here is evidence from the very beginning of the culture that they were deeply interested in individuals.&apos; The pit of warriors is only the beginning of what might be at Xian. After leaving the museum, we drove a mile to a hill in the shape of a flattened pyramid that stands out from the surrounding scrub farmland. The great, grassy mound is the tomb of Qin Shihuang. You can walk to the top and begin to see the scale of the original necropolis. You can also begin to imagine what lies beneath the mound itself. According to Chinese historian Sima Qian, writing a century after Qin&apos;s death, the tomb of the First Emperor was created as an underground microcosm of China. The rivers and seas of the new empire were made in mercury and flowed beneath a representative heaven. The emperor was laid at the centre of this subterranean fantasy in a bronze coffin surrounded by unknown treasures. Standing on the hill, you cannot help feeling there is a very Chinese pace to the excavation of this place. In any other country, the temptation to dig here would be hard to resist. The Chinese have no such plans. For a start, this is a tomb and issues of desecration arise. More importantly, archaeologists here believe they don&apos;t have the expertise to guarantee they could preserve all that might be uncovered; until they do, the official line is that it will be safer to leave the tomb undisturbed. Given the rate of change in China, it will be instructive to see if this policy is sustained. Tourist dollars are already boosting the Chinese economy; the idea that they may have the most significant archaeological site in the world unexcavated may prove harder to resist. It would be like discovering Camelot and not being curious to find the Round Table. There is a serenity to the place, but one which it hardly deserves. The tomb was commissioned by the Qin emperor at the height of his autocratic power. He had dreams of immortality; in the last years of his life - he died at 50 - he sought elixirs and ingested large quantities of mercury that exaggerated his megalomania. According to Sima Qian, 700,000 men were press-ganged to construct this mausoleum - a profound attempt to take the empire to the grave - and many were apparently buried alive within its confines to preserve its secrets. Some of these secrets will be on display in London. Unlike previous exhibitions, which have tended to focus on the warriors themselves, the British Museum has set itself the challenge of understanding more about the extraordinary man behind the army. This is a fashionable line of inquiry among Chinese scholars. Most of what is known of Qin Shihuang comes from accounts of his brutality from the succeeding Han empire, which, 20 years after his death, swept his successor from office and rewrote the empire&apos;s early history. Since Qin had sought to purge the state of Confucian scholars, it is suggested they sought revenge in their accounts of him. Some of the more extreme instances of Qin&apos;s mania for power - infamous stories of his ordering a mountain to be deforested and painted red as an act of retribution against the mountain god, say - might be viewed as products of this posthumous anti-propaganda. What is certain is that after the empire had been established through the efforts of his brutal army, Qin achieved an extraordinary amount in his brief decade of imperial rule. He unified the Chinese writing system, established a standard legal code and common weights and measures and oversaw the creation of a bureaucracy based on examined merit. He also conscripted hundreds of thousands of men in the construction of the defence system that became the Great Wall. Historians now speculate that this monumental task was part of a symbolic effort to unite the new empire against a common enemy rather than any strategic military project: the barbarians from across the mountains - who never came - were widely depicted as monstrous, dragon-toothed warriors. From the beginning, the wall was perhaps not there to defend the Chinese from the outside world but to unite them against it. Qin Shihuang also pursued this goal by controlling information. He was, by all surviving accounts, among the most dedicated of book burners. The traditional role of scholars had been to measure the nation&apos;s rulers against Confucian ideals. Qin was an early believer in Year Zero. Libraries were torched and scholars apparently buried alive. Ever since, as a result of these recorded horrors, the First Emperor has mostly been seen as a figure of revulsion for the Chinese. It was Mao who began to revise this historical view. Not surprisingly, he saw in the reign of Qin the revolutionary portents of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. &apos;Qin Shihuang buried 460 scholars alive; we have buried 46,000 scholars alive,&apos; he once announced. &apos;You [intellectuals] revile us for being Qin Shihuangs. You are wrong. We have surpassed Qin Shihuang a hundredfold.&apos; In 1973, the year before the tomb was discovered at Xian, Mao wrote a poem in praise of China&apos;s original demagogue: Please don&apos;t slander Emperor Qin Shihuang, Sir/ For the burning of the books should be thought through again./ Our ancestral dragon, though dead, lives on in spirit,/ While Confucius, though renowned, was really no one./ The Qin order has survived from age to age...&apos; Though not celebrating him in such terms, this reappraisal of Qin&apos;s reputation has continued in the decades since Mao&apos;s death. China&apos;s new confident nationalism has prompted a surge of interest in the Qin empire. The nation&apos;s foremost composer Tan Dun premiered his opera The First Emperor at the Met in New York last year with Placido Domingo singing the role. The opera depicted the contradictions of a man who used his brutal centralised power for the common good. This theme was also picked up by Zhang Yimou, China&apos;s best-known director, whose films Raise the Red Lantern and To Live had been banned in his home country. Far from exciting the attentions of Beijing&apos;s censors, however, Hero, his biopic of the First Emperor, was submitted by the authorities as China&apos;s nominee for best foreign film at the Academy Awards. In Yimou&apos;s reading, Qin was a sophisticated and inspired leader driven to acts of terror by a realisation of the need to bring to China the stability necessary to create a great civilisation. This seems to have played well with the current forces of order. Yimou&apos;s most recent films promote China&apos;s hosting of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and the successful bid to stage the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai. It is widely believed in Beijing that these two events will mark the full emergence of the new China on the world stage. Such cultural exchanges as the one agreed with the British Museum are part of the soft diplomacy of this strategy. It is a two-way process. While we were in China, Neil MacGregor opened a reciprocal exhibition in the Forbidden City of objects loaned from the British Museum, exploring the intellectual origins of the British empire, entitled Britain Meets the World. The exhibition played well to the current Chinese obsession with &apos;benign&apos; expansion. While we were in China, there was much talk of a recent official television series called The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, a history of the world&apos;s great trading empires since the 15th century. The programme that had apparently fascinated the Chinese most was devoted to how the British achieved industrialisation, and how it shared - and imposed - its culture in the world. The series ended, pointedly, with the rise and fall of the United States, the unspoken conclusion being that the economic superpower in waiting was Chinese. MacGregor has been fascinated to see at close quarters the Chinese beginning to open up to the world. It had initially been hard, he suggested, even to describe the concept of the British Museum to the Chinese, its role as a storehouse of global memory. &apos;It is,&apos; he told me, &apos;an alien concept for the Chinese to have a museum that houses the whole world. Their museums only have Chinese objects in them. Their universities only study Chinese history. They want that to change.&apos; And very quickly by Chinese standards. Young curators, for example, have been sent to the British Museum to learn from its example. In readiness for its envisaged new role in the world, China is suddenly extremely anxious to assimilate and engage with cultures beyond Qin&apos;s wall. You could see the arrival of the wonderful warriors in London this autumn as an advanced raiding party of this desire. (The last time they were loaned out was to Taiwan, where, having failed so far at traditional diplomacy, it was claimed China was now practising &apos;terracotta diplomacy&apos;.) Whatever the motivation for their presence here, however, they come very much in a spirit of accord and they are a spectacle not to be missed.  Building the terracotta army 5th-3rd century BC China&apos;s ruling Zhou dynasty&apos;s power crumbles and the empire fragments. Seven major states emerge. 361-338 BC Qin statesman Shang Yang transforms Qin into the most dominant state. 247 BC  A 13-year-old Qin Shihuang takes the throne of Qin. He rules under a regent until 238 BC, when he assumes full power. 246 BC Construction of Qin Shihuang&apos;s mausoleum containing the Terracotta Army begins. 230-221 BC  Qin armies conquer each of the six other Chinese states. After his final victory, Qin Shihuang becomes the First Emperor. 210-202 BC  Qin Shihuang dies and is buried in his mausoleum. His son Qin Er Shi&apos;s grip over the empire quickly weakens, and the Han dynasty takes control. 1974  The terracotta army is unearthed near Xian by farmers.  \u00b7 The First Emperor: China&apos;s Terracotta Army, British Museum, London WC1, 13 Sep-6 Apr 2008.

The China Airlines plane exploded near the Naha airport terminal building in Okinawa, Japan.

Airport traffic controllers had received no report from the pilot that anything was wrong, he said. The 157 passengers - including two small children- evacuated the plane on inflated emergency slides. One member of the ground crew was injured, Kyodo news agency reported.

Police said terrorism was not suspected. Early investigations raised the possibility that leaking fuel may have caught fire. &quot;There is a possibility of the engine exploding and catching fire due to a fuel leak,&quot; a Naha airport police official told Reuters. The fire was put out about an hour later, leaving the aircraft charred and mangled. Several passengers interviewed by the broadcaster NHK said were they were preparing to get off the plane after what seemed like an ordinary landing when they were told to use the emergency slides to evacuate. Some said they saw smoke and flames entering the cabin and that they heard explosions minutes after they left the aeroplane. The head of Taiwan&apos;s Civil Aeronautics Administration, Chang Kuo-cheng, said China Airlines and its subsidiary Mandarin Airlines had been ordered to ground their 13 other Boeing 737-800s pending a full inspection. &quot;If there was a fire, it might have something to do with an oil leak,&quot; Mr Chang said, noting that the exact cause was not known. The Okinawa fire is a setback to China Airlines, which in recent years appeared to have improved on a troubled safety record among international carriers.

Then, as now, the argued that some people were not fit for freedom.&quot; In fact, it seems rather doubtful that any substantial body of opinion actually did argue this about Japan. Perhaps some people argued that it was more important to the United States that Japan be a reliable ally against the Soviet Union than that it be a democracy. Which, of course, is precisely what American policy was. As former Tokyo CIA station chief Horace Feldman is quoted in Tim Weiner&apos;s new book Legacy of Ashes &quot;We ran Japan during the occupation, and we ran it a different way in these years after the occupation,&quot; ensuring the Liberal Democratic Party a basic monopoly of political power in exchange for deference to American security policy in Asia. Despite this meddling, Japan did emerge from the post-war occupation with the basic scheme of a liberal democracy in place, which was all to the good. Elsewhere in Asia, however, things didn&apos;t work out so well, and countries like Taiwan, South Korea, and the Philippines were subjected to America-friendly military dictatorships that only became democratic decades later as a result of popular protest. One points this out not to condemn America&apos;s Asia policy of the 1940s and 1950s, but merely to observe that democracy-promotion wasn&apos;t especially high on the agenda. This serves, in turn, as a reminder that the United States hardly invaded Japan (or Germany or Italy for that matter) in order to build democracies. Rather, Japan launched a sneak attack on American soil, Germany invaded Poland, both were hell-bent on world domination, and the allies prosecuted World War II as a fundamentally defensive measure. The contrast with Iraq could not be more stark. Nor, indeed, could the contrast between homogenous, resource-poor Japan and heterogeneous, oil-rich Iraq be much greater. Indeed, though leading war advocate Paul Wolfowitz demonstrated gross ignorance of Iraq when he testified before congress that the country had no history of ethnic strife, he was showing a keen awareness of the fact that a history of ethnic strife would make the country an unpromising proving ground for gunpoint democratization. All this, however, was but the appetizer for a shocking embrace of a historically illiterate account of the Vietnam war. &quot;One unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America&apos;s withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens,&quot; Bush said &quot;whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like &apos;boat people,&apos; &apos;re-education camps&apos; and &apos;killing fields.&apos;&quot; While it is of course true that people died in South Vietnam following American withdrawal, millions died during the United States&apos; years of military involvement as well, a great many killed by the American military at enormous expense and with no end in sight. The killing fields of Pol Pot&apos;s Cambodia, meanwhile, were if anything more a consequence of America&apos;s destabilization of the region than of America&apos;s departure. Unenlightening as Bush&apos;s analogies may be, they do serve as an interesting sign of the times. For years, war-supporters derided any efforts to draw parallels between Iraq and Vietnam as unwarranted, now they&apos;re eager to draw them. The reason, most likely, is that while the hawks lost the war in Vietnam and eventually even lost the debate over the war, they believe themselves to have eventually won the larger political battle as Ronald Reagan embraced Bush-style revisionist accounts of the war in southeast Asia as part of his march to the White House in 1980. For months now, many conservatives have been fundamentally positioning themselves for the post-war era, readying the arguments that will blame the failure of the venture in Iraq on its opponents rather than its architects. That Bush himself has chosen to join them is, perhaps, on some level the clearest reflection of the reality that the president knows perfectly well that the war is unwinnable, and blame-shifting now the best hope for saving his historical legacy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/aug/22/1", "publicationDate": "2007-08-22T22:57:45Z", "tags": ["Politics"], "sentences": ["At the recent British Open Women&apos;s golf tournament in St Andrews, Taiwanese players were listed as coming from &quot;Taiwan, province of China&quot;."], "title": "Duncan Campbell's diary", "article": "\u00b7 It&apos;s hard work being a comedian at the Edinburgh festival, with so many competing for attention and all their flyers promising the chance to see someone who is &quot;hilarious from start to finish&quot;, or indeed &quot;so hilarious I actually half-choked on my pint&quot;. So how do you get your money&apos;s worth? One way is to see only the comics who are part of the Free Festival and pay nothing, as opposed to \u00a337.50 for a Ricky Gervais ticket. Free admission means, of course, that some approach the show with scepticism, as John Gordillo, described as &quot;the same calibre [as Gervais] and he&apos;s free&quot;, has discovered. As he entered the auditorium of the Counting House, one punter said under his breath to his partner: &quot;Let&apos;s sit close to the door in case he&apos;s shite.&quot; (Interest declared: Gordillo is my nextdoor neighbour; I am a firm believer in the second commandment.) \u00b7 Audiences at the festival are not shy about expressing themselves, as Simon &quot;scintillating and hilarious&quot; Brodkin discovered on Monday night at the Pleasance. A couple walked out in the middle of his show, the man pausing by the door to say: &quot;I&apos;m going to the toilet - I need to be sick.&quot; Brodkin was in mid-persona as a football player, Jason Bent, who later remarked how often people compared the wages of nurses to those of footballers. &quot;Bent&quot; explained that he had recently been to see sick kiddies in hospital and ended up having a kick-about in the car park with the nurses. &quot;Now I understand why they&apos;re paid so little,&quot; he remarked. &quot;They&apos;re rubbish.&quot; \u00b7 We are all quite rightly encouraged to recycle our electrical equipment rather than have it dumped in the ground as landfill. But it seems that recyclers had not foreseen one problem: how do you get people who have no further use for vibrators and sex toys to present the items at recycling dumps without embarrassment? One firm, LoveHoney, has seen a gap in the market and is offering an amnesty: old vibrators can be sent back to them and they will then donate \u00a31 &quot;to a green charity&quot; as well as offering a new model at half price. Who said romance was dead? \u00b7 Scots, as everyone knows, invented golf (along with penicillin, the phone, steam engine, television, the romantic novel, anaesthetics, the Mackintosh raincoat - both clean and dirty versions - radar, calculus, marmalade, moral philosophy and modesty) but sometimes the game&apos;s officials may feel they are still in the glorious era of the Scottish renaissance. At the recent British Open Women&apos;s golf tournament in St Andrews, Taiwanese players were listed as coming from &quot;Taiwan, province of China&quot;. After protests from the embassy, the record has been changed. Or has the Chinese government tipped off the St Andrews officials about something that has slipped under the radar (see above) of the rest of the world? \u00b7 Bikers have come under scrutiny as the result of the murder last week of a Hell&apos;s Angel, so it&apos;s reassuring to see in Auto Trader (part of the Guardian family, indeed a beloved, generous uncle) that there is a soft-hearted side to them as well. An ad from a biker in Fairways, Johannesburg, tells its own story: &quot;This bike is perfect. Only done 7,000 kms. No faults, scratches. I use it as a cruiser/commuter. I&apos;m selling it because it was purchased without the proper consent of a loving wife. Apparently &apos;Do what the fuck you want&apos; doesn&apos;t mean what I thought.&quot; \u00b7 Newspapers are always generous about the achievements of their rivals. The only reason none of us ever mentions that a journalist from another paper has won an award is lack of space. In cinemas this week is the Bourne Ultimatum, which features Paddy Considine as a Guardian journalist exposing international corruption - just another day at the office, really. His role is a key part of the film, and one would have thought other papers would celebrate this. Alas no. My colleague Isabelle Chevallot has found that, although the Independent on Sunday and Sunday Times mention our key role, the Sunday Express includes an unflattering reference, the FT is ambiguous and most others ignore this crucial part of the plot. Envy is such an unbecoming emotion.  diary@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/23/sobushhasfinallyused", "publicationDate": "2007-08-23T16:00:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "Iraq", "George Bush", "Middle East and North Africa", "US politics"], "sentences": ["The US had stopped the communists in Korea and in Taiwan, and it felt it had to stop them in south-east Asia."], "title": "This is a war for credibility", "article": "So, Bush has finally used the V-word. He has drawn the parallel he has in the past refused to draw between Iraq and Vietnam. His avoidance of it had two obvious causes, personal and political: a bystander in the first war and the instigator of the second, he did not want to remind Americans that he was a man who sent others to fight but had never fought himself. And he has not wanted, until now, to suggest that the US faces a disaster in Iraq as big as that represented by defeat in Vietnam. Why has he invoked Vietnam in this way? Desperation is one answer. Bush paints the spectacle of national humiliation, tragic results for allies and friends, and the emboldening of America&apos;s enemies in order to strengthen his weak hold on the allegiance and attention of the American people. Alibi is another: if the war is to be lost, he wants to be on the record that he warned of the consequences if defeatists had their way. That way, Republicans could return to power at some future point claiming that the decline in American influence in the world, to which Iraq will almost certainly lead, came about because Democrats ran out on the war. Belief is a third answer. The political school to which Bush and his key advisers on Iraq belong believe the Vietnam war was lost because America did not persevere, not because the war was unwinnable. The rift between them and those in their generation who came to see the Vietnam war as a terrible mistake or even as an act of imperialist folly has persisted through the years. This is the longstanding argument that shaped the minds of those who took the decision to invade Iraq. But what of the parallel itself? America truly did occupy South Vietnam in a way it never has occupied Iraq, bringing in more than three times as many troops as are in the latter country now. It helped raise and train local forces of some quality, certainly higher than that of the Iraqi army and police now. It faced a strongly organised and centralised enemy equipped with advanced weapons and assisted by the two communist big powers, not the multiple and rivalrous insurgencies that characterise Iraq, with their relatively weak support from the outside. In Cambodia, too, there was only one opponent. As to the outcome of defeat for local people, Khmer Rouge barbarities bear comparison with those of the jihadists, but Vietnamese postwar actions, although often cruel and unnecessary, do not. There are great differences but one essential similarity: America went to war in Vietnam and Iraq to preserve its credibility and to restore a dominance that events had challenged. In 1965, US air power had failed to halt the North Vietnamese drive to unite the country under communist authority. The US had stopped the communists in Korea and in Taiwan, and it felt it had to stop them in south-east Asia. The bombs had not worked, so the boots on the ground followed. In 2003, the US went to war in Iraq to show that after 9/11 it was still the world&apos;s greatest power, that it could prevail and that enemies and friends alike should take note. As it turned out, defeat in south-east Asia did not seriously damage American prestige and did not lead to further communist advances; Bush is quite right to say, or to imply, that defeat in Iraq could have far worse consequences. Can some of those consequences still be avoided, or limited? That is the debate in which America ought to be engaged now, but Bush is not the man to lead it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/24/guardianobituaries.obituaries1", "publicationDate": "2007-08-23T23:09:21Z", "tags": ["Music"], "sentences": ["However, his largest recording output was with Bennett, for the Japanese Camerata Tokyo label, and the flautist&apos;s own label, Beep Records, which include live concerts from Japan, Taiwan, Vienna and the Wigmore Hall, London."], "title": "Obituary: Clifford Benson", "article": "The pianist Clifford Benson, who has died aged 60 from a brain tumour, was delightfully easygoing. His relaxed and kindly approach to his work as an accompanist and chamber musician put everyone at their ease. His humility, perceptiveness and skill made him greatly valued by the fortunate few with whom he performed, though as his career developed, he became selective, refusing offers from eminent performers whom he felt lacked empathy. This combination of factors resulted in rather less international recognition than he might have received otherwise. His distinctive approach to coaching grew out of the international summer school held in Canterbury for six years from 1969, and then in Ramsgate for another 12. Clifford started by accompanying the celebrated French flautist Marcel Moyse in the first two years, and then went on to work with all the woodwind classes. In the process, he developed his own distinctive formula, the sonata class, a method of enlightening the player of the melody instrument in a duo from the perspective of the piano. From 2000 onwards, he directed his own summer camp at Frensham Heights, Surrey, coaching duos of various instruments. He brought the same enthusiasm to all levels of performer, his classes punctuated with anecdotes and humour. Clifford was born in Grays, Essex. His father was a local government official and amateur violinist. Clifford studied the piano with Rhuna Martin, first wife of the flautist William Bennett, and later attended the junior department of the Royal College of Music, London, where he met the violinist Levon Chilingirian. Bennett and Chilingirian later became his most important duo partners. Entry to the senior organisation followed. Clifford continued his studies at the RCM with Lamar Crowson and Cyril Smith, winning the Chopin prize and the Martin music fund scholarship, awarded by the New Philharmonia Orchestra, which enabled him to further his studies. His career was launched when his duo partnership with Chilingirian won the BBC Beethoven duo competition in 1969, and an international competition in Munich in 1971. As a result, they were offered BBC broadcasts, and London concerts at the South Bank and Purcell Room followed. With the Nash Ensemble, he worked with singers such as Cleo Laine, Marion Montgomery, Sarah Walker and Eartha Kitt; the composer John Tavener; and recorded Schubert&apos;s Trout Quintet and septets by Hummel and Berwald. In 1979 he played the piano reduction of the Elgar cello concerto for Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9&apos;s TV masterclasses on BBC2. Also for the BBC, Clifford was a member of the judging panel for the Young Musician of the Year competition, and he adjudicated at many festivals and at all the leading British colleges of music. Notable among his recordings are those with Dame Thea King (obituary, July 2 2007) of clarinet music by Brahms and British composers; songs by a variety of composers with tenors Ian Partridge and Martyn Hill, baritone Stephen Roberts, and bass Michael George; and his double-album recording of songs by Charles Stanford with baritone Stephen Varcoe. On DVD, as in concert, I was lucky enough to be joined by Clifford in variations by a mixture of composers on the Carnival of Venice - 48 of them, presented on 58 flutes and piano, his swiftness in moving from one style to another matching mine in changing instruments. However, his largest recording output was with Bennett, for the Japanese Camerata Tokyo label, and the flautist&apos;s own label, Beep Records, which include live concerts from Japan, Taiwan, Vienna and the Wigmore Hall, London. These releases ensured that little worthwhile 19th and 20th century repertoire remains unrecorded. Clifford&apos;s discs with Chilingirian included the Schubert Sonatinas, followed in 1976 by the first recording of the Frank Bridge Sonata. With violinist Lydia Mordkovitch, he recorded sonatas by Nielsen, Prokofiev, Shostakovich and Schnittke; and with Shlomo Mintz, encore pieces by Fritz Kreisler. Clifford also joined the Alberni quartet in the Shostakovich piano quintet. As a soloist, he managed to fit in occasional recitals in Japan and the US, and he was an annual feature at the Portsmouth festival. Last year, he performed a programme celebrating Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Clifford joined the staff of the Royal Academy of Music, London, in June 1993, teaching accompaniment, and his chamber music workshops were very popular. Shortly before his death, he was present for the recording by his friend Michael Dussek of several piano pieces of his own, composed in a charming, witty and approachable style. His mother Doris, sister Sylvia, wife Dilys and their daughters Sarah and Emily survive him. \u00b7 Clifford George Benson, pianist, born November 17 1946; died August 10 2007"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/27/theenergiesofpoorwomen", "publicationDate": "2007-08-27T09:00:43Z", "tags": ["Gender", "Immigration and asylum"], "sentences": ["In Taiwan recently, there was a scare that female Filipino servants were systematically seducing male members of the household in order to extort money from them."], "title": "The hired hands that rock the cradle", "article": "All over the world, the energies of poor women are diverted from the care of their own families to that of the children of the rich. Money-power compels women into the service of people of privilege, not only within neighbourhoods but also within countries. And of the 100 million global female migrants, most work as servants. No one knows how many women domestic servants there are. In a world in which statistics for almost everything are freely available, there is an absence of information about who and how many women work in the service of others. The data are incomplete. There are gaps in our knowledge. More research is needed. This is perhaps fitting for work that is invisible in the great drama of globalisation: disembodied hands that bring and fetch, tend and serve; ears that listen for the child&apos;s cry and the sound of the intruder in the house; eyes watchful for the falling infant, the cobweb on the ceiling, the dust on the floor. This work is essentially a &quot;private&quot; contract in what is referred to as the &quot;informal sector&quot;, as though it were scarcely work at all but a casual occupation carried out in the pleasant interstices of real life. What is known is that last year, according the International Labour Organisation, agriculture ceased to be the main employer of the world&apos;s 1.2 billion working women. It has been overtaken by the service sector, of which domestic service has the largest share. Domestic service is also the biggest single category of child labour in the world. These children, sometimes as young as seven or eight, may be met in the apartments of the middle-class: barefoot, self-effacing, noiselessly serving coffee to visitors in luxury apartments late at night; washing the vessels when the family have finished eating; sleeping on verandahs and landings and in attics; tiny, exploited captives in the villas of Dhaka, Jakarta and Mexico city. When I expressed astonishment to the family of a lawyer in Dhaka that they employed a child, the response was: &quot;Oh, but we have rescued her from the slums.&quot; Agencies and charities sometimes try to guess how many women work in this way. There are 280,000 migrant women workers in Kuwait; 10 million children in the world are &quot;household serfs&quot;. Jakarta has 700,000, Dhaka 300,000 servants. Sometimes they are unnamed, known only as &quot;girl&quot; or &quot;boy&quot; (the same depersonalisation that made employers in Britain rob servants of their name, and call them a generic Mary or Rose). In India alone, they are thought to number well over 10 million. One useful comparison is the Britain of a century ago. In 1900, there were about 1.75 million domestic servants, the vast majority women. This represented at least 5% of the female population over 14. If anything approaching this number is current in the developing world today, it would provide a figure into the scores of millions. Servants also serve as scapegoats for the guilt of their employers. The servant problem has become as hot a topic for debate in households of privilege as the success of children or the price of onions. Refrigerator doors are padlocked against them. They are made to sleep outside. They cannot be trusted. In Taiwan recently, there was a scare that female Filipino servants were systematically seducing male members of the household in order to extort money from them. Ghoulish tales of servants who rob and kill their mistresses confirm the danger in admitting these venal, opportunistic women into the sanctity of the home; so that setting them to work is seen as a noble endeavour - a favour to them and a risk to the security of the employers. More often, the opposite is true: the young woman, seduced by the father (or son) of the house, is a more characteristic figure, sometimes with the connivance of wives who don&apos;t mind if their husband&apos;s infidelity is contained under the conjugal roof and does not stray outside. Who know how many cases there are like that of Sonu? Last year, this 10-year-old servant in Mumbai was caught trying out lipstick at her mistress&apos;s dressing table. She was tortured and left to bleed to death, then hanged from the ceiling fan and reported to the police as a case of suicide. Remittances from workers abroad amount to more than $150bn (\u00a375m) annually, a large proportion of it from domestic workers. The Philippines receives about $14bn from overseas, far exceeding foreign direct investment or foreign aid. Remittances last year to Bangladesh reached $5bn. Does all this mean that the children of the poor require less attention than the children of wealth? It implies that for the well to do, the raising of a new generation is less important than other economic functions, which summon women into the boardroom, the academy and the media. Does this suggest that &quot;childcare&quot; for the offspring of privilege has been outsourced to poor women who have no &quot;qualifications&quot; other than that acquired in their love for their own children? Is it credible that poor women have &quot;natural&quot; instincts to tend children, instincts their busy and preoccupied sisters of wealth have forfeited? Many women who travel abroad, as nannies, childminders and housekeepers, live in reasonable comfort - if sometimes in appalling isolation - with families whose children they care for in the Gulf, Europe and North America. They send back to their own children money, gifts and promises: the Barbie doll and the Disney character, the electronic gadget and computer game, the better tomorrow and the longed-for return. But the most powerful influence upon the lives of children is not these tokens of distant affection but the absence of those they love. It is difficult to count the cost of the lack of consolation, affection and living flesh and blood in the lives of children. Societies where childcare has become an industrial input have, perhaps, become desensitised to this devolution of duty; but women in exile who sleep brief hours in cramped chambers in alien places with only their children&apos;s photographs for comfort experience this vacancy of the heart only as pain and loss. But you don&apos;t have to migrate to abandon your children. The mother who leaves her daughters - 10 and eight - alone all day while she works to provide the money for food; the woman who takes her pubescent daughter with her to her place of work, to protect her from predators in the slum where they live; the servant working in six houses in the Delhi suburbs; the child sold to a prospective employer because this represents one mouth less to feed: no wonder no reliable statistics exist, for they might permit a price to be placed on the psychological, social and moral costs the servants of globalism bear. Children suffer from these unsought desertions, and women are caught in a terrible bind: as a consequence of their desire to provide, the most loving of hands inflict appalling, incalculable damage."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/aug/27/taiwansacerif", "publicationDate": "2007-08-27T16:37:13Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Computing", "Technology", "Acer"], "sentences": ["It&apos;s tough being one of America&apos;s top 5 PC manufacturers, and another one may be about to disappear if Taiwan&apos;s Acer buys Gateway."], "title": "Taiwan's Acer is buying Gateway", "article": "It&apos;s tough being one of America&apos;s top 5 PC manufacturers, and another one may be about to disappear if Taiwan&apos;s Acer buys Gateway.

That is: Compaq (taken over by Hewlett-Packard), IBM (the PC division was taken over by Lenovo), Packard Bell (taken over by NEC), eMachines (taken over by Gateway), and Gateway (taken over by Acer). The survivors are HP and Dell, and Dell is having a rocky time of it. I&apos;ll be somewhat sorry to see Gateway go. It made good PCs at good prices, and after it set up in the UK, I bought three of its desktops in a row. However, Gateway withdrew from the UK market, and the company I used to know stopped existing a long time ago.

It also emerged yesterday that many other members of the Kenyan establishment are suspected of corruption involving a total of more than \u00a31bn. In a sharply worded response to the report on the Kroll inquiry into theft by the Moi regime, the Foreign Office - also speaking for the Treasury - said it was &quot;very surprised&quot; to read the claim by Alfred Mutua, the Nairobi government&apos;s spokesman, that the British government had been asked for help - but &quot;so far they have refused&quot;. The Foreign Office said: &quot;That is incorrect. We stand ready to assist Kenya with any asset recovery, as we have done successfully with Nigeria. But the Kenyans have not requested assistance despite our offer. Nor have they provided the information we would need to comply with any such request. Last year, when Lord Goldsmith [then attorney general] was in Kenya with Kenya&apos;s assistant minister of foreign affairs, Danson Mungatana, they confirmed publicly that we had offered this assistance.&quot; British officials in Kenya have also been in contact with the government of Mwai Kibaki to &quot;clarify&quot; the accusation that Britain had refused to help. Britain has led donor countries in calling for the prosecution of corrupt politicians, and Sir Edward Clay, the previous high commissioner in Nairobi, famously accused the government of &quot;vomiting on the shoes&quot; of donor countries by failing to stem corruption. Although the leaked report focuses on Daniel arap Moi&apos;s sons and two close allies, it also mentions several sitting MPs, including at least one current cabinet minister, as well as officials close to President Kibaki. Kroll is also understood to have investigated about 17 other people with ties to the former president, but these reports have yet to be made public. It also emerged yesterday that in 2004, Kenyan anti-corruption officials were near to freezing an offshore account with $300m (about \u00a3149m) of looted money in it but were thwarted when the cash was moved after a tip-off from within Kenya. The document lists properties in Britain, including a luxury flat in Lowndes Square in Knightsbridge and houses in Surrey supposedly purchased by the Mois or their associates. The Kenyan government has begun a damage limitation operation over the publication of the 110-page dossier on corruption compiled by the international risk consultant Kroll in 2004 but never published until the website Wikileaks released it this week. &quot;There is enough information now to blow not just the Mois but most of the Kenyan establishment out of the water,&quot; Sir Edward said last night. &quot;The scale and type of the money-laundering is what we were given to understand existed during the time I was in Kenya.&quot; As to who leaked the document, Sir Edward said: &quot;The motives for leaking this are probably complex but I suppose have something to do with reminding Mr Moi that his support for the president is quite important because here is the reminder that they have the dirt on him.&quot; At a glance Modelled on the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia in design and spirit, Wikileaks - the website which obtained the Kroll report - was established to facilitate &quot;untraceable mass document leaking and analysis&quot;. According to the website, the primary interest is to expose oppressive regimes in Asia, the former Soviet bloc, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, as well as unethical behaviour by western corporations and governments. Whistleblowers post documents anonymously. Wikileaks&apos; founders, who include &quot;dissidents, journalists, mathematicians and start-up company technologists&quot; from the US, China, Taiwan, Europe, Australia and South Africa, say that advanced cryptographic technology ensures that the whistleblower&apos;s anonymity is protected. \u00b7 The following clarification was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 15 2007. The report above included a quote from Sir Edward Clay, the previous high commissioner in Nairobi. He was quoted as having accused the Kenyan government of &quot;vomiting on the shoes&quot; of donor countries.

For the rich tax avoiders and evaders, it&apos;s heads I win and tails you tax-burdened mugs lose. Because when the system looks in danger of collapsing, huge tranches of the taxes of the middle- and lower-income groups supply the bulk of the funds that are used to rescue the system.

Within days, the UN secretariat answered the request with an outright rejection. This is now the 15th year in a row that Taiwan has been denied participation in this august global body, an organisation that has pledged to be &quot;open to all ... peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained&quot; in the UN charter. For many peoples and nations around the world, Taiwan has been an active and willing diplomatic and trading partner. It is the world&apos;s 18th-largest economy and the European Union&apos;s 10th-largest trading partner, and is well known as a vibrant and liberal democracy. In a rational world it would no doubt be a valuable and indispensable member of this international society. Yet the reality is that it has long been blocked from the UN. This year Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, took it upon himself to determine that Taiwan&apos;s letter of application &quot;could not be received&quot;, despite the fact that it was not his decision to make. The United Nations charter and rules grant only the security council and the general assembly the authority to decide on the admission of new members. By returning Taiwan&apos;s application letter as he did, the secretary general plainly overstepped the boundaries of his power. The secretary general defended his decision by citing UN general assembly resolution 2758; he said that this resolution asserts that Taiwan is a part of the People&apos;s Republic of China. However, this interpretation is not only improper, but false and dangerous. It is improper because resolution 2758 does not mention anything about Taiwan - the word &quot;Taiwan&quot; simply does not appear - let alone Taiwan&apos;s representation in the UN or the statement that &quot;Taiwan is a part of China&quot;. The fact is that Ban Ki-moon is not empowered to exercise this kind of discretion to review or screen UN membership applications based on his own interpretation. His interpretation is false because it ignores and contradicts the widely recognised fact that Taiwan is a free and independent country that has never been under the rule of the People&apos;s Republic of China. And his interpretation is dangerous because it provides China with a convenient rationale to arbitrarily alter the status quo of Taiwan without the consent of the Taiwanese people. It is a shared aspiration of the vast majority of the 23 million people of Taiwan to join the United Nations. A recent poll showed that 77% of the Taiwanese people support Taiwan&apos;s bid to join the body. They are eager to break away from the international isolation that has been imposed on them for decades. The UN secretary general&apos;s &quot;decision&quot; on Taiwan&apos;s application is tantamount to placing an international political apartheid on this beautiful island nation. It is an insult to a people who have been committed to advancing the course of democracy and striving for a dignified way of living. There is absolutely no defensible justification for continuing to deny the Taiwanese people the right to participate in and make a valuable contribution to the global community. As such, the United Nations should grant due respect to the will of the Taiwanese people by processing Taiwan&apos;s application in accordance with relevant rules and process. We urge the UN to pull down the wall of political apartheid against Taiwan.

From a satellite-killing missile test in January to reports of spyware in German government computers last month, there are growing concerns that China is being increasingly sophisticated and ambitious in its use of technology to secure information and disrupt communications. For more than a decade the Chinese military has been aware of the potential of information warfare. Army journals and generals&apos; speeches have emphasised the importance of securing &quot;electromagnetic dominance&quot; in the early stages of any conflict. Although the US military is dominant in terms of firepower, the Pentagon&apos;s reliance on satellites and computers is seen as a source of vulnerability. The US department of defence says China has an established information warfare unit. Its scale is unknown, but Beijing has been boosting military spending for 20 years and switching the army&apos;s focus from conventional arms to high technology. This year it declared military spending rose 17.8% to $45bn, but US analysts believe the real sum is much higher if the cost of the space programme and secret projects are added. Beijing&apos;s offensive capability in cyberspace and outer space were apparent on January 11, when its succeeded in blasting one of its own communications satellites into smithereens 500 miles above the earth. This test heightened fears of the &quot;China threat&quot;, particularly in the US, which sees this fast rising Asian economy as the country most likely to challenge its global dominance. The technological prowess of China is growing along with internet penetration, which will reach 150 million of its people this year and is on course to overtake the US within five years. Chinese censors use some of the world&apos;s most sophisticated internet filters. The so-called Great Firewall of China restricts information about the Dalai Lama, Taiwan, Falun Gong and other politically sensitive topics. Experts have offered to share this technology with other repressive states, including Zimbabwe. While China is almost certainly among the many countries developing systems of cyber attack, it denies making any use of them in the latest case. &quot;The Chinese government has consistently opposed and vigorously attacked according to the law all internet-wrecking crimes, including hacking,&quot; a foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters. She said the accusations were an example of &quot;cold war&quot; thinking. In Taiwan, the main target of the Chinese military, there have also been repeated attempts by mainland hackers to enter government networks.  China-based hackers have also been blamed for attempted attacks on offices in the Houses of Parliament in Britain and for leaving offensive messages and patriotic slogans written in Mandarin on websites in Japan."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/sep/06/internationalnews", "publicationDate": "2007-09-06T14:48:06Z", "tags": ["Business", "World news"], "sentences": ["Mr Hu also asked the US leader for help in curbing any Taiwanese moves towards independence, saying the next two years were a &quot;highly dangerous period&quot;, according to a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman.", "Taiwan has enjoyed de facto independence since separating from China in 1949 when nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by the communists.", "Beijing, however, has repeatedly threatened a military response if Taiwan formally declares independence.", "The US is involved as Taiwan&apos;s main protector and weapons supplier."], "title": "Bush and Hu in rare face-to-face talks", "article": "The US president, George Bush, and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, had a rare face-to-face meeting at a summit in Sydney today, discussing sources of mutual tension including scares over Chinese products, trade imbalances and political freedoms. &quot;He&apos;s an easy man to talk to,&quot; Mr Bush said after the 90-minute meeting on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit. &quot;I&apos;m very comfortable in my discussions with President Hu.&quot; Mr Hu called the talks &quot;candid and friendly&quot; despite their focus on issues of great sensitivity to Beijing, including recent alerts over tainted food and poisonous toys made in China. Yesterday, the US firm Mattel announced its third major recall of Chinese-made goods in a month, calling back 750,000 toys over concerns they used paint containing too much lead. Similar scares have hit some Chinese food exports, while in May reports about tainted Chinese-made toothpaste caused serious concern in the US. The Chinese president &quot;was quite articulate about product safety and I appreciated his comments&quot;, Mr Bush said after their talks, declining to say more. At a subsequent press conference with the Australian prime minister, John Howard, who was hosting the talks, Mr Hu said China was taking the issue seriously. Beijing was &quot;willing and ready to work together with the international community to step up cooperation in quality inspections and examinations&quot;, he said. The two leaders also discussed US concerns over the lack of religious and individual freedoms in China, Mr Bush said, adding that Mr Hu had invited him to attend the 2008 Olympics in Beijing and that he was &quot;anxious to accept&quot;. Mr Hu also asked the US leader for help in curbing any Taiwanese moves towards independence, saying the next two years were a &quot;highly dangerous period&quot;, according to a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman. Taiwan has enjoyed de facto independence since separating from China in 1949 when nationalist forces fled to the island following their defeat by the communists. Beijing, however, has repeatedly threatened a military response if Taiwan formally declares independence. The US is involved as Taiwan&apos;s main protector and weapons supplier. While relations between Washington and Beijing are officially cordial, there are other areas of contention, notably America&apos;s worries about its massive balance of trade deficit with China. Earlier this week there were also reports that Chinese hackers, some of them linked to the military, had gained access to Pentagon computers. Ahead of his meeting with Mr Hu, the US president said he planned to raise trade issues, particularly Washington&apos;s keenness for China to float its currency, the yuan, something Mr Bush said would be &quot;helpful in terms of adjusting trade balances&quot;. The Chinese currency, which is pegged at a fixed rate to the dollar, is widely seen as being greatly underpriced despite two moves by Beijing to revalue it since 2005. American manufacturers complain bitterly that this makes Chinese imports unfairly cheap and US products in China more expensive. Mr Bush and Mr Hu are the central figures at the Apec summit, an annual event for the 21-member grouping of nations from the Asia-Pacific and Americas. Both have also been the focus of protests by local demonstrators, not that either leader would have seen the marches except on television. Today, several hundred people marched through Sydney to protest at China&apos;s poor human rights record. Like other demonstrators, they were kept some distance from the Apec summit site, which is sealed off from the rest of the city by a three-mile security barrier nearly three metres high, nicknamed the &quot;rabble-proof fence&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/07/comment.china", "publicationDate": "2007-09-06T23:17:01Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["James Huang impugned the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, for his rejection of &quot;president&quot; Chen Shui-bian&apos;s application for Taiwan to be admitted to the United Nations ( Insulting and dangerous, September 3).", "By accusing Ban Ki-moon of overstepping the boundaries of his power, Huang - Taiwan&apos;s so-called minister of foreign affairs - forgot an obvious fact: the UN gave its verdict on the issue of Taiwan decades ago, and the secretary general was simply performing his duty.", "Huang alleged that &quot;Taiwan is a free and independent country&quot;.", "Taiwan has never been an independent country.", "Records of Chinese people developing Taiwan in earlier periods are found in many historical books and annals dating back more than 1,700 years.", "From the mid-12th century, the governments of different Chinese dynasties set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Taiwan.", "The social development of Taiwan continued according to Chinese cultural traditions even during its 50-year occupation by Japan after the war of 1894.", "In 1945, after victory against Japan, the Chinese government restored its administrative jurisdiction in Taiwan province.", "On the eve of the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949, the Kuomintang authorities headed by Chiang Kai-shek retreated from the mainland to Taiwan.", "The reunification of Taiwan with the mainland has been an internal affair for China ever since.", "This is not only recorded by the 1943 Cairo declaration, the 1945 Potsdam proclamation, and other international-community documents - which have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China&apos;s sovereignty over Taiwan under international law - but is also validated by the common practices of the UN and its members.", "That is why, as Huang complains, the general committees of successive sessions of the UN general assembly since 1993 have all refused to include the so-called issue of &quot;Taiwan&apos;s participation in the UN&quot; in their agendas, and why the 169 UN members that have established diplomatic relations with our country all recognise that Taiwan is part of China.", "Huang alleges that the decision &quot;is tantamount to placing an international political apartheid&quot; on Taiwan.", "Taiwan secessionists are attempting to sever the geographical, historical and cultural bond between Taiwan and the mainland, and are seeking de jure independence through UN admission."], "title": "Response: Taiwan is not, nor has it ever been, an independent country", "article": "James Huang impugned the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, for his rejection of &quot;president&quot; Chen Shui-bian&apos;s application for Taiwan to be admitted to the United Nations ( Insulting and dangerous, September 3). By accusing Ban Ki-moon of overstepping the boundaries of his power, Huang - Taiwan&apos;s so-called minister of foreign affairs - forgot an obvious fact: the UN gave its verdict on the issue of Taiwan decades ago, and the secretary general was simply performing his duty. In 1971 the UN decided &quot;to restore all [China&apos;s] rights to the People&apos;s Republic of China and to recognise the representatives of its government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek [Chen Shui-bian&apos;s predecessor] from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organisations related to it&quot;. This resolution, 2758, resolved the issue of China&apos;s legal representation in the UN once and for all. This is reinforced by the UN charter principle that only sovereign states are eligible to apply for the UN membership. Huang alleged that &quot;Taiwan is a free and independent country&quot;. Taiwan has never been an independent country. Records of Chinese people developing Taiwan in earlier periods are found in many historical books and annals dating back more than 1,700 years. From the mid-12th century, the governments of different Chinese dynasties set up administrative bodies to exercise jurisdiction over Taiwan. The social development of Taiwan continued according to Chinese cultural traditions even during its 50-year occupation by Japan after the war of 1894. In 1945, after victory against Japan, the Chinese government restored its administrative jurisdiction in Taiwan province. On the eve of the founding of the People&apos;s Republic of China in 1949, the Kuomintang authorities headed by Chiang Kai-shek retreated from the mainland to Taiwan. The reunification of Taiwan with the mainland has been an internal affair for China ever since. This is not only recorded by the 1943 Cairo declaration, the 1945 Potsdam proclamation, and other international-community documents - which have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China&apos;s sovereignty over Taiwan under international law - but is also validated by the common practices of the UN and its members. That is why, as Huang complains, the general committees of successive sessions of the UN general assembly since 1993 have all refused to include the so-called issue of &quot;Taiwan&apos;s participation in the UN&quot; in their agendas, and why the 169 UN members that have established diplomatic relations with our country all recognise that Taiwan is part of China. Ban Ki-moon was defending the principle of respecting sovereignty and integrity and non-interference in a country&apos;s internal affairs as stipulated in the UN&apos;s charter. Huang alleges that the decision &quot;is tantamount to placing an international political apartheid&quot; on Taiwan. This is a sensationalist description. Taiwan secessionists are attempting to sever the geographical, historical and cultural bond between Taiwan and the mainland, and are seeking de jure independence through UN admission.

He was the dominating political figure of the eastern Caribbean island for more than half a century - both before and after St Lucia&apos;s independence from Britain in 1979 - first as a member of the legislative assembly, then as chief minister, premier and, finally, prime minister. Compton was typical of a generation of Caribbean politicians whose careers were launched on the back of anti-colonial sentiment, but whose pragmatism made them essentially conservative leaders. During his career, in a trajectory familiar to small Caribbean islands, St Lucia changed from a neglected, semi-feudal backwater with a large, depressed peasantry into an independent state that saw tourism displace agriculture as the economic driving force. &quot;Daddy Compton&quot;, as he was known, was a small, energetic man, born on Canouan, a tiny, bone-dry island, part of St Vincent and the Grenadines, south of St Lucia, and the home of his mother. He arrived in St Lucia as a teenager and was brought up by his uncle, a master mariner and successful businessman from the east coast. The fact that Compton was not by birth a St Lucian was sometimes held against him, as was the fact that his parents were unmarried. He was educated at St Mary&apos;s Academy, the island&apos;s best school (a later pupil was Derek Walcott). Like many islanders in those days, he worked for a spell in the oil refineries of the Dutch island of Curacao. He then studied law at the London School of Economics, was called to the bar at Gray&apos;s Inn in 1951, and in the same year returned to St Lucia, where the process of self-determination was evolving with the introduction of universal suffrage. Compton set up in private practice but soon entered politics, becoming an independent member of the island legislative council in 1954. He represented Micoud-Dennery, a country district with ailing sugar estates, away from the urban centre of the capital, Castries. Two years later, he joined the island&apos;s first mass party, the St Lucia Labour party (SLP), becoming deputy leader (1957-61) under his mentor, the trade unionist George Charles. Compton made his first important intervention into anti-colonial politics in 1957 when the island&apos;s sugar factories, a major employer, refused its workers union recognition. The union launched a strike. Compton entered the dispute when, arriving at a factory, he was confronted by its owner with a gun. In response, Compton drew his own gun. As the crisis escalated, the British government, overreacting, sent a warship and police reinforcements from neighbouring islands. The strike ended with the workers getting a pay rise - and union recognition. Compton was charged with disturbing the peace, convicted and fined, but he emerged a hero. By the early 1960s, however, he had resigned from the SLP, frustrated by the old guard, and in 1964, formed the United Workers party (UWP): that same year the UWP won the island general election and Compton became chief minister, with more than 92% of the vote in his own Micoud-Praslin constituency. In 1969 and 1974, he triumphed again, and on independence, in February 1979, became prime minister. That July, however, despite the euphoria of independence, Compton was dethroned: in the face of a well-organised opposition, he lost the general election. He was accused of losing touch with the grassroots, and failing to deal with urban drift and growing unemployment. But he was back in power in 1982 - and remained there until 1996. Under his leadership, St Lucia began to develop. Bananas - the replacement for sugar that had faded out by 1961 - started their &quot;green gold&quot; years, in which thousands of small farmers benefited from the protected market in Europe. Agriculture in the central and east parts of this mountainous island, marble-halled hotels in the north and an (unsuccessful) attempt to generate foreign investment in a free-trade zone in the south were all part of Compton&apos;s plan. There were more jobs, even if they were unskilled. The infrastructure was improved and schools were built in rural areas. In 1992, in what he called his &quot;rendezvous with destiny&quot;, Compton won another election. The voters were unmoved by newspaper stories about his alleged relationship with a teenage girl, or by criticisms of a high-handed administrative style. More importantly, however, banana prices began to fall, and in 1993 disaffected banana farmers went on strike. Two farmers were killed in a confrontation with police. Compton, this time in opposition to the strikers, spoke of having to face an angry mob in the eastern Mabouya valley, &quot;an area which has benefited so much from my work and personal sacrifice&quot;. Himself a wealthy banana and coconut farmer, he was proud that he drove around the island in his &quot;humble pick-up&quot;. But during the strike, the truck was stoned. In foreign affairs, Compton had supported the 1983 US invasion of Grenada, and was less enthusiastic than many Caribbean leaders about relationships with Fidel Castro&apos;s Cuba. He was, however, an energetic proponent of regional integration projects, such as Caricom, the Caribbean&apos;s own, though underdeveloped, common market, and backed the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States and, unsuccessfully, a federation of the Windward Islands.

George Bush last week told an Australian interviewer : &quot;Why don&apos;t we all just wait and see what David Petraeus says.&quot; Mitt Romney, one of those who hopes to succeed him, told the last debate of the party&apos;s candidates: &quot;We haven&apos;t heard from General Petraeus [... ] I&apos;m going to hold out until we hear the report.&quot; That day has now arrived.  Gen Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, the US ambassador to Iraq, are to make the first of three appearances over the next two days before Congressional committees. Gen Petraeus is unlikely to recommend a significant reduction in US troops (the contrary of what polls suggest the majority of the US public supports) but the congressional hearings are likely to begin a period of intense debate on the US&apos;s future in Iraq. Follow the first hearing here, before the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees from 5.30pm BST. 5.33pm: The hearing begins on a disruptive note. Protesters at the back are removed with the words from Ike Skelton (D), chairman of the Armed Services committee, that &quot;No disturbances will be tolerated&quot;. 5.36pm Skelton begins the session proper with a statement that &quot;this Congress and the nation are divided on the pace on which the US should turn over to the Iraqis.&quot; He says the &quot;strategic context&quot; is Iraq is a war which may break the US military, before going on to recount the US&apos;s past operations in Iraq - from invasion, through Falluja to the surge.  5.40pm Skelton says Gen Petraeus is &quot;the right person three years too late and 250,000 troops too short.&quot; He says the Iraqi government has failed to use the breathing space the surge was supposed to provide, and failed to step up to the challenge despite impressive US gains in Anbar province. He questions whether a Shia-led government will give arms to Sunnis who it may fear will try to overthrow it.  5.45pm: Tom Lantos (D), chairman of the Foreign Affairs committee (and a Holocaust survivor), takes his turn in front of Gen Petreaus and Crocker &quot;sent here,&quot; he says, &quot;to restore credibility to a discredited policy&quot;. He continues: &quot;The administration has sent you here to day to convince the members of these two committees and this Congress that victory is at hand&quot;, adding &quot;With respect, I don&apos;t buy it&quot;.  5.55pm: Lantos wants a &quot;strong message&quot; sent to the Maliki government that in the absence of political progress, American military force will no longer continue to support it. &quot;It is their country and it is their turn [...] the free ride is over, American troops will not be party to their civil war.&quot; He wants troops out now, for, he says, the good of Iraq and the good of the US. 6pm: Duncan Hunter (R) puts forward the opposite position. He says he expects an independent assessment from Gen Petraeus and expresses bewilderment Congress would put US gains in Iraq in jeopardy. 6.05pm: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R) brings in the war on terror. She says radical Islamists see Iraq as a &quot;central front in the war on freedom&quot; and the enemies of the emerging Iraqi government are &quot;our enemies too&quot;. Neville Chamberlain and the 1938 Munich agreement with Nazi Germany is introduced as an example of appeasement. She then quotes al-Qaida&apos;s number two, Ayman al-Zalwahiri, setting out his four stages of jihad in Iraq. First is the withdrawal of US troops, which then builds into campaigns against the neighbouring Arab states and finally - stage four - against Israel. Her final reference point is Ronald Reagan in the cold wae as she concludes an argument against withdrawal. At the moment, the committee members have divided on party lines. The two Democrats want to see US troops withdraw, arguing the Iraqi government has not met its side of the surge bargain - to build a national political reconciliation while the 30,000 extra US troops build security. The Republicans argue there is progress, and to leave now would put the US national interest in jeopardy. 6.15pm: Gen Petraeus speaks. Or at least attempts to - there are problems with the microphone (as there were earlier with this page, apologies to readers if time appeared to stand still.) More soon ... 6.30pm: The general begins his report. He says the military objectives are largely being met, he also sets out his independence - in reaction to recent charges from Democrats he will deliver a White House report (the advocacy group MoveOn.org today took out a full page advert in the New York Times labelling him &quot;General Betray Us&quot;.) 6.33pm: Gen Petraeus says &quot;ethno-sectarian&quot; competition is a fact in Iraq. The question is whether it happens &quot;more or less violently&quot;. He produces a map and charts to show how and where US and Iraqi troops have made progress. He says security incidents have declined since mid-June, falling in eight of the last 12 weeks and at their lowest level since April 2006. &quot;Ethno-sectarian&quot; deaths are down 55% (80% in Baghdad) since the height of Sunni-Shia killing in December 2006. He blames continuing deaths on al-Qaida attempts to reignite the conflict. 6.40pm: A chart for suicide car and suicide belt attacks shows a decline in casualties, but the figures are still &quot;too high&quot;, says Petraeus. He claims &quot;substantial progress&quot; against al-Qaida. He then accuses Iran of wanting to use militia forces to create a Hizbullah-like units in support of its aims in Iraq. A protester from the back shouts &quot;That&apos;s a lie&quot;. She is ejected. 6.50pm: Gen Petraeus says security improvements and the (albeit) &quot;slow&quot; progress of Iraqi government forces mean the US will be able to withdraw some troops next year. He does not say how many.  6.54pm: Now he does - a brigade combat team out in December, four more in the first seven months of next year, plus a marine expeditionary unit and two marine battalions: 30,000 in total. He says this will restore the US presence to a pre-surge level of 15 brigades. Another chart - this time a vertical bar chart - shows a very literal step down as the extra troops deployed for the surge descend on the horizontal axis in the next ten months. (8.40pm update: You can see this slide - and more - in a Pentagon PDF. The vertical bars actually drop below the pre-surge level to five brigades - a third of the projected summer 2008 troop presence - but what it fails to state on the horizontal axis is when this might happen.) He concludes exactly 30 minutes after he began to speak. 7pm: The left of the blogosphere, the antiwar netroots, is having its say. A post on Daily Kos summarises Petraeus&apos;s report as &quot;We won! Therefore, our troops need to stay there forever.&quot; More protesters - from the antiwar group Code Pink - begin to shout as Petraeus finishes. They are also ejected (there are a few more wearing distinctive pink ribbons, so there could be more of this to come.) 7.05pm: Ryan Crocker takes his turn. He says there is no point at which the US will be able to claim victory, such a situation, he says, will only become apparent after the fact. He says it is necessary to realise Iraq is going through a revolutionary period - and making sense of where they are now is only possible by understanding where they have been. He recounts the genocidal campaigns, violence and intimidation of the Saddam era and his creation of a &quot;pervasive climate of fear&quot;. When Saddam was deposed, he says, there was no Nelson Mandela to lead the country to the future - such a figure would have been killed. 7.15pm: Crocker stresses Iraqi politics must be seen against the backdrop of a country that is and will remain for some time a &quot;traumatised society&quot;. He says we should not be dismayed Iraqis have not resolved difficult issues, such as sectarian power struggles, oil revenues and the degree of centralised government - arguing instead what should be considered is the willingness of the Iraqi leadership to confront the country&apos;s many problems. 7.20pm: At the provincial level, Crocker says al-Qaida&apos;s overplaying of its hand and Moqtada al-Sadr&apos;s order for his Mahdi army to stop attacks have allowed political progress. He says there are &quot;success stories&quot; in the political and economic development of the provinces. &quot;Over time we expect local authorities will change the attitude of Iraqis to their elected representatives and the national government,&quot; he tells the committee members. But he adds the Iraqi economy is performing &quot;significantly under potential&quot;, using as an example the two hours of electricty that Baghdad residents receive daily. 7.25pm: More on the protesters - the sharp-eared Real Clear Politics heard Skelton referring to them off-mic as &quot;those assholes&quot;. 7.30pm: Crocker in brief: the US&apos;s current course is hard but the alternatives are &quot;far worse&quot;; success cannot be guaranteed in Iraq but it is attainable. 7.35pm: Atlantic blogger (and Comment is free contributor) Matthew Yglesias picks up on Crocker&apos;s use of the phrase &quot;post-kinetic environments&quot; as he sets out where funds were been made available for reconstruction projects. &quot;In case you don&apos;t get that reference, a &apos;post-kinetic environment&apos; is, for example, a neighbourhood that&apos;s been levelled by American military action,&quot; Yglesias explains. 7.45pm: Lantos begins the questioning: should the US expand its diplomatic dialogue with Iran and Syria? Crocker says he has not seen the necessary earnestness on the Iranian side, only an interest in &quot;the appearance of discussions&quot;. He asks Gen Petraeus if other commanders share his focus on Iraq when the US may want to deploy elsewhere, such as Afghanistan. Gen Petraeus says Admiral Fallon, commander of US Central Command, shares his assessment. 7.55pm: Hunter asks what the Iraqi people think of the Iraqi army and how it is performing. Petraeus says it is viewed as less sectarian and more professional than the police (though some elements are sectarian) and while readiness is uneven, where it is fighting it is taking casualties. He tells Hunter the challenge is training officers who can lead the recruits. 8.30pm: There are reports Cindy Sheehan - who camped outside George Bush&apos;s Texas ranch in summer 2005 - is among the ejected, and now arrested, protesters. 8.45pm: Gen Petraeus&apos;s slide showing the gradual stepping down of US troops is so far having the most impact among bloggers. Kevin Drum considers it a work of art: &quot;It looks like some kind of timeline for withdrawal, but all it actually says is that [...] eventually - someday - we&apos;ll draw down to five brigades. Could be tomorrow, could be ten years from now, but hey - the slide shows troops levels going down, and that&apos;s the graphic that counts.&quot; 9pm:  Gary Ackerman (D) asks why no one has mentioned the &quot;international war on terrorism&quot; since the hearing began? &quot;If it is, how can we suggest we have a draw down? How can we draw down until we kill each and every one of them?&quot; His answer is because it is not part of the war on terror but a mission to end sectarian violence. He asks if this is worth anymore American lives. Gen Petraeus and Ackerman go back and forth on the nature of al-Qaida in Iraq.  9.15pm Gene Taylor (D) asks for a target date for Iraqi troops to takeover from the US military. Gen Petraeus says the dates are drawn up on an ongoing province-by-province basis. He says he can give this classified timetable to the committee. 9.20pm Eni Faleomavaega (D) asks if the US could deploy elsewhere if necessary, to Taiwan or between the Kurds and Turkey. Gen Petraeus says he is not the person to answer that but he believes the US military needs to be larger. 9.50pm: Here are the takes from some of main US media organisations. The Washington Post leads on Gen Petraeus telling the committees the Bush administration&apos;s military objectives in Iraq &quot;are in large measure being met&quot;. The New York Times goes for &quot;Slow progress being made in Iraq&quot; as its headline, saying a reduction of troops to 130,000 is possible by mid 2008. The Los Angeles Times takes this for its headline: &quot;Petraeus says troop drawdown could begin next year&quot;. 10.30pm: Petraeus is asked if the committees can see the drafts he wrote in Baghdad, wihout &quot;edits from the White House and Pentagon&quot;. Gen Petraeus insists what he is presenting today is the Petraeus Report, and that the draft he has seen of the benchmarks report to be published by the White House on September 15 does not make substantial changes. 10.35pm: Reuters has reaction from Baghdad. The Iraqi government says it is comfortable with the gradual reduction proposed by Gen Petraeus.  10.55pm: Robert Wexler (D) introduces a sobering note to an already sober hearing - seven US troops have died in Iraq since Gen Petraeus began his report. He then compares today&apos;s hearing to General Westmoreland&apos;s report of progress in Vietnam. He asks how many more names will be carved into the eventual war memorial to maintain the US&apos;s credibility. Gen Petraeus replies that he has not proposed an extension of the surge: he repeats the number brigades of brigades and marine units he expects to leave; and repeats his figures for the decline in &quot;ethno-sectarian&quot; violence since June.  On combat deaths, he tells Wexler: &quot;If I did not think that was a hugely important endeavour [...] I would not testify as I did today.&quot; 11.15pm: The questions and answers are now coming to a close. Recurrent themes are Iran and sectarian split in Iraq. Crocker stresses Iraq is still a mixed country in provinces such as Baghdad and Dilaya. 11.25pm: Gen Petraeus is asked about a 2004 Washington Post editorial. He is asked why he should be believed now when he wrote three years ago he saw &quot;tangible progress&quot; in Iraq. He replies that the sectarian conflict that flared since then set back gains among the Iraqi security forces and emerging leadership. He says he is now neither an optimist or a pessimist: &quot;I&apos;m a realist. We&apos;ve learned lessons the hard way,&quot; he says.  11.45pm: Skelton adjourns the hearing. Gen Petraeus and Crocker tomorrow go before Senate committees, and will face questioning from Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain. Day two of Gen Petraeus&apos;s evidence can be found here."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/12/contradictionsofaclientsta", "publicationDate": "2007-09-12T14:00:00Z", "tags": ["Japan", "China", "US news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["When we look at east Asia today, we readily identify Taiwan and North Korea as the two salient problems left over from the postwar and cold war eras, and both potential causes of regional disturbance and danger."], "title": "Contradictions of a client state", "article": "So the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has resigned after a &quot;string of damaging scandals&quot; for his government and a &quot;humiliating electoral defeat&quot; in the July elections, say the wires today. Both explanations are true but they don&apos;t go to the heart of Japan&apos;s predicament. The clue lies in the immediate issue which, according to Abe himself, has provoked his resignation: he is quitting &quot;to pave the way for ruling and opposition parties to work together to approve the extension of Tokyo&apos;s naval mission in support of the US-led operation in Afghanistan.&quot; Abe himself blamed scandals over some of his ministers&apos; remarks and over political funding and pension records for his defeat in the Upper House elections, where his Liberal Democratic party lost control for the first time. He promised that he would &quot;boldly examine&quot; the constitutional system in place ever since the end of the war, and deliver &quot;a fresh start on the creation of a beautiful and new country&quot;. But the key to his problem - which has essentially been Japan&apos;s problem for 50 years - is how to reconcile subordination of the Japanese state to the US with nationalist sentiment and pretensions.

The greater his efforts to meet American demands, the more he stresses the beauty and integrity of Japanese history and tradition and calls for a break with the American-inspired postwar system, and the more in turn that irritates the US. The contradictions of the postwar state are not new, but in the post-cold war context they surface in plain view like a giant iceberg.&quot;  The latest example of this is Abe&apos;s attempt to force Okinawa - where he was heavily defeated in the elections - to accept the building of a new military complex for US forces. McCormack&apos;s argument is set out fully in his new book Client State: Japan in the American Embrace (Verso), where he characterises Japan as the &quot;schizophrenic state&quot;. It is one shared by serious scholars of Japan&apos;s history such as Chalmers Johnson (Japan Policy Research Institute), Bruce Cumings (University of Chicago) and Glenn Hook (University of Sheffield). When we look at east Asia today, we readily identify Taiwan and North Korea as the two salient problems left over from the postwar and cold war eras, and both potential causes of regional disturbance and danger. China is often cast, in spite of its post-Mao transformation and economic dynamism, as a possible source of future instability. We have just as much reason to include Japan which still has to resolve the legacy of its past - a retarded political system, a dependent relationship and frustrated neo-nationalism."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/13/themalaysianmiracle", "publicationDate": "2007-09-13T06:00:00Z", "tags": ["Malaysia", "Communities", "Business", "Economics"], "sentences": ["In the global growth league tables, Malaysia is in the top tier, along with China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand."], "title": "The Malaysian miracle", "article": "August 31 marked the 50th anniversary of Malaysia&apos;s Merdeka: independence after more than 400 years of colonialism. Malaysia&apos;s peaceful, non-violent struggle may not have received the attention that Mahatma Gandhi&apos;s did in India, but what Malaysia has accomplished since then is impressive - and has much to teach the world, both about economics, and about how to construct a vibrant multiracial, multi-ethnic, multicultural society. The numbers themselves say a lot. At independence, Malaysia was one of the poorest countries in the world. Though reliable data are hard to come by, its GDP (in purchasing power parity terms) was comparable to that of Haiti, Honduras, and Egypt, and some 5% below that of Ghana. Today, Malaysia&apos;s income is 7.8 times that of Ghana, more than five times that of Honduras, and more than 2.5 times that of Egypt. In the global growth league tables, Malaysia is in the top tier, along with China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Thailand. Moreover, the benefits of the growth have been shared. Hard-core poverty is set to be eliminated by 2010, with the overall poverty rate falling to 2.8%. Malaysia has succeeded in markedly reducing the income divides that separated various ethnic groups, not by bringing the top down, but by bringing the bottom up. Part of the country&apos;s success in reducing poverty reflects strong job creation (pdf). While unemployment is a problem in most of the world, Malaysia has been importing labour. In the 50 years since independence, 7.24 million jobs have been created, an increase of 261%, which would be equivalent to the creation of 105 million jobs in the United States. There were many reasons not to have expected Malaysia to be a success. Just as Malaysia was gaining its independence, the Nobel prize winning economist Gunnar Myrdal wrote an influential book called Asian Drama, in which he predicted a bleak future for the region. Malaysia is rich in natural resources. But, with few exceptions, such countries are afflicted with the so-called &quot;natural resource curse&quot;: countries with an abundance of resources not only do not do as well as expected, but actually do worse than countries without such benefits. While natural resource wealth should make it easier to create a more equalitarian society, countries with more resources, on average, are marked by greater inequality. Moreover, Malaysia&apos;s multiracial, multicultural society made it more vulnerable to civil strife, which has occurred in many other resource-rich countries, as one group tried to seize the wealth for itself. In many cases, minorities work hard to garner the fruits of this wealth for themselves, at the expense of the majority - Bolivia, one of the many rich countries with poor people, comes to mind. At independence, Malaysia also faced a communist insurgency. The &quot;hearts and minds&quot; of those in the countryside had to be won, and that meant bringing economic benefits and minimising &quot;collateral&quot; damage to innocent civilians - an important lesson for the Bush administration in Iraq, if it would only listen to someone outside its closed circle. And Malaysia had a third strike against it: for all the talk of the &quot;white man&apos;s burden&quot;, the European powers did little to improve living standards in the countries they ruled. The dramatic decline in India&apos;s share of global GDP under Britain&apos;s rule, as Britain passed trade laws designed to benefit its textile producers at the expense of those in its colony, is the most visible example. The colonial powers&apos; divide-and-rule tactics enabled small populations in Europe to rule large numbers outside of Europe, pillaging natural resources while investing little in the physical, human capital, and social capital necessary for an economically successful, democratic self-governing society. It has taken many of the former colonies decades to overcome this legacy. How, then, does an economist account for Malaysia&apos;s success? Economically, Malaysia learned from its neighbours. Too many of the ex-colonies, rejecting their colonial heritage, turned to Russia and communism. Malaysia wisely took an alternative course, looking instead to the highly successful countries of east Asia. It invested in education and technology, pushed a high savings rate, enacted a strong and effective affirmative action programme, and adopted sound macroeconomic policies. Malaysia also recognised that success required an active role for government. It eschewed ideology, following or rejecting outsiders&apos; advice on a pragmatic basis. Most tellingly, during the financial crisis of 1997, it did not adopt IMF policies - and as a result had the shortest and shallowest downturn of any of the afflicted countries. When it re-emerged, it was not burdened with debt and bankrupt firms like so many of its neighbours. This success was, of course, not only a matter of economics: had Malaysia followed the policies recommended by the IMF, it would have torn apart the social fabric created over the preceding four decades. Malaysia&apos;s success thus should be studied both by those looking for economic prosperity and those seeking to understand how our world can live together, not just with toleration, but also with respect, sharing their common humanity and working together to achieve common goals.

But this has not stopped him from using history to justify his policies. In a recent speech to American war veterans in Kansas City, he defended his aim to &quot;stay the course&quot; in Iraq by pointing out the consequences of the American withdrawal from the war in Vietnam. He also mentioned the post-1945 occupation of Japan and the Korean war as success stories in America&apos;s efforts to bring freedom to Asia, and by extension, the world. Historians, Democrats, and other Bush critics were quick to denounce his speech, particularly his reference to Vietnam, as self-serving, dishonest, and inaccurate. Yet, for once, Bush actually hit upon a historical analogy that was true. Of course, the Vietnam war was different in almost every respect from the war in Iraq. Ho Chi Minh was not Saddam Hussein. In Vietnam, the US was not invading a country, but defending a corrupt authoritarian ally against an aggressive communist regime. But what Bush actually said was that the US withdrawal from Indochina was followed by a bloodbath in Cambodia, and brutal oppression in Vietnam. A withdrawal from Iraq, he implied, would result in similar bloodshed, or worse. That is almost certainly true. However, what Bush did not say is that neither the mass murders in southeast Asia, nor the potential mass murders in Iraq, would have occurred without the chaos caused by US intervention. But what about the Asian success stories, in Japan, Korea, and other places under American protection? Was Bush right to boast of America&apos;s role in giving these countries their freedom? As he put it to the Kansas City veterans: &quot;Will today&apos;s generation of Americans resist the allure of retreat, and will we do in the Middle East what the veterans in this room did in Asia?&quot; What exactly did the US do in Asia? The first few years of the occupation of Japan were indeed a remarkable success for democracy. Instead of helping Japanese of the old school restore an authoritarian system, General Douglas MacArthur&apos;s administration helped Japanese liberals restore and improve their prewar democratic institutions. Trade unions were given more clout. Women got the vote. Civil liberties were boosted. And the semi-divine Japanese emperor was brought down to earth. Much of the credit for this goes to the Japanese themselves and to the idealistic, left-leaning new dealers in Gen MacArthur&apos;s government who supported them. When China fell to Mao&apos;s communists, however, and North Korea got Chinese and Soviet backing for an invasion of the south, democratic idealism was stopped in its tracks. In Japan, former war criminals were released from prison, &quot;reds&quot; were purged, and rightwing governments, led by some of those same former war criminals got enthusiastic American backing. Democracy, instead of being nurtured, was distorted, with active American encouragement, to make sure the right stayed in power and the left was kept at bay. South Koreans certainly have much to thank the Americans for. Without UN intervention in the Korean war, led by the US, the south would have been taken over by Kim Il Sung, and their current freedom and prosperity would never have been possible. But South Korean democracy was not something the US gave to the Koreans, or even always encouraged. From the late 1940s to the late 1980s, the US played along with, and sometimes actively backed, anti-communist authoritarian rulers, who grabbed and consolidated their powers through violent coups and the suppression of dissent. The same was true in the Philippines, Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand, and, indeed, in the Middle East, where democracy is yet to take root. As long as the cold war lasted, US administrations consistently favoured military strongmen and civilian dictators in the name of fighting communism - anything to keep the left down, even the kind of left that would have been regarded as simply liberal in the democratic west. True, for most people, life under rightwing Asian strongmen was, on the whole, preferable to life under Mao, Pol Pot, Kim Il Sung, or even Ho Chi Minh. But to call the citizens under Park Chung Hee, Ferdinand Marcos, or General Suharto &quot;free&quot; is an abomination. The happy fact that Koreans, Filipinos, Thais and Taiwanese did eventually become free, or at least freer, is not so much to the credit of the US as it is to the people who fought for their freedoms themselves. It was only in the late 1980s, when the communist empire was crumbling, that US governments actively backed democratic politicians and demonstrators in Seoul, Taipei, or Manila. But the heroes of democracy were Asian, not American. Bush is right to claim that people in the Middle East would like to be as prosperous and free as the South Koreans, but his notion that the war in Iraq is simply a continuation of US policies in Asia could not be more mistaken. In Asia, as in the Middle East, US strategy was to prop up dictators against communism until their own people toppled them. In the Middle East today, it is reckless and radical: invading a country, wrecking its institutions and expecting that freedom will grow in the ensuing state of anarchy. To confuse these different enterprises and pretend that they are the same is not only wrong but dangerous, and deeply disappointing to those of us who still regard the US as a force for good.

China will no longer give giant pandas to foreign countries as a way of improving international relations, the domestic media has reported. Ending an ancient tradition, wildlife officials said the endangered animals would only be lent for breeding and biological research. But questions are likely to be raised about the financial motives behind a decision that looks likely to boost the lucrative business of renting out the animals to zoos for as much as $1m (\u00a3490,000) a year. Panda diplomacy dates back more than a thousand years. Tang dynasty records show that two of the bear-like beasts were presented to the Japanese court during the reign of the empress Wu Zetian (624 to 705). The practice reached its peak in the early 1970s, when Mao Zedong sent the furry black-and-white ambassadors across the globe on a diplomatic charm offensive. A breakthrough summit with Richard Nixon in 1972 was sealed with the gift of Hsing Hsing and Ling Ling. Two years later the British prime minister Edward Heath was rewarded for his friendship with the present of Chia Chia and Ching-Ching to London&apos;s zoo. These days the world&apos;s fastest growing major economy is more likely to seek international influence through trade, aid and investment. Conservationists are also concerned that pandas are too rare to be given away as diplomatic trophies. There are believed to be only 1,600 pandas in the wild, living in the nature reserves of Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. But the captive population has made a comeback in recent years, providing a ready supply for foreign zoos. Even so, according to ChinaNews, the age of the free panda friendship symbol is over. &quot;The Chinese government has stopped giving pandas as gifts abroad. We will only be conducting research with foreign countries,&quot; the website quoted Cao Qingyuan, a state forestry administration spokesman, as saying. But airlines have not seen their last panda passengers. Under an international research and breeding programme the forestry administration rents them out on 10-year leases. The charge to foreign zoos depends on a a number of factors, including visitor revenues. In the US and Japan the yearly fees are about $1m. Extra payments are made if the pandas give birth. This summer the mainland presented a pair of pandas to Hong Kong to mark the 10th anniversary of the handover from British rule. Two others have been offered to Taiwan, but, with cross-straits relations fractious, they have not yet left their birthplace in Wolong, Sichuan province. Mr Cao said the gifts to the two Chinese islands were a special case of &quot;sending pandas between brothers&quot;. Backstory President Richard Nixon&apos;s trip to China in 1972 ended 25 years of isolation between the US and the People&apos;s Republic and resulted in the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979. As a result, China gave the US two pandas. In this edited conversation, Nixon and his wife Pat discuss the animals&apos; impending arrival in Washington: Richard Nixon The weather&apos;s good here, they [the pandas] can live in this kind of weather when they get here. We don&apos;t know when it [the arrival] is, but around the first of April, if you&apos;re here, it&apos;d be awfully nice if you go out [to meet them] Pat Nixon Oh, yeah. I&apos;d like to ...

Even without his head (lost over the intervening two millennia), he looks a brute: arms like sides of beef and a belly big enough to stop sunlight reaching his legs. He was meant to entertain the emperor in his afterlife. Qin Shihuangdi, China&apos;s first emperor, needed a fierce army for the next world but wanted more than mere military power - so he ordered bronze animals, clay acrobats and, yes, weightlifters. Two thousand years on, the Middle Kingdom&apos;s latest rulers are starting to show their softer side, this time to other countries. Being the world&apos;s next superpower is not enough; China also wants to be if not loved then at least liked a little. The Chinese have certainly not had much love recently: in the past few months they have been blamed for poisoned pet food and toxic toys, and accused of angling to take over western companies. Running through all this is the suspicion that the People&apos;s Republic is less trading partner than outright threat. Beijing has responded by going on an international charm offensive. It wants the warriors of Xi&apos;an to act as ceramic diplomats, reminding us of their home&apos;s ancient glory. Other strategically important nations - Japan, the US, even Taiwan - have also been given the terracotta treatment by the communist government: the deal enabling the terracotta army to come here was signed at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square, in front of the then prime minister, Tony Blair, and China&apos;s premier, Wen Jiabao. And China&apos;s media has been closely following our excitement over its latest export. The British Museum&apos;s exhibition is regularly on television, while the official English-language newspaper delights in what it calls &quot;China fever&quot;. From the foreigner bearing gifts for an imperial court to British Council offices around the world, cultural diplomacy is nothing new; but today&apos;s practitioners are. The politburo is famously good at hard power: high-level deals and economic might. But soft power was not part of the armoury - until globalisation, with its dependence on international business relations, made it a necessity. Not only archaeological treasure is being dispensed, but aid too: American allies like the Philippines now get more money from Beijing than Washington. China&apos;s marketing drive will reach its climax next year with the Beijing Olympics. But after the charm wears off the Communist party should be asked some hard questions: about crackdowns on dissent, about how it executes thousands, and about the conditions that face its workers.

In contrast, seeing no sign of Chinese gunboats in the East River, and reckoning that the worst that could happen was my missing the 2008 Olympics, the bluster reinforced my determination. On Friday I appeared not only with President Chen on a video link but with John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN, in person, and on Saturday on a platform with the Taiwanese sea-goddess Matsu, flown over on her own seat to New York. I was thinking that if Bolton and I could agree on any issue, Matsu may have been working hard on the miracle front. She will have to work even harder to get Beijing in a reasonable mode. China&apos;s diplomat told me that Chen was a trouble-maker, and took even more umbrage when I pointed out that in fact it was the mainland that was pointing almost a thousand missiles at Taiwan, and not the other way round. &quot;We will consider that you support Taiwanese independence,&quot; she accused ominously. Actually, I pointed out that I was neutral on that question, which was up to the Taiwanese to decide, but that I did strongly support their right to decide, just as I had vociferously supported the right to self determination of the Timorese, the Sahrawis of the Western Sahara, Palestinians and Kosovans. &quot;That is in violation of international law,&quot; she snapped. Well, no, I pointed out. Self-determination for former colonial territories was a basic principle of the United Nations, and indeed Mao told Edgar Snow, as reported in Red Star Over China, that Formosa - as Taiwan was then known - would be able to choose its own destiny when Japan was defeated. The PRC is more used to an attitude of &quot;whatever you say, comrade,&quot; than being argued with, and it all just seemed to make her angrier. However, as often, the discussion made me think. Possibly the worst way to dissuade people who are determined to secede is to try to bully them. I pointed out that if forty years ago Spain had made nice with the Gibraltarians, then by now the people on the Rock would be petitioning to join Spain and buy all those giveaway fincas along the coast. If the British had given Ireland dominion status before the first world war, Mrs Windsor would likely be making annual visits to open the Irish parliament. In contrast , much later in the century, London had conceded bilingualism, and Welsh radio and TV and in the end almost had to force the Welsh to accept devolution. The negative examples, from Timor to Kosovo are quite clear. Battering people into loyalty is a highly ineffective strategy. So why should anyone worry about a small faraway island of which we know little? Well of course, there is the little matter that Taiwan is a democracy, whose people want to choose their own fate, but experience teaches us that defending democracy usually only works politically in conjunction with less altruistic motives. Well, there is one serious matter of self-interest for much of the globe. Of course it is a bit much to expect a joined-up foreign policy from the Bush administration but even so I was shocked to discover that Washington, kowtowing to Beijing, has almost no official contacts with Taiwan - even though the US is committed to defending the island against Chinese attacks. They restricted President Chen to a 15 minute stopover in Alaska on his last trip back from central America. They do not allow him to visit Washington. That is seriously worrying. US should keep its word to Taiwan. But the signals it is currently sending to China, of acquiescence to its policies towards the island, are reminiscent of those Margaret Thatcher sent to Galtieri of Argentina over the Falklands.

Born in Stuttgart, she moved with her family to Spain and began dance lessons at 10, in Madrid. But her main training was at Elmhurst Ballet School, Surrey, and Ballet Rambert, before moving in 1996 to Sydney, where she studied with Tanya Pearson, a leading Russian-born ballet teacher. A dancer of sinuous grace and eloquent line, she was also gifted creatively, and in 1998 a fellowship took her to Canberra&apos;s Australian Choreographic Centre. A year later she joined Australian Dance Theatre (ADT) in Adelaide, where her talents were nurtured by director Garry Stewart and she met her future partner, fellow dancer Solon Ulbrich. One of her works, To My Suite (2000), in which a couple do battle for a packet of popcorn on, over, around and behind a sofa, expressed a quirky humour through witty, pliant movement. This and another short piece, Forever You (1999), were both listed as critics&apos; choices in Dance Australia magazine for most promising choreography. In 2002, an Australia Council award led to Endstation Wunderkind, a work exploring multimedia, text and dance, and while her position as a dancer with the ground-breaking ADT was assured, in 2003 she left to pursue more choreographic opportunities in Germany, Brazil, Taiwan and Scotland. She continued performing, joining Lloyd Newson&apos;s London-based DV8 company in 2003, impressing strongly as a dodgy seaside circus performer in The Cost of Living, and as a prattling, glitzy hostess in Just for Show. Newson admired &quot;her steely determination, intertwined with kindness, to make art and life work harmoniously&quot;. The Cost of Living was made into an award-winning Channel 4 film (2004) and toured in the UK and Europe, while Just for Show toured in the UK, Europe and the far east. She returned to Australia in 1996 to develop the hour-long Twelfth Floor. This dark but also tender and humorous piece confined three men and a girl in a room where they were chivvied and tormented by a domineering matron; despite some nasty violence, the ending had a chink of hope. The brilliance lay in Liedtke&apos;s control of emotion, character and mood through an inventive range of movement, from lyricism to athleticism. The work won the 2006 Australian Dance Award for outstanding choreography. In May this year, Construct premiered at London&apos;s Purcell Room, the Times proclaiming it &quot;a small-scale marvel&quot;. Liedtke herself performed with former ADT colleagues Kristina Chan and Paul White. The next day, the David Hughes Dance Company premiered Imploded, an energetically gymnastic take on Les Sylphides, at the Traverse in Edinburgh. In the same month it was announced that Liedtke had been appointed artistic director of Sydney Dance Company, selected from 54 applicants to succeed Graeme Murphy, the company&apos;s leader since 1976. In December she had emailed a friend, &quot;Sol and I are applying for the position at Sydney Dance Co, and while probably way out of our league it is really exciting to dream up what we might do with ongoing support and a company of permanent performers. It is stretching our vision and that process in itself is really really riveting.&quot; Tall, whip-slim and titian-haired, she had understated sophistication, a mischievous sense of humour and was intensely focused.

It is time for some perspective: why should we take it for granted that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is the supreme evil being and a super-klutz at the same time? The ungracious introduction to Ahmadinejad&apos;s talk by Lee Bollinger, the Columbia University president, read more like a plea to Fox News and the ADL to give him a break for not calling off the event. Think of all the people who took umbrage at President Bush&apos;s intellect and morals being belittled last year. Did Bollinger not realize that he was doing Hugo Ch\u00e1vez imitations? As the born-again atheist author of Rum, and a not infrequent imbiber, I am no great fan of Ahmadinejad. But he was elected by a much clearer majority, with a much bigger turnout, than his equally religious, teetotalling colleague President Bush. And for those impressed by that sort of thing, the Iranian president volunteered for the front in the war against Saddam Hussein - in contrast to Bush, who dodged the draft, and most of the present White House team, who were then enthusiastic backers of Saddam. Iran has not invaded any other country since the Islamic revolution. The Shah, who had his own nuclear programme, was a close friend and strategic ally not only of the US but of Israel, and apartheid South Africa. But we forgave him his part in maintaining apartheid, just as we forgave ourselves, and indeed Israel, for arming, financing and supporting a pernicious, evil and racist regime. So, of what is Ahmadinejad guilty? He supports the death penalty? Anyone would think he was a Texas governor. Is the president of China ostracized for threatening to rain missiles on Taiwan, for not having elections, or for executing thousands of people a year? No, we give him the Olympics, and all the TV channels will be there. The Iranian president does seem very obtuse about gays, denying that Iran had any. But homosexual acts still carry a 15-year prison sentence in many Caribbean islands that the more innocent cruise to so insouciantly. And only a few decades ago the US, UK and other European countries had similar penalties. Ahmadinejad has been totally insensitive about the Holocaust, though at last in his speech, he certainly seemed to accept that it happened. But then he asked the very legitimate question of why the Palestinians should have to pay the price for European anti-semitism. It is a question that no one has, or can, answer satisfactorily without invoking divine sanctions. Then there is the famous mistranslation of Israel being wiped off the map. It has been quoted so often now that it has attained, dare we say, myth-like proportions. But he did not say that. The original Farsi, as several more inquisitive researchers have demonstrated, did not have that apocalyptic flavouring. It meant that he would like Israel, as a state, to go away. Not genocide. Not massacring the population. Not even putting them on boats. At Columbia he seemed to be advocating a one state solution - which more and more Palestinians and even some Israelis are returning to in the face of Israel&apos;s continuing avoidance of a genuine, occupation-free two state solution. Certainly Ahmadinejad has blood on his hands - mostly Iranian. But when Ariel Sharon came to town with the stench of sun-bloated cadavers from Sabra and Shatila lingering over him, many of the people demonstrating against Ahmadinejad had probably attended rubber chicken fundraisers with him. And on both the death penalty and women: Saudi Arabia has the death penalty while Saudi women can neither drive nor vote. In fact Saudi men can&apos;t vote in any meaningful way either. Anti-semitism? Iran has 20,000 Jews who refuse to leave. Not many Jews can get into Saudi Arabia. But who says no to Saudi princes, oil or money, unless they support Palestinians? And then we come to the nuclear issue. The IAEA Council, under ferocious American pressure, which included giving India a free pass on its overt nuclear weapons, in effect broke its own charter by saying that Iran could not refine its own uranium. And then it went to the security council to repeat the process. The Ayatollahs say the bomb is un-Islamic. I would love the National Evangelical Association to declare it to be un-Christian, or the chief rabbis of Israel to declare it un-Talmudic, but then the US and Israel are nuclear states. Iran is a member of the non-proliferation treaty and allows inspections, and the IAEA thinks that its nuclear programme is under control. It is mystifying why the Iranians are courting disaster even if they are technically correct about their legal position. The nuclear issue only makes sense as brinkmanship, trying to get the US to talk. It is very dangerous and na\u00efve, and perhaps underestimates the craziness of the people they are dealing with. Nixon used being mad as a tactic. Bush has made it a lifestyle option in international politics. When we suddenly find Muhamed El-Baradei, the IAEA head, becoming an honorary acolyte of the axis of evil for Washington, it is d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again. Some people want war with Iran, very, very badly. As much as they wanted it with Saddam Hussein. Chavez is a thuggish populist, who was elected. Ahmadinehjad, a na\u00efve, fundamentalist one, was also elected. I would not have voted for either of them. But I would not vote for war on them and their peoples either - not unless I wanted to consolidate their support and power."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/sep/26/rugbyunion.rugbyworldcup20079", "publicationDate": "2007-09-26T14:51:57Z", "tags": ["Sport", "Rugby union", "Rugby World Cup 2007", "Japan rugby union team", "Rugby World Cup"], "sentences": ["Daisuke Ohata overtook his tally of 64 at the end of last year); the 60 points Toru Kuihara scored in a single match against Taiwan in 2002 is a world record; Kosuke Endo&apos;s two tries this World Cup are both candidates for try of the tournament; their domestic league rivals the big ones of Europe for attracting Aussie and Kiwi superstars looking to earn more money than they do at home."], "title": "Rugby World Cup: Michael Aylwin on Japanese rugby", "article": "And so Japan are being led away from this tournament, kicking and screaming, still just short of the redemption of a first World Cup win since 1991, and still rugby in Asia awaits take-off. The way Japan snatched an unlikely draw last night in Bordeaux neatly reflected the Japanese rugby experience of recent times - frantic, pacy, unconventional, shrouded in mystery and controversy, but never lacking in drama. First, some things about Japan: they boast the fourth highest number of registered rugby players in the world, behind only England, France and South Africa; they boast international rugby&apos;s most prolific try-scorer (you thought it was David Campese? Daisuke Ohata overtook his tally of 64 at the end of last year); the 60 points Toru Kuihara scored in a single match against Taiwan in 2002 is a world record; Kosuke Endo&apos;s two tries this World Cup are both candidates for try of the tournament; their domestic league rivals the big ones of Europe for attracting Aussie and Kiwi superstars looking to earn more money than they do at home. So when we say Japan are minnows, we need to qualify it, for they are surely a phenomenon rich in contradictions. But let us say it all the same: Japan are minnows - of the most glorious, crazy, diminutive, leaping-upstream-because-it&apos;s-harder-than-going-with-the-flow kind. And to be among a Japanese crowd who sense something is on is a joyful experience, as they leap to their feet, dressed in white and red, and shout &quot;Nippon, Nippon, Nippon&quot;. It is part of an exuberance that is matched on the field by their hundred-mile-an-hour team. If only they were bigger (the Japanese are a race small in stature, yes, but then you think of all those sumo wrestlers - where do they come from and why don&apos;t any play rugby?) and perhaps inspired by a more robust nickname. The Brave Blossoms is an improvement on the Cherry Blossoms, their previous moniker, but it&apos;s hardly going to put the fear of God into a mud-wrestling Georgian, let alone an All Black. Incidentally, has anyone ever noted how much Japan and New Zealand look alike, geologically speaking - an elongated collection of mountainous islands in the Pacific lying west of a massive land mass? Not sure exactly where I&apos;m going with this observation, or even if it&apos;s been made many times before, but there&apos;s got to be a point in it somewhere. One area where they&apos;re not alike, though - and this is where it gets harder to call Japan minnows - is the size of their respective economies. The IRB can get more excited about Japan than it does, say, about the Pacific Island nations, because they know there is a monster in Asian rugby that may one day stir and transform the global game. All of which made it so surprising that Japan were denied the rights to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup. The cynics will say that it was another example of the IRB blazer brigade closing ranks and awarding it to one of their own in, funnily enough, New Zealand, which may well be true. However, it was also poignant when we were on the Lions tour two years ago and New Zealand had recently announced their candidacy as hosts for the event. There was plenty of earnest lobbying from Kiwis pointing out to us that 2011 may well be New Zealand&apos;s last chance to host a World Cup, because the tournament is fast out-growing their limited infrastructure. Word has it, indeed, that 2011 is likely to run at a loss. Whether or not that had any bearing on the decision is open to conjecture - but it&apos;s a fair point. Japan, as undeterred as the best minnows should always remain, have already announced their candidacy for 2015 and must surely get it. England are also thought to be keen. Whichever of those is passed over could certainly hold it in 2019. Then there&apos;s South Africa who are due a shot. Australia will want another go before too long. Italy and Argentina, if they&apos;re not already, should soon be sufficiently established as international powers. And suddenly we&apos;re into the 2030s/40s, by which time Japan and/or China and, who knows, the US (another potential monster with an economy for the IRB to die for) may really be flexing their muscles and rugby may be able to call itself a proper global sport. By then rugby in New Zealand will still be the force it has always been (surely, let us pray so), but what power will they have ceded to those geologically similar but economically so dissimilar islands in the Pacific? So it&apos;s a fond farewell for now to Japan - yet another minnow to have delighted us at this World Cup. But it&apos;s unlikely to be the last we see of this particular collection of small fry.

He was the fourth of five children. His father left the family business, Wing Sang, the only Hong Kong department store of the time, to set up on his own in Sydney, Australia, where Tom was born. His childhood was divided between the Mar clan village in Canton, and Sydney. In China, the walk from the port to the village took an hour, but Tom, a chronic asthmatic, and his mother with her bound feet, had to be carried in sedan chairs by coolies. With a family tree dating back to 300BC, they were treated like royalty. In Sydney, they endured prejudice and &quot;No dogs and no Chinamen&quot; signs. Tom was orphaned at the age of 13, and his older brother Harry took him and three sisters back to Sydney to complete their English education. In China, their family heritage was lost when the communists invaded the clan village and seized their house and possessions. It was no surprise that Harry rallied support in Sydney for the nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Tom graduated in engineering at Sydney University and, in 1950, boarded a boat to London - the allure of the west was more appealing than Sydney, then a backwater colonial city, or the newly founded people&apos;s republic. He took a job at Dorman Long (later part of British Steel), in Middlesbrough. There were only two Chinamen in town - Tom and the man who owned the laundrette. Tom married my mother, Morag, in 1957 and had three children. Twenty years later, when they divorced, he moved to Durham to learn Mandarin. He also regained his mother tongue, Cantonese, and began to travel to Taiwan, China and Hong Kong for work and study. I felt he learned to be Chinese again. He revisited his clan village and his house, now abandoned, and met an elderly man who remembered him as a boy. After meeting his second wife, Julie, my father dedicated many years to helping others through the Durham Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau, Amnesty International and the Dryburn hospital. He nursed Julie through motor neurone disease until her death, and took one last trip to Australia and China before he died.

For the loss of 3,500 or so troops killed in the Middle East the American political situation has been turned into turmoil, the Republicans have lost control of Congress, the Democrats look like winning the Presidency, and the nation is undergoing absurd levels of angst. The eclipse of the United States as the hegemonic world power, and its replacement by China is a matter of time. One possible hope is India, which despite having over a billion people is democratic thanks to its adherence to the Westminster model. Should India be another waking giant, then she might be able to lead the world into a much happier future than the new Dark Age that threatens from China. Tristram Hunt Contrary to the John Pilger-Naomi Klein thesis, democracy has not been sacrificed to the demands of global corporations and mobile capital. Politicians, voters, caucuses and activists rule the world. It was people power that installed Hugo Chavez as Venezuelan President; it is the threat of a pummelling at the polls which will ensure the withdrawal of troops from Iraq; and it was the voters of Italy who expelled Silvio Berlusconi from public life. All these decisions have global consequences. Of course, democracy operates in a context of economic structures and power relations - but in contrast to the ruling army generals, church leaders, industrialists, aristocrats and diplomats of the past, politicians have more power than ever before.

In the last week alone, the Hong Kong market has leapt more than 10 per cent, while such tiny markets as Peru, Croatia and Vietnam have registered gains of more than 6 per cent. Overall, the MSCI emerging market index has more than doubled since the start of 2005, well ahead of the thirtysomething per cent rise in the FTSE 100. The scale of recent movement has prompted the inevitable bubble question: are these markets so inflated a spectacular bust is inevitable? Certainly, emerging markets are being driven by the &apos;wall&apos; of liquidity which was powering debt and equity markets in developed countries until the rise in bad debts among American sub-prime mortgages stopped the merry-go-round in its tracks. Asian and other emerging markets have been less affected because their companies are generally flush with cash. This is the legacy of their ultra-conservatism as emerging markets sought to rebuild their reputations following the Russian debt crisis of the late Nineties. It is also because the large investment banks that were responsible for creating the SIVs, CDOs and other securitising instruments - which are now freezing their lending as they try to establish what these instruments are worth - were largely from developed markets. That means emerging markets have not, as is customary, been hit more severely by the crisis, but have proved something of a safe haven. Their growth also looks more robust than our own, particularly given fears that the downturn in the United States housing market - and, as many commentators fear, in our own - feeds through into the wider economy. Peter Dalgliesh, manager of F&amp;C&apos;s Pacific Assets Trust - which last week announced that its net asset value had risen by almost 40 per cent over the last year - admits that Asian companies will not be immune to a global slowdown but, as he pointed out, the composition of regional economies is changing: &apos;Exports still make a material contribution, but not as great as in the past.&apos; In 2001, exports accounted for 7 per cent of Asian gross domestic product; last year, that figure was 4.5 per cent. And growing demand from an increasingly affluent population, coupled with heavy spending on infrastructure - China is to spend \u00a34bn on water treatment alone, while infrastructure spending both there and in India is rising sharply - should keep the local economies healthy. Nor are the stock markets particularly inflated, at least compared with previous bubbles. Dalgliesh calculates that the average price/earnings multiple, a key measure of stock market valuation, is between 16.5 and 17 times earnings, or around 10 per cent above its five-year average. In China - where the market has doubled in the past year, despite repeated noises about trying to rein back the rises - the average p/e ratio is considerably higher, at 49 times. But that is still low relative to the peaks reached by Taiwan (100 times earnings) and Japan (60 times) before the bubbles burst. The Hong Kong market is being buoyed by impending regulatory changes that will allow Chinese investors to buy shares in Chinese companies listed outside China - and many of these A shares are much cheaper than the restricted B shares to which they are currently limited. Capital Economics agrees with Dalgliesh that there is little real sign so far of an unsustainable bubble. &apos;Fundamentals have undoubtedly improved in many emerging markets over the past decade, especially in Asia and emerging Europe,&apos; says Julian Jessop, Capital&apos;s chief international economist. &apos;Overall, we are not too worried about emerging markets.&apos; Investors would, however, be wise not to plunge all their savings into these markets, which are generally much riskier than ours. The Pacific Assets Trust is a good choice for anyone looking to drip in a bit of money, while Aberdeen&apos;s emerging markets range is also very good. Ethical flagship stands by to take on boarders The F&amp;C Stewardship range of funds can justly claim to be the flagship of ethical investing: not only are they the oldest, having been around for 23 years, but they are also the biggest - a quarter of a million people hold them, representing half of all British ethical investors. Under the management of Ted Scott, they also have one of the best performance records in the sector. So Stewardship&apos;s decision to make the biggest-ever change in its investment policy is significant. The funds&apos; committee of reference, which decides what they can invest in, is to allow banks and insurers into the portfolio. Until now, the funds have been restricted to buying mortgage banks and community lending organisations, on the grounds that the more universal banks and insurers are bound to be lending to, or buying shares in, the very companies that ethical funds avoid. Karina Litvack, head of governance and sustainable investment at F&amp;C, said: &apos;In the past four or five years, we have been very involved in the engagement side of sustainable fund management. We have been especially involved with banks and insurers on how they can make their own businesses more sustainable in areas like how they lend and how they assess credit so that they can make more sustainable choices.&apos; The result is that a limited range of banks and insurers - including British giants such as Aviva, HSBC and HBOS - have been added to the permitted universe of companies. A sample of Stewardship&apos;s investors were canvassed about the changes beforehand, and F&amp;C says it has so far had no reaction. Rather embarrassingly, given the events of this week, HSBC was named by the US Securities and Exchange Commission as one of the companies involved in Burma. But F&amp;C says it was aware of this and is happy with HSBC&apos;s assurances that it has no direct investment there and that it does not feature on the Burma &apos;dirty list&apos;. Some may feel this is the thin end of the wedge: if banks can be allowed in because they operate in a sustainable way, how long will it take for an arms or tobacco company to qualify? Others may think it simply reflects the changing nature both of business and of ethical investing: today, the focus is much more on positively choosing companies that operate in a sustainable way - particularly those that will benefit from climate change - than on screening out the bad. Indeed, HSBC has just launched a global index to track the businesses it feels will be winners from climate change. Many of Stewardship&apos;s rivals already allow banks into their funds. Among the few which do not is Scottish Equitable&apos;s Ethical fund, but investors can also choose from a range of funds - including those from Jupiter and Henderson - that use positive screening to select environmentally aware companies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/30/foodanddrink.restaurants", "publicationDate": "2007-09-30T00:04:49Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["All the good Chinese places in London are generally not in Chinatown: the Royal China Group, Hakkasan and Yauatcha, Shanghai Blues, Taiwan Village and Snazz Sichuan."], "title": "Jay Rayner reviews Haozhan, 8 Gerrard Street, London W1", "article": "Haozhan Address:  8 Gerrard Street, London W1 Telephone:  020 7434 3838 Meal for two, including service: \u00a380 Haozhan is a pleasant restaurant staffed by nice waiters, with an interesting menu of well-prepared dishes. And most remarkably, it is on Gerrard Street, the main drag of London&apos;s Chinatown. Nice waiters? Interesting menu? Well-prepared dishes? Nobody goes to Gerrard Street for that these days. They go there to be shouted at by aggressive staff with personality disorders, and to eat food that will make them wake up the next morning feeling like a cat has slept in their mouth. True, the service in Chinatown always left something to be desired. I remember, nearly 20 years ago, eating a meal on Gerrard Street where the food took so long to arrive the sizzling dishes had gone sizzleless before reaching us. The waiters were so contemptuous of us that they made the noise with their lips as they brought the food to the table. When we refused to pay the pre-added tip, cooks clutching machetes came out of the kitchen to make sure we left. Quickly. Oh, happy days. But this, like the pathologically angry waiters at Wong Kei, was part of the pantomime. Generally though, a thriving Chinese population here ensured the food would be good if not excellent. In the past 10 years, increased competition, causing a shortage of skilled chefs combined with an obsession with the bottom line, has resulted in a charge down market at such speed it&apos;s only a surprise the restaurateurs haven&apos;t all got nosebleeds. The waiters on Gerrard Street are, for the most part, still aggressive and rude, but the food no longer excuses it. All the good Chinese places in London are generally not in Chinatown: the Royal China Group, Hakkasan and Yauatcha, Shanghai Blues, Taiwan Village and Snazz Sichuan. My old favourite Yming and the new arrival Bar Shu may be only just across Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho but that location is a declaration of intent. It says: believe us, we are not like that shower over there. But then there&apos;s Haozhan, whose chef, Chee Loong Cheong, used to work at Hakkasan, and where the menu doesn&apos;t just tour the predictable Cantonese staples but flirts with the occasional Japanese or Thai flavour. It even looks different: instead of going for decor reminiscent of your auntie&apos;s in Penge, like all the others on the strip, this one is modern with lots of clean lines, the walls fitted with mirrors and jade-green panels. And, whisper it, the waiters smile. The kitchen has a particular talent for deep frying, to produce items that are crisp but greaseless. A starter of crispy quail with chilli and salt, a dish familiar to me from Hakkasan&apos;s sister restaurant Yautatcha but available here at two-thirds of the price, brought two whole birds in a light, crisp batter sprinkled with aromatics which managed not to overwhelm the gaminess of the birds. Curry soft-shell crab sounded distinctly worrying (which was why we ordered it) but happily wasn&apos;t, the delicate creatures gently battered and sprinkled with shards of a fiery spice mix. My companion and I were divided over the spare ribs with a coffee sauce, which is to say he thought them odd in a bad way and I thought them odd in a good way. Yes, there was a bitterness to the sweet glaze on the thick meaty ribs, but also a certain fragrance which reminded me of rosemary. My friend&apos;s uncertainty didn&apos;t trouble me. It meant I got to finish them. We agreed about the star dish, the silver cod with a dry XO sauce of minced prawns and chillies. The generous slabs of fish had first been sealed off, but so sensitively that as you cut through the outer skin, the huge flakes of pearly fish fell apart. The XO part of this plateful simply cut through the richness. I would come here for this dish alone. Some other things didn&apos;t startle, such as underpowered scallops with macadamia nuts and stir-fried vegetables including a surfeit of out-of-season asparagus. The latter also turned up in a dish of Szechuan vegetables, which was more notable for the strands of silky tofu. Haozhan makes its own tofu, and there&apos;s a whole list of dishes using it which we should have tried but didn&apos;t. Convinced the Haozhan cooks were gods of the deep-fat fryer, we ordered their deep-fried ice cream, not least because it sounded like the sort of thing which would earn an indulgent mother a parenting order if she served it up to her kids. I&apos;m not sure it isn&apos;t, the ice cream buried under a sugared donut-like shell. Perhaps it&apos;s best avoided in favour of their calming and light pumpkin cream. As to Haozhan, it may well be the only good reason to visit Gerrard Street right now. jay.rayner@observer.co.uk "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/01/nuclearindustry.nuclearpower", "publicationDate": "2007-10-01T14:02:39Z", "tags": ["Business", "Environment", "Nuclear power", "Energy", "UK news", "Mining", "Antofagasta", "BHP Billiton", "Rio Tinto", "Lonmin", "Xstrata", "Vedanta Resources", "Kazakhmys", "Merrill Lynch World Mining Trust", "Mining"], "sentences": ["BHP Billiton has long-term contracts for the sale of uranium oxide concentrates to the UK, France, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada and the US."], "title": "BHP Billiton shareholders call for moral stand on lucrative trade", "article": "The world&apos;s biggest mining company is facing a revolt from shareholders who want the group to stop excavating uranium.

BHP Billiton&apos;s profits have boomed 27% in the past year from burgeoning sales of iron ore, copper, aluminium, manganese and natural gas, and it owns the world&apos;s biggest known deposit of uranium, at its Olympic Dam mine in South Australia.

BHP Billiton has long-term contracts for the sale of uranium oxide concentrates to the UK, France, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Canada and the US. &quot;There are major strategic tensions between some of these countries, along with Israel and Pakistan, all of which have the capacity to manufacture nuclear bombs,&quot; Mr Poppins said.

Because he could find only two reports in the literature of injuries from the practice, he canvassed almost 50 sword swallowers to explore their technique and its side-effects. &quot;Sore throats - &apos;sword throats&apos; - occur when swallowers are learning, when performances are repeated frequently, or when odd-shaped or multiple swords are used,&quot; he concluded. He went on to describe how one swallower had lacerated his pharynx as he tried to swallow a curved sabre, another damaged his oesophagus and developed an inflammation of the protective membrane around his lungs &quot;after being distracted by a misbehaving macaw on his shoulder&quot;, and a belly dancer suffered a major haemorrhage &quot;when a bystander pushed dollar bills into her belt causing three blades in her oesophagus to scissor&quot;.

If we sort on the initial &apos;the&apos; (as well as the following ones in their turn), then we are according each of the articles equal importance.&quot;  But she conceded that a blanket rule to incorporate &apos;the&apos; into indexes often led to long lists of titles starting with the word, making specific entries harder to find. A particular problem, Dr Abrahams added, was indexing the rock band the The.

Starting with Japan, this modernising wave has swept through the four &quot;Asian Tigers&quot; (South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore), some Asean countries (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam), and then to China and India. Now, it is moving into Pakistan and west Asia. I was in Pakistan during one of its more exciting weeks. Exiled former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, sought to return, but was promptly sent back into exile. The world expected a political eruption. Instead, the country carried on calmly. Pakistan did not erupt because Pakistan&apos;s elite is focused on modernisation. Led by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who was formerly with Citibank, the country has carried out dramatic structural reforms, matching best practices in leading emerging-market economies. This explains high economic growth rates. Pakistan has welcomed foreign trade and investment. And, just as the success of overseas Indians in America inspired Indians in India, Pakistan stands to similarly benefit from its own successful diaspora. But this opening to modernity extends beyond economics and finance. Yes, thousands of madrasas remain open and Islamic fundamentalism is strong. But this has not completely changed the fundamental texture of Pakistan&apos;s society. One sight at LUMS, a leading private university in Lahore, heartened me: how women were dressed. When I visited Malaysian campuses as a young man in the 1960s, few Malay Muslim women wore the hijab. Today, on the same campuses, almost all do. By contrast, at LUMS (which has the look and feel of Harvard Business School), only about 5% of female students wore the hijab, a remarkable expression of social freedom. There has also been an explosion of free media in Pakistan. An astonishing number of Pakistani TV stations openly discuss the activities of Sharif and the other exiled former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto. Indeed, many elements of an open society are in place, including - as the world learned in March - an independent judiciary. Burma, by contrast, broadcasts no information on the dissident Aung San Suu Kyi, and would never allow the reinstatement of a chief justice fired by its generals, as Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf did in March, let alone demonstrations in the streets in the chief justice&apos;s favour. Of course, there is much silent resentment about the enormous political and economic space occupied by the Pakistan military, and a danger of a backlash if the military does not learn to share more space with civil society. I met many retired army generals occupying key posts. Fortunately, they seemed to have a temperament closer to Colin Powell&apos;s than to either Than Shwe or Maung Aye, the two closed military minds that have cut off Burma from the world. America&apos;s decision to engage, rather than isolate, Pakistan has also helped. I have no doubt that closer American re-engagement helped to nudge Pakistan in the right direction. Many members of Pakistan&apos;s elite have been educated in American universities - another leading indicator of a country&apos;s orientation. Just imagine how different international relations would be if American leaders could visit Burma (or even Iran) with equal ease and have friendly discussions about agreements and disagreements. Burma&apos;s generals deserve to be condemned for their brutal crackdown on civilian protestors and Buddhist monks. The western world will rush to demand more sanctions and more isolation. But to what avail? Burma has effectively isolated itself for more than 40 years. What can even more isolation achieve? A courageous western leader might confront Burma&apos;s leaders with a threat that would really frighten them: deeper engagement. Burma&apos;s generals genuinely believe that they are protecting Burmese &quot;purity&quot; by shutting out the world. Imagine the impact if as many Burmese generals visited America as Pakistani generals do. A brave young Burmese intellectual, Thant Myint-U (the grandson of former UN secretary general U Thant) asks, &quot;What outside pressure can bring about democratic change? And why, after nearly two decades of boycotts, aid cut-offs, trade bans and diplomatic condemnation, are Burma&apos;s generals apparently more in charge than ever before?&quot; I was in Pakistan as a state guest. But my real mission was to reconnect with my ethnic Sindhi roots, as I had never visited the country where my parents were born. Only those who understand the pain of the partition of British India in 1947 will appreciate the powerful symbolism of a child of Hindu parents being welcomed back warmly to Muslim Pakistan. Those cultural ties helped me understand the Urdu and Sindhi being spoken, and also to feel the deep urge to modernise in the Pakistani soul - an urge that exists alongside the urge to reconnect with Pakistan&apos;s rich cultural past. I left Pakistan feeling hopeful, because I saw the strong desire to join today&apos;s rising Asia. If a similar impulse could be implanted into Burma, both its people and the world would benefit.

It involved killing all the kids in the hope he could get one. True believer George Bush certainly emulated Herod&apos;s single-mindedness rather than Solomonic judgment when he vetoed the bill to provide healthcare for millions American children currently without it. The president thought that the &quot;moral hazard&quot; that some kids currently insured with private companies might take advantage of in the new scheme was too much for his sensitive soul - so best let the other millions rot. He is not alone of course. Rudy Giuliani is trying to don the conservative crusader&apos;s anti-red cross with attacks on &quot;socialised medicine,&quot; which apparently means any rational scheme that would ensure Americans access to the healthcare that every other industrialized country takes for granted. And yet, in 1995, Taiwan, beloved of conservatives like John Bolton, introduced a single-payer healthcare system that delivers universal coverage with free choice of doctors and hospitals and no waiting lists. When the Taiwanese set up the system more than 40% of the population was uninsured. They are now covered by the national health insurance scheme - and because of the increased efficiency of the single-payer system - this was done at little or no extra cost. Giuliani notwithstanding, Taiwan&apos;s &quot;socialised medicine&quot; involves no more compulsion than the US social security system. It is a compulsory, mostly premium-financed insurance system, which negotiates a single payment schedule with the municipal- or government-owned providers and the 70% or so of private hospitals and clinics. Taiwanese do not have to worry that changing or losing their jobs will lose them their healthcare. They do not have to make choices between paying the food bills and getting essential prescriptions. Their doctors will not drop their insurance coverage, nor do they get post-operative sticker shock when they discover the anesthetist the hospital booked does not accept their insurance. They do not have to worry about big bills for out-of-network providers - because if a doctor is out of the network the chances are they were thrown out for fraud or malpractice. No wonder Taiwan had time and attention to spare to develop the iPhone while the US was developing sub-prime mortgages. The doctors like it as well. They are assured payment without wrestling with cost-cutting HMO bureaucrats who get bonuses and promotions based on how many treatment courses they can deny. There are no prohibitions on doctors operating outside the Taiwanese system - but no one in his right mind will go to one when they can go to any in-system provider and, for nominal (try $1.50!) co-payments, simply have their insurance card scanned, confident that the NHI will settle the bill with none of the hassle that Americans have come to know and hate from HMO&apos;s and multiple billings from different practitioners. Most astoundingly, for any capitalist with an accountant, is the difference in costs and efficiency. Taiwan gives everyone healthcare for less than one sixth the price per head of the US. In fact by 2005, US healthcare amounted to almost $2 trillion, or $6,697 per person, amounting to 16% of GDP - and still left 47 million people without insurance, more than 20 million inadequately covered, and, as GM&apos;s recent manoeuvres show, untold millions more whose insurance is not as secure as they once thought. Taiwan spent 5.7% of GDP and less than $900 a head. The Taiwanese service offers in- and out-patient care, house calls, physiotherapy, Chinese medicine, and even dentistry - all for premiums that in New York would not get dental coverage alone. If this is socialised medicine, then Americans really need it, no matter how much the health insurance companies are paying into the campaigns of Rudy and Hillary. In 2005, polls showed that 72.5% of Taiwanese are happy with the system - and when they are unhappy, it&apos;s with the cost of premiums, laughably small though they are by American standards: less than $20 a month. In contrast, last year I paid more than $1,500 a month for a family of three in New York. The greatest irony of this is that the model that the Taiwanese chose was American -Medicare, the pubic system in the states that serves the elderly and was created by Lyndon Johnson and a heavily Democratic congress in 1965. Premium collection is similar to that of social security contributions in the US. Employers and the self-employed are legally bound to pay. However, unlike the US social security fund, the NHI is a genuine pay-as-you-go system. The aim is for the premium income to pay costs, but there is also a tobacco tax surcharge that goes to the NHI, and contributions from the national lottery. Cigarettes in Taiwan are ridiculously cheap, which is why no one has blinked at the proposal to double the surcharge. To implement a similar system in the US makes eminent sense and is certainly financially and organisationally possible, indeed relatively easy. At the present juncture an American single-payer system is even politically feasible, although it would involve taking on some big lobbies - notably the health insurers on whose altars Bush is prepared to sacrifice nine million kids. Things have changed since Hillary Clinton&apos;s Rube Goldberg attempts to keep the insurers at the fundraising dinners. The spread of HMO&apos;s has devalued medical insurance. How many doctors will hang themselves from their stethoscopes to keep the present nightmarish bureaucracy of unqualified cost cutters? Among the political obstacles to a sane emulation of the Taiwanese system, the tobacco lobby could be disarmed - it could almost present smoking as virtuous if it helped finance universal healthcare. Is it really too much to think that the $250bn global tobacco settlement could be allocated to a health insurance scheme instead of, in effect, providing walking round money for the governors of the states? Of course the pharmaceutical industry would scream, since one of the major points of cost control for the Taiwanese system is that NHI is a monopoly purchaser and so has greater bargaining power with the drug companies and with the providers. So if the GOP is out the picture, who is going to stand up in public for higher prescription costs or higher premiums? It is not just the 47 million uninsured who can be mobilized. GM&apos;s hiving off its healthcare obligations to the auto workers union, soon to be emulated by others, sends a signal that not even the insured are safe. Universal coverage would also give security and peace of mind to millions of other voters whose coverage is threatened by unemployment or benefit rollback from rapacious corporate executives. On the practical side, much of the machinery is already set up. Among the IRS and the social security for collection and Medicare for payment, with the veterans&apos; administration and Medicaid rolled in, there are already the makings of a lean mean machine that would save billions in administration compared with the health insurers and their voracious demands on providers for paperwork from providers and patients. It would involve moving into the 21st century. Taiwan has an insurance card with an IC chip that provides essential medical records and collates prescription and treatment data - which is not only better for the patient&apos;s health but averts billing fraud. But that is a small step compared with the move into the second half of the 20th century that universal healthcare in the US would represent. The US is the only industrialized country in the world without a full health service - and if newly industrialized Taiwan can do it, so can Washington."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/08/naturaldisasters.china", "publicationDate": "2007-10-07T23:07:29Z", "tags": ["World news", "Natural disasters and extreme weather", "China", "Vietnam", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A storm drenched south-east China yesterday after killing five people on Taiwan and prompting the evacuation of 1.4 million people on the mainland, officials said, as the death toll from a separate storm in Vietnam rose to 55.", "Krosa killed five people on Saturday on Taiwan as it knocked out power to 2 million homes, according to Taiwan&apos;s Disaster Relief Centre."], "title": "Asian storms leave dozens dead", "article": "A storm drenched south-east China yesterday after killing five people on Taiwan and prompting the evacuation of 1.4 million people on the mainland, officials said, as the death toll from a separate storm in Vietnam rose to 55.

It is one of six apartments in the white, three-storey building, and Bruno fell in love instantly with its high ceilings, beams and unfinished oak floorboards. She has lived here for four years with her partner, Frank Elbaz, an art dealer, and their two daughters from previous relationships, Talia and Lune, both 11. &quot;It felt like home the moment I walked in. And we have one of the best views in Paris,&quot; she says of the magnificent Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale across the street. Bruno&apos;s home is a direct extension of her designs - clean, unfussy and delicate - and her penchant for the antiques shops and flea markets of Paris is obvious. She has an eclectic taste and likes to mix things up - simple 50s Danish furniture here, ornate Napoleonic-era there. &quot;I&apos;ve just bought a vintage Danish chaise longue covered in light grey knitted wool - it looks a bit like a sheep,&quot; she says. &quot;And I found a lovely low table this summer in an antique shop in Arles. I haven&apos;t found a home for it yet. Usually, if I like something, I buy it and then work out where I&apos;m going to put it. Maybe one of the shops, maybe home.&quot; At the centre of the apartment is a large, white-walled living space with floor-to-ceiling windows, framed with curtains made from antique tablecloths. It is furnished with a 50s Scandinavian sofa, 50s Dutch coffee table and 60s canvas chairs from Les Puces (one of the best flea markets in Paris), and a large antique mauve wool rug. Furniture is light and low to the ground, and waist-high shelves are painted white to match the walls and make them less obtrusive. There are paper lampshades everywhere - from the four suspended from the ceiling in the centre of the room to the row above the dining room table - and pretty embroidered cushions scattered around. Does Elbaz find it a touch girlie? &quot;It is feminine,&quot; he says, &quot;but I enjoy the space because it allows me to wind down.&quot; Bruno&apos;s career began in Japan, where she opened her first shop in 1996; today, her collections are sold from London to Taiwan, and fans include Gwyneth Paltrow and Kirsten Dunst. The apartment is less than five minutes&apos; walk from her office and one of her three Paris boutiques, but the boundary between work and home is well defined. &quot;My home is where I retreat to,&quot; she says. &quot;I never bring work back here. It&apos;s so important to keep it separate.&quot; The kitchen, once a boxy room, is now part of the main space - a small area of polished cement flooring shows where the room once was. &quot;Time with friends and family is too precious,&quot; she says. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to be stuck out in a separate room preparing food when we could all be together.&quot; The television is squirrelled away in a den. &quot;I have enough information going round my head during the day - in the evenings, I want a break.&quot; The walls are similarly uncluttered, apart from a few contemporary paintings. &quot;I tend not to have much photography, unless it&apos;s pictures of my family, because I&apos;m surrounded by photographs at work,&quot; Bruno says. &quot;Paintings require a different response.&quot; She props up framed mirrors and pictures so she can rearrange them on a whim. Bruno&apos;s touch doesn&apos;t permeate every corner, however. &quot;When we moved in, I told the kids to get personal with their own space,&quot; she says. &quot;We went out looking for nice chairs and other pieces.

Behind all this - and the big upward moves in other staple foods at your supermarket - are huge worldwide increases in the price of wheat and other grains needed to make staple foods. This time last year, UK farmers were paid about \u00a3130 a tonne for grain - now it is almost double at around \u00a3250. This is good news for farmers. And it has also been great news for investors prepared to take the risks of substituting sheaves of wheat and corn for stocks and shares in portfolios. They have reaped profits from price rises. Commodities - natural resources known as &quot;softs&quot; such as sugar and corn, and &quot;metals&quot; such as copper, zinc and silver, had been no-go areas for investors other than high-risk speculators for most of the past 25 years. But now some experts believe there is the once-in-a-generation chance to invest in assets which meet that overwhelming requirement for big gains - demand outstripping supply. And new financial instruments - called Exchange Traded Funds (see below), allow virtually anyone to invest. The City of London Investment Management Company is a UK-based firm which includes two natural resources funds in its offering. It says: &quot;We have had a bear market in prices for most resources since the late 1970s. Raw material prices have not kept up with other prices. But now the world is experiencing an unprecedented change in the global economy, backed by similarly historic demographic and social change. The world population is growing and a new middle-class emerging.&quot; That&apos;s the big picture. For foodstuffs, primarily grains which form the basis of most staple foods and feed for animals, the bull market argument has additional factors. Increased meat eating Higher living standards mean a major increase in demand for grain. Both inhabitants of mainland China and those in Taiwan consume the same amount of calories each day. But while the bulk of the Chinese intake comes from grain (primarily rice) the typical Taiwanese consumes nine times more animal protein. It takes nine kilos of grain to produce one kilo of beef so even a 20% growth in Chinese animal protein consumption will create an unprecedented demand for grains as feed. Biofuels Growing grain for powering cars, rather than filling stomachs, is bringing a major imbalance in the supply and demand calculation. US president George Bush&apos;s strategy to move 20% of transport fuel to renewables, including biofuels, will need huge increases in corn production. It could mean increasing the crop five fold. Land use  Arable land is squeezed by from spreading cities as populations grow and weather uncertainty leading to both flooding and desertification. But whatever the fundamentals, there will only be a sustained and sustainable market in commodities if big investors such as pension funds join in. Bloomsbury Financial Plannings&apos; Jason Butler says commodities play a growing role in client portfolios from cautious to higher risk. &quot;We use exchange traded funds to diversify away from equities, and to a lesser extent bonds, into soft commodities. We reckon other ways of investing in resources are gambling - you can&apos;t tell whether corn or cotton or wheat or whatever is going to be the best performer as commodity prices are very volatile. But this is a compelling asset and one not linked to ups and downs in shares or bonds or property.&quot; Adrian Messina at London wealth manager, IAF Securities, sees higher demand for soft commodities as the world moves to a western-style diet. &quot;There are more coffee drinkers in Switzerland than China. Imagine what a shift would do to bean prices. Over the next year, we&apos;ll be looking very closely at softs.&quot; And two major Dutch funds told a London conference earlier this month that they were increasing exposure to commodities, especially as new strategies aimed at big investors could help reduce the notoriously high risk of commodity investment. How to reduce the risk  If your idea of commodity dealing comes from Trading Places, the 1983 film starring Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd where fortunes are made and lost in minutes betting on the price of orange juice, you are not far wrong. Commodity prices are famously unstable - and taking a punt on whether prices will rise or fall can endanger your bank balance. You need a specialist broker and big wealth to contemplate &quot;futures&quot; - risky financial devices where you need to forecast prices in months ahead or face huge losses if wrong. But commodity-based Exchange Traded Funds - ETFs - reduces the risk factor by investing in a commodity index which looks at a wide range of foodstuffs. They are accessible to private investors, have no minimum investment, tend to have lower charges than investment funds and can be bought through any stockbroking firm. The ETF is a vehicle created by an investment bank. ETFs can cover a wide range of underlying assets including equities, currencies, bonds and commodities. The most commonly used UK ETF tracks the FTSE 100. Commodity ETFs are still rare - especially in soft commodities and farming. But they are growing. The UK based Lyxor Commodities ETF offers a two-way bet with a mix of softs and metals. Its annual total expenses ratio is just 0.35%. Last month, US investment group Van Eck launched an Agribusiness ETF which takes a different way into farm price growth. It believes the way to draw the most from food prices is to invest in a portfolio of 40 global companies including machinery and fertiliser manufacturers which profit when farmers do well. \u00b7  Contact: The London Stock Exchange&apos;s website has a useful guide to ETFs.

The world&apos;s biggest political organisation, which boasts more members than the UK population, will hold a national congress from tomorrow and the outcome has probably never had more significance. The Beijing Olympics next August and the 17th Communist Party Congress form bookends on a period of less than a year that will shape perceptions of China for decades. Compared to the sporting dramas expected at next summer&apos;s Games, the theatre at the Great Hall of the People this week will not make for exciting viewing, but it is the most important political gathering for five years. History suggests more than a few elderly political heavyweights will doze at their desks during speeches. Most of the important decisions will already have been made in advance. A few shifts will be made in the line-up of the Politburo, but President Hu Jintao will almost certainly be elected for a second term and his policy of &apos;scientific development&apos; will probably be written into the party charter. Why then the need for such careful scrutiny? The main reason is China is a pubescent superpower. Still growing fast, there is considerable uncertainty about how it will mature. The Olympics will be used to show off its new muscle, but the Congress is a chance to look into its head. Given the levels of secrecy there is only so much to be seen, but the effort of looking inside is crucial. Judged by appearances alone, China is a country transformed. Most first-time western visitors to Beijing are astonished to discover a city that bears no relation to their preconceptions. Far from the communist stereotype of a dull, poor, tightly-controlled nation they find a country that is chaotic, fast-changing, modern and almost as full of bars, clubs and coffee shops as the average European capital. For the Olympics next year, Beijing is expecting half a million tourists. It has spared no expense to impress them with the speed and scale of its development. In one of the great urban makeovers in history, swaths of the city have been knocked down and rebuilt in the past four years. The job is nearly done. The cranes and scaffolding are coming down. Foreign journalists are being invited to newly or nearly completed mega-projects almost every month. In August, we were shown the spectacular &apos;Bird&apos;s Nest&apos; Olympic Stadium; last month, it was the new dragon-shaped airport terminal, which will be the biggest in world; and two weeks ago, the giant titanium-and-glass egg formally known as the National Grand Theatre. These visits and openings are co-ordinated by the propaganda department of the Communist Party. The Olympics is an unprecedented opportunity for the party to show off its achievements in lifting 400 million people out of poverty. Never mind that much of this has been done with foreign investment and at a huge cost to the environment; the party wants to show that it has a new model to offer the world. Hu&apos;s concept of &apos;scientific development&apos; promises rapid economic growth that is environmentally sustainable and socially harmonious. Stability comes before all else, which conveniently means the party must stay in power with zero tolerance for any form of opposition. There has been no hint of a political opening ahead of the Congress. True to its track record, the party has stifled debate ahead of the meeting, clamping down harder than usual on the domestic media, detaining or arresting dissidents and blocking internet sites that referred to the Congress in anything other than the sanctioned form. But there have been huge changes and not just on the outside. People have more freedom to spend and travel than ever. Thanks to the internet, they also have more information, despite the best efforts of the censors and filtering equipment that make up the Great Firewall of China. Delegates at the Congress will be well aware of these changes, but whether they reflect them in policy and speeches will help to determine the fate of the party. Nor is the Olympics a one-way street of political influence. While China will try to assert itself as a new model of global development, opponents and the outside world will also see more and demand more of China. The coming year will be a tense one in Taiwan, where President Chen Shui-bian is pushing for constitutional reforms that China sees as a move towards de facto independence - something it says it will resist with force. Chen, who is at the end of his maximum term, has little to lose and he may gamble that China is so worried about the Olympics it will compromise rather than start a conflict that would overshadow the Games. The Dalai Lama will also look for some concrete results from his emissaries&apos; years of talks with Beijing. If there is no agreement over the future of Tibet before the Olympics, he may wonder whether it is worth continuing the negotiations. China may wonder if the political price it has to pay for the Olympics is worth it. Civil rights groups will push harder for reform in the coming year. In the latest attempt to use the Games, Human Rights Watch called last week for a moratorium on the death penalty ahead of the Olympics. Beijing has shown a willingness to compromise and take into account international opinion. The impact on foreign policy is already evident from North Korea to Sudan to Burma. Gone are the days when China could get away with vetoing or abstaining from every UN Security Council resolution aimed at criticising or punishing other countries for human rights abuses. Last year, Beijing signed up to sanctions against its old ally North Korea after Kim Jong-il went ahead with its first nuclear test. And, this month, China surprised many observers by agreeing to a statement condemning Burma&apos;s crackdown on anti-government protesters. It has also reportedly put distance between itself and Robert Mugabe&apos;s Zimbabwe. Most significantly, it put pressure on Sudan to accept a peacekeeping force after threats by US activists to call for a boycott of the &apos;Genocide Olympics&apos;. None of these measures goes as far as Europe and America would like, nor are they all being implemented because of the Olympics. But they imply recognition by China that there are norms of global behaviour and governments can be held accountable if they transgress. More should be expected. Thirty thousand foreign journalists are expected for the Games. They will push and probe and expose China like never before. For this reason - and after a concerted campaign by the Foreign Correspondents Club of China and foreign embassies - the government relaxed its controls at the start of this year. Under new Olympics-period regulations, correspondents are no longer obliged to get permission every time we leave our home base, which - in theory - means we will be arrested less often. Detentions are still far too frequent to say China has lived up to its promise to give the media complete freedom to report on the Games. According to the state media, there will also be unprecedented access to the party congress for the foreign media. It remains to be seen what that means in a country that organises one press conference a year for its Prime Minister and none for its President. Political reform still lags far behind the economic changes. However dull, the old style one-party politics of the congress needs to be placed next to the modern, dynamic nation that will be on show during the Olympics. Both represent this complex fast-changing nation."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/15/chinasfalteringleadership", "publicationDate": "2007-10-15T10:30:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Hu Jintao", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["On Taiwan, for instance, the tough PLA line is likely to prevail if only because nobody who wants to become party secretary dares forfeit the army&apos;s backing or be seen to flinch from doing what is necessary to retrieve the island."], "title": "China's faltering leadership", "article": "This week&apos;s Chinese Communist party congress will be a well-ordered affair - even during the tumult of the Cultural Revolution such meetings were conducted with decorum in their customary veil of secrecy. But the stakes behind the scenes are high and, given the global impact of the People&apos;s Republic, are significant for people thousands of miles from Beijing. One thing seems certain: Hu Jintao will get a second term as party leader, and continue to grapple with the problems he has failed to surmount in his first five years in office. The party remains intent on preserving the monopoly power it has enjoyed since 1949. Its leader knows it needs a serious dose of rejuvenation to make it better able to relate with the rapid changes in China&apos;s economy and society. He recognises that the wealth disparities and the gap between the coastal and interior regions have to be lessened, the economy brought into better balance and corruption reduced - even if his main graft targets have just happened to be political foes. The trouble is that, for leaders of an autocratic system, Hu and prime minister Wen Jiabao have shown themselves remarkably poor at getting results. Their Five Year Plan provides for annual growth to fall to 7.5%; it has gone up to more than 11%. The authorities urge an end to the bull market on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges; the index has more than doubled this year. Instead of slowing down appreciably, as pledged, the trade surplus in the first nine months of 2007 was greater than in the whole of 2006. Pollution targets are not met. Wealth disparities grow. A campaign to get corrupt official to confess produced a grand total of a couple of thousand repenters. Now, all the signs are that the Congress is about to bring evidence of even more serious weakness at the top. One of the main tasks of the meeting is to pick the successor who will take over the party leadership from Hu in 2012. (As befits a 2,200-year-old civilisation, the Chinese like to look ahead.) Hu himself was chosen by Deng Xiaoping who also picked his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. Hu had his candidate lined up in the shape of the party secretary of Liaoning province, Li Keqiang, a man who follows the leader&apos;s doctrine of &quot;scientific socialism&quot; and the pursuit of a &quot;harmonious society&quot;. Li was to be elevated to the top body, the standing committee of the politburo at the end of the congress as Hu&apos;s doctrines were adopted to put him in the pantheon alongside Mao, Deng and Jiang. But it does not seem to have worked out that way. The Beijing rumour mill, based on a mixture of leaks and interpretation, has it that Li will be joined as a new member of the standing committee by another man in his fifties, probably Xi Jinping, the newly-appointed party boss in Shanghai. Though Xi, who previously ran go-ahead Zhejiang province, is definitely identified with the coastal boom, his elevation would be not so much the product of policy differences as a matter of personal power. Most of the other members of the standing committee simply do not want Hu to get too strong, and so have been scheming all year to promote a non-Hu figure as the potential successor. Hu may gain some solace if Vice-President Zeng Qinghong, who represents the &quot;Shanghai faction&quot; led by Jiang Zemin, steps down from the standing committee, but at least one of his allies will be promoted and he will remain a powerful backstage influence. At the same time, various members of the &quot;princelings&quot; group - sons of previous generation leaders - are expected to be put into important posts. All this may smack of obscure (if fascinating) political manoeuvring without much relationship to the real world. But it matters for one reason: it shows that, five years after succeeding Jiang, Hu is a leader shackled by factionalism and unable to assert himself as the job demands. Policy formulation has been stumbling enough for the past couple of years; implantation even more so. Now, if the top leadership is to be the scene of jockeying for the leadership - for instance between Li and Xi - that can only get worse. This would be particularly grave coming at a time when the regime needs to get to grips with major challenges from the wave of liquidity bred by the trade surplus to the land, water and pollution crises. The leadership has to find ways to cut through the jungle of interest groups, administrative and provincial baronies and CCP immobilism to catch up with the economy and the deep problems spawned by growth on Dengist lines. To make the best of a bad job, Hu&apos;s acolytes have been putting it about that he decided not to name a successor in the interests of &quot;inner party democracy&quot;. Greater internal discussion may indeed be needed, but, as regards picking the man for 2012, this is altogether too sudden a switch to be credible. For the world, the main danger may be that a long-term leadership contest will encourage chauvinism as the contenders compete to prove themselves the best nationalists. On Taiwan, for instance, the tough PLA line is likely to prevail if only because nobody who wants to become party secretary dares forfeit the army&apos;s backing or be seen to flinch from doing what is necessary to retrieve the island. Overall, the prospect is that China will become even more of an empire without an emperor, headed by authoritarians without authority. The Communist party is not going to fall, or accept significant change in its status. China&apos;s growth is not going to be halted, even if the growing imbalances point to a serious bump in the road ahead. Whatever reformist ideas may be spun from think tanks and universities, the party&apos;s will to accept them, let alone to move to implementation is hardly apparent, particularly given the spectre of the collapse of the Soviet Union and its east European empire that is held up as a terrible warning at political education sessions for cadres. In contrast, as the fate of Wen Jiabao&apos;s policy pronouncements demonstrates, the economy has a life of its own, driven by factors which the leadership cannot control. The outcome could be that, in place of the ordered progress to the next generation of leaders which it was meant to achieve, the 17th party congress could mark the start of a new period of instability that will pose fresh issues not just for China, but for the world beyond."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/15/beijingbluster", "publicationDate": "2007-10-15T13:00:53Z", "tags": ["China", "Economics", "Sport", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["This evolution has not gone unnoticed by Taiwan&apos;s government.", "China has regularly threatened Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province, with military attack."], "title": "Beijing bluster", "article": "The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, was in Harold Macmillan mode today, telling his people they had never had it so good. &quot;China&apos;s overall strength has grown considerably and people enjoyed more tangible benefits&quot; under his leadership, he said. &quot;China&apos;s international standing and influence has risen notably&quot;. Perhaps he should be called Super-Hu. Yet the &quot;trust us, all will be well&quot; message emanating from the Communist party&apos;s 17th congress in Beijing is not entirely convincing. Independent experts say China is entering a critical 15-month period at home and abroad. And while Mr Hu admitted the country faced &quot;unprecedented challenges&quot;, his prescription - increased, centralised party control and vague promises of greater openness - does not look like the answer. External pressure on Beijing is mounting almost by the day, driven by perceptions that it will do almost anything to make next year&apos;s Olympic Games a success. The concerted international effort to induce China to adopt a tougher approach towards its wayward client generals in Burma is but one recent example. Ibrahim Gambari, the UN&apos;s envoy to Burma, is on his way back to Rangoon via China, with the US and EU egging him on. Probably only Beijing has the power to insist upon a genuine reconciliation dialogue. The spectre haunting Mr Hu, if he fails to act, is of renewed Burmese unrest, and more brutal repression, on the eve of his Olympic jamboree. The squeeze is on in numerous other directions. George Bush will tomorrow become the first US president to invite the Dalai Lama to a public meeting at the White House. The talks, following a similar move last month by Germany&apos;s chancellor, Angela Merkel, are a pointed signal to Beijing that, in western eyes, Tibet&apos;s lost independence is not necessarily a lost cause. Broader civil rights issues are increasingly coming into focus as China takes centre stage. Human Rights Watch reported this month that internal repression, including abduction and violent intimidation, was intensifying. &quot;In March, Yu Hongyuan, the Olympics Security Protection Centre&apos;s commander-in-chief, advocated &apos;harshly penalising one person in order to ... frighten many more into submission&apos; to ensure the success of the congress, the Games and 60th anniversary celebrations of the People&apos;s Republic in 2009,&quot; the US-based group said. Having given ground on its support for Sudan&apos;s government after Darfur campaigners threatened to label the Olympics &quot;the Genocide Games&quot;, Beijing is being pushed to do more. The US in particular is relentlessly stressing China&apos;s responsibility as an emerging global power to cooperate on shared problems such as the nuclear activities of Iran and North Korea. Slowly but surely, Beijing&apos;s non-aligned era doctrine of non-interference and non-intervention in other countries&apos; affairs, born of bitter national experience, is crumbling before a mixture of realpolitik and moralistic arm-twisting. This evolution has not gone unnoticed by Taiwan&apos;s government. Not coincidentally, it mounted its first national day military parade in 16 years last week and has stepped up its bid for UN membership. China has regularly threatened Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province, with military attack. But today Mr Hu, far from boldly rattling sabres, sounded almost conciliatory. Internal challenges to party control are also multiplying. After years of rapid growth, the economy shows signs of overheating and inflation is rising. According to Albert Keidel, a China expert at the Carnegie Endowment, food prices rose by 15% in July. Pork went up by 90%, instant noodles by 20%, and cooking oil and eggs by 30%. &quot;These are explosive price increases in key consumer categories,&quot; he said. &quot;China&apos;s economy looks today much as it did before the inflationary catastrophes of 1988-89 and 1993-1996 ... If inflation gets out of control, draconian steps to suppress it could cause hardship and social unrest&quot; - as happened prior to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Precedent suggested remedial action by the Communist party would come too little, too late, Mr Keidel said. According to Elizabeth Economy, writing in the Foreign Affairs journal, China&apos;s escalating environmental problems could also disrupt Mr Hu&apos;s hopes of steady national advances, resulting instead in a great leap backward. She cited Pan Yue, a senior official, who warned that &quot;the [economic] miracle will end soon because the environment can no longer keep pace&quot;. Large-scale air and water pollution, desertification and the illegal timber trade endangered the health and livelihood of many millions, Ms Economy said. But while Beijing was aware of the problems, local officials bent on getting rich routinely ignored it initiatives. &quot;Turning the environmental situation around will require something far more difficult than setting targets and spending money. It will require revolutionary bottom-up political and economic reforms,&quot; she wrote. As Mr Hu made very clear today, change of that order is not on the cards.

The world is split between people who play golf and people who don&apos;t. Each faction regards the other as an alien life form. One is astonished that any human fails to see that life without golf is not worth living. The other watches grown men in two-tone shoes dragging a bag of sticks round Teletubbyland, and shakes its collective head with incredulity. I regret that I must compound the incomprehension on the other side of the golf gulf by confessing that until three weeks ago I did not know who Gary Player was. And I am sure that - with much greater reason - he had never heard of me either. But now we are tangled up in one of South Africa&apos;s messiest controversies. I came across him while researching the column I wrote about Burma a fortnight ago. In trying to discover which western companies have been operating there, I stumbled upon a list of the country&apos;s recent golf course developments. He was named as the designer of the Pun Hlaing course in Rangoon. His website boasted that he had turned &quot;a 650-acre rice paddy into The Pride of Myanmar&quot;. I asked his company who owned the land on which the course was constructed. How many people were evicted in order to build it? Was forced labour used? As his company is based in Florida, did this work break US sanctions? It refused to answer my questions. I suggested in my column that Nelson Mandela should remove his name from the charity golf tournament Player is due to host next month. My call was taken up by Desmond Tutu and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu). The Nelson Mandela Children&apos;s Fund, which claims to own the event, asked Mr Player to stand down as the tournament&apos;s guest of honour. Player&apos;s company responded by claiming that it was in fact the joint owner of the event; he has refused to stand aside. The controversy is still raging. Cosatu has promised to turn up and protest if Player does not withdraw. One result of the fuss is that the Gary Player Group was obliged to issue a statement about its involvement in Burma. It maintained that &quot;the company&apos;s decision to design the course in Burma was actually humanitarian in that it took no profit from the endeavour, but rather encouraged the developer to put the money toward creating jobs, as well as the establishment of a caddy &amp; agronomy program ... the company was paid expenses only&quot;. Converting 650 acres of rice paddy in a country suffering from malnutrition into a golf course likely to be used by the generals looks to me like an unusual object for charity, so I asked Player&apos;s company to provide some evidence for these claims. The same statement maintained that &quot;Gary Player has always been a great supporter of human rights&quot; and has &quot;a solid record of campaigning for democracy around the world&quot;. To test this claim, I ordered the book he wrote in 1966, when he was 30 years old and at the peak of his remarkable career. Grand Slam Golf is well-written and strangely compelling: it makes the game seem almost interesting, even to me. But chapter two contains the following statements: &quot;I must say now, and clearly, that I am of the South Africa of Verwoerd and apartheid ... a nation which is the result of an African graft on European stock and which is the product of its instinct and ability to maintain civilised values and standards amongst the alien barbarians ... The African may well believe in witchcraft and primitive magic, practise ritual murder and polygamy; his wealth is in cattle. More money and he will have no sense of parental or individual responsibility, no understanding of reverence for life or the human soul which is the basis of Christian and other civilised societies. ... A good deal of nonsense is talked of, and indeed thought about &apos;segregation&apos;. Segregation of one kind or another is practised everywhere in the world.&quot; Journalists in South Africa pointed me to allegations that Gary Player was used as a kind of global ambassador by the apartheid government. In 1975 he collaborated with the Committee for Fairness in Sport, which was set up by the government to try to overcome the global sporting boycott. In 1981 he featured on the UN&apos;s blacklist of sports people breaking the boycott. So I asked Player&apos;s company questions about these incidents as well. All this is a long time ago, and Gary Player&apos;s attitude towards the apartheid regime is very different today. But another human rights issue is still current. There is a real problem with golf, and it is not confined to the dress sense of the participants. All over the world the construction of golf courses is associated with dispossession and environmental destruction. You&apos;ll find a flavour of the controversies it stirs up in Aberdeenshire at the moment, where Donald Trump is promoting a project to create the &quot;world&apos;s greatest golf course&quot; on a site of special scientific interest. One study suggests that an 18-hole course requires, on average, 22 tonnes of chemical treatments (mostly pesticides) every year: seven times the rate per hectare for industrial farming. Another shows higher rates of some cancers, such as non-Hodgkin&apos;s lymphoma (which has been associated with certain pesticides), among golf course superintendents. Courses consume staggering amounts of water. Many of them are built on diverse and important habitats, such as rainforests or wetlands. In some countries people have been violently evicted to make way for them. The problem is particularly acute in south-east and east Asia, where golf is big business, and land rights and the environment are often ignored by governments. There are hundreds of accounts of battles between peasant farmers or indigenous people and golf course developers. In one case in the Philippines in 2000, two farmers resisting a course planned for their lands were mutilated, dismembered and shot dead. Player&apos;s companies, which have a turnover of hundreds of millions of dollars, have designed eight golf courses in China, one in Taiwan, nine in the Philippines, one in Malaysia, seven in Indonesia and one in Burma. At least two of the courses in Indonesia were built during the Suharto dictatorship, when the ruling family was alleged to have had a commercial interest in most golf course development. So I asked the Gary Player Group whether Suharto or his relatives had a stake in any of the projects Player designed. As I was unable to find any position statements about environmental policy or land rights on the group&apos;s website, I asked whether it had produced such policies, and if so, how they are enforced. For the second time, the group has refused to answer any of my questions. I realise that in writing this article I might have made the great golf gulf even wider. I am sorry about that. But I did try hard to get the other side to state its case. I don&apos;t want to start a new golf war, but I do want some answers.

In a speech that will set China&apos;s direction for the next five years, Mr Hu spoke of the need to address the problems of environmental degradation, political corruption and income inequality between the rich cities on the eastern seaboard and villages in the poor western interior. Mr Hu was speaking at the opening of the 17th Communist party congress - the most important political event in China since the last congress in 2002 - at a time when the leader&apos;s words have never carried more weight in the outside world. Boasting of an average growth rate of more than 10% a year since taking power, Mr Hu vowed to continue the reforms that had pushed China past Britain to become the fourth biggest economy. &quot;To stop or reverse reform and opening up would only lead to a blind alley,&quot; he warned. In the political sphere, he held out the prospect of only limited changes, none of which would challenge the one-party system. An expansion of &quot;inner party democracy&quot; will give 73 million party members more opportunities to vote on policy and leadership, introduce a tenure system for delegates to congress and make the decision making process more open to scrutiny. For most of the 1.3 billion population, there was no clear timetable for an expansion of accountability beyond choosing village chiefs, the lowest level of government. &quot;Citizens&apos; participation in political affairs will expand in an orderly way,&quot; he said. &quot;Power must be exercised in the sunshine to ensure that it is exercised correctly.&quot; During his time in office, Mr Hu said the number of rural poor had fallen from 250 million to 20 million, the military had been modernised and the first Chinese astronauts had ventured into space. But, after record levels of protests in the countryside, he admitted that the party had struggled to keep pace with the rapid changes in society. &quot;While recognising our achievements, we must be well aware that they still fall short of the expectations of the people,&quot; he said. &quot;The governance capability of the party falls somewhat short of the need to deal with the new situation and tasks.&quot; Among the problems he identified were weak grass-roots organisations, excessive bureaucracy, and waste and corruption by a &quot;small number of party cadres&quot;. Last year, 8,310 members were punished for accepting bribes, but that figure accounts only for those who were caught and corruption is endemic. Mr Hu used the 135-minute speech to amplify his theory of a &quot;scientific outlook on development&quot;, which will be written into the party charter. It represents a change of focus from quantity to quality in national governance, and from revolution to plutocracy in party ideology. Instead of merely aiming for high growth, it emphasises sustainability and social harmony. &quot;Our economic growth is realised at an excessively high cost of resources and the environment,&quot; Mr Hu noted. He made his speech in front of a giant hammer and sickle symbol. But decades after the semi-religious reverence of Mao Zedong, the former hydro-engineer relies less on ideology and charisma and more on asserting his qualities as a pragmatic manager. Mao&apos;s theory of class struggle, he said, was an erroneous theory. Mr Hu held out an olive branch to Taiwan. &quot;We would like to make a solemn appeal: On the basis of the one-China principle, let us discuss a formal end to the state of hostility between the two sides, reach a peace agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;We are willing to make every effort with the utmost sincerity to achieve peaceful reunification of the two sides and will never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from the motherland in any name or by any means.&quot; Taiwan&apos;s government rejected the overture as &quot;devoid of significance&quot;. At the end of the congress, the party will unveil a new line-up of the standing committee of the politburo, China&apos;s most powerful political body.

Today, however, it&apos;s the tiny white hope of those who have aspired to have &quot;one laptop per child&quot; at a price schools can afford. This 850g subnotebook will inevitably be seen as a rival for the XO laptop developed by MIT&apos;s One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) for use in the developing world. The Asus Eee PC, by contrast, has been developed in Taiwan as a commercial implementation of Intel&apos;s Classmate PC. This is meant to benefit education, of course, but it&apos;s also about &quot;creating demand for Intel platforms&quot;.  What wasn&apos;t expected was the subtle positioning that RM&apos;s chief executive Tim Pearson gave the MiniBook during his talk at the conference. Using a graph that showed increasing functionality from a simple mobile phone to a desktop PC running Windows, he distinguished between &quot;appliances&quot; (phones, smart phones, Nokia&apos;s Internet Tablet) in the bottom left quadrant and &quot;computers&quot; (ultra-mobiles, laptops, desktops) in the top right. The RM Asus MiniBook sits in the middle, he said, and bridges the gap between the two.  Fixed functionality When the MiniBook is shipped running Linux, it&apos;s an appliance, and when it&apos;s running Windows XP, it&apos;s a computer. Later, Pearson expanded on the reasons for his approach. He explained that RM&apos;s business was increasingly about taking responsibility for the equipment used in schools. However, a typical secondary school runs about 250 applications, including specialist programs for music and video. If every child has a computer, this soon becomes impossible to handle: &quot;The support lines just get too big.&quot; But Pearson reckons that 90% of educational needs can be satisfied by an appliance such as the MiniBook, with its built-in web browser and office suite. &quot;If you&apos;ve got a fixed level of functionality, it doesn&apos;t matter what the operating system is,&quot; he says. &quot;How many of the people who have a BlackBerry know or care which OS it runs?&quot; The MiniBook appliance runs Linux, Firefox and OpenOffice, but they&apos;ll only be supported by resetting them to the factory defaults. &quot;I don&apos;t expect the man in the Orange shop to give me technical support on changing drivers: that isn&apos;t part of the deal. With an appliance, you can only expect to use the apps it came with.&quot; It&apos;s different when the same hardware runs Windows XP. &quot;If we offer an XP version, we will almost certainly support it as an XP system,&quot; Pearson says. &quot;We&apos;d offer full connectivity and support for any XP computer. That&apos;s the difference between an appliance and a general-purpose PC, though you might find it quite hard to explain that division to a Martian.&quot; Apple has taken a similar line with its iPhone, which it sells as an appliance. Because it comes from a computer company, runs a computer operating system (OS X) and does computer-y things like web browsing, many want to treat it as a computer. But as Pearson would say: &quot;That isn&apos;t part of the deal&quot;.  Brian Gammage, a research fellow with Gartner, reckons Pearson&apos;s idea makes sense, given the cost of the device and the cost of support. &quot;But let&apos;s not confuse the appliance function with the appliance support model, which means that we deal with it at the device level. When it breaks we either replace it or else we erase its contents and start again,&quot; he says. Gammage wants to take this idea further. &quot;The sheer scale of the markets and the issues to be addressed by the IT industry now mean that we all have to make zero operational cost and overhead a design function. That means we really have to start dealing with these things as sealed units. That&apos;s a broader trend. And it means that big operating systems have to become a thing of the past, which has massive implications for certain established companies that sell big operating systems.&quot; Of course, there&apos;s nothing new about the appliance model of computing: dedicated word processors, games consoles and some early home computers such as the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A were all designed that way. It also resurfaces every few years. The problem is that almost every appliance has flopped. The two biggest attempts to launch the &quot;computer as appliance&quot; idea were based on the NC or Network Computer and the PIA or Personal Internet Appliance. Oracle boss Larry Ellison launched the NC idea in 1995, originally based on a set-top box designed by Acorn, the small British supplier of educational computers. The PIA, which was hyped towards the end of the 1990s, was based on having a sealed box that accessed the internet.  Microsoft has tried harder than anyone in this market. In 1996, it launched a small modular operating system - Windows CE - for this new consumer electronics device market. It has been used in games consoles (Sega Dreamcast, Gizmondo), handhelds (Compaq iPaq, all PocketPC designs), mini-notebooks and tablet PCs (Compaq Aero etc), set-top boxes, cars (AutoPC), and mobile phones (Windows Mobile), as well as sewing machines, jukeboxes and other devices. It has even been used by Microsoft&apos;s rivals, such as Palm and Psion, without ever really taking off. Stripped down Whether computer appliances will succeed now is anybody&apos;s guess. JP Gownder of Forrester Research says that &quot;in a world where many households own more than one PC, there&apos;s more scope for specialised PCs. For example, a home theatre PC will look like a stereo component. This type of PC exists today, but more will come - PCs built for specific settings and unique consumer segments. Whether these will be stripped down to &apos;appliances&apos; is debatable, but I do believe PCs will evolve beyond just &apos;laptop and desktop&apos; into a much wider panoply of form factors.&quot; Whether or not the devices are appliances, it seems likely that the support functions will be. To get to the next billion users, the industry can&apos;t afford anything else."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2007/oct/19/headtheoldbloghasanewtr", "publicationDate": "2007-10-19T11:28:43Z", "tags": ["Higher education", "Education", "Freedom of speech"], "sentences": ["Now on the staff of National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, Ringmar says his new employers couldn&apos;t care less what he writes on his blog."], "title": "Free speech on the blog", "article": "Academic blogger Erik Ringmar, who fell out spectacularly with the London School of Economics last year, has returned to the attack with a book, A Blogger&apos;s Manifesto: Free Speech and Censorship in a Digital World. The LSE features heavily in his treatment of censorship. Ringmar resigned from the LSE this year, saying that the university authorities had made his life &quot;unbearable&quot; after he gave a talk to prospective students, in which he said that lecturers spent most of their time and attention to research. He told the students they would be taught just as well at London Metropolitan University (a new university leagues below the LSE in the academic pecking order). He repeated his remarks on his blog, where he also questioned why most of the senior jobs in his department were held by English academics. Sir Howard Davies, the LSE&apos;s director, warned Ringmar to apologise for damaging the school, writing: &quot;The issue here is not a policy on blogging, it is whether a colleague can publicly abuse his employer and his colleagues without consequences.&quot; The book expresses Ringmar&apos;s anger and bitterness at what he sees as the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of LSE. Now on the staff of National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, Ringmar says his new employers couldn&apos;t care less what he writes on his blog. &quot;They take the curious view that university professors should have the right to say whatever they like, both in their classrooms and online,&quot; he says. The incident divided the LSE. Ringmar got a lot of support from students - perhaps not surprisingly as he criticised &quot;absent-minded&quot; staff, and called the students &quot;some of the smartest, most interesting, intelligent, rich, successful and all-round attractive people on the planet&quot;. When the argument surfaced on EducationGuardian.co.uk&apos;s Mortarboard, opinion was divided. &quot;The issue is that a major academic institution that prides itself on its knowledge of free speech, are in fact experts on free speech, can not accept criticism of themselves and need to control information regarding themselves,&quot; one of the comments said. But another observer felt: &quot;Ringmar was not reprimanded by the LSE for telling the truth to students regarding the delivery of undergraduate teaching. He was reprimanded for making defamatory remarks regarding his colleagues both in his talk and on his blog. While he has a right to free speech, abusing that right to slag off colleagues is at least unprofessional and he rightly had his wrists slapped. It is clear in the LSE response that this is the reason why he was warned - to twist it into some kind of cover up of the horrible truth about undergraduate teaching and one man&apos;s struggle against the tyranny of the LSE management for his right to free speech is ridiculous.&quot; Is freedom to blog an inalienable right? Ringmar takes the most robust libertarian line. &quot;Should we behave ourselves? Should we fall silent?&quot; he asks. &quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Others - the Guardian included - insist bloggers behave themselves."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/oct/22/newsstory.sport2", "publicationDate": "2007-10-22T14:29:20Z", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Vietnam", "World news", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Damn chinks from Taiwan!&quot; Then a toddler runs up and tosses a baseball on the ground (causing the captain to shriek &quot;grenade!&quot;) and a baseball game breaks out."], "title": "Vietnam and Iraq?

Given that the Pentagon is packed with officers brought up on American football; given that generations of American football coaches have bombarded their charges with war metaphors; given that Mel Gibson is incapable of making a war movie without a climactic battlefield scene in which Mel scores a touchdown after he shoots, stabs or impales the opposing quarterback; and given that gridiron writer Marke Mask called his new book War Without Death (&quot;It&apos;s about grand acquisition and aerial attack. It&apos;s about covert intelligence&quot;). Given all this, is it really that ridiculous to argue that the disastrous invasions of Vietnam and Iraq were at least partly the fault of the games that America plays? Captain Collins of the United States Marine Corps says no. But we&apos;ll get to him in a moment. After 9/11 America&apos;s sports broadcasters promised &quot;to avoid the war metaphors that are prevalent in football&quot;. But when the invasion of Iraq started, it soon became clear that the boot was on the other metaphorical foot. In a mind-melting crossfire of groin-clutching Freudian machobabble, newscasters talking over pictures of young American men wearing helmets and body armour ranted like roid-raging colour commentators about &quot;blitzing, &quot;throwing bombs,&quot; and &quot;calling an audible at the line of scrimmage&quot;. Some critics pointed out that of the same thing happened during the first Gulf War: &quot;Commanding officers told their troops, &apos;This is our Super Bowl&apos;,&quot; wrote George Lakoff, professor of cognitive linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. &quot;The actual Super Bowl half-time activities mixed war and sports imagery interchangeably [and] the major American tactic was named after a football play.&quot; Others pointed further back, to Vietnam, where - for instance - the Pentagon called the bombing of North Vietnam &quot;Operation Linebacker&quot;. &quot;The thing about metaphors,&quot; points out journalist Brian Thomas Gallagher, &quot;is that they don&apos;t simply occur, they are devised.&quot; Step forward The Boys in Company C - a lousy war movie and a rotten sports movie but quite possibly best film ever made about the war/sports metaphor. Released in 1977 - two years after the fall of Saigon and the same year Pele joined the New York Cosmos and sparked America&apos;s first great soccer frenzy - Boys is a &quot;skintight&quot; low-budget peacenik &apos;Namsploitation film made by the same Hong Kong production company that churned out the Bruce Lee flicks. Despite being the template for Full Metal Jacket (and also starring Jacket star and ex-marine drill instructor R. Lee Ermey), Boys is not a cinematic classic. It was described by Time as being entirely &quot;shot in the flat light one associates with porno&quot;. Reader, I watched it for you. Early on the pacifist recruit offers the opinion that, &quot;Sir, the war in Vietnam is a purely internal civil war,&quot; for which he is called a communist and a faggot. Our recruits then sail to &apos;Nam on an aircraft carrier. Which is when things get interesting. &quot;Now men, I have a theory as to why we aren&apos;t doing quite as well as we might in Vietnam,&quot; says Captain Collins, as the company stands to attention on deck. &quot;Now, our thinking is shaped by the games we grow up with. The VC don&apos;t play by our rules because they grew up with a game that demands constant movement and fluid, shifting strategy. Now while you&apos;re on this ship, you will learn to play their game. And, gentlemen, their game is soccer.&quot; &quot;Soccer!&quot; gasps a private. &quot;Kiss my ass!&quot; growls another. A reel later we&apos;re neck deep in &apos;Nam. The Cong are in the wire but the brass are friendly-firing the heck out of their own men. So Tyrone Washington, the movie&apos;s African-American drug-dealer hero, storms into the command bunker, yelling: &quot;Man, you give us that jive about playing Charlie&apos;s games by Charlie&apos;s rules and you&apos;re fucking down here sending in plays like Charlie&apos;s standing still waiting for the ball to be snapped.&quot; So far, so simple. America&apos;s losing the war because it insists on playing American football while Charlie plays soccer. Like some days he mines the roads, and other days he mines the paddy fields. The crazy-like-a-fox soccer-playing bastard. Trouble is, out in the boonies, the fanatically pro-soccer Captain Collins is like the worst soccer coach ever, cautious when he should be gung-ho, and charging madly ahead when he should be getting 10 men behind the ball and keeping it in the corners. So to speak. Next up is an odd interlude where a VC suspect is captured in a freshly shelled village (yet another example of the captain&apos;s Neanderthal gridiron-style tactics). &quot;Did he have a weapon?&quot; snarls the captain. &quot;He had this club,&quot; grunts the sergeant. &quot;This ain&apos;t a weapon. This looks like a baseball bat!&quot; exclaims the company&apos;s drug addict and star soccer player, Pike (aka Twinkletoes). &quot;Shit!&quot; barks the captain. &quot;They know from baseball like I know from polo!&quot; &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; says Private Pike. &quot;Who do you think won the Little League World Series? Damn chinks from Taiwan!&quot; Then a toddler runs up and tosses a baseball on the ground (causing the captain to shriek &quot;grenade!&quot;) and a baseball game breaks out. But the fun ends when the evil, long-fingernailed South Vietnamese Colonel Trang turns up and, despite the protests of our heroes (&quot;He ain&apos;t no VC, he plays baseball!&quot;) tortures the kid to death. The movie climaxes with a grudge soccer match - the company C Muthas against Colonel Trang&apos;s South Vietnamese champions, the badass Dragons. And here the movie sticks a rifle barrel in its mouth and blows its brains out. &quot;All we have to do is kick the fuck out of them and we&apos;ll be out of this shooting match for the rest of our lives,&quot; says Washington, envisioning a career as the Marine Corps equivalent of the Harlem Globetrotters, apparently forgetting that everybody on the team is rubbish apart from the drug addict. But amazingly, despite barely having played the game, the Muthas cream the Dragons - by being taller, whiter and more American, but mostly by being gayer. This homoerotic theme seems to be entirely intentional. The Americans wear dinky cut-off shorts, army boots and sleeveless vests, and a formerly homophobic player rushes over and embraces and repeatedly kisses a comrade who he&apos;d previously all but gay-bashed. (During which interlude, the sneaky Dragons score a goal.) And then, suddenly, we&apos;re watching Escape to Victory meets The Longest Yard. The Muthas are told they have to lose. They try, but being American, they just can&apos;t. Then there&apos;s a Viet Cong attack and the entire ramshackle stadium is blown to bits. And then the surviving Muthas, still dressed like rejects from the Village People, march off to Khe San - a real-life &quot;meatgrinder&quot; battle commanded by generals playing gridiron against soccer players. &quot;I guess we&apos;re just gonna keep walking into one bloody mess after another,&quot; says a Mutha, grimly. But the last word goes to writer Brian Gallagher in his review of War Without Death, in which he directly compares the shenanigans of the ruthless, brutal profit-grabbing NFL (which, just like General Patton, regularly punishes its foot soldiers for having loose chin straps) to the &quot;banality of the military-industrial complex&quot;. &quot;Maybe it&apos;s time for a new metaphoric schema,&quot; writes Gallagher, &quot;in which we acknowledge that sustained profit, not conflict itself, is the point.&quot; Or maybe we just have the wrong people running the war.

The insurer, Britain&apos;s second largest, said Asia now accounted for more than half of gross sales, with the US and the UK and continental Europe splitting the other half between them.   At lunchtime its shares were up 17p at 747.5p, despite disappointment expressed by some brokers that the UK business was performing poorly.   &quot;The sum remains the same \u2013 good numbers from Asia and the United States, but the UK business failed to meet consensus and is just disappointing. They have a problem with that business and it looks like they are nowhere near solving it,&quot; analyst Kevin Ryan at ING said.   &quot;It&apos;s like a three-legged stool with two good legs and one withered one, which makes sitting on it very uncomfortable.&quot;   The company said sales at its UK, Asian and US operations rose to \u00a31.98bn. In the third quarter, insurance sales rose 18% to \u00a3645m, beating analyst forecasts and boosted by Asia, with the UK again lagging with an 8% drop.   There was no news of cost cutting, unlike its rival insurer Aviva which last week said it planned a round of job cuts across the UK and Europe on top of 4,000 already announced in 2006.   In the UK, where Prudential earlier this year announced plans to restructure and pull out of lower margin businesses, total sales fell 20% in the first nine months, though retail sales climbed 8%, lifted by individual annuities and corporate pensions.   The insurer gave no further details on the overhaul but said it was on track to lay out the remainder of the plan this year.   A failure to repeat some bulk deals in institutional business exposed relatively weak sales in retail business. The Pru has largely missed out on the surge in demand for self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) that have driven sales at Standard Life and to a lesser extent at Aviva.   A strategic review a couple of years ago saw the Pru stick with its sales of with-profits pensions and bonds in contrast to rivals that have, in the main, shifted to sales of the more transparent unit linked policies.   Mark Tucker, chief executive, said he believed the current stock market volatility emphasised the benefits of with-profits policies. He denied that the UK was weak, arguing that the shift to higher margin business was paying dividends.   &quot;We&apos;ve been very open about the strategy in the UK where we are doing a lot of work. People can see we have the highest returns in the UK and we expect that to continue.&quot;   He said the retirement of the US baby boom generation, which began last year, supported strong growth in its annuities business at subsidiary Jackson National Life.   &quot;When you have 77m baby boomers coming up to retirement and a country like the US which has two thirds of the world&apos;s retirement assets, it is a business that has momentum and we are well placed to catch that momentum as it grows,&quot; he said.   Jackson saw new business rise to \u00a3511m \u2013 a jump of 9% at actual exchange rates or 20% excluding the impact of the weak dollar.   Asia remained the growth engine for Prudential in 2007 and accounted for much of the outperformance, with sales up 40% at \u00a3939m.   India, where Prudential has almost doubled its number of agents to 256,000, saw nine-month sales up more than 60% at \u00a3126m. Taiwan, helped by a jump in agent numbers and a new variable annuity product, saw sales up 71%.   Pru confirmed it also remains interested in bolt-on US deals up to around $1bn without leverage and will also consider securitisation deals to hit targeted rates of return.   In fund management, M&amp;G saw a 30% drop on last year, though the net fund inflows of \u00a33.6bn remained the second-highest on record.

Eschewing the turbulent fervour of the Cultural Revolution in favour of stable growth, he has spent the 30 years since working his way up the Communist party hierarchy. The rise has been unspectacular. So much so that until he took pole position on Monday in the race to lead a fifth of humanity, the party boss of Shanghai was less well known in China than his celebrity wife Peng Liyuan, a folk singer in the People&apos;s Liberation Army&apos;s musical troupe. The stout 52-year-old&apos;s premier position among the &quot;fifth generation&quot; of communist leaders was signalled at the Great Hall of the People on Monday at a ceremony to unveil the new standing committee of the politburo. Introduced in strict hierarchical order, Mr Xi emerged ahead of his rivals, signalling that he is most likely to become the next party leader and president in five years&apos; time. To emphasis his status, Hu Jintao, the president, mentioned his name first in introducing &quot;the relatively young comrades&quot; in the inner sanctum. Despite his pedigree as the son of a high official of the revolutionary era, Mr Xi&apos;s elevation was a surprise to many politburo watchers, but it signals the growing strength of party &quot;princelings&quot; and the diffusion of power inside the world&apos;s biggest political party. Mr Xi was born in Shaanxi province in 1953. His father Xi Zhongxun was a veteran of the revolution who survived the Long March and became a vice-premier. But Mr Xi&apos;s privileged childhood was turned on its head by Mao&apos;s purges. His father spent 16 years in prison. It was only in 1975 that he was released, later becoming an advocate of reform. Like many &quot;intellectual youths&quot; in the Cultural Revolution, Mr Xi was dispatched to the countryside to learn from the peasant masses. It was a bitter experience that helped to shape his views. &quot;In the past when we talked about beliefs, it was very abstract. I think the youth of my generation will be remembered for the fervour of the Red Guard era. But it was emotional. It was a mood. And when the ideals of the Cultural Revolution could not be realised, it proved an illusion,&quot; he told state-run CCTV in 2003. He returned to Beijing to complete the first of his two degrees from the elite Tsinghua University. Unlike most recent politburo members he has a doctorate in law and ideological education. A communist from the age of 21, Mr Xi cut his administrative teeth in the fast-growing provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang. Foreign investors and diplomats spoke highly of his English, knowledge of international business practices and ability to get things done. He has twice been called upon to clean up high-profile corruption cases, most recently in Shanghai where the former party boss Chen Liangyu was caught up in a social security fund scandal. Officials such as Mr Xi have also come under suspicion because of the advantages they can secure through their family ties, but leading reformers believe they can be a force for change. &quot;Most corrupt officials come from poor families. But Chinese royals like Xi have a spirit that is not dominated by money,&quot; says Li Datong, a former editor who was fired for refusing to toe the line of the propaganda department. Privately, people who have met Mr Xi describe him as open-minded, friendly and not the type to put on airs. In public, his views on policy are largely orthodox. He is less bellicose than other senior officials on Taiwan, which China considers to be a rogue province. But on other matters his speeches have carefully followed the leadership line. Loyalty to the party, a lack of controversy and the ability to please all factions are the main qualities needed to rise inside today&apos;s communist party, according to Nicholas Becquelin of Human Rights Watch. &quot;There are no particular policies associated with Xi,&quot; he says. &quot;If you are tipped to go up the ranks, you have to be as bland as possible with nothing on your record that can attract opposition from rivals.&quot; In contrast to the autocratic rule of Mao Zedong, Mr Hu has had to balance the interests of rich and poor provinces, powerful families and patronage groups in choosing a successor. The favourite to become the next party leader had been Li Keqiang, the party boss of Liaoning who was a protege of Mr Hu&apos;s for more than a decade. But he was too close to the president for the liking of other powerbrokers, such as former president Jiang Zemin, so Mr Xi became the compromise candidate. &quot;His rise is slightly unexpected, but he has broad appeal,&quot; said a European diplomat. His succession is not guaranteed. But if recent precedent is a guide, Mr Xi will probably be president from 2012 to 2022. Before then, he will at least start to become as much of a household name as his wife.

Those who have not been to Asia before are looking forward not just to this trip, but to the March game, should United qualify, in Shanghai, probably against Bayern Munich. It makes a change from last year&apos;s jaunts to Miami and Boston. There is talk of Australia joining the circuit, but so far no one in Sydney or Melbourne has been able to come up with the \u00a3100million guarantee for the clubs. And the journey, even on Virgin&apos;s &apos;satellite shuttle&apos;, is that much more tiring. If United were scheduled for a Saturday game - most games kick off at primetime 7pm now - after a midweek trip to Australia, they would be back and ready to play, but ideally they would want a Sunday slot and if they have to buy one it may cost as much as \u00a325m. Talking of the weekend, this will be &apos;the big one&apos; for boxing, the richest four days on the sporting calendar. Not so long ago there were fears that boxing might go under, as UFC grew and grew, but tradition still counts for something even in the 21st century, and the ultimate fighters were seen off. By money, of course. The world&apos;s biggest brewery, still an American company, saw a way to tell the world: &apos;We&apos;ve been around a long time, and we&apos;re the world&apos;s best-selling beer.&apos; So they put in billions of dollars to buy up everyone in boxing and turn back time. There are now eight weight divisions, eight world titles - all sponsored - and everyone who cares will be able to name all eight of them after the Thursday-to-Sunday championships in Las Vegas. The forecasters cannot see how they will be able to afford it, but they said that about the China National Bank deal that gave birth to golf&apos;s world tour - and the booming target-golf circuit - and just look how wrong they were. A fifth major, held in China, looks a certainty now. Of course, &apos;being there&apos; is not what it used to be for those United fans. If you really must fly all the way to India to watch your team, good luck, but hardly anybody does because they are more than happy with their virtual sports studio back home. The dull old days of sport on television are long gone and now your holistic media centre in what used to be the lounge all but puts you there, behind the goal, in the grandstand, at ringside, on the 18th green. If you don&apos;t like that loudmouth over there, you can always move. Now, a quick flick through the e-pages to see what&apos;s going on today. Plenty about London&apos;s NFL team; the Pacific islands&apos; rugby play-off that earns the winner a guest spot in the Eight Nations; more headlines about the landmark appeal-court hearing over who owns the rights to cloned racehorses; a big preview to London&apos;s NBA game tomorrow - after beating Boston and Los Angeles in early-season games, they could top the league with victory over Madrid - and the indispensable guide to viewing in the sports room tonight. Andy Murray is in the turbo tennis grand finals in New York. He last played a grand-slam event in 2016, but he is still making a mint on the turbo circuit. No match lasts longer than 45 minutes, the whole thing is over in three days. Worth staying up for... Before you start thinking &apos;What a lot of futuristic, fictional nonsense&apos;, it is worth doing two things. First, listen to what some of the most important people in the sports industry think: not those constrained by working for a specific club or league, or for a governing body who have been around since the 19th century, but those whose job is to be innovative, move fast and gain an edge on their competitors. People with financial clout, people who, whether you agree with them or not, have vision. Second, take yourself back in time. Instead of going forward to 2020, go back 20 years to 1987 and ask yourself this: would anyone have believed it if they had been told what sport would be like in 2007? With so many American sports executives in London over the past week, for today&apos;s NFL game at Wembley, there has been widespread talk about the possibility of Premier League matches being played in the United States. West Ham&apos;s Eggert Magnusson caused a stir when he said: &apos;I can see that happening sooner rather than later - it would be good for the game,&apos; and he has an unlikely ally in Steve Bruce, the Birmingham manager who says, &apos;Anything that promotes the game has to be good. I really can&apos;t see a downside to the idea.&apos; A more likely scenario, given that there would not be such an outcry from fans of all league clubs, is the playing of Champions League matches outside Europe. &apos;That could very easily happen,&apos; says Joe Bailey, who played a key role in bringing the Miami Dolphins to Wembley for today&apos;s ground-breaking game, &apos;if they [Uefa and the clubs] think that, by doing so, they can generate new customers and develop new business relationships. That&apos;s for the strategic planners to try to figure out.&apos; Today&apos;s game is &apos;part of a concerted effort to establish ourselves internationally, going after half-a-dozen key territories to create some level of foundation&apos;, says Alistair Kirkwood, an NFL expansion executive. Why now? &apos;The best time to change is from a position of strength. In a way, when you have full stadiums it is more difficult to justify taking a regular-season game elsewhere, but that&apos;s what you have to do. &apos;What seemed like a whimsical idea a few years ago can now be seen as possible. If there is a business rationale for doing it there will be opportunities to play Champions League games outside Europe.&apos; Miami Dolphins v the New York Giants today is just the start. Roger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, can see the Super Bowl coming across the Atlantic, too. &apos;There&apos;s a great deal of interest in holding a Super Bowl in London,&apos; Goodell says, &apos;so we&apos;ll be looking at that.&apos; Bailey, who believes the American sports industry is 10 years ahead of the rest of the world, says the Wembley game, the first competitive NFL match played outside North America, is &apos;a foreshadowing of a lot of other things that are going to happen, not just to the NFL but to sports in general. Just think what&apos;s going to happen when India starts getting really active [in sport]. Think of what&apos;s going to happen in China.&apos; American basketball is all too aware of what is happening in China and is making a big marketing push there. &apos;Businesses, whether they are US, multi-nationals, UK, or Asian based, are not talking about borders, that&apos;s the game changer here. It&apos;s a global opportunity,&apos; says Heidi Ueberroth, who heads the worldwide expansion programme of the NBA. Can she see foresee Manchester United playing in Miami? &apos;Sure.&apos; Manu Sawhney is India&apos;s top TV sports executive. As managing director of ESPN Star, Asia&apos;s number-one sports broadcaster, he oversees a company expecting exponential growth. &apos;India is steadily developing into a multi-sports market,&apos; he says. &apos;While cricket continues to grow and is the most popular sport, viewing figures for English soccer have increased by 58 per cent throughout Asia in five years. Other sports, such as motor sport, golf and tennis, are also gaining viewers.&apos; Sawhney is a big fan of Twenty20 cricket, which has transformed the market in India. Women are drawn to Twenty20 far more readily than to longer forms of cricket and the recent World Championship final between India and Pakistan drew an audience of 400 million - 16 times bigger than the best British figures for a sports event. He and other top executives say &apos;short&apos; forms of sport will play a key role in the future and sports will have to adapt. The aims of the main sports remain the same - to score goals, tries, runs and points, or to be first over the line - but the rules have successfully been tweaked in recent years, leading to a faster, more entertaining spectacle, certainly in football and both codes of rugby, and in Test cricket. The biggest changes have been in the packaging and presentation of sport - and in viewers&apos; attention span. &apos;There is an inevitable conflict between what the sports federations want and what the public want,&apos; says Greg Dyke, the former director general of the BBC who was head of sport at ITV earlier in his career. &apos;Governing bodies always put too much emphasis on tradition.&apos; Guy Kinnings, head of golf at IMG, the sports agency and marketing group, predicts: &apos;There will be a growth in short-form golf because people will have even less leisure time by 2018 and golf needs to have a form of the game that allows it to be played in, say, an hour. I&apos;m sure this will be showcased by some of the top pros.&apos; Donald Trump, a keen investor in golf and one of the world&apos;s most famous businessmen, disagrees about &apos;short golf&apos; but sees a big future for the sport. &apos;Golf is very important for a certain group of Americans,&apos; Trump tells Observer Sport. &apos;It&apos;s not like football or baseball, it&apos;s the very high end of the market which advertisers love because they spend a lot of money on product. It&apos;s very important, it&apos;s very influential. Tennis has lost its mojo. Just lost it. Roger Federer may be the greatest player ever, but for some reason tennis is just losing ground.&apos; Maybe tennis must reinvent itself, too. It, like squash, is dabbling with a short-form version. American football is trying to push &apos;Arena Football&apos; - an indoor version of gridiron - as an Olympic sport. The value of live events will increase as viewers&apos; habits change, along with their means of consuming sport. The TV will be displaced by computer screens and there will be no such thing as scheduling as we know it. You will be able to watch Coronation Street whenever you want to - which gives sport a big advantage. &apos;In a world where you can download anything, you can&apos;t download live sport,&apos; Dyke says. &apos;Anything live becomes more important. The price paid by broadcasters will continue to go up.&apos; Sir Martin Sorrell, one of the world&apos;s foremost names in marketing, says: &apos;The power of big sports events will be there forever and they are becoming more, not less, important. There is a growing pool of money that wants them and a very limited number of sufficient quality and size.&apos; Sorrell - who is chief executive of WPP, one of the world&apos;s biggest advertising companies - adds: &apos;What companies are looking for are mass events that have a very strong appeal worldwide.&apos; If there are not enough to go around, but the money is there to &apos;invent&apos; some - as has happened with Twenty20 cricket - who knows what might happen? Back in 1987, no satellite TV company had yet been given a licence to operate, and those that existed, long before Sky&apos;s current conformation, were losing a fortune. There were no millionaire footballers and no paid rugby union players (at least not officially). Test cricket was shown on BBC, or at least home series were - no UK broadcaster had ever screened an England tour live, beyond a single session from Australia in 1983. The total income for all football from TV companies was roughly one tenth of what every single Premier League club is now paid. The highlight of the rugby season was the Five Nations, not Six, and the game was played by doctors and bankers and farmers, who look like matchstick men alongside today&apos;s hulks. Backers of the first World Cup, in New Zealand, lost \u00a31m. At club level, long-forgotten names such as Orrell, London Scottish, West Hartlepool and Moseley would be watched by a few hundred spectators. In tennis, Wimbledon had just made the radical decision to use yellow balls, rather than white ones, and commentators bemoaned the disappearance of wooden rackets. There was little sport on a Sunday, no football on Monday or Thursday, and no pull-out sports sections in the daily and Sunday papers. There was no sign that motor racing would ever stage a grand prix in China, Malaysia, or Turkey, much less a floodlit one in Singapore, as will happen next year. Britain&apos;s top boxer was Barry McGuigan and everyone knew who he was because his fights were on BBC1. In 1987 there was no such thing as the Premier League, and any thought of a Russian, or many Russians, investing in British football - plagued by hooliganism and hated by the Government - would have been dismissed as madness, not least because Russia was a communist country. Foreign players were still a curiosity, and no one knew which teams were in La Liga, never mind who played for them. The Iron Curtain was still there, Germany was split, and nobody in Estonia would have dared dream that their Soviet-run state would be free to play at Wembley as an independent nation, as they did this month. Wembley itself was an old dump that featured, that year, an FA Cup final won by a team who are now in what was then the Second Division (Coventry City) and the following year by a team who no longer exist (Wimbledon). Everton were the Football League champions. To qualify for the European Cup you had to do what Everton did and win the title, though all English clubs were banned from Uefa competition because of the Heysel disaster two years earlier. Teams from Romania, Portugal and Holland were champions of Europe in successive years from 1986-88. The Cup Winners&apos; Cup was a big deal. So were snooker and Saturday afternoon horse racing. Fans were fans, not customers of &apos;the guest experience&apos;. Very few wore replica shirts and most paid on the gate, stood up to watch and expected to be treated like penned cattle. And whoever would have thought Indians would want to watch English football - or, come to that, any football? Now, India is a magnet, as that 400 million Twenty20 audience shows. The newest form of cricket takes another big step next year with the launch of the Indian Premier League, which uses both the Champions League and the NFL as models for its format. Franchises will compete for a first prize of \u00a32.5m. The Commonwealth Games will be held in Delhi in 2010. In the same year the first Indian Grand Prix is expected to take place in the same city, with an Indian team on the grid, backed by the Kingfisher brewery. Golf&apos;s Indian Open will start in February - as part of the European Tour, not the Asian Tour - and other sports are coming up fast. India has never been as keen on football as the rest of Asia, but that is changing. Manchester United are helping to popularise football in India this week, holding a skills camp for more than 5,000 children aged 10-16 at the Nehru Stadium in Goa. Brian McClair, the former United and Scotland star who now heads the club&apos;s academy, is leading the pilot project, which was launched at the invitation of the All India Football Federation (the Indian FA), with the backing of billionaire businessman Sunil Mittal. Manchester United Soccer Schools and Nike are partners in the project. &apos;Investment in cricket and hockey has been going on for many, many years, and this [investment in football] is a very ambitious project,&apos; says McClair. &apos;Sport is a massive part of Indian life, and football can be part of it. It will grow, I&apos;m sure of that.&apos; McClair believes it will be &apos;a minimum of 10 years&apos; before football takes a real hold, but one top player could make a huge difference. Dale Hobson, international development director of Manchester United Soccer Schools, says, &apos;If you had just one Indian player in the Premier League, football would go into the stratosphere here. The scope and scale of Indian football could be colossal.&apos; Vijay Mallya, the man behind the F1 team - which he has named Force India Formula One - is also keen on football and says &apos;it can be as popular as cricket&apos;. he predicts that India &apos;will not only emerge as a global superpower in economic terms, but also in sporting terms, over the next five years&apos;. And not just on the cricket pitch. &apos;We have a very young demographic in India. We produce more than a million graduates a year. They are getting good jobs. They are basically looking for an alternative to cricket, and Formula One meets their aspirational needs. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if there&apos;s a humongous increase in television viewership of Formula One. For the sentiments of the Indian people, Formula One was always perceived to be out of reach. Now we have an Indian car on the grid it demonstrates that India has truly arrived.&apos; Nearly half the 1.1 billion population is under 20 and in a few years that figure will be 55 per cent. Over the next year, more than 130 new cable television channels will be launched across the country. There are 200 million mobile phones in use in India and predictions of 600 million within three years. And Indians love to follow sport on their mobiles. &apos;The young take their media habits with them,&apos; Sorrell says. &apos;If you are not part of their habit now you most definitely won&apos;t be in their future.&apos; Two-thirds of all overseas sales of the Premier League are in Asia. The World Cup will surely come to India: Fifa&apos;s Sepp Blatter went to Delhi in April, armed with cliches and describing the country as &apos;the sleeping giant&apos; of world football. Another &apos;sleeping giant&apos; is China, whose population is 150 million more than that of India. The Chinese New Year was watched by a billion people on the state broadcaster CCTV and the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing next year will be seen by 800 million within China alone. There are more mobile phone users than in Britain, America and Germany combined, and 35 million of them followed the last football World Cup via mobile news updates. Basketball, the world&apos;s second most popular team sport after football, is booming, and an estimated 300 million Chinese play it. While India hopes for a footballer to make his name in Europe, China already has a global hero in basketball, the 7ft 6in Yao Ming, who plays for the Houston Rockets. Yao Ming is the iconic figure in the NBA&apos;s push to promote the American game in China. Timothy Chen, one of China&apos;s best known business executives, has just become chief executive of the new Chinese subsidiary, NBA China. He was Microsoft&apos;s top man in China until he resigned last month. As well as negotiating new deals for TV and internet rights, he will work on the possibility of launching a new, NBA-branded league. &apos;We believe the potential of a market with four times the population of the United States ultimately must be at least what the United States is,&apos; says Adam Silver, the NBA&apos;s deputy commissioner. Asian money is also behind a radical plan in boxing. The new president of the governing body of amateur boxing (AIBA), Ching-Kuo Wu, of Taiwan, wants to set up a world league. Amateurs would move on from Olympic glory straight into the professional league, cutting out the promoters. Tom Virgets, chairman of USA Boxing, says, &apos;We are talking about an investment of $200m to $300m... to make this happen.&apos; The Asians are confident they can find the backers. For now, though, despite all the potential in Asia, America dominates. &apos;The sports industry in the US is $300billion and growing,&apos; says Miami Dolphins&apos; Joe Bailey. Money from NBC still props up the Olympics. The network has paid $2.2bn for the 2010 and 2012 Games, around two-thirds of the IOC&apos;s TV income, despite evidence that the audience is ageing and, according to Dyke, declining. The big team sports appear to have the edge over the Olympics. Today, Miami Dolphins supporters have a taste of globalisation, and it has not gone down well. Dolphins season-ticket holders have only eight home games a season and many lament the loss of this weekend&apos;s prime fixture. &apos;It&apos;s bullshit!&apos; wrote one of many irate Dolphins bloggers in Florida. &apos;It&apos;s all about more dollars for the owners and the NFL.&apos; Others are so outraged at the game being switched to London that they have started a petition to have Goodell sacked as NFL commissioner. &apos;Many fans are upset about the proposed outsourcing of American football games in general,&apos; says a statement on Miami fans&apos; anti-globalisation, anti-Goodell website. &apos;We welcome all [fans] who are opposed to outsourcing of any major league sporting events to join us.&apos; Those are views with which British sport fans might soon empathise.

The EU&apos;s trade deficit with China is on course to overtake that of the US this year. Mr Mandelson, who has repeatedly warned China it must take more urgent action to curb its subsidised exports and open its own markets, has expressed great sympathy for the Eurofer complaints in recent weeks. However, he has been warned by his advisers that bringing in curbs on steel imports from China could seriously damage steel users in the EU such as the auto industry and European investment opportunities in China. &quot;I have indicated already to steel producers that on the face of it they have a case for opening such an investigation, but I can&apos;t say at this stage what conclusion it will reach,&quot; Mr Mandelson said late last week. Eurofer said exports of Chinese steel products have inundated the EU market, with exports soaring by 3,300% over the last four years. &quot;We believe there is prima facie evidence of dumping and if the imports continue unabated they will undoubtedly cause serious injury to European producers,&quot; said Ian Rodgers, director of UK Steel, the British steel industry trade association. Eurofer said the huge volumes had swamped the EU market, undercutting domestic prices by up to 25%. This has cost European steel producers a significant share of the market &quot;leading to important under-utilization of capacity \u2013 something that seriously impacts current and future profitability of the sector and puts thousands of European jobs at stake,&quot; it said. The steel sector employs 372,000 people in the EU. &quot;The root cause of this dramatic evolution is the economically irrational growth of Chinese steel capacities which are increasingly outpacing the growth of domestic steel consumption and are driven by pervasive state intervention. This, combined with increasing fragmentation within the Chinese steel industry, has led to a worsening supply-demand imbalance,&quot; Eurofer claimed, putting the blame on the Chinese government. &quot;This imbalance has driven excess steel production out of the Chinese domestic market - and it has targeted the EU market in particular. Chinese steel producers have no genuine cost advantage over the European producers. Their export surge is based on excessive capacity development fuelled by subsidisation,&quot; it added. Eurofer said anti-dumping measures would not close the EU market as fairly-traded exports from the countries concerned as well as from other countries would continue to flow freely to Europe, ensuring a continuation of supply to steel distributers and users. A Chinese official denied that his country was exporting steel at unfairly low prices. &quot;They say we sell too cheaply, but I don&apos;t know what they mean by that,&quot; said Qi Xiangdong, vice secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Association, an industry body that represents the largest steelmakers and helps set policy.

It was certainly as carefully stage-managed. Mao was old and sick and slurred his words, but the iconic moment when he shook Nixon&apos;s hand was captured on camera. Although Nixon was thwarted in his desire to discuss Taiwan and Vietnam (Mao preferred abstract philosophy), his bold gesture did the trick of discomfiting the Soviet Union. The two leaders chatted for just over an hour, although, as MacMillan admits, the meeting was &quot;curiously inconclusive&quot;. That might appear to undermine her claim that it was one of the most important events in modern history, but in fact it is the very weirdness of the encounter that makes it significant and she reminds us of the wildly differing worldviews not only of Nixon and Mao but of China and the United States.

There are vivid descriptions of the landscape (&quot;Crimea, whose beauty provokes almost sexual yearnings of possession in all its visitors&quot;) and wherever he is, he is never far from a literary connection, be it Ovid and Osip Mandelstam, separated by many centuries but united by their Tristia, or the moving life story of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. First published in 1995, Black Sea has a new introduction noting that the region&apos;s valuable oil and gas reserves have raised its strategic importance, while a new epilogue optimistically sees signs of recovery in the marine life of its polluted rivers. IP Play Money, Or, How I Quit My Day Job and Made Millions Trading Virtual Loot, by Julian Dibbell (Basic Books, \u00a39.99) On Tuesday March 11 2003, Julian Dibbell announced to his family, his friends, and to the world at large via his website, that he was going to start a business selling imaginary suits of armour for real money and that he was going to get rich doing it. This riveting account chronicles the extraordinary year he spent trying to earn his living buying and selling virtual artefacts. There are no made-up characters in his narrative - it depends for its substance on what real people have really done and really said - yet it is a more spellbinding read than most novels. His quixotic journey, while worthy of science fiction, was &quot;not simply a diversion from the path of life; it was the path itself, for a time, and just as fraught with existential care as that path ever is&quot;. Filled with genuine ethical dilemmas and questions about virtual sweatshops and economic justice, Play Money probes the ever more hazy line between gameworld and society, giving a fascinating insight into the peculiar promise of the technologies that increasingly shape the culture we are building, as production melts into play.Aimee Shalan London, City of Disappearances, edited by Iain Sinclair (Penguin, \u00a314.99) &quot;For the bookish, London is a book. For criminals, a map of opportunities. For unpapered immigrants, it is a nest of skinned eyes, sanctioned gunmen ready to blow your head off as you run for a train.&quot; This shady companion to London pays homage to &quot;the tremble that lies beneath the confident fabric of long-established cities&quot;, and the multiplicity of that which is no longer there. It gives voice to the districts, discriminations, pleasures and perversities of the metropolis and the submerged history of the almost forgotten. Iain Sinclair solicited contributors to his &quot;anthology of absence&quot; in the hope that the city would begin to write itself, and it became something of a &quot;deflected autobiography&quot; as friends of friends sent him the missing chapters of a work he was &quot;incapable of writing&quot;. This is not the sort of book that should be read from beginning to end. As with walking the streets of London, steering a route through its pages is most enjoyable when you arrive somewhere unexpected, take a detour and give up minding whether or not you actually get to the spot you had hoped to reach. AS Passionate Minds: The Great Scientific Affair, by David Bodanis (Abacus, \u00a39.99) Voltaire and \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet were on-off lovers between 1733 and \u00c9milie&apos;s death in childbirth in 1749, and set up a prototype of a modern lab in a chateau where they carried out experiments together. Bogdanis - whose Electric Universe won the Aventis Prize for science writing - makes the eyebrow-raising claim that \u00c9milie was &quot;intellectually superior&quot; to her polymathic sugar daddy; but he seems on more solid ground in crediting her with a crucial advance in physics through a reading of Newton that introduced the notion of energy (&quot;the &apos;squared&apos; in Einstein&apos;s famous equation E=mc2 came directly from her work&quot;). He quotes brilliantly from the couple&apos;s letters and adroitly uses novelistic techniques to recount their adventures, which are reminiscent of an Alexandre Dumas thriller - duels, spells in jail, exile in England and cat-and-mouse games with the authorities for him, flings with other lovers for her. All that mars an excellent double biography is a preface that &quot;sells&quot; their story as if pitching it to a publisher or movie producer, spoiling the highlights of the narrative that follows by revealing them at the outset.John Dugdale"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/04/useconomy.us1", "publicationDate": "2007-11-04T23:43:30Z", "tags": ["Business", "US economy"], "sentences": ["&apos;We source some of our components from the Far East; but then we sell to China, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia."], "title": "Inside story: Battle-hardened UK firms fight on", "article": "Hidden on a thousand industrial estates, Britain&apos;s metal-bashers and widget-makers lack the glamour of the global finance industry or the services sector; but, as the credit crunch tightens its grip on unsuspecting borrowers, a neglected army of small businesses may be coming into its own. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the long-suffering manufacturing sector in the past year or so has been its silence. Just a few years ago, every rise in interest rates, every increase in the value of sterling, every jump in the oil price, was greeted with howls of indignation and dire warnings about job losses. Today, interest rates are close to 6 per cent, sterling has hit a 26-year high against the dollar, and the oil price is rocketing towards $100 a barrel - yet industry has uttered barely a whimper. Economists call this &apos;survivor bias&apos;: after a decade of buffeting from the strong pound and cut-price Asian competition, the weakest manufacturers have been eliminated in a long war of attrition. Those left behind are the most adaptable and innovative, and the least exposed to cheap competition. They have heeded the pleas of business leaders and politicians to confront globalisation by &apos;moving up the value chain&apos; into high-spec, niche products. Their markets are often worldwide and they source parts and other resources from all over the world, too, helping to cushion the blow from rising raw materials prices. Speak to a 21st-century manufacturer, and you&apos;re more likely to hear about lean processes, green technology and how to break into the Indian market than about the burden of rising interest rates. &apos;Up to now, the strength of the world economy has helped; so has the shift away from more price-sensitive goods, and the fact that companies are much more sophisticated in the way they source components and spread costs,&apos; says Martin Temple, director general of the Engineering Employers Federation. This hard-won robustness should stand small firms in good stead in a slowdown - and could prove to be vital for insulating Britain&apos;s economy from the full impact of tightening credit conditions, as banks reassess their lending policies in the light of the US defaults. Britain&apos;s consumers are up to their eyeballs in debt. Repayments as a proportion of take-home pay are not far off the peak of the late 1980s, and what the Bank of England calls a &apos;vulnerable tail&apos; of consumers are prey to a lending squeeze. At the same time, the flood of financial losses and lay-offs on Wall Street has underlined the fact that the good times are over for the high-stakes gamblers of the financial sector. As a result, old-fashioned businesses, many with healthy balance sheets and orders from across the world, may find themselves picking up the baton. Manufacturing makes up just 14 per cent of the economy these days, but it may be better at surviving a downturn than in the past. Employers&apos; groups are not picking up distress signals from their members as yet - or calling for a cut in interest rates. &apos;Generally, companies are still reporting fairly healthy order books,&apos; says Temple. &apos;I think there is a fairly good sentiment; I&apos;m not sensing a collapse,&apos; agrees David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce. &apos;Manufacturing is doing better than the services sector.&apos; Like many observers, he is hoping that strong demand from fast-growing economies such as China will help to offset both the looming slowdown in America and the arrival of cheaper US goods as the dollar declines. &apos;You have this immense power, China, and on the back of that, British businesses are benefiting,&apos; he says. &apos;You don&apos;t have the global slowdown that we would have seen in the past. [Then] all eyes would have been on the US, but now you&apos;ve got China as a truly global player.&apos; However, Frost admits that, after years of neglect, Britain&apos;s hard core of manufacturers is much diminished. &apos;We have not been as well placed as Germany: if you look at Germany&apos;s performance, it&apos;s been leaving us very much in its wake.&apos; He is also concerned about the government&apos;s approach to supporting small and medium-sized companies - &apos;the backbone of the economy&apos;. Big corporate beasts, including Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson and Tesco boss Sir Terry Leahy, had their chance to buttonhole Gordon Brown at his glitzy Business Council for Britain meeting in Downing Street last month. But as the continuing furore over Chancellor Alistair Darling&apos;s changes to capital gains tax in his first pre-Budget report shows, smaller firms, many of them privately owned, feel their voices are rarely heard when policies are drawn up. After the changes announced in Brown&apos;s valedictory Budget in March, which abolished the zero corporation tax rate for the smallest businesses to fund a cut in the main rate, some small entrepreneurs took the CGT announcement as confirmation that the government is willing to hit smaller businesses while protecting corporate giants. &apos;Unquestionably, small businesses feel they&apos;re being clobbered harder than anybody else,&apos; says Frost. &apos;They don&apos;t see any sense that their role in society is valued, in creating wealth and creating jobs.&apos; &apos;This wasn&apos;t signalled,&apos; says Temple of the CGT change. &apos;There was no consultation. We just think it&apos;s not the way to go about policy.&apos; Relations with Whitehall may deteriorate even further if the new-found resilience of Britain&apos;s small manufacturers is tested again in the months ahead. There are early signs of trouble. The closely watched manufacturing purchasing managers&apos; index, which gauges confidence among firms in the sector, dropped sharply in October to 52.9, its lowest reading since December 2006. &apos;The rampant pound, record oil prices and mounting economic uncertainty are all taking their toll on UK business sentiment,&apos; says David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns. As consumers adjust to a chillier world of higher interest rates, he says the performance of the corporate sector could become vital. &apos;If they start to scale back to weather an expected downturn next year, it will intensify the slowdown effect.&apos; City boys with bonus cheques may be more exciting, but as they batten down the hatches in the Square Mile, the dynamism of good old-fashioned boring exporters could provide an important source of support. And if, as some analysts are already predicting, sterling is heading for a sharp correction, exporters could be among the few winners as the economy slows. Case studies: &apos;Losers haven&apos;t adapted&apos; &apos;There&apos;s nowhere to hide in business these days,&apos; says Andrew Smith, head of manufacturing at Numatic, the firm that sells &apos;Henry&apos; vacuum cleaners. &apos;There are pressures from all directions. There are winners and losers, and the losers are the ones that haven&apos;t adapted.&apos; Numatic has responded to rising competition by developing new products and seeking new markets for its squat red-and-black cleaners all over the world. &apos;We source some of our components from the Far East; but then we sell to China, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia. We export all over the world. At the moment, we are busier than we have ever been.&apos; Smith believes even if a slowdown is on the way, Numatic will ride it out. &apos;People need to clean, like they need to eat. &apos; He&apos;s not worried about rising interest rates but does admit that government red tape is a growing irritation. Smith was also disappointed by the changes to capital gains tax announced in the pre-budget report last month. &apos;Everyone thinks it was appalling the way it was introduced: it&apos;s hit lots of people.&apos; Gerry Brame is the managing director of Powrmatic, which employs 250 staff making heating systems in Ilminster, Somerset. For him, the busy winter period is just beginning, and so far, it looks good. &apos;We have seen a relatively buoyant start to our season: much better than the past two years.&apos; Brame says he has to innovate to survive. He has a masters degree in &apos;lean manufacturing&apos;, helping him to slim down the production process, and restructure. &apos;We have some extremely good products, that will enable us to stay ahead of the competition. We have got to stay awake - everybody has.&apos; He also hopes to capitalise on the &apos;green wave&apos;, by selling carbon-neutral domestic heating products, initially to overseas buyers. The strength of sterling makes Powrmatic&apos;s products more expensive, especially in the US, but the pound&apos;s greater buying power is helpful in paying for imported raw materials. So far, there has been little fallout from the credit crunch. &apos;We don&apos;t sell to many domestic users, so we missed all that.&apos; As commercial director of Fracino, a Birmingham-based company making coffee machines, Angela Maxwell relies on happy consumers. &apos;Doom and gloom messages are not particularly helpful. We supply to what&apos;s ostensibly the leisure market: restaurants, bars, cafes: it&apos;s sort of a luxury item.&apos; Most of Fracino&apos;s business is in the UK, but it also sells to emerging markets, including Thailand and India. Maxwell doesn&apos;t have too many complaints about the government&apos;s attitude to small business. &apos;The Thatcher government said it was the voice of business, but wasn&apos;t in my view.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/08/investing.japan", "publicationDate": "2007-11-08T19:26:18Z", "tags": ["Business", "Investing", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The prospects are better in Taiwan and Korea, and even China is now a possibility.&quot;"], "title": "Wages of sin", "article": "Ambitious plans by a chain of Japanese &quot;love hotels&quot; to float on London&apos;s Alternative Investments Market [Aim] have raised hopes that the multibillion dollar industry will gain the respectability it craves through fresh international investment. Japan Leisure Hotels [JLH], which owns five love hotels under the Bonita name valued at about \u00a321ms, intends to raise up to \u00a3100m through the flotation to acquire new properties. The move is a further sign that Japan&apos;s lucrative love hotel industry is cleaning up its act in search of market legitimacy. Despite its size and promises of healthy dividends, the sector has traditionally been kept at arm&apos;s length by Japanese institutional investors, wary of being associated with an industry that depends wholly on the carnal needs of its clientele. From huge, neon-lit faux castles located at busy motorway intersections to shabby concrete boxes in city backstreets, love hotels offer a dizzying array of rooms and esoteric extras for couples looking to add novelty value to their love life or simply spend time away from their cramped apartments. Their neon signboards are easy to spot in any big town or city, their names as kitsch as their interiors: Hotel Passion, Hotel for You, Caribbean Resort. An estimated 2 million Japanese visit a love hotel every day, with some rooms used as many as four times daily. With their impressive occupancy rates and relatively low operating and start-up costs, Japan&apos;s love hotel industry generates annual sales worth more than the entire UK hotel industry. &quot;Although there are no official data, if you do the sums you come up with a figure of about 4 trillion yen,&quot; an industry insider told Guardian Unlimited. &quot;There are not that many costs involved, so the a big proportion of the profits goes to the government in tax.&quot; Guests can choose from among an estimated 28,000 love hotels, which charge modest rates from a few thousand yen for a &quot;rest&quot; of several hours to two or three times as much for an overnight stay. Innocent human interaction is kept to a minimum to spare the blushes of the guests, who often include those having extramarital affairs. Guests select their room from an illuminated display in the lobby with the push of a button. Cash transactions can be completed by machine or via a booth designed to allow guests and receptionist to avoid eye contact. The rooms in up-market &quot;leisure hotels&apos;&quot;are tastefully furnished and look little different from regular business hotels. Others that are less ambiguous about their purpose are controlled by the national police agency.  Typically, they do not have lobbies or restaurants and, according to the adult entertainment business law, include &quot;facilities and equipment,&quot; such as mirrored ceilings and video cameras &quot;able to film reclining individuals&quot;. Many of the 8,000 seedier hotels are gradually being replaced by more respectable establishments thanks to a 1985 law that bans the construction of new hotels with an overtly sexual theme. These days, any newly built or refurbished hotel is more likely have karaoke machines and wide-screen TVs than revolving beds and fur-lined handcuffs. With a couple of exceptions, Japanese banks are reluctant to lend to love hotels because of their associations with organised crime ... and sex. Family run businesses Yet the potential financial benefits to investors are difficult to ignore. Operating costs are significantly lower than those of regular hotels, and the infrastructure is in place in the form of thousands of existing properties. In recent years the sector has attracted interest from individual investors. Earlier this year the Tokyo-based investment group Global Financial Support [GFS] launched the last of its 11 love hotel funds. It had already raised a total of \u00a511.6bn (\u00a349.3m) since 2004, with average payouts of 8.4% annual interest compared with less than 1% on ordinary Japanese savings accounts. The investments are not fully guaranteed, meaning investors can lose out if the hotels go out of business, but the prospect of high returns has generated huge interest in the funds. GFS, whose properties include the exotically themed Hotel Asia P-Door in central Tokyo, said the traditional image of love hotels was outdated. &quot;There is a strong bias in Japan that these love hotels are a part of the underworld, but we have learned that most of them are family-run businesses so these funds are very sound investments,&quot; GFS chief executive Shuzo Shinano said at the fund&apos;s launch. Aim would appear to be an ideal launching pad for the industry&apos;s latest drive for respectability. The market, a lightly regulated offshoot of the London Stock Exchange, welcomes the presence of growing companies or those from non-mainstream sectors. But it came under fire earlier this year when Roel Campos, a commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission, likened it to a gambling den. &quot;I&apos;m concerned that 30% of insurers that list on Aim are gone in a year,&quot; he said. &quot;That feels like a casino to me and I believe investors will treat it as such.&quot; His comments drew an angry response from the LSE, which pointed out that fewer than 2% of companies listed on Aim fail within a year. Steve Mansfield, a proposed director of JLH, was confident the firm had made the right move. &quot;Our experience of dealing with leisure hotels in Japan has proved that this is a market with numerous opportunities to create value and establish a strongly cash-generative portfolio. &quot;By creating a group of leading leisure hotels throughout Japan we believe we can deliver excellent returns to our shareholders, while growing the capital value of our portfolio.&quot; The group hopes to take advantage of the difficulty some love hotel owners face in selling on properties, as well as the lack of capital from domestic banks. &quot;If it works out for Japan leisure Hotels then it makes it easier for the rest of us,&quot; said the industry source, whose firm is about to add a third love hotel to its portfolio. He added, however, that the flotation was unlikely to lead to the creation of a British love hotel industry. &quot;We all dream of making money and investing it back home, but I don&apos;t think the culture is ready for that in places like Britain and Australia. The prospects are better in Taiwan and Korea, and even China is now a possibility.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/10/5", "publicationDate": "2007-11-10T23:45:53Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["I Don&apos;t Want To Sleep Alone/The Wayward Cloud Two recent films by Taiwan&apos;s Tsai Ming-Liang."], "title": "In cinemas this weekend", "article": "A Crude Awakening (12A)(Basil Gelpke, Ray McCormack, 2006, US) 85 mins.

The de facto independence of the island, viewed by Beijing as a renegade province, depends in the last resort on US defensive guarantees and arms supplies. Yet despite expanded collaboration with Washington in other areas, China remains engaged in a rapid military build-up along the Taiwan Strait. According to Taiwan&apos;s president, Chen Shui-ban, China now has 988 missiles aimed at Taiwanese targets and is continually adding to its arsenal. Chen, who strongly opposes unification and Beijing&apos;s &quot;one China&quot; mantra, recently described China as a threat to regional peace and said it was preparing to take the island by force by 2015. Last month, China said it had deployed a high-performance radar system designed to complement its surface-to-air missiles and jet fighter interceptors. Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, questioned the build-up, which China describes as modernisation, during a visit to Beijing last week. The two sides agreed to create a military hotline to help defuse future crises. But Gates&apos;s overriding stated priority was securing China&apos;s backing for steps to curb Iran&apos;s nuclear activities - and stemming the sale of Chinese arms to Tehran that end up in the hands of Iraqi and Afghan insurgents. On Taiwan, he merely reiterated Washington&apos;s formulaic support for maintaining the status quo. While the US frequently encourages Taiwan to buy new and second-hand US weaponry to be better able to defend itself, it has criticised Taipei&apos;s indigenous development of the long-range &quot;Hsiung Feng&apos; cruise missile, which it (and China) views as an offensive weapon. Chen was recently obliged to pledge to &quot;consult&quot; Washington before firing the missiles. US fears about fuelling cross-strait tensions, stoked by Beijing, also appear to have delayed Taiwan&apos;s purchase of 66 state-of-the-art, US-made F16 fighters. Taiwanese officials say China has become adept at manipulating the Bush administration. &quot;They are under pressure from China. China is very clever. If they want to do something on Taiwan, they call the White House and tell the Americans that Taiwan is rocking the boat. Then the US government puts pressure on us,&quot; a senior official said. &quot;We tell the Americans they should deal directly with us, they should take our national interest into consideration. But of course we are afraid about the growing cooperation between the US and China. It is a problem for us. It is definitely squeezing Taiwan.&quot; Political factors are also straining Taipei-Washington ties as Taiwan moves towards next year&apos;s contentious legislative and presidential elections, in January and March respectively. Chen, who is standing down after two terms, is determined to hold a national referendum before he goes on changing the country&apos;s official name - Republic of China - to the more familiar Taiwan. The plan is then to apply for UN membership (it is currently excluded) under the new name - thereby raising &quot;global awareness&quot; of the Taiwan issue. Poll watchers say the referendum proposal, opposed by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) but backed the ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) and 3 million signatures, is likely to pass as matters stand now. That prospect infuriates China, which rightly sees the vote as a ploy to emphasise Taiwan&apos;s separateness, and alarms the risk-averse US. &quot;The referendum is unnecessary and unhelpful,&quot; Stephen Young, Washington&apos;s unofficial &quot;ambassador&quot; to Taipei, said last week. Although the US would not impose sanctions &quot;there will be a price to pay in mutual trust&quot;, he added. Chen justified the name-change plan. &quot;The UN referendum is saying &apos;no&apos; to China&apos;s threat ... It is not a referendum that moves towards independence but one that rejects unification.&quot; To shared consternation in Washington and Beijing, Taiwan&apos;s future relations with the mainland are emerging as the key election issue, ahead of economic and welfare issues. While the DPP&apos;s presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, generally favours measures to strengthen Taiwan&apos;s separate identity, Ma Ying-jeou, his KMT rival, says he would seek a peace treaty with China and deepen investment, trade and transport links. For his pains, Ma has been accused of lack of patriotism. In a sign of how deep political divisions run, Taiwan and China have even fallen out over next year&apos;s Beijing Olympics. Months of wrangling over the route of the Olympic torch relay ended in stalemate in September, and it will not now pass through Taiwan. Instead the DPP launched its own torch processions, highlighting both the UN membership bid - and the bitter gulf between the two sides."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/14/foodanddrink", "publicationDate": "2007-11-14T09:06:06Z", "tags": ["Film", "Food & drink", "Life and style", "Culture"], "sentences": ["And in Ang Lee&apos;s Taiwan-set Eat Drink Man Woman, virtually the entire plot unfolds over a series of Sundays around the three sisters&apos; dinner table."], "title": "Meals on reels", "article": "What is the most famous food scene in all cinema? Could it be Samuel L Jackson interrogating the men he&apos;s been hired to kill about European hamburgers and the metric system in Pulp Fiction? Or might it be Debbie Reynolds jumping out of a cake to do the charleston in Singin&apos; in the Rain? Hannibal Lecter&apos;s serving suggestion for human liver in The Silence of the Lambs is among Hollywood&apos;s best-remembered lines, while dedicated foodies might plump for any of the scenes celebrating food connoisseurship or gluttony in Babette&apos;s Feast or La Grande Bouffe. Ever since I learned as a teenager that the blood spiralling down the plughole in the shower scene from Psycho was actually chocolate sauce, I&apos;ve been intrigued by the way food is portrayed on screen. The moment you start keeping an eye out for what characters are eating and why, you begin to notice the myriad different uses to which directors put food in their films. In Taxi Driver and Annie Hall, for example, the characters&apos; eating habits provide a helpful shorthand way to sketch in their particular quirks. It is when we see maladjusted cabbie Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) making a bizarre order of apple pie topped with melted cheese that we first get an inkling that he might not be quite right in the head. Similarly, through watching Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) chasing wayward lobsters around a Long Island kitchen with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), the audience sees instantly how perfectly matched the neurotic lovers are, both highly strung, but with a gleeful enjoyment of their own absurdity. And in Ang Lee&apos;s Taiwan-set Eat Drink Man Woman, virtually the entire plot unfolds over a series of Sundays around the three sisters&apos; dinner table. Eating also crops up regularly as a metaphor for sexual appetite, or for simple relish of life itself. For example, previously prim Sally Albright&apos;s (Meg Ryan) operatically faked orgasm over a rather ordinary-looking pastrami sandwich in When Harry Met Sally hints that she might after all make a viable sexual partner for the terminally libidinous Harry (Billy Crystal). In contrast, the grindingly bland fish soup that French servant Babette (St\u00e9phane Audrane) is taught to prepare for the austere Danish sisters she works for in Babette&apos;s Feast is a poignant example of how their lives have gradually become dead to pleasure. Sometimes, screenplays go a step further and make food an essential cog propelling the plot&apos;s motor forward. The Satanist neighbours&apos; plan to make Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) bed down with Beelzebub to spawn the new antichrist in Rosemary&apos;s Baby wouldn&apos;t have come to much without the sleeping pill-laced chocolate mousse her complicit husband pressures her into eating. Likewise, gazpacho - laced yet again with sleeping pills - is an essential component of the mayhem caused by cracked actress Pepa (Carmen Maura), when her lover dumps her in Almod\u00f3var&apos;s Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. And in Peter Greenaway&apos;s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, the wife has her murdered lover roasted whole to perfection - crispy skin and all - before force-feeding him to her gangster husband, who had ordered his killing. But while food crops up in films time and again as a plot device or metaphor, the actual business of eating is something the movies have little time for. While countless films use the dinner table as a handy means of corralling characters together, you hardly ever see an actor swallow something. You might see someone waggle a chip in the air or stab angrily at a wayward piece of lettuce for dramatic effect, but the amount of real grub going down is minimal. While this makes dramatic sense - I&apos;d rather watch Humphrey Bogart talking than chewing - if we all ate as little as film characters appear to, we&apos;d end up looking as willowy and undernourished as your average starlet. Perhaps this is not surprising: on close inspection, many aspects of celluloid food display as skewed a take on real eating as Hitchcock&apos;s chocolate sauce. Take Hannibal Lecter&apos;s aforementioned claim to have eaten a census-taker&apos;s liver &quot;with fava beans and a nice chianti&quot;. Surely an entire liver would be far too queasily rich for a single person, even a cannibalistic psychopath with a healthy appetite. And if you were really determined to eat human liver, wouldn&apos;t you make sure your victim refrained from smoking and drinking for at least a month before tucking in? The same could be said of Harry Hill&apos;s (Ray Liotta) assertion in Goodfellas that, when doing time, Paulie made up for the prison&apos;s lack of a crusher by slicing garlic with a razor blade so thinly that it liquefied in the pan. I dare say that if I was a wafer-thin slice of garlic, I&apos;d liquefy in oil if a Mafia heavy persuaded me it was in my best interests to do so, but in real life, I have never found that razor-slashed garlic melts the way that Harry claims (though this time-consuming method still provides a deliciously delicate result). But while some films aren&apos;t necessarily a source of the soundest cooking tips, many still contain fantastic portrayals of food, with scenes so magical that they make you want to run straight to the kitchen. My personal (rather obscure) favourite is fairytale princess Catherine Deneuve singing a recipe for an enchanted love cake while disguised as a mud-caked ass in Jacques Demy&apos;s musical fable Donkey Skin. Not only is the sight of the famous beauty slipping from her pelt into a golden ball gown while singing about eggs and yeast one of cinema&apos;s most playfully bizarre scenes, but for once the simple recipe described actually works.  \u00b7 Pulp Kitchen by Feargus O&apos;Sullivan is published by Pan Macmillan, price \u00a39.99.

In mainland China, where unauthorised translations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows surfaced on websites ahead of its official release last month, publishers also said they were taking strict measures to curb piracy.  Mainland China&apos;s the People&apos;s Literature Publishing House said it had issued 1.1m copies of the book, the seventh in the Harry Potter series, but declined to provide sales figures.  Taiwan&apos;s Crown Culture Corp has shipped 700,000 copies to bookshops in Taiwan and Hong Kong, a figure that already exceeds the company&apos;s total print run of 680,000 for the sixth and penultimate Harry Potter book, marketing executive Icy Lee said.  Lee also refused to offer sales figures, although both publishing companies said further printings were possible.  In China, which has long been the world&apos;s leading source of illegally copied goods, including designer clothes, movies and music, the People&apos;s Literature Publishing House marketing executive Sun Shunlin said its new Potter books are printed with anti-piracy watermarks on the first page.  China&apos;s General Administration of Press and Publication has also ordered officials to get tough on book pirates, he said.  &quot;The piracy situation for the seventh Harry Potter book isn&apos;t severe. I can&apos;t say there aren&apos;t any pirated copies out there at all, but very few copies are found on the streets,&quot; Sun said.  The General Administration of Press and Publication didn&apos;t immediately respond to faxed questions about piracy of the book.  Sun said every new Harry Potter edition has sold about 1.6m copies in mainland China, with the fifth book selling slightly fewer copies, and that he expects the final book to post similar sales results. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, Crown Culture Corp&apos;s print runs have ranged from 680,000 copies for the sixth book to nearly 1.1m for the first.  The latest book about the magical antics of Harry Potter and his friends sells for a pricey 66 Chinese yuan (\u00a34.30) in China, where the average worker makes as little as 500 yuan (\u00a332.50) a month, Sun said. The first six books cost 60 yuan (\u00a33.90) or less.  In Taiwan and Hong Kong, the Chinese version of the final Potter tome costs US$19 (\u00a319). The list price for the English-language book is US$35 (\u00a316.90) on Amazon.com.

The de facto independence of Taiwan, viewed by Beijing as a renegade province, depends in the last resort on American defensive guarantees and arms supplies. Yet despite expanded collaboration with Washington in other areas, China remains engaged in a rapid military build-up along the Taiwan Strait. According to Taiwan&apos;s president, Chen Shui-ban, China now has 988 missiles aimed at Taiwanese targets and is continually adding to its arsenal. Chen, who strongly opposes unification and the communists&apos; &quot;one China&quot; mantra, recently described Beijing as a threat to regional peace and said it was preparing to take the island by force by 2015. Last month China said it had deployed a high-performance radar system designed to complement its surface-to-air missiles and jet fighter interceptors. Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, questioned the build-up during a visit to Beijing last week. The two sides agreed to create a military hotline to help defuse crises. But Gates&apos; overriding stated priority was securing China&apos;s backing for steps to curb Iran&apos;s nuclear activities. On Taiwan, he merely reiterated Washington&apos;s formulaic support for maintaining the status quo. While the US frequently encourages Taiwan to buy new and secondhand American weaponry, to be better able to defend itself, it has criticised Taipei&apos;s indigenous development of the long-range Hsiung Feng cruise missile, which it, and China, view as an offensive weapon. Chen was recently obliged to pledge to &quot;consult&quot; Washington before firing the missiles. US fears about fuelling cross-strait tensions, stoked by Beijing, also appear to have delayed Taiwan&apos;s purchase of 66 state-of-the-art, US-made F16 fighters. Taiwanese officials say China has become adept at manipulating the Bush administration. &quot;They are under pressure from China. China is very clever. If they want to do something on Taiwan, they call the White House and tell the Americans that Taiwan is rocking the boat. Then the US government puts pressure on us,&quot; a senior official said. &quot;Of course we are afraid about the growing cooperation between the US and China. It&apos;s a problem for us. It is definitely squeezing Taiwan.&quot; Political factors are also straining Taipei-Washington ties as Taiwan moves towards next year&apos;s contentious legislative and presidential elections, in January and March respectively. Chen, who is standing down after two terms, is determined to hold a national referendum before he goes on changing the country&apos;s official name - Republic of China - to the more familiar Taiwan. The plan is then to apply for UN membership. Poll watchers say the referendum proposal, opposed by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) but backed by the ruling Democratic Progressive party (DPP) and three million signatures, is likely to pass. That prospect infuriates China, which rightly sees the vote as a ploy to emphasise Taiwan&apos;s separateness, and alarms the US. To shared consternation in Washington and Beijing, relations between Taiwan and the mainland are emerging as the key election issue. While the DPP&apos;s presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, generally favours measures to strengthen Taiwan&apos;s separate identity, Ma Ying-jeou, his KMT rival, says he would seek a peace treaty with China and deepen investment, trade and transport links. For his pains Ma has been accused of lack of patriotism. In a sign of how deep the political divisions run, Taiwan and China have even fallen out over next year&apos;s Beijing Olympics. Following an enormous row, the Olympic torch relay will not now pass through Taiwan. Instead the DPP launched its own torch processions, highlighting both the UN bid - and the bitter gulf between the two sides."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/15/morethantwomillenniaafter", "publicationDate": "2007-11-15T16:30:07Z", "tags": ["China", "Museums", "Culture", "Art and design", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Steve Tsang drew attention to the way China has accepted foreign rulers in dynasties such as the Qing and drew a contrast between Taiwan where Chiang Kai-shek sought to operate a Confucian model after 1949 while the mainland was run under an ideology imported from Europe."], "title": "Continuity and change", "article": "More than two millennia after he failed in his bid for immortality, the first emperor of China remains a deeply controversial figure: the heroic founding father of the world&apos;s oldest continuous civilisation and a political system that endured down the centuries, or a heartless despot set only on imposing himself and turning his realm into a slave state? Or both? And then there is the secondary, contemporary question - how far is China still run on lines he set down in 221BC, and, if so, can that survive in a globalised world with the rise of the internet and huge economic and social changes in the People&apos;s Republic? The variety of opinions such questions arouse was on display last night at a debate organised by the Guardian and the British Museum in connection with the sell-out exhibition on the First Emperor and the Terracotta Warriors at the museum (listen to the full debate here). Here we lay out the views expressed then, and invite you to add yours in this confrontation of China old and new - or old-new? The widely accepted view of Qin Shi Huangdi, who established his empire in 221BC after defeating other warring states in northern China, is that he was (in the title of a television documentary about him) &quot;The Man who made China&quot;. His legacy of unity, despotism and the building of a centralised state is taken as a template for the way the nation is ruled, not only under the empire that lasted till 1912 but also in the communist regime which has held sway since 1949. But what is the reality of the first emperor&apos;s legacy? The core question is whether the template set more than two millennia ago still applies in a world in which the People&apos;s Republic has become a central player in globalisation, open to outside influences however much the party seeks to control them. In that context, will individualism be allowed to express itself otherwise than in making money, or will the leadership in Beijing try to perpetuate the top-down conformity demanded by the founder of the Qin empire? One panellist, the author Sun Shuyun, recalled an early sign of individual initiative in the most sensitive of places in China - Tiananmen Square. In 1984, she and her classmates had been drilled for hour after hour to frogmarch past Deng Xiaoping chanting slogans wishing him a long life. But, in the event, they simply shouted &quot;Hello Deng&quot;. For her today, the Chinese people have shown so emphatically what they have been able to achieve economically, that it is time for the country&apos;s rulers to loosen their grip and allow wider freedoms. Venture capitalist and blogger Isaac Mao, who had flown from Shanghai for the debate, noted how the framework of censorship that surrounds him had shaped his mind - when he got to London he expected websites he accessed to be blocked as they would have been in the People&apos;s Republic. He noted the explosion in the number of Chinese bloggers, now reaching 14 million. The process, he thought, was unstoppable. China had entered a new phase not only because of the economic growth of the last three decades, but also through the influence of communications such as the internet. Social networks enabled people to exchange ideas; the internet had hit the traditional top-down system. Professor Steven Tsang from Oxford and I went back into history. I outlined facets of Chinese governance that stretched down the centuries from the foundation of the Qin empire. Steve Tsang noted how the man who ordered the Terracotta Warriors to be made to guard him in the afterlife had proclaimed a universal empire - those inside it were civilised, those outside were barbarians. His victory over neighbouring kings ended the period of the warring states, but replaced this with &quot;gigantic slavery and use of resources which he exhausted&quot;. China was a superpower under the Qin and succeeding dynasties such as the Han, Tang, Sui and Qing, and declared itself to be good and benevolent. Today China was sincere in proclaiming its desire for a &quot;peaceful rise&quot; because it is in Beijing&apos;s interests for peace to reign. But what, he asked, would the PRC do after it had risen? I advanced the notion that new forces in China&apos;s economy and society were escaping from the control of the centre which was growing relatively weaker, while Isaac thought the best hope for progress would be a combination of &quot;wise leadership from the top&quot; and the growing education and influence of the grassroots. A well-designed system was needed to run a country like China. Society should be &quot;made more intelligent&quot;. &quot;In the 21st century,&quot; he added, &quot;China&apos;s people should have their own thought model. To cooperate with the leadership.&quot; But modernisation should not mean neglecting the cultural heritage. Focussing on the Warriors, themselves, Shu Shuyun said she did not regard them as from an alien past but as part of her that happened to have been made two millennia ago. Continuity and civilisation defined the Chinese as Chinese, she went on. Ancestors had to be venerated, as shown by the way the family name comes before the given name in China. But the country faces a major problem in the removal of welfare services from the poor, a decision, she noted, that had been made without any public debate. Steve Tsang drew attention to the way China has accepted foreign rulers in dynasties such as the Qing and drew a contrast between Taiwan where Chiang Kai-shek sought to operate a Confucian model after 1949 while the mainland was run under an ideology imported from Europe. A problem with authoritarian leaders, he added, is that they have to get things right, while democracy &quot;can accommodate idiots&quot;. After the panel debate, China&apos;s ambassador in London, Fu Ying, was invited to join in from the audience. She recalled that she had been on the podium when Shu and her classmates marched past Deng - interpreting for a foreign visitor. Though the first emperor in the school books, she doubted that Chinese today thought about him. The kind of regimentation Shu had experienced in her youth no longer existed. China scholar Elizabeth Wright said it was a mistake to think of China as a united country; rather it was a federal state. As for its global status, being a superpower was a very difficult role to play, she added. All superpowers were accused of behaving badly. To which Steve Tsang drew attention to the remaining power of the Communist party - including its authority over the military. Isaac Mao foresaw &quot;a very diversified country&quot; as no one policy could deal with the differences in contemporary society. Shu Shuyun asked why the first empire fell after only 16 years, and found the answer in the fragility of absolute rule. The country was bound to rebel given the oppression employed by the Qin founder. On the other hand, the survival of the next dynasty, the Han, for two centuries, was based on the harmonious teachings of Confucius in place of the harsh legalism of the first emperor. Returning to the issue of censorship, Isaac Mao said that, instead, the Great Firewall that drew on the old control system was totally wrong. Rather, the creativity and innovation of the Chinese people should be encouraged. I noted both the strength of regionalism and the way in which President Hu Jintao had put innovation at the top of his economic agenda for the next five years - even talking of the need for companies that could promote Chinese brands globally. The last intervention, from writer and journalist Isabel Hilton, provided a strong summation to the evening by saying that China had been trying to find a new political form since the end of the empire in 1912. To whom does the state belong? was the crucial question. The doctrine of Chinese exceptionalism, based on the ideology of the first emperor, was, she argued, an avoidance of that question, designed to postpone change.

Media agency Universal McCann has surveyed 10,000 internet users in 21 countries and found that demand for a convergent device such as the iPhone is actually pretty low, at least in developed markets like the UK. Only 41% of the 500 Britons surveyed expressed an interest in owning a converged mobile handset, on par with France and South Korea. Interest in Japan, Taiwan, the US and Germany was even lower, with only 27% of Japanese respondents expressing an interest. The interest was greatest in Mexico at 79% and similarly high in other developing markets, including Brazil and Malaysia at 72% and India at 70%. In the UK, most people already own a mobile phone and one or more of the devices that the iPhone could replace, with 24% of respondents owning five or more devices. For example, 82% of Britons own a mobile phone and 48% own an MP3 player, the research suggests. It&apos;s not that people don&apos;t want more from their mobile phones -some 48% said they would like iPod video capabilities on their mobile phone in future. However, only 43% said they wanted wireless internet capability and 28% want audio-only iPod functionality. However, demand for 3G capabilities, which are not offered by the iPhone, are far higher, topping the wish list with 50% of respondents saying they would like a 3G phone in the future. Despite the hype surrounding the iPhone there have been reports that even sales to early adopters were slower than expected. Sales in the UK over the weekend were &quot;in the tens of thousands&quot;, according to the head of Apple&apos;s mobile phone partner O2. The UK, and Europe in general, is a more sophisticated mobile market in the US and one with much higher penetration of 3G technology, which the iPhone doesn&apos;t offer. And even in the US it&apos;s questionable whether sales have matched the hype, despite the mania on launch weekend. Apple says it has sold 1.4 million iPhones since launch in July. Some industry insiders say this is not enough to make it mass market given there are 300 million people in the US - though to be fair, it took Apple two years to sell its first 1.4 million iPods. The company has forecast total sales of 10 million iPhones in calendar year 2008 but has not set targets for the Christmas retail season. The iPhone will no doubt be a successful product that makes a lot of money for Apple but it&apos;s questionable whether it warrants the masses of attention paid to it. Universal McCann&apos;s research is useful for a dose of perspective, though it&apos;s also possible the true impact of the iPhone will come not from the numbers sold, but from the influence it has on the future form and function of mobile phones. The iPhone has won plaudits for its sleek interface and ease of use, integration with iTunes, and the flat-rate tariff offered by partners AT&amp;T in the US and O2 in the UK for internet browsing. If features like this get adopted more widely, the iPhone will have served a wider purpose, whether or not it achieves critical mass itself."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/nov/18/comedy.drama", "publicationDate": "2007-11-18T23:43:48Z", "tags": ["Film", "Comedy", "Drama", "World cinema", "Culture"], "sentences": ["I Don&apos;t Want to Sleep Alone finds the malaise in Malaysia as guest workers from Bangladesh, Japan, Taiwan and China cough their way around a smog-choked Kuala Lumpur, comforting and exploiting one another."], "title": "I Don't Want to Sleep Alone", "article": "I Don&apos;t Want to Sleep Alone finds the malaise in Malaysia as guest workers from Bangladesh, Japan, Taiwan and China cough their way around a smog-choked Kuala Lumpur, comforting and exploiting one another.

Kingsley Amis, however, thought it &apos;a crass, purblind, infantile, featureless heap of gangrened elephant sputum&apos;. They were talking about the earliest major literary text in our language, the 3,182-line Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf, written in 10th-century England, set in eighth-century Denmark, and now brought to the screen by Robert Zemeckis, continuing his interest in excursions into the past (his Back to the Future trilogy) and his experiments in working between animation and live action (Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, The Polar Express). The film takes in the main incidents of the poem. The Geatish warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes from what is now southern Sweden to the Danish court of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) to defeat first the man-eating monster Grendel (Crispin Glover), then Grendel&apos;s beguiling mother (Angelina Jolie). Some years later, now himself a king, he confronts in mutually destructive combat a mighty dragon. Co-scripted by comic-strip author Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, who shared a best original screenplay Oscar with Tarantino for Pulp Fiction, the film is technically a state-of-the-art affair in the way the digitally enhanced live-action figures are inseparable from the animated backgrounds, but it belongs to the blunt end of the cinematic cutting edge as far as the acting and dialogue go. Winstone&apos;s Beowulf has been enhanced into an eight-foot giant, but you still expect him to tap Grendel&apos;s chest with his forefinger and say: &apos;You&apos;re out of fuckin&apos; order!&apos; The contrivance by which Beowulf&apos;s private parts are obscured as he strolls around Hrothgar&apos;s hall and does battle with Grendel would win him 10s from a judging panel that included Phyllis Dixey, Gypsy Rose Lee and Sally Rand. His carousing Myrmidons sing jocularly dirty songs like a gang of drunken rugby players and talk about &apos;bollocks&apos; and &apos;wankers&apos;, though when it comes to sexual matters, everyone opts for the Middle English &apos;swiving&apos;. Anthony Hopkins with his Burtonesque Dylan Thomas delivery seems always on the point of saying: &apos;Do not chase Grendel into that good night&apos;, and the naked Jolie resembles Shirley Eaton as the 24-carat fall girl who got the stick in Goldfinger. Zemeckis believes his film &apos;should stir some debate in academia&apos;, but it&apos;s all pretty laughable sword-and-sorcery stuff and could well have been called Norse by Norse Worst Literary matters less crass lie at the centre of writer-director Robin Swicord&apos;s The Jane Austen Book Club, a dramatic comedy in which middle-class Californian women form a reading group to study the novels of Jane Austen over a period of some six months. The object is to console one friend who&apos;s been deserted by her husband and another who&apos;s grieving over the loss of a pet dog. As there are six novels to be covered over six months, they need a sixth member and by chance this turns out to be a wealthy young Silicon Valley entrepreneur (Britain&apos;s Hugh Dancy), a sci-fi fan who&apos;s never read a word of Austen. It&apos;s Steel Magnolias at an Open University summer school and everything that happens in this highly contrived, self-consciously literate, self-congratulatory elitist work echoes, refers to or is inspired by Austen. It will send shibboleths running down many people&apos;s spines, but I rather enjoyed it and especially liked the ensemble performances. The ultimate message seems to be that reading is the next best thing to sex, as well as a stimulating prelude to it. Boiled down from a large literary work, though not a literary film, Sarah Gavron&apos;s Brick Lane is based on Monica Ali&apos;s prize-winning novel and resulted in an unnecessary flurry when the Bangladeshi community in the eponymous area of east London prevented it from being shot there. It&apos;s a small, touching picture about 17-year-old Nazneen (Tannishtha Chatterjee) being sent from her Bangladeshi village to marry a pompous, insensitive, self-deceiving older man in London. She bears him a son who dies, and two daughters, and much of the movie takes place in her early 30s when she&apos;s trying to break out of her housebound existence, get over her homesickness and come to terms with exile. She takes a young lover, who initially brings tenderness and fulfilment to her life and introduces her to politics, though she later comes to reject him when he embraces a crude Islamic fundamentalism. Her husband (superbly played by Indian comedian Satish Kaushik) briefly comes into his own when he stands up against the arrogant cultural isolationism of the Islamists in their post-9/11 mode, and then he liberates Nazneen by deciding to return to Bangladesh. The film rings true but is socially on the thin side. It would probably have been better as a TV mini-series, as were two comparable novels on similar themes, Hanif Kureishi&apos;s The Buddha of Suburbia and Zadie Smith&apos;s White Teeth Great claims are being made for Malaysian-born Taiwanese director Tsai Ming-Liang, currently the subject of a National Film Theatre retrospective. A couple of years back, I greatly enjoyed his Goodbye, Dragon Inn (2003), a haunting and haunted film set in a Taipei cinema. But I was puzzled and bored by his two latest pictures, I Don&apos;t Want to Sleep Alone (getting an extended NFT screening) and The Wayward Cloud (currently receiving a limited release). Featuring the same leading actor and actress, both are set during periods of sickness that affect the drifting, listless characters. In the perversely erotic The Wayward Cloud, the hero performs in porn movies and he and the heroine experience a debilitating heatwave and a chronic water shortage, and never has Taiwan been more wan. I Don&apos;t Want to Sleep Alone finds the malaise in Malaysia as guest workers from Bangladesh, Japan, Taiwan and China cough their way around a smog-choked Kuala Lumpur, comforting and exploiting one another. In both, necrophilia is in the air. Clearly there&apos;s a talent here that&apos;s worthy of anyone&apos;s attention. Briefly, two curiosities. The Canadian black comedy Weirdsville takes place on a snowy winter night in a small Ontario township. Two cheerful stoners, planning a robbery to pay off a debt, get involved with violent dwarfs, satanists, a millionaire hippie in a coma, a junkie prostitute who appears to be dead and a Russian drug baron and his henchman. Likable and mildly amusing. Michel Spinosa&apos;s Anna M advertises itself as a Fatal Attraction-style thriller in which a deranged Parisian girl stalks a successful married doctor. It is, in fact, a case history of erotomania that takes its chapter headings - &apos;Illumination&apos;, &apos;Hope&apos;, &apos;Disappointment&apos; and &apos;Hatred&apos; - from the clinical names for the successive stages of the condition. It will be of interest to medical students."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/23/soundandfury", "publicationDate": "2007-11-23T17:30:22Z", "tags": ["Pakistan", "China", "Middle East and North Africa", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Agha Shahi, the former veteran Pakistan diplomat and foreign minister, said early this year, shortly before he died in August: &quot;We made a pact with Beijing in 1965 that ushered in decades of assistance we could not have got elsewhere.&quot; In 1971, Pakistan and China became even closer, when Shahi led calls for the People&apos;s Republic to win a seat at the UN Security Council where Chiang Kai-shek was the US-backed sitting representative of the Chinese people even though he had been reduced to Taiwan."], "title": "Sound and fury", "article": "How do we assess the significance of Pakistan&apos;s Commonwealth Asbo? After all it has happened once before, when Musharraf took power in the coup of 1999, and then did little to inhibit the greed of the Pakistan military who Britain went on to fund and arm, even as they stripped the country of its assets while continuing to play footsie with al-Qaida and the Taliban. The decision this time around was also a trifle forced, if not half-hearted, moved by so-called consensus rather than a free vote, as some member states would have felt obliged to abstain or even have opposed it. Isn&apos;t this all an unappealing throwback to the days of bearskins and cockatoo feathers, a decision made by an anachronistic body with no real political pulling power that continues to evoke the slightly stale wood polish and iodine kipper smell of the days of Empire? In Pakistan, among the middle classes caught in the midst of the chaos, the decision has resounded fairly well (our friends there tell us), as perhaps the first concrete demonstration of disapproval by the west since Pervez Musharraf plunged Pakistan into chaos by mounting a coup against himself. The US has bent over backwards not to offend the Generalissimo publicly, even while a succession of officials, from Negroponte to Rice, have queued up to entreat him to drop the uniform and stage the poll. So careful has everyone been not to upset the nuclear applecart (an image underpinned by the spurious and entirely false assumption that if Musharraf goes the comparatively poorly armed and geographically isolated jihadis will take over Rawalpindi and the bomb programme) that what has most commonly greeted the sight of thousands of progressives - journalists, lawyers, teachers and human rights activists - being caged as part of Musharraf&apos;s perverse fight to root our radical Islamists, is a flailing of arms. In truth, western nations find themselves without a rejoinder - or more worryingly, even a plan. It would be tempting to speculate that Musharraf - a man increasingly isolated and unpopular, a pathological people-pleaser, an officer very much motivated by appearances rather than actions - might feel a little hurt. But other than that, a cold hard empirical analysis of what has been said and all that it means, would find unfavourably against Pakistan&apos;s Commonwealth exclusion order. It, like the sounds and fury that has emanated from elsewhere, is a thoroughly meaningless act, by a toothless body regarded even by some of its member-states as a ceremonial drinking club. The exclusion is yet more evidence of the kabuki being played out where the west, caught without an idea, continually dreams up ways of doing nothing to disturb the status quo, silently accepting the military&apos;s excesses, while gesticulating like a drowning man. Instead of meaningless symbolism, our leaders should hold their hands up, even behind closed doors, and admit they have got things wrong. They have fomented a crisis in Pakistan by declining to assist the civil nation-state that exists beyond the assets controlled by the military. A second meaningful act would be for Britain and the US to immediately stop all aid to the military, particularly that which enables the generals to procure the prestigious items that give them kudos, while dramatically increasing the flow to humanitarian causes, including those which deal with the civil society that the military is waging a war against. The third action is the most painful and requires a studied look at our loss of influence in Pakistan. Anyone who has spent any time considering this last question would see that while the US and the west backed away from Pakistan after 1989 - when the Soviets were forced out of Afghanistan - other nations remained constant, while an anti-western policy of defiance took hold among Pakistan&apos;s military elite. China and Saudi Arabia were the constants. Agha Shahi, the former veteran Pakistan diplomat and foreign minister, said early this year, shortly before he died in August: &quot;We made a pact with Beijing in 1965 that ushered in decades of assistance we could not have got elsewhere.&quot; In 1971, Pakistan and China became even closer, when Shahi led calls for the People&apos;s Republic to win a seat at the UN Security Council where Chiang Kai-shek was the US-backed sitting representative of the Chinese people even though he had been reduced to Taiwan. In 1972, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto signed a series of assistance agreements that made China the principal source of military equipment for Pakistan, a deal that was augmented in May 1976, when Bhutto visited Beijing and signed a covert nuclear assistance pledge. &quot;Since then they gave, and asked for no money.&quot; Saudi Arabia, likewise, was there for Pakistan. It had pumped in black cash during the 1980s. But unlike Britain, it didn&apos;t stop the flow when the Red Army withdrew. While US aid during the decade of the 1990s, when democracy was fragile in Pakistan, amounted to only $1 million a year, the Saudis ploughed millions into religious education and Pakistan&apos;s nuclear programme, both of which flourished while democracy was undermined by the men in khaki and the madrasas. Over the same period of time, the officer core understood the prevalent view of the military leadership that the US and the west could never be trusted to be loyal. They developed strategies and goals contrary to our own, many of which we can see being played out today. The most obvious of these involves Afghanistan where Britain supports the western leaning Hamid Karzai, while the military want to bring him down in favour of a conservative Pashtun leader, and are actively pursuing that goal by fomenting terror in Waziristan and over the border in Helmand. Perhaps, as a result of our fickleness in our handling of the past and our lack of sophistication in the present, it is to China and the Saudis that we should be looking, as the only reliable allies of Islamabad who are able to get a message home. Whether that message would be favourable to the west - is an altogether different question."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2007/nov/26/whyexeterpapersafghanistan", "publicationDate": "2007-11-26T08:30:00Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "Regional & local newspapers", "Newspapers", "War reporting"], "sentences": ["It came from Meyrick Rudd of Exeter who explained that he is &quot;currently on holiday in Taiwan.&quot; It struck me, once again, how wonderful it is to be able to transmit news online.", "By accessing the Echo&apos;s website from Taiwan, Mr Rudd has been able to get a personal message through to a friend in Afghanistan."], "title": "Why Exeter paper's Afghanistan initiative deserves wider audience", "article": "At face value, this Exeter Echo story is not particularly remarkable.

She will spend 15 days in Helmand province with 40 Commando Royal Marines and 6 Rifle Company. But in these days of newspaper cutbacks it&apos;s great to see that a small regional daily - its circulation is just 22,000 - is prepared to pay for a journalist to take a trip abroad. So, well done to Northcliffe for that. Then there is the mission itself. An Exeter school started a &quot;treats for troops&quot; campaign, organising Christmas gifts for the soldiers, and the paper has offered its support. No national title has been as pro-active thus far. Does that reflect a concern about the lack of popular support for the Afghani engagement? So, the Echo and its editor, Marc Astley, deserve a pat on the back for an initiative that larger papers have ignored. Astley tells me that Naomi - a trainee with just eight months&apos; experience - is kitted out with a camcorder and laptop, so she is hoping to transmit video reports as well as writing a daily blog. It will be the paper&apos;s first attempt at receiving &quot;outside broadcast&quot; footage, and reflects its conversion to convergence. It is a multi-media news outlet nowadays. Finally, on a similar tack, I noticed a reader&apos;s comment on the paper&apos;s website asking Naomi to pass on a supportive message to a marine who, it transpires, acts as a media intermediary. It came from Meyrick Rudd of Exeter who explained that he is &quot;currently on holiday in Taiwan.&quot; It struck me, once again, how wonderful it is to be able to transmit news online. By accessing the Echo&apos;s website from Taiwan, Mr Rudd has been able to get a personal message through to a friend in Afghanistan. In this case, I guess it will be delivered verbally by Naomi... unless the troops in Helmand have been provided with computers to log on themselves to thisisexeter.co.uk.

Blame America'", "article": "European leaders worried about the rise of the euro against the Chinese yuan would be better advised to go to the real source of the problem: the United States and the &quot;excessive devaluation&quot; of the dollar. That was the blunt message from China&apos;s prime minister Wen Jiabao, speaking to EU leaders at the end of a summit in the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square, after being pressed to revalue the Chinese currency. Despite reports that China would revalue or realign the yuan against the dollar next month, Wen said that there was little he could do about the fact that the Chinese currency had gained 11.9% against the greenback since mid-2005 but fallen against the euro by 8%. Apart from turmoil in global financial markets, he said, the dollar&apos;s continuing devaluation worldwide was the main reason for the euro&apos;s rise against the yuan. The rising value of the euro has caused a huge political and economic problem for eurozone leaders. The EU is China&apos;s biggest trading partner, but the exchange rate is contributing to a trade deficit with China that is growing at \u20ac15m an hour. It reached \u20ac130bn last year and is likely to be \u20ac170bn this year, surpassing even the giant deficit of the US. The rapid growth of China&apos;s economy is bringing cheap goods for European consumers but creating severe problems for manufacturers. Already disadvantaged by higher costs, they are now punished by the high value of the euro, which makes their goods more expensive in China. They are also hampered by barriers to European exports that are said to cost EU firms \u20ac20bn a year in lost trade opportunities. Similar problems are affecting trade with the US after the euro&apos;s rise to an all-time high against the dollar. Last week the chief executive of Airbus, Tom Enders, warned that the exchange rate would put the company out of business because it builds planes in euros but sells them in dollars.  Threat Against that background, the threat of protectionism also hangs over EU-China relations. Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg premier who has headed the so-called eurogroup of ministers that has been in Beijing this week, said there could be &quot;protectionist reactions&quot; in Europe if China did not act.  There was some encouragement for the Europeans. Wen promised that China would further modernise the revised exchange rate mechanism introduced in 2005 in a &quot;gradual, proactive and manageable manner&quot; so it became fully convertible, allowing a greater free flow of capital into the world&apos;s third-largest economy.  Wen, who agreed to set up a joint EU-China working group on the issue, appeared to bear out the ultra-cautious remarks of European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet that China was &quot;perhaps&quot; moving towards revaluing the yuan against the euro. &quot;We were told that this is something which is being examined but I will not go further,&quot; he told reporters after he, Juncker, and Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner, held unprecedented talks with China&apos;s central bank governor, finance minister and Wen on the issue. The EU&apos;s leading anti-protectionist, trade commissioner Peter Mandelson, who has this week berated China for denying European goods and services access to its domestic market, welcomed moves by Wen and president Hu Jintao to recognise and take measures to reverse the ballooning deficit.  &quot;I arrived unhappy and leave more encouraged,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s a clearly stated political commitment by the Chinese leadership at the highest level to address the deficit, including market access and intellectual property issues. This is what we were seeking.&quot; According to EU sources Hu said during the one-day summit that he did not favour a sizeable trade surplus with the EU. &quot;I am ready to work with you to reduce our surplus and ready to import more EU products,&quot; he was said to have remarked, agreeing to set up another joint working group on the issue. Not all EU officials were impressed. &quot;We invested heavily in this summit and all we&apos;ve got is two working groups. It&apos;s been a complete waste of time. The Chinese, who will change their government in March, bringing in new interlocutors, are doing the usual: playing for time and delaying decisions,&quot; one EU delegate said. No one in the EU delegation expected an overnight conversion of the Chinese to currency revaluation or cutting the trade deficit. Mr Juncker suggested it welcomed the role a revalued yuan could play in dampening the risk of inflation and helping to rebalance the economy away from overseas export-led investment towards private consumption. But it remained clear that the EU still fails to understand fully the policy attitudes of China&apos;s leadership as it grapples with 11.5% growth and promotes employment at all costs.

Gu\u00e9henno declared that because of Khartoum&apos;s actions we are fast approaching a moment in which members of the UN security council will have to ask a critical question:  Do we move ahead with the deployment of a force that will not make a difference, that will not have the capability to defend itself and that carries the risk of humiliation of the security council and the United Nations and tragic failure for the people of Darfur?  The question, of course, answers itself. Privately, Gu\u00e9henno and other UN officials suggest an even gloomier picture of a mission that has already largely collapsed and is far behind on deployment benchmarks. To be sure, the unprecedented UN/African Union &quot;hybrid&quot; mission in Darfur (UNAMID) has been badly compromised by the refusal of militarily capable nations of the world to provide the two dozen transport and tactical helicopters required, at a bare minimum, for security and protection operations in Darfur. Not a single Nato country has offered even one helicopter. Sadly, this serves as too accurate a measure of the real concern for Darfur on the part of those whose rhetoric has been most fulsome. But it is brazen obduracy on the part of the Khartoum regime that has created the deepest threat that the people of Darfur will be left entirely without protection, and that humanitarian operations will have to be suspended throughout the region. The UN estimates that 4.2 million people are currently in need of humanitarian assistance. Of course Khartoum&apos;s obduracy has long been in evidence. Four months after the security council authorised the present peace support operation to Darfur under Resolution 1769, and 15 months after a previous security council resolution authorised a similar operation, Khartoum is still objecting to the UN/AU-proposed roster of countries that are to provide troops, civilian police and engineering and medical units. Khartoum refuses to grant landing rights to heavy transport aircraft or allow night flights (critical for both civilian protection and medivac needs). It refuses to grant adequate access to the Port of Sudan or expedited off-loading of equipment there. And it refuses to grant adequate land or water rights in the arid Darfur region. What will follow from a UN decision to abort UNAMID? Utter catastrophe. The exceedingly weak, under-manned, and under-resourced African Union mission in Darfur will collapse entirely. This badly demoralised force is barely functioning now and is simply trying to hold on until December 31 2007, when the AU mission is supposed to be incorporated into UNAMID under UN auspices. But given Khartoum&apos;s obstructionism, this transfer will be at best symbolic: there may be UN auspices but no meaningful deployment of UN troops or resources. And as soon as it becomes clear that a meaningful UNAMID is not deploying, African nations will quickly withdraw their troops, which have already endured an unconscionable number of casualties, most at the hands of rebel groups that resent AU impotence on the ground and political accommodation of Khartoum&apos;s g\u00e9nocidaires by AU leaders. This will leave no protection forces of any kind, for civilians or humanitarians Last January humanitarian organisations made clear they felt they had reached the furthest extreme of tolerable insecurity. One open letter came from a group of six distinguished nongovernmental organisations; another open letter came from all 14 UN operational humanitarian organisations in Darfur, including Unicef and the World Food Programme. No UN humanitarian operation had previously issued such a clear and public warning of impending collapse. These organisations, too, have been holding on with the hope that the UN would finally provide protection for them and the civilians they so courageously serve. If they are disappointed in their hopes, they will leave; an already intolerable situation will rapidly collapse into anarchy. With no international presence - by the UN, by the AU or by international aid organisations - there will be nothing to constrain Khartoum or the rebels or the various armed elements and bandits that contribute so much to present insecurity. Confrontations between Khartoum&apos;s armed forces, including its Janjaweed militia allies, and camps for displaced persons are likely to escalate quickly, and may become a series of pitched battles. Khartoum is likely to use its Antonov bombers and helicopter gun ships in such battles, ensuring massively disproportionate civilian casualties in and around some 200 camps. It is intolerable that the international community seems prepared to accept what will be cataclysmic human destruction. There can hardly be any doubt that the UNAMID force is badly conceived, has an ambiguous command-and-control structure, and is excessively reliant on African nations that cannot provide adequate numbers of fully-equipped, self-sufficient troops and civilian police per UN standards. The hybrid nature of the mission was itself a poorly calculated concession to Khartoum in the wake of the regime&apos;s defiance of the previous UN resolution authorising force to Darfur, Resolution 1706, passed on August 31 2006. But UNAMID is now the only arrow in the quiver: there is no other force on the horizon, no other means for protecting civilians and humanitarians. If Nato nations aren&apos;t prepared to provide the 24 helicopters the UN mission requires, they are hardly likely to participate in or provide resources for any non-consensual deployment of force to Darfur, a nightmarishly difficult logistical and military undertaking in any event. UNAMID must succeed. If it does not, the only question is only how long it will be before Darfur slides into cataclysmic destruction, with no means of halting that slide. This is the stark choice before the international community: is it prepared to see UNAMID fail, or will it rally the resources and exert the pressure on Khartoum, both of which are both critical to UNAMID&apos;s success? The UN secretary-general and under-secretary for peacekeeping should send public, individual letters to every militarily capable nation within the world body, asking why it cannot provide at least one of the required helicopters. The public should make explicit demands of their governments, especially countries that possess significant amounts of military equipment, like the required helicopters: the US, the UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa and India. But again, the larger problem, and thus the larger task, is to exert sufficient pressure on Khartoum to end its obstructionist ways. The key here is China, widely recognised - including within the UN&apos;s political offices - as having unrivalled leverage with the National Islamic Front (National Congress Party) regime. China alone of the major powers can demand of Khartoum (if no doubt behind closed doors) that the broad campaign to stall and ultimately eviscerate UNAMID must end. And yet, a well-placed UN official recently told me that it is the consensus at Turtle Bay that China was becoming more, not less, supportive of Khartoum&apos;s intransigence. After a brief but apparently successful Darfur public relations campaign, Beijing has evidently decided that it may resume its uncritical support of all decisions made by the NIF regime, no matter what the consequences for the people of Darfur. Either this changes, or there is no chance that Khartoum will be moved by other actors. In turn, this obliges nations like Germany, France, the US, and the UK to use the very considerable leverage deriving from their individual bilateral relations with Beijing to push China to act. Currently, all four of these major Western powers have moved Darfur to the third- or even fourth-tier in bilateral relations. Germany and France seem much more concerned about trade relations with China than Darfur, despite the tough talk coming from Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy. The UK under Gordon Brown seems adrift after years of vacuous rhetoric from Tony Blair&apos;s government. And the US places Taiwan, North Korea, Iran, trade and international terrorism far, far above any professed concern for Darfur. Again, civil society must play the key role of demanding that China, vulnerably exposed host of the 2008 Olympic Games, be pushed hard to use its massive influence with Khartoum to change the regime&apos;s behaviour. It&apos;s a long shot. But the odds against protecting the people of Darfur become greater every day, and we are now at the tipping point. Urgency is the essential watchword: we have only days or weeks before allowing events to be set in motion that will see many hundreds of thousands of people die."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/dec/02/women.fashion", "publicationDate": "2007-12-02T00:07:32Z", "tags": ["Women", "Life and style", "Fashion"], "sentences": ["When it launched in Taiwan, riot police were required to contain the hysterical throng, and 30 people ended up in hospital."], "title": "Mimi Spencer on how the handbag defined 2007", "article": "It seems a fitting finale to 2007.

As a result, they are six-month wonders. Come next year, these perishable, one-season beasts will be ancient news, stowed away in the backs of wardrobes, glumly gathering dust. Here&apos;s one US fashion editor speaking to The New York Times last month: &apos;Some people still carry the YSL Muse,&apos; she sniffed. &apos;They think the Muse is hot, because they&apos;re kind of behind.&apos; &apos;I bought three Chlo\u00e9 Paddington bags, which of course no one carries any more. And I bought a Dior saddle bag in every colour available. Again, they aren&apos;t fashionable any more, so I can&apos;t use them.&apos; Actress Donatella Panayiotou, 23, quoted in the Daily Mail, March 2007 You can, in part, blame the Wags of 2006 for this strange state of affairs. With access to all the money in the world, these young women mostly went shopping. And they mostly bought handbags (so much so, you might recall that Victoria Beckham and Coleen McLoughlin were enraged when Alex Curran snapped up a Chlo\u00e9 snakeskin tote before they&apos;d got a look in). As an unexpected result of Waggery, Balenciaga - apparently horrified at the association - changed the name of its Lariat bag to &apos;the First&apos;. They needn&apos;t have worried. Wags have done wonders for the sales of designer bags, making them the infatuation of every dizzy girl in the land. They may no longer be selling to the hush-hush gilded rich. But they&apos;re selling. Fast. And in a game where almost anyone&apos;s a player, some bags - the Forever, the Tribute, the limited-edition Carolyn - have gone grander still. Rarely glimpsed on anything as pedestrian as a shop floor, they&apos;re ferreted away to be viewed by special appointment. In this odd, keepy-uppy new world, handbag aficionados have Fendi on speed-dial. They have the Harrods&apos; personal shopper on alert to call them should a new consignment of YSL Uptown bags jet in. They may even attempt an invite-only visit to the Louis Vuitton workshop in Asni\u00e8res-sur-Seine, where darling new It Bags are born. For these passionate few, the handbag is idol, fetish, heart-throb. Here&apos;s model Jasmine Lennard, 22, on the moment she laid eyes on a new gold envelope bag in the window of Louis Vuitton: &apos;I rang their head office and told them I had to have it. It was like a deep burning inside me... If I had to choose, I&apos;d happily starve to death rather than forsake a bag.&apos; Or meet student Olivia Owen, 19. This year, she and her mother purchased a \u00a312,000 Balenciaga handbag, to share. &apos;It&apos;s a lot of money, yes,&apos; trilled Olivia in the Daily Mail, &apos;but so much stuff is expensive these days, like cars and houses. We thought of it as a similar investment. When it was delivered, I squealed with joy, and hugged the bag like a new puppy... When you see a bag that&apos;s right for you, it&apos;s like falling in love - money is no object. If I go out, I put it on a chair of its own, and even then I wipe it down first.&apos; &apos;This is a new category with almost unimaginable prices,&apos; says Marc Cohen, director at the luxury-goods market research specialists Ledbury Research. &apos;But demand is still there and the waiting lists are long... It&apos;s almost a case of &quot;build it and they will come&quot;; someone will almost always pay for it.&apos; Mulberry, for example, (a current favourite of our Home Secretary) will happily sell you a standard Bayswater bag for \u00a3495 - but have furnished the elite with the \u00a35,000 alligator version, complete with personalised initials, interior and service. &apos;That&apos;s a tenfold increase in price but there is demand,&apos; says chief operating officer Lisa Montague. &apos;There&apos;s a certain consumer who wants something that is unique and bespoke and they are willing to pay for it.&apos; This year, due to demand, New York&apos;s Bergdorf Goodman store allowed customers to order no more than three Chlo\u00e9 Paddingtons (around $1,500 a pop) every 30 days. The trickle-down effect of such insanity affects us all, shifting the mental goalposts until the prospect of spending \u00a3750 on a handbag doesn&apos;t seem odd at all. Curiously, while we&apos;re still quite content to scrabble about at Primark for budget clothes, we&apos;re far less likely to apply the same approach to our handbags. Women will use phrases such as &apos;I&apos;m worth it&apos;, &apos;I don&apos;t want to miss out&apos;, &apos;I want to lift my look above that of my friends&apos;- splurging on handbags, whether they can afford to or not. It&apos;s not surprising that the proportion of female bankrupts rose from 32 per cent in 2000 to 44 per cent today. But why do we do it? Are we insane? &apos;A great handbag works with many outfits so the price per wear starts to look very affordable. Plus, you don&apos;t need to worry about squeezing into it. It looks fabulous on every size.&apos; Nicola Sugden, handbag buyer for House of Fraser There are comfortingly practical reasons for the unparalleled success of the It Bag in 2007. For Stuart Vevers, creative director at Mulberry, &apos;it&apos;s something to do with the way women dress, in that now they dress much more casually so a designer bag has become a way to show that you&apos;re fashionable&apos;. Wear jeans, wear a T-shirt, add an It Bag and you&apos;re good to go. Get fat, get thin, add an It Bag and you&apos;re done. This simple equation has become the backbone of modern dressing. At work, the attention-seeking It Bag stops you looking like a corporate drone. It&apos;s an instant status symbol. Claire Birks at Mintel recognises the relationship between the rise of the It Bag and the increase in the number of women who work: &apos;We not only have the money,&apos; she says, &apos;but also the need for stylish, well-accessorised outfits and handbags&apos; - the justification for the outlay being &apos;I work hard; this is my reward&apos;. Melanie Rickey, fashion features editor at Grazia magazine, takes a more impassioned view. &apos;I think they&apos;re the ultimate symbol of a woman&apos;s emancipation,&apos; she says. &apos;A woman who stays at home doesn&apos;t need a bag. It&apos;s quite primal. It says you earn your own money, that you&apos;re your own woman. After all, men don&apos;t buy our handbags...&apos; It&apos;s true. Handbags are far too important a purchase to be entrusted to mere blokes. We&apos;ll do our own handbag shopping, thanks very much. But what makes them so provocative? So personal? So potent? We may not go as far as Germaine Greer and her theory that a tote bag is &apos;an exterior uterus&apos;, but most of us can admit to a certain umbilical connection with our bags. Women communicate via handbags. There&apos;s a language. We congratulate new owners and size up opponents. We notice. We admire. A handbag tells you what a woman thinks about herself, and how she ranks in the hierarchy of style. Who doesn&apos;t bond with their bag? It is armoury and arsenal. Try leaving the house without it. Impossible. Many of us will recognise the description from Pascale Mussard, creative director at Herm\u00e8s: &apos;They&apos;re like friends; they&apos;re everything, they&apos;re always next to your body...&apos; They&apos;re a pet. Something to love -that satisfying snap shut, the sumptuous suede interior, the winking gleam of a padlock... &apos;It sounds crazy to say that you spend your salary on handbags,&apos; sighs one bag addict, &apos;but I have to put my hand up and admit that this is true... A handbag is your friend. It moulds to you, and becomes like an extension of you.&apos; These days, they even come with built-in personalities; they&apos;re Edith or Roxy or Joni or Gisele. This christening tactic started long ago - with the Herm\u00e8s Kelly of 1956 - but now it&apos;s the industry norm, universally exploited ever since Sofia Coppola featured in a 2002 Marc Jacobs ad and he named the bag for her. What alchemy: to sell a slice of Sofia&apos;s magical cool to the masses! Today, the shelves of Selfridges are groaning with Adeles, Elvies, Nancys, Carolinas, Mabels and Maras. What&apos;s more, we can read all about the goings-on of these glamorous new bags in the pages of what is arguably 2007&apos;s most successful women&apos;s magazine - Grazia, the bible for the nation&apos;s growing breed of bag slaves. Melanie Rickey acknowledges the shift brought about by Grazia and its ilk: &apos;There has been this huge democratisation of luxury,&apos; she says, &apos;and it has changed everything. We said, &quot;Hey, it&apos;s accessible, it&apos;s not so mysterious, it&apos;s not just for red-carpet women, you can have one, too!&quot;&apos; &apos;Accessories are absolutely the new perfume.&apos; Cathy Horyn, New York Times fashion editor Leaf through any glossy magazine, and it&apos;s not sex that&apos;s being sold in those ads. It&apos;s not breasts and beauty. It&apos;s not even youth. It&apos;s handbags. At every successful &apos;fashion&apos; house now, the bag rules. You&apos;ll see it, lazing on a chaise longue, clutched in the skinny mitt of a teenage model. You&apos;ll see it clasped to the chest of Nicole Kidman or Keira Knightley. Accessories account for two-thirds of Prada&apos;s profits, and 80 per cent of Gucci&apos;s, with sales everywhere growing at twice the rate of clothes. Little wonder that a new It Bag can make the cover of a magazine. While the clothes - remember them? - lend a house its high-gloss look, it&apos;s the bags that are the earners, the grafters, the muscle. Of course, there&apos;s a whole compendium of reasons why big business wants you to buy its bags, and they&apos;re all commercial rather than creative. Handbags are simplicity itself to sell. They don&apos;t require changing rooms, or much in the way of display space. One size fits all. They&apos;re not particularly culture-specific. And the margins are stupendous. As Dana Thomas writes in her book Deluxe: How Luxury Lost its Lustre, many &apos;luxury&apos; goods are now outsourced, produced in huge quantities in &apos;the crowded factories in China, full of workers gluing together &quot;Made in Italy&quot; bags by the thousands&apos;. Says Marc Cohen of Ledbury Research: &apos;As luxury goods become a mature industry - driven by the consolidation of companies into conglomerates such as LVMH and PPR/Gucci - they need to make profits. Accessories enable the brands to sell to a wide audience while retaining the exclusivity of their core goods.&apos; For many women today, bags are fashion. Clothes barely register. Tamara Mellon, owner of the Jimmy Choo label, calls the buying of a handbag &apos;a mood-altering exercise... We have seen a remarkable transition over the past few years whereby women will spend a significant amount on accessories; they&apos;re now making the statement that clothes used to make.&apos; Every brand is therefore desperate to produce the &apos;definitive bag of the season&apos;. Even relative newcomers are subject to the It Bag pull. Designer Luella Bartley admits that the thirst for an It Hit &apos;drives us mad. The commercial people ask for five It Bags a season, but they&apos;re accidental things. Everyone tries to create some theory to it, but it&apos;s impossible to design one to order.&apos; You can, however, maximise your chances of success by throwing them at compliant celebrities. Have you ever, perhaps, wondered why Lindsay Lohan is wearing the not-yet-quite-available Mahala Tote in electric blue by Jimmy Choo? Or noticed that the very next day, she&apos;ll be wearing a Louis Vuitton Olympe Stratus? And looky here! It&apos;s Eva Longoria with the python Pitone Frame bag from Prada, and there&apos;s Hilary Duff with the LV Monogram Dentelle and the LV Damier Azur Pouch (the two-timing Jezebel!). In today&apos;s saturated market, huge numbers of bags compete for A-list patronage. The biggest bearers include Jessica Simpson, Sienna Miller, Beyonc\u00e9 - though, interestingly, Victoria Beckham is said to pay for most of hers (rumour has it that the bill at Herm\u00e8s has touched $2 million). Still, anyone with a bit of know-how and not much in the way of scruples needn&apos;t stretch quite that far... &apos;These thieves aren&apos;t stupid, they know exactly which bags there is a demand for.&apos; Designer Anya Hindmarch in the London Evening Standard last month According to the Metropolitan Police, 2007 has been the year of the Handbag Smash-and-Grab. In October, Hindmarch&apos;s Notting Hill boutique was raided and thieves made off with \u00a320,000-worth of her Lautner bags - by far the most popular style of the season, as worn by actresses Reese Witherspoon and Anne Hathaway. The previous month, a similar attack at Marc Jacobs Mayfair store targeted the Stam bag (\u00a3760). Earlier, Luella Bartley&apos;s store in London&apos;s West End took a hit, losing every single Bernie bag (\u00a3525) in stock. Clearly, someone with impressive bag cred was behind the London raids. Police have called it a &apos;crime de luxe&apos;, and it&apos;s a true sign of the times. The black-market value of hard-to-get handbags has shot up, and they couldn&apos;t be easier to nick: &apos;Thieves love small things, and handbags are relatively tiny,&apos; a former Metropolitan Police officer comments. &apos;You also need to remember that eBay has become a massive research facility for criminals - it gives them the state of the market in five minutes.&apos; In another shift, if the real thing is out of reach, plenty of us will now settle for a fake. As Tatler magazine put it last month: &apos;Americans buy $1,000 [Birkin] fakes on the beach in Sardinia even though they have the real thing back home. Why on earth buy a fake if you&apos;ve got a proper Birkin? &quot;Because one is not enough&quot;... it&apos;s the fashion equivalent of a multiple orgasm.&apos; And if you won&apos;t fake it, you can always persuade yourself that the designer bags showing up at knock-down prices on websites like shortiez.com and fashionbags.me.uk are genuine (I couldn&apos;t possibly say). Otherwise, simply log on to bagborroworsteal.com or frombagstoriches.com and hire a designer bag for the evening. See? In 2007, everyone - from Posh Spice to Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, from bankers to nurses - can bag a moment of glory. And yet, something subtle is starting to shift. One fashion journalist confided to me, &apos;After reading the Deluxe book, we know we&apos;re being conned. It&apos;s a bit sickening, dropping \u00a32k on a bag. The profit margins are huge. I know that the cost price of an \u00a3850 bag is probably \u00a3250, because that&apos;s what I pay as a perk of my job.&apos; Grazia&apos;s Melanie Rickey is certain that we&apos;re witnessing the last act of a farce. &apos;The whole bag thing is coming to an end,&apos; she says. &apos;We&apos;ve got plenty now - and, what with the credit crunch... I can safely say that I&apos;ve got enough. Yes, we went crazy for them. But all those garish tassels and add-ons are phasing out - we&apos;ve gone back to the classics. I&apos;ve just done a photoshoot with TV presenter Alexa Chung - and what she wanted was a plain black Chanel bag; it&apos;s a backlash against things like the Zagliani Botoxed-snakeskin bag, which is so vulgar I could only bear to wear it in Cannes.&apos; So what next for the design houses? With Bank of England governor Mervyn King promising a marked slowdown in economic growth, with the art market wavering and the housing market teetering, with analysts promising that we&apos;ll soon have to rein in our spending habits, is the handbag bubble set to burst? Burberry, for one, is in no mood to surrender. It posted a 31-per-cent profit rise in the first half of 2007 - buoyed by sales of its silver-studded Knight bag. The Americans, though, are less sanguine. Barneys fashion director recently remarked that &apos;our customers seem to be looking for something more interesting. They don&apos;t want to spend money on something everyone else has&apos;. Elizabeth Kiester, chief creative director of LeSportsac, which is developing a line of bags with Stella McCartney for 2008, is similarly jaded: &apos;That $5,000 It Bag is so yesterday&apos;s news,&apos; she says. &apos;The luxury market is so over the top now that it is demented. I call them limo bags. I don&apos;t even have a limo.&apos; But don&apos;t cut up that credit card just yet. &apos;The It activity has gone down to shoes,&apos; reports Rickey. &apos;Those Balenciaga &quot;Meccano&quot; shoes on eBay for \u00a34,000 and the hand-carved heels at Prada...&apos; I can almost hear her heart rate quicken.

Educators will attend the show from all over the globe to participate in discussion and networking. Last year, 14% of Bett attendees were from overseas. This event is becoming more of a pull for educators looking for new ideas and to tell others about their own work with ICT. For instance this year&apos;s show will include a new French area highlighting the top French educational ICT suppliers. The British Council Study Tour is an another example of international interest. Some 50 other overseas participants interested in procedures, planning and policies and in what the UK is doing right and wrong in ICT and education are coming to Bett to talk, look at the show and attend seminars. Ray Barker, director of the British Educational Suppliers Association (Besa),says: &quot;Bett is very much a growth area for international parties. It&apos;s about making ICT work and developing new and exciting products. It&apos;s swish, with everyone who&apos;s anybody in education under the same roof for one week.&quot; The Moving Young Minds world ministerial seminar is a major annual conference that coincides with Bett. Ministers of Education from Brunei to the Cayman Islands will travel to the UK to participate in a discussion of ICT in education. This year, more than 60 ministers will attend a three-day event covering British schools, a conference, and Bett. International links are an important part of the curriculum today. Dai Thomas, director of ICT at Warden Park school in West Sussex, a specialist school in ICT, maths and modern foreign languages through global communication, is working on links from his school to two schools for deaf children in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The main objective of the partnership is to use Moodle, a virtual learning environment, to share work with a strong visual aspect due to the requirements of the children taking part in the project. A rich number of resources have been developed from the work carried out by the students, ranging from ways of working with deaf pupils to continuous professional development. Remote learning Teachers from Chennai have travelled to the UK and received training on Moodle from Dai Thomas, and now he is supporting those teachers on Moodle remotely, using training videos he has helped create in his school. He hopes to use these video resources to expand training on Moodle in Sussex. Also majoring in videoconferencing is UniServity, a collaborative learning platform developer. UniServity and the British Council have recently launched the Climate Cool project with regular live video links, enabling pupils and environmental experts from different countries to simultaneously discuss their own personal experiences of climate change and what can be done to combat it. Many teachers are using international links. Lawrence Williams, assistant head at the Holy Cross school in Surrey, is building an online community with schools in China, Taiwan and, soon, Korea. These communities share and work collaboratively using ICT across the curriculum, with the aim of building useful materials for students and teachers in the UK, China and Taiwan. One project Williams is developing uses ICT tools to support year 7 Mandarin lessons. The Stories for Children project on the MirandaNet website is created by students and teachers, and is now being further developed to create a library of online, animated, voice-over PowerPoint stories in English and Mandarin, for schools in both the UK and China to download and use in the classroom or at home. Peaceful debate Another project on the MirandaNet website is the Peace Room. This began life in 1940s South Africa, when a grandmother decided she didn&apos;t want her grandchildren to grow up in a violent world. She built the Peace Room in her garden, and encouraged her grandchildren, then their friends, to debate through nomination, justification and voting, who should be allowed to come into the Peace Room for making a good contribution to the world. Andr\u00e9e Jordan, head of faculty social sciences at the Ravensbourn school in Kent, heard this story and put the Peace Room online to encourage students across the world to debate with each other. She hopes that soon the site, using secure online learning facility Rafi.ki, will step forward into videoconferencing. However, some teachers feel they are left on the outside at Bett. Poncelet Ileleji, co-ordinator for the Gambia YMCA&apos;s computer training centre in Banjul, the Gambia, West Africa, is not able to attend ICT shows such as Bett due to funding issues, despite a plethora of ideas and experiences to share and grow. Ileleji provides ICT training to people in the Gambia, from businesses and NGOs to young people. His organisation also supports communities in ICT development using ICT tools for advocacy programs in HIV and Aids, news, and health awareness. For Bett to be truly international, it needs to ensure that doors can be opened, perhaps through videoconferencing, to all educators throughout the world.

LED BLU screens are typically used for 7in digital photo frames and portable DVD players, and in the subnotebook market. The increasing availability of these 7in screens underlay Microsoft&apos;s attempt to bump-start a UMPC market with Origami. (I&apos;d assume the OLPC uses one.) AppleInsider says:  Though often referred to as an &apos;ultra-portable,&apos; the upcoming Apple notebook design was revealed by AppleInsider earlier this year to have been built around a 13.3-inch LED backlit display, rather than 12.1-inch display or one smaller. The 13.3-inch LED BLU orders mentioned by DigiTimes are expected serve an initial manufacturing ramp of the notebook early next year.    This sounds like the kind of machine that fits in what PC manufacturers call the thin-and-light category, which is different from handhelds, ultramobiles, tablets, subnotebooks, notebooks, laptops, desktop replacements, gaming notebooks, toughbooks and so on. Most of these are markets where Apple does not compete; it has never offered a subnotebook PC. If the new machine is about an inch thick, weighs around 3lbs (less than 2kg) and has no CD/DVD drive then it might be better described as an ultraportable, though technically a 13.3in screen is slightly too big. (Ultraportables typically have 10.6 to 12.1in screens.) It will definitely be too big to qualify as a subnotebook (ie significantly smaller than a 11 x 8.5in Compaq LTE, which defined the notebook format in 1989), though a subnotebook Mac would be nice...."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/dec/05/politics.schools", "publicationDate": "2007-12-05T23:47:55Z", "tags": ["UK news", "Politics", "Schools", "Education"], "sentences": ["Taiwan came top in maths."], "title": "Britain slumps in world league table for maths and reading", "article": "Britain is sliding down the world league table in reading and maths, according to the findings of the most authoritative international study, published yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development downgraded the UK from seventh to 17th in reading, and eighth to 24th in maths. The scale of the research - the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) study involved independent tests last year on 400,000 teenagers from 57 countries - adds weight to the embarrassment for ministers. Last week Gordon Brown promised to make Britain &quot;a beacon to the world&quot; in upgrading skills and said the country &quot;cannot compete on low skills but only on high skills&quot;. Tables released last week for science showed the UK at 14th place, down from 4th when the last comparable UK results were published, in 2001. Michael Reiss, director of education at the Royal Society, said: &quot;How can the UK hope to compete economically in the future if our young people are not as well educated as those in other countries.&quot; The thinktank Civitas said the findings exposed rising GCSE and A-level scores as a &quot;charade&quot;. And Richard Lambert, the CBI&apos;s director general, said: &quot;At a time of increasing global competition, the UK cannot afford to be &apos;average&apos;.&quot; South Korea and Finland remain the world leaders. South Korea came top in reading, with New Zealand, Ireland, Australia and Estonia among those beating Britain. Finland was best for science and second in reading and maths. Taiwan came top in maths. The OECD said Poland was one of the countries most improved in reading, and Mexico and Greece made significant improvements in maths. The study found that streaming at an early age made socio-economic background more likely to affect results. The prime minister&apos;s spokesman said many of the scores were &quot;bunched&quot;, with differences slight. &quot;We can always do more, and certainly there is no room for complacency, but our own national curriculum tests and GCSE results tell us that standards are continuing to rise.&quot; Jim Knight, the schools minister, said: &quot;We are putting a relentless focus on the progress of every individual through programmes such as Every Child Counts and personalised learning so that we know exactly where progress is made and where children are falling behind.&quot; Michael Gove, the shadow children&apos;s secretary, said: &quot;Every year the government boasts about the improvements it has made to education but every external audit tells us we&apos;re falling further behind.&quot; David Laws, for the Liberal Democrats, called for a fundamental review of education policy in light of the results. &quot;British children&apos;s attainment has gone down in almost every league table despite a massive investment programme,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/06/china.jonathanwatts", "publicationDate": "2007-12-06T00:03:34Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Last month bosses from Japan, Korea and the US joined senior local politicians in Taiwan at a memorial service for Chen Chi-li, founder of the Bamboo Union gang."], "title": "Chinese police stage huge gang crackdown", "article": "Hundreds of police with semi-automatic weapons raided a hotpot restaurant and rounded up dozens of gangsters in one of the biggest crackdowns on crime syndicates seen in mainland China, the domestic media reported yesterday. The alleged gang boss, Lin Guoqin, a local politician and senior figure in the local business community, was among those arrested in the operation, which has highlighted the growing problem of organised crime in China. Such were the concerns about mob collusion with local police that senior officers were replaced or sent on holiday before the raid in Yangjiang city, Guangdong province, last month. Even those who took part were told it was a training exercise until a few hours before the operation so they could not tip off the suspects, according to the Beijing News. Planned a year in advance, the round-up reportedly started with a single warning shot as police swooped on the mobsters, who had gathered in a VIP room to celebrate the purchase of a five-storey house by their boss. Soon after they finished their first round of drinks, the police moved in. &quot;Suddenly the restaurant was surrounded by police, armed with submachine guns,&quot; a security guard told the Guangzhou Daily. &quot;They moved very quickly, as if they had come out of the sky.&quot; They arrested Lin and another alleged mob boss, Xu Jianqiang, along with several dozen underlings, who were led away with black bags over their heads. In coordinated raids in four cities police detained 45 suspected gangsters and confiscated eight guns. In the state media police described the gangsters as triads - the term usually associated with criminal organisations based in nearby Hong Kong and Macau. They are suspected of murder, assault, operating illegal casinos, loan sharking, abduction and extortion. &quot;The crackdown on the two triads has dealt a heavy blow to the secret societies that used to be active in the western part of the prosperous Guangdong region,&quot; Xiao Shengxian, a spokesman for the Guangdong provincial bureau of public security, told the China Daily. Lin was reportedly a member of the local People&apos;s Congress - the Communist-controlled council - as well as being vice-chairman of the chamber of commerce, a travel association and a group of leading entrepreneurs. He is said to have used intimidation to expand his business to 20 companies, covering cement production, dredging, seafood distribution and petrol sales. The last People&apos;s Congress representative arrested for gang membership was executed in Shenyang, northern China. In August a former police official who became a gang boss was sentenced to death in Kunming. China does not disclose statistics on organised crime, although public security officials have acknowledged that this is a &quot;huge-occurrence period&quot;. Since the opening up of the economy there has been a rise in drug use, prostitution, counterfeiting, smuggling and intimidation. Many gangs are in league with officials. With no independent judiciary or media in this one-party state, there are few channels to expose their activities. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, 4,000 gangs have been broken up since February 2006. Among them was a 34-strong gang in Beijing described by police as the capital&apos;s first criminal syndicate since the Communist party took power in 1949. Mafia-like groups are far more established elsewhere in east Asia.

Apart from organising expensive cocktail receptions, it is pushing as hard as it can the line that it is cheaper, easier and more efficient to pay for emissions reductions in developing countries, while developed countries continue to pollute.

Ideas on tap Talking of burning money, London mayor Ken Livingstone is drawing up his annual budget and will depend again on the Greens to get it through. This means that assembly member Darren Johnson and chums can write a green shopping list and, up to a point, Ken has to agree. This year&apos;s list is yards long and includes a demand that Thames Water puts free tap water on every restaurant table in London in &quot;stylish water carafes&quot;. It goes for the real jugular, though, when it demands a complete rethink on the \u00a3500m motorway-scale Thames Gateway bridge that Ken has backed for years but which is now in the mire after being sent back for a reopened public inquiry in 2009. The Greens want Ken to consider a more popular, far less damaging, public transport-only, non-road scheme in its place.

Joe Wright&apos;s adaptation of the Ian McEwan bestseller picked up nominations for a raft of prizes, including best film drama, best director, best actress in a drama (Keira Knightley) and best actor in a drama (James McAvoy). The nominations were announced this morning at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles. Atonement was joined in the best film drama category by No Country For Old Men, American Gangster, Eastern Promises, The Great Debaters, Michael Clayton and There Will Be Blood. Elsewhere, Tim Burton&apos;s Sweeney Todd appears the film to beat in the sister category of best comedy or musical. Burton&apos;s blood-spattered adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical was bracketed with Across the Universe, Hairspray, Charlie Wilson&apos;s War and Juno. The nominations spelled good news for British talent. Knightley and McAvoy were joined in the acting categories by Julie Christie (Away From Her), Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd), Tilda Swinton (Michael Clayton) and Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton). Joining Wright in the hunt for best director was Ridley Scott (American Gangster). Daniel Day-Lewis was anointed as the early favourite for the best actor Oscar with a Globe nomination for his tour-de-force as a corrupt oil tycoon in There Will Be Blood. However, the London-born performer has been an Irish citizen since 1993. The other big winners were the actors Cate Blanchett and Philip Seymour Hoffman, both of whom picked up a pair of nominations. Blanchett was nominated for both Elizabeth: The Golden Age and the Bob Dylan biopic I&apos;m Not There. Hoffman is in the running for his work in both The Savages and Charlie Wilson&apos;s War. A comic tale of covert US operations in 1980s Afghanistan, Charlie Wilson&apos;s War picked up five nominations, placing it second only to Atonement. The film stars Tom Hanks as a maverick US congressman and Julia Roberts as a Texas socialite. Both are nominated in the acting categories. The one big surprise of today&apos;s announcement was the absence of There Will Be Blood director Paul Thomas Anderson from the list of best director nominees. Instead, Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country For Old Men), Tim Burton (Sweeney Todd) and Julian Schnabel (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly) will join Wright and Scott in the chase for the top honour.

The film, released last week in the US, was nominated in all the major categories, including best drama, director, and screenplay. Its two leads, Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, both received nominations for the awards, which are due to be presented next month. The Globes, normally seen as a reliable precursor of the Oscars, suggested that this year&apos;s film awards season will be more open than ever. Seven films received nominations in the best drama category, while five were nominated for best musical or comedy. Nominations for best drama included the Coen brothers&apos; No Country for Old Men and Paul Thomas Anderson&apos;s California oil boom tale There Will Be Blood. Crime sagas American Gangster and Eastern Promises, the college drama The Great Debaters and the legal potboiler Michael Clayton rounded out the field. The best musical or comedy category saw nominations for the Beatles-inspired musical Across the Universe, the foreign policy comedy Charlie Wilson&apos;s War, musicals Hairspray and Sweeney Todd and the teen pregnancy tale Juno. British names dominated, from Julie Christie for her performance as a woman with Alzheimer&apos;s disease in Away From Her to Ronald Harwood for his screenplay for Julian Schnabel&apos;s adaptation of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. That film was one of two US productions nominated for best foreign language film. It was joined by The Kite Runner, and films from France, Romania and Taiwan. Awards season perennials also dominated the list, from Helena Bonham-Carter, to Hollywood royalty such as Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster and Angelina Jolie. British fare was also prominent in the TV categories, with dramas such as Longford, The State Within and Five Days all receiving nominations. Whether the stars will be able to grace the red carpet for the awards is in doubt. The Hollywood writers&apos; strike, now more than a month old, shows no sign of ending.

Harry Potter obsessives try to track the locations populated by the teenage wizards. New Zealand sold itself to holidaymakers on the back of The Lord of the Rings. Hong Kong though, found a burgeoning market in cinematic sex tourism earlier this year, thanks to an arthouse film director. Ang Lee&apos;s latest movie, Lust, Caution, was released in China in an expurgated print, with its very graphic sex scenes removed. In Hong Kong, however, they remained, and Chinese film-lovers made the trek to the city to see the film as the director intended. It was a rapturously received smash in Hong Kong (and Taiwan). The story of a group of young dissidents in 30s and 40s China hatching a plot to kill a brutal politician, Lust, Caution might have been expected to bowl over audiences in the US, too. After all, Americans are used to sex on screen, and Lee&apos;s previous film, Brokeback Mountain, had been a critical hit in the States. This time, though, they&apos;ve been lukewarm, and the movie has taken just $4.2m (\u00a32.1m) at the US box office. Lee, though, had foreseen the problems Americans might have with it. The sex wasn&apos;t the problem. If anything, the destructive and violent love affair between student actor Wong Chia Chi (newcomer Tang Wei) and the politician Yee (Tony Leung) was the movie&apos;s main selling point, even if those scenes attracted the dreaded NC-17 certificate - a rating that scares off multiplexes. What American audiences really seemed to struggle with was the slow-burn narrative style, the near three-hour running time, and the probing, painstaking way in which it explored aspects of recent Chinese social and political history. I meet Lee in the ballroom of an old Venetian hotel. In late afternoon, the room is dark and shadowy. It makes a suitable backdrop for a discussion of a film as ambiguous and unsettling as Lust, Caution. The Taiwanese director is unapologetic about his film. &quot;The pacing relates to the information that is given,&quot; he says. &quot;We Chinese need to go back to the world we used to live in. &quot;It&apos;s a lot of fun for the Chinese to watch the first half, to remind us of our innocence and how things used to be. Then comes the real deal. But for non-Chinese, you don&apos;t get that benefit. I am sure the Chinese viewer will have a blast, but when the western viewer reads subtitles, it is very frustrating. You have that feeling: what the hell is going on. But I had to make the movie right for myself and for the Chinese audience.&quot; A complex espionage thriller set in Shanghai and Hong Kong during the late 1930s and early 40s, Lust, Caution is not - at least to American eyes - a crowdpleaser in the vein of Lee&apos;s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Instead of gravity-defying martial artistry, it consists mainly of characters talking. When there is violence - for example, when the students try to assassinate a man who has a Rasputin-like aversion to dying - it is realistic and dismaying. When they plunge a knife in the man&apos;s stomach, it bounces out. And, like the violence, the sex is dealt with equally frankly. &quot;They [historians] tell you about the glorious war, the fight. They don&apos;t tell you that it is very hard to kill someone. They tell you that the women spies seduced the men and killed them. They don&apos;t tell you about the sex.&quot; Lee laughs wearily as he explains his attempts in the film to look behind the official stories about Japanese occupation of Shanghai. Just as he did in Brokeback Mountain (when adapting Annie Proulx&apos;s story for the screen), Lee has taken a short piece of fiction and has fleshed it out, giving it an epic quality. Lust, Caution is based on a 28-page story by Eileen Chang. &quot;She writes about women&apos;s sexuality and feeling for love during the most macho war we have had. It is like - how dare she!&quot; Lee says. &quot;It is very gutsy work. That triggers me to investigate my own upbringing and patriotism.&quot; It quickly becomes apparent, for Lee himself, how personal and even autobiographical Lust, Caution is. For example, Yee&apos;s very specific gait is based on that of Lee&apos;s father. The director admits to a close identification with the spy played by Tang Wei, too. &quot;When we were doing the movie, I used to joke that I carry the head and purity of the idealistic student Kuang Yu Min, the heart of Wong Chia Chi and the balls of Mr Yee,&quot; Lee says. He then adds that Tony Leung has projected aspects of Lee&apos;s own character into Yee. A curious remark, certainly, given that Yee isn&apos;t a remotely sympathetic character. He is a quisling, collaborating with the Japanese and overseeing the torture and killing of Chinese rebels. Then again, it is Yee&apos;s personal and sexual life that intrigues him. &quot;I desire it but I cannot do it. I make it into a movie. He projects a lot of that part of myself. It is a romance I never really experienced that I was longing for. It is almost like a dream.&quot; Like the students, whose high-minded ideals are shaken when they get their hands dirty with plotting and assassination, Lee acknowledges that he has been &quot;shocked by reality, naive in some ways, not really knowing what to do in an adult world, like a big kid&quot;. As for Wong, he identifies with her because: &quot;it seems that only by pretending, by getting far away from reality, she can reach her true self ... to touch the real you that you try to cover up.&quot; Meanwhile, Lee relished the chance to recreate his parents&apos; era and their way of thinking. His preparation was exhaustive. For instance, he and his casting directors saw 10,000 actors before finally choosing Tang Wei. Actor Tony Leung testifies that Lee was a ferociously demanding director: always asking for that little bit more, the different way to do the scene, the extra detail. The scenes that were the hardest to shoot were, inevitably, the sex scenes. The director admits that he felt extremely uncomfortable filming them. He was conscious that he was first engineering some extremely raw and intimate moments, and then intruding on them. &quot;For this project, I had to strip down and get to the heart of the darkness in some way,&quot; he says. His instinct, he says, as he filmed Leung and Tang Wei making love was to look the other way. &quot;I don&apos;t make pornography, so when you get down to that, it is very painful to shoot. You fight with your moral sense. You are deeply confused. It is embarrassing to coach the actors through it - to verbalise and to give indications. You are revealing your secrets when you are shooting like that.&quot; The sex scenes were shot on a closed set with only four people present - the couple, the director and the cinematographer. Lee defends the sex scenes as being utterly integral to the film. Yes, it is inevitable that the scandal surrounding these scenes will dominate discussion of the movie. &quot;That bothers me. It gives me sleepless nights.&quot; He and his collaborators have done their utmost to make the best film they can and all the journalists want to talk about is the sex. At a press conference earlier in the day, he had fielded the sex questions patiently enough. Did they really do it? To Lee, that isn&apos;t the right question. What is important is that the audience has to believe in the scenes. Look at the eyes, not the bodies. In the end, though, Lee&apos;s real preoccupation isn&apos;t the sex. Nor is it the politics. Nor is it the chance to bring back to life an era in Chinese history that is in danger of being forgotten. Like Brokeback Mountain, it is an emotionally charged story of a forbidden love. Lust, Caution may begin as an espionage thriller in which the politics and social history are foregrounded. By the final reel, though, it has turned into a full-blown weepie. At its core, this is a film about romantic obsession - &quot;doomed, impossible romantic love&quot;. The middle-aged director, who is happily married, grounded and emotionally stable, just can&apos;t help but be drawn to tales of amour fou. &quot;After Brokeback and this one, I do believe deeply inside that I am a romantic,&quot; Lee admits. &quot;I was never romantic in real life. That is why I have to make movies about it.&quot; \u00b7 Lust, Caution is released on January 4"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/15/hsbcholdingsbusiness.banking", "publicationDate": "2007-12-15T01:49:54Z", "tags": ["HSBC", "Banking", "Business", "Taiwan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The Taiwanese government is handing T$47.5bn (\u00a3750m) to HSBC to help it take control of a local bank, which was bailed out by the authorities just under a year ago.", "The deal allows HSBC to catch up with rivals, such as Standard Chartered and Citigroup, in Taiwan, which is regarded as a crucial market because of its proximity to the fast-growing Chinese economy.", "HSBC took part in an auction held by the Taiwanese government&apos;s Central Deposit Insurance Corporation, which took control of the Chinese Bank in January 2007.", "The Taiwanese bank collapsed and was taken into government hands when its parent company, the Rebar Group, ran into difficulties a year ago."], "title": "Taiwan gives HSBC \u00a3750m to take on Chinese bank", "article": "The Taiwanese government is handing T$47.5bn (\u00a3750m) to HSBC to help it take control of a local bank, which was bailed out by the authorities just under a year ago.

Japan believes it is a prime target for attacks from the communist state, which conducted more missile tests last July. &quot;This is very significant for Japanese national security,&quot; Nobutaka Machimura, Japan&apos;s top spokesman, said in Tokyo. &quot;The defence ministry and the government have been putting efforts into the development of ballistic missile defence, and we will continue to install the needed equipment and conduct exercises.&quot; The test, the first of its kind by any country other than the US, combined the US&apos;s Aegis detection and tracking system and a Standard Missile-3 [SM-3] interceptor made by the US defence firm Raytheon. The SM-3 interceptors will complement Japan&apos;s Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles [PAC-3], which are designed to intercept incoming missiles missed by the SM-3, to become part of a missile shield expected to cost up to 1 trillion yen. PAC-3 interceptors have already been deployed at two air bases near Tokyo, and there are plans to test them at other sites in the coming months."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/20/thecoldwarrageson", "publicationDate": "2007-12-20T20:00:00Z", "tags": ["Venezuela", "World news", "US news", "Americas"], "sentences": ["This is what happened to non-neoliberal South Korea and Taiwan."], "title": "The cold war rages on", "article": "Michael Reid paints a dismal picture of Venezuela and argues that the British left should support economic policies in Latin America that are &quot;building on the economic reforms misleadingly known as the Washington Consensus&quot;. He has a weak argument on both counts. Taking the &quot;Washington Consensus&quot; first - or neoliberalism as it is commonly called in Latin America - it is hard to imagine what would constitute economic failure if the neoliberal era in Latin America does not qualify. From 1980-2006, per capita income (or GDP) in the region has grown by about 14%. In just 20 years from 1960-1980, prior to the implementation of neoliberal reforms in most of the region, it grew by 82%. Reid cites Brazil, Mexico, and Chile as neoliberal success stories. But Chile is the only country in the hemisphere that has grown faster since 1980 than before. Brazil has averaged about 0.5% annual growth in per capita GDP over the last 26 years, as compared to the 123% cumulative growth from 1960-1980, before neoliberal policies were adopted. Mexico has also had very slow growth (about 17% per capita GDP growth from 1980-2006) compared to 99% from 1960-1980. It has also had sluggish growth since Nafta was implemented in 1993. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this unprecedented economic growth failure. Brazil and Mexico would have European living standards today if they had continued to grow at pre-1980 rates. This is what happened to non-neoliberal South Korea and Taiwan. Reid also tries to argue that the Venezuelan economy and the poor have done badly under Ch\u00e1vez. It is important to look not only at the whole nearly nine years of the Ch\u00e1vez administration, but also the four and half years since the government got control of the country&apos;s most vital industry: oil. Venezuela fares better than the rest of the region by either measure, but it has done remarkably well since the government got control over the oil industry in the first quarter of 2003. The economy (real GDP) has grown by 87%, creating about 1.8m jobs (nearly three times the rate of annual job creation during the current US expansion). Since the income share of the bottom quintile has grown during this period, the real - inflation-adjusted - income of the poor has grown considerably during this time. Although part of this growth was recovery from the devastating oil strike of December 2002-February 2003, the vast majority of it was not. And relatively little of the overall growth is oil production. Unemployment has fallen from 19.2% to 9.3% (first half of 2007). Reid notes the sharp decline in the poverty rate but complains that it is about what would be expected from Venezuela&apos;s growth. So what? Also, the official poverty rate does not take into account the vastly expanded access of poor people to healthcare or increased access to education. Reid cherry-picks a couple of stats to try to deny this reality, too: &quot;Some health indicators are worsening: government data show that the incidence of stunting and malnutrition in children rose slightly between 1999 and 2006.&quot; I could not find this statistic but if it is true, it is probably because most health indicators worsened significantly in 2002-2003, when the opposition oil strike that sought to topple the government caused a severe recession. The economy contracted by 24%, comparable to the worst years of the US great depression. But since 2003, health indicators have improved: for example, the (under one-year-old) infant mortality rate fell by 16 %; for infants between 28 days and 11 months, the decline is 35%. This is only for 2003-2005; they have almost certainly improved even more since then. Does he expect us to believe that most Venezuelans are not getting better healthcare, when the number of primary care physicians increased from 1,600 in 1998 to more than 19,000 today (mostly in poor areas)? Reid cites one study which argues that people did not learn to read in the government&apos;s large-scale literacy programme, but this is based on a household survey that asks a family member, &quot;Does he/she know how to read?&quot; It is quite possible for many hundreds of thousands of people to markedly improve their reading skills without much change in this type of data. The one study he cites showing increased income inequality, for which the underlying data is not available, is similarly inconclusive. His assumption that the democratically elected government of Venezuela is anti-democratic, and that the opposition is democratic, is a common media myth and has been refuted any number of times. Perhaps most ironic is Reid&apos;s charge that the left is still fighting the cold war. The opposite is true: it is the Bush administration, with help from a compliant media, that has sought to cast the new democracies in Latin America (including Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, and sometimes Argentina) in a cold war framework, refusing to respect the electorate&apos;s rejection of failed economic policies, or their democratic choices generally. It is a tribute to the sophistication of the British left that they can see through the fantastically one-sided media coverage of Venezuela and Latin America and understand the contribution that these new democracies are making to the region and the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/21/fooddrinks", "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T12:34:00Z", "tags": ["Food & drink industry", "Business"], "sentences": ["In 1998, the first Godiva store in Hong Kong opened, and it is now also present in Taiwan and Singapore."], "title": "Turkish firm rides off with Godiva chocolate", "article": "The luxury Belgian chocolatier Godiva, named after the legendary Lady Godiva, is to be bought by Turkish company Yildiz for $850m (\u00a3428m). Yildiz, the owner of \u00dclker Group, the largest consumer goods company in the Turkish food industry, agreed to acquire the brand from Campbell Soup. Campbell put Godiva up for sale in August, saying it did not fit with its strategy of focusing on simple meals like soup. Douglas R. Conant, Campbell&apos;s chief executive, said he was pleased with the price obtained for the chocolatier. He added: &quot;The agreement allows \u00dclker to expand and diversify its portfolio with an elite, global luxury brand and enables Campbell to sharpen our strategic focus on simple meals, anchored by soup, baked snacks, and vegetable-based beverages.&quot; Godiva has annual sales of around $500m. It has more than 270 retail shops in the US, Europe, and Asia and over 2,000 wholesale customers. It also has a direct-sales business through its website. The sale is expected to be completed in the next few months, ending more than 40 years of Campbell ownership of the chocolate brand. Godiva was founded in 1926 in Brussels by Joseph Draps. He named his chocolate company after Lady Godiva, a beautiful noblewoman married to the Earl of Mercia 10 centuries ago.  According to legend, she took pity on the people of Coventry, who were suffering under her husband&apos;s oppressive taxation. He said he would remit the tolls if she rode naked through the town which, according to legend, she did. The first Godiva shop outside Belgium was opened in Paris in 1958 on the upmarket street Rue du Faubourg St-Honor\u00e9. In 1966, Godiva made its North American debut at Wanamaker&apos;s in Philadelphia. In the same year, a controlling interest in the company was sold to Campbell, which later acquired the rest of the company. Godiva then expanded to Asia, with the first chocolates becoming available in Japan in central Tokyo in 1972. In 1998, the first Godiva store in Hong Kong opened, and it is now also present in Taiwan and Singapore."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2007/dec/21/asustekeeepcshipmentsbeat", "publicationDate": "2007-12-21T17:53:21Z", "tags": ["Open source", "Computing", "Gadgets", "Technology", "Asus"], "sentences": ["Asustek has shipped almost 350,000 units of the Eee PC in the quarter, ahead of the 300,000 estimated, according to Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes."], "title": "Asustek Eee PC shipments beat expectations", "article": "Asustek has shipped almost 350,000 units of the Eee PC in the quarter, ahead of the 300,000 estimated, according to Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes.

Taking the podium to collect the last of seven gongs, he startled the assembled industry executives by ending his acceptance speech with the cry: &apos;Go Taiwanese film!&apos; It was a moment of uncharacteristic exuberance from the acclaimed 53-year-old director, a &apos;shy human being&apos; who left his homeland for America 30 years ago to pursue a career in cinema against the wishes of his disciplinarian parents. Since then, Lee has followed an unconventional path to the top of the Hollywood tree, making cult movies in Cantonese and English that weren&apos;t always well-received before stumbling into the mainstream with the most unusual of them all, the mystical martial arts film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, that won three Oscars in 2000 and made him a household name. He followed that with Hulk, a critical and commercial flop that was panned by critics; the New York Times described it as: &apos;Incredible, but only in a negative sense: incredibly long, incredibly tedious, incredibly turgid.&apos; But Lee&apos;s adaptation of Annie Proulx&apos;s novel Brokeback Mountain, released two years ago, restored his status as a director of global importance, as well as winning him three more Academy Awards, and that reputation could be cemented still further this week, when Lust, Caution, a two-and-a-half-hour epic, opens in the UK. Set in 1940s Shanghai, the film is ostensibly a spy thriller about wartime espionage at the height of China&apos;s bitter conflict with the country&apos;s Japanese occupiers, but like Brokeback Mountain, it explores themes of sexuality and desire. Against the dramatic backdrop of the city&apos;s imposing colonial architecture, it tells the story of Wong Chia Chi, a young woman recruited by the resistance to seduce a collaborator, Mr Yee, who finds herself dangerously attracted to her prey. The puzzle for the film&apos;s protagonist and for audiences is to figure out where the deception ends and the genuine passion begins. Like his unconventional western that scandalised much of conservative America with its honest portrayal of a gay love affair, Lust, Caution is a controversial movie. Rumours of its sexually explicit scenes began to emerge from the set months before its release, and US censors handed it an NC-17 certificate, the equivalent of the old &apos;X&apos; classification. But although that will limit its audience, and the amount of money it makes, it is unlikely to diminish its impact, if only because its three carefully choreographed sex scenes are realistic enough for some American critics to wonder whether they may even be real. Lee insists they are staged and has defended them as &apos;pivotal parts of the story&apos;, but he has also said they were the most difficult he has ever shot. &apos;I&apos;m a shy human being. After half a day, we had to stop, it was so exhausting. To verbalise the feelings and lead the actors through those acts and witness how much they devote to it, it&apos;s very painful. Usually, we don&apos;t go there. I don&apos;t intend to go there again.&apos; Critics are divided about the film, which opened in America to mixed reviews in October. &apos;Lee is a true master,&apos; said Rolling Stone, &apos;and his potently erotic and suspenseful film casts a spell you won&apos;t want to break.&apos; Variety declared: &apos;Too much caution and too little lust squeeze much of the dramatic juice out of a two-and-half-hour period drama that&apos;s a long haul for relatively few returns.&apos; The film&apos;s restrictive rating means its distribution will be limited, but, unusually, Universal Pictures didn&apos;t press for cuts to be made to secure a better classification and a wider audience. &apos;They kept saying this year we have other films that will make money,&apos; according to Lee, a comment that demonstrates the immense industry clout the Chinese director now wields from his home in New York, far removed from the politics and power games of Hollywood. Married with two sons, Lee lives a stubbornly conventional family life, despite his wealth. He owns a four-bedroom house in the affluent New York commuter town of Larchmont, where he has lived since 1986, but his backyard is home to a chicken coop rather than a swimming pool, his children do not attend private schools and he rarely socialises with his &apos;showbiz friends&apos;. His close collaborator, Tim Squyres, the Oscar-winning editor who has worked with him on 10 of his 11 films, describes Lee as &apos;a quiet man&apos; and &apos;a normal suburban dad. He&apos;s very amiable in a quiet sort of way. He doesn&apos;t throw temper tantrums; he&apos;s not needy. He&apos;s not high maintenance. He&apos;s not one of those big Hollywood personalities who throws big parties at home at the weekend.&apos; When the two men where editing Lust, Caution in New York, Lee would often drop his youngest son Mason at school before arriving for work. A decade of shooting films overseas has taken him away from his family for long periods and he has expressed regret about missing his children&apos;s formative years, telling one interviewer recently: &apos;I feel bad. I missed [eldest son] Haan in a fencing competition. I missed all his games. I missed most of his teenage years.&apos; Born in the agricultural south of Taiwan, Lee&apos;s upbringing was unremarkable and there was little to suggest he would one day become the country&apos;s most famous cultural export. One of four children born to teachers who fled the mainland after the nationalists were routed by Mao Tse-Tung&apos;s communists, he fell in love with the cinema as a teenager and began consuming American films voraciously. &apos;He knows more about American westerns from the 1930s to the 50s than I do,&apos; Squyres says. &apos;He doesn&apos;t come from a traditional Chinese film background at all. Even his Chinese films don&apos;t feel foreign to Westerners because he&apos;s so suffused with a Western cinema sensibility. He certainly doesn&apos;t think of himself as part of any movement or tradition. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s an Ang Lee style of film.&apos; Teenage Lee skipped university, to the disappointment of his parents, to attend Taiwan&apos;s National Arts School, arriving in America to study theatre in Chicago and film in New York after completing his national service in 1979. After graduating, it was six years before he managed to land his first film, Pushing Hands, and his young family spent the ensuing period living off the income of his wife Jane Lin, now an assistant professor of pathology at New York Medical College. The experience has imbued him with a work ethic that has seen him produce almost a film a year since then. Lee&apos;s approach to film-making is equally disciplined, although some who have worked closely with him have complained he can be demanding. He shot more than seven hours of footage for Lust, Caution&apos;s opening three-minute scene, and actors are rarely mollycoddled. &apos;I would not call him nurturing,&apos; says Squyres. &apos;His approach to actors is not to make everyone happy and comfortable. He creates a certain amount of tension and discomfort.&apos; Kate Winslet, who starred in Emma Thompson&apos;s adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, which Lee directed, claims he asked actors to write essays about their characters before filming began. Not every Hollywood star is a fan, although others are said to enjoy the intellectual rigour he demands of them. Lee&apos;s career so far has been characterised by an uncanny knack of defying box-office logic, but not always for the better. Brokeback Mountain, which may prove to be his masterpiece, was conceived as a small movie with an art-house sensibility, but became a global hit, and Crouching Tiger found an audience few subtitled films ever reach, becoming the biggest grossing &apos;foreign&apos; film in history. But the comic-book romp Hulk was a cinematic miss that should have been a hit. It is too early to say how Lust, Caution will fare critically or commercially, but however it is received, Lee&apos;s standing in the film world is unlikely to be diminished and his popularity in his homeland will prove enduring. Although his octogenarian mother still lives in Taiwan, Lee is an infrequent visitor and his appearance at the Asian Oscars marked a rare return to a country where he is feted and revered in equal measure. According to Squyres, who accompanied him on the Taiwan trip: &apos;He was followed everywhere by the paparazzi. He&apos;s like a rock star over there.&apos; Typically, that is attention Ang Lee doesn&apos;t covet, preferring the anonymity of suburban America. &apos;Here I can live a normal life. In Taiwan, I&apos;d be like Michael Jordan walking down the street.&apos; The Ang Lee lowdown Born Chaochou in rural Taiwan, one of four children. His father, Sheng Lee, who died in 2004 at the age of 91, was the head teacher at Tainan First Senior High School, and his mother, who still lives in Taiwan, was also a teacher. Met his wife Jane Lin, a microbiologist, after moving to American to study theatre and film. They married in 1983 and have two sons, Haan, 23, and Mason, 17. Worst of times The critical panning for Hulk, his first major movie after the hugely successful Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The New Yorker described it as &apos;an earnest and laborious picture&apos;. Best of times Feted for his 2005 masterpiece Brokeback Mountain, which won three Academy Awards and elevated him to the A-list of Hollywood directors. What he says &apos;I&apos;m just a pretty regular dad. I basically drive Mason to his friends, pick them up, take them home.&apos; &apos;Truth can be painful and frightening ... it&apos;s uncomfortable, but I feel compelled to communicate with other people.&apos; &apos;I&apos;m a drifter and an outsider. There&apos;s not one single environment I can totally belong to. My cultural roots are something illusive.&apos; What others say &apos;I adore Ang Lee. I think he&apos;s a genius. So sweet, so humble and such a strong director at the same time as being such a gentle man. He&apos;s wonderful to be around.&apos; Actress Anne Hathaway."}]}
