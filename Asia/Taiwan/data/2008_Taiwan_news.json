The vessel, the 90,000-tonne LT Cortesia, had suddenly changed course and become beached on the Varne Bank, nine miles off Dover. Three commercial tug boats took an hour to pull the vessel off the sandbank before towing it to an anchorage, where it will be inspected before resuming its voyage. A spokesperson for the Marine and Coastguard Agency said the ship appeared watertight and in good condition. An emergency coastguard tug, the Anglian Monarch, was sent to the spot to assess damage, warn other vessels of the container&apos;s presence and to try to help pull the ship off the sandbank. The Cortesia, which had left Thamesport in Kent, was en route to east Asia via the Suez Canal. The coastguard said there was some hazardous material on board, though it was not known exactly what, but the vessel was stable and its hull appeared to be intact. None of the containers slipped from the ship, as happened when the vessel the MSC Napoli was deliberately beached in Devon a year ago in terrible weather. There were astonishing scenes then as hundreds descended on Branscombe beach to scavenge goods ranging from BMW motorcycles to packs of dog food. A Dover coastguard spokesman said it was a mystery why the LT Cortesia ran aground. &quot;We haven&apos;t a clue why. The vessel had come down normally, made an alteration to its route and then went aground. &quot;The weather has been fine and its traffic pattern was OK until the last minute when it went aground. Until we get to speak to the people on board to find out what happened, we will not know.&quot; LT Cortesia is owned by the German group Conti Reederei, which has a fleet of 77 vessels. It operates on Evergreen Line&apos;s China-Europe-Mediterranean service. The first the coastguard knew of the incident was when radar monitoring of the traffic separation zone in the Dover Strait, which keeps ships apart, indicated that the vessel had come to a sudden stop at the Varne Bank. The coastguard contacted the vessel, which was carrying 27 crew members, and the skipper confirmed that it was stuck on the sandbank. The ship is loaded with 42,785 tonnes of cargo in containers, some holding private possessions, others consignments of goods. The four-year-old ship was the largest vessel to dock at Thamesport, a busy container port, when she made her first trip there in 2005. On this voyage she had stopped in Le Havre, Hamburg and Rotterdam before reaching Thamesport. Her next stop was to be Port Said in Egypt and then Malaysia, Taiwan, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Dire strait The Dover Strait has long been regarded as a maritime graveyard. Sandbanks lie in wait along one of the busiest seaways in the world, used by more than 500 vessels daily. Traffic lanes were imposed after 20 Italian sailors on board the Vittoria Claudia died following a collision in 1953, but the safety measures did not prevent the fishing vessel Ocean Hound from being run down in the Dover Strait in 1991 with the loss of five lives. Heavy seas have also tormented sailors in the Dover Strait. In 2002 a Norwegian freight tanker, the Tricolor, sank with a \u00a321m cargo of luxury cars. The crew were rescued.

The scale of that economic achievement has blunted criticism of the democracy deficit that is in inverse proportion to the payment surplus. But it is legitimate to ask how the &quot;people&quot; are doing in the people&apos;s republic. China&apos;s disparities of wealth and power are now greater than anywhere else in the world, even though most of its trading partners are prepared to shrug off the poverty and lack of democracy as the inescapable cost of growth or of some mystic Confucian cultural trait. Ironically, across the straits, Taiwan shows that it is possible to combine prosperity and democracy, and indeed practice socialism - or at least European style social democracy - in a Chinese culture. Indeed we know it must be so, since Condoleezza Rice has just criticized Taiwan for wanting to hold a democratic referendum on its own future. This is a turnaround. For years, based on a traditional reflexive anti-communism, American rightists were vociferous supporters of Taiwan. Needless to say, a paleo-conservative such as John Bolton speaking on Taiwan&apos;s behalf does not really do much to win support for the island from the left, many of whom already suffer from a historical hangover based on their former support for the mainland&apos;s claims for international recognition against Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s defeated rump &quot;Republic of China&quot;, which had fled to the island. One has to wonder whether Bolton knows that Taiwan is more like one of the European social democracies that he and his conservative friends hate so much. Chiang has long gone and Taiwan is far more socialist in every real sense than the alleged &quot;people&apos;s&quot; republic, whose people get shot for joining unions, organising strikes, or voicing opinions their government does not like. With universal literacy, Taiwan has a vigorous and demanding media, free of the censorship and imprisonment that greets the unauthorised disclosure of information on the mainland. It is introducing a national pension scheme, even as Bolton&apos;s pals keep struggling to dismantle the US&apos;s social security system. It has unemployment insurance and social welfare programmes with none of the draconian welfare-for-work measures that Bill Clinton introduced under conservative pressure. To be fair, many on the left are just as hidebound as Bolton. In the old days, leftists of the kind that could overlook purges, gulags, mass famines and bullets in skulls could point to China&apos;s advances in literacy, healthcare and the &quot;iron rice bowl&quot; guaranteed for workers as &quot;actually existing socialism&quot;. To maintain that illusion, they now have to close their eyes not only to the lack of democracy and human rights in mainland China, but to the disappearance of medical services and social welfare programmes under the new post-Mao regime. Indeed, the untold millions of migratory workers whose muscles are fuelling Chinese economic expansion do not have the most elementary rights, not even the assured right to live in the cities in which they toil. Whatever passed for &quot;socialist&quot; in the Chinese Communist party agenda has been thrown overboard, to be replaced by a nationalist and militarist doctrine threatening to &quot;reunify&quot; Taiwan by force - whether its people like it or not. In fact, the Taiwanese clearly do not want it, as repeated elections have shown. In Taiwan, not only is Chiang dead, his old party introduced free elections, and lost them. Democratic socialists and supporters of democracy should support Taiwan in its bid for (social) democratic expression, free of the peculiar cocktail of unfettered capitalism and Beria-like political repression of the mainland. Certainly in the old Labour party sense, Taiwan is much redder than China - indeed, in terms of income distribution, its record is better than New Labour&apos;s. \u00b7 Ian Williams is the Nation&apos;s UN correspondent  ianwilliams.info"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jan/07/hotels.movies", "publicationDate": "2008-01-07T12:31:02Z", "tags": ["Hotels", "Travel", "London holidays", "Paris holidays", "Miami holidays", "Florence holidays", "Venice holidays", "Italy holidays", "France holidays", "Short breaks", "United Kingdom holidays", "Top 10s", "Cultural trips", "Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Grand Hotel, Taipei, from Eat, Drink, Man, Woman Ang Lee may be the toast of Hollywood with his latest espionage thriller, Lust, Caution but it was in his native Taiwan that he made his name."], "title": "Top 10 hotels from the movies", "article": "1. Les Rives de Notre Dame, Paris, from A Bout de Souffle Situated in the shade of the cathedral, Les Rives de Notre Dame is the Left Bank hotel immortalised in Jean-Luc Godard&apos;s breakthrough movie. A Bout de Souffle (Breathless) was almost entirely shot on location in Paris and Godard used the riverfront Hotel de Suede \u2013 as it was in 1959 \u2013 for most of the interplay between Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Seberg. The hotel has been refurbished but it is still perfect for that smouldering romantic weekend. \u00b7 Doubles from \u00a3167 a night 2. Degli Orafi, Florence, from a Room with a View Request room 414 when you book at the Degli Orafi in Florence and enjoy the view celebrated in Merchant-Ivory&apos;s adaptation of EM Forster&apos;s romantic novel. Room 414 was used as location for the film and it&apos;s the only one with a balcony. Once it yours, you can, as Forster wrote, &quot;fling wide the windows ... and lean out in sunshine with beautiful hills and trees and marble churches opposite, and, close below, The Arno, gurgling against the embankment of the road&quot;. \u00b7 Doubles from \u00a3218 3. Royal Station Hotel, Carnforth, from Brief Encounter She was a bored suburban housewife. He was a frustrated doctor. They may never have got it together, but you can still relive one of the most memorable moments in British cinematic history. The Royal Station Hotel in Carnforth, near Morecambe, is the perfect setting to evoke David Lean&apos;s masterful Brief Encounter as it is opposite the famous station and cafe where the film was set. The hotel, which briefly features in the film, offers a special Brief Encounter menu offering 1940s fare, including a &quot;Celia Johnson fish selection&quot;. \u00b7 Doubles on a B&amp;B basis from \u00a347 4. Grand Hotel, Rimini, from Fellini&apos;s Amarcord Federico Fellini&apos;s semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story revolves around the Grand Hotel in Rimini. When Fellini was a boy, he would press his nose through the gates of the hotel and dream of &quot;la dolce vita&quot;. Later, he learned to love the hotel from the inside, so much so that he spent much of his life there until he was taken gravely ill in one of its suites. Amarcord, a bawdy comedy about life growing up in fascist Rimini in the 1930s, won an Oscar for best foreign language film in 1974. \u00b7 Doubles from \u00a3119 5. Grand Hotel, Taipei, from Eat, Drink, Man, Woman Ang Lee may be the toast of Hollywood with his latest espionage thriller, Lust, Caution but it was in his native Taiwan that he made his name. Eat, Drink, Man, Woman (the third in a trilogy of films about the island) features a quartet of interlinking stories rotating around a chef at the Grand Hotel and his three daughters. The hotel itself, one of the finest in east Asia, boasts six restaurants, enough to fill the stomach of his most ardent admirers. \u00b7 Doubles from \u00a3109 6. Hotel Des Bains, Venice, from Death in Venice  Based on a novella by Thomas Mann, Death in Venice is largely set around the Hotel Des Bains on the east shore of Venice&apos;s Lido. The hotel is as lush and opulent as the movie itself. See also: The English Patient, where the hotel was used as a location for the &quot;Cairo&quot; hotel and Sergio Leone&apos;s Once Upon a Time in America, which was partly filmed next door at the Hotel Excelsior. \u00b7 Doubles from \u00a3226 7. Royal Lancaster Hotel, London, from The Italian Job The scene of Michael Caine&apos;s &quot;hiya Charlie&quot; moment takes place at the Royal Lancaster Hotel in Bayswater, London.

Neither assertion is without a measure of truth. Yet both obscure the major events that have rendered Pakistan unstable, even ungovernable, for at least two generations: the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979; the American decision to turn Pakistan into the frontline state for a global anti-Soviet jihad; and, more recently, the Bush administration&apos;s corralling of Pakistan into the so-called war on terror. Like many Asian countries, Pakistan stumbled from primeval chaos into postcolonial life, with an army as its strongest institution - which grew even more formidable after enlisting on the US side in the cold war. Six decades later, it is possible to see how in a less exacting climate Pakistan could have moved durably to civilian rule, as happened in Taiwan and Indonesia, two other pro-American dictatorships frozen by the cold war. Such, however, was the scale and intensity of the CIA&apos;s programme to arm the Afghan mujahideen that it couldn&apos;t but retard political processes in Pakistan. General Zia-ul-Haq, who faced disgrace domestically and internationally after his execution of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, abruptly became a prestigious ally in Washington and London. Emboldened by American patronage, Zia brutally suppressed all opposition, which included some of the country&apos;s greatest writers and artists. Pakistan&apos;s military strategists had long plotted to install a friendly regime in Afghanistan, which shares a fiercely autonomous and traditionally volatile Pashtun population with Pakistan. The CIA&apos;s generosity gave them the perfect opportunity to impose their will in Kabul through proxies like the warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who, like many Islamists feeding off US largesse, spent more time building private armies and bullying women than fighting the Soviets. Military officers seeking revenge for their humiliation by India in the war over Bangladesh in 1971 redirected US resources more radically to anti-India insurgencies in Punjab and Kashmir. Pursuing their separate agenda, western cold war adventurers and their local allies deeply damaged Pakistan&apos;s frail society. Three million Afghan, mostly Pashtun, refugees poured into Pakistan, along with cheap guns and drugs. Furthermore, political Islam - until then a marginal force in Pakistani politics - acquired buoyancy, and a radical edge, from the anti-communist jihad in Afghanistan. Pakistan knew a spell of civilian rule after Zia&apos;s death in 1988. But elected leaders such as Benazir Bhutto could hardly supervise, let alone restrict, the cherished ventures of the all-powerful military intelligence elite, such as the backing of the Pashtun-dominated Taliban in Afghanistan&apos;s destructive civil war, and the training of extremists for jihad in Kashmir. The US cancelled its aid programme to Pakistan before the last Soviet soldier left Afghanistan in 1989; it went on to impose sanctions on Pakistan for its nuclear programme. Visiting Pakistan in early 2001, I was struck by the anger Pakistanis of all classes expressed toward the US. Far from being a generalised Islamist hatred of American women wearing miniskirts, anti-US sentiment was rooted in particular grievances. Diplomats and ex-generals raged against US selfishness in leaving Pakistan to sort out the post-Soviet mess in Afghanistan; journalists and NGO workers described in anguished tones how the CIA-sponsored jihad strangled Pakistan&apos;s democracy, endowing the military intelligence establishment with a sinister extra-constitutional authority. In late 2001, George Bush&apos;s resolve to eliminate al-Qaida and the Taliban with the help of the very same establishment inaugurated another cycle in which Pakistan&apos;s long-delayed tryst with civilian rule would be again postponed by US priorities in neighbouring Afghanistan. It is clearer now that Pervez Musharraf&apos;s promises to the US could only be empty, no matter how sincerely he believed in them. Military and intelligence officers who had staked their careers on making reliable Pashtun friends were unlikely to launch more than a few token assaults on the Pak-Afghan borderlands, which even the British Indian Army couldn&apos;t subdue. Nevertheless, the Bush administration has persisted for almost seven years in the hope that the Pakistani military could be bullied or bribed into scoring successes in the global war on terror. Many generals and spies probably couldn&apos;t believe their luck as they received billions of US dollars for yet another phoney war. Paranoid western visions of crazy Islamists getting hold of Pakistani nukes ensured a steady flow of cash, which, as the New York Times recently revealed, the military mostly spent on objectives not remotely resembling those drawn up in Washington. In any case, the Taliban and their sympathisers can&apos;t be &quot;eliminated&quot;. The web of strategic tribal and ethnic alliances has represented the strongest Pashtun claims in recent decades as traditional rulers of Afghanistan&apos;s ethnic mosaic. Even today, as the writer Rory Stewart has pointed out, &quot;many Pashtun clearly prefer the Taliban to foreign troops&quot;. In actuality, the Taliban can only be contained. But even that may remain a fantasy if foreign occupation continues to radicalise Pashtuns in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Musharraf has himself only just escaped assassination. Even though he grudgingly accepted Washington&apos;s choice, Bhutto, as a civilian facade for military rule, he can&apos;t be unaware that Pakistan&apos;s stability depends on successful deal-making in the Pashtun heartland rather than in the White House. This lesson is not entirely lost on western policymakers. EU diplomats expelled from southern Afghanistan a day before Bhutto&apos;s assassination were trying to reach out to the Taliban. But such peacemakers face their most influential adversaries among those who think that errant natives respond best to a bit of stick. Writing in the Wall Street Journal last week, the Tory MP Michael Gove warned the west not to betray any &quot;sign of weakness&quot; to the Taliban. Doubtless the Churchill wannabes that have proliferated since 9/11 would fight on their laptops to the last drop of Afghan and Pakistani blood. Intoxicated by their own cliches, they remain blind to how their warmongering in the cause of democracy in Afghanistan and Pakistan has boosted the most militaristic elements there, ruining even the basic hope of a violence-free life, not to mention the grand ambition of democracy. The CIA&apos;s anti-Soviet jihad not only ensured the dominance of the military intelligence establishment over elected government in Pakistan; it also spawned a new radical force, which now menaces military as well as civilian authority in Pakistan. We may praise or blame Benazir Bhutto for what she did or did not do, but as long as Pakistan remains hostage to failed western policies those aspiring to lead it can achieve little apart from personal power - along with a high risk of martyrdom.  \u00b7 Pankaj Mishra is the author of Temptations of the West: How to be Modern in India, Pakistan and Beyond kannauj@gmail.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/jan/08/schools.uk1", "publicationDate": "2008-01-08T23:44:41Z", "tags": ["Schools", "Education", "UK news"], "sentences": ["In maths and/or science, they are joined by Australia, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Taiwan, Macao and Japan."], "title": "Peter Mortimore on the decline of the UK's Pisa scores", "article": "The results of the third phase of Pisa (Programme for International Student Assessment) make interesting reading. Every three years, Pisa tests 400,000 15-year-olds from 54 countries in reading, maths and science. Like all international assessments, Pisa has methodological and statistical limitations. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), however, uses elaborate procedures to ensure that the sampling of students and schools is fair and that like is being compared with like. The tests are not related to any specific curricula but are based on the knowledge and skills young people need in the modern world. The Pisa results provide lots of information about the efficacy of national education systems. How good they are, however, also depends on what happens to the young people after 15. Some countries, such as Norway and Denmark, perform only at average or below in Pisa but, aided by good upper-secondary schooling, still produce well-educated young adults. The UK has participated in all three phases of Pisa. In 2000, British performance - seventh place in reading, eightth in maths and fourth in science - was welcomed by Tony Blair. The 2003 results were hardly discussed because the UK sample was too small for the OECD to be certain that it was truly representative, and the results were omitted from the published report. Subsequent statistical analyses, however, revealed that the sample was slightly better than &quot;representative&quot;. The results, which showed a decline on 2000, might have been worse had the sample been normal. The latest stage has received remarkably little press coverage, and yet it confirms the decline from 2000. In reading, the UK average score dropped from 523 in 2000 to 495 - only just above the OECD average. In maths, the fall is from 529 to 495 - below the OECD average. In science, the slippage is less marked - from 532 to 515, still well above the OECD average. The wide confidence intervals of the scores do not allow any certainty but they suggest a downward trend over the past seven years. Furthermore, the UK results show relatively large gaps between the scores for the 95th percentile (highest scoring) and the fifth percentile (lowest scoring) groups except in maths. In contrast, Finland not only achieves high average scores (the highest in maths and science and second only to Korea in reading) but also has some of the smallest spreads of scores. Its education system is both high achieving and highly equitable. Canada, Hong Kong and New Zealand perform well in reading. In maths and/or science, they are joined by Australia, Switzerland, Netherlands, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Taiwan, Macao and Japan. All the scores for France are below the OECD averages, have large spreads and are tending to decline. Germany and Sweden do a little better. Poland is at the average and is improving. Denmark does well only in maths. US students do not do well. The suggested decline of the UK scores - in contrast to the rising trends of national Sats and GCSEs - raises questions about the direction of educational policy in England over the past 10 years. Have teachers been conditioned into &quot;teaching to our tests&quot; rather than promoting pupils&apos; broader knowledge and skills? (The separate results for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland need to be considered in relation to their increasingly different systems). Is it time to question whether a test-dominated, market-based system - which now includes a proposal from Lord Adonis that league tables show proportions of high achieving pupils - is the best way to achieve world-class education? Perhaps the government should consider some more radical ideas, influenced by the Finnish system, proposed by the National Union of Teachers in its pamphlet A Good Local School for Every Child and for Every Community. If we aspire to Finland&apos;s excellent results, it would be a good idea to reflect on how they have been achieved."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/09/yearofthechinamodel", "publicationDate": "2008-01-09T07:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The same thing could happen in China, where national pride constantly teeters on the edge of belligerence towards Japan, Taiwan, and ultimately the west."], "title": "Year of the 'China model'", "article": "It will be China&apos;s year in 2008. The Olympic games - no doubt perfectly organised, without a protester, homeless person, religious dissenter, or any other kind of spoilsport in sight - will probably bolster China&apos;s global prestige. While the American economy gets dragged down further in a swamp of bad property debts, China will continue to boom. Exciting new buildings, designed by the world&apos;s most famous architects, will make Beijing and Shanghai look like models of 21st century modernity. More Chinese will be featured in annual lists of the world&apos;s richest people. And Chinese artists will command prices at international art auctions that others can only dream of. To come back from near destitution and bloody tyranny in one generation is a great feat, and China should be saluted for it. But China&apos;s success story is also the most serious challenge that liberal democracy has faced since fascism in the 1930s. This is not because China poses a great military threat - war with the United States, or even Japan, is only a fantasy in the minds of a few ultra-nationalist cranks and paranoiacs. It is in the realm of ideas that China&apos;s political-economic model, regardless of its environmental consequences, is scoring victories and looking like an attractive alternative to liberal democratic capitalism. And it is a real alternative. Contrary to what some pundits say, Chinese capitalism is not like 19th-century European capitalism. True, the European working class, not to mention women, did not have voting rights 200 years ago. But even during the most ruthless phases of western capitalism, civil society in Europe and the US was made up of a huge network of organisations independent of the state - churches, clubs, parties, societies, and associations that were available to all social classes. In China, by contrast, while individuals have regained many personal freedoms since the death of Maoism, they are not free to organise anything that is not controlled by the Communist Party. Despite communism&apos;s ideological bankruptcy, China has not changed in this regard. The China model is sometimes described in traditional terms, as though modern Chinese politics were an updated version of Confucianism. But a society where the elite&apos;s pursuit of money is elevated above all other human endeavours is a far cry from any kind of Confucianism that may have existed in the past. Still, it&apos;s hard to argue with success. If anything has been laid to rest by China&apos;s rising wealth, it is the comforting idea that capitalism, and the growth of a prosperous bourgeoisie, will inevitably lead to liberal democracy. On the contrary, it is precisely the middle class, bought off by promises of ever-greater material gains, that hopes to conserve the current political order. It may be a Faustian bargain - prosperity in exchange for political obedience - but so far it has worked. The China model is attractive not only to the country&apos;s new coastal elites, but has global appeal. African dictators - indeed, dictators everywhere - who walk the plush red carpets laid out for them in Beijing - love it. For the model is non-western, and the Chinese do not preach to others about democracy. It is also a source of vast amounts of money, much of which will end up in the tyrants&apos; pockets. By proving that authoritarianism can be successful, China is an example to autocrats everywhere, from Moscow to Dubai, from Islamabad to Khartoum. China&apos;s appeal is growing in the western world as well. Businessmen, media moguls, and architects all flock there. Could there be a better place to do business, build stadiums and skyscrapers, or sell information technology and media networks than a country without independent trade unions or any form of organised protest that could lower profits? Meanwhile, concern for human or civic rights is denigrated as outmoded, or an arrogant expression of western imperialism. There is, however, a fly in the ointment. No economy keeps growing at the same pace forever. Crises occur. What if the bargain struck between the Chinese middle classes and the one-party state were to fall apart, owing to a pause, or even a setback, in the race for material wealth? This has happened before. The closest thing, in some ways, to the China model is 19th-century Germany, with its industrial strength, its cultivated but politically neutered middle class, and its tendency toward aggressive nationalism. Nationalism became lethal when the economy crashed, and social unrest threatened to upset the political order. The same thing could happen in China, where national pride constantly teeters on the edge of belligerence towards Japan, Taiwan, and ultimately the west. Aggressive Chinese nationalism could turn lethal, too, if its economy were to falter. This would not be in anyone&apos;s interest, so we should wish China well in 2008, while sparing a thought for all the dissidents, democrats, and free spirits languishing in labour camps and prisons. We should hope that they will live to see the day when the Chinese, too, will be a free people. It might be a distant dream, but dreaming is what a New Year is all about.

The Bank&apos;s global economic prospects report for 2008 says that resilience in emerging economies such as China and India will play a central role in cushioning the current slowdown as those countries are taking over the baton of growth in the world economy. The importance of developing countries is also highlighted today by Lord (Digby) Jones, minister of state for trade and investment, who is urging mid-sized British businesses to look for fresh trading opportunities in new high-growth markets. However, the World Bank study warned that the weaker dollar, increasing volatility in financial markets and the prospect of an American recession presented risks to the soft landing scenario for the global economy. The report predicts that the housing-market led slump in the US, which began last year, will continue this year and get worse in 2009. The report forecasts that world economic growth will slow modestly this year to 3.3% from 3.6% last year. This is markedly down from the 3.9% seen in 2006 and driven by slower expansion in high-income countries such as the US and Britain - the world&apos;s fifth largest economy. On a purchasing power parity basis, which reflects differences in incomes, growth is down to 4.9% from 5.2% last year. In contrast, rapidly developing economies such as China and India are helping to prop up the world economy through reserves built up in past years.  &quot;We expect developing-country growth to moderate only somewhat over the next two years,&quot; said Uri Dadush, director of the World Bank&apos;s developing prospects group and international trade department. &quot;However a much sharper US slowdown is a real risk that could weaken medium-term prospects in developing countries.&quot; A downturn in the American economy could hit export revenues and capital dollar-investments for developing countries, the report said, making it less likely that these economies will be able to withstand gloomier times ahead. Despite concerns of more subdued US imports, the World Bank says continued strong spending by oil-exporting countries and firm expansion in China and India will keep developing country growth at 7% or more this year and next. So far, growth among low and middle-income economies eased by just 0.1 percentage point in 2007 from the robust 7.5% recorded in 2006. Countries such as Algeria and Iran, which export oil, have enjoyed strong rates of growth on the back of soaring crude prices, which last week set a new high of more than $100 a barrel. Meanwhile, the emergence of the middle classes in China and India has stimulated strong domestic demand in those countries. Overall, careful economic planning and far-reaching technological progress have been vital in increasing productivity in the developing world and raising income growth over the past 15 years, the study shows. These factors are expected to enable these nations to make annual per capita income gains of 3.9% over the next 10 years and 3.4% in the decade after. These projections are twice as fast as those for high-income countries. The World Bank said such growth could reduce the number of people living on less than a dollar a day from 1.2 billion in 1990 and 970 million in 2004 to 624 million by 2015. But the Bank&apos;s outlook pointed to many threats that could alter its forecasts. The financial turbulence seen last year could re-emerge if the US housing market continues to crumble and prices fall even further. The report echoed the concerns of many analysts, saying that a serious slump in the US housing market could tip the US into recession, leading to further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, in turn fuelling a slide in the dollar. This could potentially destabilise global markets.  &quot;Financial imbalances would increase rather than recede,&quot; the report said. &quot;Such a scenario could sow the seeds of a much sharper slowdown in the medium term and illustrates the current challenge facing monetary authorities in both high-income and developing countries.&quot; In addition, more volatility in financial markets may lead to significantly tighter lending conditions which would have grim consequences for investment and growth in developing economies. But so far the credit crisis has had a limited impact on emerging economies, the study notes. The World Bank predicts that the credit crunch will persist until the end of this year. However, the report forecasts that the 30-country strong Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will see a recovery next year as returning stability in financial markets helps revive consumer and business confidence. Meanwhile growth in the US is expected to slip to 1.9% this year, owing to weak domestic demand, from an annualised rate of 4.9% in the third quarter of 2007. While the study warned of the dangers of a weaker dollar for the rest of the world economy, it added that this, combined with softer US growth, would help boost exports for the world&apos;s largest economy, helping to plug the black hole in the US current account.  The deficit hit a high of 6.6% in 2006 and is expected to drop to 5% in 2009. &quot;Strong import demand across the developing countries is helping to sustain global growth,&quot; said Hans Timmer, co-author and manager of the global trends team at the World Bank. &quot;As a result, and given a cheaper US dollar, American exports are expanding rapidly. This is helping shrink the US current account deficit and is contributing to a decline in global imbalances.&quot; Moreover, the report said the integration of developing countries into global markets and their rising share in world trade had helped dampen inflation through increased international competition. Call to seek new markets British firms are urged to seek new business in high-growth markets today by Digby Jones, pictured, the minister for trade and investment. Jones stresses that Brazil, Russia, India and China are not the only rapidly emerging markets that UK companies can benefit from. He said several high-growth markets, such as Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey, had been identified. In south-east Asia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and South Korea were singled out, while in the Middle East, the priorities are Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. &quot;There are huge commercial opportunities in these emerging markets. They are growing at 6% to 12% annually, compared with an average of 2% to 3% in the OECD,&quot; Jones said. &quot;There are thousands of mid-sized companies in Britain that have the ability and experience to export to high-growth markets but are not aware of the commercial opportunities or how business is conducted there.&quot; He said emerging markets were crucial to the UK&apos;s response to globalisation. &quot;These markets are expected to be a major source of both trade and foreign direct investment,&quot; he said. &quot;UK Trade &amp; Investment is transferring more than \u00a35m of its resources from mature developed markets to focus on the high-growth markets.&quot; Countries such as Mexico and Vietnam have invested vast amounts in ports, rail and roads.

They drift around the Southern ocean and are piled high on the beaches of Nova Zemlaya to the north of Russia after being swept thousands of miles on the Gulf stream. But the end may now be in sight for the flimsiest of plastic bags after China pledged to ban them from June. China&apos;s decision this week means it has joined an accelerating number of countries, states and cities taking action against the plastic litter that has accompanied rapid urban growth and increasing wealth. The bags have contributed to floods and health problems in many countries, blocking drains and providing perfect pools of warm water for mosquitoes and other insects to breed rapidly. Yesterday shopkeepers in Beijing, who hand out 2bn bags a year, were sanguine about the prospect of no longer wrapping everything in plastic so thin that it can only be used once, and of paying a small tax on all other plastic bags. &quot;No one has said anything to us about it yet, but I guess they will in June when the rule starts. I think it will be inconvenient but we&apos;ll just charge for them. I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll get used to it,&quot; said Wang Jing, a sales assistant at a 24-hour supermarket. A cashier at a large supermarket said that the ban might be a good thing. &quot;We are probably giving out about 10,000 plastic bags a day. Customers often complain that they are poor quality; we have to use two bags most of the time. No one minds about this because the bags are so cheap. But I think customers might be willing to pay a bit more for better quality.&quot;  China took a lead from Hong Kong, which used to produce 8bn bags a year but after numerous &quot;no plastic&quot; days and voluntary bans introduced a bill to impose a levy on plastic bags. It emerged yesterday that Chinese officials had also consulted Bangladesh, the first large country to ban bags, in 2002, after they were identified as a leading cause of severe flooding.  Advice &quot;They came to us informally to ask our advice,&quot; said Dr Atiq Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, a development thinktank.  The centre had being among organisations pressing the Bangladeshi government to close down dozens of small scale plastic bag makers and impose a country-wide ban. But although the government closed the factories and stopped the bags being made, they have crept back in and the ban has proved almost impossible to police.  &quot;The trouble is the plastic bag is an integral part of life. We have learned that to say absolutely no to them is not an option. Most supermarkets and small shops now use paper bags, but there is still a demand for the very flimsy ones. Now they are smuggled in from India. The beauty of China is that if they decide to do something, they will,&quot; said Rahman. At least 40 countries, states and major cities have imposed, or are considering, bans. According to the UN environment programme based in Nairobi, the plastic problem is now &quot;on the agenda of almost every African country&quot;. Rwanda and Eritrea have banned the bags outright; Tanzania has stopped all imports as well as the manufacture of bags, and flimsy plastic drinking water containers; Kenya is in the process of prohibiting them and South Africa, which once produced 7bn bags a year, has prohibited bags thinner than 30 microns (one micron is one-thousandth of a millimetre). In many cases the bans have not proved effective. A ban on the use of thin plastic bags in Uganda has been widely ignored. The growing global rejection of the bag is now reaching some of the remotest parts of the world. Papua New Guinea, Bhutan, Zanzibar and Botswana have all banned bags and introduced taxes. At least six Indian states, including Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh, have bans or are considering them.  Densely populated Taiwan, which is running out of landfill space, has not only banned bags but has stopped fast food restaurants and supermarkets issuing plastic knives, forks and cups. The local plastics industry, which has been producing 20bn bags a year, says it expects to see 50,000 jobs lost. Attitudes are now changing fast in industrialised countries. Ireland took the lead in Europe in 2002 with a tax, Australia is planning to impose a federal ban this year, and San Francisco and Oakland in California are forcing shops to use bags made of at least 40% high-grade recycled paper. This week New York passed a law forcing large stores to provide bins for recycling plastic bags. Meanwhile the 33 London councils are planning to introduce a law banning the ultra thin, single-use bags next year and imposing a tax on others. The global plastics industry, estimated to make and distribute between 500bn and a trillion bags a year, has fought back, arguing that plastics are getting more compact and take up less space in landfills. It says that paper bags require more energy to produce, generate more waste and burn less cleanly. Fighting back In a statement on its website yesterday the Society of the Plastics Industry, which represents 2,000 plastic manufacturers in the US, said environmental activists and non-government organisations &quot;have promoted a specific agenda and retailers have been too quick to give in to the outcries of alarmist special interest groups&quot;. &quot;Whoever wants to save the planet on this one is off the planet because it won&apos;t,&quot; Richard Evans, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, told journalists yesterday. &quot;Supermarkets are already reducing their use of plastic bags by 50%. Plastic bags are a part of our lives - if we replace them we are going to replace them with paper and where&apos;s the paper going to come from. Do we cut down more trees ... do we increase greenhouse gases?&quot; Back in Beijing a kiosk owner was optimistic. &quot;I don&apos;t think the police will come here and stop me issuing bags. It might be a good thing for me if the customers have to pay for them. I just buy them from a shop down the road.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/13/afghanistan.theobserver", "publicationDate": "2008-01-13T02:18:21Z", "tags": ["World news", "Afghanistan", "Middle East and North Africa"], "sentences": ["Associated Press Pro-China party wins landslide poll victory Taiwan&apos;s opposition Nationalist Party won a landslide victory in legislative elections yesterday, boosting its policy of closer engagement with China two months before a presidential poll it now seems poised to win.", "Chen Shui-bian, who has been criticised for aggravating relations with China by promoting moves to formalise Taiwan&apos;s independence, resigned as chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party as its defeat became clear, though he remains President."], "title": "World news in brief", "article": "Fifty-two die and 17 missing in freak snows Recent snow and cold have killed more than 52 people in western Afghanistan and another &apos;17 others are missing in Ghoryan and Shindand districts&apos;, according to a spokeswoman for Herat&apos;s governor.

But amid the glamour of the announcement, some of its charms may have gone unnoticed. The invention is a nod to ancient methods of capturing animals in a forest, and also to the fanciful adaptation of those techniques in early cops-and-robbers movies. Hsieh&apos;s patent sums it up in a terse 94 words: &quot;A net trapping system for capturing a robber immediately is used in a place of business such as a bank. The device looks like a storing box and is installed above the entrance of the business. When a robbery takes place and the system is activated, an infrared detecting device determines if a robber is in a zone beneath the storing box. A net, a curtain, and a plurality of barriers will drop down immediately and simultaneously. After a lifting motor is activated, the system traps the robber and suspends him above the floor.&quot; Prior to the Ig Nobel ceremony, we were unable to find Hsieh. Attempts to contact him by telephone, by letter, and even by visits to his home address in the city of Taichung, Taiwan, all failed. Fears arose that maybe the poor man had become trapped inside his own invention. Happily, newspaper accounts of the ceremony reached him, and we have now learned, via journalists in Taiwan, that Hsieh runs a security company, that he is a former commander of an amphibian frogman unit, that he once set up similar traps underwater to capture swimming Chinese spies, and that he is diligently trying to market his machinery to banks. Hsieh&apos;s patent has had at least one recorded effect: it inspired Zoltan Egeresi in the fight against terrorists. Two years after New York and Washington were attacked by hijacked planes, Egeresi, a Californian inventor, filed a patent application for an &quot;anti-hijacking system&quot;. In an ingenious commingling of ideas, Egeresi adapted the Hsieh bank-robber-trapping technology as a way to simplify a rather costly anti-hijacker system devised in the early 1970s by Gustano A Pizzo. Pizzo&apos;s invention, described here last week, drops a hijacker through trapdoors, seals him into a package, then drops the encapsulated hijacker through the plane&apos;s bomb bay doors, whence he parachutes to earth. Here is Egeresi&apos;s description of his simple, cheap, Pizzo-ian, Hsieh-ian hybrid invention: &quot;When one or more person [sic] is trying to overpower the pilots, this anti-hijacking system can provide a non-lethal last line of defence. Doors on the cockpit may not be penetration-proof. When pilot or flight attendant is confronted with a situation where the pilot&apos;s door is about to be penetrated, a concealed stainless steel net from below the carpet will hoist up all people to the ceiling.&quot; \u00b7 Marc Abrahams is editor of the bimonthly Annals of Improbable Research and organiser of the Ig Nobel Prize"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/jan/16/art.artsfunding", "publicationDate": "2008-01-16T09:17:30Z", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Arts funding", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Brett RogersDirector, The Photographers&apos; Gallery As a not-famous artist who has toured India, Taiwan and Lebanon conducting drawing lectures and workshops representing the UK via the British Council, I know that not only the great and the good of the art world and those attending such illustrious events as the Venice Biennale are affected by and welcome the British Council&apos;s excellent and innovative projects."], "title": "Letters: Bedding-in British Council cuts", "article": "Martin Davidson&apos;s response (Letters, January 15) to the anxieties raised by many leading artists and others concerning the future of the arts departments at the British Council is disingenuous. There is no dispute with an organisation&apos;s need to review its operations from time to time. However, why, if the council is &quot;initiating a consultation on arts strategy&quot;, have staff already been told of the dissolution of individual departments (in the week before Christmas) and jobs already been advertised, with appointments to be made to a new multidisciplinary project on January 29? Where is the consultation process when the individual advisory board have already been abolished? Far from allaying concerns, such pernicious economy with the truth only serves to amplify them and needs to be challenged. Richard DeaconLondon Martin Davidson says his organisation is reviewing its future. He also says that it is committed to offering the world the best of UK art. There is no such thing in art as &quot;best&quot; in a culture that goes in for unmade beds and cows cut in half. The British Council needs to free itself from the influence of a small group of powerful commercial galleries and widen its horizons to embrace art that is not fashion-led. There are some very fine UK artists who remain overlooked and under promoted. Go looking for them. Professor Barry FantoniLondon I find it hard to share the dismay of the group of usual suspects and regular beneficiaries who signed the letter about the British Council (January 12). As one who has never made it on to the approved-artist list of the Arts Council, the British Council or most of the other institutions of state patronage, and yet managed to survive and exhibit in this country and abroad for more than 25 years, I can confirm that some of us have been obliged to get along without the support of these institutions. John KeaneLondon As a former deputy director of visual arts at the British Council (1997-2005), I am concerned about the devastating consequences of the plans to dismantle the various arts departments of the British Council. Alongside its promotion of British artists abroad, the visual arts department has nurtured an influential generation of curators and directors. In the 1980s and 90s it employed curators of the calibre of Teresa Gleadowe (founding director of the curating course, Royal College of Art); Lewis Biggs (founding director, Liverpool Biennale) and Gill Hedley (former director of the Contemporary Art Society). As a consequence of the damaging changes being proposed, the department over recent years has suffered a devastating loss of expertise - Ann Gallagher to Tate, Caroline Douglas to the Arts Council Collection and me to The Photographers&apos; Gallery. Brett RogersDirector, The Photographers&apos; Gallery As a not-famous artist who has toured India, Taiwan and Lebanon conducting drawing lectures and workshops representing the UK via the British Council, I know that not only the great and the good of the art world and those attending such illustrious events as the Venice Biennale are affected by and welcome the British Council&apos;s excellent and innovative projects. It cannot be stated highly enough the respect its wide range of arts programmes bring to the UK. None would take place without the initiatives put so well in place by the council&apos;s visual arts department. What possible rationale can there be for disbanding art departments at the British Council? Leo DuffKingston University The news that the British Council intends to do away with its arts departments is indeed a matter for concern. The collection of paintings of the Ashington Group has been housed at Woodhorn Colliery Museum since 1989, but its earlier history includes a tour to China in 1980, under the auspices of the council. Perhaps this collection was a modest participant in its work, but it created an impact on the other side of the world.

Indeed Gordon Brown talked before leaving London about the need for Britain and China to coordinate their positions on issues such as &quot;global security and world economic development&quot;, on Darfur, Burma and North Korea, and on China-EU as well as China-British relations. And Chinese reports today of the meeting between Brown and premier of the Chinese state council, Wen Jiabao, talk about a &quot;comprehensive strategic partnership&quot;. But it needs serious diplomacy if this is not to be just an empty phrase. It is in the context of such a broader dialogue too that Britain should raise the critical issues highlighted by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other human rights organisations. Diplomatic ways can be found to say that, nearly 20 years after Tiananmen Square, China is still failing (in the words of Amnesty&apos;s Kate Allen) &quot;to honour the promises it made, when bidding for the Olympics, to improve human rights. It still locks up dissidents, shuts down opposition websites and executes more people every year than the rest of the world put together.&quot; These larger issues will be drowned out, on a brief visit, by the trade pitch that seems designed mainly for domestic British consumption - to demonstrate that Gordon is winning British jobs. And in the shadow of Northern Rock there is an additional hope - to rescue the falling reputation of Britain&apos;s financial market by soliciting investment from China&apos;s cash-rich sovereign wealth funds. Trade and markets have their own logic that these days even in China is only affected on the margins by government decisions. Amazingly, we are told that Brown and Wen have agreed to &quot;increase trade between the two countries by 50% by 2010&quot; - which would be an unheard-of rate of increase ever in China&apos;s trade with any European country. Chairman Brown, it appears, has embraced not a five-year plan but a two-year plan to make Britain China&apos;s &quot;number one business destination&quot;. The People&apos;s Daily today, in its commentary on Brown&apos;s visit, praises British diplomacy for &quot;its relatively steady and reasonable characteristics&quot; and says that the British prime minister will show &quot;correct&quot; judgment by backing Beijing&apos;s line on Taiwan. Decoded, this means that China knows it will be given an easy ride on the sensitive issues which bolder diplomacy might raise. Of course Brown is entitled to try to sell British business, but not if it becomes a sellout of vital human rights and international concerns."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jan/18/tennis.australianopen2008", "publicationDate": "2008-01-18T12:30:03Z", "tags": ["Sport", "Tennis", "Australian Open 2008", "Australian Open", "Serena Williams", "Australia sport"], "sentences": ["She will now face No12 seed Nicole Vaidsova in the next round after the Czech saw of Japan&apos;s Ai Sugiyama in straight sets, while Henin will meet the winner of the third-round clash between France&apos;s Aravane Rezai and Taiwan&apos;s Hsieh Su-wei."], "title": "Australian Open: Mauresmo shot down by Dellacqua Henin and Serena through", "article": "Former champion and 18th seed Amelie Mauresmo has made a shock exit in the third round of the Australian Open, beaten by home favourite Casey Dellacqua 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.

Roy Cropper spent most of this summer trying to lower his footprint in his caf\u00e9, Roy&apos;s Rolls - looking at everything from sourcing food locally to the fact that his plates had been shipped from Taiwan. Green concerns raced up the consumer agenda in 2007, forcing a fundamental change in the way companies communicate with their customers. The result is that so-called &quot;green marketing&quot; is now one of the fastest growing areas of the sector and is creating both new jobs and rewriting the ground rules for current ones. The discipline offers brands the opportunity to show customers their green credentials but also carries the potential to influence consumers&apos; behaviour for the better, and to feed back to management and boards on issues that are important to consumers. Everyone seems to be embracing the trend - from fast-moving consumer goods giants such as Procter &amp; Gamble, with a campaign for Ariel detergent encouraging consumers to wash their clothes at 30C instead of 40C, to boutique brands such as smoothie maker Innocent Drinks, which will start a campaign this month emphasising the good provenance of its ingredients and the fact that its bottles are now made from 100% recycled plastic. Greg Nugent, head of brand, product and UK marketing for Eurostar, says green marketing is now an imperative rather than a choice. &quot;In the last 18 months the whole climate change debate has gone from being a science community issue to the front page of the tabloids. It was clear from market research we commissioned that consumers expected companies to take action on environmental issues. We simply believe that those who don&apos;t will be left behind.&quot; Eurostar found the return rail trip to Paris or Brussels from London generated 10 times fewer carbon emissions than the equivalent flight. Despite this relatively good result, the company went further with its &quot;tread lightly&quot; initiative, committing to a 25% CO2 reduction per journey by 2012 and a comprehensive 10-point environmental plan. But there are also pitfalls - many marketers are wary, and for good reason, of going out on a limb and risking accusations of hypocrisy or exploiting public fears. If the reality does not match up to the claim, a company risks being accused of &quot;greenwash&quot; and damaging its brand. Most recently, in November, the Advertising Standards Authority rapped Shell for an ad that claimed the oil company used its waste carbon dioxide to grow flowers, when less than 0.5% of Shell&apos;s waste CO2 is used for this purpose. Gail Parker Renwick, senior marketing manager at British Gas, says the key way to avoid accusations of greenwash is to back words with action. &quot;It is very easy to put out green adverts, literature or web pages, but we actually follow up on our claims.&quot; Parker Renwick cites as an example British Gas&apos;s long-term commitment to an energy-saving social experiment it has run for the past 18 months with 64 volunteer households across the UK. David Thorp, director of research and information at the Chartered Institute of Marketing, says marketing&apos;s role is changing and the value of social marketing is set to become increasingly important over the next decade. &quot;The need to inform consumers about their choices and the impact of their consumption behaviour will become increasingly important,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s not far-fetched to envisage a time when each marketing team has a social marketing specialist embedded to ensure that awareness of sustainable consumption is communicated as part of the overall marketing message, and to encourage the adoption of socially desirable behaviours.&quot; Charlotte Mullen, HR and marketing director at recruitment agency Phee Farrer Jones, says companies are interested in green marketing not only as a consumer-facing communication, but also as a way of presenting themselves to potential candidates as a desirable place to work. &quot;These things are important if you want to make the Sunday Times list of 100 best places to work. &quot;If you want to get into corporate social responsibility, you wouldn&apos;t need to come from a marketing background. In fact, you would be more likely to come with marcomms experience from PR or a charity.&quot; Most marketers agree that green awareness among consumers will grow and it seems clear that such a profound shift in public perception and attitudes must ultimately affect every aspect of a company. Since marketers sit at the nexus between a brand and consumers, they have a special role to play in the green revolution."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/21/theuscannotdeliver", "publicationDate": "2008-01-21T22:00:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "US news", "Iraq", "Iran", "Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto", "George Bush", "Israel", "Palestinian territories"], "sentences": ["From Burma and Darfur to Colombia and Taiwan - the EU has a network of increasingly complex economic and political relationships."], "title": "The US cannot deliver", "article": "George Bush&apos;s speech on democracy was beautifully crafted and full of proper reflections on the historic role of the US in promoting freedom in Asia - namely Japan. He failed to mention its complete failure in Latin America or Africa and offered nothing newer than his seven-year-old &quot;freedom agenda&quot; to the Arab world. The time has come for Europe to help a troubled globe - from Kenya to Pakistan to Palestine - to understand that democracy, human rights, the rule of law and economic freedom - the EU&apos;s founding principles - offer more lasting peace and prosperity than the simplistic Bush formula. Bush praised the Palestinians for electing President Mahmoud Abbas but ignored their equally free and fair election of Hamas last year: I have an interest as I chaired the EU&apos;s parliamentary observer mission for both elections. It is the EU that has kept Palestine&apos;s hospitals and schools open. He patted the Algerians on the back for a deeply flawed presidential election (I was there too) and enthused about the pathetic attempts by the Saudis and other autocratic regimes in the region to give their people a tiny choice. The message of freedom and democracy for the Arabs is one that I have always supported - as my kinsman TE Lawrence put it &quot;freedom, that many-pillared worthy house&quot; - but the US cannot deliver. And the main problem is Bush himself. His seven-year delay in getting to Palestine, despite his historic commitment to a two-state solution, his support for tyrants like President Hosni Mubarak, his conviction that God is on his side against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s invocations of Allah and his ludicrous posturing over his failure in Iraq make him an ultimately silly figure. Terrorism can only be confronted by conviction in universal human values. Faith is often blind. In reality the United States is treading water until the inauguration of the new president next January and a Democrat-controlled Congress makes few waves abroad due to deep US unpopularity across the globe. So 2008 presents a unique opportunity for the EU to export democracy and human rights - and it has the resources. In 2002 the UN published a profound examination of Arab human development - written by Arab experts - and demonstrated that the region was the hungriest in the world for democracy. Since then, the activities of the US in the region have made it difficult for other pro-democracy actors to get involved. But in parliaments around Europe the demand for involvement is regularly expressed. In the first Foreign Office question time since the new year on Tuesday January 8, MPs from all sides probed David Miliband over the Middle East, Iran, China and Russia. Many asked what role the EU is playing. From Burma and Darfur to Colombia and Taiwan - the EU has a network of increasingly complex economic and political relationships. Brussels&apos; greatest chance to influence reform is in China, and because of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. Not for nothing does Mia Farrow call them the &quot;genocide Olympics&quot; after China&apos;s role in Sudan - and there is mounting evidence of genocide against religious minorities in China itself. On December 27, leading Chinese activist Hu Jia was taken away by 20 policemen; his crime was publicising Beijing&apos;s appalling pollution and the clearing of hundreds of thousands of homes (without compensation) to make way for the Olympics. His friend, Christian human rights attorney Gao Zhisheng - sometimes called China&apos;s Lech Walesa - disappeared in September after writing an open letter attacking Olympic corruption. I had regularly been in touch with both. However, also on December 27, President Hu Jintao addressed a seminar on religious freedom, responding to a European clamour. The assumption that democracy is inevitable is undermined by Belarus, Cuba, North Korea, Venezuela, Zimbabwe and many other territories. Indeed, there is increasing evidence of a concerted reaction against reform, organised by China and Russia. For some months thinktanks have been pointing to the &quot;democracy backlash&quot; against the colour revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine and Lebanon. This takes the form of systematic repression of dissidents, control over telecoms and the internet and usually repression or control of the media. The Americans - no slouches at selling the technology in the first place - say it is being re-sold to Belarus, Venezuela or Zimbabwe. However feeble the EU&apos;s foreign policy, operating as always at the lowest common denominator, at least it has some moral basis to sell democracy. Surely it is now up to the EU to take over the mantle from the US of democracy promotion beyond its borders. The European Union&apos;s democracy and human rights instrument, which I established in 1992 with the aim of reforming the Soviet bloc, should be redirected towards &quot;difficult&quot; countries such as China, Russia and Iran during 2008. With a budget of some \u00a3100m a year, the EU has now opened a call for tenders. The problem is that these bids are published. This makes it impossible for the sort of programmes that have a real effect, such as those &quot;below-the-radar&quot; activities deployed in Serbia by Brussels during the 90s. Many EU politicians and democracy promotion experts believe that, apart from the mainstream support to large NGOs or broadcasters, the EU should also have a more flexible, expert and deniable mechanism; a European Endowment for Democracy - modelled on Washington&apos;s National Endowment for Democracy. In Belarus, literally on the EU&apos;s border, the US body is running some 60 pro-reform programmes, the EU is running none. It is time to take democracy seriously again as a platform for reform. As Benazir Bhutto understandably said, democracy is the best revenge against extremism."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/23/china", "publicationDate": "2008-01-23T12:04:31Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Pornography", "Culture", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The live site, whose server was based in Taiwan, charged viewers to watch strip shows or other pornographic performances that were staged in China.", "China has attempted to stifle online criticism of the ruling Communist Party and discussion related to sensitive topics such as Tibet and Taiwan by ordering websites to register with authorities."], "title": "Chinese government shut down thousands of porn websites", "article": "China shut down 44,000 websites and arrested 868 people for &quot;unhealthy&quot; internet pornography last year, according to state media.

Nearly 2000 people involved in internet pornography activities were also penalised, the official Xinhua News Agency said. China&apos;s online population has soared to 210 million people and could surpass the United States this year to become the world&apos;s biggest, the official China Internet Network Information Center said earlier this month. The Chinese president, Hu Jintao, said the country&apos;s sprawling internet posed a threat to social stability. One of the sites shut down was selling real-time porn - 33 people were arrested, according to state media. The live site, whose server was based in Taiwan, charged viewers to watch strip shows or other pornographic performances that were staged in China. &quot;This operation started up in the second half of 2006 and took in more than one million yuan [\u00a371,000] in just three months,&quot; Xinhua said. The site was said to have been the most widely visited pornographic site among those that were shut down as part of last year&apos;s clean up. Human rights groups have said the government&apos;s internet campaign has been used as a thinly veiled pretext to crack down on dissent and round up online dissidents ahead of the Olympics. China has attempted to stifle online criticism of the ruling Communist Party and discussion related to sensitive topics such as Tibet and Taiwan by ordering websites to register with authorities. Authorities registered 199,000 websites last year, Xinhua said, but refused 14,000 for failing to get official registration or to apply for official approval. China recently said it wanted to exert more control over internet videos and video-sharing websites. The government employs tens of thousands of internet censors and a vast network of electronic filters to control online information. Chinese websites also often hire their own censors to eliminate certain content. The anti-pornography campaign would continue until September, Xinhua said, &quot;after the Beijing Olympic Games end&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/23/comment.marcelberlins", "publicationDate": "2008-01-23T15:16:43Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["Today, 192 countries are members, but there are still only 15 on the security council, and the same five still have the veto (even if in 1971, Taiwan surrendered the China seat to the mainland)."], "title": "Marcel Berlins on the UN security council", "article": "When it was decided in 1945 that the new United Nations should have a security council of 15 members (five of them permanent and with a veto), the UN&apos;s global membership numbered 51. Today, 192 countries are members, but there are still only 15 on the security council, and the same five still have the veto (even if in 1971, Taiwan surrendered the China seat to the mainland). It is understandable and logical that the new geo-political configurations, more than 60 years later, call for a reassessment of the UN voting structure. The danger is that interfering with the ancient formula will produce greater problems than exist at present. It&apos;s not a question of &quot;if it ain&apos;t broke don&apos;t fix it&quot;; it is already partly broke, but unless great care is taken, the fixing could make it even more so. Gordon Brown pleased his Indian hosts this week by supporting their desire to have India occupy a permanent seat on the security council. That&apos;s all very well, but quite how this is to be achieved was not spelled out. Nor did he specify, if India was to be given our government&apos;s support, what other countries were to receive a similar blessing, and under what conditions. The other names usually bandied about, by Brown and some (but not all) proponents of enlargement, are Germany, Brazil and Japan. But what is the test for inclusion, other than vague mutterings about being &quot;an emergent global power&quot;, a substantial country considered to be punching above its weight, politically and financially? The original permanent members were the most influential nations in the world at the time, four of them having just won a war. They were not chosen because they represented a continent or region. But the criteria under which the new applicants demand to join are different, an unspecified combination of population, financial strength and political clout. In addition, regionality has crept in. It is said, for instance, that India and Japan deserve their place to mark Asia&apos;s growing global influence; Brazil represents the awakening of Latin America. There&apos;s also an argument that the growing influence of Muslim countries should be recognised. However many new permanent places are created (five is the current favourite), there will be disputes and hard bargaining about their allocations. All five of the present permanent members would have to agree. When it comes to extending the veto to the new permanents, I believe the issue should, strangely, be easier to resolve. The solution is simple. Don&apos;t give it to any of them. It is difficult enough with five. I foresee only disaster if there were to be 10 countries, with greatly differing self-interests, agendas, beliefs and political philosophies, each of them able to defy the other nine, and the broad wish of the international community, to prevent some important decision from being carried out. Imagine if that one country was, say, Brazil or India. There is no logic in having a two-tier structure of permanent members, some with a veto, some without; no logic, perhaps, but an overwhelming practical necessity. I have left until last the veto that dares not speak its name, the one to which the only possible response is: &quot;We shall never surrender&quot;. Not, anyway, until we do. The European Union has its eye on taking over the power to veto at the security council. But that can happen only if Britain and France relinquish their vetos, which looks unlikely to happen. Except that it may. \u00b7 Last week, Le Monde carried a full-page advertisement in the form of a letter to the French president urging him to reverse a decision permitting the use of Cruiser, a pesticide. If it continued to be used, the bees of France were at risk, the missive warned. &quot;Stop the massacre!&quot; This was no eccentric plea by a loony organisation, but part of a serious campaign drawing attention to a sinister and worrying phenomenon hitting not just France but (as I learned later) much of Europe and even the United States. Put simply, there has been a startling decline in the bee population - caused by factors including genetic modification of crops, pesticides and climate change - with consequences for (among other things) pollination, the condition of flowers and the availability of honey. The letter included a powerful quote from Albert Einstein: &quot;If bees disappeared from the earth, mankind would only have four years to live.&quot; Curious about this quotation, I delved further. It appears - sometimes with minor variations - in a large number of save-the-bee campaigning documents, speeches and articles, in various languages. The French organisation &quot;Terre d&apos;abeilles&quot; (World of Bees) uses it in the masthead on its website. That&apos;s a daft thing to say, I thought, it just can&apos;t be right. But why would Einstein spout such nonsense? A joke? I wondered in what circumstance he&apos;d said it. Brainy as he was on relativity and suchlike, I didn&apos;t recall reading anything that suggested an interest in the genus Apis, let alone its link with the apparent imminent extermination of humans. I looked up the quotation in the usual books. Nothing. Via Google I found a chap who had searched for it deeply and in scholarly fashion, without success. Even the compiler of The New Quotable Einstein - who would know, you&apos;d think - couldn&apos;t trace a source, and concluded: &quot;probably not by Einstein.&quot; My strong suspicion is that someone, in 1994 (its first mention, nearly 40 years after Einstein&apos;s death), simply made it up. I do hope, though, that this doesn&apos;t prevent you from treating the disappearance of bees as a matter of concern. \u00b7 This week Marcel walked out of 4 Months, 3 Weeks &amp; 2 Days. &quot;I very rarely feel the need to leave a film half way, especially such a good one.

The PC market grew by 14% last year to roughly 270m units, or 760,000 a day. Hewlett-Packard cemented its position as the biggest PC manufacturer by selling about 50m machines. Taiwan&apos;s Acer continued its explosive growth, overtaking China&apos;s Lenovo for third place, while Japan&apos;s Toshiba hung on in fifth. Those are the headline numbers from the leading PC market trackers, IDC and Garner, who both released preliminary stats last week. As usual, they are not quite the same. For example, IDC reckons total PC shipments grew by 14.3% to 269m units, while Gartner reckons they grew by 13.4% to 271.2m units. But the differences are not significant.  HP boss Mark Hurd has turned out to be a star, increasing worldwide sales by 30% to 50.5m units, on IDC&apos;s numbers. In 2006, HP was level with Dell; last year, it was ahead by 10m units. This year should be more of a fight. Michael Dell has responded by moving strongly into retail, signing deals with the likes of Tesco. It seems to be working. Although IDC reckons Dell&apos;s sales were down 4% in the US last year, it credits the company with 15.2% growth in the fourth quarter, and 17.1% growth worldwide.  Meanwhile, two Asian giants are battling it out behind the two American giants. Lenovo boosted its US sales by taking over IBM&apos;s PC division, and last year, Acer did the same by taking over Gateway. IDC commented: &quot;Combined Acer/Gateway growth continued to be the fastest among the top vendors.&quot; Whether this will continue is still open to doubt, but in the long term, it probably doesn&apos;t matter. The US market is in relative decline. It&apos;s becoming more important to be strong in Asia. According to Gartner, the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) market grew by 14.7% to 92m units in 2007, while Asia Pacific grew by 18.7% to 70.7m units. By contrast, the US market grew by only 5% to 70.1m units, says IDC.  The decline of the US is shown by the number of companies that used to be in the top five but are now just someone else&apos;s PC brands. These include IBM, Compaq, Gateway, Packard Bell and eMachines. The Japanese have also failed to take over the PC world the way they swept the markets for other consumer goods. Companies such as NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Sony and Canon have not been helped by a declining PC market in Japan, where more than half the population does email and browsing on mobile phones (tinyurl.com/2h4wee). Still, last year, Gartner reckons Japan&apos;s PC market did grow, by 5.1% to 13.9m units. Apple has also bucked the trend, and while it is relatively weak outside North America, it has climbed back into the US top five. IDC reckons Apple&apos;s unit sales grew by 30.9% last year, and it increased its US market share by one percentage point to 5.7%. Apple has yet to release official figures, and may turn out to have done even better: it certainly has in the retail market. However, most PCs are not sold via retail stores, and it will still take Apple a while to reach Dell&apos;s current US market share of 29.6%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/jan/26/wherearethemissingiphones", "publicationDate": "2008-01-26T12:57:45Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Technology sector", "Business", "Mobile phones", "Technology"], "sentences": ["This has been fed by unconfirmed rumours such as one in Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes, Apple lowers iPhone shipment projection for fiscal 2Q08, says paper, based on a story in the Chinese-language Economic Daily News."], "title": "Where are the missing iPhones?", "article": "The basic story is pretty simple. Top Apple iPhone salesman Steve Jobs claimed at Macworld Expo that he&apos;d sold 4 million of the things, while AT&amp;T said it had registered 2 million iPhones. What happened to the other 2 million? Financial analysts such as Bernstein&apos;s Toni Sacconaghi and Piper Jaffray&apos;s Gene Munster were soon on the case, and Eric Savitz has provided a good summary of the story so far at Barron&apos;s: Apple: More On The Missing iPhones. The problem is that nobody knows (apart from Apple, possibly) how many iPhones have been sold in Europe, how many are sitting on store shelves, and how many have been unlocked. Clearly there are lots of iPhones in use in China and other countries that are not on AT&amp;T&apos;s network, but how many? Analysts are interested because of the &quot;Apple tax&quot;: the network operators who supply iPhones pay Apple a monthly fee beyond the price their users have already paid for the unsubsidized phone. These payments are factored into the predicted profit figures that underpin Apple&apos;s share price. As Savitz says:  Munster himself has previously estimated that Apple gets $18 a month for every iPhone user that signs up. That comes to $432 over the course of the required two-year contract. If you use Munster&apos;s figure of 838,000 phones sold but unlocked, and multiply by $432, that is $362 million in lost revenue.    The other worry for analysts is whether the wheels are coming off the iPhone bandwagon. This has been fed by unconfirmed rumours such as one in Taiwan&apos;s DigiTimes, Apple lowers iPhone shipment projection for fiscal 2Q08, says paper, based on a story in the Chinese-language Economic Daily News.

Further, competing solely on price, as the CEO says they&apos;re doing, may pump up short-term revenue but is a recipe for disaster down the road.   Taiwan companies in general have two options: Remain entrenched in the OEM/ODM market and compete on price or aim for the hi-end. Cheapening oneself by being known as a vendor of low-cost products is no way to build a brand. And that&apos;s exactly what Asustek needs to do: Build the Eee brand. By no means is the mark ubiquitous enough to be relying on a cheap brand expansion.    Another point (mine, not Gardner&apos;s) is that the Eee PC has novelty value today that it won&apos;t have tomorrow, when there will be a dozen similar machines available, many of them better than the Asus. Hundreds of companies can knock out machines that more or less follow the Intel Classmate PC design.

How could we trust the Pakistani supreme court as the arbiter of fairness of future elections when Musharraf had removed all the judges who opposed his authoritarian rule? President Musharraf lost his cool. How could Roth (an American) presume to &apos;impose&apos; his &apos;European values&apos; on the Pakistanis! Pakistan, he said, had its own idea of democracy and human rights. Indeed, what Musharraf was offering was not some Western notion of freedom, but &apos;the essence of democracy&apos;. A day before this arresting exchange, the same Kenneth Roth had annoyed another official from a non-Western country, senior Chinese diplomat, Wu Jianmin. China, Roth pointed out, was not a democracy, so could not be expected to promote civil society around the world, but it could, surely, do more to stop mass atrocities in places such as Darfur. This launched Ambassador Wu into a passionate speech about &apos;Chinese democracy&apos; and about the folly of Westerners trying to &apos;impose&apos; their idea of democracy on others. The same sentiment was voiced by a Chinese government spokeswoman, after Hu Jia, a prominent human rights activist was arrested in December for allegedly &apos;inciting subversion of state power&apos;. His crime was to chronicle human rights abuses on his website, something the government would like to nip in the bud before the Olympics. The foreign ministry spokeswoman said: &apos;Chinese people know best about China&apos;s human rights situation.&apos; Such arguments are not new and might, with frequent use, have started to wear thin. But they resonate in some circles, where colonial guilt still colours all perceptions of the developing world. More important, perhaps, they resonate among businessmen who feel the need for a moral justification for making money in non-democratic countries: &apos;They have their own way of doing things. It is their culture. Who are we to impose...?&apos; And so on. There are several things to be said about all this. First, the West has very rarely, if ever, &apos;imposed&apos; democracy on anyone. Perhaps the world would be a better place if it had. On the contrary, during the Cold War, the main US policy was to support &apos;our bastards&apos; whoever they were, as long as they were anti-communist. A certain amount of lip service, faute de mieux, was paid to democracy, after the invasion of Iraq, but few members of the Bush administration had a serious interest in imposing free institutions. On Burma, Western governments can do little more than preach about democracy and human rights. In China, they have stopped doing even that. Business interests are simply too important. Without Chinese money, the US economy would be in even worse trouble than it is already. And China, for better or worse, is buying more and more interests in the West, as Friday&apos;s purchase of a 12 per cent stake in Rio Tinto showed. Now it is true that countries have their own histories, peculiar circumstances and cultures and that too much preaching can smack of the old missionary zeal to assume that all the things we cherish at home should be universally adopted. But culture, in the sense of custom and tradition, is often nothing but an excuse for political arrangements. Democrats from countries such as China, Pakistan or Burma do not accuse the West of imposing its values. Only authoritarians do. A few decades ago, it was fashionable, especially in Singapore and Malaysia, to talk about &apos;Asian values&apos;. Obedience to authority, sacrificing self-interest to what governments defined as national interests, accepting curbs on free speech, all these things were claimed to be specifically Asian, part of ancient traditions, something all Asians had in their cultural DNA. In fact, it was a justification of authoritarian politics inherited by the likes of Prime Ministers Mahathir and Lee Kuan Yew from the British empire. Even as the Asian values were being touted, South Koreans, Taiwanese, Thais, Chinese and Filipinos were demonstrating in huge numbers against their authoritarian rulers. In South Korea, Taiwan and, more fitfully, Thailand and the Philippines, they succeeded. And what was it that the Burmese were risking their lives for recently, not to mention Kenyans, Zimbabweans, and many others, if not more of what Musharraf dismisses as European cultural impositions? What they want is not our culture, but the kind of freedoms that we take for granted. One reason why Taiwan is such a tricky problem for the Chinese government is precisely its politics. If Chinese culture demands authoritarian politics, or what Ambassador Wu would call &apos;Chinese democracy&apos;, then what about Taiwan? Are the Taiwanese any less Chinese? When it comes to human rights, and not just political rights (although the two are obviously linked), things can become more complicated. It is not always easy to define what should be regarded as a human right. Child labour, for example, can be a necessity in very poor countries. Trying to stop it, in the name of human rights, can make things worse for people instead of better. Nor is there a universal agreement on the precise age at which a person stops being a child. But again, culture is often a poor excuse for inhumanity. Slavery, female circumcision or stoning of adulterous women are undoubtedly part of certain cultures, in that they are traditional practices. So is widow burning in India. This is not a good argument, however, for continuing such practices. To what extent the West can, or should, directly intervene, is a difficult question. Lord William Bentinck, who served as governor-general of India in the 1830s, banned widow burning and infanticide in the name of universal moral law. But he did so with the full support of Hindu reformers. And, after all, the British were more or less in charge, not a situation that is likely to repeat itself. Local support is the crucial factor, when we talk about promoting reforms and cultural changes. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, signed in 1948 by China, Burma and the Soviet Union, among many other countries, would certainly be supported by most people in the world, wherever they are. It is hard to imagine Chinese, Pakistanis, North Koreans or Zimbabweans being in favour of torture, arbitrary arrest, slavery or lawlessness for cultural reasons. All human beings would like to be free to express their thoughts and beliefs, without danger of being arrested or worse. Who would not like &apos;the right to life, liberty and security of person&apos;? The problem is that these rights can only be guaranteed under certain political conditions. No party, or ruler, should be above the law. People should not be arrested for peacefully criticising their government. There must be mechanisms to resolve peacefully political conflicts of interest and to change a government in power, if most people desire it. Institutions that can accomplish these aims may take different forms, according to local cultures and conditions. But they can all be adequately described by one word, which has been much abused of late, but still has enough power left to inspire, in Beijing and Rangoon no less than in Barcelona or Washington DC: democracy."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/03/britishidentity.uk", "publicationDate": "2008-02-03T15:16:13Z", "tags": ["British identity and society", "UK news", "BBC", "Television industry", "Scotland", "Media"], "sentences": ["We might be able to insist on homegrown vegetables, but isn&apos;t it slightly absurd to hunt for Scottish tomatoes, only to find they come in a pack made in Taiwan and bearing labels printed in Poland?"], "title": "Brian Morton: Let's stop obsessing over the 'Made in Scotland' label", "article": "I used to take BBC Scotland&apos;s shilling, and, truth to tell, I&apos;ve been guilty in the past of lurking up alleys, waiting to put the boot into an ex-employer with whom I parted on less than completely positive terms. So it&apos;s better to keep the brickbats for when they&apos;re deserved. The recent controversy about how &apos;Scottish&apos; some of the programmes that bear that byline actually are isn&apos;t one of those moments. A few supportive points about the BBC always merit repeating - some general, some more particularly Scottish. The licence fee is extraordinary value for money. Or, at least it would be if the programmes were better and there were less bureaucratic wastage. You don&apos;t have to be Wilkins Micawber or John Maynard Keynes to know that the licence fee is too small. This has become one of the oddest and most diversionary of all political hot potatoes. Any discussion of an increase inevitably leads to a stand-off. On the one side, there&apos;s the BBC&apos;s wanly Churchillian &apos;give us the tools and we will finish the job&apos; or, in other words, give us the money first and we&apos;ll set about raising the quality. On the other, there&apos;s the public&apos;s understandable but illogical insistence on seeing results before they dig that tiny bit deeper to make the Corporation viable again. Then there are the &apos;obscene&apos; salaries paid to favoured presenters. Compared with the money handed over to young men for kicking a ball round a park, the amounts concerned barely crest the national minimum wage. But there are questions of personal taste: anything more than a fiver a show is too much for Jonathan Ross by my accounting. A couple of years ago, a location crew from children&apos;s series Raven racked up at my door in Argyll looking for an old ruin. I offered my services immediately, but it seemed they wanted something medieval. Now, apparently, they&apos;re filming in India and the crew is flown out to somewhere that allegedly looks more like the real thing than, um, the real thing. This always makes good copy. The waste. The insult to Scotland. The lack of logic. Weren&apos;t the real Odessa Steps good enough for Sergei Eisenstein? You didn&apos;t catch him building a replica out of MDF and quick-dry cement in Spain at Soviet expense. It&apos;s only possible to put a seriously negative spin on a story like this if you don&apos;t understand the realities or the economics of filming or if you have an axe to grind with the BBC and its disbursement of licence-payers&apos; money. Winning Ross&apos;s Film 2008 was a major coup for BBC Scotland and each show bears its byline with justifiable pride. The complaint here is that a &apos;Scottish&apos; show is made in London. Older readers, or those with the appropriate taste for unusual diction, will remember when the situation was reversed and the Jamesons were broadcasting from Scotland and occasionally dining here as well. Did that make it a Scottish programme? When I was presenting a daily arts programme on Radio Scotland, I complained long and loud that all the reviewers seemed to be coming down the line from London rather than in the studio in Edinburgh. The answer to that was the same answer that the Film 2008 people give: London is where the films are, stupid. It&apos;s a fair point, though not equally applicable to both cases. Broadcasting Film 2008 from Glasgow would present genuine difficulties; listeners to a Scottish arts programme have some reason to expect some Scottish voices reviewing new films, even if the notices come in a little later than the metropolitan ones. What&apos;s brought all this to an unsightly head is the revelation last week that Waterloo Road, ostensibly a Scottish production, is only so because its executive producer, who made the programme in Manchester, is now working for BBC Scotland. It&apos;s a storm in a teacup, but it illustrates a couple of valuable points. First, the provenances are largely meaningless. The BBC is the BBC whether north or south of the border and now so deeply implicated in the private sector through the use of independent production and outsourced effort that geographical demarcations are far less important than fiscal ones. Second, the cherished &apos;autonomy&apos; of BBC Scotland is largely an illusion. If the BBC is a last bastion of Sovietism, practising command economy in a mixed-market world, then BBC Scotland is no more &apos;independent&apos; than was Kazakhstan in 1977. BBC Scotland is run by an arm of the Soviet known as &apos;nations and regions&apos;. They don&apos;t come and park tanks in your main square, but they do call the shots. But does it actually matter? If the Soviet analogy is worth using twice, then so&apos;s the football one. Will we care when George Burley picks some bright young midfielder whose grandfather once spent a weekend in Troon? We might be able to insist on homegrown vegetables, but isn&apos;t it slightly absurd to hunt for Scottish tomatoes, only to find they come in a pack made in Taiwan and bearing labels printed in Poland? The BBC&apos;s &apos;Scottish&apos; output is in a similar position, revealing an inevitable mix of provenances. Do we really want a quota system, on the Canadian model? The counterpunch to that is that we already have one. BBC Scotland is not answerable to &apos;nations and regions&apos;, but already hocked to a Gaelic-language service that makes political but little demographic sense and no economic sense whatsoever. What matters is the quality of programme-making, not the country of origin. But, that&apos;s a whole different problem."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/feb/04/tesco.poland", "publicationDate": "2008-02-04T00:30:29Z", "tags": ["Tesco", "Poland", "Supermarkets", "Business", "World news", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Tesco made its first foray abroad in Hungary in 1995 before entering Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia the following year, then taking a more daring step into Thailand and Taiwan 10 years ago."], "title": "Tesco outposts facing Polish revolt", "article": "The bleeping of the tills stops and the Tesco cashiers grin conspiratorially when I ask to see Iwona Mandat, the head of the Work Confederation, Poland&apos;s newest trade union. &quot;You need to go round the back, where the security guards are,&quot; says an anonymous worker. &quot;She&apos;ll tell you everything you need to know but I can&apos;t talk to you any more.&quot; Past a series of CCTV cameras and questioning from the store manager and head of security, Mandat is sat behind a desk in a small room at the back of a vast corrugated metal shed. She is a slight, calm, 51-year-old working class mother of two, who plans a small revolution. The woman is rapidly becoming well known in Czestochowa, which is at the heart of a dispute about pay and conditions between the ambitious UK supermarket group and workers in one of its many overseas outposts. &quot;I want talks to solve everything, but if they fail, a strike will be the only option,&quot; Mandat says. &quot;We haven&apos;t had a pay rise from Tesco in nine years, and some people are calling for a strike as soon as possible.&quot; Mandat says full-time employees at her store take home about 800 zloty (\u00a3165) for a 170-hour month.

Tesco says almost all Mandat&apos;s claims are inaccurate. In response to questions about pay rates, a Tesco spokesperson said: &quot;The welfare of our employees is vitally important to us and we strongly refute these allegations. Pay increases are awarded annually and all employees at our store in Czestochowa received a pay rise in 2007 which equated to an average increase of 9%.&quot; The lowest pay rise in the store last year, says the company, was 2.4% - and that was above the rate of inflation. Since the pay award, however, inflation has taken off. It hit 4% in December, with food price inflation running at 7.9%. Tesco insists that all workers were paid more than the Polish minimum wage until last month, when there was a big increase in the national minimum wage. As a result Tesco Poland does now have staff on the minimum wage.  The facts may be disputed, but what is clear is that Tesco is facing a potentially damaging dispute in one of its key international markets. The Work Confederation has 219 members, almost half the workforce at Tesco&apos;s Czestochowa store. Mandat says the organisation is growing fast and is in contact with disgruntled Tesco employees across Poland, including the &quot;August 80&quot; trade union at Tesco&apos;s store at Tychy, which is also threatening a strike. Mandat is hoping for support from the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions (OPZZ) as well as unionised Tesco workers in Britain. &apos;Subhuman&apos;  &quot;Tesco&apos;s chief in London should know we want the company to grow and prosper, but we want Polish management to stop killing the brand by treating staff as subhumans,&quot; says Mandat, whose grandfather was a coal miner and father was sent to a German concentration camp. &quot;We want to be proud to work for Tesco, like we were at the beginning. For that, we want to be treated with respect and we need a pay rise.&quot; Seven employees, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed they are &quot;very unhappy&quot; with their salaries and conditions. The Work Confederation&apos;s proposed pay rise, they say, would change their lives. The workers say they could earn more at a factory making airbags for cars, but want to stay at Tesco because of the friendships they have formed. Many have worked at the Czestochowa store since it opened in 1999. The Work Confederation says that after several failed attempts, it has set a February 21 deadline for pay discussions. Tesco told the Guardian it had already met the Work Confederation several times and would meet again this month. The company added that the Work Confederation was not the only union it was talking to. Tesco&apos;s Polish subsidiary, Tesco Polska, is the largest retailer in Poland and Britain&apos;s largest investor in the country. Tesco Polska faces competition from rival chains such as Carrefour and Albert, but after buying Polish stores from German retailer Hit and Austrian retailer Julius Meinl, it has dominated the market. Number one  For the financial year ending 2007, Tesco Polska reported 17% revenue growth to \u00a31.35bn. Ryszard Tomaszewski, Tesco Polska&apos;s chief executive, said: &quot;Our ambition is clear: we want to be number one.&quot; The company is so prominent in Poland that during his October election campaign, the prime minister, Donald Tusk, held a press conference at a Tesco store in Hammersmith, London. Poles who lived under communism remember shelves devoid of all but the least popular items. When Tesco first came to Czestochowa, the locals were delighted.  But there are recurring fears that Poland&apos;s unchecked hypermarket boom has caused social and economic problems. Former finance minster Teresa Lubinska said: &quot;Hypermarkets like Tesco are no investment. They are not vital for economic growth.&quot; Mandat disagrees, she doesn&apos;t want Tesco to leave Poland - she says it just needs to reform. Shopping around Tesco&apos;s overseas interests have a relatively low profile in Britain but progress during the past 13 years has been significant. The company operates in 12 markets outside the UK, as far afield as the US and China. Britain&apos;s largest retailer boasts that more than half its floor space is located abroad, with 100,000 employees serving more than 15 million customers and generating \u00a311bn in sales and \u00a3560m of profit. &quot;The full emergence of international retailing is not something that will happen overnight - it requires a long-term approach,&quot; Tesco says on its website, adding that it wants to focus on building a &quot;leading local brand&quot; in a few countries rather than just plant flags for the sake of it. Tesco made its first foray abroad in Hungary in 1995 before entering Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia the following year, then taking a more daring step into Thailand and Taiwan 10 years ago. The company has tended to make its moves with little fanfare, preferring to build solid businesses before shouting about success. Its latest international expansion has been into the US, formally announced in February 2006 but coming to fruition only after a series of trials, with a west coast opening last year. Tesco has prided itself on a flexible approach rather than trying to export its British model. In Thailand it has used a store layout and format that borrows from traditional &quot;wet markets&quot; where customers rummage through piles of produce to pick what they want.Terry Macalister"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/feb/05/chinafreeshongkongjournali", "publicationDate": "2008-02-05T09:48:00Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "China", "Human rights", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["He was convicted of buying information and passing it to Taiwan - charges rejected by his family and his employer, Singapore&apos;s Straits Times."], "title": "China frees Hong Kong journalist", "article": "Hong Kong journalist Ching Cheong, who was jailed in mainland China on spying charges, has been released after serving less than half a five-year sentence.

But this week Alan Johnson announced a new push for putting it in our drinking water, with some very grand promises - and in the face of serious opposition.  General Jack D Ripper developed his theories about environmental poisoning and bodily fluids when he experienced a pervasive sense of emptiness during the physical act of love. He instantly identified the cause, as documented in Dr Strangelove: &quot;Do you realise that in addition to fluoridating water, there are studies under way to fluoridate salt, flour, fruit juices, soup, sugar, milk, ice cream? Ice cream, Mandrake? Children&apos;s ice cream! You know when fluoridation began? 1946, Mandrake. How does that coincide with your post-war Commie conspiracy, huh?  &quot;It&apos;s obvious, isn&apos;t it? A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual, and certainly without any choice. That&apos;s the way your hard-core Commie works.&quot; Bill Etherington MP calls fluoride &quot;poison&quot;. Nazis supposedly used it to subdue people in concentration camps. According to a former Guardian alternative health columnist, fluoride is &quot;in the same league as lead and arsenic&quot;. The reality is that anyone making any confident statement on fluoride speaks way beyond the evidence. In 1999 the Department of Health commissioned the centre for reviews and dissemination at York University to do a systematic review of fluoridation and its effects on dental health. Little new work has been done since. In the review, 3,200 research papers, mostly of very poor quality, were unearthed. The ones that met the minimum quality threshold suggested there was vaguely, possibly, around a 15% increase in the number of children without dental caries in areas with fluoridated water, but the studies generally couldn&apos;t exclude other explanations for the variance. Of course, the big idea with fluoride in water is that it can reduce social inequalities in dental health since everyone drinks it. But there isn&apos;t much evidence on that either.  So when the British Dental Association says there is &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; that adding fluoride to water helps fight tooth decay, it is in danger of stepping into line with Ripper. And when Johnson says fluoridation is an effective, relatively easy way to help address health inequalities, he is really just pushing an old-fashioned line which says complex social problems can be addressed with \u00a350m worth of atoms.  But since I&apos;m in the mood for scaremongering, let&apos;s not forget the potential harm. A study from Taiwan found a high incidence of bladder cancer in women from areas where the natural fluoride content in water was high. It might have been a chance finding; but it could be real.  The problem is one of small effect sizes. Fluoride and bladder cancer would be a pig to research as the effect size is small, the exposure runs over half a century, and the outcome - bladder cancer - takes a lifetime to reveal itself. Welcome to the finer details behind &quot;more research is needed&quot;. And the numbers can get very scary, very quickly: in the UK a 10% increase in risk would give you 1,000 extra new cases of bladder cancer a year. Fear. Actually, I enjoyed that. Maybe I should move to the Mail."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/09/internet.china", "publicationDate": "2008-02-09T11:59:56Z", "tags": ["Internet", "China", "Human rights", "Blogging", "Search engines", "Digital media", "Technology", "World news", "Media", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The scene this week at a suburban wangba in Beijing was typical: scores of young people hunched in front of screens in a dimly lit room; the men in hoodies and parkas jabbing at their keyboards, blasting aliens and soldiers, while the women are transfixed by weepy Korean soaps and Taiwanese gameshows.", "The authorities keep a permanent block on some sites, such as BBC news, Amnesty or non-government sources of information on Tibet, Taiwan, the Tiananmen Square massacre and Falun Gong."], "title": "Behind the Great Firewall", "article": "     There were two very different snowstorms that blanketed China in the run-up to this week&apos;s Spring Festival. The first, reported by the state media, was a natural disaster heroically battled by half a million troops and Communist Youth League volunteers. It left 5.8 million people stranded, but the people ultimately prevailed. The second, reflected through the prism of internet cynics, was a calamity exacerbated by official incompetence, indolence and optimistic weather forecasts. While the old media have quoted &quot;heartwarming words&quot; of appreciation for the government&apos;s response and praised its own &quot;heroic&quot; reporters, the internet has been abuzz with furious denunciations of state broadcasters, forecasters and officials for getting the picture wrong. Such competing public opinions - unheard of 10 years ago - are becoming familiar in China these days as the world&apos;s biggest censor struggles to cope with the explosive growth of the internet. With 200,000 new netizens every day, China&apos;s online population is on the brink of overtaking the United States as the biggest in the world. That landmark could come today, next week, or next month. According to the China Internet Network Information Centre, there were 210 million internet users at the end of last year, just 5 million behind the US. But China is adding 6 million new users a month - more than 10 times the pace of US growth. In an Olympic year, and at a time of surging economic growth, the new figures are taken by some as proof of Beijing&apos;s irresistible rise. Not everyone likes it. Free speech activists fear it will increase the influence of China&apos;s censors in the virtual world. Foreign governments have raised concerns that the country has become a breeding ground for pirates, hackers and cyber spies. It was not supposed to be like this. After the internet was connected to China in 1987, civil rights campaigners hoped it would be a catalyst for political reform. But 21 years on, the Communist party is still in power and its model of a tightly controlled internet is gaining ground, if only by force of numbers. The world&apos;s most popular blog? Lao Xu, written by the actor and director Xu Jinglei, which boasts 137 million visitors. The biggest distributor of online video? Tudou, which claims to have overtaken YouTube with over 1bn megabytes of data transfers every day. Then there is Baidu, which has trounced Google in the Mandarin search engine market, and Alibaba, whose boss Jack Ma is a national hero for humbling eBay and taking over Yahoo&apos;s operations in China. Language, culture and the Great Firewall of China - the state&apos;s information shield - protect the government and big business players from competition. Instant messaging and social networking are dominated here by Tuscent&apos;s QQ service. The game world is ruled by Shanda Entertainment and Giant Interactive rather than Nintendo and Sony. Sina and Sohu have a lockhold on the news. In every sector in China, domestic players are on top. Some are now starting to look overseas. Baidu recently launched a Japanese service. Experts say that by overtaking the US as the world&apos;s biggest user base, China will attract investment, commercial traffic and technology. With this will come influence. &quot;This is a big landmark. The US has almost reached the point where it has not much room to grow. China is the opposite. In terms of new connectivity and economic growth, China is definitely the place,&quot; says Xiao Qiang, the founder of the California-based China Digital Times.  Beijing is thought to have the planet&apos;s most sophisticated blocking equipment, which is used to guard virtual walls against external threats. Internally, it relies on a system of official monitoring and corporate self-censorship. Most of the routers and other parts come from US companies, such as Cisco. Campaigners suspect China is passing its censorship know-how to Cuba, Vietnam and several African countries. &quot;China is exporting a model where the internet is a tool for economical development, social networking, marketing business and propaganda, but not for free expression. China is very proud of this. They spent dozens of millions of euros to build firewalls, cyber-police and cyber-censors,&quot; says Vincent Brossel of Reporters Without Borders. Passionate He says China is lobbying at an international level for more state control of the net, which is currently managed by a US-based independent organisation. &quot;If this happens, it will be the end of the freedom of expression on the web.&quot; But the internet is also changing China and taking on characteristics not seen elsewhere. Compared with their counterparts in the US, surveys suggest Chinese netizens are more passionate about the web, three times more likely to feel freer in the virtual world than in reality, and more than twice as likely to consider themselves addicted. With an average ago of 35 - seven years younger than in the US - they are primarily interested in entertainment, and believe the net is more satisfying in this respect than TV, movies or meeting friends. Pornography, a key driver of the internet elsewhere, is less of a factor in China, where the government routinely announces sweeps of online &quot;spiritual pollution&quot;. Last month, state media announced the closure of 44,000 websites and arrests of 868 people accused of providing &quot;unhealthy&quot; content.  The web in China may be far from puritanical but while &quot;sex&quot; is the most popular search term in many countries, Google reports that in China the most sought-after themes are related to money and technology. &quot;Stock&quot; is in the top six, along with the names of three leading banks. The means of access are different too. The fastest growth last year was in rural areas. A third of users go online at net cafes, known as wangba (web bars). The scene this week at a suburban wangba in Beijing was typical: scores of young people hunched in front of screens in a dimly lit room; the men in hoodies and parkas jabbing at their keyboards, blasting aliens and soldiers, while the women are transfixed by weepy Korean soaps and Taiwanese gameshows. A few sleep at their consoles. One woman knits. There is an occasional grin, the odd laugh. But for the most part, the only sound is the clicking of mice and keyboards amid a motionless, expressionless multitude. However, the visitors say the wangba fills a hole in their lives. &quot;My life would be very boring without the net,&quot; admits Yang Jing, a 19-year-old art student from Anhui, tearing herself away from a glitzy movie. &quot;It&apos;s just occupied with school and this - I watch films, play games and chat to friends. If we didn&apos;t have the net, I wouldn&apos;t know what to do.&quot; The Yi You cafe opened only a year ago, the newest in a chain that boasts half a dozen branches in Beijing alone. In the evenings the 300 chairs are quickly claimed; other outlets have even more screens. &quot;The internet cafe business has developed very quickly in the last two years. They&apos;re everywhere,&quot; says the manager, Zong Cheng. Jeremy Goldkorn, founder of the media blog Danwei.org, says the surge in users is changing China. &quot;It is extremely significant that the internet growing at this rate because it makes it easier for information to get out,&quot; he says. &quot;I believe Chinese society in general is opening up. The internet is a cause of that, but it is also an effect. It won&apos;t lead to revolution, but it will play a part in the evolution of public debate.&quot; Roland Soong, whose Zonaeuropa blog is one of the most respected sources of information about mainland websites, believes people in China have higher expectations of the internet. &quot;In other countries, there are other platforms for ordinary people to express themselves. In China, the internet is the sole platform for citizens to raise their voices.&quot; Fabricated This enthusiasm sometimes manifests itself in alarming ways. Soong believes more stories are fabricated by people who want to promote themselves or their companies than in other countries. Online campaigns often turn into mob witchhunts, such as the recent targeting by BBS (bulletin board system) groups of a 13-year-old girl who was used by the authorities to justify tighter restrictions on online video content. In an interview with the state broadcaster CCTV she described it as &quot;very yellow [pornographic], very violent&quot;, which is fast becoming one of the slogans of the year. But other cases suggest the net is proving a positive social force, by making unelected local governments more accountable. The recent killing of Wei Wenhua, who used his mobile phone to film a fight between municipal officials and villagers, rapidly became nationwide news thanks to the fury of internet bloggers. The authorities had no choice but to arrest four suspects and fire a local official. A Guangdong newspaper reports the case of a judge being supended after pictures were posted online of him chatting on his mobile phone during a court hearing. Forestry officials in Shaanxi face a furious backlash after confirming new pictures of the endangered South China tiger that later appear to be faked. The proliferation of mobile phones, internet messaging services and bulletin boards has been cited as a major factor in recent middle-class street protests. The biggest last year saw a demonstration of thousands in Xiamen, Fujian province, against plans for a chemical factory. Mindful of public opinion, the authorities have backed down. At a national level, the State Council Information Office - which overseas the internet - can still exert a tight grip. The recent detention of human rights campaigner Hu Jia and the house arrest of his wife and two-month-old daughter made headlines around the world. In China, it is as if it never happened. The two main news portals, Sina and Sohu, make no mention of the case. Searches on Baidu and Google produce a list of pages, many of which are blocked. Others are censored by the search engines themselves, but only Google admits this alongside the results. The authorities keep a permanent block on some sites, such as BBC news, Amnesty or non-government sources of information on Tibet, Taiwan, the Tiananmen Square massacre and Falun Gong. Propaganda officials send weekly lists of restricted topics to web administrators, who are then expected to censor themselves.  But with the internet expanding so fast, there is a limit to the number of blocking orders the government can send out or how widely it can impose its authority on small websites, such as blogs and bulletin boards. For that, it must rely on self-censorship, which is far from guaranteed. Hong Bo, who blogs under the name Keso, says the opportunity to speak out online is cherished by a growing band of bloggers and BBS users. &quot;The Chinese internet has a distinctive character. Its one of the most strictly controlled in the world, but netizens&apos; behaviour still confounds the government&apos;s expectations. They ban websites and delete posts, but they haven&apos;t got everything under control.&quot;  Isaac Mao, a pioneer blogger and researcher, says the number of users is less important than the quality of their online experience, where he says there is a big gap with the United States. His organisation encourages netizens to connect their real and their virtual lives through blogs and discussions of social issues, including censorship. &quot;Rulers believe they can build a better system and get others to follow. But even though they want to change the internet, it is part of a globalised world and nobody can afford to build an isolated system. &quot;I believe the internet will change China more than China changes the internet.&quot; Popular searches: love or banking  Most popular search words in world 1 iphone 2 badoo 3 facebook 4 dailymotion 5 webkinz Most popular search words in China 1 qq (an instant messaging service) 2 China Merchants Bank 3 Industry and Commercial Bank of China 4 stock 5 xiaoyouxi (game site) Most popular &quot;what is&quot; questions in the world 1 what is love 2 what is autism 3 what is rss 4 what is lupus 5 what is sap Most popular &quot;what&quot; questions in China 1 what are blue chips 2 what are stock index futures 3 what is cpi (consumer price index) 4 what is qfii (qualified foreign institutional investors) 5 what is gdii (qualified domestic institutional investors) \u00b7 2007 Google report"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/10/yahoo", "publicationDate": "2008-02-10T10:43:08Z", "tags": ["Yahoo takeover", "Media", "Yahoo", "Technology", "Business"], "sentences": ["&apos;Microsoft&apos;s interest highlights the tremendous strength of the Yahoo brand and assets; our half-billion users, our leading products and services, our open advertising network, our technology.&apos; Yang was born in Taiwan in 1968, but tragedy hit two years later when his father died."], "title": "Yahoo's Yang needs to know where it all went wrong", "article": "To some, Jerry Yang is an icon of the net generation: boss and co-founder of world-famous internet site Yahoo, he oozes charm and informality. He rarely wears a tie, preferring open-necked shirts and slacks, plays golf not particularly well, and drinks Coke straight from the can. Unlike Dave Filo, Yahoo&apos;s other co-founder, Yang has always been the public face of the company, batting questions from the media, opening hospitals, chairing debates, speaking at numerous conferences, often to rapturous applause. But for others, Yang is the anti-hero who will never live down the criticism levelled against him by a Congressional committee last year, when he was called a &apos;moral pygmy&apos; for authorising the supply of confidential information about one of Yahoo&apos;s users to the Chinese government. The upshot was the imprisonment of two dissident journalists: both face 10-year jail terms. A former colleague of Yang&apos;s says: &apos;It was a low point for Jerry and it made him depressed. But he isn&apos;t someone prone to prolonged, painful introspection. Jerry always bounces back.&apos; And bounce back he must. As head of one of the most famous web portals in the world, but one that is out of favour on Wall Street, where the stock price has languished, Yang is staring down the barrel of a $44bn (\u00a322.6bn) hostile bid from Bill Gates&apos; Microsoft. What Yang must decide is whether this is the moment to sell. Looked at selfishly, a sale would benefit him personally to the tune of $2.2bn as he retains a 5 per cent stake in the company. So too does Filo.  But Yang, aged 40, is treading on thin ice. By his own submission, he reckons the company is undervalued. If he accepts a bid now, history could judge him harshly, viewing him as the man who sold out at the wrong moment, when the shares were on the floor. But can he take the risk? Many of Yahoo&apos;s stockholders say no. They are happy to take the money and run. Wall Street is not renowned for its patience. The funny thing is that Yahoo has been courted by Microsoft for two years. But when Yang took a phone call 10 days ago from Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer, it caught him by surprise. An unsolicited bid was like a bolt from the blue and not at all what Yang expected from an erstwhile ally to fight the common foe, the seemingly unstoppable Google.  Shell-shocked for two days, Yang gathered his wits and shot off a memo to the firm&apos;s anxious staff, which was received badly. &apos;There has obviously been a lot of talk about Yahoo, but we won&apos;t let it distract us from pursuing our transformational strategy.&apos; Really? If ever there was a case of ignoring the elephant in the room, this was it. Further into the memo, Yang changes tack, encouraging his audience to look at the upside. &apos;Microsoft&apos;s interest highlights the tremendous strength of the Yahoo brand and assets; our half-billion users, our leading products and services, our open advertising network, our technology.&apos; Yang was born in Taiwan in 1968, but tragedy hit two years later when his father died. At the age of 10, knowing no English except the word for shoe, he emigrated with his mother to California and she scraped together enough money to send her incredibly bright 18-year-old to Stanford University, where he gained a degree in electrical engineering. While studying for a doctorate he met fellow graduate Filo and the two, rather than studying for their theses, spent time indexing their favourite internet links and posting them on a website. Soon, people other than their friends were using the site and by 1994 it had logged a million hits. Yang and Filo frequently point out that technology, not money, was the motivator, but either way, they knew they were onto something big. Six months from completing his thesis, Yang took a leave of absence from Stanford from which he is yet to return, and 12 months later, with venture capital support, he and Filo launched Yahoo. The name was Yang&apos;s idea, reflecting his anti-establishment sense of humour at the time, with the letters standing for Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle.  Ranked 217 in the Forbes rich list, Yang already has more than $2bn in the bank, but has started giving some of his wealth away. He and his wife, Akiko Yamazaki, pledged $75m to Stanford for the construction of an environmental studies building and a training centre for doctors. But what has happened to Yahoo in the past five or six years? It was all so different at the time of the high-tech boom, when Yahoo was viewed as the internet company of choice by web users around the world. Back in 2000, Yang told the Guardian, The Observer&apos;s sister paper: &apos;We say we don&apos;t like to be at the bleeding edge, because we don&apos;t like to bleed. But we like to be at the leading edge, introducing services, using technologies that can be exposed to millions of our users, rather than a smaller subset. &apos;The internet is a very rough environment, so unless something is pretty battle-tested, we tend not to put it out there.&apos;  Those words will ring hollow to Yahoo&apos;s critics today. The company is perennially carpeted for trying to do too many things at once; critics liken it to peanut butter, spread too thin, and in too many places, satisfying no one in particular. And all the time Google has been hacking away at the highly lucrative search engine advertising market, taking its share to nearly 60 per cent with Yahoo counting for 19 per cent and Microsoft 11 per cent. The enormous growth of social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace seems to have caught Yahoo off guard. Yang, who has long been in charge of corporate strategy, attempted to set up Yahoo&apos;s own social networking and music subscription service, but both have recently been closed down. Yang, always on the Yahoo board, only took over as chief executive in June, after Terry Semel stepped down. Ten days ago, he confirmed that the group&apos;s profits were down and that he was laying off 1,000 employees. Inside Yahoo&apos;s headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, morale is said to be at rock bottom. But Microsoft is at the gate, and observers are doubtful that Yahoo has an independent future. Whether Yahoo goes to Microsoft, or allies itself with Google (here, Yang would run into anti-trust issues), or breaks itself up and sells bits to the highest bidder, the company will probably be consigned to history. Scott Rosenberg, a technology expert and head of Miro Consulting in New York, doesn&apos;t envisage a happy outcome. He says: &apos;These big takeovers - AOL/Time Warner was the biggest - are always about failure in the present and fear of the future. And they nearly always end badly. &apos;If Microsoft wins Yahoo, you will see most of Yahoo&apos;s smart people depart, and its customers gradually parcelled out to attempt to bolster Microsoft&apos;s ever-faltering efforts to build an online business.&apos; Rosenberg dismisses the danger to Google of a tie-up between Yahoo and Gates, saying: &apos;Google needs to worry about the drag on its stock from the broader market troubles, and the drain on its brainpower by the lure of new start-ups. Microhoo is hardly a threat.&apos; As for Yang, assuming a deal is done, he&apos;ll be able to play a little more golf, make more of those after-dinner speeches and, perhaps, return to the half-finished thesis that he left to gather dust all those years ago."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/12/bangladesh.burma", "publicationDate": "2008-02-12T00:09:39Z", "tags": ["Bangladesh", "China", "World news", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Asia Pacific", "South and Central Asia", "Myanmar"], "sentences": ["The march of democracy in the past 30 years makes an impressive list: Europeans liberated in Portugal, Spain and Greece; all of Latin America (save Cuba) now democratic; the collapse of the Soviet empire and authoritarian regimes in Asia, from Indonesia and the Philippines to South Korea and Taiwan, while Mandela&apos;s election seemed to mark new hope in Africa."], "title": "Polly Toynbee: Try telling Bangladeshis that elections are bad for the poor", "article": "It was a moving sight: hundreds of people on rows of long benches under canopies, enthusiastically waiting to register to vote.

Look what elections did to Kenya - democracy is dangerous. Many query whether imposing late western systems on dirt-poor developing nations is a good idea.  David Miliband, the foreign secretary, was visiting Bangladesh and urging a safe return to democracy. &quot;Clean and effective government,&quot; he called for here - as he had in Afghanistan two days earlier - and in Pakistan, whose imminent elections threaten yet more bloodshed.  Voting alone doesn&apos;t guarantee democracy. Political violence, feudal patronage and corruption may break out the day after hotly contested elections. Leaders of both main Bangladeshi parties - &quot;the two ladies&quot; - are locked up on widely believed corruption charges. Frankly, it needs the pen of an Evelyn Waugh to do justice to the personal grudge war between these two 67-year-olds, one a daughter and the other a widow of founding heroes of the war of independence, who refuse to speak or compromise despite barely a sari&apos;s thickness of policy difference between them.  Today, back in Oxford, Miliband gives a lecture with a strong message on democracy in honour of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma&apos;s imprisoned leader. He reaffirms the need to back democrats wherever they are in a post-Iraq and China-influenced world growing dangerously blase about democratic values. Despite all the turmoil he has observed, he declares that a universal democratic &quot;civilian surge&quot; means &quot;there are no regional or continental values that are inhospitable to democracy&quot;.  The march of democracy in the past 30 years makes an impressive list: Europeans liberated in Portugal, Spain and Greece; all of Latin America (save Cuba) now democratic; the collapse of the Soviet empire and authoritarian regimes in Asia, from Indonesia and the Philippines to South Korea and Taiwan, while Mandela&apos;s election seemed to mark new hope in Africa. Now 60% of the world&apos;s people elect their leaders. Put like that, democracy looks unstoppable - only a matter of time before the Middle East, the Gulf states and China succumb.  Yet democracy has many enemies. China&apos;s and Singapore&apos;s leaders claim rapid economic progress needs nothing of the kind, pointing to less successful poor countries struggling with elections. Meanwhile the left is increasingly suspicious of the word &quot;freedom&quot;, hijacked by neocons. Democracy at the point of a gun can look like a fig-leaf excuse for enforcing neocolonial western interests. If democracy is such a good thing, why does the west prop up and arm autocracies such as Saudi Arabia? Why kowtow so abjectly to Chinese wealth? It was Ken Livingstone who in 1987 - back in his red-hot days - wrote a book called If Voting Changed Anything, They&apos;d Abolish It. (He&apos;s rightly rather keen on Londoners getting out to vote now). On the right there is always a business phalanx that finds stable despotism good to do business with - no problem trading with China or the Gulf. Democracy struggles to take root in countries so poor that the rice needed to keep a family alive is willingly traded for a vote: patronage and clans promising corrupt favours will trump political ideals every time. Political scientists observe that democratic governments rarely survive in countries with per capita incomes of less than $1,500 a year: Kenyans and Pakistanis live on under $1,000. The same research finds democracy rarely fails once per capita incomes rise to $6,000 a year.  But no rules about human life are absolute: in Bangladesh political passions run high, though pockets may be empty; and people impressed on Miliband time and again the importance of elections. Look at India, whose per capita income is still under $1,000, yet its democracy thrives with a free press and independent judiciary. Meanwhile Russia backslides on $8,000 a head. There is another endemic problem with democracy - the chasm between rhetoric and reality, between promise and performance. Nothing again is ever as exhilarating as the moment the Berlin Wall fell or Mandela walked free. Afterwards disillusion with the drudgery of everyday governance turns things sour. The longer established a democracy, the more secure and better run it is, then the more cynical citizens become - less likely to vote, more heartily despising their relatively uncorrupt and efficient politicians. But telling jaded Europeans to value their vote is no more use than telling well-fed western children to eat crusts that would be the envy of starving Zimbabweans.  Democracy does need constant renewal. In Britain neither of the main parties - not David Miliband in this speech - are yet willing to reform the profound dysfunctions of a system that lets the next election revolve around the super-votes of just 8,000 swing citizens in key marginals. Though in a previous job Miliband was forward-thinking in reviving the power and pride of Britain&apos;s great cities, electoral reform is still out of bounds for Labour. China&apos;s People&apos;s Daily was quick to gloat over the Kenyan fallout: &quot;Western-style democracy simply isn&apos;t suited to African conditions, but rather carries the roots of disaster.&quot; Miliband&apos;s Oxford lecture will be a resounding refutation of this, and a restatement of universal values. But he avoids Blairite hubris and triumphalism. Although he is &quot;unapologetic about a mission to help democracy spread&quot;, he also stresses the &quot;need to be cautious about our capacity to change the world&quot;, emphasising the power of international institutions - the international criminal court, the World Trade Organisation, the EU, the UN - to build the culture of democracy. &quot;Democracy can and will take root in all societies&quot;. In the end, this argument always falls back on Churchill: democracy is the least bad system yet devised, which is hardly a ringing endorsement with which to confront China or Saudi Arabia, the left or the right. Waiting with trepidation for what elections may unleash in Pakistan and Bangladesh, or next year in Afghanistan, can make orderly military rule look a better option than Kenyan-style slaughter. But then ask why were so many very poor, mostly illiterate, people queuing under those canopies in Kaliakor. They were driven by the universal desire to chose their own rulers, however difficult and dangerous the road to democracy.  polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/12/spacetechnology.china", "publicationDate": "2008-02-12T02:01:52Z", "tags": ["Space", "China", "US news", "World news", "Science", "US foreign policy", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The salesman, a naturalised US citizen originally from Taiwan, aged 58, was arrested in New Orleans along with another immigrant from China, Yu Xin Kang, 33.", "The transmitted data is alleged to include details of all sales of military technology and weaponry by the US to Taiwan over the next five years."], "title": "US charges two with spying for Chinese", "article": "A former Boeing engineer and an analyst with the US defence department were charged yesterday with supplying military secrets to China, in two separate spying cases that US authorities said underlined the ongoing threat of technological espionage. Investigators said the two cases, in Los Angeles and Alexandria, Virginia, were not connected. But a justice department official, General Kenneth Wainstein, said they showed China remained &quot;particularly adept, and particularly determined and methodical in their espionage efforts&quot;. Dongfan Chung, the former Boeing engineer, was charged with supplying the Chinese with secrets relating to the space shuttle and other Nasa programmes. He was arrested by FBI and Nasa counter-intelligence officers at his home in Orange, California, and indicted on 13 counts including economic espionage and acting as an unregistered foreign agent. Born in China, he became a US citizen and worked at Boeing until 2002, before returning as a contractor. He had security clearance to work on secret projects, but the FBI alleges that he gave China secrets from Boeing relating to the shuttle, the C-17 military transport aircraft and a rocket system. The indictment alleges that Chung&apos;s Chinese handlers began sending him &quot;tasking&quot; letters in 1979, when he worked for Rockwell International, a firm later taken over by Boeing. He gave China details of the B-1 bomber designed by Rockwell. The relationship is said to have deepened, and between 1985 and 2003 he made several trips to China, allegedly to hand over information and meet government officials to discuss how to transmit data. Though the charges against him were only revealed yesterday, Chung, 72, has been under investigation by the FBI for almost a year in connection with another Chinese-born engineer who was convicted last year of supplying the China with military data. At a justice department press conference yesterday, prosecutors said they had found no financial motive behind Chung&apos;s actions, pointing instead to &quot;loyalty to the motherland of the People&apos;s Republic of China and appreciation from government officials in China for their work&quot;. In the second case, Gregg Bergersen, 51, a Pentagon weapons systems analyst, was charged with selling secret information to a furniture businessman in New Orleans called Tai Kuo. The salesman, a naturalised US citizen originally from Taiwan, aged 58, was arrested in New Orleans along with another immigrant from China, Yu Xin Kang, 33. Kuo stands accused of passing on the information received from Bergersen to the Chinese, while Kang is said to have acted as conduit between Kuo and China. The transmitted data is alleged to include details of all sales of military technology and weaponry by the US to Taiwan over the next five years. It is not clear whether Bergersen knew where the information he supplied was destined. He was recorded by the FBI in conversation with Kuo saying: &quot;I&apos;d go to jail, I don&apos;t want to go to jail.&quot; Kuo replied: &quot;I&apos;d probably go to jail too.&quot; Bergersen faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail and a fine of $250,000 (\u00a3125,000). Justice department officials hinted that they may be searching for further spies within the system saying that there was an &quot;ongoing investigation&quot;. The threat of Chinese intrusion into US military and space technology has continued to worry the Bush administration on economic and security grounds. In September the director of national intelligence, John McConnell, said China and Russia were two of the countries most aggressively involved in spying, with their efforts running at levels approaching those of the cold war."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/feb/12/familyandrelationships1", "publicationDate": "2008-02-12T13:53:58Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "The Comic", "Family"], "sentences": ["a) Petronas Twin Towers in Malaysia b) The Empire State Building in New York c) Sears Tower in Chicago d) Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan"], "title": "The Comic half-term quiz: day one", "article": "1.

Drawn up by that least political of organisations, the International Olympic Committee, this permits no demonstration at any Olympic site. And yet, in the past century, to pick a few examples from the throng, the games have been staged by Hitler, the subject of mandatory boycotts by the US and Soviet governments, struck by terrorists, and seen protesters killed by soldiers. You have to love how it&apos;s the athletes getting the lectures. The Olympic Charter seems inconsistent. It is clearly acceptable for states to politicise the games; it goes without remark that corporations push their agendas (McDonald&apos;s sponsorship seems absurdly agenda-driven). But woe betide individual athletes who dare express a view, with the latest threatened competitors the members of the athlete group Team Darfur, which aims to use press conferences and podiums in Beijing to protest against China&apos;s support of Sudan. And so again to the 1968 podium protest by black US sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos. Smith and Carlos were ushered into pariahdom by the IOC president, Avery Brundage, who apparently loathed &quot;the politicisation of sport&quot;. This was the same Nazi-sympathising Avery Brundage who went to his grave claiming the Berlin games were &quot;the finest in modern history&quot;; and who, in 1952, declared a wish to banish women&apos;s track and field from the Olympics so people might be &quot;spared the unaesthetic spectacle of women trying to look and act like men&quot;. There isn&apos;t space to even start on his handling of the Munich Games. Were these not intensely political statements? Of course; just as the very act of awarding the games to Beijing was political, because, among other things, it ignored protests from human rights and free-Tibet campaigners. The Olympics are ineluctably political on all levels, and not just because of the nationalism that underpins them. Jesse Owens knew that even competing in 1936 was a political gamble. What if he&apos;d pulled up, or just lost? Imagine how that would have been appropriated. Even the much-praised Sydney Games were preceded by a row over whether the Aboriginal flag could be flown. Examples of politicisation during the Cold War are almost innumerable, from the attempt to cast the medal-chase as an extension of the arms race, to events like the US basketball team&apos;s loss to the Soviets in 1972 - the result of an extra-time controversy that can be summarised as the Two Tribes equivalent of &quot;added time: until United score&quot;. Think, too, of the Thatcher government&apos;s attempt to endorse the Moscow boycott, recently skewered by Colin Moynihan, who was coxing the British rowing eight at the time. &quot;Members of my crew,&quot; he recalled, &quot;reflected why - when diplomatic relations stayed intact, when the Bolshoi Ballet was due to perform in London, when trading continued between the UK and the Soviet Union, when you could buy a ticket on Aeroflot to holiday in Leningrad - it was the sportsmen and the sportsmen alone who were being urged ... to demonstrate the strength of the government&apos;s political opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan by boycotting the Games and giving up our dream for which we had worked throughout our youth.&quot; As for the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, they could barely have been more co-opted by George Bush as a piece of post-9/11 propaganda. There were more military and police in Salt Lake than there were in Afghanistan at the time. One IOC member observed: &quot;This is a show designed to send a message to Bin Laden.&quot; Um, what message? &quot;We&apos;re hosting this because of bribery. Also, more people are guarding a Utah aquatic centre than are in Tora Bora.&quot; I&apos;ll bet Osama cowered the whole fortnight. Even the Olympic flame&apos;s journey to Atlanta had to be re-routed after homophobic legislation was passed in South Carolina as an act of agitation, and this year it will not pass through Taiwan, with Taipei and Beijing accusing each other of playing politics. Frankly, then, given the precedent set by organisers, any attempt to silence individuals in Beijing should be challenged in the courts. Some insist the Games are merely a &quot;festival of youth&quot;; they must realise that description is fundamentally incompatible with the desire to suppress youthfully passionate athletes from giving voice to their conscience should they wish."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/15/brazil.health", "publicationDate": "2008-02-15T13:10:36Z", "tags": ["Brazil", "World news", "Paraguay", "Americas"], "sentences": ["&quot;We are making additional requests&quot; with Taiwan and Cuba, said Paraguay&apos;s public health minister, Oscar Martinez."], "title": "Brazil flies out yellow fever vaccine to Paraguay", "article": "The Brazilian government today flew 50,000 doses of yellow fever vaccine to Paraguay following the first outbreak of the disease in the country for 34 years.

Chinese oil workers have been taken hostage in Ethiopia and Nigeria, and opposition groups are now targeting Chinese firms in Sudan. Steven Spielberg&apos;s broadside against China&apos;s Sudan policy was just the latest reaction to Beijing&apos;s tangled web of African interests. China&apos;s role as oil investor and arms supplier to Chad and Sudan came into focus this month as Sudanese-backed rebels nearly toppled President Idriss D\u00e9by&apos;s shaky regime in Ndjamena. Last August, D\u00e9by broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in favour of a more promising economic deal from Beijing and some protection from Sudan&apos;s regional meddling. The Sudanese regime had wanted the rebels it armed and trained to take over in Chad and block the EU&apos;s imminent deployment of peacekeepers on Chad&apos;s border with Darfur. But D\u00e9by thwarted the plan with French military help and weapons from Libya. As European diplomats agonised over the prospect of their military mission being sidelined, Beijing stayed silent. As western states tried to help negotiate a settlement on Kenya&apos;s election battle, Beijing was silent again. Its sole official comment was an editorial in the People&apos;s Daily on 14 January, arguing that &apos;Western-style democracy simply isn&apos;t suited to African conditions, but rather it carries with it the roots of disaster. The election crisis in Kenya is just one typical example.&apos; Beijing&apos;s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jiang Yu, said he couldn&apos;t &apos;comment on the media&apos;s views&apos;, but reiterated that &apos;China always adheres to the principle of non-interference&apos;. Beijing&apos;s proclamations of &apos;non-interference&apos; have given way to claims that it is using its influence for the good. That&apos;s difficult to sustain in Sudan, where President Omer el-Bashir&apos;s regime has just sent its militias to burn down more towns in Darfur, but continues to obstruct and delay the deployment of a joint African Union and UN peacekeeping force. Even worse, there is a prospect of Sudan&apos;s peace deal breaking apart as Omer&apos;s regime blocks the demarcation of the north-south border through the country&apos;s oilfields and the promised referendum on the south&apos;s secession. Yet if China&apos;s influence on Khartoum seems to make little difference on the ground, the same can equally be said about the more overt western pressure on Sudan. Russia, which also arms the Khartoum regime, doesn&apos;t even dignify its critics with a response. European and American diplomats call their policy on Khartoum &apos;constructive engagement&apos;. This means that they maintain intelligence co-operation with Sudan despite, or perhaps because of, its role as host to Osama bin Laden in the 1990s. Rolls-Royce and many other European companies have provided vital technology for Sudan&apos;s oil industry, although this doesn&apos;t come close to China&apos;s multi-billion investment. Other Asian states, such as India and Malaysia, have big stakes in Sudanese oil, but have been better at dodging the opprobrium, as has Japan, which imports more Sudanese oil than China. Beyond the ethical finger-pointing is a collective sin of omission - western and Asian states alike have failed to equip and train the type of effective peacekeeping force that could protect civilians in Darfur.  Beijing claims credit for persuading Omer to accept the UN/AU peacekeepers. But Beijing knows it will face more pressure in the run-up to the Olympics. That&apos;s why Beijing&apos;s Special Ambassador to Africa, Liu Guijin, is reported to have told Sudan&apos;s Foreign Minister, Deng Alor, this month that &apos;the world is running out of patience with what is going on in Darfur&apos; and &apos;not to do things that will cause the international community to impose sanctions on them&apos;. That&apos;s a change of tack from his comments last year when asked about China&apos;s arms shipments to Sudan. He said: &apos;If I am selling a knife, I cannot ensure that my client will not use the knife for murder.&apos; Beijing may now tell us that it&apos;s taking much greater interest in how some of its clients wield their Chinese-made knives.

The home DVD market is worth an estimated $24bn (\u00a312.3bn) but has come under threat in recent years. Prices have declined as a result of online piracy and the boom in sales of personal video recorders which make it easy for consumers to save their favourite films and programmes from broadcast TV, doing away with the need for them to buy DVD box sets.  The next generation of DVDs promises to inject new growth. Both Blu-ray and HD DVD deliver high-definition graphics and sound, while the film industry has high hopes that the next generation of players will make it easier to protect their content. The TV manufacturers, meanwhile, believe the availability of content such as natural history programming and movies in the new high-definition standard will provide a reason for consumers to upgrade to the latest in HD television sets. But take-up of HD DVD and Blu-ray has been low as consumers have held off buying while Sony and Toshiba battle it out. Blu-ray has the upper hand in terms of units sold because its player is built into the Sony PlayStation 3 games console which has sold more than 10m units. Only about a million HD DVD players have been sold and the vast majority are in Japan. Toshiba, which initially seemed to have the upper hand after signing up DreamWorks, was dealt a severe blow last month when Warner Bros, the world&apos;s largest DVD producer, opted to use the Blu-ray format for all new releases, dumping HD-DVD. Consumer preferences Warner, which accounts for about a fifth of the lucrative US DVD market, was the last remaining big Hollywood studio producing discs in both formats. MGM, Fox, Walt Disney and Sony Pictures had already signed up to the Blu-ray format. On the device manufacturing side, Blu-ray is also supported by Hitachi, Matsushita and Sharp.  Then late last week the largest retailer in America and indeed the world, Wal-Mart, said it would dump HD DVD across its 4,000 US Wal-Mart and Sam&apos;s Club stores by the summer in response to consumer preference.  &quot;This decision will make my job so much easier,&quot; said Susan Chronister, one of Wal-Mart&apos;s movie buyers on the company&apos;s own Check Out blog. &quot;So ... if you bought the HD player like me, I&apos;d retire it to the bedroom, kids&apos; playroom, or give it to your parents to play their John Wayne standard definition movies, and make space for a BD (Blu-ray disc) player for your awesome hi-def experience.&quot; Wal-Mart&apos;s move followed a similar decision from consumer electronics retailer Best Buy and online video rental firm Netflix earlier in the week. At the weekend Toshiba admitted that while it has made no definite decision about the future of HD-DVD it is &quot;making various considerations about its business policy after Warner&apos;s decision and the announcements by Best Buy and Wal-Mart&quot;. Insiders believe Toshiba&apos;s board could make an official announcement that it is dropping the HD DVD format later this week. The move is a huge success for Sony, which has lost format wars in the past. Perhaps most famously, its Betamax format lost out in the home video battle to VHS. &quot;If true, this will be good news for the next-generation DVD industry in clearing up the confusion for consumers because of the format competition that had curbed buying,&quot; said Credit Suisse analyst Koya Tabata.  Certainly the DVD industry hopes that with just one standard for consumers, sales will take off. &quot;Everyone had been waiting to see who will win, so if Toshiba exits, then it could really take off for Sony,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Taiwan&apos;s CMC Magnetics, which makes a third of the world&apos;s DVD discs. In what many are calling a rerun of the Betamax-VHS video format wars of the 1970s and 80s, Blu-ray&apos;s dominance has come on the back of rising sales in Japan, where it accounted for 96% of total sales in the last quarter of last year, according to market researcher BCN.  In fact, Toshiba&apos;s discs are cheaper to produce but have a 15-gigabyte storage capacity compared with Blu-ray&apos;s 25 gigabytes. Attempts to boost sales with dramatic cuts in the price of HD DVD players in the US and Europe have had little impact.  Toshiba was also hampered by the fact that one of its major technology partners, Microsoft, did not produce a version of its successful Xbox 360 video games console with an HD DVD drive installed, as had originally been mooted. Instead Microsoft has been selling a plug-in HD DVD player. Deft gamble Sony, meanwhile, held back the launch of its PlayStation 3 - despite some serious criticism from the analyst community - in order to bring out a console with Blu-ray installed. In fact, the PS3 lags behind Nintendo&apos;s Wii in terms of monthly sales and the cost of the Blu-ray player means it makes a loss on every console shipped. But the fact that Blu-ray is likely to become the pre-eminent next generation DVD format, means sales should increase and components become cheaper. It turns out to have been a deft gamble on Sony&apos;s part. Toshiba&apos;s shares rose 5.7% to 829 yen (\u00a33.92) in Tokyo yesterday as investors gauged the positive impact of quickly abandoning what had turned into a potential money loser. Shares in Sony, which refused to comment, rose by 1%to 4,900 yen.  As for those consumers who have bought an HD DVD player, they may just have to accept that this time they made a bad decision. HD DVD players were selling on auction site eBay yesterday for about \u00a370 and the price is expected to plummet as it becomes obvious that Blu-ray has won out. As a guide to what an HD DVD player may one day be worth, the losers in some of the other most recent format wars are little more than hobbyist&apos;s pieces these days. An in-car eight-track player, for instance, was going for \u00a34.99 on eBay yesterday while a Betamax video recorder will set you back a mere \u00a320. Fallen formats: From Betamax to mini-disc  The success of Blu-ray will come as great relief to Kiyoshi Nishitani the head of Sony&apos;s video business, not just because he has seen off the threat of Toshiba but because of his failure in the last &quot;format war&quot; that he fought. Nishitani developed the Betamax videotape standard that lost out so spectacularly to Video Home System (VHS), developed by arch-rival JVC, despite the fact that Betamax, which appeared before it in the mid-1970s, was a better technology, not least because it was based on a standard used by TV professionals. Recorders that could use Betamax were produced by a range of manufacturers including Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba, Pioneer and NEC, but they did little marketing in North America. Fearing that Sony would end up with a de facto monopoly, JVC produced the VHS standard - which offered longer playing time than Betamax - and marketed it heavily in the US, gaining a lion&apos;s share of this new market. Using the scale it had in the US to reduce the cost of production, JVC was also able to flood the European home-recording market with cheaper devices and rein back the early-mover advantage enjoyed by Betamax. In 1988, Sony was forced to admit defeat and launch its own VHS recorders. It stopped making Betamax recorders in 2002. In the Asia Pacific region, where Betamax started out so well, it was quickly overshadowed by laser discs, because humidity plays havoc with magnetic tape. Laser discs gave way to DVDs, but Betamax is not dead - a variant of the technology is still used by television professionals. Betamax is not the only setback Sony has suffered. Its Digital Audio Tape devices, introduced in the mid-1980s, and mini-disc technology announced in the early 1990s were both supposed to replace Philips&apos;s magnetic cassette technology. Neither were taken up by the music industry with the same enthusiasm as CDs. Both have been in effect made obsolete by MP3 Richard Wray"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/21/china", "publicationDate": "2008-02-21T16:02:10Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Confusingly, Taiwan uses several different romanisation methods - including a variant of pinyin, tongyong pinyin - and zhuyin."], "title": "Pinyin: based on sound principles", "article": "     The phonetic alphabet developed by Zhou Youguang, pinyin, turns 50 this month, having helped up to a billion Chinese citizens to learn to read, write and in many cases speak the national language. The 102-year-old linguist is renowned as the &quot;father of pinyin&quot;, the system for representing standard Mandarin in the Roman alphabet. The country is celebrating the anniversary with lectures, a TV series and educational programmes. Although Zhou is marking the half-century by publishing the latest of his many books, he is otherwise modest about his achievements and a life so packed with incident that for many years he completely forgot a brief friendship with Albert Einstein. &quot;I&apos;m not the father of pinyin - I&apos;m the son of pinyin,&quot; says Zhou.&quot;It&apos;s [the result of] a long tradition from the later years of the Qing dynasty down to today. But we restudied the problem and revisited it and made it more perfect.&quot; The results are remarkable. Over the last half-century, the illiteracy rate in China has slumped from 80% to as little as 10% - the precise figure is disputed - thanks to a combination of mass education, simplified characters and pinyin. &quot;[Pinyin] is very simple but had a significant purpose. First, it denotes the sound of Chinese characters,&quot; Zhou explains. &quot;Second, it has helped [students] to learn putonghua, the national standard language. Before, I met a Cantonese and a Hokkien in foreign countries and couldn&apos;t communicate - I had to speak English to them. Without an alphabet you had to learn mouth to mouth, ear to ear. It&apos;s a bridge to speech between Chinese people.&quot; Chan Yuen Chi, associate professor at the School of Chinese, Hong Kong University, argues that pinyin succeeded because it was a better phonetic match than other transcription methods, and was &quot;extremely easy and convenient&quot; because it used a widely recognised alphabet rather than other symbols. &quot;On a level of practicality, it makes up for the fact that Chinese characters do not indicate the sounds themselves,&quot; he says. &quot;In politics, economics and every kind of cultural work, it has very important value. China is a country of many dialects, and hanyu pinyin helps the realising of a common language for the entire nation.&quot; Zhou&apos;s involvement came about by chance. He was a banker working in New York when the communists seized power in 1949 and, like many expatriates, he returned home to help rebuild his country. &quot;We all thought that China had a very good opportunity to develop; we didn&apos;t expect the later turmoil. History misled us,&quot; he says. It soon became clear that his economic expertise was not required or appreciated. But in 1955 the government asked him to put his hobby - languages - to use by overseeing reforms. It believed only an explosion in literacy could allow China to develop. Two years later, the unwanted career change saved him when Mao Zedong launched his anti-rightist campaign against intellectuals. &quot;Mao disliked greatly the economists - especially economic professors from America. By that time I had shifted to the line of language and writing. I was not considered a rightist. Very lucky,&quot; Zhou recalls. &quot;If I had remained in Shanghai teaching economics I think I certainly could have been imprisoned for 20 years. A good friend of mine was imprisoned and committed suicide; my student committed suicide.&quot; However, he was denounced as a reactionary academic during the Cultural Revolution in the late Sixties, and exiled to the countryside. Zhou, who still produces a paper a month from his modest flat in Beijing, is cheered to see that pinyin is growing ever more useful. Many people rely on pinyin-to-character conversion programmes to send text messages or type on their computers and even Chinese Braille is based on the system. But many students forget pinyin once they have reached their ultimate goal. &quot;Pinyin is not to replace Chinese characters; it is a help to Chinese characters,&quot; Zhou says. &quot;They have a very long tradition of more than 3,000 years ... people will use them for at least 500 years more. It&apos;s almost impossible to change to another writing system because it&apos;s so deeply rooted in China.&quot; Nor does he believe that Mandarin will overtake English as the major international language, despite China&apos;s growing power and his own surprise at the number of foreigners learning putonghua. &quot;Chinese characters or pinyin will never be a competitor to English. [Its dominance] is the work of over 400 years,&quot; he added. Background Chinese languages do not have an alphabet. Instead they have a character for each word, which does not indicate pronunciation (although it sometimes contains a phonetic element).  The resulting difficulty in learning to read and write - or learning putonghua, standard Mandarin, if not a native speaker - has led to numerous attempts to develop phonetic representation systems. The first attempts to transcribe Mandarin in the Roman alphabet were designed by foreigners seeking to learn Chinese; the best-known - though not the first - is Wade-Giles, produced and refined by two British diplomats in the second half of the 19th century. The Chinese subsequently produced their own phonetic alphabet, Zhuyin, also known as Bopomofo after its first letters. Then came Gwoyeu Romatzyh, a romanisation system that spelled the tones as well as the sounds of words - but proved so complicated that few could master it.  The communists turned to Zhou Youguang and his team to develop a replacement that could establish standard Mandarin as a truly national language and increase literacy. Chinese children who grow up speaking putonghua use pinyin to associate characters with spoken words. Those who grow up with other languages also use it as a guide to putonghua pronunciation.  Confusingly, Taiwan uses several different romanisation methods - including a variant of pinyin, tongyong pinyin - and zhuyin. Attempts to enforce a single system have proved highly controversial. \u00b7 This article was amended on Monday February 25 2008 as a result of a subediting error.

He is also a 53-year-old rap star with several hits to his name, a cool line in designer specs, and an avid female following. Asked during an interview in Taipei about next month&apos;s presidential election - and a planned simultaneous referendum on whether Taiwan should apply for UN membership - Shieh dispensed with pro forma answers. Instead he rose to his feet, dropped a shoulder, extended his arms to a startled audience of two, and launched into a quasi-tuneful rap song of his own making. The printed word cannot do justice to what followed. But Shieh&apos;s message was unmistakable: Taiwan&apos;s voters should back the UN proposal - which China believes is a blatant bid by its &quot;renegade province&quot; legally to assert its independence. &quot;UN for Taiwan. Taiwan number one&quot;, chorused the minister again and again, tapping his feet and shaking his head. The song is available as a CD. Maybe it sounds better with backing singers. Shieh&apos;s super-cool crooning in support of the UN vote and the Democratic Progressive party&apos;s (DPP) presidential candidate, Frank Hsieh, is catchy to some ears - but may still end in tears. Polls suggest the rival Nationalist party, or Kuomintang (KMT), is set to follow its landslide parliamentary election victory last month with a return to the presidential palace. A charm offensive by the telegenic KMT candidate, the former Taipei mayor Ma Ying-jeou, has earned him an estimated 10-point lead. Ma is promising better relations with China after eight years of tense sparring between Beijing and Taiwan&apos;s retiring DPP president, Chen Shui-bian. DPP stalwarts dismiss Ma as a milksop. But although Hsieh says he too will improve cross-straits ties, many Taiwanese appear to believe the Nationalists have a better chance of conciliating the old enemy. Opponents say the prospect of a clean sweep for the KMT, and a resulting bigger say for China in the island&apos;s affairs, is deeply worrying. They warn Taiwan&apos;s hard-won democratic freedoms, secured in 1996 after decades of KMT-led martial law, could be fatally compromised - and that politically, economically and diplomatically, China is inexorably winning its battle to &quot;recover&quot; Taiwan. &quot;The public must elect a [president] who is capable, loves Taiwan and is determined to protect the country&apos;s sovereignty,&quot; DPP vice-presidential candidate Su Tseng-chang said this week. &quot;We are calling on voters to help preserve democratic politics.&quot; Hsiao Bi-khim, DPP campaign manager and former MP, said the election could be a turning point. &quot;We are worried about all the institutions of state, including the presidency and the judiciary, being monopolised by a single, unreformed party.&quot; As US regional influence weakened, China&apos;s leverage over Taiwan&apos;s affairs was steadily growing, she said. With the Olympic games approaching, China had halted overt military threats. But Beijing was increasingly successful in denying the island &quot;international space&quot; by blocking its membership of organisations such as the World Health Organisation and the UN. In a week when Washington recognised Kosovo&apos;s independence, Hsiao suggested it was particularly galling for pro-western, democratic Taiwan, the world&apos;s 20th-largest economy with a human rights record far superior to Beijing&apos;s, to be told by the US and Britain not to &quot;provoke&quot; China by holding a UN membership referendum. KMT supporters say fears of a Chinese backdoor takeover are wildly exaggerated. Lin Bih-jaw, chairman of the Prospect Foundation, said Ma has no intention of kowtowing to Beijing if he wins. The DPP was losing the race because of Chen&apos;s mistakes, he said, and because most Taiwanese, worried about economic issues, wanted improved trade and other ties with the mainland. Guo Jiann-jong, of the independent Taiwan Thinktank, said the country&apos;s growing economic dependence on China was inescapable. About 40% of all exports now went to China and investment in the mainland represented a &quot;dangerously high&quot; 2.65% of Taiwan&apos;s total GDP. An estimated 1 million Taiwanese live or work in China. But economic cooperation was not bringing political progress, Guo said. &quot;China is deliberately encouraging Taiwan to be dependent. Maybe China does not want a political understanding. Maybe it wants control.&quot; Back at the information ministry, Shieh is no longer jigging about and has returned to his chair. But he continues to wax lyrical about Taiwan&apos;s right to UN membership. &quot;The problem is not Taiwan; the problem is China,&quot; he said. Taiwan is a beacon of light not only for China but all of Asia. We have proved that democracy can work in a Chinese culture.&quot; &quot;If there was no military threat [from China], everyone would want Taiwan to be a separate, sovereign, free and democratic nation and a good friend to China. We just want to be treated fairly by the rest of the world.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/25/television.pressandpublishing", "publicationDate": "2008-02-25T07:02:27Z", "tags": ["Television industry", "Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Ching told reporters that he had never acted against China&apos;s national interest, and had never been in possession of state secrets or given any to Taiwan."], "title": "Dispatches", "article": "Documentary Whicker returns to the small screen With viewers currently flocking to watch veteran presenters, from Bruce Forsyth to Sir David Attenborough, it is hardly surprising that BBC2 has rushed to commission the pioneer of the personality-led documentary: Alan Whicker. The four-part series, Alan Whicker&apos;s Journey of a Lifetime, due this autumn, will mix Whicker&apos;s memories, reflections and archive footage from 30 years of the hugely popular Whicker&apos;s World, in which Whicker lulled his subjects - the super-rich, the famous and the extraordinary, as mocked in the Monty Python spoof Whicker Island - into relaxing and dropping their guard. One never quite knew if he was envious, or a trifle disdainful of his subjects&apos; lives. There will be clips of the last interview given by Peter Sellers in 1979, in Beverly Hills, in which he predicted his imminent death; Whicker with Paul Getty; and an eerie interview with Papa Doc, the Haiti dictator. But there will also be fresh material, as Whicker revisits some of his most famous interviewees and haunts. His list of requests includes the Sultan of Brunei, one of his last interviews in 1992; Baroness (Fiona) von Thyssen; and the self-styled Prince Leonard and his Serene Highness Princess Shirley, a western Australian farmer and wife who fell out with the authorities and declared their Hutt River holding a principality. (Whicker was knighted and made an ambassador.)  Though Whicker was loath to film in Britain, the series will take a detour to Solihull, where he was the first to go inside the Poor Clares&apos; convent 40 years ago. Another revisit will be to Kurt and Kathy Wagner, a Hollywood plastic surgeon and his wife, who he practised on, now retired to Florida. The series is executive produced by independent producer September Films chairman David Green who, as a young director at Yorkshire Television, made 24 episodes of Whicker&apos;s World. &quot;He is a major TV star and to anyone over 40 he has been a part of their upbringing. He is the David Niven of journalism with the charm of a bygone age,&quot; Green says. &quot;People would open up for him. That&apos;s what he did for factual television.&quot;  Since Whicker&apos;s World petered out in the early 1990s, there have been two memorable sightings of the star, now well into his eighties - Whicker&apos;s War on Channel 4 in 2004, a well-received account of his experiences in the second world war as part of the first allied landings at Anzio, Italy, and, in 2006, a set of ads for Travelocity. Whicker was unable to take my call. He&apos;s on holiday, on a boat, somewhere in the Caribbean. As Green says, television is his life, he sees this series as a semicolon. Not a full stop. Press Women, science and representation What influences women to pursue a career in science? According to new research, female representation in the media, or the lack of it, could be a key reason.  Researchers examining 1,500 articles in the areas of science, engineering and technology over a six-month period found that five male scientists were quoted for every female scientist. The study, commissioned by the UK Resource Centre for Women in Science Engineering and Technology, also found that journalists are more likely to comment on appearance when writing about women. Comments included: &quot;The 55-year-old academic&apos;s mane of blonde hair, her short, navy, voluminous skirt teamed with a Vivienne Westwood jacket and knee-length boots sets a high benchmark&quot; (Sunday Times) as opposed to the rather more cerebral musings on the appearances of male scientists such as &quot;His full white beard is worn more in homage to Charles Darwin than the Almighty&quot; (Observer). Laura Drane, director of the Manchester Science Festival, frequently seeks to challenge the &quot;male&quot; image of science by acting as a media spokesperson herself. &quot;You do get lots of women talking about science on television and in the papers,&quot; she says. &quot;But it does tend to be about health and childcare and psychology, and less about physical sciences such as astrophysics.&quot; But that isn&apos;t just the case for women, says Dr Cicely Marston, a senior lecturer at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, who is less concerned with the numbers of women scientists quoted than with the types of science that the media are interested in.  &quot;I would be delighted if high-quality researchers were represented in the media - male or female. What is rather depressing is the sort of &apos;science&apos; that is covered tends to be trivial and often ridiculous. If those types of stories are represented by men rather than women, it&apos;s damaging to morale only because it brings the scientific endeavour in general into disrepute.&quot; Human rights Beijing urged to free jailed journalists The Hong Kong journalist Ching Cheong has called on China to release all political prisoners, following his own release earlier this month. &quot;This year is the 30th anniversary of China&apos;s reform and opening and our first Olympics. I hope the Beijing government will announce an amnesty to help create greater social harmony,&quot; he said. Arrested in 2005, Ching was convicted of spying while working as a reporter in China for Singapore&apos;s Straits Times newspaper. He has always professed his innocence. Ching told reporters that he had never acted against China&apos;s national interest, and had never been in possession of state secrets or given any to Taiwan. He said he had given his laptop to the Chinese authorities on his arrest because he &quot;had nothing to hide&quot;. That faith in Chinese justice was tested during almost three years in detention. &quot;While I was in prison I had started to doubt my own values, my ideals and principles, things like being patriotic, honest, being open and frank, because those values apparently, at the time, had let me down,&quot; he said. Ching&apos;s career had long been shaped by his pro-China views. Before working for the Straits Times, he was deputy editor of a Chinese mouthpiece in Hong Kong, the Wen Wei Po newspaper. That is what made his detention so chilling for other journalists.  But the joy surrounding Ching&apos;s release has been dissipated by the four-year jail sentence imposed on Lu Gengsong, a freelance journalist, this month. Lu had written several articles for overseas websites criticising corrupt officials and reported on the trial of a human rights activist. &quot;China must stop sending journalists to jail because it does not like their reporting. As the Olympics approach, it is time for China to show it can abide by international standards of press freedom and release the 28 reporters in jail,&quot; said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, an international pressure group. The committee&apos;s newly published report lists China as the world&apos;s leading jailer of journalists for the ninth consecutive year in 2007. Ching refused to answer questions about his treatment in jail, saying only that it was better than for other inmates. He suffered a series of health problems, ranging from stomach pain and insomnia to irregular heartbeat, and was hospitalised at least twice. He admitted to the Straits Times that he considered suicide. &quot;I began to lose confidence, lose hope. When you are in such a situation, the downward spiral begins to kick in and the end result is to commit suicide.&quot;  Some think that Ching&apos;s early release is part of Beijing&apos;s efforts to improve its image before the Olympics in August. Ching was not so sure. &quot;I cannot say for sure, but I&apos;m sure in China someone is advocating a more lenient policy. I think every Chinese would want their country to be more democratic. Me, too. Right now I am still rather disoriented after being held for almost three years, so what exactly will I do? I need to think a bit.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/25/pressandpublishing2", "publicationDate": "2008-02-25T07:12:52Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media"], "sentences": ["When a prominent television actor in Taiwan hanged himself in 2005, the newspapers gave the story an average of between one and two pages every day for a fortnight, with graphic descriptions of how he did it."], "title": "More consideration, less volume", "article": "Even by Daily Mail standards, it was breathtaking hypocrisy. In a leader last Thursday, the paper solemnly insisted that &quot;the spate of suicides in Bridgend, which has been leading the news on the BBC and in some so-called quality papers, must be reported with the utmost care&quot;. The Mail had &quot;made every effort to carry the story responsibly and to provide phone numbers for teenagers and parents who need help and guidance&quot;. Yet when the Bridgend &quot;suicide cult&quot; story reached the national press on January 23, it was the Mail that gave it most prominence. It led its front page with &quot;The internet suicide cult?&quot;, the interrogative being, as any headline writer knows, neither here nor there. It pictured seven young people who had hanged themselves and detected &quot;chilling links&quot;. Inside, across a double-page spread headed &quot;They lived and died online&quot;, the pictures were repeated, along with biographical particulars and details of where each suicide took place. The pictures included the most recent death, which was also the first female one: 17-year-old Natasha Randall, the &quot;wild child who surfed her way to suicide&quot;, looking glamorous in a low-cut top. &quot;Her favourite social networking site,&quot; we learned, was &quot;overflowing with tributes&quot;. The police theory, according to the Mail, was that internet memorial sites were fashionable and young people were killing themselves for the prestige. If so, the Mail delivered. There was no phone number that day, nor on either of the subsequent days when the Mail ran follow-ups, including one on a 15-year-old&apos;s attempted suicide which contained precise details of what she wrapped round her neck. The only numbers I can find in that week&apos;s press were in the &quot;so-called quality papers&quot;. Yet can we really believe, as some suggest, that press coverage persuades more people to commit suicide? Does anybody under 30 read the Mail? Can a novel by Goethe, cited by several commentators last week, be blamed for a spate of suicides across 18th-century Europe, when the population was mostly illiterate? I had assumed this was just another example of how the poor old meejah always gets the blame and, as an editor, it would never have occurred to me to suppress a story about suicide. Now I&apos;ve looked at the evidence and I&apos;m not so sure. Oxford University&apos;s centre for suicide research looked at 90 studies across the world. More than half had found evidence that suicides covered in the media - whether in newspapers, films or TV news and drama - were followed by an increase in the number of cases. None had identified a fall.  Celebrities, as you might expect, have special influence. When a prominent television actor in Taiwan hanged himself in 2005, the newspapers gave the story an average of between one and two pages every day for a fortnight, with graphic descriptions of how he did it. Compared with previous years, male suicides, mostly by hanging, rose sharply over the following month. Similarly, when the press in other Asian countries reported cases of death by deliberate inhalation of charcoal fumes or by swallowing anti-freeze, suicides rose dramatically, and so did the use of such methods. Suicide statistics are tricky. They don&apos;t take account of unsuccessful attempts and the numbers are so small that apparently significant increases can happen by chance. But Bridgend suggests we should worry at least a little about the media&apos;s role. When the South Wales Echo first reported the story on January 17, under the headline &quot;Why are our youngsters killing themselves?&quot;, the incidence of suicide in the previous year had been about one a month. How far they were linked and whether there were &quot;pacts&quot; are matters of dispute, but it seems likely the internet played some role. Nevertheless, it was undoubtedly the press that put the numbers together to announce &quot;a death town&quot; and possibly a cult. The net may have its own agenda and momentum, but the mainstream media still prompt most of its chattering points. In barely a month after the January 17 report, there were five more suicides (plus at least one failed attempt), all by hanging. If charged with giving too much attention to irresponsible behaviour among young people, newspapers plead that they wish to &quot;warn&quot; parents of &quot;dangers&quot;. Those are the terms in which the Mail runs salacious stories each summer about sexual cavortings among teenagers in Mediterranean resorts. The same excuse is trotted out for the Bridgend story. &quot;Personally, I have some misgivings about even writing about teenage suicide,&quot; wrote the Times&apos;s Ben Macintyre (having swallowed the misgivings in time to write 1,500 words), &quot;for fear it might alert young people to the possibility. But unless parents are made aware of the dangers lurking in the internet there is perhaps a greater danger of self-destructive social networks developing. . . unnoticed and unregulated.&quot; The Mail leader argued: &quot;All of us. . . need to engage with this problem.&quot; But it is hardly rocket science to suggest our behaviour is influenced by what we know of the behaviour of people like ourselves. That&apos;s why hotels display notices telling you &quot;most guests who have stayed in this room choose not to have clean linen every day&quot;. Many of the things on which journalists (and politicians) expend so much energy warning about and denouncing are, in fact, normalised by the attention given to them. I suspect something like that has happened with teenagers carrying guns and knives in south London. If a male teenager believed the media coverage, he might think it foolish to go out unarmed and, if he happened upon one of those lists of gangs, complete with maps, that the papers print from time to time, he might think it best to join one. You could make similar points about media coverage of drugs and binge drinking. Clearly, if reporting of all undesirable behaviour were banned, there would be nothing left in the papers.  Besides, there are enough people who already think the press is part of a giant conspiracy of suppression - about the truth behind 9/11, for example - without giving them genuine cause for complaint. I suppose we must tolerate newspapers announcing, from time to time, that we are all going to die of bird flu, falling meteorites or a breeze off the North Sea. But where lives are truly at risk, perhaps they can turn the volume down a touch, and refrain from using words and phrases such as &quot;epidemic&quot;, &quot;cult&quot;, &quot;agonising questions&quot;, &quot;death town&quot;, &quot;out of control&quot; and &quot;our increasingly alienated young&quot;. Boo! Hurrah! It&apos;s the Castro panto season Some newspapers have been awfully rude about that nice Fidel Castro, who announced last week that he won&apos;t be returning as Cuban dictator - sorry, president. &quot;Forty-nine years of revolution, confrontation, poverty and interminable speeches,&quot; was the Telegraph&apos;s headline.  As editor of the New Statesman, I wouldn&apos;t have dared. The most vitriolic postbag I ever received followed a piece that mildly criticised Castro&apos;s habit of locking people up for things such as circulating books. Many NS readers regard criticism of Castro rather as Telegraph readers used to regard criticism of the Queen Mother.

For his part, Suchi, a KMT campaign manager, claimed the DPP might be planning to stage a mock military incident in the Taiwan Strait to scare voters. Attention grabbing though they are, both sides&apos; doom-and-gloom scenarios ignore strategic and economic realities, diplomats and academics say. One is the unprecedented level of diplomatic cooperation between the US and China attained since Hu replaced Jiang Zemin at the helm in Beijing. Bilateral political and military exchanges are now at the highest level ever since the Chinese revolution. While they often disagree, the two countries are discussing international issues such as North Korea, Sudan, terrorism and Iran in a way that only a few years ago would have been nigh impossible. A decline to 19% in the number of Taiwanese who support de jure independence meanwhile reflects strengthening economic, social and cultural links. Taiwanese businesses have over $100bn invested in the mainland. Both presidential candidates promised at the weekend to develop direct-air links with China and promote trade and people-to-people ties. Lin Chong-pin, president of the International and Cross-Straits Foundation in Taiwan, argues that the real, often unnoticed trend in Taiwan-China relations is not towards military conflict but towards ever closer cooperation, fostered principally by Hu&apos;s switch towards non-military methods of &quot;recovering&quot; the island. In short, he says, China has renounced counter-productive threats of force and discovered &quot;soft power&quot;. &quot;A number of [Chinese] policies have remained consistent,&quot; Lin said. These included the Straits missile build-up, efforts to deny Taiwan &quot;international living space&quot; by curbing its diplomatic and institutional ties, and insistence on the &quot;one China principle&quot;. But at the same time Hu had scrapped Jiang&apos;s unification timetable, de-emphasised military solutions, soft-pedalled &quot;anti-secession&quot; measures, encouraged political and economic contacts with the KMT and business groups, and &quot;actively reached out to scholars, journalists and artists&quot; in Taiwan. In an internal high-level party meeting in August last year, Lin said Hu told the People&apos;s Liberation Army that its &quot;major task&quot; remained war with Taiwan. But he warned war would entail several major negative consequences: it would potentially ruin the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, disrupt China&apos;s foreign relations, damage its international reputation, reduce external investment, impair its economic development and modernisation programmes - and cause a lot of casualties. Even once the Games finish in August, Hu&apos;s other reasons for pursuing a non-military solution will still hold good. And while the Chinese president remained determined to bring Taiwan back into the fold, he had perfected another &quot;soft power&quot; method of applying - and defusing - pressure, Lin said. When Taiwan&apos;s behaviour caused concern these days, Beijing simply complained to Washington. US arm-twisting usually did the rest. US post-ideological thinking appears similarly pragmatic. With so much else on its plate in the Middle East and Afghanistan, and with its reliance on China&apos;s financial and diplomatic goodwill growing, the last thing the Bush administration wants is a flare-up in the Taiwan Strait. More than in the past, and even as the hawks mouth and fume, China, the US, and most Taiwanese are finding common ground for peace. In the longer term, barring major crises or miscalculations, a Hong Kong-style autonomy compromise beckons."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2008/mar/04/anunusualpairoftopics", "publicationDate": "2008-03-04T11:45:28Z", "tags": ["Paul Raymond"], "sentences": ["It may also be used to strengthen the missile barrage facing Taiwan, which also worries the White House."], "title": "Morning conference: Soho, by way of China", "article": "An unusual pair of topics shared today&apos;s discussion at the morning editorial conference -- Paul Raymond and China&apos;s defence budget. First, the  &apos;king of Soho&apos;, who died yesterday, or, more accurately, his estate.  The Paul Raymond Organisation and its property development company, Ilona House Securities, owns around 400 properties in Soho including prestigious restaurants and clubs worth up to \u00a31.5bn according to figures used in today&apos;s  obituary. One colleague reminded us that Soho is one of the final pieces of central London relatively untouched by developers and they have been itching to get some of it into their portfolios. However, the Raymond organisation has refused to sell, until now. Maybe those who now run the business -- among them his brother Philip Quinn and nephew Mark Quinn -- may keep family policy unchanged. But if they do decide to divest then it is possible that the character of Soho might face a major change unless Westminster council decides otherwise. The People&apos;s Army The character of the eastern Pacific might be changing too as  China increases its defence budget by 17% or 18%. Does this mean a superpower arms race? Probably not, said a colleague recently returned from Beijing. China&apos;s defence budget is still less than a tenth of that of the US and it doesn&apos;t have a nuclear arsenal anything like America&apos;s or, for that matter, Russia&apos;s. It is a regional superpower, though, and this worries Japan and the US. The increased defence cash will be partly spent on subs, which will deny those other two powers the unquestioned dominance they have had in that part of the Pacific since the second world war. The US has also expressed concern about advances in space and cyberspace technology. It may also be used to strengthen the missile barrage facing Taiwan, which also worries the White House. There are already around 1,000 missiles trained on the island that China regards as a &apos;rogue province&apos;. The historic trend is for the country&apos;s defence budget to rise to maintain its position as a regional superpower. It rose by around the same amount  last year and will no doubt have been spurred on by  India&apos;s  recent announcement of a $45bn programme of military modernisation. However, China&apos;s main priority at the moment is economic development and modernisation of its infrastructure. Its major foreign policy is a &apos;happy neighbours&apos; one with territorial disputes between it and Russia and India having been solved.

But some of the cash will go on hardware, allowing China to conduct a war &quot;under IT-based conditions&quot; capacity, Jiang Enzhu, a spokesman for the country&apos;s parliament told agency reporters.  Speaking before the opening session of the National People&apos;s Congress tomorrow, he said the rise was &quot;moderate&quot; because it came from a low base, despite a substantial increase last year. The news comes the day after a Pentagon report expressed concerns about the development of China&apos;s military, including an apparent rise in cyber-espionage as well as its increased strike capacity and testing of an anti-satellite weapon last year.  It argued that the People&apos;s Liberation Army was &quot;pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration wars along its periphery against high-tech adversaries&quot;. It also suggested China&apos;s true defence budget was two to three times the official figure last year. That would still leave it well below the United States budget, which has also risen substantially to $623bn (\u00a3314bn) for 2008.  Jiang told reporters: &quot;In recent years the Chinese government has moderately increased its spending on national defence on the basis of sustained, steady and fast economic growth and rapid build-up of government revenues. &quot;These increases were of a compensatory nature to make up for the weak defence foundation.&quot; Jiang said China&apos;s military spending was 1.4% of its gross domestic product last year, compared with 4.6% in the US and 3% in Britain. The budget rise prompted Japan&apos;s defence ministry to urge China to enhance transparency and address international concerns.  Figures for 2006 from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute suggest China lagged behind the US, UK and France in total spending, but in purchasing power parity was second to the US, spending the equivalent of $188bn to the US&apos;s $529bn. Trefor Moss, Asia Pacific editor at Jane&apos;s Defence Weekly, said it was hard to know the true scale and nature of the country&apos;s military development, but added: &quot;For a long time China&apos;s spending was clearly quite tiny comparatively, and the army was quite basic.

The increase, announced a day after a Pentagon report criticising China for a &quot;lack of transparency&quot; in security affairs, brought demands from Japan and the US for Beijing to explain recent big increases in defence spending more clearly.  Funding will rise from about 350bn yuan (\u00a325bn) to 418bn yuan, according to the National People&apos;s Congress, which begins its annual session today. Jiang Enzhu said that double-digit increases for much of the last two decades had been moderate, adding: &quot;These increases were of a compensatory nature to make up for the weak defence foundation.&quot; Chinese military spending fell sharply as a proportion of government expenditure and arguably in real terms in the 1980s. Jiang said the extra money would provide better training and meals for more than 2 million soldiers in the People&apos;s Liberation Army and cover increased fuel and salary costs. According to one report, he also suggested it would help China prepare for a conflict &quot;under IT-based conditions&quot;. But the Pentagon report suggested China&apos;s true defence budget was two to three times the official figure last year - but still well behind the US budget, which has also risen substantially to $623bn (\u00a3314bn) for 2008. The difference in buying power also skews comparisons. The most recent figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, for 2006, suggest that China lagged behind the US, UK and France in its total spending that year - but in terms of purchasing power was second only to the US, spending the equivalent of $188bn to America&apos;s $529bn.  The report expresses concerns about China&apos;s increased strategic strike capability and anti-satellite weapon tests and states that &quot;numerous&quot; intrusions into computer networks, including some owned by the US government, seem to have originated in China.  It argues that the People&apos;s Liberation Army &quot;is pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration wars along its periphery against hi-tech adversaries&quot;.  It added: &quot;The lack of transparency in China&apos;s military and security affairs poses risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation.&quot; But the Chinese foreign ministry attacked the report as unfair, inaccurate and an example of &quot;cold war thinking&quot;. Its spokesman, Qin Gang, added: &quot;We do not seek expansion. The purpose is to safeguard our sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.&quot; He denied Chinese involvement in infiltrating computer networks, saying they too were victims of hackers.  &quot;We hope related countries can work together to tackle this problem. If the US has an accusation to make, it should produce the evidence,&quot; he said. China and the US have shown signs of a rapprochement in recent years despite tensions, last week agreeing to set up a military hotline. But yesterday a state department spokesman said the US and other nations wanted to understand China&apos;s motives in raising spending so sharply. Japan&apos;s defence ministry also urged China to enhance transparency and address international concerns. Trefor Moss, Asia Pacific editor at Jane&apos;s Defence Weekly, said it was hard to know the true scale and nature of the country&apos;s military development, but added: &quot;For a long time China&apos;s spending was clearly quite tiny comparatively, and the army was quite basic.

The last elections in Iraq, by contrast, were &quot;a triumph for democracy&quot;. The forthcoming elections in Zimbabwe and Iran have been pre-emptively dismissed as a travesty. Those in Pakistan were, by general consent, an affirmation of freedom. Democracies are like two-year-olds: adorable when they belong to you, but you never see them as others do. Downing Street had a problem with the new Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, since the procedure by which he was chosen was little short of feudal. Yet Gordon Brown could hardly slap him on the back as the victor in some great electoral tourney. Medvedev might hit back with a joke about western leaders also being slid into office by friends and predecessors - and at least he had an election of sorts. The British prime minister wisely muttered something noncommittal and put down the phone. We are in the midst of an astonishing festival of elections in countries as diverse as Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Taiwan, Kenya, Georgia, Armenia, Cyprus, Thailand, Serbia, Zimbabwe, Spain and Italy. And then there is the daddy of them all, America&apos;s primaries. Only one generalisation can be made of them, that no generalisation applies. Democracy is the new Christianity. It is the chosen faith of western civilisation, and carrying it abroad is the acceptable face of the Crusader spirit. In reinterpreting Tony Blair&apos;s interventionism, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, spoke recently of the west&apos;s &quot;mission&quot; to promote democracy, even by economic and military warfare. With his eyes fixed on Iraq and Afghanistan, Miliband contrived both to assert that &quot;we cannot impose democratic norms&quot; and then demand that we do just that. The truth is that neither Blair nor Miliband, nor the rest of us, has any idea of what we are about. We expect far too much of democracy, and of others who claim to espouse it. We treat it as a rigid set of rules from which no wavering is tolerable. The ballot is a sacred rite and any contamination is blasphemy. We incant the Nicene creed when we should stick to the Sermon on the Mount. Let us upend the customary analysis. At one extreme stands an ideal: democracy as the full table d&apos;h\u00f4te of secret ballots, civil rights, a free press, freedom of assembly, balance of power and discretionary local government. It applies in pathetically few states, even in the supposedly democratic west. Menken reasonably dismissed it as &quot;a dream, to be put in the same category as Arcadia, Santa Claus and Heaven&quot;. At the other, more crowded extreme is a rough and ready electoral process exerting some form of restraint on a ruling elite. One of Africa&apos;s nastiest dictators, Zimbabwe&apos;s Robert Mugabe, regards as a genuine threat the electoral challenge of his former finance minister, Simba Makoni, in an election Mugabe feels he cannot avoid. In Kenya what is significant is not that the leadership rigged an election but that the outcome was denied popular consent, and order collapsed as a result. The same happened in Serbia in 2000. Even Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, hero of Venezuela, had to concede defeat last autumn after a referendum denied his bid to rule for life. Likewise Pakistan&apos;s military dictator, Pervez Musharraf, felt obliged to hold reasonably open elections, despite the likelihood that they would lead to his downfall. In Iran, thoroughly polluted elections still threaten to undermine the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is milking the popularity bonanza America has handed him in Iraq. In all these cases some ideal of democracy is exerting its mystic force. Even where consent is presumed, as in Russia, the ballot is the ghost in the machine. It is the ultimate legitimiser, the point to which all power aspires and from which it measures its own backsliding. Russia&apos;s elections were imperfect, their casual and crude corruption by Vladimir Putin yet another way of displaying his autocratic machismo. He may have failed to live up to the standards the west &quot;expects&quot;. But he appears to have correctly read the mood of his people, who simply want a strong hand on the wheel for as long as possible. I cannot see what purpose is therefore served by hurling abuse at these states. Russia&apos;s path to political emancipation is tentative, if not in reverse. That country has never ticked more than a handful of democracy&apos;s boxes, yet is still incomparably freer than under communism. Its pastiche of monopoly capitalism - Putin&apos;s &quot;managed democracy&quot; - so contrasts with the chaos of the 1990s that even sophisticated Russians tell western interviewers that they would happily buy stability and discipline at the expense of another such gamble. We can tell them they are wrong until the cows come home. But we did not live in Russia in the 1990s. Western leaders, as they beat a cringing path to the door of China&apos;s dictators, buy this argument from Beijing. Why do they expect Moscow to behave differently? The famous &quot;raising of human rights issues&quot; by western visitors to China, before talking hard cash, now has the familiarity of a tea ceremony. It is these same leaders who, having destroyed order in Iraq and Afghanistan, hail them as democracies when in reality they are anarchies, failed states. To vote for a ruler in a fortress is not to participate in a democracy. There is just no point in the sonorous moralising of western NGOs characterised by the (normally admirable) Human Rights Watch. It complains that &quot;by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats, without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful, influential democrats risk undermining human rights&quot;.  What are these words &quot;allowing ... demanding ... undermining&quot;? Their major premise is not just western superiority, to which I might subscribe, but western potency and, most extraordinary (and illegal), a western right to global sovereignty. The assumption behind &quot;demand&quot; has lain at the root of so much useless bloodshed over the past half century that a sense of history might surely counsel humility. And this from a Europe whose rulers in Brussels propose using opinion polls as the basis for their legislative legitimacy, without a peep of complaint from democracy&apos;s self-appointed guardians. Democracy is an invitation to hypocrisy. Let us practise it ourselves and, if we must preach, preach by example.simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/mar/05/crocodilefishingsnaptheone1", "publicationDate": "2008-03-05T09:43:00Z", "tags": ["Australasia holidays", "World news"], "sentences": ["Chang Po-yu, a vet, had his armed snapped off by a croc in a Taiwan zoo."], "title": "Snapshot: the croc-curious tourist who (just) got away", "article": "&quot;One minute I was leaning over the boat, teasing it for a picture.

The menu at this kitsch pre-war eatery includes 21 - yes, 21 - varieties of pancake, but the star of the show is the chocolate egg cream, a fizzy drink from yester-year that combines milk and chocolate syrup with seltzer - no egg, no cream. Once readily available across the city, the egg cream now survives only because of characters such as Gus Vlahadhas, who took over the family business from his father Tom. Nearby is another symbol of old New York, Ebbets Field - once the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers, now a housing project. I headed to Tom&apos;s a few weeks back, wondering if the restaurant ever played host to the Boys of Summer for a pre- or post-game bite. I entered the old eatery seeking an authentic egg cream and answers to my Dodger questions. The extroverted owner was more than willing to talk about the old days, so I fired away. Did the Dodgers eat here? What were they like? Were you sad when they left? Gus&apos;s answers were surprising. Yes, the Dodgers spent a lot of time at the joint, but not a lot of money - as Brooklyn royalty, they expected their tab to be covered by the house so, no, he didn&apos;t miss the cheap ballplayers at all. Shocking statements coming from a living part of borough history. Not once had I heard a Brooklynite utter disdain for the long-lost local nine, the storied teams that the borough bowed down to - these were the players that won seven National League pennants in the 1940s and 50s, and the franchise&apos;s first World Series title in 1955. I chalked it up as an isolated incident. To their fans in Flatbush and beyond, the Dodgers were affectionately known as Dem Bums, but to Gus the nickname took on a different meaning. Owner Walter O&apos;Malley moved the Dodgers to Los Angeles after the 1957 season, and those at Tom&apos;s Restaurant no longer had to worry about freeloading ballplayers clogging their booths. Just over 50 years have passed since the Dodgers packed up and headed west, and the club is once again on the move. When the team left Brooklyn, they maintained their small but significant presence on the east coast as, since 1948, Vero Beach, Florida, has been their Spring Training home. The complex known as Dodgertown has helped to keep the teams&apos; pre-Los Angeles history alive. Modern day Dodgers such as Jeff Kent and Brad Penny are preparing for the 2008 season in the very same Holman Stadium that Brooklyn legends Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella practiced the &quot;Dodger Way&quot;, a fact that&apos;s not lost on the nostalgic fans that make the trip. According to team owner Frank McCourt, there are too few of those fans making the pilgrimage to Dodgertown these days. He says the team loses out on revenues because of the distance between their winter home and LA fan base, so the Dodgers will move to a new complex in Glendale, Arizona, next spring - that is, if their facility is ready in time. If not, this awkward and sad end to an era will drag into next season. Town officials, already upset that the team that defined its existence is deserting its citizens, are furious about the Dodgers&apos; decision to break camp early in order to play an exhibition series in China. And the roughly 20,000 souls living in Vero Beach can&apos;t be happy with the rumour that the Baltimore Orioles may be moving in - Birdland doesn&apos;t quite have the same appeal as Dodgertown. Dodger ownership is abandoning its home turf - again. First O&apos;Malley, now McCourt, a man with little taste for baseball tradition, the same person who tried to buy his home-town Boston Red Sox with the idea of moving them out of Fenway Park. Keeping that in mind, it should come as no surprise that he is choosing to end one of baseball&apos;s longest running nostalgia shows. Yes, there will always be Jackie Robinson Day to invoke memories of Brooklyn&apos;s baseball past, but the Dodgers leaving Dodgertown represents the end of the franchise&apos;s ties to Brooklyn, and the elimination of the last remaining link between a borough and its Bums. Hey buddy, can you spare a dime? Team GB was unable to raise the funds needed to send the club to baseball&apos;s upcoming Olympic qualifying tournament in Taiwan, and have ceded their place to Germany. UK Sport denied Team GB a request for \u00a340,000, citing the elimination of the sport after the 2008 Games in Beijing as a reason behind its decision. The sad move comes after Team GB&apos;s recent second-place finish at the European Championships. Josh Chetwynd, who co-hosts Major League Baseball&apos;s live coverage on Five and also played on the national team in five European Championships, said: &quot;The stance that UK Sport took on this matter was extremely disappointing and, in my mind, showed a poor sense of how to properly allocate funds. &quot;As shadow sports minister Hugh Robertson pointed out in parliament not too long ago, UK Sport spent \u00a330,000 to send delegates to a conference on sporting legacy in Barbados. It seems to me this money should have been spent first and foremost on athletes competing - like those on the GB baseball team - rather than on perks for bureaucrats.&quot; This depressing debacle is just the latest kick in the teeth for Team GB. Had the IOC not dropped both hard and softball from the Olympic slate, it would be looking forward to an automatic berth at the 2012 London Games, and a possible surge in the sport&apos;s popularity in the UK. I wonder if anyone from British Baseball hit on Liverpool co-owner and Texas Rangers owner Tom Hicks for a dime or two."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/mar/07/acerleapsoverdellinnotebo", "publicationDate": "2008-03-07T22:27:45Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Business", "Computing", "Technology", "Acer"], "sentences": [" The notebook PC market grew by 41 % to 33 million units in the fourth quarter of 2007, and by 14% quarter-on-quarter, according to DisplaySearch, reports DigiTimes in Taiwan."], "title": "Acer leaps over Dell in notebook PC market", "article": " The notebook PC market grew by 41 % to 33 million units in the fourth quarter of 2007, and by 14% quarter-on-quarter, according to DisplaySearch, reports DigiTimes in Taiwan.

You&apos;re going to the middle of the world,&quot; says the Quito taxi driver, turning to the English backpackers in the backseat, while simultaneously negotiating the city&apos;s mid-morning traffic. He&apos;s right first time. The equator is one of the Ecuadorian capital&apos;s biggest attractions - even though GPS devices have recently revealed the much-photographed line to be off centre by over 200 metres. &quot;Then, after Quito, you are going to Ba\u00f1os and then ... &quot; He reels off the standard tour of Ecuador, a spot-on prediction that makes the girls in the back laugh aloud. Backpacking has changed. What was supposed to open your eyes to new countries and new cultures, these days often involves hanging out with other travellers, often from your own country, while following the same carbon-copy route, Lonely Planet checklist in hand.  There&apos;s no point being snobby about it; many of us have done the same. But this time when it came to planning a three-month trip around central and south America, I decided to take a different approach. I wanted to find out whether travel-networking websites, such as couchsurfing.com and hospitalityclub.org, live up to their hype. Serving as worldwide directories of people willing to share their time - and sometimes their home - with passing travellers, they have already gained cult-status among an established fanbase. Yet, in the mainstream, suprisingly few backpackers have heard of them; even fewer have put them to the test.  My first foray into travel networking came last year when I organised a weekend in Berlin packed with social engagements with people I met online. I was instantly hooked, moving on to use sites to enhance trips to Taiwan (exploring the night markets with Jennifer from yoursafeplanet.com) and, last month, having a Guatemalan called Igor surf my own north London couch.  Now I&apos;ve decided to embark on the biggest challenge yet: taking the experiment further afield and over a much longer time frame. Over the next three months, I&apos;ll be building my entire trip around meetings I&apos;ve prearranged with locals online, who I hope will help me explore their countries beyond the guidebooks.  So far, NGO employee Silvia has promised to show me how Bogata celebrates Easter; Panama City resident Gabriel has offered to take me kitesurfing at a near-deserted, out-of-city beach; and student Pierre-Charles says he&apos;ll introduce me to the &quot;realities of Caracas&quot;. (&quot;I hope you like revolutionary discussions,&quot; he writes, followed by a smiley face icon.)  So, if that&apos;s the grand plan, how did I end up in a taxi, with people I met at my hostel, taking the cliched trip to the &quot;Middle of the Earth&quot;?  I was actually en route to my first local contact, Fernanda from yoursafeplanet.com, a thirysomething mother of two who lives in Pusuqu\u00ed, a small residential neighbourhood a few minutes from the famed line.  Fernanda has been working with yoursafeplanet.com since it was founded just over a year ago. The site differs from most travel-networking sites by offering just one fully vetted contact per country. Such assurance comes at a price: \u00a345, with two thirds going to the in-country contact. Paying for friend? Not really. The idea is that the contact is also there to assist with travel plans, share contacts and help negotiate discounts at hotels.  For me, meeting Fernanda is less about her informal travel service (although I do appreciate her help fathoming bus routes and her generous offer for me to stay with her relatives in the highlands), and more about the chance to have a personal tour of Quito, with insights I probably wouldn&apos;t get with a group tour guide. We start with a walking tour of the city, passing through the beautifully restored colonial Old Town, which she says has &quot;really cleaned up&quot; in recent years, following a crackdown on illegal street trading that previously made the plazas unruly hotbeds for theft. We move on to Mercado de Santa Clara, negotiating our way through the crowds, breathing in smells of roasted meat and boiled sweetcorn, bundles of fresh herbs, and medicinal mixes that Fernanda describes as &quot;love potions&quot;.  As we make our way round the city, Fernanda gives me a crash course in Ecuadorian politics, which with seven presidents in 10 years is no easy task. Getting a local take on a country&apos;s politics is one of the bonuses of travel networking. Another is the glimpse I get of normal life. Talking to Fernanda&apos;s parents, playing with her kids, eating the local snack of cooked corn kernels are the sort of experiences that make this trip feel special. I feel like we&apos;re just getting started when I say goodbye to Fernanda, but I have to meet my second guide, Jose - a trumpet player I contacted through couchsurfing.com. Fernanda had provided the perfect overview of Quito and Ecuador, now I was keen to meet someone who could unlock a specific side of the city: its music. Jos\u00e9 looked like the best man for the job, a professional musician with a band called RoCola Bacalao (Xmyspace.com/larocolitaXX). We meet at the laidback Mango Tree bar.  Jos\u00e9 gives me list of music venues to check out: El Aguij\u00f3n (Calama E7-35) and El Pobre Diablo (Isabel La Cat\u00f3lica E12-06. &quot;Jazz and blues. Full of intellectual people. Or people trying to be intellectual&quot;). He especially recommends the underground vibe of La Bunga (Orellana 899). &quot;Even though it&apos;s in the middle of &apos;Gringolandia&apos;,&quot; he says, laughing over the local nickname for the Mariscal area, which, with its English signs, abundant internet cafes and traveller-friendly bars, is more than fair.  After all this talk of music and parties, I&apos;m itching for a night on the town but my meeting with Jos\u00e9 was postponed by one night, and I&apos;d already booked my overnight bus to meet my next contact. One drawback of this experiment is that, with a tight schedule of meeting after meeting, there&apos;s little room for rescheduling. My bus was heading to Loja, a small southern city which caught my eye after Ecuador.com proclaimed it to be the country&apos;s &quot;cultural and musical capital&quot;, with a famed music conservatory and a reputation for churning out artists. With a population of just 140,000, travel networkers were in more limited supply, but two profiles stood out. Itamar, a doctor on couchsurfing.com &quot;who reads anything, except get-rich and self-help books&quot;, replied almost immediately. Pablo, an artist from hospiltalityclub.org with a tortoise called Jim Morrison, proved more elusive.  I was particularly keen to meet Pablo for his artistic insight into the city. But, when I arrive - worse for wear after a 15-hour overnight bus trip - there&apos;s still no word from him. Starting to feel like a stalker, I send another email and leave a rambling message on his mobile. I draw the line at turning up at his house and I wonder if my keenness to meet has sent him into hiding in the Oriente jungle.  Fortunately, I still have Itamar, who fits me in between his medical missions into the country&apos;s wild interior. We meet in the lobby of the Grand Victoria (grandvictoriabh.com), the town&apos;s first boutique hotel, recently renovated to cater for growing tourism to Podocarpus national park. I had doubts about meeting men I&apos;d met online, but Itamar, 28 years old and smartly dressed, is the perfect gent. &quot;Vamos!&quot; he says. And off we go. I&apos;m bowled over by Loja. Dating back to 1548, it&apos;s one of the country&apos;s oldest cities. Grand city gates give way to vibrant historical murals and picturesque colonial plazas bordered by shaded walkways. As soon as I tell Itamar I&apos;m interested in the city&apos;s arts, he unveils hidden doorways leading to mini galleries and takes me to watch a teenage folk-dance rehearsal.  &quot;Everyone knows everyone in Loja,&quot; says Itamar. He offers introductions as we go along and, crucially, knows the best places to refuel: down-to-earth cafe El Tamal Lojano for an afternoon coffee and humita (a traditional corn and cheese sponge) and a bar in a converted house called La Siembra for beer and local music come evening.  It&apos;s a shame to leave Loja the next day, but Itamar has a date with the jungle and I have to meet my next contact, Marco, in Guayaquil.  Guayaquil has undergone a transformation in recent years from a city of filth and fear to a beacon of modernity, its crowning glory an immaculate riverside boardwalk, Malecon 2000. Marco proves as enthusiastic as my other hosts and we explore the city, ending the day with a beer on top of the Cerro Santa Ana viewpoint. Looking out across the river and sprawling city I wonder how the rest of the trip will pan out.  I&apos;m confident I&apos;ll be in good hands. My next port of call is Panama city where I&apos;m meeting couchsurfer Xili, who&apos;s on a high from her experience working as an extra on the latest James Bond movie, currently on location. By now, we&apos;ve exchanged so many emails she feels like an old friend.  Talking of &quot;old friends&quot;, I did eventually hear from Pablo, my stalkee in Loja. &quot;Sorry we couldn&apos;t meet,&quot; he wrote, citing family problems. &quot;Am sure you will enjoy Loja. It is very beautiful.&quot; He&apos;s not wrong.  \u00b7  STA Travel (0870 230 8512, statravel.co.uk) offers flights with Iberia from London to Quito, returning from Buenos Aires from \u00a3622 including taxes.

Email vicky.baker@theguardian.com Playing safe Meeting random people on the other side of the world through the internet? It&apos;s not the sort of idea that puts everyone at ease. However, realistically speaking, independent travel typically involves putting trust in strangers, even if it&apos;s simply choosing to hang out with fellow travellers in a nearby bar. Nonetheless caution is always advised. Here are some tips for staying safe when travel networking: \u00b7  Take advantage of the sites&apos; own safety precautions. Couchsurfing.com offers members a security grading \u2014 from 0 (ie anyone who signs up) to 3 (name and address verified by a small credit card payment) \u2014 along with the chance to be vouched for by a high-level, &quot;trusted&quot; member. Other sites, such as globalfreeloaders.com and hospitalityclub.org, require users to exchange passport numbers and advise people to check identity documents when they meet. \u00b7  Always meet in a public place and tell people who you are meeting. \u00b7  Check references left by other travellers. Most social network profiles include testimonials from people who have previously met the person via the site. \u00b7  Consider parting with a small amount of cash to use vetted contacts who have undergone police checks and provide official references, like those on yoursafeplanet.com. \u00b7  Don&apos;t be afraid to pull out of a meeting if it doesn&apos;t feel right and, above all, use common sense."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/16/drama.worldcinema", "publicationDate": "2008-03-16T00:15:08Z", "tags": ["Film", "Drama", "World cinema", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Flight of the Red Balloon, the revered Hou Hsiao-Hsien&apos;s second film outside Taiwan, is a slightly pointless homage to Albert Lamorisse&apos;s enchanting 1956 children&apos;s fantasy.", "Combining technical contrivance with improvisation, the film stars Juliette Binoche as a harassed French puppeteer who hires a Taiwanese student film-maker as nanny for her cute little son, Simon."], "title": "Review: Flight of the Red Balloon", "article": "Flight of the Red Balloon (113 mins, PG) Directed by Hou Hsiao-Hsien; starring Juliette Binoche, Fang Song, Simon Iteanu The prestige pictures of the week by arthouse directors are fitfully entertaining and somewhat whimsical.

I&apos;d always had this fascination with what domestic helpers in Taiwan wear, and I was interested in finding something utilitarian that I could wear every day to work. I liked the idea of wearing something extreme, so I asked the shop to make some trousers to match. At first they weren&apos;t so keen on custom-making me something, even though that is a really strong tradition in Asia. Eventually I convinced them and these worked out really well. How much did it cost? The suit cost the equivalent of \u00a360. Does wearing a uniform help you work? I&apos;m not sure - I don&apos;t remember I am wearing it any more. Occasionally people look at me on the street and I realise that, actually, it is quite bright, but I have forgotten that it is because I wear it all the time. It&apos;s easy to wash, too - my sleeves get quite dirty on the desk. Don&apos;t architects normally wear black?  Or is that a myth? Yes, I should be wearing black. It is a real cliche, but I have seen architects in all-red too. I think it&apos;s about being extreme, or wanting to make a mark on things. Where is your coat from? It&apos;s by Neil Barrett. I bought it in Japan: my brother lives there and I go there regularly. On what occasion do you think you  looked your best? When I got married I wore a silver Issey Miyake cape. It has a slit at the top that you are meant to put your head through, but I put the hole around my head because I didn&apos;t have a headpiece. I looked like a nun. Are you wearing your shoes for  practical reasons? Definitely, they are Birkenstocks and very comfortable. I wear them to meetings and also for walking in the hills. Have you always had your hair short? Yes, since I was 19; I&apos;m 42 now. When I was a teenager growing up in Seattle I had long curls all down my back with big glasses. I was very nerdy and I suppose I wanted to get away from that. It felt really good when I cut it. I felt like a different person who could do what I wanted to and be who I wanted to be. Do you spend much time and  energy shopping? I really don&apos;t like shopping. Once a year I go to Taiwan and get them to make me a few more uniforms. But I love looking - my husband hates watching me shop without buying anything. For me it&apos;s like going to a museum and seeing different facets of culture. Do you always wear makeup? I usually wear only lipstick. I feel more alive and vibrant with a bit of colour. When I&apos;m tired I have this greyish look and if I&apos;m trying to socialise I feel that lipstick alone picks up the features. Do you have any style icons? I don&apos;t really look at fashion magazines so I&apos;m not conscious of what stars are wearing, but I like the way Bj\u00f6rk uses her clothes to explore ideas. In a way it&apos;s similar to what David Bowie did, exploring different aspects of yourself through what you wear. It&apos;s almost the total opposite to this idea of having a uniform. Have you ever worn something you  have regretted? When I was younger I was not very fashion conscious. When I look at people who are dressing in an awkward way I really like it because I think if you are too tasteful, you are not being adventurous and it&apos;s actually a bit boring. It&apos;s the opposite of what architects do - I really like things that are a bit awkward being put together.

Its sense of betrayal is as striking as its inability to comprehend the cause of it. But Beijing&apos;s shame is widely shared. The unrest has confronted western governments with inconvenient truths to which they plainly have no answers. In the short term, the 2008 Olympics hosts know they must act cautiously as the world watches, its running shoes in hand. Having been forced belatedly to acknowledge the scale of the trouble, Beijing cannot afford an even wider, more brutal public crackdown, its instinctive reaction to similar situations in the past. State retaliation in the weeks and months ahead is likely to be stealthy and silent. For those who dared make a stand, vengeance will come by night, in an unmarked car or an unheralded knock on the door. This is typically how China deals with dissent, as Hu Jia, a prominent human rights activist who went on trail for subversion today could testify. Yet in blaming the Dalai Lama and his &quot;clique&quot; for organising a conspiracy of sabotage, China&apos;s premier, Wen Jiaboa, missed the mark. Tibet&apos;s exiled spiritual leader has long promoted an autonomous accommodation with, not independence from, China. It is younger generations of Tibetans, inside and outside the country, who increasingly call the shots and pursue more robust tactics. An editorial in the Communist party mouthpiece, the Tibet Daily, appeared to acknowledge this shift - while revealing the true extent of Chinese fury. &quot;These lawless elements have insulted, beaten, and wounded duty personnel, shouted reactionary slogans, stormed vital departments, and gone to all lengths in beating, smashing, looting, and burning,&quot; it said. &quot;Their atrocities are appalling and too horrible to look at and their frenzy is inhuman. Their atrocities of various kinds teach and alert us to the fact that this is a life-and-death struggle between the enemy and ourselves.&quot; This official &quot;us versus them&quot; view implies there will be no quick end to the disturbances or the retaliation. Horrific photographs released today by the Free Tibet campaign of 13 people allegedly killed at Kirtii monastery in Aba (Ngawa) town, Sichuan province, by Chinese security forces will meanwhile stoke opposition fires. The next flashpoint could be Beijing&apos;s plan to relay the Olympic torch through Lhasa and other ethnic Tibetan areas, on its journey from Greece to Beijing. Another so-called Chinese &quot;renegade province&quot;, Taiwan, has already refused to take part; Tibet was not given a choice. The broader prospect now, unnerving for a Chinese leadership that has staked so much on a showpiece, self-validating games, is of trouble continuing right through until August. This is a worrying prospect for western leaders, too. Gordon Brown must decide soon whether he will meet the Dalai Lama when he visits Britain in May. If he does so, it will enrage Beijing, even more than the German Chancellor Angela Merkel&apos;s recent meeting with the Tibetan leader. All Brown&apos;s commercial and business networking during his China trip earlier this year could be undone. The foreign secretary, David Miliband, tied himself up in knots when asked about a possible meeting, refusing to say whether the government would welcome it while insisting that the issue would be dealt with &quot;in a very straightforward and appropriate way&quot;. It&apos;s a safe bet that London hopes the Dali Lama won&apos;t come after all. Brown&apos;s decision to attend the Olympics opening ceremony, not normally an essential requirement despite the expected presence of George Bush, is also beginning to look like a big potential embarrassment. Steven Spielberg and Mia Farrow, attacking China over Darfur, triggered the first round of pre-Olympic, anti-Beijing media frenzy. Tibet is round two. There are more bouts, and many more similar issues, in the pipeline, waiting to trip up an accident-prone prime minister. Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering, president of the European parliament, yesterday urged politicians to reconsider going to Beijing if violence and repression in Tibet continued. Such calls are likely to become more voluble. Nearly all western governments have found themselves in the same leaky boat this week, calling meekly for more information, restraint and dialogue in Tibet and knowing their advice will be ignored. All insist a boycott of the games is not contemplated. All worry too much about the Chinese government&apos;s economic power and not enough about its basic political illegitimacy. All now face a growing body of international and domestic public opinion that is increasingly questioning what has been dubbed their pre-Olympics &quot;three monkeys policy&quot;. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil may have worked in 1904, when a power-grabbing British expeditionary force butchered thousands of Tibetans without a second thought. But in the present-day interconnected, globalised world that Brown and Miliband talk about and China perforce inhabits, that dog won&apos;t hunt."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2008/mar/19/a50handpoweredlaptopamazin", "publicationDate": "2008-03-19T17:15:44Z", "tags": ["Design", "Art and design", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Mass production of the hand-cranked computer began in Taiwan in November last year."], "title": "A \u00a350 hand-powered laptop? Amazing", "article": "Global winner ... Behar&apos;s XO-1 laptop Just when I thought I couldn&apos;t bear hearing about yet another design prize, I saw the winner of the London Design Museum&apos;s new Brit Insurance Design Award, for the best new design in any field worldwide. It is a delightful and very clever hand-cranked, $100 (\u00a350) laptop designed by Yves Behar, frontman of the San Francisco-based design studio fuseproject. The XO-1 laptop has been developed with the One Laptop per Child organisation which aims to distribute these, with financial backing from a number of business sources, to children in developing countries. The idea, though, is so special, and the design so alluring, that I can easily imagine demand for such a computer among the design and gizmo-conscious in any country, rich or poor. And this is surely a good thing. So often, designs aimed at those in poor parts of the world are a little cheap or simplistic and, whatever the intent, slightly patronising. Not so the XO-1. But, then, Behar is very much a product designer of our times, aware of how the latest design - even the most stylish is cleverly costed - can aid those for whom the latest wafer-thin Apple laptop, although beautiful, represents several years&apos; earnings. Born in Switzerland in 1967 to an East German mother and Jewish-Turkish father, Behar set up fuseproject in 1999; his blue-chip clients have included Birkenstock, Herman Miller, Hewlett Packard and Nike. Mass production of the hand-cranked computer began in Taiwan in November last year. The manufacturer, Quanta Computer, has said that it expects to ship between 5 and 10m XO-1s in 2008 to the governments of the eleven countries who apparently agreed to buy them. For the record, these are Argentina, Brazil, Ethiopia, Libya, Mexico, Mongolia, Nigeria, Peru, Rwanda, Thailand and Uruguay. A version of the X0-1 is also planned for the mass market. Dustproof, rustproof, weatherproof - as far as technically possible - the powerful Wi-Fi laptops can, theoretically, be used pretty much anywhere. Hand-cranked radios and torches have been around for some while now, but a computer that doesn&apos;t need to be plugged in for a recharge is really quite special. The AO-1, like the Tata Nano - the \u00a31,000 Indian mini-car from the most likely future owners of Jaguar - might just set a trend for chic, low-cost design that will make the manufacturers of high-priced glamour goods watch their corporate backs as well as their costs. But, if someone could make a hand-cranked laptop that looked like and sounded like a good, old-fashioned reporter&apos;s typewriter, I&apos;d be first in the queue.

IRAQ, FIVE YEARS ON The FT&apos;s editorial is damning on the situation in Iraq. &quot;These five years have provided the most public demonstration of the limits to American power - watched live on satellite television throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds like a modern version of the Crusades. Having casually overturned the Sunni Arab order in Iraq and empowered the Shia in an Arab heartland country for the first time in a millennium, highly enlarging the power of the Shia Islamist regime in Iran, the US now finds itself dependent on Tehran-aligned forces in Baghdad.&quot; Seumus Milne in the Guardian focuses on exposing the folly of the argument that the Iraq catastrophe was down to mistakes or lack of planning. He worries that by indulging the argument that Iraq was the right idea, wrongly executed, more trouble lies ahead. &quot;The disaster of Iraq has at least had the effect of demonstrating the limits of imperial power and restraining the US from further attacks. The danger is however that next time they&apos;ll try and do it differently - without the mistakes.&quot; Next to him, the former head of UN weapons inspections, Hans Blix, writes: &quot;I can only see one gain: the end of Saddam Hussein, a murderous tyrant. Had the war not finished him he would in all likelihood have become another Gadafy or Castro.&quot; Over the page, the editorial includes advice for the next US president, who &quot;has to set a date for withdrawal. The moment that happens, all parties in Iraq will look to their own power base in Iraq, not to US firepower.&quot; That also means America preparing for departure. &quot;America has to internationalise the solution to the conflict, not only by replacing its troops with troops from neutral countries, but by involving all Iraq&apos;s neighbours. Only when the sponsors of violence are involved will the groups they fund and arm begin to negotiate.&quot; The Sun lives up to its name with an optimistic editorial: &quot;In a northern region once devastated by Saddam&apos;s murderous chemical weapons, children play on swings and grow up happy and free. Even in Baghdad, the US troop surge has cut the bombing and killing. Security is improving and elections are back on the agenda.

Within hours, China made it known it was displeased with Brown&apos;s decision to fete a man the leader of the Tibetan Communist party described as a &quot;wolf in monk&apos;s clothing&quot;. Seumas Milne, in the same piece quoted above, brings the memory of Iraq into the wrangle over Tibet. &quot;How can anyone take seriously, for example, US or British leaders lecturing China about Tibet, Russia about Chechnya, or Sudan about Darfur, when they have triggered and presided over such an orgy of killing, collective punishment, prisoner abuse and ethnic cleansing?&quot; In its editorial, the Telegraph is slightly more impressed with western diplomatic endeavours, and harder on China, saying the two conditions that Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, has given for entering into dialogue with the Dalai Lama - renouncing violence and giving up the idea of independence for Tibet - have already been met. When will Wen Jiabao quit haranguing Brown and meet the Dalai Lama himself? &quot;The [Chinese Communist] party is shooting itself in the foot by demonising a man who is the living embodiment of peace. Agreeing to negotiate on the genuine autonomy that the Dalai Lama seeks would not necessarily win over all Tibetans; the exiled youth congress, for example, wants independence and accepts violence as a means to that end. &quot;But given the Dalai Lama&apos;s spiritual authority over his followers in China, it would take the sting out of the revolt. Instead the party has chosen to defame him with a grotesque caricature. Beijing&apos;s brutality has been noted in Taiwan where the frontrunner in Saturday&apos;s presidential elections who supports eventual reunification with China has been forced on the back foot.&quot; In the Guardian, Michael White says EU states and the US do not want and can not afford a &quot;diplomatic showdown&quot; given the current state of western financial disorder and China&apos;s huge foreign currency reserves, as well as its growing economic and diplomatic clout. &quot;The harsh fact of life for western states that interfered in China for the best part of two centuries is that Napoleon&apos;s fear, &apos;when China wakes the world will tremble&apos;, is at hand.&quot; Further back in the book, Timothy Garton Ash evaluates the options open to western leaders who want to help Tibet but are wary of the Chinese. He dismisses the kind of sanctions imposed on Burma; and rules out a suggestion by the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, that European leaders boycott the Olympics. He thinks it might be worth calling for UN observers to be allowed into Burma, but judges China would resist. He concludes that meeting the exiled leader is something every European leader should commit to. There is an amusing write-up of Mark Malloch Brown&apos;s intervention. Yesterday he seemed to encourage British athletes attending the Beijing Olympics to condemn China on human rights. &quot;Foreign Office toff&quot; is how the paper describes him. * Telegraph: China loses friends over Tibet* Guardian: Kowtowing to the Chinese* Guardian: Free countries must defy China CAMERON LEADS POLLS - BUT WHY? The opinion polls have been very bad for Labour over the last week, and a couple of commentators look at why. As Peter Riddell in the Times puts it: &quot;Could we be at the start of a potentially divisive shift in the polls against Labour, similar to the 1992-1993 swing against the Tories?&quot; Riddell doesn&apos;t think the rise in Tory support is the key change - the Tories have already been above 40 on nine previous occasions this year, he says, and quotes a respected academic as saying every postwar opposition that went on to win the next election went up as high as 50. Cameron has not yet done that. What Riddell thinks more significant is the fall for Labour below 30, driven he thinks by the public&apos;s certainty that in the future, taxes will rise. Is this fair to the government? &quot;For most British voters - except those in the financial services - an economic downturn is still a threat on the horizon, not a current fact. Unemployment has fallen again and the travel industry reports no fall-off in bookings yet. Of course, fuel bills have risen sharply and new housing activity is down, but there has been no wave of repossessions so far. The increased pessimism is more a response to bad headlines about financial turbulence and fears of what may come.&quot; And what about the man who is up in the polls? Cameron is now enjoying the kid of lead the Tories last had under Thatcher, and Iain Martin in the Telegraph is pleased. But why is Cameron in front? The polls followed a budget &quot;devoid of any feel good factor&quot; that &quot;seems to have produced cracks in the core Labour vote, rebuilt since Blair to a solid floor of 31-34 points&quot;. They are now at 27-29 points, and Martin argues that it&apos;s all shaping up rather nicely for DC. There is a &quot;but&quot;. &quot;The [Conservative] party does not have a coherent message on the economy for the millions of voters they need to win over. At PMQs yesterday, Cameron chose to ignore the financial crisis and, in the process, gave Brown a chance to bring up the omission as evidence that Cameron does not want to talk about serious matters.&quot; Rightwing papers the Daily Mail and Telegraph both run pieces on the cost of living that might go some way to explaining the polls. The Mail features a report by pay analysts IRS showing pay rises are below inflation - a typical rise for private sector workers being 3.5% when inflation is 4.1%. The reporter is using the retail price index, which includes costs such as mortgages and taxes, rather than the government&apos;s preferred consumer price index, which is lower. Using RPI figures, she says, &quot;[recently] fuel costs have risen up to 27%. The costs of many basic items are rising at their fastest pace since records began.&quot; The reporter says the Office of National Statistics regards these rises as the biggest since records began in 1997. * Times: Could budget gloom be Labour&apos;s point of no return?* Telegraph: Credit where it&apos;s due to David Cameron* Mail: Millions are facing the squeeze CONCESSION ON POST OFFICES With the local elections coming up in May, the bad polls for Labour may be why last night a concession on the closure of post offices was offered. The Commons saw a debate that allowed many Labour backbenchers to speechify about the threat to the post offices in their area, which in turn allowed them to be quoted in local papers as trying to save their post offices. The hope is it will go some way to protecting local councillors standing on a Labour ticket at the forthcoming elections. In the end, the eventual rebellion by Labour MPs was big - the biggest of Brown&apos;s premiership - but not big enough, and the vote was passed. Nick Watt in the Guardian lays out the &quot;rescue plan&quot; put forward by the government last night: apparently it called on post offices to give &quot;serious consideration&quot; to a scheme by Essex county council, which has taken over some branches earmarked for closure. Apparently this is something local councils have been pressing the government to let them do for 18 months. Up to 50 councils have said they would like to help. Watt writes: &quot;The government&apos;s move was greeted warily by the Tories who suspected that it was designed to reduce the size of a Labour backbench rebellion in yesterday&apos;s debate.&quot; Watt reports an amusing story told by Alan Duncan: &quot;We have reached the absurd situation where someone phoned up the post office and said: &apos;Excuse me, why is my village post office closing?&apos; to which the answer was, &apos;Because the postmaster wants to retire.&apos; &apos;That is not true,&apos; said the caller, &apos;I know it. I am the postmaster.&apos;&quot; The Telegraph - which has campaigned on the closure of post offices as an example of the decline and fall of Britannia - does not run any details of the government&apos;s concession. Instead, Andrew Gimson sketches Brown&apos;s Stalinist qualities as being in pure form on this question. &quot;Though set in motion before he became prime minister, one can well imagine that as chancellor of the exchequer he decided this mass cull was the only way forward. And the manner of the closures is thoroughly totalitarian with the pretence of consultation doing nothing to hide the brutal determination to get rid of 2,500 branches.&quot; * Guardian: Ministers back post office rescue plan* Telegraph: Gordon brown tramples on postal votes PAXMAN&apos;S PANTS So he does get things wrong after all. Jeremy Paxman came out recently saying he thought M&amp;S boxer shorts no longer gave a man the best support he could get. And he said he wasn&apos;t alone. From conversations with friends and colleagues, he said, and maybe even the cabinet ministers he mauls live on Newsnight each evening, he had uncovered &quot;widespread gusset anxiety&quot;. Now, Which? magazine has surveyed the lot and concluded that M&amp;S trunks trounce all other boxer shorts, including the four times more expensive Calvin Kleins. The Times sent a reporter to a central London department store to road-test various pants, not before checking with the Times&apos;s lawyer whether it was illegal to strut around a public space in knickers. The reporter met resistance in the floor manager at Marble Arch M&amp;S, &quot;whose unreasonable insistence that customers trying on underwear remain within the confines of their changing room area cut short a vital test as to the true quality of M&amp;S pants&quot;. Even though the shop assistant was the most prudish, the reporter says that after spending the entire day &quot;prancing around in nothing but pants&quot;, Which? is right and M&amp;S does indeed win. The Mail says: &quot;You&apos;re wrong about your pants Paxo... Jeremy Paxman may be sitting a little uncomfortably this morning. Or perhaps more comfortably than ever.&quot; The Mirror concentrates on the great Calvin Klein swindle. &quot;\u00a320 posh briefs worse than the \u00a35 M&amp;S ones that Paxo savaged&quot;. &quot;The Calvin Klein briefs were the worst for shrinking and fading - which must be a pain for those posers who love to show off the waistband.&quot; * Times: George follows Jeremy Paxman as Asda faces a stiff challenge* Mail: News in briefs* Mirror: Calvin&apos;s pants TODAY ON GUARDIAN UNLIMITED &gt;&gt; Australia deports British paedophile to UK &gt;&gt; Republican candidate John McCain visits Brown and Cameron &gt;&gt; Continued coverage of the Tibetan protests against Chinese rule"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/22/tibet.china", "publicationDate": "2008-03-22T00:00:26Z", "tags": ["Tibet", "China", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s ruling party is exploiting the unrest in Tibet in a last-gasp ploy to win today&apos;s presidential election, but the winner is tipped to be an opposition candidate who favours closer links with Beijing.", "Although the death toll from the Tibetan unrest remains unclear, reports of paramilitary police killing monks and protesters have heightened concerns in Taiwan about the consequences of forming closer relations with the mainland&apos;s authoritarian government.", "That plays badly for Ma&apos;s KMT, which is largely supported by the families of those who fled to Taiwan from the mainland after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, and is now on friendly terms with Beijing.", "By contrast, the DPP appeals mostly to indigenous Taiwanese with a more independent identity.", "After two four-year terms, Chen cannot run again, but he departs in characteristically feisty fashion with a referendum on whether the island should apply for UN membership under the name Taiwan.", "His main strategy has been to tar his opponent with an authoritarian brush, linking the former nationalist dictatorship of Taiwan with the current Communist dictatorship on the mainland.", "&quot;This is a choice between a democratic Taiwan and Communist China,&quot; DPP newspaper adverts declared yesterday."], "title": "Tibet high on agenda as Taiwan goes to polls", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s ruling party is exploiting the unrest in Tibet in a last-gasp ploy to win today&apos;s presidential election, but the winner is tipped to be an opposition candidate who favours closer links with Beijing. Trailing in the polls, the Democratic Progressive party candidate, Frank Hsieh, has warned that a vote for Ma Ying-jeou of the Kuomintang (nationalist) party could turn the island into a &quot;second Tibet&quot;. At a campaign rally this week activists from his party unfurled a giant Tibetan flag and sang a Tibetan anthem as supporters staged a candlelit vigil for Tibetans killed, injured or arrested by Chinese security forces. The tactics appear to be working, but they look likely to prove too little too late. Unpublished voter surveys show Ma&apos;s lead has shrunk from 20 percentage points in January to as few as five percentage points this week. Although the death toll from the Tibetan unrest remains unclear, reports of paramilitary police killing monks and protesters have heightened concerns in Taiwan about the consequences of forming closer relations with the mainland&apos;s authoritarian government. That plays badly for Ma&apos;s KMT, which is largely supported by the families of those who fled to Taiwan from the mainland after the Communists won the civil war in 1949, and is now on friendly terms with Beijing. Ma wants to pursue closer economic ties with China, regular scheduled flights across the strait, and - eventually - a peace treaty that would end more than half a century of hostility. By contrast, the DPP appeals mostly to indigenous Taiwanese with a more independent identity. The former DPP leader and outgoing president, Chen Shui-bian, is detested by the mainland&apos;s Communist government which accuses him of pursuing a separatist agenda. After two four-year terms, Chen cannot run again, but he departs in characteristically feisty fashion with a referendum on whether the island should apply for UN membership under the name Taiwan. Beijing considers this a threat to its sovereignty. Hsieh is expected to take a less confrontational stance if he wins. His main strategy has been to tar his opponent with an authoritarian brush, linking the former nationalist dictatorship of Taiwan with the current Communist dictatorship on the mainland. &quot;This is a choice between a democratic Taiwan and Communist China,&quot; DPP newspaper adverts declared yesterday. Ma has responded by trying to distance himself from Beijing. The KMT also arranged events in support of Tibet this week, with Ma suggesting a boycott of the Olympics if the Chinese crackdown becomes more violent.

It asks for help with the \u00a3385 she needs for her place at the St Paul&apos;s Nursing Training School in Kampala. But unlike most charitable appeals, the envelope used my studio address (I&apos;m an artist) which I do not generally use. This led me to wonder how someone at a nursing school in Uganda found my details. Is there any way of telling whether it is genuine or yet another scam?GO, London  Unless they have hearts of stone, no one receiving this letter could fail to be moved. It details how Florence was orphaned when rebel troops headed for her village. She writes: &quot;My mother was raped by 13 rebels while she was pregnant. My father&apos;s head was cut off as he was trying to defend my mother. I was raped by their commander.&quot;  There then follows graphic details of the attacks on her and her mother which are not suitable for inclusion in a family newspaper. She says was adopted by an 82-year-old widow who paid school fees but cannot help any longer as she is sick. The letter is accompanied by an itemised bill for tuition at the nursing school.  It is heart-wrenching material, especially given the state of many parts of Africa. But there are two problems to explore before sending any money.  The nursing training school uses a post box and does not have a phone - only a fax. An internet search produces no trace of the school.  And, more importantly, this very same handwritten letter from Florence has been doing the rounds for some time - only the date changes.  Guardian columnist Max Hastings referred to it in a Daily Mail article in February 2007 when he suspected it was phoney. And an MP in Victoria, Australia, who received a copy, denounced it as a fraud.  It is criminal your charitable instincts should be abused in this way. &apos;\u00a31m&apos; investment gets a zero rating My son, who lives in South Africa, was phoned by Scott Fitzgerald Group, a broker in the Far East. It offered an oil share which, it claimed, would double due to a future deal with China. He persuaded me to join. I sent \u00a3100,000 to a bank in Singapore and a further \u00a325,000 to a Hong Kong account. He paid an additional \u00a3900,000, making more than \u00a31m. None of this money has been invested and we cannot access it. What can you tell me about Scott Fitzgerald? VC, London  Scott Fitzgerald, no connection with the author of The Great Gatsby, has a business model selling shares which are either over-priced or worthless. It is difficult to know which, as you and your son are not even too sure about which stock you bought. Scott Fitzgerald&apos;s address is a small room in a Taiwan office block. But the real organisation is elsewhere - just where, is difficult to say, as the firm uses voice-over-internet-protocol phones which disguise geography.  It is connected to Clinton Parker, a British Virgin Islands company, subject of a warning by the Alabama Securities Commission. Clinton Parker convinces legitimate stockholders to sign over existing shares and invest additional cash to buy shares of so-called &quot;blue-chip&quot; stocks which are worthless.  Scott Fitzgerald uses several bank accounts throughout the Far East. While there have been a few recent successes in the fightback against boiler rooms, don&apos;t hold your breath.  There is no easy answer to this other than to ignore all investment offered by cold callers.  Turned down for cover after breast cancer test Early last year, I detected a breast lump. This worried me, so I went to the doctor who conducted tests over a number of months. Finally, I was told I did not have cancer, or any other disease, and that I was healthy.  Then I applied for critical illness cover with Norwich Union. But the insurance firm rejected me because I had taken breast cancer tests.  I questioned this, and it was referred to a higher level which confirmed that, as breast cancer could not be excluded from cover, the very act of taking a test meant I could not have a policy. Please help. JB, Buckinghamshire  You argued that if you had ignored the lump, you would not have visited the doctor and no one would have been any the wiser when you filled in your proposal form. But, as you went to the doctor, you were penalised although you passed the barrage of tests. Capital Letters told NU your broker had found cover at a similar price with Axa and Zurich using the same details and admitting you had been turned away by NU. However, despite your refusal, NU now says the turn-down was a &quot;mistake&quot; due to &quot;overly cautious underwriting&quot;. Whether you insure with NU, or elsewhere, it will write to apologise and send you a gift to say &quot;sorry&quot;.  There&apos;s no such thing as this free dinner I booked a three-day break over New Year at Disneyland Paris, with Mott Leisure, a tour company in Aylesbury. It changed our initial booking and sent a contract saying we would have dinner on New Year&apos;s Eve in the deal. But there was no dinner. Now Mott refuses to refund our money.  I consider we have been misled. KF, Hertfordshire  You originally paid \u00a3165 per head for bed and breakfast at a two-star hotel around 20 minutes drive from the resort. Mott found it had booked better rooms at a four-star hotel much nearer to Disney and upgraded you for nothing to a \u00a3239 holiday.  But when it sent the details for the new hotel, these mistakenly included mention of a dinner which applied to another deal. One adult member of your group was told on the phone that you would only receive bed and breakfast. While Mott should have been more careful with paperwork, what you had did not constitute a contract.  It is unreasonable on your part to expect both a better hotel room and a slap-up meal without paying more. Finally, land-bankers are grounded The Insolvency Service has this week shut down Sinclair Deville, a &quot;landbanker&quot; which sold &quot;investments&quot; to individuals who bought small plots in fields which, they were told, would soar in value once planning permission for housing was granted. Sinclair Deville took \u00a33.2m from 220 investors into what watchdog Financial Services Authority said was an &quot;unauthorised collective investment scheme&quot;. The Insolvency Service told the high court that Sinclair Deville had misled investors by claiming it only acquired land that satisfied &quot;stringent criteria&quot;. But there was no professional vetting before land was acquired. Guardian Money warned against the company in September 2005 and again in December 2006. Sinclair Deville told investors not to check land deals with local authorities as &quot;any perceived harassment could damage the sensitive process of promoting the site for planning&quot;.  Milton Keynes, the local council for the land in question, poured cold water on the potential for the site Sinclair Deville sold. The court was also told Sinclair Deville, run by director Paul Daniels, could not repay investors. Its website has still to be shut down. In a separate move, Baljinder Chohan, a director of land-banker UKLI, has been banned from being a director for four years for his promotion of UK Property Fund Managers. This promised a \u00a31bn &quot;Shariah law compliant&quot; fund.  The court was told he inflated figures while a promised NHS deal was &quot;manifestly untrue and misleading&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/22/china", "publicationDate": "2008-03-22T17:14:45Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["More than a decade of tension between Taiwan and mainland China looked set to ease today with the victory of nationalist party candidate Ma Ying-jeou in the island&apos;s presidential election.", "They want peace across the Taiwan Strait.", "Ma has proposed a peace treaty that would demilitarise the Taiwan Strait, and said he would ease restrictions on mainland investments by Taiwanese businesses.", "In a brief report on the result, China&apos;s official Xinhua News Agency said Ma&apos;s had won the island&apos;s &quot;leadership election&quot; - reflecting Beijing&apos;s refusal to recognise Taiwan&apos;s government.", "It also noted the failure of two referenumsa on whether Taiwan should apply to join the United Nations.", "But its impact on Taiwan&apos;s still-young democracy is less sure."], "title": "Pro-China candidate wins Taiwan election", "article": "More than a decade of tension between Taiwan and mainland China looked set to ease today with the victory of nationalist party candidate Ma Ying-jeou in the island&apos;s presidential election.

In a brief report on the result, China&apos;s official Xinhua News Agency said Ma&apos;s had won the island&apos;s &quot;leadership election&quot; - reflecting Beijing&apos;s refusal to recognise Taiwan&apos;s government.  It also noted the failure of two referenumsa on whether Taiwan should apply to join the United Nations. The referendums - held in conjunction with the presidential vote - were described by China as a threat to peace. China, which has over 1,000 missiles aimed across the strait, says it will use force to prevent any move towards formal independence.  Recently Beijing has adopted a relatively soft tone in comparison to its earlier, more bellicose rhetoric. Instead, it has encouraged others to criticise Taipei on its behalf. The United States, Russia and Britain opposed the referendum on UN membership.  A Ma victory looks likely to usher in a more relaxed regional environment.

On Saturday, the voters of Taiwan ended the eight-year presidential rule of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and elected Ma Ying-jeou, of the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Party, as their new president. The outcome was, of course, important for its political and economic implications for the island, split from the mainland since Chiang Kai-shek led his KMT regime there after crashing to defeat in the Chinese civil war in 1949. Ma&apos;s victory brings the prospect of more cohesive administration after years in which the DPP president, Chen Shui-bian, was at loggerheads with the opposition-dominated legislature - followed by accusations of corruption against the supposedly squeaky-clean DPP and the Chen family. Ma is set on improving relations with Beijing after the frosty era under Chen, whom China always suspected of aiming for independence - though the strength of Taiwanese autonomist feeling is such that reunification is off the agenda. Ma will negotiate for increased links, but as a separate party not as a subservient province of the mainland. What underlies the election result, however, is an almost perfect example of how dictatorship can best be transformed into democracy. Whether you support the DPP or the KMT, Taiwan stands in glaring contrast to the lack of political progress on the mainland - not to mention Tibet. To recap some history. After being a Japanese colony since Tokyo inflicted a disastrous defeat on imperial China in 1894-5 and took the island as part of the spoils of war, Taiwan reverted to Chinese rule in 1945. Chiang built up a safe haven there which he badly needed when the People&apos;s Liberation Army swept across the mainland in 1948-9. The generalissimo then imposed the tight dictatorial rule he had failed to achieve in China, with the minority Chinese lording it over the natives and KMT soldiers massacring native Taiwanese when they protested - shades of Tibet. While the KMT maintained one-party rule, land reform and the development of manufacturing pushed the economy ahead. As part of the US strategic screen round China since the Korean War, Taiwan under the KMT could count on Washington&apos;s protection, even if American held Chiang back from schemes to attack the mainland during Mao&apos;s wilder moments. After Chiang&apos;s death in 1975, his son, Ching-kuo, relaxed some of his father&apos;s restrictions. Opposition parties were then allowed to take form. Ching-kuo&apos;s successor, Lee Teng-hui, won a faction fight in the KMT, besting Chiang&apos;s widow, among others, and as president began to talk of Taiwan having achieved the position of a &quot;state&quot;. Beijing was furious. With hundreds of missiles pointing across the 90-mile Taiwan Strait, it launched war games in 1996 which ended after Bill Clinton sent the fleet. All the time, the Taiwanese majority developed increasing opposition to Chinese-KMT rule, and, in the presidential election of 2000, the DPP&apos;s Chen rode to victory on the back of the appeal of &quot;Taiwanese identity&quot;, and a major split in the corrupt, out-dated KMT which enabled him to get in on a minority vote. Four years later, Chen was narrowly re-elected. Having moved from dictatorship to real democracy, Taiwan has now taken the second confirming step of democratisation. Democratic pressure has forced the KMT to re-invent itself as a party that sheds the Chiang Kai-shek shibboleths and says it will work for the good of Taiwan, not for some illusion of re-uniting China under the nationalists. In legislative elections earlier this year and now in the weekend presidential poll, the electorate showed that it was ready to switch back. This is a story of how democracy can come out of dictatorship. Not to replace the old authority with an equally dominant party, as in South Africa, but with a genuine system of alternatives. The army has stayed in its barracks. The old order has been displaced at the behest of the electorate. When the DPP was seen to have failed to live up its promise, its time had come. Whether Ma will be able to buck up the economy and how he will fare with Beijing remain open questions in the two months before he takes office. The DPP will go off to re-engineer itself, seeking to recover from the problems brought on it by Chen&apos;s headstrong approach and its repeated fumblings in domestic policy. But what is deeply sad in all this is that the net result of having given birth to the first true multi-party democracy in Greater China, Taiwan has found itself horribly isolated in the world. Beijing insists that there is only one China and that the island remains a province of the mainland - at the session of the Chinese legislature which has just ended, delegates sat for Taiwan who have nothing to do with the island - just as Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s parliament included representatives elected for long-lost mainland provinces. The rest of the world kow-tows. Despite its role in helping to fight regional outbreaks of disease, Taiwan is refused observer status at the World Health Organisation. Taiwanese representatives round the world operate under the guise of cultural or trade missions. When Chen raised the prospect of a referendum on changing the constitution of what still calls itself the &quot;Republic of China&quot;, Washington told him to back off for fear of infuriating Beijing, regardless of what the electorate might say. Fear of offending Beijing has become a leitmotif of western policy, but, in the case of Taiwan under Chen, there was a strong secondary element: a real fear that he might push the cause of formal independence, as against the present de facto independence, and thus provoke war across the strait. Ma&apos;s victory has removed that prospect, which would have been a disaster for both China and Taiwan. With strong presidential and legislative majorities, the new president is well placed to open a fresh era in Taiwan&apos;s evolution. He faces considerable problems, notably on the economic front if the export-driven economy is hit by the US slowdown. But the nervousness that Chen aroused in the west and Japan should be calmed while Beijing faces the challenge of dealing with a more reasonable, supple, strongly-based leader across the water. China may not have found its moment for political progress, but Taiwan has, and that should be recognised. Now that Taiwan&apos;s people have shown their double democratic maturity, it must be time for foreign governments to be less circumspect towards an island which has every reason to be proud of itself. Tibet may occupy the headlines, but Washington, London, Tokyo, Berlin and Paris should be telling Beijing - without, or course, raising hackles about interfering in China&apos;s internal affairs - that it is time to recognise the reality across the strait."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/25/goldmedalforrepression", "publicationDate": "2008-03-25T12:30:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Sport", "Human rights", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The luckier victims of China&apos;s oppressions are not those sent without trial to &quot;education through labour&quot; in the Laogai where death is slow, but those shot for any of the more than 60 capital offences on China&apos;s books (they include fraud, tax evasion, smuggling, bribery, &quot;splittism&quot; (ie, advocating independence for Tibet), Taiwan, or anywhere else) - providing, of course, they are also lucky enough not to have their corneas or kidneys removed for transplant purposes before being shot."], "title": "Gold medal for repression", "article": "China was desperate to get the 2000 Olympics, because it wanted the &quot;face&quot; that would thereby accrue, allowing it to walk tall on the international stage and show off its extraordinarily rapid development and re-invention as a modern, major world-influencing state. When Sydney was awarded the 2000 games instead there was crushing disappointment in Beijing. What then went into its renewed efforts to get the 2008 games is anyone&apos;s guess, given that China does not observe norms of law or morality in going after what it wants; but by the time of the Moscow meeting at which the 2008 games decision was made, Beijing was a very clear front-runner over Paris and Toronto in the minds of the IoC committee, whose then-shortly-to-retire chairman, Juan Antonio Samaranch, was as keen for China to win as any politburo member in the Forbidden City&apos;s Zhong Nan Hai complex. At the time, many of us engaged in campaigning about China&apos;s appalling human rights record lobbied hard against Beijing&apos;s candidature. One thing we understood was that success for Beijing, conjoined with China&apos;s effect on glazed-eyed salivating western businessmen and their governments seduced by the &quot;vast potential market&quot; promise (yet to be fulfilled), would almost completely stifle interest in protests about Chinese human rights violations - and so it has proved until now. Indeed, the fact that in China&apos;s poverty-stricken hinterlands, hidden behind the glittering economic success of the Special Economic Zones, there is frequent harshly-repressed turmoil and rioting, is barely mentioned in the western press, who do not have correspondents in the rural depths of Hunan and Gansu or the &quot;minority regions&quot;, and who ignore the samizdat news reports that filter out of them. It would take too long to list the many respects in which the human rights of Chinese citizens are persistently and comprehensively abused - but that in any case is common knowledge: any number of reports in the public domain from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty, the United Nations, the US government, and other agencies, rehearse the data in detail. I shall mention just one: that the &quot;Laogai&quot; - the vast gulag of more than 1,000 forced labour camps, which Harry Wu&apos;s Laogai Research Foundation calculates has had more than 40 million inmates since the first camps opened in the 1950s - continues its output of slave-made products, at least one example of which readers of these words will encounter in the course of any fortnight, whether packaging or plastic chopsticks or some other cheap artefact marked &quot;Made in China&quot;. Like all economic miracles in history, China&apos;s miracle also depends on slavery. The luckier victims of China&apos;s oppressions are not those sent without trial to &quot;education through labour&quot; in the Laogai where death is slow, but those shot for any of the more than 60 capital offences on China&apos;s books (they include fraud, tax evasion, smuggling, bribery, &quot;splittism&quot; (ie, advocating independence for Tibet), Taiwan, or anywhere else) - providing, of course, they are also lucky enough not to have their corneas or kidneys removed for transplant purposes before being shot. China executes more people annually than the whole of the rest of the world put together - and the families of the victims pay for the bullets. I have personally seen a truckload of those about to be executed in a public stadium being paraded through the streets of a Chinese city, tied up and with banners announcing their crimes pinned to them. The occupation and repression of Tibet is in the news again because, of course, Tibetan activists are using the run-up to the games as a means of getting the outside world&apos;s wavering, short-term, Attention Deficit Disorder notice back to their terrible plight. Western press coverage rather feebly mentions that there is unrest in the provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan and Xinjiang also: and yes, at the very least craniums are being cracked and kidneys kicked there too, and the trucks heading for the Laogai are even fuller than usual - and not just because of the typical and predictable re-run of the notorious Strike Hard campaigns to &quot;clean up&quot; Beijing and other major cities before the influx of foreign visitors, aimed at getting rid of dissidents or &quot;liu meng&quot; or just anyone whose jib is not cut as the party and the Gong An Ju (the &quot;public peace bureau&quot; as the police are known) like. The games ought not to have gone to a country which should, in all conscience, be a pariah for its atrocious human rights record; but now that the whole world will be looking on, the opportunity to protest against that record and force China to change is too significant to miss. It is also an opportunity to point to the fact that wherever there is a delinquent state - Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma - there is China, propping it up, giving it money and arms, getting its foot firmly in the door for its own future benefit, meanwhile keeping the international community distracted by all the bush fires thus kept burning. What a great member of the UN security council (China, like Russia, as a matter of policy usually votes the contrary way no matter what the issue) and World Trade Organisation (which is against slavery, patent and copyright violations, technology theft, and all the rest of China&apos;s tricks) China is.

More than 30 monks at Jokhang Temple - the most sacred in Tibetan Buddhism - burst in on a briefing during the first foreign journalists tour since riots erupted in the Tibetan capital on March 14. Interrupting a speech about inter-ethnic harmony by the head of the temple&apos;s administrative office, the lamas surrounded the journalists and said, &quot;They are tricking you. Don&apos;t believe them. They are lying to you.&quot; &quot;They want us to crush the Dalai Lama and that is not right,&quot; one monk told the Associated Press news agency, denying that Tibet&apos;s exiled spiritual leader was responsible for the unrest. The monks, who first spoke Tibetan and then switched to Mandarin so the reporters could understand them, said they were willing to risk arrest to speak out.  &quot;It was an astonishing act of defiance,&quot; said Callum MacLeod of USA Today. &quot;The monks hijacked the briefing. They were desperate to get their story out - that they have no freedom, that 120 of them haven&apos;t been allowed to leave their dormitories since March 14.&quot; Another reporter on the trip, Wang Che-nan, a cameraman for Taiwan&apos;s ETTV, told Reuters that the incident lasted about 15 minutes, after which unarmed police took the Tibetans to another area of the temple. China&apos;s state-run Xinhua news agency noted that the media tour had been briefly disrupted by monks. The incident will be an embarrassment to the government, which organised the trip to show that stability had returned to Lhasa and to emphasise the murderous behaviour of some Tibetan rioters. The reporters have one full day in the city, where they will meet officials and victims of the arson attacks, beatings and other ethnic hate crimes. According to the authorities, at least 22 people died in Lhasa, most of them Han and Hui Chinese who either burned to death in fires or were killed by members of the indigenous population.Overseas Tibetan groups say almost 140 people died, many of them shot by the security forces in Lhasa and other areas of unrest in Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan provinces. It is impossible to confirm or disprove either figure because of tight media restrictions on the affected areas. Chinese officials and many bloggers have criticised foreign media organisations for &quot;misrepresenting&quot; the riots as protests, for calling the police response a &quot;crackdown&quot;, for underplaying the ethnic violence, and for wrongly captioning pictures to cast the security forces in a bad light. Public anger has manifested itself in online denunciations, hate mail and death threats to some organisations. CNN briefly moved out of its office.

Ian Cheshire didn&apos;t lay it on too thickly, but then he didn&apos;t have to. The dividend was halved and the new strategy can be summarised in four words: we must do better. Gerry Murphy, who fell on his sword last November, didn&apos;t come out well. But is this a little unfair on Murphy? Is Kingfisher actually a business whose best years are over? It certainly looks as if the DIY boom, which fuelled B&amp;Q&apos;s growth during the 1980s and 1990s, may never be seen again. When the market leader in Britain is bumbling along with profit margins of just 3.5%, the problem may be the market itself. Three years ago B&amp;Q made \u00a3400m; last year it was just \u00a3153m. As for Kingfisher, profits have now fallen for four years in a row - that looks like a trend. If the governor of the Bank of England is right about house prices being flattish for a few years, the immediate outlook may be even worse. From B&amp;Q&apos;s point of view, the correlation between buying houses and buying paint and bathroom tiles is horribly close. Forget the idea that the punters, instead of moving home, will tart up their existing places: it has never worked that way. Cheshire&apos;s strategy is a series of self-help measures. Functions such as purchasing and IT will be moved to the centre, capital expenditure will be cut 25%, and there will be a concentration on generating cash. It all sounds sensible but, like the cut in the dividend, it sends an unmistakeable message that the hatches are being battened down. The long-term opportunities should lie in developing markets, such as Poland and China. In theory, they could be as exciting for B&amp;Q as the DIY market in Britain in the late 1980s. But the same might have been said about Korea and Taiwan, and B&amp;Q has got out of both. Now the Chinese operation has produced a \u00a333m write-off. Good news, like a B&amp;Q shop assistant, is hard to find. One-nil to the doves DeAnne Julius, a former member of the Bank of England&apos;s monetary policy committee, picked a good day on which to push the idea that interest rates should be cut by half a percentage point next month. Nationwide building society, by lifting its mortgage rates, illustrated how the freeze in wholesale lending markets is now being felt on the high street. Will the Bank pay any attention? Almost certainly not, say the money markets. They are only now beginning to price in the probability of a 0.25-point cut in April. The possibility of a half-point cut is not being contemplated by most economists. Yet, by the time the MPC meets the week after next, it is possible that the debate may have moved on. The headlines in today&apos;s paper look grim: a large pub company in administration, a dividend cut from Kingfisher, consumer confidence at a 15-year low. If the official economic data in the next fortnight follows the same course, there must be a chance. Of course, the arguments against a half-point cut are strong. It would look panicky; retail sales are up, and inflation is still rising. But it&apos;s an interesting outside bet - a bit like the odds on Barnsley beating Chelsea in the FA Cup.It&apos;s trim up North Forecasting an end to Northern Foods&apos; woes has been a mug&apos;s game over the years. A profits warning has usually arrived to quash spirits and remind the outside world that few things in business are as reliable as a supermarket&apos;s ability to squeeze its suppliers. But look at this: Northern has not warned on profits for two years and now it has gone one better - profits this year will beat market expectations, the company said yesterday. Something seems to be stirring in the land of Fox&apos;s biscuits and M&amp;S ready meals. The impressive part is that Northern - finally - is managing to pass on the rising cost of commodities. There seem to be two factors at work. First, the newish chief executive Stefan Barden has installed some hard-nosed sales people - that is the common sense part. Second, after years of belt-tightening, Northern seems to have reached the point where its factories are working at close to full capacity so it can afford to turn away unprofitable business - that sounds like a major structural shift. The sceptic says roaring commodity price inflation could play havoc with this recovery story. The optimist says the share price hasn&apos;t caught up with the reality that Northern is in better shape than it has been for years. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/30/olympicgames2008.china", "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T00:03:19Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "China", "Tibet", "Human rights", "Foreign policy", "Gordon Brown", "Politics", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["The West does not support an independent Taiwan, nor an independent Hong Kong, despite strong local movements agitating for independence."], "title": "Leader: Brown should not rule out a Beijing boycott", "article": "When China won the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games seven years ago, Liu Qi, president of the Beijing organising committee and the then Beijing city mayor, told the International Olympic Committee: &apos;If Beijing wins its bid to host the Olympic Games, it will be conducive to China&apos;s economic and social progress; at the same time, it will also make further progress on the promotion of human rights.&apos; Wang Wei secretary-general of the Beijing 2008 Olympic bid committee, backed him up: &apos;We will grant full freedom of the press to the journalists coming to China; they will be able to visit Beijing and other Chinese cities and cover any news event before and during the Olympic Games.

Environmental, trade union and human-rights activists suffer house arrest or imprisonment, only tried under the catch-all charge of &apos;subverting state power&apos;. This so-called crime saw human-rights campaigner Yang Chunlin condemned to five years&apos; imprisonment last week. China has seen little progress towards more freedom of expression; the country executes more people and arrests more journalists than the rest of the world combined. It routinely blocks foreign news to which the state objects and censors the internet. The conditions that existed in 2001 have not improved at all; in many ways, they have worsened. Events in Tibet have crystallised concerns. The West does not support an independent Taiwan, nor an independent Hong Kong, despite strong local movements agitating for independence. So there cannot be a different policy towards those who lobby for independence for Tibet, where China&apos;s historic claim to the territory is only marginally weaker and where a significant, if still a minority, of the population is Han Chinese. Even a democratic China that fully respected human rights would regard Tibet as an integral part of its territory, rather as Spain regards the Basque country, France Corsica and Britain Northern Ireland. However, that does not give China licence brutally to repress dissent in Tibet, to discriminate against its powerful religious traditions embodied in the Dalai Lama and comprehensively fail to deliver on promises of autonomy even within its own constitutional framework. Beijing might have regarded the protests led by monks earlier this months to mark the anniversary of a famous uprising 49 years ago as opportunistically embarrassing in the run-up to the Olympics - as they were - but that did not justify the extent of the aggressive response.  If China wants to be fully accepted as a major actor in the international community, then it has to behave as a responsible stakeholder in its actions. That especially includes its actions towards its territories like Tibet. This is not only important in terms of its internal affairs. It is also vital in the upholding of international law, multilateral institutions and a common framework of human rights to which the world adheres. The world needs China to take these issues seriously, whether in Tibet or Darfur, and to recognise that it will be held to account if it does not.  There is also a role for the Games&apos; corporate sponsors - Coca-Cola, Visa, McDonald&apos;s and Microsoft among them - to add to the pressure, speaking to the Chinese government privately, while also setting public criteria for their continued support. Those companies sponsoring the Olympic torch relay - due to reach London next weekend - have already shown their anxiety in the face of protests. Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have hinted that if China continues to behave poorly in Tibet and does not keep the promises it made in 2001, then they will consider not attending the state opening of the Games. Their national teams would still compete, so that the Olympics as a wonderful celebration of sport and athletic excellence would not be damaged. In response to the pressure so far, China has offered foreign diplomats a fact-finding day in Lhasa - a small breakthrough and inconceivable without the actions of its critics.  To achieve real influence, the EU should speak as one. Gordon Brown has made clear his absolute determination to attend the opening ceremony. In fact, like his European counterparts, he should insist China adheres to its pledges before committing himself. There is power in the use of such influence. Merkel and Sarkozy are correct. The presence of European leaders should not be guaranteed unless China keeps its promises."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/30/fossilfuels.water", "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T00:03:19Z", "tags": ["Fossil fuels", "Water", "Energy", "Oil", "Environment", "Business", "Oil"], "sentences": ["Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have clashed over underwater oil reserves in the South China Sea."], "title": "John Gray: Those who control oil and water will control the world", "article": "History may not repeat itself, but, as Mark Twain observed, it can sometimes rhyme. The crises and conflicts of the past recur, recognisably similar even when altered by new conditions. At present, a race for the world&apos;s resources is underway that resembles the Great Game that was played in the decades leading up to the First World War. Now, as then, the most coveted prize is oil and the risk is that as the contest heats up it will not always be peaceful. But this is no simple rerun of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, there are powerful new players and it is not only oil that is at stake.  It was Rudyard Kipling who brought the idea of the Great Game into the public mind in Kim, his cloak-and-dagger novel of espionage and imperial geopolitics in the time of the Raj. Then, the main players were Britain and Russia and the object of the game was control of central Asia&apos;s oil. Now, Britain hardly matters and India and China, which were subjugated countries during the last round of the game, have emerged as key players. The struggle is no longer focused mainly on central Asian oil. It stretches from the Persian Gulf to Africa, Latin America, even the polar caps, and it is also a struggle for water and depleting supplies of vital minerals. Above all, global warming is increasing the scarcity of natural resources. The Great Game that is afoot today is more intractable and more dangerous than the last. The biggest new player in the game is China and it is there that the emerging pattern is clearest. China&apos;s rulers have staked everything on economic growth. Without improving living standards, there would be large-scale unrest, which could pose a threat to their power. Moreover, China is in the middle of the largest and fastest move from the countryside to the city in history, a process that cannot be stopped.  There is no alternative to continuing growth, but it comes with deadly side-effects. Overused in industry and agriculture, and under threat from the retreat of the Himalayan glaciers, water is becoming a non-renewable resource. Two-thirds of China&apos;s cities face shortages, while deserts are eating up arable land. Breakneck industrialisation is worsening this environmental breakdown, as many more power plants are being built and run on high-polluting coal that accelerates global warming. There is a vicious circle at work here and not only in China. Because ongoing growth requires massive inputs of energy and minerals, Chinese companies are scouring the world for supplies. The result is unstoppable rising demand for resources that are unalterably finite.  Although oil reserves may not have peaked in any literal sense, the days when conventional oil was cheap have gone forever. Countries are reacting by trying to secure the remaining reserves, not least those that are being opened up by climate change. Canada is building bases to counter Russian claims on the melting Arctic icecap, parts of which are also claimed by Norway, Denmark and the US. Britain is staking out claims on areas around the South Pole.  The scramble for energy is shaping many of the conflicts we can expect in the present century. The danger is not just another oil shock that impacts on industrial production, but a threat of famine. Without a drip feed of petroleum to highly mechanised farms, many of the food shelves in the supermarkets would be empty. Far from the world weaning itself off oil, it is more addicted to the stuff than ever. It is hardly surprising that powerful states are gearing up to seize their share. This new round of the Great Game did not start yesterday. It began with the last big conflict of the 20th century, which was an oil war and nothing else. No one pretended the first Gulf War was fought to combat terrorism or spread democracy. As George Bush Snr and John Major admitted at the time, it was aimed at securing global oil supplies, pure and simple. Despite the denials of a less honest generation of politicians, there can be no doubt that controlling the country&apos;s oil was one of the objectives of the later invasion of Iraq.  Oil remains at the heart of the game and, if anything, it is even more important than before. With their complex logistics and heavy reliance on air power, high-tech armies are extremely energy-intensive. According to a Pentagon report, the amount of petroleum needed for each soldier each day increased four times between the Second World War and the Gulf War and quadrupled again when the US invaded Iraq. Recent estimates suggest the amount used per soldier has jumped again in the five years since the invasion.  Whereas Western countries dominated the last round of the Great Game, this time they rely on increasingly self-assertive producer countries. Mr Putin&apos;s well-honed contempt for world opinion might grate on European ears, but Europe is heavily dependent on his energy. Hugo Ch\u00e1vez might be an object of hate for George W Bush, but Venezuela still supplies around 10 per cent of America&apos;s imported oil. President Ahmadinejad is seen by some as the devil incarnate, but with oil at more than a $100 a barrel, any Western attempt to topple him would be horrendously risky.  While Western power declines, the rising powers are at odds with each other. China and India are rivals for oil and natural gas in central Asia. Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia have clashed over underwater oil reserves in the South China Sea. Saudi Arabia and Iran are rivals in the Gulf, while Iran and Turkey are eyeing Iraq. Greater international co-operation seems the obvious solution, but the reality is that as the resources crunch bites more deeply, the world is becoming steadily more fragmented and divided. We are a long way from the fantasy world of only a decade ago, when fashionable gurus were talking sagely of the knowledge economy. Then, we were told material resources did not matter any more - it was ideas that drove economic development. The business cycle had been left behind and an era of endless growth had arrived. Actually, the knowledge economy was an illusion created by cheap oil and cheap money and everlasting booms always end in tears. This is not the end of the world or of global capitalism, just history as usual.  What is different this time is climate change. Rising sea levels reduce food and fresh-water supplies, which may trigger large-scale movements of refugees from Africa and Asia into Europe. Global warming threatens energy supplies. As the fossil fuels of the past become more expensive, others, such as tar sands, are becoming more economically viable, but these alternative fuels are also dirtier than conventional oil.  In this round of the Great Game, energy shortage and global warming are reinforcing each another. The result can only be a growing risk of conflict. There were around 1.65 billion people in the world when the last round was played out. At the start of the 21st century, there are four times as many, struggling to secure their future in a world being changed out of recognition by climate change. It would be wise to plan for some more of history&apos;s rhymes. \u00b7 John Gray is author of Black Mass: Apocalyptic Religion and the Death of Utopia, published by Allen Lane in paperback on 24 April"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/30/useconomy.economics", "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T00:03:34Z", "tags": ["US economy", "Economics", "Business"], "sentences": ["As these sell in dollars, it makes sense for nations such as Taiwan to peg their currency to the greenback, or risk paying through the nose for military hardware with a potentially fragile currency."], "title": "Dollar chilled by rise of euro", "article": "Lurking behind the headline-grabbing stories about the credit crunch, the US housing crash and the near-death experiences of Northern Rock and Bear Stearns, is the bigger one about the slump in the value of the American dollar. So steeply has the greenback fallen in value against its main rivals - the euro and the Japanese yen - that economists are talking about the dollar losing its status as the world&apos;s reserve currency, a position it has held since 1945. Commentators have written the dollar&apos;s obituary on countless occasions over the past 40 years, principally in the late 1970s and early 1990s, when America&apos;s economic performance compared badly with that of Japan or Germany. So what is different about today? There are two answers: globalisation and the existence of a rival in the form of the euro, the currency of choice for an economic bloc that is as big as America&apos;s. Germany and Japan by themselves never stood a chance of usurping the dollar because their economies were small compared with that of the US. Today, the eurozone trading bloc is as big as America and set to grow larger as new member states join the EU. Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University believes the euro &apos;could surpass the dollar in 10 years&apos;. He says that the reasons for America&apos;s longer-term economic decline are well rehearsed, but the most persistent one is its yawning current account deficit, which is plugged by borrowing from creditor nations - particularly China and the oil-rich nations of the Arabian Gulf. If the dollar continues to lose ground, and it has fallen by 52 per cent against a trade-weighted basket of currencies since 1985, other countries may not find it worthwhile to invest in dollar-denominated assets (which helps to offset the US current account shortfall) whether they be equities, American government bonds, mortgage-backed securities or even highly rated US corporate debt. Frankel says: &apos;The US would lose the &quot;exorbitant privilege&quot; of being able to finance its international deficits easily.&apos; But there are also geopolitical implications, which Frankel outlines with brutal clarity. He says: &apos;In the past, US deficits have been manageable because allies have been willing to pay a financial price to support American global leadership.&apos; In the 1960s, for instance, Germany offset the expense of stationing US troops on its territory to save America from a massive balance of payments shortfall. In 1991, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Japan were willing to pay the financial cost of the war against Iraq, briefly wiping out the US current account deficit. But can America depend on its allies in the future? People like Frankel at Harvard and Professor Menzie Chin at the University of Wisconsin are doubtful. In a recent paper, the pair draw a parallel with the decline in the status of the pound during the first half of the 20th century. It was part of a larger pattern whereby Britain lost its economic pre-eminence, colonies, military power and other trappings of international hegemony. &apos;Some wonder whether the US might now have embarked on a path of &quot;imperial overreach&quot;, following the British Empire down a road of widening budget deficits and overly ambitious military adventures in the Muslim world.&apos; The Suez crisis of 1956 is frequently recalled as the occasion on which Britain was forced under US pressure to abandon residual imperial designs. But the importance of a run on the pound, along with President Eisenhower&apos;s decision not to offer IMF support unless Britain withdrew its troops from Egypt, should also be remembered. The US, however, isn&apos;t where Britain was at the time of Suez. Indeed, many analysts expect the dollar to recover some of its lost ground by the end of the year. Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics says: &apos;We don&apos;t see a dollar rout from here. Much of the bad news about the credit squeeze and the woes of the banking sector are already factored into the price of the US currency.&apos; Nevertheless, Stephen King, HSBC&apos;s chief global economist, is prepared to entertain the notion that the dollar could lose its status as pre-eminent reserve currency, although he is sceptical that the euro will simply supplant it. He says if the US goes into recession, it&apos;s only a matter of time before euroland is dragged down, along with the rest of the world. King says: &apos;It is hard to write off the dollar. Sure, the dollar will bump along the bottom for a while. When you have a banking crisis like this one, it could take a lot to fix it. It may be two or three years of a long, hard slog. But why would central banks suddenly dump the dollar? That would cut the value of their own substantive dollar assets. Don&apos;t forget, the Chinese have $1.5 trillion of foreign reserves.&apos; Still, King accepts that central banks could diversify slowly out of dollars, opting instead for a variety of alternatives, not just the euro. At some point in the distant future, the Chinese yuan could be part of a more balanced central bank portfolio, as well as currencies from other emerging nations. Legendary US investor Warren Buffett has already taken the plunge. Last year, the only foreign-currency deal of Buffett&apos;s Berkshire Hathaway vehicle was to buy the Brazilian real, which has doubled in value compared with the US dollar in five years.  King says America&apos;s reliance on others to fund its deficits has accelerated the rise of new powers that will one day challenge its hegemony. According to this thesis, the US becomes, in part, the victim of globalisation, rather than its champion. King gives the example of 16th-century Spain, which became a regional superpower as the biggest producer of silver and gold thanks to its colonisation of South America. But Spain increasingly lived beyond its means, hungry for goods from the emerging economies of Holland, France, Britain, Sweden and Denmark. As those countries developed to meet demand, Spain unwittingly produced a trading rival in the shape of Britain, which devised better, more technologically advanced warships to fight the Armada. Hundreds of years later, America has become a highly indebted nation and consequently has been forced to relinquish some its economic power to China, India and Brazil, and this in large part explains why the dollar has crashed on the foreign exchanges. The rise of new economies has, in turn, encouraged companies in the West to outsource production to Latin America, Asia and Central Europe, where people will work for a $1 an hour, not $30. Against this backdrop, it is little wonder that the dollar has been falling and that it has declined even during times of strong US economic growth, as was enjoyed in 2004-2007. Paul Mackel, currency strategist at HSBC, says central banks &apos;realised some time ago that they didn&apos;t want to be too overweight in dollars. The overall dollar holdings of the world&apos;s central banks have come down from 73 per cent to 64 per cent.&apos; The biggest gainer has been the euro, pushing up its share from 18 per cent to 26 per cent, but also sterling, which had a strong run against the eurozone in 2003-2006. Central bank holdings of the pound doubled in five years to 5 per cent. The tilt away from the dollar is a slow, subtle process. Ashram Laidi of CMC Markets says: &apos;If people heard that the Saudis were dumping dollars and buying euros, you would probably get a run on the US currency and that isn&apos;t going to help anyone, especially big investors in dollar assets such as the Saudis.&apos; Developing nations have opted for the softer option of setting up sovereign wealth funds whose currency portfolios are less than transparent, although analysts believe they are &apos;euro-heavy&apos;. These sovereign wealth funds are the most visible manifestation of a shift of economic power from West to East. But economist Tim Congdon doesn&apos;t think the dollar will significantly diminish in importance as, crucially, the US is still the leading exporter of military technologies. As these sell in dollars, it makes sense for nations such as Taiwan to peg their currency to the greenback, or risk paying through the nose for military hardware with a potentially fragile currency.  A more pressing question is to what extent the Chinese authorities will let the yuan appreciate against the dollar. The Americans have been pushing the Chinese to revalue their currency in order to stem the tide of cheap Chinese imports. In fact, the Chinese have been letting the yuan appreciate against the dollar at a rate of around 8 per cent a year, reflecting the country&apos;s burgeoning economic power. But there is a downside to China&apos;s rapid development, in the form of domestic inflation running at 8.7 per cent, an 11-year high. According to the latest Bank of England quarterly report, there is scant evidence that inflationary pressure is feeding through to higher prices for Chinese finished goods such as clothes and DVDs. But the West is feeling the pain of higher commodity prices in the East, particularly fuel, which Chinese industry needs in increasing amounts to feed its huge industrial machine.  Ben Simpfendorfer, China strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland, says: &apos;Five years out the West could be importing inflation by being forced to pay more for finished Chinese products. There are already labour shortages, water shortages, iron ore shortages... The West has enjoyed a period of deflation thanks to China, but it won&apos;t last.&apos; If the yuan appreciated significantly and Beijing pushed up interest rates to head off inflationary pressures, the Chinese currency could become attractive to investors. But King, for one, isn&apos;t expecting big changes soon. &apos;History tells us that the rankings of international currencies change only very slowly,&apos; he says. Even so, there could be a tipping point. Frankel, thinks it will be in 2015, when he predicts that the euro will usurp the dollar for the first time as the world&apos;s premier currency.  But King warns that rumours of the dollar&apos;s demise have been around for years, and tend to be exaggerated. &apos;You really shouldn&apos;t write it off, not for a long time yet,&apos; he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/31/olympicgames2008.olympics2012", "publicationDate": "2008-03-30T23:04:13Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Olympic Games 2012", "China", "Tibet", "World news", "UK news", "Protest", "Politics", "Sport", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["Hasn&apos;t China itself sat at home because of Taiwan?"], "title": "Peter Preston: Playing the boycott game", "article": "You can write much of the script for London 2012 already: the tube strikes, the cost over-runs, the security computers that won&apos;t work and the Kazakh weightlifters lost in Terminal Five. Factor fat helpings of familiar chaos. But the real problem for the Olympic games we thought we wanted to host is beginning to emerge from the smog over Beijing. Boycotts, boycotts everywhere, and never a pause to think.  Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has given in already. She won&apos;t be going to China this summer, like the Polish prime minister and Czech president. Mr Sarkozy is wandering down the same lightly principled path. Expect more European political defections, plus threatening talk from America&apos;s would-be leaders in election year. Darfur began the chat and Tibet has turned it to hubbub; 2008 will be a time for tender consciences to stay away - and 2012 can&apos;t fail to catch the same virus. Lhasa is more than another bloody clash between Chinese troops and Tibetan demonstrators. It has set a trend that will bang at own door four years&apos; hence.  But surely, you say, boycotts have always been part of the Olympic game? What about 1980 in Moscow, when America (and many more) stayed away because the Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan? Or Los Angeles four years later, tit for tat? Hasn&apos;t China itself sat at home because of Taiwan? True enough: but not the Tibetan point. Sometimes there will be deeds or policies that make withdrawal from sporting contact inevitable. But not yet in Tibet.  The Dalai Lama is an eloquent, gentle man. The struggle for an independent or far more autonomous Tibet attracts attention and sympathy. Beijing has lost friends and failed to influence global opinion. Nevertheless, Tibet remains part of China. No country recognises it as anything else. Its cause is separation, not liberation: and there are plenty of good reasons for caution about that.  Why, for so much trouble, is India so keen to hang on to Kashmir? Because it fears the tides of separatism. Because it fears any negotiation or concession that would encourage others to follow. A standard response. Colombo has only one answer for the Tamils: the same answer as Turkey for the Kurds or Russia for the Chechens. Spain hasn&apos;t toed the Washington line and recognised an independent Kosovo: it has the Catalans and the Basques to worry about.  Separatism can seem an obscure cause. How quaint to be so passionate! How ridiculous, in the teeth of globalisation! How odd the old Northern Ireland seems now! Don&apos;t mention Scotland! But just watch the tension that flickers and flares as the torch goes through town next weekend.  This is a crisis that starts in the streets. Take a high-profile event and try to use it by disrupting it. Invite confrontation in Lhasa and finish in a swill of boycotts and denunciations. Ask an impossible question and, eventually, get thunderous answers from Europe. Sympathy for Beijing? Not much. They promised to do better and haven&apos;t. But in Chinese terms, a &quot;free Tibet&quot; makes a free Kashmir look easy - and far wider turmoil for China lies that way. So sympathy for the wilder side of Tibetan separatism needs throttling back. If Berlin, Prague and Warsaw want to recognise an independent Tibet, that&apos;s their prerogative. But they don&apos;t. They are dealing in gestures. It doesn&apos;t matter if we don&apos;t go to the games, they mutter, the games don&apos;t matter.  Cue London 2012. Cue all the other freedom warriors who have seen what attention protest can bring. Don&apos;t think that the tiger won&apos;t be pulled by its tail again. But surely we are different: everyone loves us, don&apos;t they? Not when Stratford provides such a splendid world stage. Not when mushy precedent is set.

What&apos;s the life expectancy in Burkina Faso, and how many kilometres of roads does it have, both paved and unpaved? What&apos;s the highest point in Hungary, and when does the country next hold elections? If you want facts like these, the CIA World Factbook has an almost inexhaustible supply. Although I&apos;ve picked some random trivia, the World Factbook is a mine of useful information. If you&apos;re visiting a country, it&apos;s handy to have a potted history and basic information about the government, the infrastructure and the standard of living. It also covers things such as ethnicity, religions, local diseases and illicit drugs. If you&apos;re doing business with a country, then it&apos;s useful to know about things like its GDP and sources of income, currency, inflation, family incomes and unemployment rates. As this is a CIA production, there are also entries for the military and &quot;manpower fit for military service&quot;. Bear this in mind if you are planning an invasion.  The Factbook was created as a centralised source of information to avoid duplication of effort by different US government agencies. The first unclassified version was produced in 1971, and it appeared on the net in 1997, celebrating the CIA&apos;s 50th anniversary. The US government provides it copyright-free, too, so you can use the data; just don&apos;t use the CIA&apos;s official seal. Water resources and people trafficking Although the overall look is the same, the Factbook&apos;s content can change quite a lot. The number of countries has expanded, for example, following the break-ups of the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia. The Factbook has also expanded its coverage. Newer categories of interest, sadly, include renewable water resources, major infectious diseases and people trafficking.  On recognising and spelling countries, the Factbook follows the US diplomatic line, and the recommendations of the United States Board on Geographic Names. It therefore has an entry for Burma, instead of Myanmar. It doesn&apos;t have one for Palestine, but it does have separate entries for the West Bank and Gaza Strip: &quot;the areas that could potentially form a future Palestinian state.&quot;  It doesn&apos;t have entries for Guadeloupe or Martinique because these are considered part of France. It does have entries for Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which are parts of Cyprus under British sovereignty \u2014 military bases, in fact. There&apos;s also an entry for the Spratly Islands, whose ownership remains to be resolved. As the Factbook says: &quot;About 45 islands are occupied by relatively small numbers of military forces from China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.&quot; One of the Factbook&apos;s more endearing traits is its use of US features for comparison purposes. Bulgaria, for example, is &quot;slightly larger than Tennessee&quot;, while Tokelau is &quot;about 17 times the size of The Mall in Washington, DC.&quot; Now, of course, you can refer to Tennessee as being slightly smaller than Bulgaria.

What is less well known is that Mill worried more about &quot;public opinion&quot; than about state censorship. As Mill puts it, the tyranny of public opinion is &quot;more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself&quot;. Yes, he was writing in Victorian England and our time may not be as conformist. But it&apos;s worth asking if his worries are still relevant today. My own experience writing about China suggests that it depends on the context. Today, Mill&apos;s thesis is right about the west but wrong about China. In China, it will come as no great surprise that the heavy hand of state censorship is the biggest problem. Chinese translations of my own books have been approved for publication, but they are being held up because the material is too &quot;sensitive&quot;. Actually, I&apos;m not a free speech fundamentalist. I made and OK-ed revisions so that the book would get through the political censors. I&apos;m perfectly willing to rewrite an argument in a somewhat roundabout or indirect way if that&apos;s what it takes for my writings to see the light of day. I&apos;m even willing to cut an argument or an example if it&apos;s not central to the main thesis. But, apparently, these cuts have not been sufficient. First I was told that we&apos;d have to wait until after the 17th party congress held last October, because it&apos;s best not to rock the boat during party congresses, held every five years. This year, the need for stability during the Olympics means that writers must be &quot;cautious&quot;. Who knows what it will be next year? I should say that publishers and editors in China are on my side and want my books to be published. But they must get approval from party apparatchiks, elderly revolutionary comrades who may not share modern ideas about the importance of free intellectual exchange. Why are they given power to make decisions? I&apos;d argue the traditional value of respect for the elderly still plays an important role. This makes me optimistic about the future: things should improve once the relatively openminded new generation of leaders occupy more positions of power. That might take a couple of decades, though glasnost-like signals from the top would help to speed things up. In western countries, by contrast, the real threat comes from public opinion. Certain public prejudices make some stories more newsworthy than others, and those stories further reinforce those prejudices. Consider the way that China is demonised in the western press. A social critic beaten up by local thugs is bound to make the headlines in dozens of newspapers (one rarely hears about such occurrences in Uzbekistan, Eritrea, or India). I do not mean to suggest that such facts are unimportant. It&apos;s especially important for western reporters to write about them, since Chinese reporters can rarely do so. But if that&apos;s all people read (or want to read) about China, they will get a very skewed picture of what&apos;s happening in a country of 1.3 billion people that is undergoing the most rapid and comprehensive social transformation in the history of mankind. How many people in the west know that hundreds of millions of Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty? That the majority of Chinese citizens have personal freedoms almost unimaginable 30 years ago? That the Chinese government learned not to overreact to provocations from Taiwanese pro-independence forces, thus paving the way for better relations with Taiwan? That the party has implemented mechanisms for relatively smooth transitions of political power, including mandatory retirement ages for leaders? That European human rights groups are working with the Chinese authorities to reduce the incidence of torture in police investigations? That implementation of the death penalty has been substantially curtailed of late? Or that the official newspaper China Daily recently printed a photo of two young Chinese men in the throes of a passionate kiss in a pro-queer piece headlined Pride and Prejudice? Over the past year, the litany of bad news coming out of China - the poisonous foods and medicines, exploitation in factories and deaths in mines, pollution in Beijing, etc - has shaped and reinforced negative perceptions about China to the point that absurd comparisons between the &quot;genocide&quot; Olympics in Beijing and the &quot;Nazi&quot; Olympics in Berlin can get lots of airplay (a better comparison would be the 1988 Olympics held under an authoritarian regime in Seoul). Does anybody seriously believe that China will launch a world war after the Olympics, like the Nazis did after their Olympics? And where&apos;s the racism that was so central to Nazi ideology? Yes, the Chinese government is indirectly implicated in the killings in Darfur but it&apos;s not alone - Russia sells more weapons to Sudan, and Japan buys more oil - and arguably, it&apos;s working to improve the situation. Yes, it oppresses the Tibetan people and any political solution needs to involve the Dalai Lama, though he has not always been politically realistic in the past. But one might have thought that the recent killings of Chinese civilians and burning of Chinese shops had punctured the idealised view of peace-loving Tibetans in the western mind, yet the riots and the subsequent crackdown seem to have hardened western opinion against China, with growing calls to boycott the Olympics even though the Dalai Lama himself has argued against it. I&apos;ve received emails from western friends asking me about the oppressive atmosphere in China, as though the whole country is under military siege. Anything positive about China leads to accusations about being an &quot;apologist&quot; for the regime. Once in a while, a story that attempts to provide some context or balance gets placed in the western press, but they are drowned out by the daily drumbeat of hostile reports. Why do I worry about the one-sided reporting in western countries? It&apos;s not just that the &quot;nattering nabobs of negativity&quot; reinforce public fears about China that occasionally seem to border on racism, with Chinese influence viewed as inherently malevolent unless it conforms to western values and practices. Such reporting actually makes things worse in China, stoking up crude nationalist responses and making the government more paranoid. It also detracts from thinking about pragmatic solutions to problems. There are progressive forces within the Chinese Communist party - a huge organisation with 73 million members - and those forces should not be dismissed out of hand. For example, the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao has toned down rhetoric towards the Dalai Lama and left the door open for negotiations. Most worrisome, the trend to demonise China plays right into the hands of rightwing militarists looking for another excuse to test their weapons. As the Atlantic correspondent James Fallows writes, &quot;the same people - same individuals, same organisations, same publications, same blog sites - that ginned up a war with Iraq, and that have supported ginning up a war with Iran, are settling in for a longer-term confrontation with China.&quot; If John McCain becomes the next US president, such people will be welcomed at the White House and they will be supported by public opinion and hostile reporting about the new &quot;Evil Empire&quot;. That is really scary."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/05/politics", "publicationDate": "2008-04-04T23:15:50Z", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "Politics"], "sentences": ["Margaret Macmillan&apos;s much-acclaimed study of Sino-US relations, Seize the Hour, refers only in passing to Zhou Enlai&apos;s offer in the mid-50s of &quot;a settlement of outstanding issues, especially Taiwan&quot;."], "title": "Review: John Gittings on a selection of recent books on China", "article": "Beware the Dragon by Erik Durschmied 352pp, Deutsch, \u00a318.99 Return to Dragon Mountain by Jonathan Spence 332pp, Quercus, \u00a320 Treasures of China: The Glories of the Kingdom of the Dragon by John Chinnery 224pp, Duncan Baird, \u00a325 The Dragon Throne by Jonathan Fenby 255pp, Quercus, \u00a316.99 The Dragon and the Foreign Devils by Harry Gelber 512pp, Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99 The Rise of the Dragon by Kerry Brown 213pp, Chandos, \u00a359.95 Managing the Dragon by Jack Perkowski 325pp, Crown Business, $27.50 Silicon Dragon by Rebecca A Fannin 181pp, McGraw Hill, \u00a313.99 The Chinese dragon does not breathe fire nor does it hold virgin maidens captive: it is a generally benign creature which causes the rain to fall and brings fertility to couples - the dragon and phoenix together symbolise a happy marriage. There are nine types of dragon; they have nine times nine scales; they like eating swallows; they ascend to heaven on waterspouts but can also shrink to the size of a silkworm. There are celestial dragons who protect the gods, and treasure dragons who guard the pearl of wisdom. Dragons can misbehave - one of the Taoist Immortals carries a dragon-slaying sword, and Monkey had to deal with a disobedient dragon - but they are on the whole a good thing for humanity. It is very different from the western view which, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics, seems to have become obligatory for publishers and their marketing departments. Here be dragons, eight of them in the current bunch - only one short of the auspicious nine - a fearsome brood with claws outstretched and mostly coloured red. Generalisations about China, the great historian John King Fairbank once wrote, are &quot;the sort of thing we should learn in the eighth grade&quot; and then spend a lifetime breaking down into reality. By this standard the persistence of the dragon clich\u00e9 means we still have a lot of work to do. The most frightening dragon is offered by Erik Durschmied, who urges us, simply, to beware: while China was regarded for centuries as &quot;an ancient dragon enfolded in a sleep of ages&quot;, it was really writing &quot;pages in blood in the world&apos;s chronicle&quot;. This 1,000 years of bloodshed - the subtitle of his book - dates from the Mongol invasion of Europe to the &quot;Chinese hordes&quot; in the Korean war. Durschmied acknowledges (a) that this is a period of only seven, not 10, centuries, and (b) that the Mongols were not Chinese at all - but we should still beware. Long before the Kaiser spoke of the &quot;yellow peril&quot;, China gave us what Durschmied calls the yellow scourge - the black death which, contrary to the accepted view, originated in the putrefaction of unburied corpses after a Chinese earthquake. Western civilisation then had a narrow escape when the Ming dynasty naval explorer Zheng He was ordered to turn back by a poorly advised young emperor. If Zheng had continued sailing westwards, he would have annihilated the merchant fleets of Venice, Genoa and the Sultan of Istanbul. Finally we arrive, via years of Chinese &quot;chaos and carnage&quot;, at the 21st century, when the age-old quest of emperors and khans may come true and China will rule the world. Unless the menace of Chinese bird flu gets us first, flying across the world on &quot;unstoppable wings&quot;. Chairman Mao would have praised this book as a &quot;negative example&quot;, well worth studying to understand the continuing depths of anti-China prejudice, and that is how it should be read - if at all. The dragon presented to us by Jonathan Spence (who may be regarded as the Fairbank of our times) is a much more sympathetic one. Dragon Mountain, in whose shadow the historian Zhang Dai grew up and where he returned (hence the title) after the Ming dynasty collapsed in 1644, was a friendly place nestling next to the city of Shaoxing south of the Yangtze. We would call it a hill: it only took 15 minutes climbing past shrines and temples to reach the top. Zhang is best known for his nostalgic essays - his &quot;dream recollections&quot;, which he wrote in middle age - about the pleasures of a younger life spent organising lantern festivals, staging amateur operas, in poetry reading, cock-fighting and watching the moon in company with courtesans. Zhang&apos;s father may have died after too many goose-eating competitions. In later life Zhang would write his own obituary: &quot;As a youth he was a real dandy,&quot; he began, &quot;in love with the idea of excess.&quot; But when he turned 50, his world was obliterated and he sought refuge in the mountains, wearing cotton clothes and eating coarse vegetables. His life becomes a personal metaphor for dynastic decline. Eventually Zhang returned to Shaoshan and lived a more modest life, again on the slopes of Dragon Mountain. He also resumed work on a history of the Ming dynasty which he had carried with him on his flight. In an un-squeamish epitaph which might be applied to the end of every Chinese regime right up to the fall of Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang wrote that &quot;the flies and maggots were already writhing in the privies before the bandits got there&quot;. The last emperor, Chongzhen, had left his frontier troops unpaid for years while he filled the treasury with huge sums, and sent eunuchs to gouge more taxes out of the rural heartland. Zhang failed to add that the luxurious lifestyle of the elite to which he belonged - many of them absentee landowners who ignored the peasants&apos; plight - also helped to bring down the dynasty. My only criticism of Spence&apos;s fluent narration is that he sometimes seems a shade too indulgent towards their excesses. The Manchu emperors, like those of the Ming, sat on the Dragon Throne, and their imperial robes were embroidered with five-clawed dragons. Yet this identification with the mythical creature was based not on terror but on a shared role in promoting life and welfare &quot;within the four seas&quot;. It was a dragon, assisted by a giant tortoise, who had helped the Great Yu, founder of the first Xia dynasty, to tame China&apos;s floods. He did so by dragging his tail behind him to score the paths of rivers and dykes (the tortoise followed behind, carrying the excavated mud on his back). It is no wonder that the great rivers are themselves compared to dragons: Shanghai boasts that it is the &quot;head of the (Yangtze) dragon&quot;. The first page of Treasures of China shows a dragon-like Yellow river, splendidly sinuous as it winds through remote Qinghai province (birthplace of the Dalai Lama). John Chinnery has taught and inspired British students - I was once one of them - for more than half a century, and his guide to &quot;the glories of the Kingdom of the Dragon&quot; is a fluent and authoritative cultural history with superb illustrations. Buddhism has always inspired China&apos;s greatest art, and Chinnery includes a special section on Dazu, the Buddhist caves in Sichuan rediscovered in 1945, with their quirkily lifelike faces of humans as well as gods. There is also a beautifully sensual Buddha from the Qingzhou hoard, found by workmen digging up a school playing-field in Shandong 12 years ago. Jonathan Fenby&apos;s The Dragon Throne, also of coffee-table size, focuses more on China&apos;s history than its culture - ideal for those who want to sort out their Qin from their Qing. More than 150 emperors sat on the throne, and they are nearly all listed here. Fenby has the journalist&apos;s ear for an entertaining anecdote, though these can be less than accurate when recorded by a succeeding hostile dynasty. We are told that the fifth-century AD emperor Wendi was succeeded by a string of incompetent rulers: one was a drunkard, the next was killed by his own officers, the third poisoned 33 family members, and the fourth &quot;amused himself by shooting blunt arrows at a target daubed on the stomach of a sleeping minister&quot;. The Dragon Throne has some fine pictures of emperors and beauties, paintings and porcelain, fierce warriors and foreign foes, though the captions are less informative than those in Chinnery&apos;s volume. Draconologists should be aware that the horned beast on Fenby&apos;s frontispiece is actually a qilin - sometimes referred to as the &quot;Chinese unicorn&quot;. The same image is correctly identified in Treasures of China. Everyone thinks they know that China - Zhongguo - means the Middle Kingdom, and this is the starting-point of China&apos;s sino-centrism, still supposedly characteristic today. In fact Zhongguo is better translated as the &quot;central country&quot;: as Chinnery tells us, it originally meant the principalities in the Yellow river region. Later Zhongguo came to represent the political legitimacy of the ruling state rather than a geographical location. It was the 18th-century European missionaries who gave the term its sino-centric gloss. Harry Gelber urges us in The Dragon and the Foreign Devils to look at China not in isolation but connected to the outside world. The interest of other states and societies in China ebbed and flowed over the centuries, just as China at different times showed interest or lack of interest in them. By the time that western mercantile imperialism came knocking at China&apos;s door, the Qing dynasty was in a more inward-looking mood, over-extended by earlier expansion and troubled by population pressure on land. But keeping the west at bay also seemed prudent, even prescient: Gelber quotes the great Kangxi emperor who, in 1717, when Russia was the only foreign power nudging China&apos;s borders, warned that &quot;in centuries or millennia to come China may be endangered by collision with the nations of the west&quot;. Gelber&apos;s approach is informative and wide-ranging, and his new paperback edition is modestly priced. Kerry Brown in The Rise of the Dragon also reflects, at a rather staggering price, on the ebb and flow of China&apos;s external relations. This study of inward and outward investment in China - the future, he argues, depends on how far China will invest abroad - begins with a lively sketch of its modern economic history, reminding us that &quot;on a longer view China had the world&apos;s largest economy for 18 of the last 20 centuries&quot;. Brown sees the Maoist period of self-reliance as an aberration: since 1978 China has returned &quot;to its default position, as an increasingly free, open economy, restarting a process that was begun in the 1920s and 1930s&quot;. This standard view of post-1949 Chinese history is now shared within China by its 21st-century modernisers. We may overlook too easily the extent to which Mao&apos;s China and Mao himself were driven into deeper isolation because they were, to put it simply, isolated by the west. Mao&apos;s offer to fly to Washington in 1945 to talk with President Roosevelt, and the overtures to the US which he authorised a decade later, suggest at least the potential for a different outcome. All of this is usually ignored. Margaret Macmillan&apos;s much-acclaimed study of Sino-US relations, Seize the Hour, refers only in passing to Zhou Enlai&apos;s offer in the mid-50s of &quot;a settlement of outstanding issues, especially Taiwan&quot;. Today&apos;s Chinese dragon is associated with entrepreneurs rather than em-perors, and US businessman Jack Perkowski believes he has learnt how to ride it. Managing the Dragon is subtitled &quot;How I&apos;m building a billion-dollar business in China&quot;. Perkowski says that any company that misses out on the China market is doomed to a second-class future, and that it is crucial to find the right Chinese managers - not necessarily the ones who speak the best English. The son of a blue-collar family in Pittsburgh, he is impressed, and rightly so, by how incredibly hard Chinese people will work. He also argues that China may have more incentive to develop new energy-saving technologies than the west. Perkowski&apos;s approach to China, like that of many western business people, is a mixture of insight and arrogance. Don&apos;t make a fuss if you don&apos;t get your coffee the way you want it, he advises new arrivals, or there is no ice in your drink. The fact is that China is still &quot;going through its adolescent stage&quot;. In Silicon Dragon, Rebecca Fannin talks to a dozen or so of these &quot;adolescents&quot;, all successful entrepreneurs in China&apos;s hi-tech revolution. Her interviews are breathless but revealing. All of her subjects were born during or just before the cultural revolution, often in poor families or with parents who were sent to the countryside. Some have studied at Silicon Valley or elsewhere in the US but the latest generation of technological innovators, whom US venture capitalists are lining up to back, are entirely home-grown. Liu Yingkui, 31-year-old inventor of software for selling insurance and other financial products via mobile phones, calls his company Oriental Wisdom, and says he wants to combine Confucius with capitalism. Yes, this is definitely a new sort of dragon."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/07/mergersandacquisitions.acquisitions", "publicationDate": "2008-04-06T23:03:15Z", "tags": ["Mergers and acquisitions", "Mergers, acquisitions and funding", "Technology", "Business"], "sentences": ["The company, which manufactures its chips in Taiwan, is targeting the burgeoning wireless data card market, while its chips are also being tested for use in mobile phones that can access the internet."], "title": "UK microchip designer buys up Canadian rival", "article": "The Bristol-based wireless microchip designer Icera, backed by some of the technology sector&apos;s biggest venture capital firms as well as mobile phone maker Motorola, is buying the rival Canadian firm Sirific Wireless as it positions itself for a $2bn (\u00a31bn) flotation by the end of the decade. The all-share merger, for an undisclosed sum, will see Sirific&apos;s backers, including chip giant Intel and Wales&apos; first billionaire Terry Matthews, become Icera shareholders. So far, Icera has raised $142.5m in five funding rounds from companies including Balderton Capital, the backers of social networking website Bebo, Accel Partners, which financed Facebook and the file-sharing system BitTorrent, and Lastminute.com investors Amadeus Capital Partners. Icera, founded in 2002, has developed technology that makes its chips smaller, faster and cheaper to produce than existing components. The company, which manufactures its chips in Taiwan, is targeting the burgeoning wireless data card market, while its chips are also being tested for use in mobile phones that can access the internet.  The mobile broadband market is expected to grow from its current base of roughly 90 million subscribers worldwide to more than 1.3 billion in 2012. While Icera&apos;s first data card product, which allows laptop users to connect to mobile phone networks, started selling in Japan last year, it expects to see sales rise dramatically as 2008 progresses. The market for making chips for data cards is currently dominated by Qualcomm, but mobile phone companies and device manufacturers have become increasingly concerned about the US company&apos;s dominance of what is seen as the next area of growth in mobile services. &quot;The market wants to have alternatives to Qualcomm and it looks like we are getting the traction to become that alternative,&quot; said Stan Boland, president and chief executive of Icera. Icera has clinched a crucial deal to supply its chips to a Belgian company called Option, which has an 80% share of the laptop data card market in Europe. Products are due to start shipping later this year. It is in talks with other players in the data card industry, which is dominated by Option, Sierra Wireless and Novatel, although two new far eastern firms, Huawei and ZTE, have recently enjoyed success. The American phone company AT&amp;T has already signed up for Icera-based cards, while Orange is also understood to have certified Icera&apos;s kit. The company had been working with Sirific, using its radio transceivers alongside Icera&apos;s own power management technology and innovative processor chip to supply an all-inclusive wireless modem to data card manufacturers.  Icera reckons the decision to buy the Canadian start-up will increase its power to grab a major slice of the mobile broadband market. Boland believes he can get a 33% share of the global data card market by the end of next year.  Icera expects a further round of funding this year, looking to raise as much as $100m. Longer term, however, the plan is to take the business public with a flotation on the London Stock Exchange. &quot;Our aim is to become a substantial chip company with its roots here in Europe,&quot; Boland said. &quot;We think we can take the company public in two years&apos; time.&quot; By that time he estimates the firm will have revenues of $150m to $200m, before taking into account any revenues generated by Sirific and any success the combined company has in breaking into the mobile phone market.  Based on valuations elsewhere in the chip sector, that would suggest a flotation valuation of $1.5bn to $2bn."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/07/recycling.ethicalliving", "publicationDate": "2008-04-07T14:39:03Z", "tags": ["Recycling", "Ethical and green living", "Education", "Schools", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Environment", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Breakthroughs in flaking, chipping and spinning plastic at a plant in Taiwan have made &quot;blazers with bottle&quot; commercially viable, with the clothing tailored in Europe to avoid the use of child labour.", "The kit costs about \u00a31 more than conventional school uniforms, according to Mark Southcott, of the Knaresborough company School Colours, which has tailored the first consignment of the new material from Taiwan."], "title": "Schools offered uniforms made from old bottles", "article": "Schools struggling to meet carbon footprint targets are about to be offered a shortcut - the chance to dress their pupils in a uniform made entirely from old Coca-Cola bottles.

The denials are emphatic that they did not, and the idea of emollient Jack threatening to take a swing at a colleague 20 years his junior lacks plausibility. He&apos;s not John Prescott. There again, these are stressful times. Never mind. It does happen. Italian politicians often get into brawls in the chamber and have so much to get excited about. They do in the Knesset too, I think. Japan? Yes. Taiwan? By all means. Two MPs were hospitalised in 2005. In 2006 a colleague slapped the Czech health minister in a moment of heat. Why even MEPs have been known to lash out. Australia, did you say? The Canberra parliament is a place where they don&apos;t deploy the namby-pamby third-party (&quot;If I may say to the honourable gentleman&apos;&apos;) device to keep temperatures down. MPs routinely call each other very rude names, occasionally worse. Nowadays it&apos;s all on TV for voters who are by no means averse to thumping a neighbour across the barbie, but expect better of their betters. We heard at the weekend about sharp words traded between Mark Penn and Mandy Grunwald, before Penn departed the Clinton campaign team. But that was in private anyway. I&apos;ve been racking my brains to think of physical violence between politicians that I&apos;ve actually witnessed. I don&apos;t count my own trading blows with Alastair Campbell the day Robert Maxwell died, November 5 1991, which others witnessed. For one thing we were both only hacks at the time, so we don&apos;t count, though I got a stern letter of reprimand from the speaker, Jack Weatherill, for misconduct in the press gallery. For another thing, though we were both at fault (I hadn&apos;t realised Campbell was about to be sacked by the new management), he turned out to be wronger in the long run. I said Cap&apos;n Bob was a crook. Two weeks later they found the hole in the pension fund. Tom Swain and Norman Tebbit, ah yes, I knew there was some half-buried thought there. Back in the days when young Norman was a promising Thatcherite backbencher, he said something offensive - a talent that stood him in good stead, he retains it still - which offended the Derbyshire miner MP. Swain was older than Tebbit - like Jack and Ed, you could say - and had once been a fair ground boxer. You just knew he could still handle himself. As I recall, he invited Norman outside in a distinctly menacing way. Norman stayed put: not much of a story. Bernadette Devlin, the republican MP from west Belfast, really did slap Reggie Maudling, Tory home secretary, but that was before my time. And of course, there has been third party violence against MPs in recent years: all sorts of things, from purple powder to horse shit, thrown over the public gallery rail before they put up a glass wall in honour of Bin Laden&apos;s video menace. And several MPs were murdered during Irish republicanism&apos;s long war with the British state, Airey Neave in his car on the car park ramp below Big Ben in 1979. Does it matter? Yes. Is it a good or bad thing? Basically bad. Grown-ups should show self-control. So I am relieved to note that the BBC&apos;s top 10 TV confrontational moments don&apos;t include violence or silliness between elected politicians. That is what lies behind the red stripes still visible on the green carpet of the House of Commons. When speaking, an MP should never cross the red line: it&apos;s a breach of standing orders designed to help keep order. Memory says that Tommy Swain did cross the line that day in the late 1970s. The two lines are two sword lengths apart. But there are no hard and fast rules. When during the 2001 election campaign, a demonstrator threw an egg at John Prescott from close quarters, it felt to Prescott that he had been hit. So he did what came naturally to him and hit back. A very creditable left hook for a man of his age, I thought, watching it. Could Jack Straw do as well? Probably not. When Blair and Campbell later reproached him in a half-hearted way, Prescott cited the Campbell-White precedent in his defence. Frankly, we weren&apos;t that good, it wasn&apos;t on telly and YouTube hadn&apos;t been invented. To Number 10&apos;s surprise voters seem to have sided with Prezza.

Reports that the Chinese government has called for bids from foreign PR companies indicate that Beijing, at some level, understands that its own attempts to mould world opinion have tanked. But if the exercise is to have any success, the client does, occasionally, need to take the advice. It would not be an easy account to manage. On the day that the Olympic torch - or, as Beijing calls it, &quot;the sacred flame&quot; - went into hiding in a San Francisco warehouse, Beijing&apos;s second in command in Tibet, Qiangba Puncog, held a press conference. He was talking against the background of another news management failure: the appearance of a group of monks at the lovely and historic Labrang monastery in Gansu, bearing a Tibetan flag to remind a visiting press party that this was another propaganda exercise. Puncog joined the Communist party in the cultural revolution, and his political attitudes do not seem to have progressed much. He epitomises the policies that have helped to generate this perfect storm of bad publicity for China. Of his fellow Tibetans he observed, in a phrase that would not have shamed a recalcitrant 19th-century imperialist, &quot;I believe Tibetans are a good, simple people who know how to be grateful&quot;. And in the event of any of these humble, grateful people disrupting the torch relay through Tibet, he promised: &quot;They will be dealt with severely.&quot; As western political leaders glumly contemplated their August diaries, conscious that there were no good options, Beijing&apos;s putative public relations consultants must have been reaching for the hemlock. Since the unrest in Tibet began, everything Beijing has done and said has reinforced its critics&apos; case. The foreign press is accused, in strident terms, of lying, while its capacity to report directly is cut off by Beijing. Behind a security cordon, overwhelming force has been brought to bear. Precisely how it is being used we do not know, but when an authority with a violent past reaches for a stick and slams the door shut, there is little reason to be sanguine. As the trouble spread last month to the Tibetan areas of Gansu, Sichuan and Qinghai, convoys of trucks carrying military police fanned out across the Tibetan plateau. The faces in the trucks looked young, but the fixed bayonets leaning against the tailboards spoke of their seriousness of purpose. No foreign visitor could testify directly to the result because the provincial foreign affairs bureaux were already at work, combing through the hotels for foreigners who were to be swept back to the cities, where they would be blind to further trouble or reprisals. Chinese migrants sat in flyblown restaurants watching the official story on television, scenes of riot on a loop, played and replayed, cursing Tibetans for what viewers had been told was unprovoked violence against hardworking Chinese migrants. Tibetans kept their distance, wary of revenge attacks. The exercise was reminiscent of China&apos;s recent, closed, dogmatic past, when all citizens were obliged to subscribe to the official version of events, however much they might privately dissent. A dictatorship can oblige this acceptance of a single narrative as the price of living unmolested in the state, but it only works if the outside world, with its diverse point of view and different stories, is kept at bay. The method, though, is incompatible in a society open to the outside world, as China now wishes to be. The story of China in the past month is tragic on many levels. Prepared to fling open the doors to show off its best furniture and fashionable new clothes, official China is snarling in a corner instead, its confident image shredded by the real-time street theatre of London, Paris and San Francisco. The issue is no longer confined to Tibet. Now it is about the nature of China&apos;s rise, and a leadership capable of misreading the reactions of others so catastrophically. It is revealed as a regime that clings to symbolic politics, without realising that symbols carry different messages and, in the wider world, nobody can monopolise how they are read. What is now at risk is not only the success of the Olympics, but the direction of Chinese politics. This matters to us all, so here, at no charge and with respect, are some suggestions. Firstly, stop digging. The torch relay was introduced at the 1936 Berlin Olympics as a triumphalist exercise. Proposing to run the longest relay ever, and including Taiwan and Tibet, was bound to open Beijing to the charge of exploiting an international sporting symbol for a nationalist agenda. At this point, the more security the torch needs, the more negative the message.  Secondly, get some honest advice and listen to it. In intolerant, top-down systems, subordinates tell the boss what they think he wants to hear. By the time the boss discovers the deception, the damage has been done. It may be painful to admit errors in public, but it would have a positive effect. In grown-up systems, the humbling of politicians is something in which the people can take pride, rather than feel as a national humiliation. Thirdly, it&apos;s time to take the initiative back, sit down for talks with the Dalai Lama and take a hard look at China&apos;s record in Tibet. To insist that the Dalai Lama is single-handedly responsible for the failure of China&apos;s policies in Tibet just makes Beijing look ridiculous internationally and does nothing to resolve the crisis. In the long run the choice is between more decades of repression and rebellion, and the chance of a constructive settlement that offers long-term stability for China and cultural survival for Tibet. For the past 50 years Chinese policy in Tibet has provoked intermittent uprisings. It is time to draw the right lessons. When China signed up for the Olympics, it promised to improve human rights and press freedom, as well as to clean up the air and provide impeccable organisation. There have been heroic efforts on air quality, and nobody doubts the logistics or the shining new venues. But on human rights Beijing has fallen back on repression and has thrown away the chance to argue, with justice, that China has made considerable progress in building a legal state, in personal freedoms and in creating prosperity. Now those achievements have been sidelined by a torch that cannot venture on to the streets without an armed escort. There is still a choice to be made, and a change of policy is by far the best decision. So far, Beijing has reached for the tattered flag of nationalism. The official story blames China&apos;s enemies; that line may convince many - even most - Chinese, but if the end of the story is to force 1.3 billion people back into a position of antagonism towards the outside world, when the strategy for the past 15 years has been to open up, what will have been gained? \u00b7 Isabel Hilton is the editor of Chinadialogue.net  isabel.hilton@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/13/4", "publicationDate": "2008-04-12T23:07:19Z", "tags": ["World news"], "sentences": ["Associated Press Crucial talks with China Taiwan&apos;s vice president-elect met with Chinese President Hu Jintao in the highest level political contact between the two governments in nearly 60 years.", "Separated amid civil war in 1949, China and Taiwan have had almost no direct contact between their governments.", "China claims Taiwan as part of its territory."], "title": "World news in brief", "article": "Rice hits out at Carter The US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, has criticised former President Jimmy Carter for his reported plans to meet the exiled leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas on a visit to Syria.

It&apos;s small and light enough - about the size of a paperback book - to fit in an overcoat pocket. It has a 7in screen, a small but fully equipped keyboard and boots up in a few seconds - partly because it has no hard drive. It does, however, have two USB ports which can take flash drives, connect to printers etc, plus a VGA port for connecting up an external monitor, an ethernet socket for hooking up to local area networks or broadband modems, a built-in camera, microphone and wi-fi. And it costs just over \u00a3200, including VAT. The EeePC, which was designed for children, has found its market niche among adults. This tells us a lot about the state of the computer industry. The device is designed to be an information appliance rather than a computer per se. It runs Linux but you don&apos;t have to know that because it comes pre-configured: you switch it on and there it is. What you see are tabs labelled with words like &apos;internet&apos;, &apos;work&apos;, &apos;learn&apos;, &apos;play&apos;, and so on. Click on &apos;internet&apos; and up come icons for web mail, web, Messenger, Skype, Wikipedia and Google Docs. Click on &apos;web mail&apos; and you get icons for Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. Click on the &apos;work&apos; and you get OpenOffice- the Open Source equivalent of Microsoft Office.  The key thing about the ASUS machine - and the reason for its popularity - is that it bypasses most of the complexity of operating a standard computer. To see whether it really could replace my Apple laptop, I took the EeePC with me on a recent trip abroad. When we arrived at the destination I plugged the ASUS machine straight into our hosts&apos; broadband modem and in seconds was on the net. Later in the same trip I noticed that a friend was online in Spain, so clicked on the Skype button and in seconds was engaged in a video call with him. Everywhere I went, it picked up the available wireless networks without fail. On a train journey, I plugged my 3G modem into one of the USB slots and the ASUS detected the device and configured the connection. Easy as falling off a log. (And easier, as a matter of fact, than persuading the aforementioned Apple laptop to work with the same modem.) It would be misleading to say that the ASUS machine is perfect. The screen is a bit too small for extensive browsing (though OK for word processing), the keyboard is a mite too small for most adult fingers and the battery life is disappointing. But these defects are easily remedied - and ASUS reportedly has a Mark II version in the works which will fix most of them. Besides, the limitations of Mark I ought not to blind us to its significance - which is the cruel way it highlights the baroque complexity of conventional computing machines with their bloated operating systems, security problems, flaky hard drives, overheating processors and overweight chassis. Some day, our great-grandchildren will marvel that the industry once standardised on software that required its users to press the &apos;Start&apos; button when they wished to stop their machine. Especially when all we really needed was a life-support system for a browser. The days of the cumbersome, expensive, overweight laptop are ending. There is a huge latent demand for a network appliance like the ASUS machine that just works. And - bang on schedule - last week Hewlett Packard launched an assault on this emergent market with its Mini-Note, which with a bigger screen and keyboard than the ASUS machine but still running Linux and not having a hard disk, retails at just under $500 (\u00a3250).

Victory and good results against Taiwan and United Arab Emirates will steer them into the knockout stages of the Seniors World Cup (SWC). &quot;It&apos;s not quite the real thing, but we&apos;ll line up to the national anthem and they&apos;ll hoist the flag,&quot; says Paul Bell, a chocolate company executive and the squad&apos;s equivalent of England manager Fabio Capello. &quot;We haven&apos;t got Beckham or Rooney but we&apos;re tough and can go the distance.&quot; The vets were picked to fly the red and white flag as one of the country&apos;s leading over-40 clubs, who play by a modified version of the game. Matches are 10 minutes shorter than professional football&apos;s, and if a team takes off a 54-year-old, such as Harrogate wine merchant Ian Skinner, they must substitute someone of a similar age. The series in Bangkok, the third SWC but the first England have entered, is not televised, but England hope holidaymakers and expats will turn up to cheer and chant. Veterans&apos; football is good to watch, says striker Robert Turnbull, a 49-year-old joiner who played for Newcastle United reserves. &quot;What we&apos;ve lost in pace we&apos;ve gained in skill, and the referees tend to be that bit kinder as well.&quot; Harrogate have two ex-Premier League players in their squad, and the SWC has attracted real World Cup veterans in previous tournaments including Felix Magath and Manfred Kaltz, who played for winners Germany last year. Training after a 1-1 draw with Yorkshire village side Bardsey FC this week, players were optimistic about their chances. Builder Ian Blackstone, 44, a former York City player, said: &quot;We can give any side a good kicking, even if we just kick that bit more slowly.&quot; Skinner, billed as the side&apos;s &quot;Rio Ferdinand, only balder&quot;, promises: &quot;Passion - that&apos;s what you get at our age.&quot; Success in Thailand is likely to see an England side selected for future contests by eliminators between veterans&apos; clubs, or selection of star players from across the &quot;mature footballers&quot; board."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/apr/17/pcsalesadvancedespiteusre", "publicationDate": "2008-04-17T12:12:11Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Computing", "Technology", "Technology sector", "Business"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Acer, a newcomer and not well established in the US market, now looks within reach."], "title": "PC sales advance despite US recession, says Gartner", "article": " Gartner has just released preliminary numbers for this year&apos;s first quarter PC market, and it reckons that worldwide PC shipments grew by 12.3% to 71.1 million units compared to 07Q1. The main news is that Dell -- now back under Michael Dell&apos;s control -- is staging a recovery. It&apos;s still behind Hewlett-Packard, but growing faster. Also, all the top 5 grew strongly, so there was effectively a shift towards the major brand names. The &quot;others&quot; category lost 3.6 percentage points of market share, falling to 46.3%, in spite of recent successes such as Apple and Asus.  The US PC market was soft, growing only 3%. However, as Gartner says:  Dell extended its lead in the US PC market with its market share reaching 31.4%. Dell&apos;s channel program, Partner Direct, launched in December 2007, started yielding dividends, as well as its retail expansion. HP registered its lowest year-on-year growth since the Compaq merger in 2003.    Acer appeared to decline, but its new numbers include Gateway&apos;s consumer shipments and Packard Bell sales, following takeovers. Whether it can turn these around is open to doubt. Apple grew fastest, among the leading US brands, gaining 1.4 percentage points to take 6.6% of the US market. Apple&apos;s climb has been assisted by the disappearance of most of the major US-based PC manufacturers -- Compaq, IBM, Gateway, Packard Bell and eMachines were all former Top 5 members -- but it has overtaken Japan&apos;s Sony and now Toshiba to reach fourth place. Taiwan&apos;s Acer, a newcomer and not well established in the US market, now looks within reach. In Europe, HP took top spot with 28% growth, ahead of Acer and Dell. Toshiba, in fifth place, grew shipments by 36.1% and is closing on Fujitsu Siemens. Gartner says all the vendors benefited from strong growth in mobile PC sales, &quot;with Lenovo, Asus and Sony reaching growth well above the market average.&quot; Gartner also says: &quot;In Asia/Pacific, PC shipments reached 19.1 million units in the first quarter of 2008, a 19% increase from the same period last year.&quot; Latin America PC shipments grew 19.1% to 6.3 million units.

Asia", "article": "The recent commentary on China, India and other Asian markets has focused on whether they will be hit by the credit crunch and the slowdown that will inevitably follow. In the short term, there is little doubt that the Asian markets will suffer some impact from a US recession and slowing growth elsewhere. But the debate about &apos;decoupling&apos; - the word of the moment - risks ignoring the fact that Asia is already becoming the powerhouse of economic growth and that this trend can only accelerate, regardless of short-term ups and downs. Burkhard Varnholt, chief investment officer of private bank Bank Sarasin, points out that the Asia Pacific region already accounts for almost 37 per cent of the global economy, measured on the basis of purchasing power parity. Its contribution to global growth is even greater: China alone supplied 17 per cent, more than the US, and emerging Asia as a whole accounted for 40 per cent. &apos;The world economy has now decoupled from its historic US economic leadership in unprecedented ways. The global economic boom is not dead - its engines have simply changed,&apos; he says. The Asian engines are certainly powering up: as any visitor to Beijing can see, China has invested 300 billion yuan (\u00a322bn) in the Olympics alone; add in the huge spending on power stations, rail and road infrastructure, water projects and the rest, and capital investment in the next decade or so will run at hundreds of times that. That will be financed by the huge trade and foreign exchange surpluses built up by its role as supplier of the world&apos;s consumer staples. These staples are increasingly going to its own population, however, and those of neighbouring Asian economies as they start to benefit from the growing wealth of their countries, and with 1.3 billion people - around four times as many as in the US - that adds up to a lot of demand. It also explains the optimism about the sustainability of China&apos;s growth in the face of a US slowdown, albeit at a rate perhaps slightly less rapid than the 11 per cent-plus seen over the past few years. Indeed, the World Bank estimates that less than a fifth of Chinese exports now go to the US.  Interest in Chinese and Asian funds has grown rapidly in recent years, stimulating a wave of new launches, so there is plenty of choice for those who want to invest. Marcel Porcheron at BestInvest picks the First State Greater China fund, run by Martin Lau, which can also invest in Taiwan and Hong Kong, or, for a broader regional exposure, Aberdeen Asia Pacific, which is very conservatively run by veteran manager Hugh Young. But investors do not need to invest directly in China to get the benefit of the China effect: a growing number of fund managers in other regions are also finding ways to cash in on the growth. China is one of the key themes underlying the strategy of Tom Ewing, one of the band of young managers at Fidelity who has just taken over its UK Growth fund. Using his powers to hold some foreign shares, he has a direct investment in the country via China Mobile - which, he points out, is adding 7,000 subscribers every month and, with mobile-phone penetration still low, still has plenty of prospects for growth. But he is also looking for companies in the UK that should cash in on China&apos;s growth, ranging from those with strong international brand portfolios such as Diageo - whose Johnnie Walker whisky is popular in China - to the big mining groups such as Rio Tinto and Xstrata, which are benefiting from its huge demand for commodities.  Ewing&apos;s fund has beaten the FT All Share index handsomely over the past three and six months, but his track record is too short to judge whether his China bet will pay off; poor stock market performance over that period means the fund has lost money despite that outperformance. BestInvest&apos;s Porcheron says a growing number of other UK fund managers are also looking for ways to cash in on China&apos;s growth - including Richard Plackett, manager of the highly rated Blackrock UK Special Situations fund. Those whose portfolio, or appetite for risk, is not large enough to justify investing in a specialist China or Asia fund should consider this, or the Fidelity fund, as an alternative.  An unexpected dividend: Eastern yields are rising Managers investing in Asia have traditionally looked for growth rather than income, but that is changing. Ayaz Ebrahim, chief executive of Halbis, the active fund management specialist arm of HSBC in the Asia Pacific region, points out that yields in the region have been rising as Asian companies ditch their historical antipathy towards paying dividends. Its research shows that 20 per cent of companies in 2007 were paying steadily rising dividends, compared with 15 per cent five years ago, while a further 33 per cent delivered rising dividends with some down years, compared with 23 per cent in 2002.  There are some excellent yields available: Halbis cites examples such as Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan, which yields 6.1 per cent, and Singapore Airlines on 4.1 per cent. If the forecasters are right that the global slowdown will not derail Asia&apos;s progress, that could make their yields even more attractive. Fidelity points out that, while the yields on many British companies look attractive - Alliance &amp; Leicester, for example, is on 10 per cent - that reflects investors&apos; fears that dividends will be cut. A number of companies have already cut their payouts and investors are braced for worse, particularly from the banks. Fidelity&apos;s research shows that just 11 of the 26 companies in the FTSE with yields between 4.5 and 10 per cent have earnings that are more than twice their dividend payouts - a key measure of the risk or otherwise of a dividend cut.  Buyers of income funds should therefore be aware of what their managers are backing - the traditional heavy exposure to the banking sector may not be good news. More adventurous income-seekers could look overseas: Schroders, Henderson and Aberdeen are among those offering attractive Asian income investment or unit trusts."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/apr/22/asushas10inchscreeneeepc", "publicationDate": "2008-04-22T11:04:26Z", "tags": ["Open source", "Windows", "Software", "Gadgets", "Computing", "Technology", "Intel", "Asus"], "sentences": ["DigiTimes in Taiwan has a report on Asus, also in Taiwan, that says: &quot;Asustek Computer president Jerry Shen has revealed the company plans to launch Eee PCs based on Intel&apos;s Atom processor platform in June, and will introduce models with a 10-inch display later in 2008.&quot; The report then looks at local sales of Intel&apos;s new low-cost Atom processor, which is aimed at the internet devices market."], "title": "Asus has 10 inch screen Eee PC coming; Atom sales", "article": "DigiTimes in Taiwan has a report on Asus, also in Taiwan, that says: &quot;Asustek Computer president Jerry Shen has revealed the company plans to launch Eee PCs based on Intel&apos;s Atom processor platform in June, and will introduce models with a 10-inch display later in 2008.&quot; The report then looks at local sales of Intel&apos;s new low-cost Atom processor, which is aimed at the internet devices market.

For years she has been known to consult the stars and tarot readers and to be very susceptible to superstition. In the years before her husband was elected president in November 2006, she used to write op-ed pieces that recorded the phase of the moon along with her signature. As he began his term in office in January of 2007, it was her decision that he wouldn&apos;t occupy the building donated by Taiwan to house the presidential offices. Apparently, she found that the building&apos;s bad vibes had brought death to the families of two former Nicaraguan presidents. One of President Aleman&apos;s sons died tragically in a farm accident and two sons of the next president, Enrique Bola\u00f1os, also died, one from a stroke and the second one from leukaemia. To this day, Daniel Ortega carries out his presidential business from the Sandinista party headquarters, a group of buildings that includes the presidential couple&apos;s home. The meeting hall where Ortega receives foreign dignitaries and gathers his cabinet for important policy announcements has as a backdrop a very 1960s psychedelic mural that features a hand which is supposed to protect and strengthen the presidential couple&apos;s power. A lavish quantity of fresh flowers arranged along a stage - you would not guess Nicaragua is the second poorest country in Latin America - frames each of their public appearances. At the presidential headquarters, people who have been summoned to be interviewed for party or governmental jobs have reported that they have sat for long periods in an empty waiting room only to be told that the &quot;compa\u00f1era&quot;, as Murillo is referred to by her staff, has &quot;seen&quot; them, and that they need to go to a certain address in order to have their aura cleansed. A thin woman who wears three or four rings on each of her fingers and many turquoise and silver bracelets on her arms, Murillo&apos;s rise to power within the Sandinista party is said to be the result of her willingness to side with her husband when her daughter, Zoilamerica Narvaez, publicly denounced her stepfather, accusing him of having sexually abused her since she was 11 years old. Murillo appeared publicly to deny her daughters claims, accusing her of having been &quot;brainwashed&quot;. Her stance won Murillo the influence Ortega had never previously allowed her. He appointed her campaign manager both in his unsuccessful run in 2001, and in 2006 when he finally became president. It was her idea that neither Ortega, nor any Sandinista candidate should grant press interviews during the campaign, or participate in presidential debates. It is clear she is quite aware of the power of words and the ill use her husband tends to make of them. After he was elected, Ortega declared he would favour women&apos;s participation in the government and would start by sharing 50% of his power with his wife. Even though she has never been an elected official, Murillo is nowadays the de facto co-president of Nicaragua. As head of the government&apos;s press office, she has banned cabinet members from speaking to the press without her consent. Those who have dared defy her have been fired on the spot. Dionisio Marenco, Managua&apos;s Sandinista mayor and Ortega&apos;s longtime friend and loyal collaborator, has recently fallen from grace and become the object of Sandinista hostilities because he criticised Murillo&apos;s arbitrary methods and decisions. &quot;Socialism yes, Chayo, no&quot; reads some of the graffiti in Managua. &quot;Chayo&quot; is a nickname given to women called Rosario in Nicaragua, but everyone knows which Chayo the sign refers to. In popular polls, Murillo has one of the lowest approval ratings of any politician in the country. In spite of this, her husband has appointed her national coordinator of their pet project: citizens&apos; councils. These are their version of &quot;direct democracy&quot;, a national web of neighbourhood groups run by loyal party cadres through which the government channels money and foodstuffs along with favours and political influence to those who agree to join. Although the national assembly refused to grant constitutional status to these councils or allow them to receive government funds, Ortega and Murillo have gone ahead with their plans vowing to &quot;defeat the rightwing forces who oppose granting power to the people&quot;. They are betting that these parallel structures will provide the kind of control and influence they seek. If they manage to set them up, they will have closed a power loop that includes the judicial and electoral institutions that are effectively under their control. Perhaps to lessen the effect of Ortega&apos;s rampant and incoherent rhetoric, Murillo lends pomp and circumstance to their public appearances, staging weekly events carefully choreographed with more flowers, music, pink and turquoise drapes and the presence of ambassadors, government ministers and dance groups who patiently listen to Ortega&apos;s words, accompanied by music. Murillo and Ortega have eight children, six of them male, and already adults. When their mother was asked by the press why they accompanied the couple on official visits, sometimes bringing either their girlfriends or their children and nannies, Murillo responded that all of them carry out government functions. Her bony figure, clad in vivid colours that echo the rainbow framing the giant posters of her husband all over the city, Murillo is enshrining what seems to be the reign of another dynasty in Nicaragua. Never mind that she&apos;s preaching direct democracy; her vision for the a new era is equally ruled by auras and astronomical influences."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/apr/25/indiaandchinathefriendlyg", "publicationDate": "2008-04-25T07:55:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "India", "China", "Economics", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["If it were to occur - over Taiwan, say, or the Korean peninsula or Tibet or Pakistan - it would not simply be an intra-Asian affair."], "title": "India and China: the friendly giants", "article": "Why can China build cities overnight while India has trouble building roads? Why does China ban free elections while Indians vote in officials with criminal records? These are just some of the questions the Harvard Business School professor Tarun Khanna takes up in his book, Billions of Entrepreneurs: How China and India Are Reshaping Their Futures and Yours. Listen to Mark Tran&apos;s interview with Tarun Khanna The soft-spoken Khanna, who talked to hundreds of business people and policymakers for his book, has offered an optimistic take on the rise of India and China with their combined population of 2.4 billion. Not for him the scaremongering found among commentators such as the CNN anchor Lou Dobbs, who warns about the loss of American jobs to China, as well as defective Chinese products. In a sense the growing economic might of these two Asian giants - although some would say with feet of clay - is a case of back to the future. In the 1800s as much as 50% of world GDP was accounted for by China and India. Khanna is pragmatic about both countries: they have achieved economic success through very different methods and he lays out the strengths and weaknesses of the two &quot;petri dishes&quot; of economic development. As befitting a Harvard business professor, Khanna is a market liberal. But he acknowledges the effectiveness of China&apos;s top-down approach, a capitalism (of sorts) imposed from above that has lifted millions out of poverty, while creating new cities that rival New York and London. Yet he takes note of the downside; the lack of clear property rights and democratic freedoms that could hinder further economic progress. India&apos;s economic model is a messier affair. In a sometimes raucous democracy, where the voters regularly vote in MPs with criminal records, the task of central government, more often than not, is to get out of the way and let the private sector drive growth and create jobs. India can&apos;t build gleaming cities overnight because the government is too weak to bulldoze slums to make room for skyscrapers. China&apos;s approach to economic development - centred on manufacturing and big infrastructure projects, from dams to rail - and to foreign policy typifies &quot;hard power&quot;. India, with its software industry and Bollywood films, represents &quot;soft power&quot;. Khanna coins the term &quot;mutualism&quot; to describe the synthesis of these two economic approaches that will benefit not just China and India but the rest of the world. He cites the case of GE Healthcare, the health arm of the US corporate giant General Electric. GE was unique because it succeeded both in China and India and its operations are more than a sum of its parts.  GE Healthcare took the best from both countries to develop its medical equipment and has opened research and development centres in Shanghai and Bangalore. Since writing the book, Khanna says he has discovered hundreds more examples of cross-fertilisation. &quot;The ability to set up parallel groups of highly skilled engineering talent in both countries is invaluable,&quot; a GE executive told Khanna. &quot;It raises the efficiency of product development and fits in with a competitive culture within GE.&quot; Not all commentators buy this &quot;rosy scenario&quot;. In his book, Rivals: How the Power Struggle Between China, India and Japan Will Shape Our Next Decade, Bill Emmott, the former editor-in-chief of the Economist, offers a bleaker vision of the rise of Asia.  &quot;An array of disputes, historical bitternesses and regional flashpoints weigh down on all three countries. Conflict is not inevitable but nor is it inconceivable. If it were to occur - over Taiwan, say, or the Korean peninsula or Tibet or Pakistan - it would not simply be an intra-Asian affair. The outside world would be drawn in.&quot; Khanna acknowledges the existence of such security concerns, but thinks it bad social science to extrapolate from the past 40 years of tension between India and China. &quot;It is equally plausible to see the rise of economic development between two friendly countries,&quot; says Khanna, a self-avowed optimist who thinks increased human contact between India and China can only be positive. &quot;There is nothing to suggest hostility between India and China beyond the occasional sabre-rattling over border disputes.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/26/waste.pollution", "publicationDate": "2008-04-25T23:03:24Z", "tags": ["Waste", "Pollution", "Recycling", "Environment", "UK news", "Landfill", "Environmental sustainability"], "sentences": ["In central Europe, Taiwan and elsewhere, NatureWorks polymer is widely accepted as a compostable material.&quot; Other users said it was too soon to judge the new technology."], "title": "'Sustainable' bio-plastic can damage the environment", "article": "The worldwide effort by supermarkets and industry to replace conventional oil-based plastic with eco-friendly &quot;bioplastics&quot; made from plants is causing environmental problems and consumer confusion, according to a Guardian study. The substitutes can increase emissions of greenhouse gases on landfill sites, some need high temperatures to decompose and others cannot be recycled in Britain. Many of the bioplastics are also contributing to the global food crisis by taking over large areas of land previously used to grow crops for human consumption.  The market for bioplastics, which are made from maize, sugarcane, wheat and other crops, is growing by 20-30% a year. The industry, which uses words such as &quot;sustainable&quot;, &quot;biodegradeable&quot;, &quot;compostable&quot; and &quot;recyclable&quot; to describe its products, says bioplastics make carbon savings of 30-80% compared with conventional oil-based plastics and can extend the shelf-life of food.  Concern centres on corn-based packaging made with polylactic acid (Pla). Made from GM crops, it looks identical to conventional polyethylene terephthalate (Pet) plastic and is produced by US company NatureWorks. The company is jointly owned by Cargill, the world&apos;s second largest biofuel producer, and Teijin, one of the world&apos;s largest plastic manufacturers. Pla is used by some of the biggest supermarkets and food companies, including Wal-Mart, McDonald&apos;s and Del Monte. It is used by Marks &amp; Spencer to package organic foods, salads, snacks, desserts, and fruit and vegetables.  It is also used to bottle Belu mineral water, which is endorsed by environmentalists because the brand&apos;s owners invest all profits in water projects in poor countries. Wal-Mart has said it plans to use 114m Pla containers over the course of a year.  While Pla is said to offer more disposal options, the Guardian has found that it will barely break down on landfill sites, and can only be composted in the handful of anaerobic digesters which exist in Britain, but which do not take any packaging. In addition, if Pla is sent to UK recycling works in large quantities, it can contaminate the waste stream, reportedly making other recycled plastics unsaleable. Last year Innocent drinks stopped using Pla because commercial composting was &quot;not yet a mainstream option&quot; in the UK. Anson, one of Britain&apos;s largest suppliers of plastic food packaging, switched back to conventional plastic after testing Pla  in sandwich packs. Sainsbury&apos;s has decided not to use it, saying Pla is made with GM corn. &quot;No local authority is collecting compostable packaging at the moment. Composters do not want it,&quot; a spokesman said. Britain&apos;s supermarkets compete to claim the greatest commitment to the environment with plant-based products. The bioplastics industry expects rising oil prices to help it compete with conventional plastics, with Europe using about 50,000 tonnes of bioplastics a year. Concern is mounting because the new generation of biodegradable plastics ends up on landfill sites, where they degrade without oxygen, releasing methane, a greenhouse gas 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. This week the US national oceanic and atmospheric administration reported a sharp increase in global methane emissions last year.  &quot;It is just not possible to capture all the methane from landfill sites,&quot; said Michael Warhurt, resources campaigner at Friends of the Earth. &quot;A significant percentage leaks to the atmosphere.&quot; &quot;Just because it&apos;s biodegradable does not mean it&apos;s good. If it goes to landfill it breaks down to methane. Only a percentage is captured,&quot; said Peter Skelton of Wrap, the UK government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme. &quot;In theory bioplastics are good. But in practice there are lots of barriers.&quot; Recycling companies said they would have to invest in expensive new equipment to extract bioplastic from waste for recycling. &quot;If we could identify them the only option would be to landfill them,&quot; said one recycler who asked to remain anonymous. &quot;They are not wanted by UK recycling companies or local authorities who refuse to handle them. Councils are saying they do not want plastics near food collection. If these biodegradable [products] get into the recycling stream they contaminate it. &quot;It will get worse because the government is encouraging more recycling. There will be much more bioplastic around.&quot; Problems arise because some bioplastics are &quot;home&quot; compostable and recyclable. &quot;It&apos;s so confusing that a Pla bottle looks exactly the same as a standard Pet bottle,&quot; Skelton said. &quot;The consumer is not a polymer expert. Not nearly enough consideration has gone into what they are meant to do with them. Everything is just put in the recycling bin.&quot; Yesterday NatureWorks accepted that its products would not fully break down on landfill sites. &quot;The recycling industry in the UK has not caught up with other countries&quot; said Snehal Desai, chief marketing officer for NatureWorks. &quot;We need alternatives to oil.

In central Europe, Taiwan and elsewhere, NatureWorks polymer is widely accepted as a compostable material.&quot; Other users said it was too soon to judge the new technology. &quot;It&apos;s very early days,&quot; said Reed Paget, managing director of Belu. &quot;The UK packaging industry does not want competition.

That&apos;s all they see,&quot; said Chris Goodall, environmental analyst and author of How to Live a Low-carbon Lifestyle. &quot;I have been trying to compost bags that are billed as &apos;biodegradable&apos; and &apos;home compostable&apos; but I have completely failed. They rely on the compost heap really heating up but we still find the residues.&quot; Bioplastics compete for land with biofuels and food crops. About 200,000 tonnes of bioplastics were produced last year, requiring 250,000-350,000 tonnes of crops. The industry is forecast to need several million acres of farmland within four years.  There is also concern over the growing use by supermarkets of &quot;oxy-degradable&quot; plastic bags, billed as sustainable. They are made of conventional oil-based plastic, with an additive that enables the plastic to break down. The companies promoting it claim it reduces litter and causes no methane or harmful residues. They are used by Wal-Mart, Pizza Hut and KFC in the US, and Tesco and the Co-op in the UK for &quot;degradable&quot; plastic carrier bags.  Some environmentalists say the terminology confuses the public. &quot;The consumer is baffled,&quot; a Wrap briefing paper said. &quot;It considers these products degradable but ... they will not degrade effectively in [the closed environment of] a landfill site.&quot;  A spokesman for Symphony Plastics disputed that. &quot;Oxy-bioplastic can be re-used and recycled, but will degrade and disappear in a short timescale&quot;, he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/apr/26/top100flightfreeholidays.boatingholidays", "publicationDate": "2008-04-25T23:07:26Z", "tags": ["Top 100 flight free holidays", "Boating holidays", "Green travel", "Adventure travel", "Travel", "China holidays", "Cyprus holidays", "Sweden holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Montreal holidays", "Canada holidays", "Travel and transport", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Carbon footprints", "Ethical and green living", "Climate change", "Environment", "Transport", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Bookable through The Cruise People, the Evergreen Line sails from Thamesport to China via Suez, Singapore and Taiwan, while Euro-Med does a mammoth 35-day trek from Southampton around the Mediterranean, Ireland and Scandinavia."], "title": "Top 100 flight free holidays: Cargo ships", "article": "Slow boat to China Modern container ships might not be as glamorous as old-time clippers, junks and steamers, but they still ply those ports of legend: Shanghai, Singapore, Rio and Alexandria.

The tone is set by a revival of Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n&apos;s 1949 work, The Moor&apos;s Pavane, in which Shakespeare&apos;s Othello is pared down to a danced trio of love, jealousy and betrayal and set to music by Purcell. Also revived from the Lim\u00f3n archive is the male solo Chaconne, which creates a choreographic equivalent to the austere, beautiful lines of Bach&apos;s accompanying score. Two works by Javier De Frutos complement these Lim\u00f3n classics: Paseillo (pictured), a whispering, insinuatingly emotional piece exquisitely crafted to music by Mozart, and De Frutos&apos;s brand new Blue Roses, which is inspired by passages from Tennessee Williams&apos; The Glass Menagerie.

Fishing for tuna more than 200 nautical miles off Somalia&apos;s coast last weekend, they were surely out of the pirates&apos; range. But they had not reckoned with the &apos;mother ship&apos; lurking nearby. A hijacked trawler was now the pirates&apos; base; it was towing their high-powered speedboat. The Playa, with 26 crew, was easy pickings for an experienced militia armed with AK-47s and rocket-propelled grenades. For the second time in a fortnight Somali pirates had captured a European-registered and crewed ship, the most lucrative prize. The French luxury yacht Le Ponant, hijacked on 5 April with 30 crew on board, netted a $2m (\u00a31m) ransom, despite the close attention of France&apos;s military. Last night the Playa and its crew were safely heading for home waters, escorted by a Spanish frigate after negotiations between the pirates and the Spanish government, which refused to say whether an equally lucrative ransom had been paid. Vice-President Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega said the release had been achieved through &apos;co-operation and diplomacy&apos; between Spain, the ship&apos;s owners and representatives of the hijackers. The hijackings are confirmation, if any were needed, that the waters off Somalia are the most dangerous in the world. Last year, there were 31 attacks there, making the notorious bandits operating in the South China Sea and Malacca Straits look almost lazy by comparison. So far this year there have been 23 attacks by Somali pirates, including the 47-day hijacking of a new, British-captained icebreaker tug, the Svitzer Korsakov, on its way from Europe through the Gulf of Aden towards the gas fields in far eastern Russia. The ransom paid for its release was reported to be $1.6m. It is not only the frequency of the attacks off Somalia that has maritime experts deeply worried. It is the skill and daring of the pirates, some of whom call themselves &apos;marines&apos; and claim to be protecting the country&apos;s maritime resources from foreign exploitation. Until five years ago, captains were advised to stay at least 50 miles away from Somalia&apos;s coastline. A spate of hijackings led to a doubling of the safety zone. Now, the recommended safe distance is 200 miles, but the Playa attack shows even that is no guarantee of safety. With the large ransoms allowing the pirates to buy faster boats, and more sophisticated GPS systems, they can strike even in rough waters several hundred miles out to sea. The surge in attacks coincides with the worst unrest in Somalia since the early Nineties - the last time the country had a functioning government. Insurgents are battling Ethiopian troops who toppled an Islamist authority from power in December 2006. More than half the population of Mogadishu has since fled the city. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of President Abdullahi Yusuf, which is packed with former warlords, exercises little authority and claims to be unable to stop the piracy. But it is perhaps telling that during the six-month reign of the Somali Council of Islamic Courts over much of south and central Somalia in 2006, attacks on passing ships all but stopped. Andrew Mwangura, head of the Mombasa-based Seafarers&apos; Assistance Programme, and one of the foremost experts on Somali piracy, says there are five main pirate groups operating, sometimes together. &apos;Most of them are linked to warlords,&apos; he said. &apos;And the warlords are linked to the TFG, all the way to the top.&apos; Monitoring Somalia&apos;s 1,880-mile coastline, the longest in Africa, is no simple task. For several years a joint US-European naval unit has patrolled the region, which is on the trade route between the Mediterranean, east Africa and Asia, in an attempt to discourage attacks and keep an eye out for terrorists. But the bandits simply shifted their bases north to the semi-autonomous Puntland region. One-off military operations, such as the raid in Somalia&apos;s desert by French special forces to arrest six of the pirates who had attacked Le Ponant, are ineffective deterrents, say experts. Piracy is simply too profitable. A gunman on a pirate ship typically earns between $10,000 and $30,000 for a year&apos;s work - a fortune in Somalia. Those bankrolling the attacks from bases in the United Arab Emirates or Kenya, and sometimes as far afield as Canada, London or Hong Kong, can net several million dollars from a single strike, depending on the nationality of the shipowner, the origins and gender of the crew, the cargo and the age of the boat. &apos;Once the pirates&apos; bosses have the ship&apos;s name they immediately use the internet to research how much money they can make,&apos; said Mwangura. &apos;These guys really know what they are doing.&apos; Most owners pay up quickly, transferring money through a network of accounts in Nairobi, Mombasa and Dubai. The crews are seldom harmed. When older, less valuable trawlers - often from Taiwan or China - are captured, the demand is not cash but the temporary use of the boat. The owners promise not to report their vessel missing, and it becomes a temporary &apos;mother ship&apos;. In the past, pirates have attacked a cruise liner, as well as several cargo ships chartered by the UN World Food Programme containing food aid meant for Somalis. But as bizarre as it sounds, there is some truth in the pirates&apos; claim that they are acting as a coastguard. Under international law, a country&apos;s &apos;exclusive economic zone&apos; - where it has sole rights over marine and mineral resources - extends 200 nautical miles out to sea. Foreign ships are allowed to pass through these waters, but not to fish without a permit. Yet at any one time there are up to 500 foreign-registered boats fishing in Somalia&apos;s rich waters, according to the Seafarers&apos; Assistance Programme. European boats catch tuna or shrimp; vessels from the Far East catch sharks for their fins. Almost all are fishing illegally. Often, pirate attacks are not even reported to maritime authorities: the ransoms paid are regarded as legitimate fines, both by the pirates and the ship-owners. &apos;One way to stop the piracy is to stop the illegal fishing,&apos; said Mwangura. &apos;That way there will be nowhere for the pirates to hide.&apos; "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/apr/27/hasthetideturnedforgpsma", "publicationDate": "2008-04-27T11:51:07Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Gadgets", "Technology", "GPS"], "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s a signal the market is getting saturated.&quot;    The three leading suppliers, with 80% of the market, are TomTom, Garmin, and Taiwan&apos;s Mitac, which owns the Navman and Mio brands."], "title": "Has the tide turned for GPS makers?", "article": "Earnings at Netherlands-based TomTom NV have fallen by 83% in the first quarter. which &quot;suggests the market for stand-alone global-positioning systems is at a turning point,&quot; according to an AP report.  &quot;What we saw for the first time is that selling prices fell, but volumes didn&apos;t improve enough to compensate,&quot; analyst Eric de Graaf of Petercam said after the results were reported Wednesday. &quot;It&apos;s a signal the market is getting saturated.&quot;    The three leading suppliers, with 80% of the market, are TomTom, Garmin, and Taiwan&apos;s Mitac, which owns the Navman and Mio brands.

Georgia says a Russian MiG-29 shot it down. Russia&apos;s Nato envoy had suggested the alliance was responsible. &quot;The secretary general had said he&apos;d eat his tie if it turned out that a Nato Mig-29 had magically appeared in Abkhazia and shot down a Georgian drone,&quot; Nato spokesman James Appathurai said. He added: &quot;There is no danger of the secretary general getting ingestion.&quot; &quot;The steps taken (by Russia) ... and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have undermined Georgia&apos;s territorial integrity,&quot; he declared. On Tuesday Russia accused Georgia of plotting to attack Abkhazia, and announced that it was deploying additional troops and military equipment in the region. Around 1,000 Russian peacekeepers are already stationed in Abkhazia, which broke away from Georgia following a 1992-3 war. The move came after Russia&apos;s president, Vladimir Putin, this month recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia as legal entities - prompting a furious response from Tbilisi, which accused Russia of trying to annexe the territories by stealth. Georgia has denied it has plans to invade Abkhazia, a small and picturesque territory on the sub-tropical eastern coast of the Black Sea. Georgia&apos;s special presidential envoy, David Bakradze, has appealed for international solidarity, holding talks yesterday with the EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana. &quot;Georgia is being pushed to the edge of a precipice. Without credible and concerted reaction, we are confronted by the prospect of a situation similar to that in northern Cyprus or analogous to what occurred in Taiwan,&quot; Bakradze said.

It would thus strip it of the opportunity to earn Nato membership, while finally annexing Georgia&apos;s territories.&quot; Abkhazia&apos;s separatist leadership has echoed Russian claims that Georgia is massing forces in the Upper Kodori Valley - a strategic enclave controlled by Georgian forces but inside rebel-held territory.

Zou will be 27 later this month, stands just under 5ft 5in, and looks boyish enough to be a teenager, but wrinkles form beside his eyes when he smiles. The speck of a scar by his left eye is not from boxing but from a girl who once bullied him in school. He has sharp cheekbones, a thick brush of black hair, and a long, aquiline nose. His fighting weight is 48kg, and before each competition he spends most of a month famished. He gets grumpy and irritable, and then apologises. For distraction, he gnaws on watermelon slices and spits out the pulp. Or he pulls up pictures of lamb noodles and posts them on his blog. His team-mates were still outside, window-shopping, but Zou took a seat at an empty table. He laid out a Chinese newspaper and scanned the headlines, with little interest. The bridge of his nose was puffy and blue from his last bout, a few hours earlier. He was still in his red-and-white team warm-up suit with &apos;China&apos; embroidered in gold thread across the back. On his left breast he wore a small brass pin of Mao Zedong&apos;s head - a gift from his coach, Zhang Chuanliang, whom he calls Teacher Zhang. After eight days of competition, Zou&apos;s cheeks had hollowed, and his smile was tired. &apos;I&apos;m hungry,&apos; he said in Chinese. Zou could feast now. He had won his second world title earlier on that November day, confirming his place as the first boxer in Chinese history to be considered a contender for an Olympic gold medal. A few years ago, it was hard to imagine that a Chinese boxer could win anything. The sport was banned for decades, because Mao&apos;s government considered it too violent and too Western. It was not allowed until 1986, after sports authorities made a calculation: boxing has 11 weight classes, thereby providing dozens of medal opportunities. That means a lot to a government that has elevated the hunt for Olympic medals to a state religion, a faith never more fervent than today, as China prepares to host the 2008 Olympics, in Beijing. Chinese boxing officials have a name for their objective: the &apos;zero-gold-medal breakthrough&apos;. &apos;Our target for the 2008 Olympics is explicit: one gold medal,&apos; Chang Jianping, the president of the Chinese Boxing Association, told me. When the Beijing News asked Teacher Zhang, the team&apos;s head coach, what he thought of that prospect, he replied: &apos;The entire team has only one person really capable of capturing the gold - Zou Shiming.&apos; Zou&apos;s first fight in Chicago fell during lunchtime, and the crowd was sparse. Only muffled thuds and the polyglot shouts of opposing cornermen broke the stillness of the arena, at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Two rings had been erected side by side, so that simultaneous fights could speed up the opening rounds. The world outside had intruded already. The Cuban team, from which two fighters have defected in recent years, were boycotting the competition, saying that they suspected a conspiracy by the &apos;most vile interests of the United States and some of its allies: the theft of athletes&apos;. Separately, two Ugandan fighters, including the team captain, had vanished from their hotel with their suitcases. One later called the coach to say, with apologies, that he was in Canada, but made no mention of returning home. Zou walked silently to the ring. The announcer stumbled over his name (&apos;Sheeming Joe!&apos;), to a polite flutter of applause. Zou slipped through the ropes. In his corner, in a hooded sweatshirt, stood Teacher Zhang, who looked so unprepossessing that he might have been a spectator who had stepped up for a closer look. Zhang coached martial arts until 1986, when he switched to boxing. At 54, he is trim and good-looking, with a brush cut that, like many Chinese men his age, he dyes an inky black. He has little appetite for conversation, but if he is asked about fighting his eyes sparkle and he embarks on long, precise paragraphs. He has done more than anybody else to define China&apos;s boxing style, yet he is so averse to attention that he can sometimes be found napping in the locker room during medal ceremonies while his fighters are on the podium. Zhang&apos;s indifference to formality is unusual, to say the least, in China&apos;s sports bureaucracy. &apos;The leaders don&apos;t like him,&apos; a coach who has known him for many years says. &apos;He has never kissed the leaders&apos; arses.&apos; A trio of Chinese sports officials had filed in and taken ringside seats. Zou turned toward Zhang and embraced him for a long moment over the top rope, his glove curled around the older man&apos;s head. After more than a decade with Teacher Zhang, Zou mentions him more often than he does his parents. &apos;We&apos;re like father and son,&apos; Zou says. The hug is a pre-fight ritual. &apos;It calms me down.&apos; Zou turned back to his opponent, Constantin Paraschiv. At the bell, the Romanian came out in a hurry, his fists clamped beside his face. He was energetic and aggressive, firing jabs and prompting Zou to backpedal or list from the waist. Zou looked uninspired. He threw few punches. He drifted around the ring, pursued by the Romanian. As they went back to their corners at the end of the first round, Paraschiv led, three points to two. Teacher Zhang stood close to Zou&apos;s face, spoke softly, and tipped a trickle of bottled water into his mouth. When the bell rang, Zou sprang forward and buried a left-right combination to even the score. He set his stance farther apart than before and bounced lightly on the balls of his feet. He scissored his legs, a homage to his idol, Muhammad Ali. His first round, it seemed, had been a warm-up. He glided around Paraschiv, pausing only to flick a combination into the Romanian&apos;s padded brow. Every time Paraschiv swung his fist, Zou eased out of the way and counterpunched. Paraschiv, pivoting and swinging in vain, did not score another point in the round. Or, for that matter, in either of the two rounds that followed. Zou rarely knocks opponents out. He batters them and darts out of reach, like an angry sparrow. Sometimes he holds his fists so low that they drop below his waist, a caricature of Ali. Zou fights at light-flyweight, the lightest Olympic class. But, even among boxers his size, Zou is known for exceptional speed. After he beat Paddy Barnes, I asked the Irishman what had happened. Zou&apos;s left hand, he replied. &apos;It&apos;s that fast. I could hardly see it coming.&apos; When the American Rau&apos;Shee Warren was on his way to losing to Zou in the 2004 Olympics, in Athens, Warren told his corner that he could not keep up: &apos;I&apos;m telling the coach, &quot;Dang, he can move, and I can&apos;t catch him!&quot;&apos; By the final bell, Zou had scored 13 punches on Paraschiv in a row, to win 15-3. The Romanian was flushed and slumped. He had spent three rounds slugging air. After the referee held Zou&apos;s arm aloft, Zou bowed to the judges and ducked through the ropes. He climbed down from the ring and headed for the front row, where the officials were seated. China&apos;s boxing boss, Chang, a jolly, broad-faced man in a maroon blazer, sat with provincial sports officials. Zou greeted each with a two-handed shake, nodded at their comments, and thanked them. I came to recognise the ritual after every one of his fights: the beeline to the officials at ringside, the two-handed shakes. Sweat pouring down his face, Zou listened closely to the men in suit jackets. Sports officials in China are among those who have a hand in shaping an athlete&apos;s future: where he lives, the terms by which he goes pro. On the evening news, they march in hard hats around new stadiums or huddle over blueprints. I wondered what they could possibly tell Zou about his fight that he did not know already. Zou&apos;s emergence startled American boxing purists, who have been slow to warm to his style. After Zou&apos;s fight, I asked the United States&apos; head coach, Dan Campbell, what he thought. &apos;I didn&apos;t think anything of him,&apos; Campbell said. &apos;He did the thing that he did in the Olympics, hitting with this part of his hand, and this part,&apos; Campbell went on, gesturing dismissively to the sides of his fist. That criticism does not bother Teacher Zhang. Zou&apos;s medals are the evidence he needs. &apos;If he can win points,&apos; Zhang said, &apos;even if he can fight with you he won&apos;t waste his energy.&apos; Zou was born on 18 May 1981 in the mountain city  of Zunyi, in Guizhou, one of China&apos;s poorest provinces. His parents lived and worked in a factory district that produced defence equipment under the ministry of aerospace. His father, Zou Jianguo (his given name means &apos;build the nation&apos;), was an engineer. He was gentle and remote, and worked relentlessly. Now in his fifties, Zou Jianguo is slender, with a ripple of tidy black hair. At one point, he considered joining the Communist Party. &apos;I tried, but I did not meet the Party&apos;s standard,&apos; he said. &apos;I always tried. I always tried.&apos; Zou&apos;s mother was as outgoing as her husband was reserved. She was a kindergarten teacher in the factory school. She excelled at table tennis; he preferred basketball. Their son, an only child, was small for his age, and they kept him close to home. When I met her in Zunyi and asked about Zou&apos;s upbringing, she laughed. &apos;When he was little, he looked like a little girl, with his head of curly hair,&apos; she said. &apos;My mother raised me too much like a girl,&apos; Zou told me. &apos;I couldn&apos;t talk too loud. I couldn&apos;t run or play around like other boys. Characteristics that should come out didn&apos;t come out. I didn&apos;t like to talk to people, maybe because my spirit was suppressed.&apos; As he grew up, Zou discovered television martial-arts dramas about fabled swordsmen. One of his favourite heroes was Zhang Sanfeng, a Taoist mystic of the 13th or 14th century, who is considered the father of Tai Chi. Legend describes him as seven-feet tall, with immense eyes and ears, and a fondness for clothes made of leaves. When Zou was 12 his parents enrolled him in a private school to study wushu, a modern hybrid sport based on traditional martial arts. They expected him to end up as a physical-education teacher with a stable job and a pension. But Zou was bored by wushu, which he thought emphasised form over fighting. He was attracted to boxing, which seemed explosive and free. When Zou asked his mother if he could switch to boxing, she thought the idea was preposterous. &apos;You are too delicate,&apos; she recalls saying. &apos;How can you train as a boxer?&apos; And she added: &apos;If you don&apos;t want your mum to sleep at night, then go box.&apos; Zou told his parents that he would stick to martial arts, but he began training with the school boxing team. &apos;I fell madly in love with boxing,&apos; he said. &apos;In the ring, I could truly let myself go. I wasn&apos;t subject to my mother&apos;s or anyone else&apos;s control.&apos; In 1995, Zou transferred to the Zunyi Sport School, one of China&apos;s Soviet-style sports institutes. One July day, he showed up with 1,900 other children to try out for the school&apos;s athletic teams. The boxing team had only four spots. First, the young athletes faced the measuring tape. Chinese coaches put extraordinary faith in assessing a child&apos;s dimensions, sometimes with the help of X-rays, to deduce athletic potential. It was the system that identified the basketball star Yao Ming when he was a child. Boxing coaches were interested only in athletes with a long reach - that is, children whose wingspan exceeded their height by three centimetres. Zou&apos;s outstretched arms measured a full centimetre less than his height, and the coaches discarded him in the first round. Two weeks later, Zou showed up again, and stood with the other applicants. &apos;I thought, &quot;This kid&apos;s clever and he&apos;s willing to suffer,&quot;&apos; Liang Feng, the coach who was running the try-outs, told me. Coach Liang put gloves on the boy and sent him in for a round. It was an unremarkable debut. &apos;He was frightened, timid,&apos; Liang said. But Zou&apos;s martial-arts training had given him good footwork, and he seemed to have a natural sense of distance, knowing how to lunge and withdraw to stay just out of his opponent&apos;s reach. He was nimble and willing to train harder than the other rookies. &apos;He was like a machine, just running without stopping,&apos; Liang said. The coach took a chance and put Zou on the team; a year later, in his first big tournament, he made it to the finals against a strong competitor. And then he buckled. &apos;The whole fight, he ran around,&apos; Liang said. &apos;He didn&apos;t dare to fight.&apos; Still, Liang was not ready to give up, believing that fear could be a form of protection. Besides, Zou was at the gym all day, every day, except for a few hours on Sunday. When nobody else showed up on the eve of Chinese New Year, he trained alone. When the arena was locked for the holiday, he and a friend jumped a fence to run on the track until a security guard chased them away. Coach Liang recommended him for the provincial team, and failed to mention his arm measurements. &apos;If I didn&apos;t hide that, it would be over,&apos; Liang said. Zou&apos;s parents continued to disapprove of his boxing, and demanded that he stop. A coach paid them a visit at home. He emphasised the safety of the headgear that is designed to protect amateur boxers against injuries. He argued that Olympic boxing is not like the heavyweight prizefights on television. Whereas professionals pound each other in search of a knockout blow, Olympic boxers win most often on points, relying on speed and accuracy to land the most punches during four two-minute rounds. The coach also mentioned that his own son was boxing, which Zou&apos;s mother found reassuring. &apos;He told us that in strong boxing countries, like the United States and Cuba, children from the age of two or three can go to the boxing gym to train,&apos; she said. &apos;It&apos;s like ping-pong in China.&apos; Zou&apos;s parents had no reason to be familiar with the sport. Western boxing, as it was known, had first appeared in China in the 1920s, in the port cities of Shanghai and Guangzhou, where foreign sailors were pitted against local fighters. The sport grew, unsupervised. In 1953, at a big competition in the northern city of Tianjin, a boxer died after a bout. Sports authorities were unnerved and in 1959, as China organised its first national games, it dropped boxing from the line-up. Mao was driving his nation deeper into isolation: the Great Leap Forward, his disastrous push for an industrial breakthrough, was already heading towards a famine that killed more than 30 million people. The political atmosphere was increasingly hostile to Western imports. As Fan Hong, a scholar who specialises in China&apos;s athletic history, puts it: &apos;People believed that boxing was very brutal, very ruthless, and those were said to be the characteristics of capitalism. So it was banned.&apos; When the Cultural Revolution engulfed China, in 1966, the Communist Party banned competitive sports and athletes who had won medals in the past found themselves accused of jinbiao zhuyi, or &apos;trophy mania&apos;, a charge of pursuing victory more zealously than Mao&apos;s vision of mass fitness. The table tennis champion Rong Guotuan, who had been greeted with parades a few years earlier, was detained on a trumped-up charge of spying and later hanged himself. Before his death, he wrote: &apos;I love my reputation more than my life.&apos; After the Cultural Revolution subsided, in 1969, China used table tennis to reconnect with the world, sometimes throwing matches to promote a friendlier mood. It was not until the late 1970s that Deng Xiaoping decided that competition might be as good for athletics as it was for the economy. In December 1979, Deng invited Muhammad Ali to the heavily guarded compound housing China&apos;s top leaders. The champ hugged him. They sat. And the word went out. &apos;Now the message was: &quot;If we want to win friends, if we want to win respect, we have to win medals&quot;,&apos; Fan said. In the following decade, Chinese boxers began training again, after a fashion. &apos;We had no bag or gloves,&apos; Liu Gang, one of the earliest recruits and now a promoter, said. &apos;In three months, I wore out two pairs of white cotton shoes. We punched sandbags.&apos; Liu went on to the 1992 Olympics, in Barcelona, where competitors were delighted to be drawn against Chinese opponents. The best that their coaches hoped for was that each fighter might stay on his feet a bit longer than the one before him. Today, as China transforms itself for the Olympics, Beijing is determined to broadcast a picture of prosperity. It is overhauling parts of the city that had not changed much since the 13th century, razing miles of one-storey brick alleys that Mongol conquerors designed to uniform widths of 12 or 24 paces. It is building a new world of vertical apartment complexes, with foreign names such as the Greenwich and the Upper East Side. Underground, a web of subway lines has more than doubled in length in barely six years. Olympic guests will step through an airport terminal that will be the largest in the world. In this atmosphere, any feat of preparation seems plausible. One Chinese pork supplier vowed to produce specially pampered pigs, to ensure that hormone-fed meat would not cause athletes to give false positives in doping tests. Only after Chinese citizens began wondering about their own pork did a Beijing Olympic Committee spokesperson issue a &apos;Clarification on Olympic Pig-Related Reports&apos;, denouncing the pork story as an &apos;exaggerated falsehood&apos;. In the Games proper, China hopes to win more gold than ever before. At the founding of the People&apos;s Republic, in 1949, no Chinese athlete had ever stood on an Olympic podium; by the close of the 2004 Summer Games, in Athens, China trailed only the United States, 32 to 36, in that year&apos;s gold medals. Chinese sports officials scrutinise, dissect, and forecast the medal race with an intensity that lends it the air of science - convinced that sufficient analysis will eventually engineer away the frailty of a diver in mid-air or a fighter in the ring. In 2000, Chinese officials launched the Project 119, a campaign to win more gold medals in the Summer Games&apos; most competitive events - a list that by China&apos;s calculation totalled 119 medals. In Athens, China&apos;s gold tally reflected its focus on producing an elite cadre of championship-level performers. Most Olympic delegations return home with more bronzes and silvers than golds. Out of the top 15 nations in the medal table at Athens, only China had more golds than bronze and silver combined - albeit by the margin of 32 to 31. China now cultivates sports that it never cared about before, events that (like boxing) increase a medal count because they include various weight classes or categories. Chinese athletes and coaches have also begun to defy their long-held belief that they can never best larger, taller Western competitors. And doing so is particularly glorious, as the sprinter Liu Xiang indicated after he won a gold medal in the 110metres hurdles in Athens. &apos;I believe I achieved a modest miracle for the yellow-skinned Chinese people and the Asian people,&apos; he said afterwards. The elite athletes who bear the responsibility for realising the country&apos;s ambitions live in privileged isolation. Their talents are treated as public goods, but while they are practising they live in secluded sports complexes, where they eat, sleep, and train under coaches&apos; instructions. If national-team members have commercial endorsements, they are required to share the money with their team staff and the state. When the Olympic diving champion Guo Jingjing was criticised, two years ago, for having too many &apos;commercial activities&apos;, she appeared on state television to apologise. &apos;I belong to the country,&apos; she said. As a boxer, Zou is even more cloistered, because his sport sanctifies monastic training. At times, coaches confiscate his mobile phones to eliminate distractions. Soon after Zou made his provincial team, in 1996, Teacher Zhang began to notice his extraordinary work ethic. Zhang had set out to develop a distinct Chinese style of boxing. He was studying fighters from Cuba, Russia, and the US. &apos;Asian people have different abilities and body types than Americans or Europeans,&apos; Zhang told me last autumn. &apos;We have to fight with flexibility and fight with speed. Because, after all, you don&apos;t often win by knocking people out. Fight with your mind. Fight with strategy.&apos; In 2003, Zou won his first national championship and drew political recognition; he was named one of the 10 outstanding young persons in Guizhou province and, later, a national advanced worker. Like other national champions, he joined the Communist Party. Chinese reporters nicknamed him the Dark Horse at first. Later, they tried the Knight of Lightning or the Fox or, sometimes, the Pirate, all celebrating his knack for snatching points and peeling away from his opponents&apos; reach. That strategy was helping him win international matches. In Athens, Zou made it to the semi-finals, so winning a bronze, China&apos;s first medal in boxing. He captured headlines, but when he returned home his achievement paled against the frenzy over Liu Xiang&apos;s gold in the hurdles. Zou&apos;s loss in the semis began to feel like a failure. &apos;Making a mistake in an event as grand as the Olympics, and to come so close to a gold medal, is a feeling that is inscribed into your bones and printed on your heart,&apos; he told me. It was another year before Zou won his first gold medal, at the 2005 world championships, held in the western Chinese city of Mianyang. He was the nation&apos;s first amateur boxing champion, and China celebrated. For him, the lesson was unmistakable: &apos;You must win the championship in order to get acknowledgment.&apos; The following year, Zou started a blog where he posted his diary entries and photographs. Entering the site triggers a twinkling piano tune, the first in a long loop of his favourite songs. A few hours after he posted his first message, a fan wrote: &apos;You are the pride of the Chinese people!&apos; Some days, Zou writes about fighting (&apos;I&apos;m fully confident that in tomorrow&apos;s combat I cannot fail!&apos;). On others, he posts a picture of himself strolling on a beach or flying a kite. He writes of his struggles: &apos;Often, when I sleep, my legs don&apos;t know where to go. No matter how I lie, I can&apos;t sleep comfortably. Worst of all, in a flash, the whistle blows and it&apos;s time to get out of bed again to train.&apos;  After midnight one night in the winter of 2006, he wrote: &apos;This week&apos;s training has been really tough, and the added intensity is bringing out accumulated years&apos; worth of pain, to the point that my back hurts so much it is keeping me awake.&apos; It was a week before the Chinese New Year, the most important family holiday, and he was spending it, once again, at a training centre far from home. &apos;The thought of the pain and homesickness troubles my mind. It&apos;s late at night, I&apos;m still unable to sleep, and I really want to find a good friend to chat with, but I feel bad to bother them. So I&apos;ll just pour out my heart to everyone, and hope people encourage me to shake off this spell of being down!&apos; He received five comments immediately. Someone using the name A Secret Supporter wrote: &apos;I, too, am far from home, and I know what you are experiencing.&apos; Zou won the Chicago championship with ease. In his final match, he routed a Filipino, 17-3. Even Dan Campbell, the American coach, said that he was impressed. After the national anthems, Zou wandered through the halls of the arena but drew little attention from the American fans streaming past. China&apos;s state news service once ranked him number four on the list of the nation&apos;s top athletes, three places behind Yao Ming, but outside China Zou remains virtually unknown. In addition to Zou&apos;s gold medal, China had won four bronzes, its best finish ever. When the team returned to Beijing, after an all-night flight, Chinese reporters were waiting for Zou in the terminal. They gave him bouquets of flowers and launched an impromptu press conference around his luggage cart. The next morning&apos;s Beijing News carried a story about his return, headlined with a quote: &apos;We Told the World with Our Fists That China Is Strong.&apos; If Zou&apos;s home town were in the United States, its seven million people would make it America&apos;s second-largest city, but Zunyi doesn&apos;t have an airport, so when teams from China, Kazakhstan, and the United States arrived in late November for a friendly competition they landed in Chongqing, a three-hour flight from Beijing. From there, they took a three-hour bus ride through mountain tunnels and gullies, around terraced fields, and into the clanging centre of Zunyi. Zou&apos;s picture was on the front page of the Zunyi Evening News, on cardboard cutouts beside restaurants that serve bumblebee larvae, a local delicacy. The fa\u00e7ade of the Fuyuan Hotel was plastered with two huge posters of Zou in the ring. In English and Chinese, they said: &apos;Welcome to the Return of the King from Victory.&apos; It was Zou&apos;s first competition here in years, and the event was to last three days. His face was printed on the tickets. His first opponent was a Kazakh. The match was lopsided and brief; midway through the second round, Zou was pummelling the hapless man, 20-0, when the referee stopped the fight. Zou waved to the audience and jogged back to the sanctuary of his locker room. Fights were still under way, but a frenzied crowd of kids began to mass outside the locker-room door, which was guarded by police, except for the police who wandered inside to ask Zou for his autograph. &apos;Get changed!&apos; Teacher Zhang murmured. &apos;If you wait until the end, it will be hard to leave. This is a small town.&apos; The door opened a crack, revealing a wall of young, reddened faces pressed against a policeman&apos;s outstretched arm. The door slammed shut. Zou stepped out of his trunks and pulled on jeans and a Brazil soccer jersey. The room smelled of sweat and garlic. From the sound of it, the crowd outside was growing. He looked at his coach. They were, for the moment, trapped. Well-wishers had left giant bouquets of flowers on the table in the locker room, so Zou grabbed two of them and held them in front of his face as a shield. And then he and his coach pressed into the maw of the crowd. Teenagers swarmed, jostling and shouting. Zou smiled and thanked them, but pushed forward. By the time he had squeezed into the stairwell and down to a waiting bus, the bouquets were shredded. The next day, Zou and his parents visited relatives in town. They climbed the steps to a modest two-bedroom apartment where the entry hall was filled with a large, empty fish tank and a folded treadmill. The apartment was decorated, more or less, with Zou: a wall poster of his face beneath the phrase &apos;Everything for 2008&apos;; a poem written in calligraphy by another relative, which ended: &apos;Surprise the whole world in year 2008.&apos; Looking at it, I wondered how they would redecorate once the Olympics were over. As we walked to lunch that day, I asked Zou if his body was holding up. His back and his foot have been bothering him for months. (He had told a Chinese reporter: &apos;After endurance runs, I lie on the ground, and I can&apos;t tell the tears from the sweat.&apos;) &apos;It&apos;s painful,&apos; he said. &apos;But there&apos;s no time for surgery before the Olympics. That will have to wait.&apos; I once asked him how it felt to live his life suspended between future success and failure. &apos;I absolutely can&apos;t allow such a heavy burden to feel like it&apos;s suffocating me, or I will bring those worries into the ring,&apos; he said. The following night, in the final, Zou faced Luis Yanez, a confident, experienced 19-year-old from Duncanville, Texas, who had won a succession of amateur titles on his way to the American Olympic team. After years of hearing about Zou, he had a strategy: &apos;He drops his hands a lot and holds his hands down, and I got a quick jab, so if I just keep my jab out there in his face he won&apos;t have them down there no more,&apos; Yanez told me. &apos;But he&apos;s a good little fighter. He&apos;s slick.&apos; The arena holds about 5,000 people, and that night it was packed. The walls did not meet the roof, and it was cold inside; the ring-card girls huddled in parkas during the rounds. The city had made special preparations for its foreign guests: officials were identified with signs intended to be bilingual. A Chinese sign indicated the &apos;Arbitrator&apos;s Seat&apos;. The English letters below read &apos;Arditrator eat&apos;. Not that the American team was unaccustomed to communication trouble; team members had spent part of the day at a pharmacy trying to mime the symptoms of a stomach ailment. Zou jogged out of the locker room draped in a golden robe, his face hidden beneath the hood. Only his gloves were visible, firing jabs into the cool night air. High over his head, a banner along the rafters ran the length of the stadium wall, with an enormous picture of him in mid-fight. When the announcer said his name, the crowd went berserk. On the upper deck, a man unfurled a red Chinese flag as big as a bedsheet, and Zou&apos;s cardboard blown-up face danced in the crowd. Teacher Zhang had warned him before the fight not to let the attention affect him. &apos;Don&apos;t try to prove anything or show off,&apos; Zhang said. &apos;Be yourself, and you&apos;ll be fine.&apos; Yanez came out with no robe, jogging and sidestepping toward the ring, flicking his gloves over his shoulders as if trying to shoo away an insect. He climbed through the ropes, jogged in place, and settled into a half-crouch to wait for the bell. The two surged into each other. They wrestled and bear-hugged, tying each other up in headlocks. The referee pulled them apart, and Zou buried a combination into Yanez&apos;s head. The crowd loved it. Yanez responded with a broad hook that missed by a foot. Zou settled into a rhythm, and his fists dropped to his waist, his gloves rolling loosely up and down, as if he were a timpani player, rising only to peck at Yanez&apos;s temples. Yanez grew frustrated. He lunged, angrily, but landed few punches. When the first round ended, Zou led, 8-1. He turned back to his corner. He waved away his stool and stood facing into the ring, his arms splayed comfortably on the top rope. He looked at home there. It occurred to me that he has been boxing almost half his life. The second round drifted farther out of Yanez&apos;s grasp. Zou racked up points, setting his feet to hit hard now, intent on landing a big punch. He held his hands so low that they dropped behind his back, pleading with Yanez to open himself up. As the third round ticked down, Yanez was frantic, swinging broad hooks through the air. He looked, suddenly, like a child. Zou stretched his lead to 19 points. The bell sounded. With his chest heaving, Yanez plodded back to his corner, but the American coach was already nodding to the referee. Zou thrust his fists into the air. The audience erupted and began pouring towards the ring. The fighters shook hands and Yanez slipped away, unnoticed. Zou put on his golden robe, brilliant in the ring lights, and stood alone, arms raised in the centre of the canvas. He turned and faced the crowd of his countrymen, hundreds of them pressed against the edge of the ring, mobile phones aloft, snapping pictures. Zou seemed at peace with the knowledge that his country&apos;s self-regard hinges on a single fight in his future, on a single medal. He has come of age in China&apos;s system and, if it chafes him, he does not readily admit to it. Like the pressure born of his talent, his role as a political symbol seemed to be something he accepted long ago, something larger than he is. The 10 best Chinese athletes 1 Liu Xiang (Athletics) The world and Olympic 110m hurdles champion broke Colin Jackson&apos;s 13-year-old world record in 2006. Aged 24, he should be reaching his peak. 2 Yang Wei (Gymnastics) Yang fell off the high bar in Athens in 2004, ruining his chance of gold, but in 2007 became the first all-round world champion to defend his title in 81 years.  3 Shen Xue &amp;Amp; Zhao Hongbo (Figure skating) Shen and her partner Zhao won gold at the Asian Games and the world championships last year, then announced their engagement. 4 Zhu Qinan (Shooting) Broke the world record to win gold in the 10m air rifle at Athens aged 19 and, after smashing it again in October last year, he will be favourite to retain his title. 5 Guo Jingjing (Diving) A gossip-magazine staple with a string of high-profile boyfriends, Guo, 26, won double gold in Athens and will bid for a repeat in Beijing before retiring. 6  Zhang Guozheng (Weightlifting) The reigning world champion will be defending his 69kg Olympic crown in Beijing. 7 Zhu Lin (Badminton) With China aiming for a clean sweep of the badminton medals, even 24-year-old world singles champion Zhu will have to see off tough competition to qualify for the three-strong team. 8 Zou Shiming (Boxing) The light-flyweight is China&apos;s first genuine Olympic boxing contender. The Athens bronze medallist successfully defended his amateur world title in Chicago last year. 9 Wu Peng (Swimming) The man most likely to deny Michael Phelps a seven-gold Beijing haul. He is on a $25,000 bonus if he pips the American to victory in the 200m butterfly. 10 Guo Yue (Table tennis) The 19-year-old world champion is a household name in China, and even her press conferences are broadcast live on state television. China expects Never mind the taking part, for China it&apos;s all about the winning. Since they rejoined the Olympic family in 1984, having previously boycotted the Games in protest at Taiwan&apos;s participation, their progress has been extraordinary - China have gone from nought to 60 medals in just six Olympics. The remarkable aspect of China&apos;s rise has been the proportion of golds: in Athens, they constituted more than half of their total, putting them second in the medal table. This time, no medal avenue is being overlooked.  In 2000 the authorities launched Project 119, a scheme aimed at challenging for gold in some of the most medal-rich sports: athletics, swimming and water sports. Chinese officials will be quietly confident of overhauling the USA, but even they probably have no idea how high they can go. We reckon 43 golds, 11 up from Athens, is a fair estimate, based on linear performance trends, and the effect of home advantage; then again, we really have no idea either.Jonathan Liew"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/04/globaleconomy.economics", "publicationDate": "2008-05-04T16:41:23Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "Economics", "Business", "China", "India", "US news", "Investing", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["America&apos;s relations with the Chinese are more strained as a result of tension over Tibet and Taiwan, not to mention the obvious ideological political divide."], "title": "Tiger economies are snapping at US heels", "article": "China and India and are moving toward becoming the biggest economies in the world: with 2.4bn people, or 40 per cent of the world&apos;s population and annual GDP growth rates of between 8 per cent and 10 per cent, experts say that they could one day overtake the US.

Economically, China has had a head start. Bill Emmott, former editor of the Economist, says in his book &apos;Rivals&apos; that India&apos;s time has yet to come; to date it has been constrained by a poor infrastructure, social divisions, a caste system and mind-boggling poverty. But it is fast making up for lost time and no doubt Emmott wouldn&apos;t disagree with Steven Roach at US investment bank Morgan Stanley that &apos;India is on the cusp of something big&apos;. Bottelier says the challenges the countries face are quite distinct. &apos;Generally, China has gone much further than India in trade liberalisation and in opening to foreign investment.&apos; But he says things are starting to change.  Bottelier adds: &apos;Issues facing India are much more broad-based, such as improvement in infrastructure and facilities, effective administration and labour reforms. Minus points for China include a lack of good quality software, a low proportion of Chinese who speak English and a less mature outsourcing industry.&apos; India is hamstrung by bureaucracy: &apos;When the Chinese say they are going to do something, they get on with it and you can see the results much more quickly than in India where red tape is everywhere,&apos; says one analyst. On the other hand, the huge increase in trade between the two nations has fuelled talk of the &apos;Chindia&apos; effect. In 2006, trade between India and China reached $18.4bn. However, there is still mutual distrust. India remains suspicious of China&apos;s relationship with arch-rival Pakistan, while China is concerned about New Delhi&apos;s growing ties with Washington, especially their nuclear agreement allowing India access to civilian nuclear technology.  Observers expect the US to deepen its ties with India, which Washington views as a counterweight to China. America&apos;s relations with the Chinese are more strained as a result of tension over Tibet and Taiwan, not to mention the obvious ideological political divide. But that hasn&apos;t stopped US companies investing heavily in China, more so than British ones which have been quicker to spot opportunities in India, perhaps because of their historic affinity. But these days investors tend to get more excited about India than China. True, a superficial look would argue in China&apos;s favour: its world class infrastructure, gleaming skyscrapers, huge supply of cheap labour and ability to direct resources anywhere they are needed. However, a report from Bloomberg says: &apos;For all the stories about China churning out millions of engineers and scientists, innovation isn&apos;t at the heart of the economy. Foreign investment and massive government spending, not ideas or start-ups, lie behind China&apos;s boom.&apos; There is a dearth of internationally known Chinese companies that operate on a global scale and market their products abroad. In contrast, India has fostered globally known and competitive firms like Infosys and Reliance Industries, and has done a better job protecting intellectual property rights. China may get more headlines, yet the steady increase of Indian billionaires (Lakshmi Mittal, to name but one) is a reminder that India&apos;s markets are more developed. The demographics also favour India which has younger population.  A report by Deutsche Bank cites surveys indicating that India has better corporate governance standards and its companies are more commercially driven. The bank adds: &apos;Although India started economic reforms a decade later than China, it is far more advanced in its institutional and financial infrastructure. This is reflected in contrasting outcomes: foreign direct investment is considerably lower than in China, but returns on investment are better on average.&apos; A new measure of world economies, published by the International Monetary Fund, indicates that China and India are closing the gap on America. In a measure of purchasing power parity, adjusted to take account of exchange rates, the US is ranked at the top with $13 trillion, China is a close second at nearly $10 trillion, while India is fourth with $4.2 trillion, behind Japan.  The Indian academic Jagdish Sheth expects China to become the world&apos;s biggest economy by 2020, and India to overtake Japan to become the third biggest in just two years&apos; time. That sets the stage for the next leg of the race between China and India in what promises to be one of the most dramatic developments of the 21st century."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/06/china.catholicism", "publicationDate": "2008-05-05T23:00:17Z", "tags": ["China", "Catholicism", "Religion", "Classical music", "World news", "Music", "Culture", "Christianity", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["But stumbling blocks include China&apos;s birth control laws and Rome&apos;s recognition of Taiwan - rapprochement is likely to be slow."], "title": "China employs sing-song diplomacy", "article": "It may sound more highbrow than ping-pong diplomacy, but China hopes that an orchestral performance at the Vatican tomorrow will be as effective in thawing frosty relations.  Diplomatic ties between the Catholic church and Beijing were severed shortly after the Communists took power in 1949 and Catholics in China had to worship underground.  But last year Pope Benedict XVI issued a 55-page open letter saying he wanted to restore full diplomatic links. Shortly afterwards, the Vatican approved the installation of a new state-approved Catholic bishop in the Chinese capital. Now Beijing has arranged for the China Philharmonic Orchestra to play at the Vatican, in an offer that the conductor, Yu Long, compared to the table tennis matches played by US players in China in 1971 which helped revive Sino-American relations.  &quot;If music as a universal language can make a contribution to diplomacy or world peace, I will be very happy,&quot; he said, adding that there were parallels with the New York Philharmonic&apos;s ice-breaking concert in North Korea in February. Both Beijing and the papacy hope that Mozart&apos;s Requiem and Chinese folk songs can also help bridge the divide.

The nationwide tally leapt to 11,905 today after the government ordered all local health officials to notify it of cases. More than half are in Fuyang City, in eastern Anhui province, where 22 of the victims died after becoming infected with Enterovirus 71. The virus has caused sporadic outbreaks of the disease in the Asia-Pacific region since 1997. Hand, foot and mouth does not normally kill children, but in its severest forms can lead to complications including heart and respiratory problems and meningitis. It is most easily spread through contact with infected blisters or faeces. The Beijing News reported today that the city has had 1,482 cases of hand, foot and mouth. It is not yet clear if they involved the EV71 strain or another virus. Staff at a children&apos;s hospital told the Guardian they were treating &quot;many&quot; cases of the disease, but declined to give further details. One mother said she would avoid taking her child to crowded places such asmarkets and parks and would disinfect his bottles daily. But Belle Zhao, whose son is eight months old, added: &quot;They think it&apos;s not as frightening as Sars [the disease which killed almost 350 people in Chinain 2002-3].&quot; The city&apos;s Centre for Disease Control has advised that infected children should be isolated at home, and that any class with more than three infected children should be suspended. Today the state news agency Xinhua reported that authorities in Anhui had punished 10 doctors and officials for mishandling the outbreak. Two doctors were criticised for delaying moving a patient to a larger hospital, while others were fined for illegally injecting immune globulin into children, claiming it could prevent EV71 - for which there is no vaccine. Five county-level officials were reprimanded for failing to inform the public of the problem. The official media has attacked the authorities in Anhui for not announcing the outbreak until weeks after it began. This week the World Health Organisation said the delay was caused by the difficulty of diagnosing the disease, as many victims did not have the usual symptoms. The fatality rate has dropped dramatically, but the rapid spread of the illness is still causing concern and experts believe numbers will not peak until later this month or even next, when the disease is normally at its height. &quot;The fact that the current outbreak in China continues, with so many cases and deaths, is worrying,&quot; said Professor Tom Solomon of Liverpool University, who is researching EV71 outbreaks in Asia. He said it was unclear why some patients died, but that it probably related to the severity of the virus as well as their immune response and how late they arrived at hospital. Solomon said the virus was not a major problem when it was first recognizedin California in the 1960s. He added: &quot;In 1997 the virus caused a large unexpected outbreak of hand,foot and mouth disease in Sarawak, with many fatalities. Since then thevirus has plagued the Asia-Pacific region with outbreaks most years. Anoutbreak in Taiwan in 1998 was estimated to affect 1.5 million people. &quot;We don&apos;t know why the virus has suddenly started causing these outbreaks,or whether they will spread beyond Asia. It probably relates to the virus&apos;sfast rate of evolution, and the emergence of new genetic subtypes.&quot; \u0095 Additional research by Alice Xin-Liu"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/may/06/china", "publicationDate": "2008-05-06T13:44:51Z", "tags": ["China", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["References to other sensitive subjects, such as human rights, Taiwan and Tokyo&apos;s bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council, are still being negotiated, they said."], "title": "Chinese president makes historic trip to Japan", "article": "East Asia&apos;s biggest rivals were today preparing to welcome a &quot;warm spring&quot; to replace the bitter winter chill that has long cut through their relationship, as Hu Jintao arrived in Tokyo on the first visit to Japan by a Chinese president for a decade. Though his arrival was greeted by an unlikely alliance of pro-Tibetan activists and members of the Japanese far-right, the demonstrators are unlikely to overshadow what is being billed as a symbolic turning point in Sino-Japanese ties after years of barely concealed hostility. The Chinese leader, who is making his longest overseas visit since becoming president in 2003, struck a conciliatory note soon after arriving at Haneda airport in Tokyo amid tight security. &quot;Japan and China are both important countries in Asia and the world,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;[This visit] will enhance friendship and cooperation in both countries.&quot; Over the next five days Hu will meet the Japanese prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, and dine with the emperor and empress, whom he is expected to invite to the opening ceremony of the Olympic games. He will address students at Waseda University in Tokyo, visit historic temples and, if time allows, take on Fukuda at table tennis in echoes of the ping-pong diplomacy that led to a thaw in ties between China and the US in the early 1970s. Nature has determined that the leaders will also try to find a solution to Japan&apos;s pressing panda problem. The death last month of Ling Ling, a gift from China in 1992, has presented Hu with the opportunity to further endear himself to his hosts if, as many expect, he agrees to provide a replacement for the popular resident of Ueno zoo in Tokyo. In the past Chinese leaders used Japan&apos;s lack of contrition over its wartime conduct as an excuse to cut off top-level contacts, a diplomatic freeze that lasted several years until Shinzo Abe visited Beijing days after becoming prime minister in the autumn of 2006. This week, however, Hu likened the atmosphere surrounding his visit to a &quot;warm spring&quot;. &quot;I sincerely hope for generations of friendship between the people of China and Japan,&quot; he wrote in a message to a Japanese-language magazine. The countries&apos; economic ties, he said, had &quot;brought real benefits to the people of both countries and spurred the growth and development of each&quot;. Last year China replaced the US as Japan&apos;s biggest trading partner, with two-way trade worth $236.6bn (\u00a3118bn). Japanese foreign direct investment in China totaled $6.2bn. The optimism is partly fuelled by an agreement to avoid detailed discussion of controversial issues. Officials hinted that their joint communique would avoid mention of Japan&apos;s wartime record. References to other sensitive subjects, such as human rights, Taiwan and Tokyo&apos;s bid for a permanent seat on the UN security council, are still being negotiated, they said. But little progress is expected on competing claims on natural gas deposits beneath the East China Sea or Japanese demands for greater transparency over China&apos;s military spending, said to be $60bn this year. Hu&apos;s visit comes days after a newspaper poll found that a majority of Japanese supported a tougher line against China in light of its crackdown in Tibet, its military build-up and fears about the safety of its food exports. Chinese food exports to Japan were hit earlier this year after the discovery of pesticide in shipments of frozen dumplings. Despite underlying frictions, few expect a repeat of Jiang Zemin&apos;s visit in 1998, when the then president lectured his hosts on their wartime record and, in front of the emperor, demanded that Japan apologise in writing for its 1931-1945 occupation of China. Hu, by contrast, is expected to seek support for the Olympics from Japan, whose criticism of the suppression of protests in Tibet was muted even before Beijing agreed to meet representatives of the Dalai Lama last weekend. While Fukuda described Tibet as an &quot;international problem&quot; he is thought unlikely to embarrass his guest with overt public criticism of China&apos;s human rights record. The leaders are also expected to support a commitment to halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, just weeks before the leader of the G8 group of rich nations meet in northern Japan. Hu&apos;s visit is the clearest sign yet of a thaw in relations that began with the departure of Junichiro Koizumi as Japan&apos;s prime minister in 2006. A year earlier, Koizumi&apos;s repeated visits to Yasukuni, a nationalist shrine devoted to Japan&apos;s war dead, and his government&apos;s approval of revisionist history textbooks, culminated in anti-Japanese protests in several Chinese cities. Fukuda, regarded as the most pro-China Japanese leader for years, has pointedly refused to visit the shrine, which also honours more than a dozen class-A war criminals. Andrew Horvat, a professor at Tokyo Keizai University, said the two countries &quot;have gone through a very difficult 10 years and have realised that abusing history for short-term diplomatic and political gains has its costs. I think they have learned that.&quot; For now, many Japanese will be satisfied with a deal on a replacement for Ling Ling, whose death aged 22 was a cause for national mourning. &quot;It would be nice if we had a panda there again,&quot; Fukuda said ahead of Hu&apos;s visit."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/06/news.awardsandprizes", "publicationDate": "2008-05-06T14:31:01Z", "tags": ["Books", "Awards and prizes", "Frank O'Connor award", "Culture", "Self-publishing"], "sentences": ["There are also individual nominees from Canada, Singapore, Taiwan and Nigeria.", "The longlist in full is:  From Ireland  Gilded Shadows Mary Rochford (Tia Publishing) Storm over Belfast Mary O&apos;Donnell (New Island) Country of the Grand Gerard Donovan (Faber &amp; Faber) Taking Pictures Anne Enright (Jonathan Cape) The Deportees Roddy Doyle (Jonathan Cape) From Britain Torc James Waddington (Ogo Press) The Loudest Sound and Nothing Clare Wigfall (Faber) 29 Ways to Drown Niki Aguirre (Flipped Eye Publishing) Little Marvel Wendy Perriam (Robert Hale Limited) Aroma Bingo David Gaffney (Salt Publishing) Some New Ambush Carys Davies (Salt Publishing) Balancing on the Edge of the World Elizabeth Baines (Salt Publishing) Broken Things Padrika Tarrant (Salt Publishing) Searching Glance Linda Cracknell (Salt Publishing) The I Love You Book William Guy (Salt Publishing) Vanessa Gebbie Words From a Glass Bubble (Salt Publishing) Body Parts: The Anatomy of Love Richard Bardsley (Salt Publishing) Tiny Deaths Robert Shearman (Comma Press) Instruction Manual for Swallowing Adam Marek (Comma Press) From Australia  Her Father&apos;s Daughter John Clancy (University of Queensland Press) A History of the Beanbag Susan Midalia (Uwa Press) Camera Obscura Daughter Kathryn Lomer (University of Queensland Press) The Boat Nam Le (Canongate) From New Zealand  Transported Tim Jones (Random House New Zealand) Etiquette for a Dinner Party Sue Orr (Random House New Zealand) The Girl Who Proposed Elizabeth Smither (Cape Catley) Ask The Posts Of The House Witi Ihimaera (Raupo) From the US  Unaccustomed Earth Jhumpa Lahiri (Knopf/Bloomsbury) Jazz and Twelve O&apos;Clock Tales Wanda Coleman (Black Sparrow Books) Refresh, Refresh Benjamin Percy (Jonathan Cape) Trespassing - Dirt Stories and Field Notes Janet Kauffman (Wayne State University Press) Like You&apos;d Understand, Anyway Jim Shepard (Knopf) Signaling For Rescue Marianne Herrmann (New Rivers Press) Desert Gothic Don Waters (University of Iowa Press) Knockemstiff Donald Ray Pollock (Harvill Secker) From Canada  Fifteen Modern Tales of Attraction Alison MacLeod (Hamish Hamilton) From Singapore  Lions in Winter Wena Poon (MPH Group) From Taiwan  Urn&apos;s Bottom Village Stories Egoyan Zheng (Qian-Ci Zheng) (Press Store Publishing) From Nigeria Dandaula and Other African Tales Tubal R Cain (Precious Styles)"], "title": "Self-published author takes competition to bestseller rivals", "article": "This year&apos;s 39-strong longlist for the \u008035,000 Frank O&apos;Connor international short story prize sees a runaway American bestseller vying with an almost unknown, self-published author.

The trip is being carefully managed by both countries, and is being watched closely around the world, with good reason: Sino-Japanese relations over the past decade have been turbulent, to say the least. When Hu&apos;s predecessor, Jiang Zemin, travelled to Japan 10 years ago, bilateral relations were deteriorating: China was unhappy with the Japanese government&apos;s refusal to extend the same apology offered to South Korea for past aggression; Japan was worried about a rising China and thus becoming more confrontational. The Japanese media&apos;s coverage of the visit was overwhelmingly negative, and it was remembered as a public relations disaster. Hu succeeded Jiang in 2002, almost as former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi was coming to power in Japan, and encouraged &quot;New Thinking&quot; in China&apos;s Japan policy. This entailed moving away from historical grievances and promoting better ties. But, instead of accepting China&apos;s olive branch, Koizumi implemented a more nationalistic agenda, including annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine, which is regarded as a symbol of Japanese militarism by Japan&apos;s neighbours. His hardline approach isolated Japan and angered China, leading to an outburst of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China in 2005. But both Japan and China recognise that further tension will serve neither country&apos;s long-term interests. Koizumi&apos;s successors, Prime ministers Shinzo Abe and Yasuo Fukuda, have sought to engage China over the past two years, with summits in Beijing and a successful visit by Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, to Japan last year. Hu&apos;s trip is likely follow the example set by Wen. He will emphasise common strategic interests, highlight mutual economic benefits, generate positive public opinion, and promote further exchanges. Japan is not only one of China&apos;s largest trade and investment partners, it is also the most powerful neighbour with which China wants to be on good terms, partly to showcase that China&apos;s rise is not a threat to Asia and the rest of the world. Japan, whose economic recovery is attributable largely to its deepening ties with China in recent years, is also eager to demonstrate that it regards China not as a threat but as an opportunity, as least in economic terms. It was 30 years ago that former prime minister, Takeo Fukuda, the father of today&apos;s prime minister, signed a peace and friendship treaty with China. The two governments will certainly use Hu&apos;s visit to celebrate the anniversary with new programmes designed to enhance bilateral understanding and friendship. But, unlike three decades ago, when the Japanese regarded China as one of their most favoured countries, public opinion in both countries nowadays registers more negative feelings than positive ones. Behind the smiles, the polite interactions, and the cautiously worded diplomatic language, strong undercurrents of suspicion remain. One problem is the disputed waters of the East China Sea. Despite new joint projects in energy efficiency and environmental protection, areas in which China ranks Japan as the best performer among industrialised countries, the two sides remain in bitterly divided over these territorial waters, which contain huge potential oil, gas, and other mineral deposits. Even after many rounds of talks, no resolution is in sight, and Hu&apos;s visit is not expected to produce any breakthroughs. Then there are strategic suspicions. Fukuda has dropped Abe&apos;s talk about an &quot;arch of freedom&quot; - an effort to forge a bloc with the US, Australia, and India. But Japan remains concerned about China&apos;s rapidly modernising military, while China worries about a potential US-Japan containment strategy for China, especially in the case of a crisis in the Taiwan Straits. So, although both sides endorse the idea of a &quot;mutually beneficial strategic relationship,&quot; and despite progress bilateral on military exchanges, mutual trust and confidence-building have a long way to go. Moreover, today&apos;s &quot;warm politics, cool economics&quot; trend is the reverse of the &quot;cold politics, warm economics&quot; pattern under Koizumi. Last year, Japan&apos;s committed investment projects in China fell 24% from 2006, while actual investment volume decreased by 25%, partly owing to regulatory changes in China regarding foreign investment. Recent food safety issues, such as the &quot;poisoned dumplings&quot; cases, have clearly heightened the Japanese public&apos;s sensitivity about Chinese exports. Finally, historical issues could still resurface to cause new problems. While Fukuda has made it clear that he will not visit the Yasukuni shrine, 160 other parliamentarians paid homage at the site last month, an indication that conservative forces in Japan remain strong and that future prime ministers may not abstain from visiting Yasukuni. And Japan has so far failed to live up to its treaty obligations to clean up between 700,000 and two million chemical weapons that were abandoned in China by the Japanese army at the end of the second world war, another potential flashpoint if any of these weapons causes casualties in China.

If one thinks of all the exhibitions, television programmes and column inches that have been devoted to every aspect of Chinese society in this country over the course of the year as a microcosm of what is happening globally, China&apos;s hopes have not been dashed. But the riots in Tibet in March greatly tarnished Beijing&apos;s reputation in the eyes of the world: it revealed a country that has signally failed to acknowledge and respect ethnic and racial difference. Tibet, for the moment, remains on hold, as we await the extent to which Beijing is serious about its talks with the representatives of the Dalai Lama. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has made major progress on the two most important foreign policy issues that confront it, which both happen to be on its doorstep. Hu Jintao is presently on a five-day visit to Japan, the first by a Chinese leader since 1998. Relations between the two countries went into deep freeze during the premiership of Junichiro Koizumi between 2001 and 2006, who insisted on visiting the Yasukuni war shrine, an action widely seen as a deliberate snub to China. As a result, all high-level contacts between the two countries were suspended. Since Koizumi&apos;s departure, relations between the second and third largest economies in the world have slowly been improving, helped by the fact that the present Japanese premier, Yasuo Fukuda, has long been associated with a more accommodating attitude towards China. The agreement signed by the two leaders fails to signal progress on any of the major issues that divide them, but nonetheless marks a significant improvement in relations. The joint statement, reiterating that the two countries should be partners rather than a threat to each other, has been proclaimed as the fourth important document to be signed since Japan and China restored diplomatic relations in 1972. Underlying the deep animosity between the two countries is Japan&apos;s occupation of China between 1931 and 1945 and its brutal treatment of the Chinese. In an attempt to defuse what is a highly-charged issue in China especially, the two governments earlier appointed a joint commission of historians to examine the matter which is due to report later this year. The other major subject of contention - which could potentially lead to military conflict between the two countries - is the issue of sovereignty over the Senkaku Islands, which both claim, and the disputed maritime border in the East China Sea, which involves the rights to the rich reserves of oil and gas on the seabed. An agreement was supposed to have been reached in 2007, but Hu this week claimed that &quot;prospects for settling the dispute are already in view and I&apos;m happy about this&quot;. The divisions between the two countries are so deep and so intractable that it seems unlikely that any major breakthrough on the issues in dispute can be expected now or in the near future. Nonetheless, the fact that the two sides are talking and that the mood music is upbeat represents a significant advance. Japan is nervous and fearful of China&apos;s rise while in China there is a deep loathing of the Japanese. The tensions between the two - and the resulting potential for conflict - are greater than is the case between any two other major powers. The rapprochement between Hu and Fukuda is a welcome sign and also serves to burnish China&apos;s image as a responsible power prior to the Olympics. The other major issue on which China has made progress this year is Taiwan. This largely got lost in the wave of revulsion over the treatment of Tibet, but in fact is highly significant. As far as China is concerned there is no issue of greater importance than the eventual return of Taiwan to China. Ever since 2000, it has been an increasingly elusive goal, however, as the Taiwanese displayed a growing desire to assert a Taiwanese rather than Chinese identity. But wooed by a clever Chinese charm offensive and mindful of the huge potential offered by the Chinese market, the Taiwanese decisively rejected the nationalists in the recent elections and turned once again to the Kuomintang and its new leader Ma Ying-jeou, who has promised to build a new and friendly relationship with China. From a Beijing perspective, the outlook for its relationship with Taiwan has rarely, if ever, looked better since the island first split from China in 1949. In April, Hu met the Taiwanese vice-president, the first ever high-level contact between the two sides. If Hu finds himself confounded by Tibet, he can take considerable satisfaction from China&apos;s improving relationship with Japan and especially Taiwan."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/may/14/childprotection", "publicationDate": "2008-05-14T10:48:52Z", "tags": ["Child protection", "Society", "Human trafficking", "Crime", "World news", "Netherlands", "Europe"], "sentences": ["Some of the 14 have come from Sierra Leone and Taiwan, others from Bulgaria and Gujarat in India."], "title": "Robert Booth on Dutch solution model for missing children from UK local authority care", "article": "It could be a group straight out of a Benetton advertisement - teenage girls from China, India, Africa and Europe. But these are residents of a secret safe house in the Netherlands for children who have been trafficked by criminal gangs into prostitution and other forms of forced labour in Europe. Some of the 14 have come from Sierra Leone and Taiwan, others from Bulgaria and Gujarat in India. The youngest, a 14-year-old, has a baby who is starting to crawl. Four of the girls are pregnant - most likely a consequence of their exploitation as prostitutes. In the UK, evidence emerged last month that more than 400 suspected victims of trafficking have gone missing from local authority care, triggering calls from politicians in the three main parties for the government to act. Keith Vaz, chair of a home affairs select committee investigation into human trafficking, says he is &quot;shocked by the number of children going missing&quot; and his committee is taking evidence about how it can be stopped. An increasing number of child protection campaigners and politicians in Britain believe the Dutch-style system of guardians for every foreign child suspected of having been trafficked may hold the answer to protecting these vulnerable youngsters from falling back into exploitation. In the Netherlands, there are 2,157 rescued children looked after by guardians. These are professional social workers who handle the legal status, housing and education of their charges. The most vulnerable are given 24-hour care and chaperones when they go out. For some, the fear of being taken back by traffickers is so great that they cannot even skip in the safe-house yard without someone to watch over them. The Dutch ministry of justice funds the \u20ac25m (\u00a319.7m) a year system run by Nidos, an independent child protection agency. Now 8% a year go missing from care, a third fewer than estimates for the UK. So far, the Home Office has said a similar guardianship system for Britain is unnecessary, but in the Netherlands the challenges facing the authorities are much the same as in the UK. &quot;There is a big risk the traffickers will pick the children up [from care] and we have seen it,&quot; says Karin, a guardian at the safe house. &quot;The trafficker tells them their future will be better, so they go with them. Often, [the children] have to pay back a lot of money - we hear about fees of \u20ac40,000 [\u00a331,600] for their trip to Europe - so the pressure [to go with the traffickers] is very big. The traffickers also threaten to hurt their family.&quot; CCTV cameras film all the approaches to the safe house. The social workers operate a system of green, amber and red alerts relating to the threat of abduction of each child, based on police intelligence and information the girls give. But from the outside, the house offers few clues to its purpose. It stands in the heart of Dutch suburbia in an acre of gardens. There is an exercise bike and a box of skipping ropes to make up for the regular confinement that is for their own safety. The property is one of four safe houses - two for girls, two for boys - located in north Netherlands, away from the big cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam where the traffickers are most active. The guardianship system aims to make the children self-reliant by the time they reach 18 and focuses on educating them about what has happened to them so that they appreciate the criminal behaviour of the trafficker. It also helps them plan a future in the country. The children must learn basic Dutch before they can attend school. Life in the safe house can be frustrating and many of the girls are eager to move away from 24-hour care. &quot;I eat, I sleep, but I am not living a good life,&quot; says Lauren, a 17-year-old from Guinea. &quot;Eat and sleep is not life for me. When you sit here, you have to think about the problems when you came here. That for me is painful. My pain is not for lack of sleep, food or clothes but I have big pain in my head.&quot; &quot;I need something good for me in the future,&quot; says Maya, a 17-year-old from Sierra Leone. &quot;I&apos;d like to go to school to learn more to be a better child for my parents and myself tomorrow. I&apos;d like to be a nurse. I don&apos;t know if this will happen here. I don&apos;t have anyone here, only the guardians who help me. I feel safe when I am in here inside. But I am not safe for the future. I want to learn more.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/15/stockmarkets.bhpbilliton", "publicationDate": "2008-05-14T23:45:03Z", "tags": ["BHP Billiton", "Rio Tinto", "Mining", "Business"], "sentences": ["The company announced a six-year agreement to supply its products to Taiwan&apos;s Gintech Energy Corporation and raised its revenue forecasts for the year from $550m to $590m (\u00a3303m) after forecast-beating first-quarter results."], "title": "Market forces: BHP peaking on a Chinese whisper", "article": "For the second day running the mining sector was alive with speculation. After talk this week that BHP Billiton was considering an increase in its proposed offer for Rio Tinto came speculation that BHP itself could be the subject of Chinese stakebuilding. BHP shares closed 98p higher at a record \u00a321.18 on reports that state-owned Chinese aluminium company Chinalco wanted to buy up to 10% of the company, with a price of about A$60 (\u00a328.84) a share being mentioned. Chinalco, in tandem with US group Alcoa, shook the sector this year by snapping up 9% of Rio Tinto in a dawn raid. On Tuesday traders were hearing that BHP may increase its offer from 3.4 to 3.8 of its shares for every Rio one owned, and yesterday BHP chief executive Marius Kloppers hinted to CNBC that he had not ruled out adding a cash element to sweeten the deal further. Rio ended 236p ahead at \u00a368.81. &quot;We have rarely seen so much rumour and speculation on a takeover but we have never seen an offer of this scale in the mining industry,&quot; said analyst John Meyer at Fairfax. &quot;The result is to push Rio Tinto shares higher for now but investors should remember that this could be short lived. BHP&apos;s stock could fall on a raised bid and this in turn might drag Rio Tinto&apos;s shares lower.&quot; Amid all the gossip in the sector there were some actual events, notably an upbeat trading statement from Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation. The company, which this week dropped its proposed bid for Kazakhmys, said high commodity prices had boosted its first-quarter revenues, and its shares jumped 99p to \u00a314.76. It was also helped by news that Kazakhstan&apos;s government had been holding talks with the country&apos;s mining groups about its controversial proposal for a metals export duty, prompting hopes of an agreement. Deutsche Bank restarted coverage of ENRC after the collapse of the Kazakhmys deal with a buy rating and \u00a315.50p target. Credit Suisse raised its forecast from \u00a310 a share to \u00a316, saying: &quot;Management&apos;s decision to essentially walk from Kazakhmys has reduced the risk of them overpaying for assets.&quot; Without the miners the FTSE 100 would have ended the day in the red. As it was, with the sector adding 26 points, the leading index closed 4.1 points higher at 6216.0. A bright opening on Wall Street after better than expected US inflation figures also helped. But there were a number of factors dragging on the market. For one, the Bank of England&apos;s inflation report seemed to suggest there may be no more interest rate cuts for two years. On top of that came a host of cash calls. FirstGroup fell 37.5p to 561.5p as it placed 43.8m shares to raise \u00a3236m for US expansion. Johnston Press asked shareholders for \u00a3212m and its shares lost 20.5p to 115.25p. Bradford &amp; Bingley dropped 14.75p to 144p after it announced a \u00a3300m rights issue, at 82p a share, a month after saying it would not need one. The news had analysts speculating on which bank could follow suit. James Hutson at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods said: &quot;On read-across, we can no longer discount Alliance &amp; Leicester, Barclays or even Lloyds joining the party.&quot; Barclays lost 10.5p to 427.25p before its update today. Barratt Developments dropped 8.75p to 248.5p after a downbeat trading statement, although it announced a refinancing of an \u00a3800m loan that allowed it to avoid a widely anticipated rights issue. The gathering gloom over the housing market saw Persimmon fall 30p to 550.5p and Taylor Wimpey end 6.25p lower at 127.75p. IT group LogicaCMG, whose shares have risen sharply this week on takeover hopes, added another 5p to 130.5p after it said first-quarter revenues had risen by 3.6% and issued an upbeat outlook statement. Chinese group ReneSola, a manufacturer of solar wafers, jumped 90p to 610.5p. The company announced a six-year agreement to supply its products to Taiwan&apos;s Gintech Energy Corporation and raised its revenue forecasts for the year from $550m to $590m (\u00a3303m) after forecast-beating first-quarter results. Analysts at HansonWesthouse said: &quot;The shares are still trading at a significant discount to the wider solar sector - a disparity we believe is undeserved given the rapidly improving visibility. As such, we believe that a short-term price target of 800p is easily justifiable.&quot; On Aim, Allergy Therapeutics added 6p to 34.75p after it announced positive trial results for its hay fever vaccine. Elizabeth Klein at Landsbanki said: &quot;We suggest that this data will increase confidence in the company&apos;s products and therefore retain our buy recommendation and 66p fair value [target].&quot; Finally sofa retailer ScS Upholstery slumped 10% to 47p as it warned profits would be below forecasts in the wake of a 14% dive in like-for-like sales in the past eight weeks. Rival Land of Leather lost 12% to 37.5p. Geared up Keep an eye on Torotrak, which designs and makes gearbox systems. It is a favourite with private investors, who have had a bumpy ride recently, with the company&apos;s shares falling from 34p last October to 19p in March, before recovering to their current level of 25.5p. The company is due to report annual results next Tuesday, and shareholders will be particularly keen to hear more details of its licence agreement with Indian group Tata Motors. Yesterday internet bulletin boards were full of speculation that the deal with Tata could involve the payment of a \u00a31.7m licence fee and royalty payments of between 2.5% and 3.5%, depending on which vehicles Torotrak technology was used in. nick.fletcher@theguardian.com Market Forces Live at: blogs.theguardian.com/markets"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/may/17/abaseballcapthatreadsyour", "publicationDate": "2008-05-17T15:30:32Z", "tags": ["Gadgets", "Technology"], "sentences": ["People have been experimenting with using brainwaves to control computers for a couple of decades, but now &quot;a team of researchers from Taiwan has designed the new bio-signal monitoring system inside a baseball cap with the goal of making it convenient and easy to use in everyday life,&quot; reports Physorg.com."], "title": "A baseball cap that reads your mind", "article": "People have been experimenting with using brainwaves to control computers for a couple of decades, but now &quot;a team of researchers from Taiwan has designed the new bio-signal monitoring system inside a baseball cap with the goal of making it convenient and easy to use in everyday life,&quot; reports Physorg.com.

Behind a darkened window was China&apos;s President, speeding past the flattened houses, rock falls and waiting survivors. Later that day state television&apos;s wall-to-wall earthquake coverage would show Hu Jintao reassuring the injured and spurring rescuers on to greater efforts.But those who sat at the roadside in the baking Sichuan heat barely registered the startling presence of their leader on this devastated soil. Nor did they register the unprecedented show of emotion from cabinet spokesman Guo Weimin, who had to stop to compose himself as he read from an updated casualty report which put the death toll so far at 28,881. Five days after the 7.9-magnitude quake hit the south-western province, destroying millions of homes and tens of thousands of lives, as their government&apos;s humane reaction to this disaster is changing perceptions of the communist regime around the world, these farmers thought only of those they loved and of survival. One woman had walked for three days with her baby and young daughter to reach this spot. All were hungry and dazed. Beads of sweat gathered on their foreheads as they waited for a ride. A chicken poked its head through the hole in a sack and squawked irritably, but its owner had salvaged nothing else and had no intention of leaving it behind. A truck pulled up and the exhausted farmers hoisted themselves over the sides, cramming their meagre possessions in around them. Clinging to the sides, they rattled down the steep road. Doorways poked out of the hillside where the houses around them had disintegrated. Giant rocks littered the road and vehicles lay in ditches, thrown off the road by the force of the shock. Somewhere ahead lay safety. &apos;The feeling of the earthquake was like this lorry,&apos; said one of the farmers, as the vehicle jolted and shook its way across the countryside. He was companionable and chatty, though he didn&apos;t want to give his real name; we called him Mr Wu.  At 2.28pm last Monday, Wu was tending his cornfield. &apos;It was like a bomb exploding out of the ground,&apos; he said. &apos;Everything shook. Our house collapsed and then the whole mountain. The sky was dark, the way it goes before rain. No one could stand. The telegraph poles fell and the land slipped into cracks. My wife and daughter were fine, but a lot of our neighbours died.&apos; Landslides on the road into town and between the centre and the main road, had blocked all hope of rescue. The heavy rains that followed prevented helicopter drops. Like thousands across this vast swath of Sichuan, Wu and his neighbours had to help themselves. &apos;Those who were alive helped those who were trapped and injured. Even on the third day we got someone out alive. Now I have time to look for my son,&apos; he said. &apos;He was at Beichuan middle school and we can&apos;t get in touch with him.&apos; Wu had risen early that morning and walked for 10 hours over the mountain to find a lift, stopping first at the school. &apos;People there told me a lot of kids were taken straight to the Mianyang refugee camp, so I&apos;m going there to see if I can find him,&apos; he said, sounding resolute but calm. His mood could have been either optimism or denial: he must have known that hundreds of pupils - two-thirds of the roll - had died at that school.  As the lorry rattled its way to Mianyang, Wu spoke about his son, 16-year-old Ming, a book-loving boy who hoped to become a lawyer. &apos;You couldn&apos;t really call him talkative,&apos; he said, showing his son&apos;s ID card. Despite the dangers of Beichuan, still at risk from aftershocks, landslides and flooding, many locals were only leaving the area to search for other family members elsewhere. Some fear that the destruction wrought in Beichuan - and the sheer number of corpses in the rubble - will turn it into a ghost town. But Wu insisted he would return once the road was unblocked. &apos;We have no money to rebuild the house, but we can live in tents,&apos; he said. &apos;At least my crops are OK.&apos; He shook his head and smiled when asked if he was afraid. &apos;I have buried so many dead bodies, I do not feel frightened any more,&apos; he said. Two men leant over the side of the moving truck, sharing a cigarette as they watched the countryside speed past. Other passengers, too tired or traumatised to speak, huddled in the corners, heads down. Each time the driver braked, the travellers lurched against each other and quacks of protest rose from ducks jammed in among cloth bundles. At Mianyang, the truck emptied quickly, its passengers keen to begin their search for loved ones, pausing only to help the others down. Outside the main refugee camp, thousands of homeless families lay beneath tarpaulins or milled aimlessly on the grass. Wu dashed from one group to another, seeking news of the middle school. A young woman directed him to a centre seven kilometres away. Taxis ferrying survivors there without charge were crammed. A private car pulled over and the men inside urged Wu to get in. There were 60,000 refugees in Mianyang city - itself hit hard by the quake - they told him. On a street corner a giant screen flashed the latest rescue update. Wu grew quieter. Changhong, a major local employer, had taken charge of the middle school pupils, handling matters with corporate efficiency. A dozen pieces of A4 paper, stuck to the marble wall of its restaurant, bore the names of those who had escaped the shock. Wu scanned them methodically: his son&apos;s name was not there. Only two of his classmates were listed. &apos;I&apos;m mentally prepared,&apos; Wu told a Changhong volunteer as they walked across the compound to find the pupils. &apos;It&apos;s a natural disaster.&apos; The man slipped an arm around Wu&apos;s shoulder. Hundreds of teenagers were bedded down in the firm&apos;s sports centre, waiting for someone to claim them. Outside, anxious parents sought news of their children. The two survivors from Ming&apos;s class had vanished, but Wu settled down to wait for other pupils. &apos;I want to see if I can find my neighbour&apos;s kid. They heard she was OK, but her name is not on the list. Even if I can&apos;t find her here, maybe I can ask the other children for any information about her or my boy,&apos; he said. Then he murmured: &apos;I don&apos;t want to think there&apos;s no hope.&apos; The company had provided sleeping bags, clean clothes, food and phones. Two televisions, intended to provide distraction, showed vivid images of rock slides, buildings torn sideways and mounds of debris. Many of their fathers and mothers lay somewhere in the town. Seventeen-year-old Long Xiang was subdued; she had traced an aunt, but nothing was known of her parents. She had been on the top floor when the quake hit. All her classmates survived, jumping out of their shattered room over the remains of the building. She was not sure how Wu&apos;s son, Ming, would have fared. &apos;Class 10 was on the fourth floor too, but they were in the older building and we were in the new one,&apos; she said. Children were still being pulled free days later. Another pupil, 16-year-old Zheng Youquan, stressed the good fortune of his form: only 10 of 65 classmates were dead. &apos;It started to shake and right away I hid under my desk. Then the floor just gave way. We were trapped and didn&apos;t know what was happening,&apos; he said. &apos;Because I was hidden, I was not injured, but after a long time I realised the girl who shared my desk was dead. I touched her leg, the only part of her body I could reach, to feel her temperature. Some of my classmates were injured and I shouted to them to be calm and not fall asleep. People closer to the hole asked us to be quiet so they could cry for help. Then another class came to rescue us.&apos; Many survivors, like Zheng, seem too shocked to understand what has befallen them. &apos;I didn&apos;t really feel frightened. I don&apos;t know if I have already become numb,&apos; he said. &apos;Standing here, I feel there are tremors. I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s paranoia or not. The scene of my classmates will always be in my mind. It keeps coming back to me. I don&apos;t think of anything else.&apos; As he left for dinner, he urged us: &apos;Please, be careful, you must watch out for landslides.&apos;  The scale of this catastrophe is hard to contemplate. Although China&apos;s swift response has been praised, the determination of some 150,000 troops and paramilitary police seems puny set against the might of the quake. Almost five million people are homeless; 190,000 injured; probably 50,000 have died. There are thousands of orphans and newly childless couples. Attention is already turning to the daunting challenge of rebuilding shattered areas and housing 4.8 million homeless survivors. Some have begun to return to their homes, despite the continuing tremors, fearing they have nowhere else to go. The government has pledged a probe into whether shoddy construction linked to corruption was responsible for the collapse of almost 7,000 school buildings, amid anger from parents. The government&apos;s unusual openness has been matched by an extraordinary outpouring of public generosity. The overwhelming mood has been one of unity in the face of the challenge, with the government appealing to the public for support and a massive voluntary drive to rescue, feed and shelter survivors. Across the province, firefighters have worked around the clock. Volunteers have risked their lives to rescue trapped victims. The bereaved have helped to reunite families; the hungry and homeless have refused food and water in case others needed it more. Sichuan saw disaster last week, and a wrenching pain that will scar the community for the decades to come. It also saw patience, dignity, courage and love.Additional research by Chen Shi A tragedy in numbers  \u00b7 China expects the death toll to exceed 50,000, with 4.8 million people thought to have lost their homes. \u00b7 More than 198,300 people have been injured; up to 12,000 are still trapped. \u00b7 The government is spending \u00a3380m on the aid and rescue effort.

As with his dreadful endeavour talking to the world&apos;s tallest women, Dolan&apos;s charmlessness lets him down, whether chatting to the Nepalese 16-year-old who&apos;s 64cm tall, trying to persuade a Mongolian family to talk to him, or simply indulging in a disingenuous voiceover in which he ponders &quot;Are they being exploited?&quot; The rejoinder to which is, presumably, &quot;And if not, can we have a go?&quot; One Life Special: Mum and Me 10.35pm, BBC1 Sue Bourne, whose last documentary was the infuriating My Street on Channel 4, here films her mum, Ethel, who has Alzheimer&apos;s, over three years.

Certainly there are a lot of laughs as Ethel, Sue and Holly, Sue&apos;s daughter, struggle through all-too-common circumstances, but also captured are moments of desolation, anger and sorrow.

At the start of his four-year term, Ma Ying-jeou, of the nationalist party, said the first step towards rapprochement should be the normalisation of diplomatic and cultural relations. But despite his conciliatory tone, the former Taipei mayor promised to maintain the island&apos;s democratic self-rule and appealed to Beijing to grant the island more space on the international stage. &quot;Taiwan doesn&apos;t just want security and prosperity,&quot; he said. &quot;It wants dignity. Only when Taiwan is no longer being isolated in the international arena can cross-strait relations move forward with confidence.&quot; Many of the conditions for a resumption of dialogue, which broke down in 1998, are already in place.  There have been meetings of officials from the two sides. The fierce rhetoric that characterised relations during the eight-year term of the previous Taiwan president, Chen Shui-bian, has softened. Ma said recent comments by Chinese president Hu Jintao were &quot;very much in line&quot; with his own views. &quot;Seeking cross-strait peace and maintaining regional stability is our goal and Taiwan still strives to become a peacemaker in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;I sincerely hope the two sides can make the best use of this historic chance to create a new chapter of peace and prosperity.&quot; To improve the climate further, Ma called for a diplomatic truce. The two sides have spent billions trying to win support from third countries and representation on international organisations. In the latest of many recent defeats for Taiwan, its bid for observer status in the World Health Organisation was rejected yesterday. Ma said the island should be given more room to operate. &quot;In the light of our common Chinese heritage, people on both sides should do their utmost to jointly contribute to the international community without engaging in vicious competition and a waste of resources,&quot; he said. The speech attempted to steer a middle path in domestic politics too. One of the main dividing lines in Taiwan is between the island&apos;s indigenous population, who tend to be more pro-independence, and the families of mainland immigrants who fled there after being defeated by Mao Zedong&apos;s communist forces in 1949. Ma said Taiwan&apos;s residents belonged to the Chinese people, a description that will please Beijing&apos;s leaders, particularly because it contrasts with the former president Chen&apos;s emphasis on the island&apos;s distinctive identity. But he also praised Taiwan&apos;s tolerance of immigration - pointing out that he was also born outside the island - and its democratic political system, which is very different from the one-party rule on the mainland. He repeated a promise that there would be no unification while he was in office.

The announcement came as foreign medical teams and mobile hospital equipment were dispatched to the region after government appeals for medical aid from the international community. With only slim hopes of finding more people alive, the scope of the mission has shifted to caring for those who have survived, including the 250,000 people left injured. The death toll is expected to pass 50,000 and 5 million people have been left homeless after the 7.9-magnitude quake last Monday, according to China&apos;s state council. The Sichuan vice-governor, Li Chengyun, told a news conference there were 39,577 confirmed deaths in the province, 236,359 people had been injured and 32,361 were missing. Hundreds of aftershocks have been felt over the past week, leaving thousands of people so anxious they are sleeping in cars and in the street, fearing more building collapses. Temporary housing was being set up by the government for those unable to stay with relatives, but Jiang Li, the vice-minister of civil affairs, said there was a &quot;desperate need for tents&quot; to accommodate them. Nearly 280,000 tents had been shipped to the area and 700,000 more had been ordered, Jiang said. &quot;Despite generous donations, the disaster is so great that victims still face a challenge in finding living accommodation,&quot; she said. Qin Gang, the foreign ministry spokesman, said &apos;&apos;China is willing to work closely&apos;&apos; with outside doctors. &quot;But given the situation, and difficulties in the area, including transportation and telecommunications, it is not possible for us to accept all of the rescue and medical teams to engage in relief work.&quot; A Russian medical team arrived with a mobile hospital today in Chengdu, the Sichuan provincial capital. The Taiwan Red Cross had sent a 37-member medical team to the disaster zone, Japan had sent a 23-strong disaster relief team and medical crews had been sent by the US, Germany and Italy. Further stories of extraordinary rescues have emerged. Ma Yuanjiang, 31, was saved after being trapped for 179 hours in the ruins of the Yingxiu Bay hydropower plant, where he worked as a director, after a 30-hour rescue effort. A miner, Peng Guohua, was rescued yesterday and was in stable condition after being trapped for 170 hours. A giant panda was returned to safety after going missing from the Wolong giant panda nature reserve. Two others remained unaccounted for but a forestry officer said they were &apos;&apos;very likely to be alive&apos;&apos;, although they could be distressed by the number of aftershocks. The quake killed five members of the reserve&apos;s staff and destroyed or damaged all 32 panda houses.  The local government had sent emergency supplies of bamboo and veterinary medicine for the pandas, along with food and tents for staff. Donations for disaster relief have reached 10.8bn yuan (\u00a3790,000) but people have been warned to donate through official channels and be on guard against internet scams.

After a two-year investigation, a group of policymakers and economists published a blueprint designed to allow the least developed nations to emulate the 13 countries that have expanded at an average rate of at least 7% a year for 25 years or longer since the second world war. Professor Mike Spence, chairman of the Commission on Growth and Development, said there was no prospect of meeting the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations - which include halving of the number of people living in poverty by 2015 - without faster growth.  Two billion of the 6 billion people in the world live in countries with stagnating or declining incomes, but the report said this figure would rise to 4 billion if they continued to suffer from low growth. &quot;The Growth Report kills off once and for all the misguided notion that you can lift people out of poverty in the absence of growth,&quot; Spence said. &quot;It is impossible for poor countries to lift large populations out of poverty without growth. Equality of opportunity and a focus on individuals and families, gender inequalities and economic security, however, is critical to maintaining the support for growth-oriented policies.&quot; The report said that the 13 countries that had grown rapidly in the post-war era were diverse, including Indonesia, Oman, Malta, Brazil, Botswana and China, but all had made the most of the global economy. &quot;This is their most important shared characteristic and the central lesson of this report. Sustained growth at this pace was not possible before 1950. It became feasible only because the global economy became more open and more tightly integrated. The global economy is still a work in progress, of course, but its effects have already been dramatic. &quot;The high-growth countries benefited in two ways. One, they imported ideas, technology and know-how from the rest of the world. Two, they exploited global demand, which provided a deep, elastic market for their goods. The inflow of knowledge dramatically increased the economy&apos;s productive potential; the global market provided the demand necessary to fulfil it. To put it very simply, they imported what the rest of the world knew, and exported what it wanted.&quot; Spence said faster growth was possible but required strong leadership, good governance and a commitment to equity. The report divided developing countries into four groups - sub-Saharan Africa, small countries, resource-rich states and middle-income countries - and said growth strategies had to be tailored to fit the requirements of individual nations.  &quot;Growth requires leadership, persistence and engagement with the global economy,&quot; Spence said. &quot;It also requires advanced economies to play their part as well - bringing an end to the current focus on energy subsidies and biofuels, and an end to the protectionist policies which limit developing world access to the global markets that are so central to growth.&quot; The study acknowledged that faster growth might worsen climate change but said the onus was on rich countries to promote technologies for cutting carbon and saving energy. &quot;In the interests of fairness, advanced economies, which are responsible for most of the problem, should take the lead in setting medium-term targets for cuts in their own emissions.&quot; It added: &quot;The quickened growth of world GDP has put new pressure on the planet&apos;s ecology and climate. This strain may ultimately threaten the growth environment of the last 200 years. If an economy fails to grow, man&apos;s efforts to better himself become a scramble for a bigger share of a fixed amount of resources.&quot; Success stories Per-capita rise in income to 2005 Country (period) Factor  Botswana (1960-2005) 18  Brazil (1950-80) 4.2 China (1961-2005) 13.3 Hong Kong (1960-97) 9.7 Indonesia (1966-97) 4.5 Japan (1950-83) 11.3 Malaysia (1967-97) 5.6 Malta (1963-94) 8.7 Oman (1960-99) 9.5 Singapore (1967-2002) 11.6 South Korea(1960-2001)12 Taiwan (1965-2002) 10.9 Thailand (1960-97) 7.3"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/may/22/bbc.television2", "publicationDate": "2008-05-22T16:46:51Z", "tags": ["BBC", "Television industry", "Media"], "sentences": ["On Tuesday the BBC admitted that a factory making Adolf Hitler dolls that it told viewers was part of the rise of Neo-Nazism in Ukraine was actually located in Taiwan."], "title": "BBC mistakenly announces verdict reached in Nisah Patel-Nasri murder trial verdict", "article": "The BBC has landed itself in hot water for another on-air gaffe today after the BBC News channel mistakenly announced that a verdict had been reached in the trial of the men accused of murdering special constable Nisah Patel-Nasri.

The state meteorological bureau last night forecast the approach of high winds and heavy or even torrential rain, threatening to add to the misery of survivors and the danger of flooding.  The ministry of water warned that 35 &quot;quake lakes&quot;, formed when landslides blocked rivers, now endangered survivors. Around 1,600 soldiers and paramilitary police - each carrying 10kg of explosives to blast through debris - were hiking to a blocked river outside Beichuan, Xinhua reported. Water is rising rapidly in the giant lake at Tangjiashan on the Jian river, by almost two metres yesterday alone. Authorities fear a flash flood if it bursts. Liu Ning, the ministry&apos;s chief engineer, told reporters in Beijing that around 20,000 people have been evacuated from the disaster area due to the flood risk, and another 80,000 might be relocated.  According to a 2004 paper by geologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, about 5,500 people were killed after quake lakes burst in the last century.  In 1786, a landslide dam formed by a major quake in Sichuan collapsed 10 days later, killing about 100,000 people. The ministry also warned that 69 dams in Sichuan were in danger of collapse. The worst-case scenario would be a domino effect, with a flash flood from one quake lake or dam causing lower-lying bodies of water to burst.  E Jingping, vice-minister of water resources, warned reporters that China had to use &quot;precious time&quot; before the rainy season begins - a month away - to shore up as many dams as possible. David Petley, professor of geography at the University of Durham, warned: &quot;If [the monsoon] is heavy we are likely to see substantial amounts of landslide activity ... The threats posed by this must not be underestimated. In the worst affected areas in the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, the area of landsliding increased three-fold in the next rainy season.&quot;  The confirmed death toll rose yesterday to 62,664 with another 23,775 people missing.  But state television reported that an 80-year-old man was rescued alive on Friday, more than 11 days after the initial tremor. Xiao Zhihu survived in his collapsed home in Mianzhu city because his wife was able to pass food to him through the rubble, the report said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/may/28/dyslexia.dore", "publicationDate": "2008-05-28T16:22:45Z", "tags": ["Neuroscience", "Controversies", "Medical research", "Science", "UK news", "World news", "Dyslexia"], "sentences": ["We are presently exploring alternative arrangements to ensure every client is cared for.&quot; The company is still operating in the US, the Caribbean, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa and Taiwan."], "title": "'Miracle dyslexia cure' firm on the ropes", "article": "A company that claimed to offer a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for dyslexia has closed its UK offices, leaving staff worried about whether they will be paid and parents unsure whether their children&apos;s treatment will be completed.  Dore, which was set up and funded by the millionaire paint entrepreneur Wynford Dore, promoted individualised exercise courses to patients to improve dyslexia symptoms such as poor reading and writing skills. Despite being promoted heavily in the media as a cure for dyslexia, the evidence base of the programme has been criticised by some scientists. The company&apos;s Australian operations went into administration on May 16, but the British arm of the company was still being promoted in the media last week. Last Monday, star of the Strictly Come Dancing TV show and Scottish rugby international Kenny Logan \u2013 who is paid to promote Dore \u2013 was on the Radio 4 consumer programme You and Yours plugging the company and giving a personal testimonial. On Friday, some clients received a personal email from Wynford Dore in which he said he had brought in &quot;advisors&quot; to &quot;help restructure things&quot; at the company. Calls to Dore&apos;s UK contact number were not answered yesterday or today, but a message on the website confirming the closure of the UK centres read: &quot;We are determined to find a way for every client who is on the program to have their treatment completed. We are presently exploring alternative arrangements to ensure every client is cared for.&quot; The company is still operating in the US, the Caribbean, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa and Taiwan. &quot;We are doing everything possible&quot; In a statement issued through Dore&apos;s representatives, Phil Hall Associates, in response to The Guardian&apos;s questions, the company said: &quot;The most important thing that we are focusing on is how clients part-way through the programme can continue and complete it. We will be updating clients within the next day or two about steps already taken that will help with this. We are very optimistic that an announcement will be made soon that will satisfy clients that we are doing everything possible to return to normal service soon.&quot; However, parents in the UK are anxious that their children may not be able to complete the programme \u2013 which can last up to two years \u2013 and that the \u00a32000 fee they paid up front may not be refunded.

Patient and celebrity testimonials Genevier said she decided to embark on the treatment, despite initial scepticism, because of hearing personal success stories. &quot;What swung it for me were the testimonials of patients and celebs. I know we all want it to work, and perhaps the more you pay the more you want it to work, but are we all fools?&quot; A 2006 paper in the journal Dyslexia that backed up the programme&apos;s effectiveness received a highly unusual nine critical commentaries from academics in the field. These pointed out that subjects were not randomised \u2013 meaning that experimenters decided which children received the treatment and which were placed in the &quot;control&quot; group.  Also, patients in the control group received no treatment at all, meaning that they were likely to be disadvantaged compared with the intense attention given to those on the Dore programme. Nevertheless, Dore said the treatment is backed by good research: &quot;What we can say is that our success rate when measured by independent research is remarkably high. Currently over 40,000 people have successfully gone through the programme.&quot;  The husband of one patient, a 33-year-old woman from Ballymoney in Northern Ireland who asked to remain anonymous, said he was currently in dispute with Dore over what he believes is his wife&apos;s lack of improvement on the treatment programme. &quot;They set up such an expectation that this will cure you,&quot; he said.  He has been trying to get a refund from the company, but now believes his chances of seeing the money are &quot;between nil and zero to be honest&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/may/30/biographicaldictionaryoffil15", "publicationDate": "2008-05-30T08:27:00Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "Music", "Ang Lee"], "sentences": ["We know the Ang Lee story because the world insists on telling it: how the Taiwan kid came to the universities of Illinois and New York, met James Schamus as a working partner, and went from those exquisite films about the Taiwanese and food (The Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman) to maybe the best Jane Austen film we have ever had (Sense and Sensibility)."], "title": "Biographical Dictionary of Film No 40: Ang Lee", "article": "Impressive: Ang Lee&apos;s Lust, Caution It was while reviewing Lust, Caution that Peter Bradshaw observed that each new Ang Lee film was like a work of architecture that altered our notion of what the city might be. By which I think Bradshaw meant that Lee - still only in his early 50s - gives more sense of urban possibilities than of his own obsessions. In other words, with nearly every film Lee is saying to us: &quot;Look, I could do this or that in such a way that a Gehry innovation could exist across the town square from a Gothic cathedral in a state of lively conversation - not hopeless contradiction.&quot; And so the man who got hip suburbia in the 70s (The Ice Storm), the instability of Kansas in the Civil War (Ride the Whirlwind) and that magical fantasia on martial arts and special effects (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), did Shanghai noir with Lust, Caution, and now proposes a film about Woodstock. Does he have any limits? Well, yes, by common consent The Hulk was a dead end, but one easily forgiven when it was followed by the audacious yet relaxed view of gay cowboys in Wyoming, Brokeback Mountain, as derived from Annie Proulx. This is an age in which, increasingly, film directors travel to work, and with results that sometimes show how very difficult multiculturalism can be. But Lee seems possessed by an intelligence, an openness and an engagement with human nature that can take any human story, and tell it with ease. Except that, as soon as I say that, I pause over Lust, Caution. It&apos;s not that I didn&apos;t like the film, and don&apos;t find something different waiting there every time I go back to it. But still I&apos;m not quite sure what that film wants to be. Is it a mark of reverence for the Eileen Chang story on which it is based? Is it a homage to films such as The Conformist? Or is it, exactly as the title says, a kind of mathematical theorem attempting to balance abandon and control in the human spirit? We know the Ang Lee story because the world insists on telling it: how the Taiwan kid came to the universities of Illinois and New York, met James Schamus as a working partner, and went from those exquisite films about the Taiwanese and food (The Wedding Banquet, Eat Drink Man Woman) to maybe the best Jane Austen film we have ever had (Sense and Sensibility). Such prowess leaves ample room for a &quot;failure&quot; like The Hulk, though in hindsight there may be something interesting in so complete a loss of touch. Lee has been industrious and pleasing in ways that make his work and its coherence seem easy or natural - and there is a risk that we admire the versatility and miss the lack of argument. The one thing that troubled me with Brokeback Mountain was that it seemed facile. If anything had been lost it was the sense in Proulx&apos;s language that the great adventure by the two cowboys was very hard for them. Lee is such a master of visual storytelling that sometimes he leaves the depth of his characters more indicated than revealed. Well, of course they&apos;re profound, he seems to suggest - aren&apos;t people profound? Well, yes, I hope so, but the reason I find Lust, Caution so impressive is that I&apos;m not sure Lee had come to a clear conclusion about his characters. Is this simply the story of a paranoid spy who is too intelligent for his pursuers? Or is it a story about a would-be killer who loses her way in the raptures of her own body? Is it even a film in which the obsession with sex finally eclipses political purpose? Is it a way of saying that anyone beset by both lust and caution is in a perilously self-denying situation? We are used to film-makers proceeding in their careers by trial and error, desperate to find the statue in the stone. Whereas Lee simply presents us with a new building with every film - and if The Hulk is a ruin, well, who is to say that a rounded city doesn&apos;t need ruins, too? But Lust, Caution was a film in which you could get lost, and I think I find that even more exciting than the customary experience with Lee of having the perfect map with the movie. All he needs to be a great master, I suspect, is a little more doubt and dismay."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/may/30/aceraspiremininotebookanoth", "publicationDate": "2008-05-30T11:38:19Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Technology", "Acer", "Asus"], "sentences": ["And it has naturally been expected to show something at Computex in Taiwan next week, since that&apos;s where Acer is based....."], "title": "Acer Aspire mini-notebook?

Alison Benjamin reports on a very real threat", "article": "Dave Hackenberg&apos;s bees have been on the road for four days. To reach the almond orchards of California&apos;s Central Valley, they pass through the fertile plains of the Mississippi, huge cattle ranches and oilfields in Texas, and the dusty towns of New Mexico on their 2,600-mile journey from Florida. The bees will have seen little of the dramatic landscape, being cooped up in hives stacked four high on the back of trucks. Each truck carries close to 500 hives, tethered with strong harnesses and covered with black netting to prevent the millions of passengers from escaping. When the drivers pull over to sleep, the bees have a break from the constant movement and wind speed, but there&apos;s no opportunity to look around and stretch their wings.  Their final destination is some two hours north of Los Angeles. As the sun begins to fade over the vast, flat terrain, the convoy slowly snakes through orchards filled with row upon row of almond trees stretching as far as the eye can see. Every February, the valley plays host to billions of honeybees as trees burst into blossom, blanketing the landscape in a soft, pinkish hue which extends to the horizon.  The sandy loam and Mediterranean climate are perfect for the cultivation of almonds, but that&apos;s where any comparisons to picturesque orchards of Spain or Italy end. Here, there are no verdant weeds, wild flowers or grass verges to please the eye, just never-ending trees that form what looks like an outdoor production line.  In the cool hours after sunset and before sunrise, more than one million hives are unloaded at regular intervals between the trees by commercial beekeepers such as Dave Hackenberg, who have travelled from the far corners of the US to take part in the world&apos;s largest managed pollination event. The mammoth orchards of Central Valley stretch the distance from London to Aberdeen, and the 60 million almond trees planted with monotonous uniformity along the 400-mile route require half of all the honeybees in the US to pollinate them - a staggering 40 billion.  By February 16, National Almond Day in the US, the trees are usually covered in flowers and humming with the sound of busy bees. Attracted by the sweet nectar that each flower offers, the bees crawl around on the petals to find the perfect sucking position. As they do so, their furry bodies are dusted with beads of pollen. As they fly from blossom to blossom in search of more of the sweet energy drink, they transfer pollen from the male part of the flower to the female part, and so fertilise it. Not long afterwards, the plant&apos;s ovaries swell into fruit, which by late August turn into precious, oval-shaped nuts. Without this army of migrant pollinators paying a visit for three weeks every year, the trees would fail to bear the almonds that are California&apos;s most valuable horticultural export. Last year, they earned the state more than $1.9bn, double the revenue from its Napa Valley vineyards. Moreover, 80% of the world&apos;s almonds now come from this pocket of the planet. But the supply of almonds in confectionery, cakes and packets of nuts is now threatened by a mysterious malady that is causing honeybees to disappear.  Hackenberg was the first beekeeper to report that his bees had vanished. On a November day 18 months ago, he checked the hives in his Florida bee yard to find they were empty. &quot;They weren&apos;t dead, they were just gone,&quot; he recalls.  Since then, close on two million colonies of honeybees across the US have been wiped out. The strange phenomenon, dubbed colony collapse disorder (CCD), is also thought to have claimed the lives of billions of honeybees around the world. In Taiwan, 10 million honeybees were reported to have disappeared in just two weeks, and throughout Europe honeybees are in peril.  In Britain, John Chapple was the first to raise the alarm. In January 2007, he lost all of the 14 colonies in his garden in west London. &quot;It&apos;s too cold at that time of year to open the hives,&quot; he says, &quot;so I always check on the bees by giving the hive a thump and waiting for what sounds like a roaring sound to come back. But there was nothing, just silence.&quot; When he opened the hives to see what had happened, he found them practically empty. Examination of a further 26 hives scattered across the capital revealed that two-thirds had perished.  &quot;I was completely shocked,&quot; says Chapple, who chairs the London Beekeepers&apos; Association. &quot;I could attribute some losses to a failing queen bee or wax moths, but there were a few I could find no reason for. There was a healthy queen and a few bees, but nothing else.&quot; Chapple&apos;s inquiries as to whether the parks where he kept some of his hives had sprayed new pesticides also drew a blank.  He was not alone. Beekeepers in north-west London also reported strange losses. Chapple calls the disappearance the &quot;Mary Celeste syndrome&quot;. A year later, a survey of hives by government bee inspectors across Britain has found that one in five colonies has perished this winter. There are some 270,000 honeybee hives in Britain run by 44,000 keepers, more than 90% of them amateurs. According to estimates by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), bees contribute \u00a3165m a year to the economy through their pollination of fruit trees, field beans and other crops. In addition, the 5,000 tonnes of British honey sold in UK stores generates a further \u00a312m. UK farming minister Lord Rooker, however, warned last year that honeybees are in acute danger: &quot;If nothing is done about it, the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years,&quot; he said. Last month, he launched a consultation on a national strategy to improve and protect honeybee health. People&apos;s initial response to the idea of a bee-less world is often either, &quot;That&apos;s a shame, I&apos;ll have no honey to spread on my toast&quot; or, &quot;Good - one less insect that can sting me.&quot; In fact, honeybees are vital for the pollination of around 90 crops worldwide. In addition to almonds, most fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds are dependent on honeybees. Crops that are used as cattle and pig feed also rely on honeybee pollination, as does the cotton plant. So if all the honeybees disappeared, we would have to switch our diet to cereals and grain, and give our wardrobes a drastic makeover. According to Albert Einstein, our very existence is inextricably linked to bees - he is reputed to have said: &quot;If the bee disappears off the surface of the globe, then man would only have four years of life left.&quot;  Bees are a barometer of what man is doing to the environment, say beekeepers; the canary in the coalmine. Just as animals behave weirdly before an earthquake or a hurricane, cowering in a corner or howling in the wind, so the silent, empty hives are a harbinger of a looming ecological crisis. But what is causing them to vanish - pesticides, parasites, pests, viruses? No one knows for sure. The more fanciful theories when CCD was first detected included an al-Qaida plot to wreck US agriculture, radiation from mobile phones and even celestial intervention in the form of honeybee rapture. Scientists around the world are trying to pinpoint the culprit, but it is proving elusive. They have even set up an international network to monitor honeybee losses - a sort of Interpol for bees - which is operating out of Switzerland. Its coordinator, bee pathologist Dr Peter Neumann, blames a bloodsucking mite called varroa. Little bigger than a pinhead, it has preyed on honeybees in Europe and the US since its arrival 30 years ago. Under a microscope, the reddish-brown mite looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a Frisbee. It activates lethal viruses in honeybees and carries them from bee to bee when it feeds on their blood, like a dirty syringe spreading HIV/Aids. &quot;It has to be the backbone of the problem,&quot; Neumann says. &quot;But it is probably not acting alone.&quot; In the US, where the genetic code of the honeybee was unravelled by scientists two years ago, they have been employing advanced technology to discover if a new virus is responsible for killing the bees. Genome sequencing techniques uncovered the DNA of a virus called Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) that was found in almost all of the hives suffering from CCD. The discovery, published in Science, was hailed as a major breakthrough in the investigation. But honeybees are riddled with latent viruses. They become a problem and cause disease only when the bee&apos;s immune system is shot. Like humans, they are prone to illness when they are stressed and run-down. So the real question is, what is making the bees too weak to fight a virus? The answer is probably overwork, coupled with various environmental factors that are the flipside of pollination on an industrial scale and intensified food production. After Hackenberg&apos;s bees have pollinated the almonds in California, they head north to the apple orchards of Washington State, then east for the cranberries and pumpkins, before reaching Maine in May to pollinate blueberries. In a year, they can cover 11,000 miles. It&apos;s a well-worn route that&apos;s travelled by many of the 1,000 commercial beekeepers in America who between them own 90% of the country&apos;s 2.4 million honeybee colonies. It is pollination, rather than honey production, that keeps US beekeepers in business. In 2007, honey production was worth $160m to the US economy, compared with pollination services that have been estimated at $15bn. Joe Traynor is a California bee broker. From a small office in a quiet side street in downtown Bakersfield, on the southern tip of Central Valley, he runs a lucrative business matching almond growers with beekeepers. I put to him that surely all this moving around of bees, confined to their hives for long periods, must be stressful for them. He admits that too much travel is not good for their health: &quot;When you&apos;re trucking bees, they need sleep, just as humans do, and the bumping around in the truck for two to three days keeps them awake, and this lowers their resistance to pests and disease.&quot; Hackenberg, however, disagrees: &quot;I&apos;ve been doing this 40-odd years. We&apos;ve done all the same things, but the rules have changed. Something&apos;s messing up.&quot;  Hackenberg, 59, wears cowboy boots, a checked shirt and blue jeans. He even has a hard hat in the shape of a Stetson, with netting attached that he wears when unloading beehives. He began his own investigations into what killed 2,000 of his honeybees at the end of 2006, by talking to growers and reading up on pesticide use and research into their effects on bees. &quot;It&apos;s those new neonicotinoid pesticides that growers are using,&quot; he says. &quot;That&apos;s what&apos;s messing up the bees&apos; navigation system so they can&apos;t find their way home.&quot;  Honeybees have a sophisticated dance language they use to communicate with each other in the hive. Until Karl von Frisch unlocked the mysteries of this dance - his discovery won him a Nobel prize in 1973 - we didn&apos;t fully appreciate that bees returning to the hive laden with nectar and pollen will tell their sisters (all worker bees are female) where they got their supplies by doing a dance that points to the location of the flowers in relation to the sun&apos;s position. Tests have shown that the pesticides Hackenberg refers to can interfere with the bees&apos; communication and orientation skills, and also impair memory. With innocuous brand names such as Gaucho, Assail and Merit, these pesticides are used worldwide, from sunflower fields to apple orchards, lawns to golf courses. The chemicals they contain are an artificial type of nicotine that acts as a neurotoxin that attacks insects&apos; nervous systems on contact or ingestion. Because it is systemic, the chemical moves throughout a plant, so if it is applied as a seed dressing, it will travel to the shoots, stem, leaves and flowers where bees can come into contact with small doses. Many of these widely used pesticides are classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency as &quot;highly toxic to bees&quot; and come with a warning label intended to help prevent their exposure to the pollinators.  &quot;It&apos;s in such small print that the growers don&apos;t see it,&quot; Hackenberg says. He accuses farmers of &quot;stacking&quot; - or mixing - pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. &quot;No one has ever tested what happens to the toxicity if they do mix, simply because the chemical companies are not required to by law, but this combination could be a thousand times more lethal than if the chemicals are applied separately.&quot; In Britain, beekeeping is very small-scale compared with the US. There are a few hundred professional beekeepers, who run an average of 100 hives each; only around 50 of them transport bees to orchards, usually over distances of 25 or so miles, rather than across a continent. Many orchards provide a year-round home for hives kept by amateur beekeepers, so there is no need for migratory beekeepers. But in this country, as in the rest of Europe, it is hard to escape pesticides and the varroa mite. In France, beekeepers have for more than a decade waged a war against the chemical giant Bayer CropScience. They hold responsible the company&apos;s bestselling pesticide, imidacloprid, trade name Gaucho, for killing a third of the country&apos;s 1.5 million colonies. In 1999, the French government banned the use of Gaucho on sunflower crops after thousands took to the streets in protest. Two further pesticides were banned because of their potential link to bee deaths. It appeared to stem the massive bee die-offs for a time, even though the manufacturers&apos; own tests demonstrated there is no correlation, and a long-term study by the French food safety agency revealed no significant differences in death rates before and after pesticides were banned. This winter, bee deaths across France are reported to have shot up again to 60%.  Bayer is also being blamed by German beekeepers for the eerie silence along the Rhine valley, where the buzzing of bees is a common sound at this time of year. They say two-thirds of honeybees have been killed this month by the pesticide clothianidin, sold under the trade name Poncho, which has been widely applied on sweet corn. As a result of the bee deaths, eight pesticides, including clothianidin, have been temporarily suspended in Germany. Anecdotal evidence of pesticide-related bee deaths in Italy and Holland is also piling up.  European beekeepers accuse scientists and government agencies of being in the pocket of the chemical companies. It&apos;s a similar story in the US, where scientists maintain that there is no correlation between the bees&apos; disappearance and pesticide use. According to Hackenberg: &quot;Big Ag has control of the USDA [the US Department of Agriculture] from the secretary right down to the lowest guy on the totem pole.&quot; Jeff Pettis is not sure where he comes on the pole. The senior manager at the federal bee laboratory in Maryland, he&apos;s the man responsible for coordinating the US government&apos;s response to CCD. Pettis advises some beekeepers may do well to forgo the almond pollination and rest their bees. &quot;You are getting them ready for February when the sunlight hours and the temperature are telling them it&apos;s too early in the year to be foraging at full strength,&quot; he says.  Deceiving bees is an essential part of the business. Beekeepers dupe them into thinking it&apos;s already summer by moving them to warm locations in winter and feeding them an array of protein and energy supplements. The more food that comes into the hive, the more eggs the queen lays, to create more of the worker bees to go out and pollinate.  The bee broker Joe Traynor says the deception goes much further than trucking bees south. &quot;We&apos;re interfering with their natural cycle because we want strong colonies for almond pollination. We&apos;re stimulating hives in August, September and October, and making the queens do a lot more laying. As a result the queens are suffering burnout. It used to be that a beekeeper could pretty much leave his bees alone during winter. That&apos;s no longer the case.&quot; Moreover, scientists funded by the Almond Board of California are now experimenting with artificial pheromones that trick bees into thinking there are more larvae in the hive that need feeding, so they forage more, and in the process pollinate more almond blossom. This is the Almond Board&apos;s profit-driven response to a potential shortfall of honeybees: to work even harder those that remain. Bees are being treated as a machine with no consideration for their life cycle and downtimes. And any machine pushed to its limits and not well maintained will break. Environmentalists argue for conservation measures on land planted with single crops that will both improve honeybee nutrition and attract wild pollinators that could shoulder some of the honeybees&apos; workload. Monoculture, the hallmark of modern agriculture, covers much of the world&apos;s 1.5bn hectares of arable land. Single-crop plantations and orchards can stretch for hundreds of kilometres. The advantages for the farmer are manifold: the crop blooms at the same time, can be treated with the same pesticides and can be harvested together for maximum efficiency. But for honeybees, pollen collected from one crop does not provide a balanced, nutritious diet. Scientists agree that malnourished bees are more susceptible to disease and pesticide poisoning, while the best-fed are the hardiest.  Planting hedgerows of wild flowers would give honeybees a more varied menu. While this has happened in Europe, US almond growers have proved resistant to the idea, concerned that the bees would make fewer visits to the almond blossom if they had a choice. But hedgerows would also provide food and habitat for other pollinators such as butterflies, bumblebees and solitary bees. There are 4,500 wild bee species in North America that are capable of pollinating myriad fruits and vegetables - some more efficiently than honeybees.  Could they prevent a pollination crisis if honeybees become extinct? Only if they have somewhere to make a home in the orchards and fields, and something to eat after the single crop has bloomed. Monoculture deprives them on both counts.  The Xerces Society runs a pollinator conservation project in northern California. Farms in Yolo County receive a mixture of plants that flower throughout the year and nest blocks for wild bees, and they keep large areas of soil untilled for native bees to live on. They say they have seen the return of native bees and benefited from their pollination services. But final details being hammered out in a farm bill on Capitol Hill look like trimming conservation budgets and reducing financial incentives for farmers to manage their land in a more pollinator-friendly way.  So growers will continue to be increasingly reliant on honeybees to do a job once performed by a host of different insects. Their profits now hinge as much on honeybees&apos; availability to pollinate fields as they do on the sun and rain. This is why there is such urgency in solving the mystery of disappearing and dying bees. This is not the first time that honeybees have disappeared. The first recorded unexplained loss was in the US 150 years ago and ever since large numbers have vanished at intervals throughout North America, Europe and Australia. An epidemic first reported on the Isle of Wight wiped out 90% of honeybee colonies in the UK at the beginning of the 20th century. Then, as now, the main suspects were deficiencies in the bees&apos; diet, pollution in the environment, pests and parasites and mismanagement by beekeepers, but the killer was never identified. When bees die, beekeepers can restock their hives quickly by buying a new queen who lays 2,000 eggs a day at her peak. Across the world, most have chosen to fill their apiaries with a type of honeybee renowned for its gentle nature and prodigious honey production skills. This race of bee, originally from Italy, now dominates beekeeping. The downside is that the honeybee gene pool has been diminished and with it traits that may have helped bees fend off mites and other parasites, such as a new fungal bacteria, Nosema ceranae, that attacks its gut. There are fears that mites are becoming increasingly resistant to chemicals administered by beekeepers to kill them. Pettis says we are controlling too many bee ailments with drugs and a more organic approach is needed that includes stocking apiaries with locally reared bees better adapted to local climate and environmental conditions. Meanwhile scientists are hoping to use the mapping of the honeybee genome to engineer in the laboratory a super bee that has the resilience to withstand varroa but retains all the qualities of the Italian bee. Biologists will tell you, however, that it will be only a matter of time before a super bee breeds a super parasite. Geneticists also discovered that honeybees have fewer genes providing resistance to disease than other insects. In particular, the number of genes responsible for detoxification appear to be smaller, making it unusually sensitive to pesticides and poisons. Its large-scale disappearance across the US and high death rates in Europe are signalling that industrialised farming makes demands on honeybees that are not sustainable.  Central Valley has been described as a big brothel where billions of honeybees from all over the US can pick up a contagious illness and take it home. It&apos;s spread by mites from infected to healthy colonies. And there are plans to expand Central Valley&apos;s almond orchards to the point where, by 2011, they will require 1.6 million honeybee colonies for pollination.  Despite around a third of all US honeybees being wiped out last year, and again this year after beekeepers had restocked their hives, the almond pollination has yet to suffer. Why? There are two answers. The shortage of honeybees has pushed up the price of hive rentals for almond pollination to an all-time high of $140 per hive, so more and more beekeepers are making the trip west, and the Almond Board&apos;s requirement of two hives each containing 20,000-30,000 bees per acre to pollinate the almonds is excessive, but provides a buffer should some of the hives be empty. As the sun rises over the almond orchards after another nocturnal delivery of east coast hives, Hackenberg says it&apos;s only the money that brings him and his waning bees to California each year. &quot;I&apos;d rather be back in Florida with my bees. They&apos;d be feeding on the maple and willow. It&apos;s paradise down there. Why would anyone come to this godforsaken place? But something&apos;s got to pay the bills.

I&apos;ve spent the last three nights watching a nine-hour Chinese opera called The Peony Pavilion, and its combination of unearthly beauty, dream-like plot and siren-like singing are making my trip feel ... trippy. I&apos;m on scarcely more solid ground during the day. This newly globalised city, awaiting the start of the Olympics, seems to be almost palpably churning: all around it is being demolished, redesigned and rebuilt. The city seems to be sprinting towards its future. What place can a 400-year-old opera have in that? The Peony Pavilion, which is being staged in London this week, is an opera on an epic scale. Written by the poet Tang Xianzu in 1598, it tells the story of a girl who makes love to a young scholar in a dream, beginning an erotic liaison that sees her die and be brought back to life. The opera is the best-known example of a style called kunqu, which originated in the southern region of Suzhou during the late Ming era (1368-1644). It was highbrow, aristocratic entertainment. Each production, played out over several evenings, was highly codified, with elaborate makeup, fabulously embroidered costumes and music that combined stylised speech-singing with arias that swooped between piercing falsetto and rumbling bass. Over the next three centuries, kunqu opera gave way to the more populist Peking opera, but it remained prized by the Chinese literati for its refined style - until the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, when kunqu was suppressed as a decadent, imperialist tradition. I&apos;ve been watching The Peony Pavilion at Beijing&apos;s National Centre for Performing Arts, a futuristic glass and titanium dome. Later, I meet its producer, Kenneth Pai, there. A dapper, mild-mannered man of 70, he recalls his first encounter with the opera at the age of nine. &quot;I think it was fate,&quot; he says. &quot;The great actor Mei Lan-fang was performing in Shanghai. It was a big sensation and our family were lucky to get tickets. And on the night we went he happened to perform a scene from The Peony Pavilion called The Interrupted Dream.&quot; Pai&apos;s eyes widen until I can almost see the goggle-eyed kid he was then. &quot;I didn&apos;t know what it was. I didn&apos;t understand it. But it haunted me.&quot; Soon after this, China&apos;s history took a fateful turn: Pai went into exile, and kunqu opera went underground. His father was a minister in the nationalist Kuomintang party and settled in Taiwan after their defeat by the communists in 1949. It was there, studying literature at university, that Pai came across the poetry of Tang Xianzu once more. As one of Taiwan&apos;s foremost writers, Pai returned again and again to The Peony Pavilion. One of the stories in his most famous book, Taipei People (1971), was inspired by the opera. He then turned this into a stage play in 1982, and, a year later, co-produced two acts of the original opera in Taipei. The crucial moment came in 1987, when Pai returned to China for the first time in 39 years to see a kunqu opera company perform in Shanghai. &quot;I was overwhelmed,&quot; he remembers, &quot;jumping and clapping even after other people had left.&quot; The actors told Pai how they had kept kunqu alive. &quot;During the Cultural Revolution the performers were sent out all over China for labour reform,&quot; Pai says. &quot;They were not allowed to sing kunqu. It was strictly forbidden. But when they were out working in the fields, they told me they would sing to themselves quietly, just to remember the music, so that they could keep kunqu alive. That is how, after 10 years of this Cultural Revolution - cultural holocaust, I could even say - they could come back and work together again. And I thought, if they could do this, I must help them. If this art form has survived the Cultural Revolution, it must go on.&quot; Pai dreamed of staging his own large-scale kunqu opera production. A three-hour show in Taipei in 1992 served as a practice run, but by the opera&apos;s 400th anniversary in 1998, his project still had not got off the ground. Meanwhile, others had completed theirs. The director Peter Sellars opened the 1998 Vienna festival with a &quot;postmodern&quot; Peony, mixing classical and contemporary music, stage scenery and video screens. Another production, by Chen Shi-Zheng for the Shanghai Kunqu Company, was due to open New York&apos;s Lincoln Centre festival the same year, but was cancelled by the Chinese authorities, who deemed it feudalistic, superstitious and pornographic. The Lincoln Centre mounted Chen&apos;s production the following year, with mostly New York-based artists. It was an 18-hour marathon, complete with a pond and live ducks, including all the opera&apos;s original 55 scenes, and marketed as the revival of a lost Ming tradition. &quot;It was a very exciting production,&quot; says Pai. &quot;But it mixed a whole variety of styles - Peking opera, puppetry, folklore. It wasn&apos;t kunqu.&quot; Meanwhile, the Shanghai Kunqu Company mounted its own lavish version, billed as an &quot;uncut original&quot;, although it included only 35 scenes. &quot;That was kunqu style,&quot; says Pai, &quot;though the set was too much like a theatre stage - with real willow trees, for example - where the real aesthetic of kunqu is more abstract and lyrical.&quot; Other critics were less diplomatic, describing it as gaudy and excessive. Pai remained determined to stage a version that could look to China&apos;s future, while staying true to its past. &quot;But the masters were ageing. And the audience was ageing, too. I had to do something quick.&quot; He began to focus on the new generation, getting two kunqu masters to work with a group of young actors in the Suzhou Opera Company and creating what he calls the &quot;Young Lovers&apos; Edition&quot; of the opera, with the music and staging both lightly modernised. &quot;It was rigorous training,&quot; he says. &quot;I put them through hell!&quot; The production first toured Chinese universities, with tickets either cheap or free. For Pai, these young people were his real audience, rather than the officials with complimentary tickets at the National Centre for Performing Arts, who (and I can vouch for this) nattered on their mobiles throughout the performance. &quot;It was phenomenal,&quot; says Pai. &quot;Thousands of people turned out and sat through nine hours. Why? I have a feeling that this young generation are searching for their cultural identity. They open their eyes and see here a McDonald&apos;s, there a Kentucky Fried Chicken. They are inundated with western influences, but globalisation makes them even more aware of being Chinese. The question is, how to be Chinese? They want to identify with their cultural traditions - but they can&apos;t find them. So this opera is at once familiar and very fresh. They can see it comes from an old Chinese tradition, yet it&apos;s also new for them.&quot;  \u00b7 The Peony Pavilion is at Sadler&apos;s Wells, London EC1 (0844 412 4300) from today until Sunday"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/jun/03/thearmsraceinspace", "publicationDate": "2008-06-03T10:33:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "US news", "Space", "Technology", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Last month, Brigadier General Jeffrey Horne, from the US Strategic Command, told a congessional advisory group that China was &quot;aggressively&quot; developing its ability to shoot down satellites, technology he predicted could be used in a future showdown over Taiwan."], "title": "China and the arms race in space", "article": "Outside scrutiny of China has, understandably, been muted in the weeks following the Sichuan earthquake.

Strategic confrontation in outer space is difficult to avoid. The development of outer space forces shows signs that a space arms race to seize the commanding heights is emerging.  Beijing remains officially set on drawing up secure multinational regulations to avoid a space arms race, but is clearly hedging its bets - something Washington is only too aware of.

The air force chief of staff, General Michael Moseley, and civilian secretary Michael Wynne were asked to resign by senior Pentagon officials in advance of a report that is expected to pass embarrassing judgment on the nuclear errors.  The resignations had been expected amid simmering tension between the defence secretary, Robert Gates, and air force leaders. Gates has blasted the air force as not fully committed to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, urging it to send more of the unmanned planes known as Predators into the war. &quot;Because people were stuck in old ways of doing business, it&apos;s been like pulling teeth,&quot; Gates said in a speech this spring to the air force academy. Yet the deciding factor in the military shakeup appears to be two nuclear slip-ups by the air force, which Moseley and Wynne have led since 2005. The air force admitted in March to sending Taiwan nuclear fuses that it believed were helicopter batteries, a gaffe that one senior defence official called &quot;disconcerting&quot;. A bigger mistake came 10 months ago, when six nuclear missiles were flown from North Dakota to Louisiana without any of the air force officials on board knowing about their hazardous cargo. The incident was deemed so serious that President George Bush was immediately notified. The air force unit that flew the six missiles failed a safety inspection only last month, according to the Washington Post. Moseley was also reprimanded by Pentagon auditors in April for pushing ethical boundaries in his friendship with two private contractors who won a $50m (\u00a326m) contract in 2005 to produce flight shows for the air force. The Pentagon inspector general found in April that the contract to promote the Thunderbirds aerial stunt team was tainted by improper influence and preferential treatment. No criminal conduct was found.  Moseley was not singled out for blame, but the investigation laid out a trail of communications from him and other air force leaders that eventually influenced the awarding of the contract. Included in that were friendly emails between Moseley and an executive in the company that won the bid.  &quot;It is my sense that General Moseley&apos;s command authority has been compromised,&quot; Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat on the Senate armed services committee, said at the time.  Replacements for the two leaders were not immediately announced. Forcing out both the uniformed and civilian chiefs of a military service is a rare move, but Gates sacked the army secretary last year amid a scandal over the mistreatment of injured soldiers at the Walter Reed hospital in Washington.

Up to 200 French hauliers gridlocked Bordeaux with a go-slow convey that caused nearly 20 miles of tailbacks in and around the city. Outside Lille farmers on tractors staged protests, and around 500 farmers converged on Toulouse for a demonstration.  In Portugal lorry drivers also launched an open-ended strike, and one group threatened to block main roads running south to the Algarve to prevent goods reaching the tourist region. Trucks that broke picket lines had their windscreens smashed.  J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cordier of Unostra, the French union of small and medium haulage companies, said yesterday&apos;s protests marked a new phase to coordinate strikes across Europe for maximum impact, a development that could threaten widespread disruption during the holiday season. &quot;We&apos;re taking this up a gear and focusing on the European dimension,&quot; he said. France will be hit by open-ended actions next Monday, when three haulage unions join forces for the first time. In Italy lorry drivers are preparing for an all-out strike between June 30 and July 4. In Britain around 300 lorries are expected to converge on central London on July 2 for TransAction&apos;s campaign for European parity on fuel duty and road fuel prices, and the Road Haulage Association could hold its planned mass rally at the same time. Unions for small haulage firms from seven EU states, including France, the Netherlands, Hungary and Slovenia, will meet in Brussels this week to coordinate action, hoping to force EU governments to level out taxes and prices. Amid expert warnings that the price of oil will remain high for years to come, soaring to perhaps $200 a barrel, a summit of the EU&apos;s 27 heads of government next week will reject short-term solutions such as the cap on VAT on fuel proposed by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy. But, with surging food and fuel prices dominating their agenda, they will encourage national governments to adopt measures to cushion their impact on the poor and most vulnerable - for a limited period. A chorus of ministers, diplomats and officials said fiscal measures would send the wrong signals to people that they could carry on consuming as before - and to oil producers that it did not matter how high prices went. &quot;Any subsidies or tax-cuts would simply divert even more money to oil-exporting countries,&quot; Joaqu\u00edn Almunia, the EU economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said. The Spanish government said it would announce measures tomorrow to ease the strain of fuel price rises, in the hope of reaching a deal with lorry drivers by midweek. The measures included allowing hauliers to make financially favourable changes to their contracts during times of economic hardship. The government would also give \u20ac55m (about \u00a343.6m) in aid to drivers who wanted to retire early.  The strikes come after three weeks of fuel protests that have blockaded fishing ports. Some Spanish and Italian fishermen remained in port yesterday, while in France Mediterranean ports reopened as fishermen suspended their strike until a meeting of ministers in Brussels on June 23.

A succession of developing countries have provoked public outcry by ordering fuel price increases. Yesterday Indian police forcibly dispersed hundreds of protesters in Kashmir who were angry at a 10% rise introduced last week. Protests appeared likely to spread to neighbouring Nepal after its government yesterday announced a 25% rise in fuel prices. Truckers in South Korea have vowed strike action over the high cost of diesel. Taiwan, Sri Lanka and Indonesia have all raised pump prices. Malaysia&apos;s decision last week to increase prices generated such public fury that the government moved yesterday to trim ministers&apos; allowances to appease the public."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/10/food.globaleconomy", "publicationDate": "2008-06-09T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Food", "Global economy", "Business", "United Nations", "World news", "Environment", "Farming"], "sentences": ["The economic miracles in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan arose from their land reform programmes."], "title": "George Monbiot: These objects of contempt are now our best chance of feeding the world", "article": "I suggest you sit down before you read this. Robert Mugabe is right. At last week&apos;s global food summit he was the only leader to speak of &quot;the importance of land in agricultural production and food security&quot;. Countries should follow Zimbabwe&apos;s lead, he said, in democratising ownership.  Of course the old bastard has done just the opposite. He has evicted his opponents and given land to his supporters. He has failed to support the new settlements with credit or expertise, with the result that farming in Zimbabwe has collapsed. The country was in desperate need of land reform when Mugabe became president. It remains in desperate need of land reform today.  But he is right in theory. Though the rich world&apos;s governments won&apos;t hear it, the issue of whether or not the world will be fed is partly a function of ownership. This reflects an unexpected discovery. It was first made in 1962 by the Nobel economist Amartya Sen, and has since been confirmed by dozens of studies. There is an inverse relationship between the size of farms and the amount of crops they produce per hectare. The smaller they are, the greater the yield.  In some cases, the difference is enormous. A recent study of farming in Turkey, for example, found that farms of less than one hectare are 20 times as productive as farms of more than 10 hectares. Sen&apos;s observation has been tested in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Malaysia, Thailand, Java, the Philippines, Brazil, Colombia and Paraguay. It appears to hold almost everywhere.  The finding would be surprising in any industry, as we have come to associate efficiency with scale. In farming it seems particularly odd, because small producers are less likely to own machinery, less likely to have capital or access to credit, and less likely to know about the latest techniques.  There&apos;s a good deal of controversy about why this relationship exists. Some researchers argued that it was the result of a statistical artefact: fertile soils support higher populations than barren lands, so farm size could be a result of productivity, rather than the other way around. But further studies have shown that the inverse relationship holds across an area of fertile land. Moreover, it works even in countries such as Brazil, where the biggest farmers have grabbed the best land. The most plausible explanation is that small farmers use more labour per hectare than big farmers. Their workforce largely consists of members of their own families, which means that labour costs are lower than on large farms (they don&apos;t have to spend money recruiting or supervising workers), while the quality of the work is higher. With more labour, farmers can cultivate their land more intensively: they spend more time terracing and building irrigation systems; they sow again immediately after the harvest; and they might grow several crops in the same field.  In the early days of the green revolution, this relationship seemed to go into reverse: the bigger farms, with access to credit, were able to invest in new varieties and boost their yields. But as the new varieties have spread to smaller farmers, the inverse relationship has reasserted itself. If governments are serious about feeding the world, they should be breaking up large landholdings, redistributing them to the poor and concentrating their research and their funding on supporting small farms.  There are plenty of other reasons for defending small farmers in poor countries. The economic miracles in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan arose from their land reform programmes. Peasant farmers used the cash they made to build small businesses. The same thing seems to have happened in China, though it was delayed for 40 years by collectivisation and the Great Leap Backwards: the economic benefits of the redistribution that began in 1949 were not felt until the early 80s. Growth based on small farms tends to be more equitable than growth built around capital-intensive industries. Though their land is used intensively, the total ecological impact of smallholdings is lower. When small farms are bought up by big ones, the displaced workers move into new land to try to scratch out a living. I once followed evicted peasants from the Brazilian state of Maranh\u00e3o 2,000 miles across the Amazon to the land of the Yanomami people, then watched them rip it apart. But the prejudice against small farmers is unchallengeable. It gives rise to the oddest insult in the English language: when you call someone a peasant, you are accusing them of being self-reliant and productive. Peasants are detested by capitalists and communists alike. Both have sought to seize peasants&apos; land, and have a powerful vested interest in demeaning and demonising them. In its profile of Turkey, the country whose small farmers are 20 times more productive than its large ones, the UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation states that, as a result of small landholdings, &quot;farm output ... remains low&quot;. The OECD states: &quot;Stopping land fragmentation ... and consolidating the highly fragmented land is indispensable for raising agricultural productivity.&quot; Neither body provides any supporting evidence. A rootless, half-starved labouring class suits capital very well. Like Mugabe, the donor countries and the big international bodies loudly demand that small farmers be supported, while quietly shafting them. Last week&apos;s Rome food summit agreed &quot;to help farmers, particularly small-scale producers, increase production and integrate with local, regional, and international markets&quot;. But when, earlier this year, the International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge proposed a means of doing just this, the US, Australia and Canada refused to endorse it as it offended big business, while the United Kingdom remains the only country that won&apos;t reveal whether or not it supports the study.  Big business is killing small farming. By extending intellectual property rights over every aspect of production, and by developing plants that either won&apos;t breed true or don&apos;t reproduce at all, big business ensures that only those with access to capital can cultivate. As it captures both the wholesale and retail markets, it seeks to reduce its transaction costs by engaging only with major sellers. If you think that supermarkets are giving farmers in the UK a hard time, you should see what they are doing to growers in the poor world. As developing countries sweep away street markets and hawkers&apos; stalls and replace them with superstores and glossy malls, the most productive farmers lose their customers and are forced to sell up. The rich nations support this process by demanding access for their companies. Their agricultural subsidies still help their own large farmers to compete unfairly with the small producers of the poor world.  This leads to an interesting conclusion. For many years, well-meaning liberals have supported the fair trade movement because of the benefits it delivers directly to the people it buys from. But the structure of the global food market is changing so rapidly that fair trade is now becoming one of the few means by which small farmers in poor nations might survive. A shift from small to large farms will cause a major decline in global production, just as food supplies become tight. Fair trade might now be necessary not only as a means of redistributing income, but also to feed the world. \u00b7 monbiot.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/11/internationalaidanddevelopment.news", "publicationDate": "2008-06-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Global development", "Technology", "Society"], "sentences": ["Asus of Taiwan has shown the way by selling a million of its Eee range of PCs starting at \u00a3190."], "title": "Editorial: In praise of ... cheap laptops", "article": "It is one of the most extraordinary business stories of recent memory.

The decisive arrival of the current food crisis must be making them feel even more righteous. As daily news reports now remind us, there are three key factors behind the rocketing price of the most basic foodstuffs: the rising cost of oil, swathes of agricultural land being given over to biofuels, and the fact that the increasing affluence of China and India is spearheading an explosion in the demand for meat and the feed needed to produce it.  From there, it is only a small step towards an argument that is rapidly gaining ground: that with more than 850 million people going hungry, using huge amounts of water, grain, energy and land to rear livestock is a luxury now officially beyond us. This may suggest the arrogant west once again telling the rest of humanity to refrain from what we have happily done for years, but there is another way of thinking about it: \u00e0 la the contraction and convergence model for tackling climate change, if we are to accommodate other countries&apos; increased demand for meat, we will have to drastically reduce our own.  As the Alcoholics Anonymous mantra would have it: my name is John Harris and I am a vegetarian. I haven&apos;t eaten meat or fish since Christmas 1984, when I had my share of the Christmas turkey, and then quit. I can faintly recall arguments about the inbuilt inefficiencies of meat-eating, but the decision of this particular hard-bitten 14-year-old was based on two different considerations: first, a belief that it was wrong to kill sentient creatures to eat them; and second, that living without meat was an integral part of the 80s counterculture that set itself against the adult world, international capitalism, and Margaret Thatcher. With the arrival of the Smiths&apos; album Meat Is Murder in 1985, everything became clear. If only for reasons of space, we&apos;ll have to leave vegans out of this - but in the intervening 20-odd years, it&apos;s been strange to watch vegetarianism ooze so easily into the culture. The great post-PC backlash that began in the mid-1990s seemed to briefly threaten its quiet ascendancy - but though avowed British herbivores still form a pretty tiny minority (between 2% and 8% of us, according to polling), their influence is obvious. The recent story of British meat consumption may essentially be one of fish, chicken and processed meat supplanting our appetite for beef, pork and lamb straight from the butcher&apos;s block, but the parallel growth of vegetarian food has been astonishing: after well over a decade of year-on-year surges, the research firm Mintel reckons that the annual value of the British &quot;meat-free&quot; market is about to reach \u00a3780m. In the midst of such progress, there has only been one drawback: the ongoing and inevitable association of vegetarianism with a very British piety (with the onset of age, one begins to understand Orwell&apos;s very reasonable distaste for the people he described as &quot;vegetarians and communists&quot;), and the mixed-up morals of the hardcore animal rights lobby. In 1999, I went to see Morrissey in concert, and heard him compare the meat industry&apos;s transgressions with slavery and the Nazi genocide; down the years, I&apos;ve regularly confronted the assumption that refusing meat and fish somehow puts you in tight alliance with the people who seem to think that medical vivisection is a bigger problem than, say, human hunger. Now, thankfully, there comes this new vegetarian(ish) agenda, and the chance to make the case against meat-eating on more level-headed grounds: that even if meat will remain part of most people&apos;s diet, they are going to have to eat less of it; and that right now, this is actually more about human lives than those of animals. Newsnight recently ran an item on the arguments for cutting down, stuffed with the requisite statistics; for example, whereas it takes 20.9 square metres of land to produce 1kg of beef, to come up with the same weight of vegetables, the figure is 0.3 square metres. In the ensuing studio discussion, even the pro-meat contributor agreed that the world would now &quot;have to value meat more highly&quot;, and Gavin Esler enthusiastically quizzed the vegetarian advocate, rather than trying to tear him to bits. By the end, one got the impression that they were discussing something almost unanswerable. In the short-to-medium-term, it may well be the price of meat rather than high-minded ethics that sends sales of Quorn through the roof. Nonetheless, something is up: the possibility of a decisive sea-change that, back in the days of Smiths albums and endless lentils, would have been unimaginable. Millions of Britons following the Taiwanese and pledging en masse to go herbivorous may seem unlikely - but then again, I wouldn&apos;t rule it out. john.harris@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jun/19/conservatives.houseofcommons", "publicationDate": "2008-06-18T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Conservatives", "House of Commons", "Politics"], "sentences": ["She points out that both of them are very busy, chairing committees in parliament and travelling - citing a visit together to Taiwan."], "title": "Tory couple told to stop claiming allowance on flat", "article": "By the House of Commons rulebook Sir Nicholas and Lady Winterton, the husband and wife team who represent adjoining Cheshire seats, have done nothing wrong. Like nearly all other MPs they have to maintain two homes, one in their constituency and one near Westminster. Like everyone else they also can claim from the taxpayer all the rent or mortgage interest payments on their London home. But there the similarities end. For the husband and wife Tory MPs used thousands of pounds of taxpayers&apos; money to rent a London flat, even though they had already paid off the mortgage. A report by the Commons standards and privileges committee yesterday confirmed that in the past six years they had claimed just under \u00a3130,000 in expenses to cover rent which was then paid to a family trust for which they were trustees and their children the beneficiaries. The couple set up the trust and then as trustees rented the \u00a3700,000 Westminster flat to themselves under a scheme to avoid inheritance tax to benefit their own children. Sir Nicholas and Lady Winterton bought the flat in Rowan Court in Belgravia&apos;s Greycoat Street in the early 1990s with a \u00a3195,000 mortgage from the Cheshire Building Society and charged most of the \u00a32,841 a month payment to the taxpayer. A legacy and an insurance policy enabled them to buy the flat outright in 2002. But their solicitors and financial advisers proposed setting up a trust to run the property with the aim of avoiding \u00a3280,000 in inheritance tax by leaving it to their children. The couple became trustees of the property and decided to charge themselves \u00a321,600 a year in rent and claim all the money back from the taxpayer. The standards and privileges committee report published yesterday reveals that at the time this was acceptable within the rules that governed MPs&apos; expenses. The committee said the couple were &quot;arguably&quot; in breach of the rules following changes to expenses rules in 2003, which banned MPs from using their Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) to rent from themselves. But the position was &quot;unequivocal&quot; following further changes to regulations in July 2006, because they and their children had an interest in the trust. &quot;In our view the Wintertons have been in breach of the rules applying to the ACA since July 2006, a fact of which they were made officially aware in February 2007.&quot; Now they have been given until September 1 to move out and lose all allowances on the property, because what they have been doing has broken revised rules for the last two years. As the report says: &quot;The Wintertons will by then have benefited from what amounts to a grace period of two years, which in our view is, in all the circumstances, more than adequate.&quot; It also warns them: &quot;Members should themselves interpret the spirit as well as the letter of the rules, mindful of the purpose, which is to protect the reputation of the House and its members generally.&quot; The two MPs blame the parliamentary authorities for not telling them they fell foul of the rule change and have also strongly objected to the investigation. Lady Winterton, in a letter to John Lyon, the parliamentary commissioner, condemned the two people who complained about them - Michael Barnbrook and Gary Poole, who is the Labour candidate standing against her at the next general election - as &quot;vexatious&quot;. She says Poole&apos;s complaint is &quot;motivated entirely by party political opportunism&quot;. The House of Commons Resources Department, which paid them the money for the flat, is severely criticised. Lady Winterton wrote: &quot;Whereas once the department provided an exemplary service to MPs, this appears no longer to be the case and perhaps we have been let down by our expectation that it still existed.&quot; This is rejected by MPs in their report. She also blames the department for the leak that led to the claims becoming public in February this year. She claims the department has been &quot;infiltrated&quot; and details passed to the press. She wrote: &quot;We have been placed in an impossible position with our names being dragged through the press in a most damaging and horrific way, with our integrity being challenged and yet without being able to counter this appalling, unjustified onslaught.&quot; Later she complains that the inquiry should have been finished since both of them had agreed to move out but needed time to find an alternative flat. She points out that both of them are very busy, chairing committees in parliament and travelling - citing a visit together to Taiwan. Yesterday they declined to comment. Their office said: &quot;There will be no statement, no interviews. Everything we want to say about this is contained in the report.&quot; Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Taxpayers&apos; Alliance, said: &quot;The Wintertons were wrong to continue this arrangement after they were told unequivocally that it was out of order. Those MPs who have been exposed for breaking the spirit of the expenses rules, if not always the letter, have clearly let taxpayers down, but the parliamentary authorities are also to blame ... the sooner parliament puts all receipts out in the open, the sooner this sorry saga can be brought to a close.&quot; Timeline Early 1990s Wintertons purchase Belgravia flat with \u00a3195,000 mortgage from Cheshire Building Society. Taxpayer meets most of \u00a32,381 monthly mortgage interest payments. 2001 Sir Nicholas inherits &quot;modest&quot; legacy and an insurance policy matures. Wintertons pay off mortgage. 2002 Wintertons set up a trust on the property to avoid \u00a3280,000 inheritance tax. They are the trustees, their children are the beneficiaries.

The last few years have seen both deteriorate markedly. The election of the nationalist Chen Shui-bian as president in 2000 and his re-election in 2004 was a nadir in the relationship between Taiwan and the mainland. The premiership of Junichiro Koizumi heralded a serious deterioration in Sino-Japanese relations, with Koizumi&apos;s insistence on an annual visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in his official capacity. Such was the growing antagonism between the two nations that in 2005 there was a wave of anti-Japanese demonstrations in major Chinese cities. This year, however, there has been an extraordinary turnaround in China&apos;s relations with both Taiwan and Japan which has exceeded all but the most optimistic expectations. Although relations between Japan and China have been steadily improving since Koizumi left office in 2006, there has, until now, been little progress on the substantive, rather than symbolic, matters that have divided the two countries. The Japanese prime minister Yasuo Fukuda has declined to visit Yasukuni, as did his predecessor Shinzo Abe, while high-level contacts between the two countries have been resumed with clear signs of growing warmth. Yesterday, however, came the big breakthrough. As Sino-Japanese relations worsened, the most obvious flashpoint was their conflicting offshore claims in the east China Sea where significant oil and gas reserves are believed to exist. Ignoring Japanese protests, the Chinese had already begun exploration, including in waters claimed by Japan. Now the two countries have announced that they will undertake  joint development of two gas fields in the disputed waters, while setting aside their territorial claims to be resolved at some point in the future. As a result, the most dangerous potential source of conflict between the two has been removed. The delicacy of relations between the two countries is obvious. They are the two great powers in east Asia. They are the world&apos;s second and third largest economies in the world. Ever since the Sino-Japanese war in 1894-5, relations between the two have always been acrimonious, climaxing in the Japanese occupation of China. For over a century, Japan has had an extremely dim view of its neighbour, but China&apos;s rise is rapidly transforming the balance of power between the two countries in China&apos;s favour. Japan has grown increasingly anxious in response. The key question is whether Japan will be able to reconcile itself to China&apos;s emergence as the increasingly dominant power in the region. The agreement is the first positive sign so far that the two countries may be able to find a modus vivendi. If 2008 has witnessed a serious improvement in relations with Japan, then those with Taiwan have been utterly transformed. The recent election of Ma Ying-jeou as president, and the sweeping victory of the KMT in the parliamentary elections in March, have created an entirely different atmosphere between the two countries. While Ma refuses to entertain the idea of reunification, he is determined to pursue much closer co-operation with China. Economic relations are likely to grow increasingly close while last week a new agreement was reached on extending tourism and enabling a major increase in direct flights. The Taiwanese public had grown weary of the nationalist Chen&apos;s desire to constantly provoke China, and increasingly concerned about the malaise that was engulfing the previously dynamic Taiwanese economy and its failure to foster closer relations with the soaring Chinese economy. It is now not inconceivable that the China-Taiwan relationship can, for the foreseeable future, enter a relatively benign phase. It is unlikely that the longer-run problem of Taiwan&apos;s sovereignty can be resolved, but short of that it seems entirely possible that the two will enjoy an increasingly close relationship. Tourism could grow apace, flights across the Taiwan Straits become commonplace, and increasing economic integration appears inevitable. With the constant threat of a declaration of independence posed by the nationalists sidelined, then the Beijing leadership can pursue an increasingly pragmatic attitude towards Taiwan. In that context, it might even begin to entertain more imaginative solutions to the sovereignty question, other than simply a modified version of the Hong Kong &quot;one country, two systems&quot; formula. That lies far off in the future, but it no longer seems quite such an exercise in fantasy as it did before. With relations between Japan and Taiwan improving rapidly, China&apos;s position in east Asia has been through a rapid metamorphosis compared with the situation that existed a decade ago when it was still largely isolated. It already enjoys an extremely good relationship with the Asean countries of south-east Asia, while South Korea has moved much closer to China. China is resuming its centuries-old position at the centre of east Asia."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/21/china.internet", "publicationDate": "2008-06-20T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Internet", "World news", "Technology", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["According to China Digital Times - a US-based website that monitors the internet in China - Hu scanned a page of questions that included topics such as Taiwan&apos;s democracy, inflation and officials wasting money on lavish banquets."], "title": "Boss Hu avoids tricky questions in online chat", "article": "In the 1930s, US president Franklin Roosevelt&apos;s fireside chats set the political tone of the radio age.

Without tapping a keyboard, the Communist leader dictated his responses to an online forum of the People&apos;s Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling party. Online video shows the president, who is widely seen as stiff and distant, visiting the newsroom to answer queries on the paper&apos;s website. According to China Digital Times - a US-based website that monitors the internet in China - Hu scanned a page of questions that included topics such as Taiwan&apos;s democracy, inflation and officials wasting money on lavish banquets. Some readers reportedly addressed the president as Boss Hu, Old Hu and Brother Hu, familiarity common on the internet but sharply at odds with protocol. But the forum host changed the title to General Secretary Hu as she read out an uncontentious question about how often the president uses the internet. &quot;Although I am very busy and I do not have the time to use the internet everyday, I try to spare some time to do it. I want to say that this online forum of People.com is one of the websites I visit often,&quot; Hu replied into a microphone. Asked next about his online reading habits, the president said he first followed domestic and foreign news, then looked for internet users&apos; comments about the work of the party and the country. Although ballot-box democracy is practised only at a local level in China, the leaders of the one-party state have shown themselves to be responsive at times to online opinion. China&apos;s net population is estimated at 221 million, after overtaking the US earlier this year. The last question asked whether Hu could see chatroom suggestions. &quot;We care a lot about internet users&apos; ideas and advice,&quot; said the president.

I was exhausted and yet still I couldn&apos;t sleep. It was early morning on day four of a 22-day journey and I wanted to be somewhere else: anywhere but on the Cologne to Moscow sleeper train. Travelling the 8,500 miles (13,679km) from Cardiff to Taiwan with no return ticket and without flying had seemed like a great idea a few weeks earlier. Although I hadn&apos;t done any serious travelling since the mid-1980s, I had read Paul Theroux&apos;s The Great Railway Bazaar, was a devoted follower of Michael Palin and had taken inspiration from the international train traveller&apos;s website, The Man in Seat Sixty-One.  But until I boarded the Moscow train, I hadn&apos;t even considered that travel and I might not be natural bedfellows. Punching my emaciated pillow and kicking the prickly, green-checked blanket to the foot of my bunk, I recalled my last meal, a mere four hours earlier, with hazy nostalgia. It was taken al fresco in the late evening shadow of Cologne cathedral with Gerhard, a silver-bearded, avuncular German writer, whom I&apos;d met over a chilled glass of weissbier on the Deutsche Bahn ICE train from Brussels. As we gulped the weak, pale yellow beer, locally-known as K\u00f6lsch, from dainty, cylindrical glasses, Gerhard ordered Bavarian liver loaf, fried potatoes and onions, and ham hock with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. As a dramatist he saw just wide-eyed adventure in my journey. But, as I heaved my backpack onto the Moscow-bound sleeper, my optimism stayed in Cologne. Compared to the three previous trains that had whisked me from Cardiff to Germany, the Russian train was a distant, aged and unfashionable relative. My pistachio green, airless compartment had three bunk beds and, apart from the light, none of the switches - heater, fan nor loudspeaker - did anything other than move.  The thermometer had three red bubbles, the tap in the corner sink dribbled tearfully, and, when I tried to recharge my phone, the socket just sizzled and promptly cut out. In the corridor, people with lost-looking faces, oversized bags and desperate voices were still trying to find their quarters. A tight-lipped woman and a dark-haired boy appeared at the door. He was aged about 11, wore a red Pirates of the Caribbean sweatshirt and a resolute scowl. His mother pushed him forward and told me without ceremony, &quot;You must sleep with my son.&quot;  I froze, but then realised she meant we had to share a compartment, not a bunk. I shook hands with Eddie and within minutes he was graphically reliving a fight he&apos;d had at school. He spoke some English, so I asked him what he wanted to be when he grows up. &quot;A boxer,&quot; he said as he pummelled the air. &quot;My dad was a boxer, too,&quot; he proudly added. And what does he do now? &quot;He&apos;s an economist.&quot; When I climbed into my bunk at midnight, dark thoughts joined me. How will I cope with three more weeks of austere sleeping compartments, unpredictable food supplies and random roommates? Why did I decide to travel alone? Why didn&apos;t I just fly to Taiwan or, better still, stay at home? On day four, as the train trundled and rocked lethargically through Poland, my fears and hunger grew. There was no restaurant car and I had neglected to pack emergency food rations.  Just before the Belarus border, a carriage attendant shoved two official forms into my hand. As I stared at the incomprehensible Cyrillic script, I knew that I was way out of my comfort zone.  But then Eddie&apos;s mother Natalia breezed into the compartment, patiently translated my immigration and customs forms and told me what to write. And when the train stopped at the border town of Brest, a gang of Belarussian women jumped on with baskets of food and drink.  They jostled for position in the corridor and thrust bread, meatballs, cheese, smoked fish and potato cake under my nose. The homemade aroma was irresistible and I dug in my wallet for roubles. Another face appeared at the back of the scrum. &quot;Try the potato cake,&quot; said Dimitris, a thirty-something lawyer from Volgograd. &quot;It&apos;s still warm and it will go great with my chicken.&quot; His pale blue eyes beamed as he held up a semi-transparent red and white plastic bag, heavy with his purchase. Soon, the two of us were sitting on my bunk, clunking beer bottles, picking at sticky chicken, ripping bread and sharing stories. Natalia and Dimitris&apos;s spontaneous gestures of friendship had given my journey a new, positive dimension. Fearful introspection had given way to excitement and I had begun to embrace the unexpected. But, as I took another sip of Belarussian beer, I knew that a much greater test still lay ahead: the 5,800-mile, seven-day journey from Moscow to Vladivostok.   \u00b7  Read Gary&apos;s Trans-Siberian tips and advice    \u00b7  Follow his schedule and costs as he goes    \u00b7  Read Gary&apos;s full account of his adventure on sixtrainstwoboats.blogspot.com "}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jun/25/japan.russia.ferry", "publicationDate": "2008-06-25T10:04:03Z", "tags": ["Japan holidays", "Russia holidays", "Taiwan holidays", "Green travel", "Boating holidays", "Travel", "Rail travel"], "sentences": ["From Tokyo, a Shinkansen (bullet train) whisked me to Osaka where, with some trepidation, I boarded the Hiryu ferry to Taiwan, via Okinawa."], "title": "Great journeys: Cardiff to Taiwan by train, part three", "article": "On a steel grey, damp afternoon at the beginning of the third and last week of my journey, I watched a string of black smoke rise from the funnel of the MV Rus, the ship that would take me through the impenetrable mist of the Sea of Japan. I was agonisingly close to leaving Russia but I had no idea where I should check in, or what time the ship would depart.  According to my ticket, departure time was 6pm. At 5pm, I eventually stumbled upon the shipping company&apos;s office, concealed behind an anonymous door on the top floor of a utilitarian, dockside building. My questions were met by sighing equivocation but at least I had discovered where I needed to wait: in the tomb-like basement with grey plastic chairs, bare magnolia walls and a tiny wall-mounted TV with a red-speckled screen. At 9pm and without prior warning, a pair of double doors opened.  A diminutive, green-uniformed official began letting people over the threshold. Another hour of the divine comedy passed and finally, I was into the next circle of hell: Russian customs. Ninety minutes later, and eight hours after arriving at the harbour, I finally climbed the slippery, wooden gangplank of the MV Rus. The 36-hour voyage passed pleasantly; the sea was placid and the weather benign. I had bumped into other, similarly confused western European travellers in the waiting room at Vladivostock and we dined and drank together on the MV Rus. The conversation, the Asahi beer and warm sake in the bar compensated for the bland food on board. Lunch on the first day, for example, was a tiny bowl of insipid seafood salad, followed by watery and tepid solyanka, and then cold potatoes with a rubbery schnitzel that merely bent the thin steel knife. Meal times were strictly enforced and courses were delivered to the table irrespective of whether the diner had finished the previous one. Surprisingly, I found Japan less of a culture shock than Russia. This was evident when the Japanese customs and immigration officials boarded the MV Rus. They set up desks and computers in the ballroom, told the passengers - in three languages - what was happening over the PA, handed out trilingual forms, and processed around 100 passengers courteously and efficiently within an hour.      Japanese snacks. Photographer: Gary Merrill     In Fushiki, guided by Umon, a Japanese student whom we had met on the MV Rus, our rag-tag band of travellers trudged through the sleepy streets and found three box-shaped taxis, driven by white-capped and gloved cabbies. They took us to Takaoka railway station and, after buying tickets, we went our separate ways. As the train glided through the flat coastal plain of western Japan, I chewed a snack of dried, vinegary octopus and watched the perfectly rectangular paddy fields pass by in precise rows. As we moved into central Japan the landscape became mountainous before finally, the train sped through the sprawling megalopolis of the east coast. From Tokyo, a Shinkansen (bullet train) whisked me to Osaka where, with some trepidation, I boarded the Hiryu ferry to Taiwan, via Okinawa. The Sea of Japan had been tranquil but this route, on the western edge of the Pacific Ocean, past the Ryukyu Islands and into the East China Sea, is notorious for high seas and typhoons. The Hiryu is a generation ahead of the MV Rus in every respect. The Japanese food was infinitely tastier; the bedding was softer; the beer colder; and the information was timely and accurate. There were very few passengers - the ship earns its keep from cargo - and the skeleton staff seemed to have several roles each. The deputy purser, for example, was also the cleaner, chef, waiter, barman and deck hand.     View from the Hiryu ferry of the Ryukyu Islands. Photographer: Gary Merrill     On the final evening of my 22-day journey, I sat cross-legged on the top deck with my map of the world and tried to guess the identity of the cloud-topped, jagged island closest to the ship. A band of shimmering gold stretched from the setting sun across the sea, which ruffled like deep blue silk. I decided that the island&apos;s name was unimportant; the serenity said it all. I pushed the map into my backpack and noticed a dog-eared piece of newspaper. It was an unread article by Paul Theroux that I&apos;d ripped out of The Observer before I left the UK. Back in my cabin, sipping my last cup of PG Tips, I was struck by Theroux&apos;s closing thoughts. He wrote: &quot;I think travellers are essentially optimists, or else they would never go anywhere.&quot; I then recalled my heightened anxiety on the Brussels to Moscow sleeper. As I had tossed and turned in my bunk, I imagined that every possible nightmare scenario - from capsizing boats to food poisoning - would afflict me at some point in my journey. In reality, the trip was plain sailing; not one of my fears came true. Indeed, whenever I hit a barrier, fate smiled with perfect timing. It delivered translators, calm seas, good health and, most importantly, companionship. Although I travelled solo, I was never alone. From Gerhard in Belgium, to Dimitris in Belarus; from Fizle, Slavic, Joe Cheng on the Trans-Siberian; to William, Dominic and Umon on the MV Rus, whether these people realised it or not, these coincidental encounters had helped convert me from a pessimist into an optimist.

As rich country leaders try to rally negotiators for this newest &quot;make-or-break&quot; deadline - in what has become the most imminent agreement in history - developing country negotiators should remember why the proposals on the table deserve to be sent back to the drawing board. The deal nearing completion has limited gains and real costs. With projected welfare gains of less than $16 billion (0.2% of developing country national income), tariff losses of at least $63bn, and projected declines in the relative value of exports, developing countries have little to gain from rushing to conclude Doha. Given the proliferation of lofty rhetoric about Doha and poverty reduction, the public can be excused for thinking this agreement is all about poverty and development. The World Bank modeled the gains from a &quot;likely&quot; Doha deal. Under this scenario (which is more ambitious than the proposals now on the table), global gains projected for 2015 are just $96bn, with only $16bn going to the developing world.  Of the benefits projected for developing countries, only a few see most of the gains. According to the World Bank, half of all the benefits to developing countries are expected to flow to just eight countries: Argentina, Brazil (which stands to receive 23% of the developing country benefit), China, India, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. The Middle East and Africa would be worse of from this deal. There are also real costs for the developing world. Total tariff losses for developing countries under the &quot;non-agricultural market access&quot; - or manufactured goods - aspect of the negotiations could be $63bn, or almost four times the level of benefits. For many developing countries, slashing tariffs will not only restrict the ability of these countries to foster new industries so that they may integrate into the world economy, but it will also limit government funds to support such infant industries and to maintain social programs for the poor. A majority of developing countries rely on tariffs for more than one-quarter of their tax revenue. For smaller nations with little diversification in their economies, tariff revenues provide the core of government budgets.  A likely deal will also contribute to declining terms of trade for developing countries, the ratio of export to import prices. This measure is considered a crucial estimate of the extent to which a developing country is moving up the value chain in the global economy, away from primary production and into manufacturing or knowledge-based economic activities. Declining terms of trade can accentuate balance of payments problems in countries and make the need to diversify into other export products ever more urgent.  Under a likely deal, world prices for agricultural products increase and manufacturing prices decrease slightly or remain unchanged. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace these price changes negatively affect the terms of trade for developing countries. The report explains that for many countries the rise in world prices for imported food and agricultural goods is countered with a decline in world prices for their light manufactured exports, such as apparel.  To diversify, developing countries often look at the example of the US and European economies, and more recently, the economies of South Korea and China. These countries diversified away from primary commodities and light manufacturing while slowly opening their economies. They moved into the world marketplace strategically, protecting their major exporting industries in order to nurture them to compete in world markets.  China&apos;s computer maker, Lenovo, is an example. The company was created by the government and protected for years; it purchased IBM&apos;s PC division and is now a world leader in high-technology electronics. Acer Computer from Taiwan and Hyundai and Kia Motors from South Korea followed similar long-range development paths.  Further cuts in manufacturing tariffs and services regulation in developing countries, which are under consideration in the current Doha proposals, will make it more difficult for developing countries to replicate these efforts. This loss of so-called &quot;policy space&quot; is why many developing countries see current rich-country proposals as tantamount to saying: &quot;do as we say, not as we do.&quot;  Developing countries should pull the plug on this moribund round until rich countries can agree to a new framework that lives up to Doha&apos;s promise to be a &quot;Development Round&quot; that favours poorer countries."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/28/gadgets.computing", "publicationDate": "2008-06-27T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Gadgets", "Computing", "Internet", "Technology", "Life and style", "Asus"], "sentences": ["Kick-ass teens from Taiwan to Tunbridge Wells are agog for it, having already been introduced to its predecessor, the Eee PC 701."], "title": "Dork Talk: Giles Foden on the Asus Eee PC 900", "article": "Do you remember the days of solid state? In the 70s, the words &quot;solid state&quot; could be found on most radios. Usually they bulked off the speaker grille in silvery haut-relief. As a boy I ran my finger across exactly such a sign. All summer I&apos;d waited at the end of a long avenue of Irish elms for the postman to bring the package from my father in Africa. But when it arrived and was duly opened, it was the mysterious term that transfixed me, not the music or words the radio carried. In that period, the term solid state advertised the transistor itself. It boasted the transition from valve to silicon technology. More recently, solid state has made a comeback. It&apos;s now used to describe the flash drives and other storage devices that (in some contexts) are replacing the whirring disks of electromechanical hard drives. Though less capacious, solid state drives (SSDs) are more rugged and faster than hard drives. No spin is required to start them, or to find things on them: in fact, the word &quot;drive&quot; is misleading. SSDs are now used in a range of tough, compact computers - so-called subnotebooks, often intended for the education or leisure of young people or for use in the developing world. One such is the Asus Eee PC 900 (from \u00a3199, depending on model; uk.asus.com for stockists) a ready-to-roll websurfer running Windows. Kick-ass teens from Taiwan to Tunbridge Wells are agog for it, having already been introduced to its predecessor, the Eee PC 701. That was partly a response to Nicholas Negroponte&apos;s one laptop per child initiative: the green XO machine with sticky-up aerials. Negroponte has just announced plans for an XO-2, due in 2010. The Eee PC is the size of a paperback. Available in colours from blush pink to lush green, it has a full keyboard, wireless connectivity and a built-in camera. A memory card slot acts as a second internal storage device: there is only 12GB on the SSD. Skype, Outlook Express and a few other things are pre-installed. The original Eee PC ran Linux, and one version of the 900 still does. Microsoft basically asked Asus to build the one under review. You can see why. Portable and cheap, it&apos;s a transitional device to a day when software will be web-derived rather than internally stored. For the time being, Windows is too clunkily full of cumbersome legacy code to run well on this little thing.  Those used to an Apple interface will find it especially frustrating. But not as frustrating as Apple&apos;s own failure to bring out a good subnotebook, oscillating between the iPhone and the MacBook. Not the wafer-like MacBook Air, but something that fits in a coat pocket, such as the Toshiba Libretto, HP Jornada or a souped-up Psion Series 7.  There&apos;s clearly a demand - I&apos;ve seen an emulator run Mac OS on the Libretto - and Apple has had a shot at this in the past: in 1997 its doomed Apple eMate 300 was designed as a low-cost laptop for the education market. Right now, there are rumours of a small Apple device larger than the iPhone (the new version of which is out next month) and of an Apple eBook viewer to compete with the Amazon Kindle and the Sony Reader. But we&apos;ll have to see. Whatever products come, they do not make everything right. One is reminded of the line from the Communist Manifesto used as the title of Marshall Berman&apos;s All That Is Solid Melts Into Air (1982). This brilliant book examines the relationship between technical, economic and social modernity, and artistic or lifestyle responses of modernism. Berman distinguishes between finding &quot;one&apos;s world and oneself in perpetual disintegration and renewal, trouble and anguish, ambiguity and contradiction&quot; and somehow making oneself at home in that turbulence, learning &quot;to make its rhythms one&apos;s own, to move within its currents in search of the forms of reality, of beauty, of freedom, of justice, that its fervid and perilous flow allows&quot;. No computer can teach you how to do that. But Apple always seems to come closest in helping. The Asus Eee PC 900 isn&apos;t even in the race. \u2022 Stephen Fry will return next month"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/jul/02/papersfacingaxeintaiwan", "publicationDate": "2008-07-02T07:54:02Z", "tags": ["Newspapers & magazines", "Media", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The days of some newspapers in Taiwan are numbered because there are too many titles chasing too few readers as people turn to the internet, according to a lengthy article in the China Post."], "title": "Papers facing axe in Taiwan", "article": "The days of some newspapers in Taiwan are numbered because there are too many titles chasing too few readers as people turn to the internet, according to a lengthy article in the China Post.

To echo this newspaper&apos;s memorable comment on the death of William Randolph Hearst, it is hard even now to think of him with charity. From his earliest years, Helms&apos;s attitudes recalled those of an earlier southern bigot, Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi, who so outraged his Senate colleagues, that they eventually refused even to let him take his seat. There was never a comparable risk for Helms, who maintained an old-world courtesy in his personal contacts. But that was only on the surface. He became one of the most powerful and baleful influences on American foreign policy, repeatedly preventing his country paying its UN contributions, voting against virtually all arms control measures, opposing international aid programmes as &quot;pouring money down foreign rat holes&quot;, and avidly supporting military juntas in Latin America and minority white regimes in Southern Africa. In domestic politics he denounced the 1964 Civil Rights Act as &quot;the single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced in the Congress&quot;, voted against a supreme court justice because she was &quot;likely to uphold the homosexual agenda&quot;, acted for years as spokesman for the large tobacco companies, was reprimanded by the justice department and the federal election commission for electoral malpractice, and compiled a dismal personal record as a slum landlord. The irony was that he was often seen as a relative moderate in his home state of North Carolina. His views sprang directly from his background as the son of the police chief in the small town of Monroe. Even before the Depression, life there was a constant struggle. It produced generations of deeply conservative poor whites, steeped in jingoistic patriotism and fundamentalist religion, who regarded the surrounding black population as barely part of the human race. Helms was educated at local schools and had just enrolled for a college course when America entered the second world war. In 1942, he joined the navy, to be given a role which inadvertently established his postwar career. As a recruiting officer, he had to make regular patriotic appeals on local radio. They brought him sufficient recognition after the war to abandon his college studies for journalism, initially as news editor of the Raleigh Times and later as director of news and programmes for the principal local radio network. In 1960, he was given an extraordinary boost when the owner of the main local television station appointed him one of the new medium&apos;s first editorial commentators. For 12 years, Helms appeared nightly at peak viewing time to denounce the civil rights struggle, trade unions, the UN, Lyndon Johnson&apos;s war on poverty, hippies, and any other social or political development rejected by the extreme right. His commentaries were repeated by 70 southern radio stations and, as they became increasingly popular, reprinted in 200 newspapers across America. In a climate well to the right of mainstream politics in Europe, Helms became extraordinarily influential among those Americans Richard Nixon dubbed the silent majority. At the same time he built up a solid political network in North Carolina, working for several conservative senators, serving on Raleigh town council, running the state&apos;s bankers&apos; association, and joining the Masons, their associates the Shriners, and the Rotarians.  By the time the Republican Richard Nixon moved into the White House in 1969, Helms&apos;s political ambitions had been focused. In 1972, in a state that had voted solidly Democratic since the civil war, he stood for the Senate as a Republican. In a bitter campaign against a middle-of-the-road opponent, Helms won by 8%. It was a signal of the South&apos;s seismic political shift after years of Democratic desegregation. It also made Helms the first North Carolina Republican to sit in the US senate for nearly 80 years. His initial ambition was to secure his place on the agriculture committee, where he could push the interests of the powerful tobacco lobby for which he had worked for years. But, in a move which proved a stroke of near-genius at a time when direct-mail was in its infancy, he and two close associates organised a postal campaign for a body they named &quot;the National Congressional Club&quot;. The repeated arrival of impressive-looking letters signed by Helms and denouncing school busing, funding for the arts, compensation for Japanese-Americans, the Red menace, and umpteen other liberal causes, sparked a stunning national response. His allegations were often mind-numbingly bizarre. &quot;Your tax dollars are being used,&quot; he claimed in one letter, &quot;to pay for grade school classes that teach our children that cannibalism, wife-swapping, and the murder of infants and the elderly are acceptable behaviour.&quot; But his rhetoric convinced millions of Americans and, invited to save the nation by donating a dollar, they did just that. A river of cash poured into the club. What happened to it all remained a constant mystery and, as the rules on election finances were slowly tightened, the club&apos;s accounts grew ever fuzzier. Some cash certainly went to the Coalition of Freedom, which had Helms as its honorary chairman until federal tax authorities began investigating its illegal campaign activities. More than $800,000 went to a firm called Jefferson Marketing. Then the election commission established that this company was inseparable from the club, making its electoral operations unlawful. Less traceable were donations to other conservative groups and to fundamentalist religious figures like Jerry Falwell. What is beyond question is the malign impact of Helms&apos;s innovation on all subsequent American politics. He inaugurated the age of massive back-door political donations, now euphemistically known as &quot;soft money&quot;. In his own 1984 re-election battle, he spent $16.5m, then the most expensive Senate campaign in American history (and the federal election commission twice penalised him for using illegal contributions). Sixteen years later, a New Jersey candidate would lavish $60m on gaining a Senate seat, making it evident how effectively Helms&apos;s initiative had opened political office to the highest bidder. It had also bankrolled the rise of the religious right and its effective takeover of the Republican party. That in turn polarised the entire American electorate, as the results in 2000 so dramatically demonstrated. With Helms&apos;s agenda moving into the political mainstream \u2014 opposition to abortion, gun control, foreign entanglements, multicultralism, social welfare, educational reform and a host of other liberal policies \u2014 millions of voters dropped out and the rest divided evenly into mutually hostile camps. For all his political posturing, however, Helms repeatedly showed himself inept at the tedious business of shepherding legislation through Congress. The Senate&apos;s tradition of choosing committee chairmen by seniority eventually brought him to head the agriculture committee (1981-87). It should have been an enviable chance to promote North Carolina&apos;s farming and tobacco interests, which employ half its people. Yet the state, ranked eleventh by population, had one of the nation&apos;s highest poverty rates and lowest levels of federal funding. Helms contributed his share to this misery with his ownership of rented houses in poor black districts of Raleigh. Some tenants reported that his properties had been without adequate heating for 30 years. The city&apos;s building inspectors repeatedly issued summonses against Helms to remedy a wide range of dilapidations, from rotting floors to leaking pipes. Helms&apos;s principal skill, in fact, was obstruction, which he employed ruthlessly once he assumed chairmanship of the foreign relations committee in 1995, having been a member since 1981. The Senate&apos;s arcane rule book offers virtually uncontrollable power to committee chairmen to determine their own agenda. In a private war with the state department, Helms refused to hold confirmation hearings for 18 new ambassadors, or to debate such key issues for the Clinton administration as the chemical weapons or strategic arms treaties. He cut the state department&apos;s funds by $1,700m until the administration finally agreed to his reorganization proposals, abolishing the arms control and information services and placing new restrictions on the US aid agency. In 1996, he caused an international furore by joining forces with Congressman Dan Burton of Indiana to push through the Helms-Burton Act, extending American jurisdiction to international companies trading with Cuba. But continued Republican control of the Senate meant that Helms could not be ignored. He established a Jesse Helms Centre in his home town of Wingate, at which American and foreign dignitaries could pay homage. Those unable to attend in person could demonstrate their goodwill in cash: Taiwan donated $225,000, Kuwait $100,000, and various tobacco companies more than $1m. Former president Jimmy Carter, secretary of state Madeleine Albright, Dr Henry Kissinger, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and other key public figures all turned up. Eventually even the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, heeded the call: in the aftermath of his visit, the foreign relations committee suddenly released America&apos;s long-outstanding payments to the UN. In later years, Helms suffered from increasingly poor health. He contracted prostate cancer and a bone disorder, Paget&apos;s disease, which obliged him to travel round the Senate building on a scooter. He also underwent a quadruple heart bypass. Helms finally lost his chairmanship of the foreign relations committee when the moderate Vermont Republican Senator James Jeffords, lost patience with the Bush administration in May 2001. His defection to the Democrats secured their control of the Senate and of all its legislative committees. This sudden loss of power, allied to his failing health, at last convinced Helms that it was time to give up. In August that year, he announced he would not run again when his term expired in 2002. Though there was dismay in North Carolina, his decision was greeted with relief by most of the country. The New York Times observed: &quot;Few senators in the modern era have done more to resist the tide of progress,&quot; and Robert Pastor, whose ambassadorship to Panama was scuppered by Helms in 1995, commented that, &quot;nothing Jesse Helms did in his entire career will enhance America&apos;s national security more than his retirement.&quot; He is survived by his wife Dorothy, two daughters and a son. \u0095 Jesse Helms, politician, born October 18 1921; died July 4 2008"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/05/china", "publicationDate": "2008-07-04T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["It was a momentous occasion for passengers taking the first regular flights across the 100-mile Taiwan Straits since the island separated from the Chinese mainland at the end of the civil war in 1949.", "While 4 million Taiwanese travelled to the mainland each year, there were only a handful of direct flights.", "Many mainland tourists speak literally when they describe the Taiwanese as family.", "&quot;I&apos;ve been dreaming about coming to Taiwan for a long time.", "He&apos;s really sick and I felt bad that I couldn&apos;t see him and take care of him.&quot; But while Chinese passengers spoke with patriotic fervour and painful longing, the Taiwanese were more pragmatic.", "Taiwan needs the mainland market,&quot; he said.", "Taiwan has democracy; in China the government has too much control of economics and politics.", "Taiwan&apos;s people can&apos;t trust them, so we can&apos;t combine into one country.&quot; Taiwan, once an economic powerhouse, hopes the mainland&apos;s explosive growth will infuse it with new life via tourism and increased financial links.", "Professor Christopher Hughes, an LSE-based expert on Taiwan, thought the boost from tourism had been overestimated.", "&quot;Their way of thinking was: &apos;Taiwan&apos;s come over to our way of thinking; Ma&apos;s going to do what we want him to,&apos;&quot; he said, adding that Beijing had updated its missiles opposite Taiwan.", "&quot;The question is: what is Taiwan getting out of this?&quot; Backstory China and Taiwan separated in 1949, when the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei at the end of the civil war.", "Relations have been tense ever since, particularly since both Japan and the United States see Taiwan&apos;s de facto independence as crucial to their geopolitical interests.", "Taiwanese investment poured into the mainland as the Chinese economy flourished in the 1990s, but the mood chilled under former president Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic People&apos;s party."], "title": "China resumes direct flights to Taiwan after 60 years", "article": "First came the cries of welcome from officials, the banks of flashing cameras, the thunder of drums, and the prancing lion dancers tossing their heads as tourists jostled their way through the arrivals hall.

It was a momentous occasion for passengers taking the first regular flights across the 100-mile Taiwan Straits since the island separated from the Chinese mainland at the end of the civil war in 1949. &quot;From today onward, regular commercial flights will replace the rumbling war planes,&quot; trumpeted an airline boss. While 4 million Taiwanese travelled to the mainland each year, there were only a handful of direct flights. Few Chinese were allowed to travel to Taipei at all until the thaw in relations prompted by president Ma Ying-jeou&apos;s election this spring. Now, as many as 1 million a year are expected to make the trip. Yesterday, many of the passengers on flight HU7987 posed for commemorative photographs as they set off from Beijing airport. Young and old on board the four-hour flight had similar feelings. &quot;We are family. We took different paths but we hope we can get together and develop. It&apos;s very important that we are one country,&quot; said Xu Yidong, an IT professional. Many mainland tourists speak literally when they describe the Taiwanese as family. Fan Qingju&apos;s household was severed by the civil war, when her two brothers fled to Taipei. The eldest died without seeing them again; the other, now 82, has not visited the mainland since he had a stroke. &quot;The last time my brother visited me in China was in 2002,&quot; said the retired high school teacher. &quot;I&apos;ve been dreaming about coming to Taiwan for a long time. He&apos;s really sick and I felt bad that I couldn&apos;t see him and take care of him.&quot; But while Chinese passengers spoke with patriotic fervour and painful longing, the Taiwanese were more pragmatic. Louis Chen sipped his tea calmly as the plane began to circle the island and other passengers craned towards the window for their first glimpse.  &quot;It&apos;s great for us - much easier and cheaper. It will save me about 500 yuan (\u00a337) a flight and four or five hours,&quot; said the actor and director. Until now, his regular trips between Beijing and Taipei meant going via Hong Kong or Macau. Like many who backed the winning KMT in this year&apos;s elections, he was impressed by their pledge to improve ties with Beijing. &quot;It&apos;s more realistic. Taiwan needs the mainland market,&quot; he said. But while Chen acknowledged China had come a long way since he first visited in 1990, he said: &quot;I believe in &apos;One China&apos; in culture and history, not in government. Taiwan has democracy; in China the government has too much control of economics and politics. Taiwan&apos;s people can&apos;t trust them, so we can&apos;t combine into one country.&quot; Taiwan, once an economic powerhouse, hopes the mainland&apos;s explosive growth will infuse it with new life via tourism and increased financial links. But it regards its neighbour with suspicion as well as envy. Beijing has threatened military action if Taipei declares independence. Stereotypes about less sophisticated cousins also endure, and were made embarrassingly evident last week when a senior health official apologised after promising to &quot;disinfect the places where Chinese tourists have passed through&quot;. While many shops offered special discounts to visitors, one restaurant window bore a &quot;no mainlanders&quot; sign. Professor Christopher Hughes, an LSE-based expert on Taiwan, thought the boost from tourism had been overestimated. His initial optimism about the thaw had also waned after conversations with mainland officials and academics. &quot;Their way of thinking was: &apos;Taiwan&apos;s come over to our way of thinking; Ma&apos;s going to do what we want him to,&apos;&quot; he said, adding that Beijing had updated its missiles opposite Taiwan. &quot;The question is: what is Taiwan getting out of this?&quot; Backstory China and Taiwan separated in 1949, when the defeated Nationalists fled to Taipei at the end of the civil war. Relations have been tense ever since, particularly since both Japan and the United States see Taiwan&apos;s de facto independence as crucial to their geopolitical interests. Taiwanese investment poured into the mainland as the Chinese economy flourished in the 1990s, but the mood chilled under former president Chen Shui-bian of the pro-independence Democratic People&apos;s party. The Nationalists won power this year on a promise to improve links. The first formal talks since 1999 were held last month."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/06/china.humanrights", "publicationDate": "2008-07-05T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "LGBT rights", "Environment", "Activism", "World news", "Culture", "Freedom of speech", "Science", "Life and style", "Health & wellbeing", "Media", "Protest", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The book was published in Taiwan; there is no chance that such a sensitive book could be published on the mainland."], "title": "China's new freedom fighters", "article": "Ma Jian, novelist, 53 I am a writer. Being critical is a writer&apos;s responsibility. In China, however, writers are encouraged to sing the praises of the government. Since being too critical may lead to the banning of their work, many exercise self-censorship or write books to please the market. I left Beijing in the late 1980s to live in Hong Kong because, having been blacklisted by the government, I couldn&apos;t publish my works on the mainland. My novella Stick out Your Tongue, which draws on my experience of travelling in Tibet, had been denounced as &apos;filthy and shameful&apos; and banned. In spring 1989 I returned to witness the student-led democratic movement. As the government brutally cracked down on the protest, my brother went into a coma after an accident. I just couldn&apos;t find the words to describe the sense of shock and despair I felt then; it forced me to see the evil face of the regime. My brother finally woke up after six months. I went back to Hong Kong until the handover in 1997. Then I moved to London. When I make trips back to China I am often struck how people seem to have forgotten about &apos;4 June&apos;. The whole of society, increasingly money-oriented, seems to have slipped into a coma. I spent 10 years writing Beijing Coma, exploring the double tragedies that took place in 1989. I want to wake people up from this vegetative state.  I divide my time between London and Beijing. I am trying to persuade my family to spend more time in China. It&apos;s no fun to be in exile. I can&apos;t even figure out the basic 26 letters, let along operate in English. I often feel that although I&apos;ve found the sky of freedom above my head, I&apos;ve lost the soil I stand on. I need to be back in my motherland, where I can find inspirations. I am concerned as to whether the government will let me back in after the publication of Beijing Coma in China later this year. But I have to speak the truth. My next book is a novel about the cost of the inhuman family-planning policy. But it is not just books. I openly criticise this dictatorial regime in my articles and interviews or whenever I can. If we don&apos;t, it will never change. And I want to remind people; when a country forgets its past, it will have no future. \u00b7 Beijing Coma is published by Chatto and Windus at \u00a317.99.

That was in 1990 when I was working for the Ministry of Public Health. I realised there was a huge amount of ignorance; one official openly said China had no Aids and called it a foreign disease caused by decadent lifestyles. That kind of attitude is all too common today. I set up an Aids hotline and launched Project Aizhixing to meet the challenge of Aids armed with love and knowledge. I was sacked for &apos;encouraging homosexuality, sympathising with prostitutes and advocating human rights&apos;.  I was and am sympathetic to prostitutes, with whom I had a lot of dealings for my research. They have the same rights as the rest of us. It was my deep belief in human rights as well as democracy that made me participate enthusiastically in 1989&apos;s democratic movement and that was why I chose to do what I am doing now. I didn&apos;t encourage homosexuality, though I am immensely interested in it, not only because I experienced some confusion myself, but also because I was appalled that it was regarded as some sort of mental illness.  I went to America to work on my MA in mental health and sexual orientation. I returned on graduation because I decided that the best way to fight for my cause was at grassroots level. Now my NGO, Aizhixing, funded by foreign organisations such as the Open Society Institute and the National Endowment for Democracy, is dealing with a wider range of issues. It promotes the rights of those living on the fringe, such as drug-users, prostitutes and haemophiliacs infected with HIV. Thanks to the sensitive nature of my work I have had many brushes with police. The first time I was arrested was on Aids Day in 1994 when I was distributing condoms and Aids leaflets. Two years later I was locked up yet again on the eve of a large conference where we planned to help those infected by HIV through blood transfusions to demand compensation from the government. In China, Aids and rights issues are deeply entwined. Because I am on the government blacklist, the Chinese media are not allowed to interview me. With the tightening up in the lead-up to the Olympics, our work is getting more difficult, but we are determined to soldier on.   Li Fangping, human rights lawyer, 34 Since I was young I have admired martial-arts masters from the past fighting to uphold justice, which was probably why I chose to become a lawyer. I have been practising since 1995, dealing mainly with civil, criminal and economic cases. And it wasn&apos;t until recently, when I met Chen Guangcheng, a blind advocate for peasant rights, that I became interested in human rights.  He called me in 2005 to inform me that he was under house arrest. Two friends and I went to Shangdong to see him. Before reaching his village we were attacked, then interrogated throughout the night before being kicked out of the province. I had never expected to experience such open violation of the law by the law. I became one of Chen&apos;s two defence lawyers. His crime? Inciting crowds to disturb social order. The truth was that he had exposed local officials&apos; abuse of human rights, including forced abortions. You can imagine the difficulties we encountered. At one point I was beaten up and had to be hospitalised because of a severe head injury. But I wasn&apos;t going to give up.  Chen was given four years&apos; imprisonment. I am not sure that our defence had any impact on the sentencing. I believe that the verdict was reached before the trial. Still, it was important that lawyers tried to defend him so that the rest of the world could know what was happening. Since then I&apos;ve taken many rights cases. Right now I am defending Hua Jia, an impassioned human rights campaigner in Beijing. He was sentenced to more than three years&apos; imprisonment for &apos;inciting to overthrow the government&apos;, the evidence being six articles he wrote on a website, Boxun, and two interviews he granted to foreign reporters. It is a classic case of &apos;being charged for one&apos;s words&apos;. We are planning to appeal. As in Chen&apos;s case, I don&apos;t think I have the power to set him free but if we lawyers accept that it can be a crime simply to say something, then the government will never change.  Dai Qing, environmentalist, 67 How did I become involved in the Three Gorges Dam project or, rather, in the campaign against the project? I was first drawn to it because of my deep belief in freedom of speech. I am a journalist, and if a journalist can&apos;t speak the truth, what kind of journalism is that? I came across the project in the mid-1980s when I was working for the Guangming Daily. We were told that no media in China could report on the Three Gorges Dam in a negative way because it was a political project that needed the whole nation&apos;s support. I learnt for the first time about the potential ecological and archaeological nightmares the dam could cause when a friend and politician invited me to an internal meeting.  I mobilised my journalist friends to interview experts who had doubts about the project. However, no newspapers or magazines dared to publish our findings. In the end, through some contacts, we published the interviews in a book called Yangtze! Yangtze!. Its impact was far greater than we expected, for when the National People&apos;s Congress, China&apos;s parliament, known as &apos;rubber stamp&apos;, voted on the project in 1992, one-third of the delegates decided against it.  If there was a free press or free public debate, this project would never have gone ahead. It went ahead because Chinese leaders wanted to make it a showcase for the idea that only socialist China could conquer nature and build the largest dam in the world. Now some of our fears have proved to be true - for example, sedimentation, the interruption of river traffic due to the low water level, land erosion and spiralling costs. Cracks on the dam have emerged, though you won&apos;t read that in the newspapers. With my friends I am compiling a collections of interviews with families who have had to move away. I&apos;d say that more than half of them are unhappy about moving, which shows the human cost of the project. Even when the families are compensated properly - and often they are not because of corruption - they lose so much by giving up their living environment and being separated from family and friends.  I speak out whenever I can, in the form of books, interviews and articles, published outside the mainland, of course. I have not been able to publish my works in China for 19 years. Now I have a new platform - my blog. I write about the Three Gorges, as well as the Olympics.  Both are political games about which the government doesn&apos;t allow dissident views. But if China really intends to become a powerful nation, it has to grant its people the freedom of speech.  Dean Peng, economist, 40 For a long time I had hope in the government - as long as it was willing to reform. One event in 2003 changed my mind. A girl known as Stainless Steel Rat was arrested for criticising the authorities. I thought, how can they arrest someone simply for what she has said? I organised a news conference for foreign journalists to expose this. Thanks to my action, and pressure exerted by fellow &apos;netizens&apos;, she was set free. It got me on to the police blacklist. In 2005, when I tried to attend the funeral of Zhao Ziyang, our reform-minded former Communist party Secretary, some policemen tried to stop me. I wouldn&apos;t oblige. We engaged in a fight; they sprayed mace on my face and I produced a knife. Some friends asked me: &apos;Why aren&apos;t you afraid?&apos; Why should I be? The government is weak, while I am strong because I have truth on my side.  I was born here and studied physics at Beijing University but later became an economist. I have translated into Mandarin lots of articles by Western economists and a satire about the need for a free market called The Adventures of Jonathan Gullible. I don&apos;t think China can have sustainable economic development in the long term with the current political system. I write articles to express my views, which are usually toned down before being published in the newspapers, but I post whatever I want to say on the net. And I criticise the authorities openly when I am being interviewed by the foreign media. I work occasionally as a fixer.  Last September I went with two Channel 4 journalists to film a detention centre where people who came to petition in Beijing were being kept illegally. We were roughly handled by some policemen and then detained for hours. I am now trying to sue the policemen. I oppose the government just as I would oppose any dictatorial regime. I just want to defend my human rights. If every Chinese person did the same, then the authorities wouldn&apos;t dare do whatever it wants, as it does at present. Woeser, Tibetan writer and blogger, 42 I am only one-quarter Han Chinese - the majority ethnicity in China - and three-quarters Tibetan, one of 55 registered minorities. And I&apos;ve always felt Tibetan. Even now I divide my time between Lhasa and Beijing. I grew up in a Tibetan area in Sichuan and attended Chinese schools with a standard &apos;red upbringing&apos;; we were taught to become &apos;the successors of communism&apos; and to &apos;continue the glorious struggle&apos;. My ethnicity didn&apos;t play a big role in my life until about 20 years ago after I read a book by John Avedon, In Exile From the Land of the Snows, about life before the communists and about the Dalai Lama&apos;s harrowing escape into India. I was fascinated because it was so different from what I learnt at school. I heard home calling. So I found a job in Lhasa as an editor of a literary magazine. I also found my spiritual belonging as I converted to Tibetan Buddhism. In 2003 I published a book called Notes on Tibet, a collection of essays, travel writing and reportage. The book also touched on sensitive topics. One story mentioned the monks&apos; love for the Dalai Lama, a simple fact denied by the authorities. After the book became popular, it was banned. My bosses ordered me to write a self-criticism and to promise not to write such stories. When I refused, they sacked me. When I inherited some wonderful black-and-white pictures taken by my father during the Cultural Revolution, I decided to write another book. If the Cultural Revolution remains a sensitive subject in the rest of China, in Tibet it is taboo. But I felt the story needed to be told. I interviewed 70 of the people in the pictures. Some described being persecuted and insulted; others confessed to taking part in the destruction of the city in the days of madness. The book was published in Taiwan; there is no chance that such a sensitive book could be published on the mainland. I was put on the authorities&apos; blacklist.  In March, while the drama in Tibet was going on, I was put under house arrest. I do worry about my personal safety. A fellow Tibetan writer was given 10 years&apos; imprisonment, and others have suffered worse fates. But I have this strong sense of mission that I must tell people what I see and feel."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2008/jul/07/chinesetouristsdispelsomes", "publicationDate": "2008-07-07T10:11:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "China", "Taiwan holidays", "Travel", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The advent of regular scheduled flights between China and Taiwan has many potential benefits, not least the chance to improve relations pitched at near-hysterical mutual antipathy for almost 60 years.", "Following a weekend of blanket media coverage of the event in Taiwan, the island&apos;s people are learning that not all their communist-ruled cousins are, in fact, ill-mannered, unsophisticated bumpkins.", "Taiwan&apos;s Chinese-language China Times, quoted by AP, sounded almost surprised:  Some of them [the mainland tourists] brought several credit cards for their shopping sprees.", "That mainland Chinese can be not only affluent but well mannered is little surprise to most nations, but the Taiwanese have long compensated for their numerical inferiority - 23m as against 1.3bn - with a well-developed sense of patronising condescension.", "Taiwan began its era of de facto (if rarely, these days, officially recognised) independence in 1949 when Nationalist forces fled to the island as Mao Zedong&apos;s Communists won China&apos;s civil war.", "While the mainland struggled with famine and doctrinally imposed official terror, Taiwan grew into a regional economic powerhouse.", "Relatively few Chinese nationals come to Taiwan, and even with the agreement of regular direct flights, Beijing is allowing a maximum of 3,000 arrivals daily.", "However, at least someone has had his expectations overturned - Lin Ming-the, a Taiwanese environmental activist, who admitted he had failed in his plan to catch Chinese tourists dropping litter at one tourist attraction."], "title": "Communist cousins take Taiwan by surprise", "article": "The advent of regular scheduled flights between China and Taiwan has many potential benefits, not least the chance to improve relations pitched at near-hysterical mutual antipathy for almost 60 years. But the first groups of mainland tourists touching down in Taipei also brought with them another opportunity - the chance to dispel some entrenched stereotypes. Following a weekend of blanket media coverage of the event in Taiwan, the island&apos;s people are learning that not all their communist-ruled cousins are, in fact, ill-mannered, unsophisticated bumpkins. Taiwan&apos;s Chinese-language China Times, quoted by AP, sounded almost surprised:  Some of them [the mainland tourists] brought several credit cards for their shopping sprees. Many of the female tourists carried the latest designer bags, and quite a few strolled around Taipei in high heels.  Television footage of the tourists busily shopping at upmarket outlets provided further evidence for the sceptical. That mainland Chinese can be not only affluent but well mannered is little surprise to most nations, but the Taiwanese have long compensated for their numerical inferiority - 23m as against 1.3bn - with a well-developed sense of patronising condescension. Taiwan began its era of de facto (if rarely, these days, officially recognised) independence in 1949 when Nationalist forces fled to the island as Mao Zedong&apos;s Communists won China&apos;s civil war. While the mainland struggled with famine and doctrinally imposed official terror, Taiwan grew into a regional economic powerhouse.  Even amid Beijing&apos;s current emergence as a major world power, islanders have had little chance to change sniffy attitudes. Relatively few Chinese nationals come to Taiwan, and even with the agreement of regular direct flights, Beijing is allowing a maximum of 3,000 arrivals daily. The manager of one Taipei travel agency was unenthusiastic about the possibility of more Chinese tourists, telling AFP:  Some waiters [complain] that Chinese customers throw bones or leftovers on the floor instead of leaving them on the plates or let cigarette ash fall everywhere.  However, at least someone has had his expectations overturned - Lin Ming-the, a Taiwanese environmental activist, who admitted he had failed in his plan to catch Chinese tourists dropping litter at one tourist attraction. He admitted his mistake:  I thought the Chinese were untidy.

They block roads, picket fuel depots, throw missiles and turn over cars in an effort to hold it at bay. The oil is running out and governments, they insist, must do something about it. When they&apos;ve sorted it out, what about the fact that the days are getting shorter? What do we pay our taxes for?  The latest people to join these surreal protests are the world&apos;s fishermen. They are on strike in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France and Japan, and demonstrating in scores of maritime countries. Last month in Brussels they threw rocks and flares at the police, who have been conspiring with the world&apos;s sedimentary basins to keep the price of oil high. The fishermen warn that if something isn&apos;t done to help them, thousands could be forced to scrap their boats and hang up their nets. It&apos;s an appalling prospect, which we should greet with heartfelt indifference.  Just as the oil price now seems to be all that stands between us and runaway climate change, it is also the only factor which offers a glimmer of hope to the world&apos;s marine ecosystems. No east Asian government was prepared to conserve the stocks of tuna; now one-third of the tuna boats in Japan, China, Taiwan and South Korea will stay in dock for the next few months because they can&apos;t afford to sail. The unsustainable quotas set on the US Pacific seaboard won&apos;t be met this year, because the price of oil is rising faster than the price of fish. The indefinite strike called by Spanish fishermen is the best news European fisheries have had for years. Beam trawlermen - who trash the seafloor and scoop up a massive bycatch of unwanted species - warn that their industry could collapse within a year. Hurray to that too.  It would, of course, be better for everyone if these unsustainable practices could be shut down gently without the need for a crisis or the loss of jobs, but this seems to be more than human nature can bear. The EU has a programme for taking fishing boats out of service - the tonnage of the European fleet has fallen by 5% since 1999 - but the decline in boats is too slow to overtake the decline in stocks. Every year the EU, like every other fishery authority, tries to accommodate its surplus boats by setting quotas higher than those proposed by its scientific advisers, and every year the population of several species is pressed a little closer to extinction.  The fishermen make two demands, which are taken up by politicians in coastal regions all over the world: they must be allowed to destroy their own livelihoods, and the rest of us should pay for it. Over seven years, European taxpayers will be giving this industry \u20ac3.8bn. Some of this money is used to take boats out of service and to find other jobs for fishermen; but the rest is used to equip boats with new engines and new gear, to keep them on the water, to modernise ports and landing sites; and to promote and market the catch. Except for the funds used to re-train fishermen or help them into early retirement, there is no justification for this spending. At least farmers can argue - often falsely - that they are the &quot;stewards of the countryside&quot;. But what possible argument is there for keeping more fishermen afloat than the fish population can bear?  The EU says its spending will reduce fishing pressure and help fishermen adopt greener methods. In reality, it is delaying the decline of the industry and allowing it to defy ecological limits for as long as possible. If the member states want to protect the ecosystem, it&apos;s a good deal cheaper to legislate than to pay. Our fishing policies, like those of almost all maritime nations, are a perfect parable of commercial stupidity and short-termism, helping an industry to destroy its long-term prospects for the sake of immediate profit.  But the fishermen only demand more. The headline on this week&apos;s Fishing News is &quot;Thanks for Nothing!&quot;, bemoaning the British government&apos;s refusal to follow France, Spain and Italy in handing out fuel subsidies. But why the heck should it? The Scottish fishing secretary, Richard Lochhead, demands that the government in Westminster &quot;open the purse strings&quot;. He also insists that new money is &quot;not tied to decommissioning&quot;: in other words no more boats should be taken off the water. Is this really a service to the industry, or only to its most short-sighted members?  I have a leaked copy of the draft proposal that European states will discuss on Thursday. It&apos;s a disaster. Some of the boats which, under existing agreements, will be scrapped and turned into artificial reefs, permanently reducing the size of the fleet, can now be replaced with smaller vessels. The EU will pay costs and salaries for crews stranded by the fuel crisis, so that they stay in business and can start fishing again when the price falls. Member states will be able to shell out more money (\u20ac100,000 instead of \u20ac30,000 per boat) without breaking state aid rules. They can hand out new grants for replacing old equipment with more fuel-efficient gear. The proposal seems to be aimed at ensuring that the industry collapses through lack of fish rather than lack of fuel. The fishermen won&apos;t go down without taking the ecosystem with them.  What makes the draft document so dumb is that in some regions, especially in British waters, the industry is just beginning to turn. While Spanish, French and Italian fishermen clamour for a resumption of bluefin tuna fishing - knowing that if they are allowed to fish now this will be the last season ever - around the UK it has begun to dawn on some fishermen that there might be an association between the survival of the fish and the survival of the fishing. Prompted by Young&apos;s seafood and some of the supermarkets, who in turn have been harried by environmental groups, some of the biggest British fisheries have applied for eco-labels from the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for how fish are caught. Fishermen around the UK also seem to be taking the law more seriously, and at last to be showing some interest in obscure issues such as spawning grounds and juvenile fish (which, believe it or not, turn out to have a connection to future fish stocks). By ensuring that far too many boats, and far too many desperate fishermen, stay on the water, and that the remaining quotas are stretched too thinly, the EU will slow down or even reverse the greening of the industry.  Why is this issue so hard to resolve? Why does every representative of a fishing region believe he must defend his constituents&apos; right to ensure that their children have nothing to inherit? Why do the leaders of the fishermen&apos;s associations feel the need always to denounce the scientists who say that fish stocks decline if they are hit too hard? If this is a microcosm of how human beings engage with the environment, the prospect for humanity is not a happy one. monbiot.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/jul/11/filmandmusic1.filmandmusic1", "publicationDate": "2008-07-10T23:14:40Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Food films spanned cultures and made everyone feel good about themselves: they came from Japan (Tampopo), Mexico (Like Water for Chocolate), the US (Big Night), Taiwan (Eat Drink Man Woman) and Denmark (Babette&apos;s Feast)."], "title": "Andrew Pulver and John Harris on coffee table culture", "article": "The following correction was printed in the Guardian&apos;s Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday July 17 2008  In the article below we said that Francis Ford Coppola thought nothing of chopping up a bullock on camera when he was filming the climax of Apocalypse Now. Francis Ford Coppola advises us that the animal was not killed for the film. His film crew documented the ceremonial sacrifice of a water buffalo by Ifagao people, but did not interfere in the ritual.    Movies became a metaphor for family, society, good living, good taste ... Andrew Pulver on film Exactly when did cinema get sanitised? It&apos;s hard to tell. In the old days (by this we mean the 1960s and 70s), no film with aspirations to intellectual or artistic credibility would pass up the chance to humiliate, torment or generally eviscerate its protagonists. The cinema of Werner Herzog was one long theatre of cruelty. Everyone from Ingmar Bergman to Martin Scorsese seemed to be saying: bring the pain. Fellini and Antonioni delighted in showing the European bourgeoisie to be pathetically shallow and materialistic. Bernardo Bertolucci had a woman gruesomely shot dead in The Conformist; he followed it up with Marlon Brando calling his dead wife &quot;a goddamn pig-fucking liar&quot; in Last Tango in Paris. Francis Ford Coppola thought nothing of chopping up a bullock on camera at the climax of Apocalypse Now. Would this ever happen today? Would the world&apos;s best-known, leading-edge film-makers take the chance of alienating audiences by involving themselves with such ugly, grubby, dislikable characters? It&apos;s frankly inconceivable. Of course there are don&apos;t-give-a-shit mavericks such as Gaspar No\u00e9 and Michael Haneke, but they are few and far between. Button-pushing art films - the likes of Atonement, The English Patient or The Hours - are far more the contemporary model: filled with literate, graceful dialogue, high-tone musical scores and perfectly sculpted cheekbones, they are warmly rewarding experiences (no doubt) for those creating them, and scoop up audiences with ease. Being dangerous and unpleasant is left to neophytes, outsiders, or the slugs who populate the slasher and torture-porn sub-worlds. Can we put a date on this coffee-table-isation of film? Like much else, the cultural seachange of the early 80s, as commercial Hollywood cinema roared out of its 70s doldrums, is most likely responsible. Difficult films got pushed out of the mainstream; those in search of them were forced to go to fancy little cinemas that were quickly termed &quot;arthouses&quot;. Instead of just being part of the general run of stuff to see, getting in front of this sort of cinema became, for a certain kind of cinemagoer, a specific purchase of intellectual sustenance, and that&apos;s where the change happened. Worst of all, it became fashionable to go to see something like Betty Blue or My Life as a Dog - the latter being the prototype for a seemingly endless parade of sappy European movies with a cute little tyke in the lead. These two films both reached our shores in 1986, so it&apos;s fair enough to nail that year as the key moment. Trouble comes in threes; 1986 also saw the release of Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, films with unforeseen consequences on a continental scale. An entire generation of Brits, spurred on by their whimsical vision of rural Provence, would head over there for the next three decades. (For G\u00e9rard Depardieu, it was a long way from the crotch-grabbing nastiness of Les Valseuses, the film that made him an industry name in the early 70s.) Perhaps it suited the 1980s: audiences were no longer in the mood for unsettling interrogations of the human condition, but wanted to feel the reassurance that resurgent Anglo-American capitalism was promising them. Wim Wenders&apos; Wings of Desire - arguably the most coffee-table of 80s coffee-table movies - was, in retrospect, the first gentle tap of a chisel at the concrete in the Berlin Wall. Wings of Desire defined late 80s Euro-bohemianism - which therefore made it essential viewing - but didn&apos;t discombobulate its audience as Wenders&apos; German compatriots had done a decade before. Instead, it was a serene fable about angelic love that was so sappy it got remade by Hollywood as City of Angels in 1998. (I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever get a Nicolas Cage version of Aguirre, Wrath of God.) The cleverest film-makers, of course, managed to merge their work with the exact same lifestyle concerns of actual coffee-table books. Food films spanned cultures and made everyone feel good about themselves: they came from Japan (Tampopo), Mexico (Like Water for Chocolate), the US (Big Night), Taiwan (Eat Drink Man Woman) and Denmark (Babette&apos;s Feast). As the 90s rolled on, food preparation won a dominant position as the user-friendly metaphor for family, society, good taste, good living, personal realisation - everything, in fact, coffee-table culture aspires to be. No wonder food shows planted themselves so immovably in the light-entertainment world of TV. It all goes some way to explain the success, in recent years, of the feature-length documentary. The unpredictability, toughness and unvarnished nature of the best docos is a throwback to the fearlessness of the 70s. (Of course, documentary has its own coffee-table variants, such as the cute moppets of Spellbound, or the spangly dance moves of Mad Hot Ballroom.) But you can&apos;t be tough all the time. Sneer all you like, the best coffee-table cinema is popular, likable and does its job with ruthless brilliance. Take Cinema Paradiso, on many levels the definitive coffee-table film, and which regularly tops the poll for audiences&apos; favourite films. It did something right, that&apos;s for sure. And it&apos;s still doing it. Like a good coffee-table book, you may not look at it very often, but it&apos;s good it&apos;s still hanging around.

At 38, I am far too old for any of that, and more than happy to admit that the universe these days defined by Zane Lowe, the Cribs and Lightspeed Champion is no longer for me. Moreover, when I was preparing to write this, I had a look at my CD shelves and discovered that no end of coffee table music was present and correct. For example, I own - and, very occasionally, play - Feist&apos;s The Reminder, the latest Hot Chip record, and In Our Nature by the mumblesome Swedish-Argentinian balladeer Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez. By way of proving that there are parts of the coffee-table universe that have always been off-limits, I have never bought anything by Everything But the Girl, nor had much truck with that now-faded coffee table king Moby, but still: age makes one vulnerable to easy-on-the-ear stuff that retains a faintly &quot;edgy&quot; aspect, and why apologise? Nonetheless, one surely cannot hear the phrase &quot;coffee-table music&quot;, without a shudder of unease. Though it&apos;s important to realise that the tag often says more about the person who owns a record that the musicians who made it, you know the phenomenon when you come across it: stuff that comes with a patina of bohemian cool and intellectual depth, divorced from the urgency and intensity of youth, coveted by a certain kind of punter for reasons way beyond its musical merits, and often used to soundtrack those occasions when - oh yes - &quot;people come round&quot;, perhaps in the hope that come one of the inevitable pregnant pauses, someone will say: &quot;This is nice - what is it?&quot; You can imagine one of several replies du jour: &quot;This is Joan As Police Woman, man. She once went out with Jeff Buckley, I first heard her on 6 Music, and she&apos;s just done a live thing on The Culture Show.&quot; To that, there will come one of two replies: either that the music sounds alright, but uncomfortably like something you might hear being innocuously tinkled out in the bar of an American boutique hotel, or that it&apos;s really very good, and so much better than the Kooks, and is it available on iTunes? Either way, the point will have been made: that the host is plugged into that global mess of stuff - Urban Outfitters, DVDs featuring the Artificial Eye logo, once-yearly surfing trips - that ensures that despite a mortgage, kids and grey hairs, they will never end up like their parents, oh no. Where did all this start? Though one might trace the roots of CTM to the late 60s musical mutation that spawned singer-songwriters (so, while we&apos;re here, a quick hat-tip to that coffee-table goddess Joni Mitchell), a good deal of the story began in the mid 1990s, when weekend clubbers heading towards their late 20s gave rise to a market for music to soundtrack their quieter moments. So-called &quot;trip-hop&quot; was a prime example, so though the brilliance of a lot of the people involved meant the coffee-table tag seemed rather vulgar, it quickly stuck to such records as Portishead&apos;s Dummy, Massive Attack&apos;s Blue Lines and Protection, and Tricky&apos;s Maxinquaye. From there, via Bj\u00f6rk and the work of the supposed &quot;comedown queen&quot; Beth Orton, it was a short hop to the dread moment in 1996 when I walked into the offices of the music magazine where I worked - Q, for what&apos;s worth - to be greeted by the spectacle of the staff going about their business while an emollient strain of electronica parped away in the background. &quot;What&apos;s this?&quot; I asked my boss. &quot;This is Alex Reece, man,&quot; he said, holding up a CD by a long-lost bloke who achieved minor fame thanks to his invention of a genre known as &quot;jazzstep&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s sort of coffee-table drum&apos;n&apos;bass.&quot; And now look where we are. What is the Mercury prize, but an award given to any given year&apos;s coffee-table most-likely-to? Given that past winners have included the aforementioned Dummy, Roni Size and Reprazent&apos;s New Forms, Gomez&apos;s Bring It On, Talvin Singh&apos;s OK, Badly Drawn Boy&apos;s The Hour of Bewilderbeast and Antony and the Johnsons&apos; I Am a Bird Now, the argument seems unanswerable. Elsewhere, survey today&apos;s mind-boggling array of summer events, and the tyranny of CTM seems yet stronger. Most notably, there is the Latitude festival - &quot;fun and frolics in beautiful surroundings on the Suffolk coast&quot;, it says here - whose big draws this year include Sigur R\u00f3s, Elbow, Martha Wainwright and the Guillemots; talented people who would doubtless shiver at the mention of CTM, but whose success is partly based on it. But here&apos;s the really important thing. Even if the merchants of the best CTM - Damn Fine Coffee Table Music, if you will - easily transcend the term, every now and again, something comes along that points up what an evil genre-cum-lifestyle accessory it can be. In 2008, one man is all this incarnate: Mark Ronson. Top work on Back to Black, undoubtedly, but what is his covers collection Version but an expertly assembled collision of cultural signifiers seemingly squashed together to ensnare the whole of the CTM market? Again, you can picture the scene: a social gathering (including, say, David Tennant, Thandie Newton, George Osborne and Fi Glover) and the inevitable coffee-table chorus: &quot;Ooh - Amy Winehouse! Aaah - look what he&apos;s done to the Smiths! Mmmf - I only just realised that&apos;s a Coldplay song!&quot; Here, the coffee table is less a matter of handy cultural shorthand than something to metaphorically pick up and beat the artist with. Still, even if your CTM sensitivities are in good enough order to realise all this, the term has now become so elastic as to make it pretty much unavoidable, as I discovered the other week. This may be a painfully thirtysomething anecdote, so forgive me: the woman who cuts my hair - a terrifyingly on-the-case music-lover, who was the first person I met who liked Cat Power - recently suggested I nip into the nearest indie record shop and buy For Emma, Forever Ago, by the midwestern singer-songwriter Justin Vernon, who trades as Bon Iver. I did as I was told, and have been regularly luxuriating in its wintry magic ever since. Given that the record was made in a log cabin in Wisconsin, coffee tables were presumably light years from its author&apos;s mind, but a quick browse online brought dread news indeed: according to posts on at least two indie-rock discussion threads, Bon Iver represent &quot;coffee-table indie&quot;, and albeit reluctantly, I can see their point. So there you are: once again, the CTM cap fits, and I&apos;ll have to wear it."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/11/features.culture", "publicationDate": "2008-07-11T08:11:59Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Food films spanned cultures and made everyone feel good about themselves: they came from Japan (Tampopo), Mexico (Like Water for Chocolate), the US (Big Night), Taiwan (Eat Drink Man Woman) and Denmark (Babette&apos;s Feast)."], "title": "No more Mr Nasty Guy", "article": "Exactly when did cinema get sanitised? It&apos;s hard to tell. In the old days (by this we mean the 1960s and 70s), no film with aspirations to intellectual or artistic credibility would pass up the chance to humiliate, torment or generally eviscerate its protagonists. The cinema of Werner Herzog was one long theatre of cruelty. Everyone from Ingmar Bergman to Martin Scorsese seemed to be saying: bring the pain. Fellini and Antonioni delighted in showing the European bourgeoisie to be pathetically shallow and materialistic. Bernardo Bertolucci had a woman gruesomely shot dead in The Conformist; he followed it up with Marlon Brando calling his dead wife &quot;a goddamn pig-fucking liar&quot; in Last Tango in Paris. Francis Ford Coppola thought nothing of chopping up a bullock on camera at the climax of Apocalypse Now. Would this ever happen today? Would the world&apos;s best-known, leading-edge film-makers take the chance of alienating audiences by involving themselves with such ugly, grubby, dislikable characters? It&apos;s frankly inconceivable. Of course there are don&apos;t-give-a-shit mavericks such as Gaspar No\u00e9 and Michael Haneke, but they are few and far between. Button-pushing art films - the likes of Atonement, The English Patient or The Hours - are far more the contemporary model: filled with literate, graceful dialogue, high-tone musical scores and perfectly sculpted cheekbones, they are warmly rewarding experiences (no doubt) for those creating them, and scoop up audiences with ease. Being dangerous and unpleasant is left to neophytes, outsiders, or the slugs who populate the slasher and torture-porn sub-worlds. Can we put a date on this coffee-table-isation of film? Like much else, the cultural seachange of the early 80s, as commercial Hollywood cinema roared out of its 70s doldrums, is most likely responsible. Difficult films got pushed out of the mainstream; those in search of them were forced to go to fancy little cinemas that were quickly termed &quot;arthouses&quot;. Instead of just being part of the general run of stuff to see, getting in front of this sort of cinema became, for a certain kind of cinemagoer, a specific purchase of intellectual sustenance, and that&apos;s where the change happened. Worst of all, it became fashionable to go to see something like Betty Blue or My Life as a Dog - the latter being the prototype for a seemingly endless parade of sappy European movies with a cute little tyke in the lead. These two films both reached our shores in 1986, so it&apos;s fair enough to nail that year as the key moment. Trouble comes in threes; 1986 also saw the release of Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources, films with unforeseen consequences on a continental scale. An entire generation of Brits, spurred on by their whimsical vision of rural Provence, would head over there for the next three decades. (For G\u00e9rard Depardieu, it was a long way from the crotch-grabbing nastiness of Les Valseuses, the film that made him an industry name in the early 70s.) Perhaps it suited the 1980s: audiences were no longer in the mood for unsettling interrogations of the human condition, but wanted to feel the reassurance that resurgent Anglo-American capitalism was promising them. Wim Wenders&apos; Wings of Desire - arguably the most coffee-table of 80s coffee-table movies - was, in retrospect, the first gentle tap of a chisel at the concrete in the Berlin Wall. Wings of Desire defined late 80s Euro-bohemianism - which therefore made it essential viewing - but didn&apos;t discombobulate its audience as Wenders&apos; German compatriots had done a decade before. Instead, it was a serene fable about angelic love that was so sappy it got remade by Hollywood as City of Angels in 1998. (I don&apos;t think we&apos;ll ever get a Nicolas Cage version of Aguirre, Wrath of God.) The cleverest film-makers, of course, managed to merge their work with the exact same lifestyle concerns of actual coffee-table books. Food films spanned cultures and made everyone feel good about themselves: they came from Japan (Tampopo), Mexico (Like Water for Chocolate), the US (Big Night), Taiwan (Eat Drink Man Woman) and Denmark (Babette&apos;s Feast). As the 90s rolled on, food preparation won a dominant position as the user-friendly metaphor for family, society, good taste, good living, personal realisation - everything, in fact, coffee-table culture aspires to be. No wonder food shows planted themselves so immovably in the light-entertainment world of TV. It all goes some way to explain the success, in recent years, of the feature-length documentary. The unpredictability, toughness and unvarnished nature of the best docos is a throwback to the fearlessness of the 70s. (Of course, documentary has its own coffee-table variants, such as the cute moppets of Spellbound, or the spangly dance moves of Mad Hot Ballroom.) But you can&apos;t be tough all the time. Sneer all you like, the best coffee-table cinema is popular, likable and does its job with ruthless brilliance. Take Cinema Paradiso, on many levels the definitive coffee-table film, and which regularly tops the poll for audiences&apos; favourite films. It did something right, that&apos;s for sure. And it&apos;s still doing it. Like a good coffee-table book, you may not look at it very often, but it&apos;s good it&apos;s still hanging around."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/11/conservatives.planning", "publicationDate": "2008-07-11T15:48:24Z", "tags": ["Conservatives", "Politics", "UK news", "Planning policy"], "sentences": ["Among the MPs reporting subsidised trips were former chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell and Ukip&apos;s Bob Spink, who each had a visit worth \u00a33,000 paid for by the Government of Taiwan."], "title": "Tory frontbenchers declare thousands of pounds in donations", "article": "Conservative frontbenchers have received tens of thousands of pounds in donations in recent months, new figures show. The data, released today by the Electoral Commission, follows a ruling in May by Westminster&apos;s standards commissioner that shadow cabinet members should individually declare donations to their offices, even if they have been channelled through Conservative central office.  In his ruling on a complaint from two Labour MPs, Commissioner John Lyon made no criticism of the shadow cabinet, but gave them four weeks to update their entries in the Commons register of members&apos; interests.  Today&apos;s monthly release from the Electoral Commission includes cash donations accepted during April and May, as well as a number of subsidised trips. Most of the gifts have already been entered separately in the register.  Andrew Mitchell, shadow international development secretary, received the most with cash donations totalling \u00a372,500, the bulk of which was registered before Lyon&apos;s ruling.  His gifts included \u00a350,000 from Helena Frost of Hove and \u00a315,000 from pharmaceuticals millionaire Lennart Perlhagen.  Shadow foreign secretary William Hague recorded cash donations totalling \u00a310,000 as well as a non-cash donation worth \u00a37,263 from finance company CQS LLP and flights worth \u00a33,314 paid for by Flying Lion Ltd.  Shadow justice secretary Nick Herbert received \u00a315,000 from public relations and research group Chime Communications.  Conservative health spokesman Stephen O&apos;Brien recorded a cash donation of \u00a325,000 from Julian Schild, the former owner of Huntleigh Technology, which makes life support and sterilisation systems for the NHS.  Transport spokesman Mike Penning reported a \u00a335,000 gift from tourism and training tycoon Jan Telensky and shadow Cabinet Office minister Greg Clark a \u00a35,000 gift from Stephen Barry.  Among the MPs reporting subsidised trips were former chancellor Kenneth Clarke, Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell and Ukip&apos;s Bob Spink, who each had a visit worth \u00a33,000 paid for by the Government of Taiwan.  Former International Development Secretary Clare Short reports visits funded to the tune of \u00a36,882 by the United Nations, the African Development Bank and Stern magazine, while the victor of yesterday&apos;s Haltemprice and Howden by-election David Davis had a visit worth \u00a33,500 paid for by the Sutton Trust educational charity. The monthly update of donations and subsidised trips to MPs also lists a flurry of late submissions, some dating back as far as 2004.  A government white paper on party funding, published last month, has responded to electoral watchdog calls for powers to impose penalties on MPs who fail to register donations within thirty days, as required.  Currently, the commission only has powers to slap penalties on political parties for late submissions, but not individuals.  A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said there was a need for &quot;a more flexible range of sanctions to enable a rigorous, yet proportionate, response to breaches of the rules on party and election finance.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/15/reutersgroup.mediabusiness", "publicationDate": "2008-07-15T09:13:32Z", "tags": ["Media business", "Newspapers & magazines", "Thomson Reuters", "Business"], "sentences": ["Rhoads, who is a Stanford graduate and speaks fluent Mandarin, is currently north Asia editor for Reuters, covering China, Taiwan, Korea and Hong Kong from his base in Beijing."], "title": "Brian Rhoads promoted at Thomson Reuters", "article": "Brian Rhoads has been named the new managing editor of Thomson Reuters across north, south and central America.

China will not just be screening artists&apos; work visas - they will even be screening setlists. &quot;Any artistic group or individual who has ever engaged in activities that threaten our national sovereignty will not be allowed in,&quot; the Ministry of Culture announced in a statement.

Bj\u00f6rk seemed to have protesting in mind when she performed her song Declare Independence in March, throwing Tibet&apos;s name into the mix. China has occupied Tibet since the 1950s, calling it their own rightful territory. The Tibetan independence movement - long active on the world stage - has received renewed attention in advance of the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

Even encores will be subject to government scrutiny. &quot;Nothing that has not been approved will be allowed to be performed,&quot; they have stated.

Warm slowly until the sugar is completely melted, stirring regularly. Then boil for 10 minutes, again stir regularly, taking care the mixture does not boil over. Add condensed milk and vanilla essence, bring to boil and boil for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to thicken and develops a caramel colour. Remove from the heat and beat until thicker. Then test a drop on a saucer, and beat. If it thickens quickly, the mixture is ready; otherwise return to heat. Pour into buttered trays - cool slightly, then cut into squares before it&apos;s cold. Store in an airtight jar. Tablet is a traditional Scottish sweet - like a harder version of fudge. Mum made it throughout our childhood - for jumble sales, as a treat, and as a cold remedy with a dash of whisky. It was famous among our cousins and friends and we were mobbed when we took it to school. Even as adults, if we had a bad cold a box of tablet would be posted immediately from Scotland.

Photograph: Hussein Malla/Associated Press In Bolton or Toronto, it would be in questionable taste. That  Buns &apos;n&apos; Guns, a war and terrorism-themed cafe, has opened in - wait for it - Beirut, surely makes it a contender for the worst restaurant concept ever? B &apos;n&apos; G regulars can eat a Magnum with a side order of Grenade (grilled chicken with fries); a Kalashnikov (beef burger on &quot;terrorist&quot; bread); an RPG; M16; or Tactical meal deal, all cooked by chefs dressed in military fatigues, in a cafe - slogan: &quot;A Sandwich Can Kill You&quot; - decorated with mortars, ammunition and sandbags. And the background music? No, not A.R.E Weapons or WAR, but explosions and gun fire. Noises which you might have thought residents of this Hezbollah-controlled suburb had had enough of in recent years. It&apos;s not all been plain sailing - what with people mistaking his fast food joint for a weaponry shop; and Western journalists tripping over one another to get their hands on a Terrorist meal - but co-owner Ali Hammoud claims his motives are innocent. &quot;It&apos;s just an idea I had, nothing more, nothing less,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;I could have put toys in place of the sandbags, and teddy bears instead of guns. But it was just an idea.&quot; Have a look at the  Associated Press TV report on Buns &apos;n&apos; Guns, and you&apos;ll get a flavour for how Ali&apos;s decision to go down the brutal violence, rather than the Rupert the Bear, route, has been received. YouTube users have been involved in a vicious debate (complete with a rich variety of curiously sexualised threats), that takes in the Iraq war, the history of suicide bombings and alleged Roman pogroms in Alexandria circa AD38. As one poster pleads: &quot;Will you people keep it down, I&apos;m trying to eat a Kalashnikov.&quot; Despite this controversy, however, Buns &apos;n&apos; Guns is still far from the most ill-conceived and/ or deeply offensive restaurant of recent memory. The dubious honour must surely go to  Hitler&apos;s Cross, the Mumbai restaurant which, in 2006, was forced into a rapid refurbishment and name-change when the owners conceded that, on second thoughts, Hitler posters and Nazi memorabilia might not be the way to go. &quot;How can anybody think of naming a restaurant after a perpetrator of such heinous crimes against humanity?&quot; asked the chair of the Indian Jewish Federation. Here at WoM we share his disgust, but also a dumbfounded confusion as to  why people are so fascinated by theme restaurants  in the first place. That Moscow&apos;s nouveau riche want to flaunt their wealth by eating  at the city&apos;s numerous concept restaurants is, perhaps, understandable, if depressing. What is the point of having money if you can&apos;t eat like a penniless Ukrainian peasant at Shinok? And then, on the following night, feast (on pan-Asian food designed by Alan Yau) at Turandot, a supra-rococo homage to Puccini&apos;s opera and 17th century aristocratic luxury. Taiwan&apos;s fondness for wacky, however, is harder to explain. In a country with a, supposedly, sophisticated food culture, why do people still crave the novelty and distraction  of hospital and jail-themed restaurants, much less one where you eat your meal from a toilet bowl? A new, unused one, let&apos;s hope. Similarly, given that life can be hard, and life-expectancy low, on the Polish-Ukrainian border, it&apos;s curious that an undertakers in Truskavets think  Eternity , their coffin-shaped, funeral-themed restaurant, will fly. Not that this predilection for kitsch and colourful themes is the sole preserve of ker-a-zy foreigners. Generally speaking, I steer clear of medieval banquets and Hard Rock cafes, but I have drunk hot (not warm, actually hot) beer and eaten eminently forgettable food  on a steam train in the Midlands. In Liverpool, meanwhile, the new  Hard Day&apos;s Night hotel pulls off its tribute to the Beatles with relative restraint and style, actually. But what about you? What&apos;s the best, worst and weirdest theme restaurant you&apos;ve ever eaten in? Can anyone recommend a theme restaurant that does genuinely good food? Have you ever been pleasantly surprised by Planet Hollywood, do you look back fondly on Damien Hirst&apos;s Pharmacy?

BG yesterday reported a 92% increase in second-quarter operating profits to \u00a31.4bn but the group&apos;s chief executive denied it was profiteering on the back of British consumers. He said the group was paid 32.8p a therm over the quarter - 15% less than the previous quarter - for its wholesale gas supplies. Frank Chapman said BG was &quot;definitely not a contributor&quot; to the trend that has seen forward spot prices rising to over \u00a31 a therm. But he declined to say whether rises in domestic bills could be justified, pointing out that BG was only one of 40 British gas suppliers.  &quot;I don&apos;t want to comment on the various studies and reports that are going on,&quot; he said, possibly referring to research put out last week by British Gas that warned that the average domestic gas bill may need to rise from about \u00a3600 to more than \u00a31,000 a year if oil prices keep rising.  A host of other suppliers are expected to announce big increases in their gas prices in the next few months, blaming booming oil prices - to which gas prices are often linked - and dwindling North Sea supplies. Centrica said last night that the BG figures were &quot;not representative of the market&quot;, pointing out that spot prices had risen from 48p last winter - a time of highest demand - to about 63p and forward prices for next winter are 94p.  &quot;It is impossible to really comment on the BG figures given we don&apos;t know how much gas it involves or over what period, but if they struck a contract quite a long time ago when the price was that kind of level then they are obliged to fulfil it,&quot; he said. Shares in BG fell 6.5% to \u00a310.66 as the City showed its concerns at the lower prices and a slowdown in production due to the Grangemouth industrial dispute and other issues. BG said it had seen a 317% rise in profits from its liquefied natural gas unit, which hugely increased its shipments and expanded its markets. Asian countries including Taiwan paid record prices for LNG in the quarter, spurred by higher crude prices.  Chapman said he was still looking at acquiring Australian utility Origin Energy, for which BG made a bid worth about \u00a36.5bn in June. BG hopes to use Origin&apos;s huge coal seam gas reserves to boost its presence in the Asia-Pacific region but a Hong Kong newspaper reported that Chinese state-controlled CITIC Resources Holdings may be willing to make a rival offer. Chapman dismissed the report as &quot;highly speculative&quot;.  BG enjoyed a number of oil and gas strikes during the quarter, including another discovery in the Santos Basin in Brazil, where previous wells indicated the existence of billions of barrels of oil.  &quot;I&apos;m extremely pleased with the way Brazil is going,&quot; Chapman said. &quot;My sense is that we&apos;re going to drill a whole sequence of successful wells.&quot;  Although it did not affect the bottom line, analysts at Cazenove said BG&apos;s exploration success was &quot;the real stand-out value driver&quot; in the quarter.  BG, originally spun out of the state-owned British Gas, said it had resumed talks with Israel on developing its gas field off the Gaza coast but added Israeli reluctance to pay world prices for gas and political problems made a deal difficult.  &quot;It&apos;s just another stage in the process which I expect to be quite a long and drawn out process,&quot; Chapman explained. &quot;The barriers relate to realism on the part of the Israelis regarding the value of gas today.&quot;  Another problem was the lack of agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority on a stable framework to export the gas.  In January BG said it was closing its Israel office because talks on the field ended in December. The Palestinian Authority had hoped developing the field and exporting gas to Israel would net it millions of dollars in taxes and royalties."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/25/theairlineindustry", "publicationDate": "2008-07-25T12:14:00Z", "tags": ["World news", "Airline industry"], "sentences": ["The worst accident happened in Taiwan in October 2000 when a Singapore Airlines 747-400 crashed and burned shortly after taking off from Taipei airport, killing 83 of the 179 people on board."], "title": "Boeing 747 safety record", "article": "The Boeing 747-400 has proved one of the most popular jets for long-haul carriers.

That dream is now about to come true, and this highly readable book traces the history of China&apos;s sporting ambition, from an obscure lecture in Tientsin in 1908 to the &quot;high-quality Olympics with Chinese characteristics&quot; that are to open in Beijing next month. Xu notes that the modern Chinese word for, sport, tiyu, didn&apos;t exist until the 1890s and that late 19th-century Chinese attitudes towards the body and physical training &quot;were ambivalent, to say the least . . . Chinese elites generally considered sports undignified - a robust body was not consistent with the idea of the cultured gentleman&quot;. But as the Chinese empire crumbled and morale was crucially undermined by the country&apos;s defeat in the Sino-Japanese war in 1895, Chinese people became convinced that their nation was a &quot;sick man&quot; whose body needed to be strengthened through a regime of rigorous physical exercise. Sun Yat-sen, China&apos;s first president, declared that &quot;If we want to make our country strong, we must first make sure our people have strong bodies.&quot; Nationalists stressed the need for shangwu or &quot;warlike spirit&quot;, and Avery Brundage, later president of the International Olympic Committee, wrote in the 1930s that as a result of physical fitness being neglected, &quot;The highly intellectual citizens of China have allowed themselves to be plundered by their own bandits for generations.&quot; China&apos;s contact with the emergent Olympic movement was slow and hesitant, and although a national Olympic committee was formed in 1922, China did not participate in an Olympiad until 1932. Its team in Los Angeles consisted of just one man, Liu Changchun, a sprinter, and he was only dispatched at the last minute due to money problems. China took part much more enthusiastically in the notorious 1936 Berlin Olympics, sending 69 athletes, but failed to win a single medal. Xu devotes little attention to these games and says even less about the 1948 London Olympics, at which the penniless Chinese team stayed in a primary school and cooked their own meals. Mao Zedong, in his first published article, declared that &quot;Physical education . . . should be the number one priority.&quot; But the Communist party had little awareness of the Olympics when it came to power in 1949, and it took some time for the new government to realise that one of China&apos;s three IOC members had chosen to remain on the mainland rather than flee to Taiwan. At the urging of the Soviet Union, China made a last-minute application to participate in the 1952 games in Helsinki, but its delegation arrived just one day before the closing ceremony. The delay was largely caused by the &quot;two Chinas&quot; dispute that continues to haunt the Olympics to this day.  Xu notes how the IOC had closed its eyes to the two-China issue since the early 50s, and how Canada lost friends by promising Beijing it would honour a one-China policy despite having committed itself to Taiwan&apos;s participation in the Olympics in 1969. China first became an Olympic powerhouse at the Los Angeles games in 1984, when it won 15 golds. At the Athens Olympics in 2004 it came second only to the United States. This book focuses on the tricky negotiations involving Beijing, Taipei and the IOC over participation, often in fascinating detail, although it is not entirely clear why so much attention is devoted to ping-pong diplomacy between Beijing and Washington, which has little direct connection to the Olympics. Xu refers to the self-proclaimed Taoist Brundage, who was IOC president from 1952 to 1972, as &quot;not particularly famous for his intellectual observations&quot; and &quot;not a good communicator&quot;, which is rather mild for someone widely regarded as being pro-Nazi. There are also many important areas which Xu neglects, including Chinese doping scandals, Tibet, and the IOC&apos;s business ties with the Beijing authorities. Nevertheless, although this book is unlikely to win many gold medals, it is a useful introduction to an awkward topic that simply won&apos;t go away. \u00b7 Michael Rank was a student in China during the cultural revolution."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/26/golf2", "publicationDate": "2008-07-26T15:55:51Z", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "sentences": ["Pressel&apos;s win was followed by Korean Inbee Park, 19, winning this year&apos;s US Women&apos;s Open, and last year another 19-year-old, Yani Tseng of Taiwan, became the youngest winner of the LPGA Championship."], "title": "Women's golf: new breed confront perils of Korea burn-out", "article": "Morgan Pressel is having the sort of career once earmarked for Michelle Wie.

With Annika Sorenstam retiring at the end of the season, Pressel, along with Natalie Gulbis and Paula Creamer, is being promoted as the new face of women&apos;s golf. &quot;We need to expand our viewership and bring more people to the LPGA and women&apos;s golf,&quot; says Pressel. &quot;That&apos;s our main goal: attract more women to play the game.&quot; Those who run golf worldwide would echo this view. The numbers who play golf regularly, on both sides of the Atlantic, are dropping steadily, and there is a strongly held view that attracting more women and girls into the game would help reverse the decline. There are only 135,000 women playing regularly in Britain, most of them in their fifties and sixties. The average number of members in Britiain&apos;s golf clubs is just over 600: the average number of girl players per club is seven. The promotion of women&apos;s golf is at least being helped by the prolific deeds of the Mexican Lorena Ochoa, who is in the middle of an extraordinary streak of form. She has won 23 times on tour, including two majors. But at 26, Ochoa is a veteran. Pressel&apos;s win was followed by Korean Inbee Park, 19, winning this year&apos;s US Women&apos;s Open, and last year another 19-year-old, Yani Tseng of Taiwan, became the youngest winner of the LPGA Championship. If youth and marketability are key issues, another is race, specifically the integration of a new generation of talented South Korean players on to the US Tour. Of the 121 non-American golfers on the LPGA Tour, 45 are Korean, an indicator of the explosion of golfing talent that some trace back to the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. The theory goes that the Games made sport a more socially acceptable pastime for women. To this can be added the power of role models such as the popular Se Ri Pak, who won the first two major championships she entered, in 1998. In 2003 Jan Stephenson, Australia&apos;s long-standing LPGA player, said: &quot;The Asians are killing our tour. They&apos;ve taken it over.&quot; She went on to criticise the Korean players for their &quot;lack of emotion, their refusal to speak English when they can speak English&quot; and for lacking sex appeal. The ripples created by Stephenson&apos;s comments are still being felt. Pressel&apos;s view, that it is important for tour players to &quot;be approachable and have great personalities with the media&quot;, unintentionally echoes Stephenson&apos;s comments. &quot;We have plenty of different types of players and we have different storylines, attracting different types of viewers. Respect the fans and the sponsors,&quot; she says, &quot;and you&apos;ve pretty much got a golden ticket.&quot; Another view on the Koreans comes from Suzann Petersen, the leading European player. &quot;They just start at such a young age and have fantastic programmes in place. But I also think it&apos;s important to keep your childhood. &quot;You only live once and I look back at my childhood and I&apos;m so happy I did all the things I did,&quot; the Norwegian says. &quot;I was into all sports and had the experience of other influences in my childhood.The Koreans come out on the LPGA Tour at 18. They are fearless and they are good but I think sometimes that if you did the same programme in Norway as they do in Korea, where they are driven so hard and so tough from that age, you will probably have more people dropping out than completing it. &quot;But what you will also see with the Koreans is that although they come out early and are very, very good you hardly see anyone staying at the top for a long, long time. I think they burn out.&quot; Against this backdrop, Sunningdale will offer a guide to the progress of the Ladies&apos; European Tour, which is undergoing something of a renaissance on and off the course. A number of British players have emerged, such as Rebecca Hudson, Lisa Hall, Henrietta Zuel and Melissa Reid. Reid benefits from a support team of specialist coaches overseen by Sir Clive Woodward, the former England rugby union coach and current elite performance director for the British Olympic Association. &quot;I don&apos;t see him [Woodward] that often,&quot; Reid, 20, who was Britain&apos;s leading amateur in 2007, says. &quot;I speak to him on the phone once a week or fortnight. &quot;I see the fitness guy, my psychologist, my golf coach Lawrence Farmer and my nutritionist. Everyone out here is talented, so to get ahead you have to have an edge, to be different. Clive&apos;s idea is that if you put together a team of experts around an athlete they can use their talent to greatest advantage. Talent is not enough.&quot; Likewise, much is expected of Zuel, who was the youngest golfer to play on the European Tour, aged 13. Five years later, she has signed up with pop impresario Simon Fuller&apos;s 19 Management company, taking her place alongside David Beckham and Claudia Schiffer. The combination of talent and marketability among the players has allowed Alexandra Armas, executive director of the Ladies&apos; European Tour, to oversee a growth in the commercial side of the women&apos;s game. Four new events have been added to the 2008 schedule, making a total of 29 tournaments with total prize money of \u00a38.5m. Not so long ago, the tour was close to going out of business after the number of events plummeted to eight in 2000 because of lack of sponsorship and the apathy of promoters. &quot;Watching good golf, watching putts go in is one part of it,&quot; Armas says. &quot;But if you have a relationship with the players that helps you feel closer to the sport. Players from different nationalities are important. &quot;Journalists are interested in national heroes. I saw at first hand the impact of Fernando Alonso on formula one in Spain. Everyone is F1 mad now. It&apos;s important to make the most of what we have, get the players out there and let the public get to know them.&quot; As Annika Sorenstam prepares to exit the world stage, Sunningdale would be a good place for the next generation of Europeans to prove they can provide a worthy successor."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/27/equestrianism", "publicationDate": "2008-07-26T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Equestrianism", "Sport"], "sentences": ["The 19-year-old, who has dual Brazilian and American citizenship, has a 14-under total of 202, while Taiwan-born Candie Kung is one shot back after a 67."], "title": "Sport in brief: Breen is king of the Queen's Cup", "article": "Irishman Shane Breen has become the first man to have his name inscribed on the Queen&apos;s Cup.

William Funnell, who watched the Irishman&apos;s round before he rode into the jump-off on Billy Birr, realised this would be a hard act to follow. &apos;Breen jumped a super round. I knew I&apos;d have to do something special to beat him,&apos; Funnell said. In the end, he opted for a slower, clear round on his home-bred mount, having wisely backed himself each way at 10-1 before the price shortened dramatically to 2-1. This was the second time Funnell finished runner-up yesterday, having handed the Longines Classic to his sole rival (Belgium&apos;s Patrik Spits) when he was eliminated for taking the wrong course on Cortaflex Mondriaan in the two-horse jump-off. Breen naturally approved of the Queen Elizabeth II Cup being opened up to men, which precipitated a similar move in today&apos;s King George V Gold Cup, formerly confined to men, but now open to women. &apos;Lady riders who are competing on teams here deserve to ride in the King&apos;s Cup, which is also the Grand Prix,&apos; Breen said.Genevieve Murphy Touring cars Priaulx hopeful of closing on leader Three-time defending champion Andy Priaulx admitted that his fourth place in qualifying for today&apos;s round of the World Touring Car Championship at Brands Hatch came as something of a surprise.  The BMW driver set a fastest time of one minute 33.307 seconds round the 3.703km former Formula One circuit to record his best qualifying performance of the year.  &apos;I am very happy with that because it was better than we expected,&apos; said Priaulx, whose BMW team-mate Augusto Farfus will start from pole position, ahead of Chevrolet duo Alain Menu and Robert Huff.  Jason Plato continued his impressive run of form to take pole position for today&apos;s British Touring Car Championship at Oulton Park and give Seat Sport UK a one-two at the front of the grid. The 2001 champion came within a whisker of breaking the 2.2-mile track qualifying record with a lap time of one minute 27.688 seconds.  He will line up alongside his team-mate Darren Turner, who also drove impressively for a time of 1:27.855. Reigning champ Fabrizio Giovanardi qualified in fifth place. Golf Reavie pulls away American Chez Reavie returned to the Canadian Open for the third round to find his two-shot overnight lead had grown to three. Reavie had left the Glen Abbey golf club, in Ontario, on Friday leading the field, with Eric Axley making a charge before second-round play was halted because of darkness.  Axley was called off the course with one hole to play and returned early yesterday to complete his round with a bogey for a four-under 67, adding a stroke to Reavie&apos;s cushion. Reavie had reached the midway mark at 13 under on 129, equalling the 36-hole record set by Scott Dunlap in 1996.  Angela Park birdied the final three holes for a four-under-par 68 to keep a one-shot lead after the third round of the Evian Masters in France.

Justin Yifu Lin, the World Bank&apos;s new chief economist, has the unenviable job of persuading governments and the public to remember their responsibilities to the developing world, even when times are hard. Affable and self-deprecating, Lin is the first holder of the post from a developing country. Until recently, he was a professor at the Beijing University&apos;s China Centre for Economic Research, which he founded, and has been a key player in advising the government on China&apos;s breakneck economic development, including serving as a deputy on the policy-making People&apos;s Congress. Economists are rarely known as fine specimens of physical fitness, but Lin arrived in China after a dramatic 2,000-metre swim for freedom. He was born and brought up in Taiwan, but during his national service, in 1979, when he was serving on Kinmen island, just off the Chinese mainland, he dived into the sea and defected to the communist state, which was just beginning to open up to the outside world. Once adopted by his new homeland, Lin gained a master&apos;s degree in economics from Beijing University, then left to study in the US before returning to take up a series of academic posts. He has written 16 books, including China Miracle, which has been translated into seven languages. China has been one of the extraordinary economic success stories of recent decades, transforming a backwater into a mighty trading power, but Lin is wary of prescribing specific recipes for other developing countries: &apos;I do not have a set of solutions I can bring to the World Bank, or through the World Bank to any other countries. I like to listen.&apos; But he does suggest that others might benefit from copying Beijing&apos;s single-minded pursuit of economic progress: &apos;If you look into the experience of China in the last 30 years, there are several things to learn. The first one certainly is commitment to reform, and a very pragmatic approach: what is the constraint, what are the opportunities?&apos; He quotes Deng Xiaoping, China&apos;s reformist leader and author of its radical shift towards a market economy. &apos;Deng Xiaoping said, &quot;To reform is just like crossing the river by searching for stepping stones.&quot; But first you need to be clear you want to cross the river.&apos; In times of economic turmoil, with widespread job losses, Lin accepts that public support for globalisation can be difficult to sustain, but says governments must help instead of changing direction. &apos;The government and civil society have an obligation to help people, by providing job training or assistance to find a new job; but you need not stop this kind of globalisation process.&apos; What if Britain had called a halt to the rapid economic and social changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution? &apos;Imagine that process had been stopped. Britain would be poorer than many countries in Africa today.&apos; The bank&apos;s economic research has been criticised in a damning report by Princeton professor Angus Deaton, commissioned by the World Bank itself, which accused it of being insufficiently rigorous and balanced and paying too little attention to academic debates in the outside world. Lin wants that to change, and is urging his staff to set up joint teams with experts in countries where the World Bank operates. &apos;That has two purposes: to better understand the opportunities and constraints in these countries, and as an important step for capacity-building in developing countries, so they have ownership of their own policies. They need to have the local capacities to come up with the solutions. That will be a win-win situation.&apos; Lin&apos;s predecessors include Nobel prize-winner Joseph Stiglitz, who was subsequently fiercely critical of the World Bank&apos;s role; but despite his background in communist China, he seems unlikely to unsettle the &apos;Washington consensus&apos; of free-market liberalism long held dear by the IMF and the bank. He learnt his craft at Chicago University in the 1980s, home of right-wing theorists Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman, and renowned as a hotbed of laissez-faire economics. Lin is coy about whether he shared the prevailing orthodoxy at his alma mater. &apos;What I learnt is an approach - to observe the world - and that was quite useful when I got back to China. Certainly there are new phenomena there which require new explanations.&apos; Just a few weeks into the job, he has already picked up an easy facility with the jargon of the Washington-based lender, chatting about how it must become a &apos;knowledge bank&apos; for development, and economists must take account of &apos;country-specific issues&apos;.  But on some questions he is more willing to take a strong stand. Farming reform has been one of the major pillars of China&apos;s economic renaissance, after the disastrous collectivisation of the Cultural Revolution. Agriculture has been a central topic of Lin&apos;s research for decades. He argues that food production should be an area of strength for many poor countries, but their farm sectors have often been stifled by subsidies in wealthier countries. &apos;In the long term, it&apos;s important to improve agriculture by investment in technology and to increase productivity. But the big question is how to remove the subsidies in the developed countries,&apos; he says. &apos;These have turned agriculture into an export. That depresses prices and destroys the incentive for farmers in developing countries to invest in agriculture.&apos; With food prices at historically high levels, he hopes America and the EU can be persuaded to dismantle these subsidies, perhaps as part of the Doha trade round being discussed in Geneva this week. &apos;But it&apos;s a long process which must be managed well.&apos; Lin arrives at the World Bank when its role is more uncertain than for many years. Campaigners are concerned that its growing focus on global warming is detracting from its core job of fighting poverty and funding economic development. Governments, including the UK&apos;s, have channelled billions of pounds into its various anti-climate change measures, but an independent report published by the bank itself last week questioned the effectiveness of much of its environmental spending. But Lin insists poverty cannot be tackled without fighting climate change. &apos;Farm incomes are very sensitive to climate. Poor farmers are going to be the first people to be hurt, and they have the least means of protecting themselves. Dealing with climate change is an integral part of this poverty reduction strategy. &apos;We know that there are new technologies available. If we make them affordable to the poor, they can leapfrog. They don&apos;t have to go through development... pollution... clean-up.&apos; He also brushes off criticisms of China&apos;s increasing involvement in Africa. Beijing has signed contracts to buy natural resources with a series of questionable regimes, but Lin says its most important link with Africa is in providing an example of economic success. &apos;China provides a role model to show that it&apos;s possible to change from a very desperate situation into a very promising, dynamic country - and that kind of role model is very important.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/nuclear.usforeignpolicy", "publicationDate": "2008-07-28T17:30:00Z", "tags": ["US foreign policy", "US news", "Iran", "India", "Pakistan", "China", "Taiwan", "World news", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The F-16s so blithely dangled before India and delivered to Pakistan will not, it seems, be sold to Taiwan, despite the Taiwan Relations Act and the threats to the island from Beijing, which has over a thousand missiles pointing at it from across the Straits, and which has not withdrawn its threat of military invasion of the democratic state.", "By openly kowtowing to Beijing and abandoning its commitments, the White House is sending signals to the PLA \u2013 and other powers in the region like Japan and South Korea, and indeed Taiwan, that they might want to consider their own nuclear programme since the US was only kidding with its defence promises.", "It does seem a lot of confusion to keep voters employed in Lockheed&apos;s plant in the Texas heartland, not least since Taiwan&apos;s order could do that as well."], "title": "Ian Williams: US arms deals to India and Pakistan are nonsensical", "article": "It&apos;s been a long time since anyone expected consistency in foreign policy from Washington, but last week saw a cluster of developments that tax belief, even in these years of incredulity that followed the declaration of the war on terror. The US is allowing Pakistan to use aid earmarked for counterterrorism to upgrade the F-16 fighter jets that the US has sold them, reversing the earlier freeze on the sales because of Pakistan&apos;s overt nuclear weapons programme. And we should remember that this was the fast breeder of nuclear programmes. Earlier this month, the brain behind the scientific part of it, Abdul Qadeer Khan, claimed that he was acting under the orders of Bush&apos;s pet president, Pervez Musharaff, in providing technology to North Korea&apos;s successful bomb project, and to the subsequently abandoned Iranian and Libyan efforts.  The F-16 sales went ahead despite reports that the Pakistani military had been reconfiguring the planes to carry nuclear payloads. Military analysts all agree that the F-16 is no use for the close-up ground support that could have lent a spurious plausibility to disguising jet sales as counterterrorism instruments. Could have, that is, if the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies were not, for many years, the main sponsors of the Taliban and even now seem somewhat under-committed to spending the $10bn in aid that Bush has given them on rooting out the fundamentalist threat. While there is a complete lack of ethics in the sale, there is, nonetheless, a certain chilling Bushian logic to it. The Pakistan F-16 sales kept the production line going in the Lockheed plant in Fort Worth,Texas. In that vein, with equally callous logic, the only plausible target for the Pakistani weaponry is India, which the Lockheed/department of defence salesmen are targeting for even bigger sales. India also has nuclear weapons, so the stakes in this macabre manoeuvre are even higher than merely cynical arms peddling. The Bush administration has of course already agreed to overlook the Indian nukes and has been preparing to roll a diplomatic juggernaut through the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by allowing Indian access to nuclear technology. To add the Through the Looking Glass ambience, part of the Indian pay-off for the US overlooking its triumphant nuclear bomb production was to gang up in the IAEA on Iran by referring to the UN security council the allegations of Teheran&apos;s nuclear programme that the US National Intelligence Estimate has since dismissed.  But no one can accuse the US of absolutely unbridled arms sales. The F-16s so blithely dangled before India and delivered to Pakistan will not, it seems, be sold to Taiwan, despite the Taiwan Relations Act and the threats to the island from Beijing, which has over a thousand missiles pointing at it from across the Straits, and which has not withdrawn its threat of military invasion of the democratic state. By openly kowtowing to Beijing and abandoning its commitments, the White House is sending signals to the PLA \u2013 and other powers in the region like Japan and South Korea, and indeed Taiwan, that they might want to consider their own nuclear programme since the US was only kidding with its defence promises. So there we have it. Under the rubric of the war on terror, you renege on your legal and moral commitments to defend a democratically elected government against overt threats from a totalitarian regime, you arm two nuclear powers that have been to war with each other three times since they were created and you encourage Israel, the only nuclear power in the Middle East, to attack a country your own intelligence agencies have determined has stopped using the equipment it got from your Pakistani ally to make bombs. It does seem a lot of confusion to keep voters employed in Lockheed&apos;s plant in the Texas heartland, not least since Taiwan&apos;s order could do that as well. If there is an ethical dimension here, it seems to be tangled up somewhere in string theory. And if it is just realpolitik, it really is an inept form of it, even by Bush administration standards."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/31/usforeignpolicy.nuclear", "publicationDate": "2008-07-31T18:00:00Z", "tags": ["US foreign policy", "US news", "China", "New Zealand", "Condoleezza Rice", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["America&apos;s neglect has been a boon for China, Taiwan and even Japan, who have all been hard at work wooing South Pacific nations.", "But the more serious issue is the battle between China and Taiwan over nationhood.", "Take Taiwanese money and you support UN resolutions endorsing Taiwan&apos;s right to a seat on international organisations.", "But before we blithely dismiss Chinese and Taiwanese efforts in the Pacific as the US simply being out-played at its own game, it&apos;s worth remembering that the question of Taiwan&apos;s independence is one of the world&apos;s most dangerous disputes."], "title": "Tim Watkin: US diplomacy down-under", "article": "While Barack Obama charmed his way across the Middle East and Europe last week trying to look presidential, every carefully chosen word soaked up by the world media sponge travelling in his entourage, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice took a near-anonymous trip down-under. Using up some of her frequent-flyer miles before she leaves office in January, Rice took a trip round the South Pacific to Australia, New Zealand and Samoa. The brief stop in Perth was informal, with the media focusing on her shopping habits and hints that she was more interested in returning to academia next year than running for high office. In Samoa she met with Pacific Island leaders, putting pressure on the interim-Fiji government, which claimed power via a military coup in 2006, to hold elections in March as promised.  The New Zealand stop was more significant - for New Zealand at least. It gets few visits from senior US political figures these days, having declared itself nuclear-free in the mid-1980s and refusing to join the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The relationship between the once-close countries has become prickly. In 2002, then-secretary of state Colin Powell described the countries as &quot;very, very, very close friends&quot;, but pointedly did not use the word &quot;allies&quot;. Rice changed all that at the weekend, saying that &quot;New Zealand is certainly seen as a friend and an ally&quot; and the countries had &quot;moved on&quot; from their nuclear dispute. (As an interesting aside, the Tehran Times latched onto that comment with a story that began: &quot;Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said Saturday that a lingering nuclear dispute between the United States and New Zealand ought to be overcome to focus on a new era of cooperation.&quot; Nice try fellas, but nuclear-free and nuclear proliferation aren&apos;t comparable). Perhaps the most interesting comment from Rice was: &quot;We have in recent years moved beyond a whole list of problems, and we have really structured our relationship and our cooperation to meet the post-September 11 challenges.&quot; Translation: These days, the US needs all the friends it can get. Problem is, the US has taken its Pacific friends for granted. That&apos;s never a good move in any relationship. The Bush administration&apos;s obsession with Iraq and Afghanistan has meant taking its eyes off too many other regions and their concerns. The Pacific Island leaders, for example, took the opportunity to remind Rice that their nations could disappear under the rising ocean within the next 50 or so years if climate change isn&apos;t taken more seriously. Some of those leaders too, should be cause for US concern, as a Congressional Research Service report last year spelled out in clear terms: &quot;In some Pacific Island countries, weak political and legal institutions, corruption, civil unrest and economic scarcity could lead to the creation of failed states or allow for foreign terrorist activity within their borders.&quot; The last comment on palm-tree terrorism may be a little exaggerated, but the other fears are well warranted. The White House seemed to have acknowledged its mistake when it promised to &quot;re-engage&quot; with the region and declared 2007 the &quot;Year of the Pacific&quot;. But just how seriously it took that declaration can be measured by the fact that it took until 2008 for Rice to pop down for a visit. America&apos;s neglect has been a boon for China, Taiwan and even Japan, who have all been hard at work wooing South Pacific nations. As that CRS report noted: &quot;China has become a growing force in the Southwest Pacific as a result, some argue, of a political vacuum created by US neglect.&quot; The report points to Chinese premier Wen Jiabao&apos;s 2006 signing of the China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Gjiding Framework, which promised $375m in development aid, China&apos;s $1bn Ramu nickel mine in Papua New Guinea, its demand for timber that has reportedly fuelled large-scale illegal logging in Indonesia and PNG and the large Chinese tuna fleet operating in Fijian waters. None of that is sinister in itself. But such aid comes with diplomatic strings attached. For a start, these countries, however small, have votes on powerful world bodies. And one vote by Kiribati or the Cooks is worth just as much as one vote by Britain or Germany. The Japanese, for example, have benefited from Pacific nations voting with them on the International Whaling Commission. But the more serious issue is the battle between China and Taiwan over nationhood. Take Chinese money and you accept the One China policy. Take Taiwanese money and you support UN resolutions endorsing Taiwan&apos;s right to a seat on international organisations. As respected Pacific correspondent Michael Field reported in 2005, the results of that game can be seen sprinkled through the islands: the $4.8m courthouse in Rarotonga, Cook Islands, paid for by China, or the three-story, $8m administration building in Tuvalu, paid for by Taipei, for example. The problem, as the CRS report points out, is that such aid &quot;may exacerbate underlying political, social and economic tensions in the region&quot;. The US should recognise the aid-for-favours agenda. It&apos;s followed the same policy model for decades. But before we blithely dismiss Chinese and Taiwanese efforts in the Pacific as the US simply being out-played at its own game, it&apos;s worth remembering that the question of Taiwan&apos;s independence is one of the world&apos;s most dangerous disputes. Nuclear powers are lined up on either side. The spread of that dispute out into the Pacific should be of concern to us all, and of particular concern to America. If the &quot;land of the free&quot; wants to maintain influence in the region, if Rice&apos;s successor wants to continue her talk of &quot;transformational diplomacy&quot;, then the next president had better widen his foreign policy focus."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/02/gao.xingjian", "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Yet since 1989 all his work has been banned in mainland China (most has been published in Taiwan).", "They have been widely staged in Europe, Taiwan and Hong Kong - where Tales of Mountains and Seas (1993) premiered in June at a festival devoted to Gao&apos;s work.", "Even the Chinese Communist party couldn&apos;t make me change a play; why should I accept correction from America?&quot; It was while directing his modern take on a Peking opera, Snow in August (2002), in Taiwan, that Gao collapsed and later had major heart surgery."], "title": "Interview: Gao Xingjian", "article": "In May this year, when news of the Sichuan earthquake reached the Nobel laureate Gao Xingjian at his home in Paris, he remembered living through a similar disaster in China more than 30 years ago: &quot;Even though I was quite far away then, I was terrified.&quot; That earthquake, in Tangshan, near Beijing, was one of the 20th century&apos;s worst in terms of lives lost. &quot;Afterwards there were terrible downpours, but no one wanted to stay in the buildings. I can imagine the fear in Sichuan.&quot;  It was the tail-end of the cultural revolution, the collapse of which was accelerated by the aftermath of the 1976 quake. When the 10-year terror began in 1966, Gao felt compelled to burn a suitcase-full of all his manuscripts since adolescence, in case he was denounced. But he was still sent for &quot;re-education&quot; in the countryside. Labouring in the fields, he began again, hiding his work in a hole in the ground, when &quot;to write, even in secret, was to risk one&apos;s life&quot;. As Gao said in 2000 when he became the first (and only) writer in Chinese to win the Nobel prize for literature, &quot;it was only during this period, when literature became utterly impossible, that I came to comprehend why it was so essential.&quot; Gao, who was first published when he was almost 40, has written more than 20 plays, short stories, essays, criticism and two semi-autobiographical novels: Soul Mountain (1990), based on a journey down the Yangtse river; and One Man&apos;s Bible (1999), memories of the cultural revolution spliced with episodes in the life and loves of a world-famous man of the theatre. The novels were translated into English in 2000 and 2002, followed by Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather (2004), a collection of short stories. His Nobel lecture is the title essay of The Case for Literature (2007). Yet since 1989 all his work has been banned in mainland China (most has been published in Taiwan).  A pioneer of experimental theatre in China in the early 1980s, Gao fell foul of renewed purges, and left for Germany, then France in 1987. But it was his reaction to the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 that he believes sealed his fate. &quot;I heard the news on the radio that people were gunned down, and right then, I knew I was looking at exile,&quot; he says. He condemned the crackdown on French television, publicly resigned from the Chinese Communist party he had joined in 1962, tore up his Chinese passport and applied for political asylum. He has lived in Paris for 21 years as a painter and writer/director, becoming a French citizen in 1998. For Jung Chang, Gao has &quot;immortalised the memories of a nation suffering from forced amnesia; my own memories flooded back reading him&quot;. Ma Jian, the London-based author of Beijing Coma, sees Gao as &quot;both a linguistic innovator and a writer of integrity, whose work constantly reaffirms the importance of the individual over the collective. He was one of the first writers of the post-Mao era to absorb developments in western literature and philosophy, and meld them with Chinese classical traditions to create a new kind of drama and fiction.&quot; By contrast, the critic Julia Lovell commends his shorter fiction yet feels the novels are a &quot;sprawling, self-indulgent take on the horrors of political oppression&quot;. Aged 68, Gao lives in Paris&apos;s 2nd arrondissement with C\u00e9line Yang, a novelist who left China after 1989. Gao, who also writes in French, has translated and directed plays in his adopted language, and was awarded the L\u00e9gion d&apos;honneur in 2000. He sees himself as a &quot;fragile man who has managed not to be crushed by authority and to speak to the world in his own voice&quot;. As he pointed out recently at Warwick University, on a rare visit to Britain, most of his life&apos;s work has been done since leaving China. While the Swedish academy saw him as a &quot;perspicacious sceptic&quot; possessed of &quot;bitter insights&quot;, for Ma, Gao is a &quot;tranquil yet engaged presence; a very composed, mild-mannered man, but a passionate reader and artist&quot;. Speaking in French, smiling readily though he seems frail, Gao recalls the Nobel prize as a &quot;whirlwind. I was carried away, and it was difficult to organise my life. Very soon after, I fell ill, and had two big heart operations one after the other. It was because of the fatigue and pressure. I became an ornament on the political scene.&quot; The official Chinese reaction to the Nobel was predictably hostile. The head of the Chinese Writers&apos; Association said the prize had been &quot;used for political purposes and thus has lost its authority&quot;. According to Ma, that body had &quot;campaigned for years for the Nobel prize to be awarded to one of their state-sanctioned writers, so they were furious when it went to a political exile&quot;. Yet Gao has also been attacked by dissidents - notably for his play Escape (1989), written within months of the Tiananmen Square massacre, and the ostensible trigger for all his work being banned in China. Its three characters take refuge from the army crackdown in a warehouse, amid sexual tensions and cynicism about self-proclaimed heroes. &quot;Exiled writers said my play blackened the democracy movement,&quot; Gao says. &quot;Even today, those attacks continue.&quot; In Ma&apos;s view, &quot;It was criticised by the pro-democracy activists because it failed to show the students in a heroic light.&quot; According to Gao, a writer&apos;s only responsibility is &quot;to the language he writes in&quot;. Determined to rid himself of others&apos; ideologies, to live, as he says, &quot;without isms&quot;, he advocates a &quot;cold literature&quot;, detached from both political agendas and consumerist pressures, whose purpose is to bear witness. His essays express a loathing for Nietzsche&apos;s idea of the Superman and and its hold over Chinese thought. &quot;Many intellectuals feel themselves to be Supermen who are spokesmen for the people,&quot; he says. &quot;But in my opinion, they&apos;re to be pitied. Under Mao&apos;s dictatorship, these poor sheep suffered the same fate as everyone else. I don&apos;t want to be a strong hero who can save society. I just want to save myself.&quot;  He was born in 1940, the eldest of two brothers, in Ganzhou. Shortly after the Communist revolution of 1949, the family moved to Nanjing. His father was a senior employee in the Bank of China, and his mother an amateur actor. It was a &quot;well-to-do, protected childhood, and my parents were very open-minded - which was rare. It&apos;s like a lost paradise.&quot; His mother read western literature in translation, from Balzac and Zola to Steinbeck, and he grew up with both western and Chinese classics. His love of theatre comes from his mother, with whom he first acted on stage, aged five. She also encouraged him to keep a diary. But when Gao was 20, during the &quot;great leap forward&quot;, she drowned at a rural labour camp. &quot;Even though she wasn&apos;t really an intellectual, she was sent away for re-education just like all the others who were not from Communist &apos;red&apos; families,&quot; he says. As a child he played the violin and flute, and painted, but opted to study French literature at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute, drawn to such dramatists as Genet and Artaud. After graduating in 1962, he worked at the Foreign Languages Press, translating French classics. But in 1966-76, all foreign-language books were banned.  In One Man&apos;s Bible, the narrator is both participant in the cultural revolution and victim. After protesting against Red Guards&apos; beating of a colleague at his workplace, Gao was treated as a hero, and led a rival Red Guard faction. The Red Guard, he explains, was initially composed of &quot;children of high-up party executives, who felt like mowing down and killing old people like their parents. Other youths reacted and set up a rebellious Red Guard faction. All young people, to protect themselves, had to join one or the other. But once I got in, I saw it wasn&apos;t really a way out. Experience has taught me that any kind of political grouping is oppressive. It&apos;s the blind mass that crushes the individual.&quot; The novel also reflects Gao&apos;s experience of being informed on by his first wife. On this he will say nothing, other than to allude to Stalinist Russia and East Germany. After Mao&apos;s death in 1976, Gao translated Beckett and Ionesco, and visited France and Italy. In his first book, essays on the modern novel, he took issue with Mao&apos;s guidelines for literature urging didactic, realist art. In Ma&apos;s view, the book &quot;influenced a generation of writers by introducing them to the concepts of stream of consciousness, surrealism and black humour.&quot; Gao, Ma adds, was &quot;the &apos;elder brother&apos; of the small band of dissident Beijing artists and writers that I belonged to. He could speak foreign languages and had travelled abroad. We all looked up to him.&quot; Made artistic director of the People&apos;s Art Theatre in Beijing in 1981, Gao broke with realism in experimental plays such as Absolute Signal (1982), about the change of heart of a would-be train robber. It startled Ma by exploring, &quot;in a nuanced way, the psychology of a &apos;bad&apos; individual. It heralded a new kind of drama, in opposition to the one-dimensional propaganda of the cultural revolution&quot;. Yet Gao became an early casualty of a renewed drive in 1983 against &quot;spiritual pollution&quot; and western modernism. His play Bus Stop (1983), a take on Waiting for Godot, was banned after 10 performances.  &quot;I&apos;d already self-censored,&quot; Gao says. &quot;Then I was censored by others. That&apos;s when I decided to write just for myself.&quot; His resolve coincided with being diagnosed with lung cancer - the disease from which his father had died. &quot;After Bus Stop, they threatened to send me back to work camp. Then this shadow was found on my lungs. I went back to my hometown and had more tests - and by a miracle it had disappeared.&quot; The reprieve made him realise that &quot;if you want to do anything, do it now, without compromise or concession, because you have only one life.&quot; He fled to the forest highlands of south-west China, ostensibly to research woodcutters&apos; lives. For five months he tracked the Yangtse riverfrom its source, from Sichuan&apos;s giant panda reserve to the China sea. &quot;I was looking for a place of refuge. It was also a spiritual and cultural quest, to find the origin of Chinese culture, the source that had not yet been polluted by politics.&quot; The result, completed in Paris after more of his plays had been banned in rehearsal in Beijing, was Soul Mountain, which took seven years to write. The novelist and film-maker Xiaolu Guo read a pirated copy and found it &quot;very beautiful and poetic - intimate but epic&quot;. &quot;The novel in Chinese sensibility is 2,000 years old,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s the language of real people from the streets - the non-official version.&quot; For Gao, the &quot;tiny history of a few individuals in a novel can&apos;t be revised or manipulated. It goes to the heart of human nature. If it&apos;s still read, it&apos;s still valuable.&quot; Though it reads like an autobiographical monologue, Soul Mountain shifts viewpoints - a technique repeated in One Man&apos;s Bible and Gao&apos;s plays. &quot;Literature can&apos;t merely be an expression of self - that would be unbearable,&quot; Gao says. &quot;You have to be critical not just of society and others, but of yourself: each subject has three pronouns: &apos;I&apos;, &apos;you&apos;, and &apos;he&apos; or &apos;she&apos;.&quot; He sees such self-scrutiny as a safeguard: &quot;If you&apos;re not perfectly conscious of yourself, that self can be tyrannical; in relationship to others, anyone can become a tyrant. That&apos;s why no one can be a Superman. You have to go beyond yourself with a &apos;third eye&apos; - self-awareness - because the one thing you cannot flee is yourself. That&apos;s why Greek tragedy is still the tragedy of human beings today.&quot; Gao&apos;s later plays have been called a modern Zen theatre, combining modernist techniques with traditional Chinese drama and ritual, from masks and shadow play to opera. They have been widely staged in Europe, Taiwan and Hong Kong - where Tales of Mountains and Seas (1993) premiered in June at a festival devoted to Gao&apos;s work. But they are rarely seen in the English-speaking world. Escape was commissioned by a US theatre company, but premiered in Sweden after Gao refused to revise it. &quot;When the company asked me to change the text, I understood what they wanted: there was no American-style hero,&quot; he says. &quot;I said, no. Even the Chinese Communist party couldn&apos;t make me change a play; why should I accept correction from America?&quot; It was while directing his modern take on a Peking opera, Snow in August (2002), in Taiwan, that Gao collapsed and later had major heart surgery. In Marseilles rehearsing his play The Man Who Questions Death (2003), he collapsed again. He has co-directed a 90-minute film, Silhouette/Shadow (2006), that reflects his brush with death. Showing him painting, reciting poetry and rehearsing actors, it captures a flow of images and memories as he is rushed to hospital in an ambulance. A &quot;cinepoem or modern fable - neither fiction nor autobiography nor documentary&quot;, it was filmed over four years, without funding. &quot;Since childhood I&apos;d dreamed of making a film, but producers in France and Germany wanted to make commercial films with chinoiserie. I refused.&quot; The film, which has no dialogue and might be released only on the internet, is part of a life&apos;s experimentation.Though he enjoys dancing, swimming in the sea and cooking seafood, Gao says he works &quot;non-stop, 12 hours a day&quot;, and never takes summer holidays &quot;or even weekends, because freedom of expression is so precious to me&quot;. The market pressures China now shares with the west are, he believes, &quot;harder to resist than political and social customs&quot;. He feels lucky that his ink paintings were selling in Europe before he fled, and have been widely exhibited. &quot;I could make a living, so I could write books that didn&apos;t sell much. I always understood that literature can&apos;t be a trade; it&apos;s a choice.&quot; Painting, he says, &quot;begins where language fails&quot;, and he works listening to music - often Bach. Ma sees his paintings as &quot;infused with the still, reflective quality of Zen Buddhism that I think he strives to achieve in his writing.&quot; To Ma, who believes that One Man&apos;s Bible is about the &quot;burden of painful memories, and how they corrupt the present and destroy oneself and those around one&quot;, it is a &quot;tragedy that a writer of such calibre is condemned in his own homeland&quot;. Guo feels Gao&apos;s voice is crucial for its &quot;stubborn, personal view of our history. The kids born after the 1980s know nothing about the past - the tragedy and sorrow of my father&apos;s generation - and how society dedicated to a collective dream ruined people and invaded their lives.&quot; Gao sees his work as an affirmation of the self in the face of efforts to extinguish it. Recalling a time when it was &quot;impossible to say freely what you thought, even in your family&quot;, he says: &quot;Everything people say in those circumstances is false; everybody is wearing a mask. It&apos;s in literature that true life can be found. It&apos;s under the mask of fiction that you can tell the truth.&quot; Gao on Gao &quot;Without Isms is neither nihilism nor eclecticism; nor is it egotism or solipsism. It opposes totalitarian dictatorship but also opposes the inflation of the self to God or Superman. It hates seeing other people trampled on like dog shit. Without Isms detests politics and does not take part in politics, but is not opposed to other people who do. If people want to get involved in politics, let them go right ahead. What Without Isms opposes is the foisting of a particular brand of politics on to the individual by means of abstract collective names such as &apos;the people&apos;, &apos;the race&apos; or &apos;the nation&apos;.&quot; (The idea behind it is that we need to bid goodbye to the 20th century, and to put a big question mark over those &quot;isms&quot; that dominated it.) \u00b7 From The Case for Literature, translated by Mabel Lee, published by Yale University Press"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/03/uspga.golf", "publicationDate": "2008-08-02T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["US PGA", "Golf", "Sport", "US PGA 2008"], "sentences": ["Within a fortnight he had won the 2001 Mercuries Masters in Taiwan and was in a position to give the cheque straight back."], "title": "World of Dan", "article": "Daniel Chopra is worthy of support in this week&apos;s USPGA Championship, if only because he is almost certainly the only player on the American golf tour who is pro Democrat.  The 1993 United States Ryder Cup team refused to meet the then President, Bill Clinton, on the grounds that he was thinking what a pro golfer would regard as the unthinkable. That is to say, he was considering increasing taxes. What&apos;s more, he was, in the words of Tom Lehman, &apos;a draft-dodging baby killer&apos;.  Chopra, in contrast, plays a round with Clinton every year and has supper with him afterwards. This annual meeting which was initiated after Chopra&apos;s wife, Samantha, saw him in a shopping mall and, thinking &apos;seize the day&apos;, introduced herself as the wife of a pro golfer who supported the President&apos;s policies.  &apos;Dan had always said he was one of his dream four-ball pairings so I went up to him and asked if he wanted a game,&apos; says Samantha. Clinton was as stunned as only a man who has been waiting five decades for a golf partner who shared his enthusiasm for the politics of triangulation can be stunned. He promised to ring in a year&apos;s time to arrange a round when the Chopras were back in town, came good on the promise, and now it is an annual fixture.  &apos;Everyone criticises him for taking mulligans [shots retaken],&apos; says Chopra, &apos;but I say fair enough because he never has time to hit balls so he has to get his practising in while he is playing. Because they close down the course when he is on it you can get round in under three hours.  &apos;If I could vote I would vote for Barack Obama because, like Bill Clinton, he&apos;s not just an American leader, he&apos;s a world leader. What Clinton is so good at is that when he is talking to people he makes them feel their country is the most important country, whether it be Uganda or Northern Ireland. When you are with him he makes you feel you are the only person with him. When I asked him what was the neatest thing about being President, he didn&apos;t go for the usual perks, like Air Force One, but instead said it was being able to invite great musicians to come and play.&apos;  Not only his politics mean the 34-year-old Chopra stands out from the crowd, there is also his peripatetic upbringing. Born in Stockholm to a Swedish mother and an Indian father, he had lived in Sweden, Hemel Hempstead and India before turning pro and playing on just about all the major tours in the world. This makes him, to be portentous, the first golfer of the globalisation age.  He is both a Swede who is fanatical about cricket and an Indian who is more likely than not to represent Europe in a Ryder Cup, possibly even next month as the captain&apos;s pick.  Above all, however, Chopra is his own man. There is no hole in which to pigeon him, which makes him admirable if not endorsable. He must be the only top-100 golfer - he is currently ranked 89th in the world - without a main sponsor in any of his homelands. There is no entourage. It is just Dan, Sam and Cosmo, a dog they describe as a &apos;puggle&apos;. When they win they share all the proceeds, when they lose there are no PRs and yes men to cushion the blows.  As with many a European player his introduction to the game was miniature golf. &apos;I loved putt-putt and watching on the TV, which was not that often in those days,&apos; Chopra says. He first played the game properly in Delhi. His parents had divorced, his mother had remarried and &apos;the original idea was that I would stay in India for a few months, maybe six, and that became a year, two years and then eight years&apos;. His grandfather, Dev, who had worked for the Indian Tobacco Company, helped found the Delhi Golf Club and his uncle, Praveen, gave him his first few lessons. &apos;It was very tough for us, because it is such a busy golf club and during the winter there were not enough tee times in the day to accommodate kids,&apos; he says. &apos;So we used to bet on par-three chipping and putting competitions. It is probably why I am one of the better putters because all I used to do was chip and putt, chip and putt, chip and putt.&apos;.  &apos;It may have seemed I was a spoilt little brat because even though I was eight I had a caddy. He needed the rupees more than me.&apos; His name is Jaichand and he caddied for Chopra&apos;s uncle and still caddies for Daniel when he plays in India. In return, the Chopras buy a couple of buffalo for his village every year.  &apos;I was quite good, quite quickly, and when I was 12 I dreamed of becoming a golf pro. By 14 I was in no doubt about what I would do with my life,&apos; Chopra says. &apos;I was spending far more days away from school than at school. My grandparents were relatively conservative but as modern as an old Indian couple could be.  &apos;I was thinking all the stuff I would ever need to learn I could learn later. I guess I was smart enough to know that 14 to 18 was a vital stage. If you&apos;re good at 14 but then don&apos;t play much till 16 and you grow a foot and a half then all the skills you&apos;ve learned go out of the window. Golf is a physically technical sport.&apos;  Chopra made rapid progress. In 1988 he was the youngest ever winner of the All India Junior Championship and progressed to become the first player from India to win the Doug Sanders World Junior title, in Aberdeen in 1991. It made little impact in his homeland. &apos;The people at the Delhi golf club were very nonchalant about it.&apos;  &apos;While playing as an amateur I kept a statistical record of how much I would have won had I been a pro and I realised I could pay my way,&apos; Chopra says. The Indian Tour had a solid infrastructure, the legacy of Empire, but was pretty small beer. &apos;When I was a junior, any time a golfer with white skin appeared it was a huge event. Now there are two European Tour events in India and, in the Indian Open, you are playing for a million dollars. Golf has grown exponentially.&apos;  Chopra, now playing as a Swede, turned out on the European Tour for the first time in 1996 and for a few years performed respectably. &apos;I was keeping my card but I was treading water,&apos; he says. To try to get ahead he decided to play the Japanese Tour as well in 2000. &apos;I succeeded in losing my card on both. Basically I was suddenly almost broke with nowhere to play.&apos; He could not even afford to get to qualifying school in America to attempt to make the PGA Tour. His friend Jeev Milkha Singh stepped in with a $5,000 loan. Within a fortnight he had won the 2001 Mercuries Masters in Taiwan and was in a position to give the cheque straight back. &apos;To win I had to two putt from the back fringe straight down one of the grainiest greens in Asia. I thought my first putt was perfect and it trickled, trickled, trickled until it was maybe 18 inches from the hole. As I put my marker down I thought, &quot;My God, what if you miss this?&quot; And I never forget saying to myself, &quot;One, my grandma could make this putt with one hand, and two, I could make this with one hand and never ever miss.&quot;&apos;  The next credit crunch came in 2003 when he reached final qualifying for the European Tour in the same week as second-stage qualifying for the PGA Tour in America, the two being scheduled against each other to deter golfers from playing both tours. &apos;I thought, &quot;If I go to America and miss I&apos;ll have nowhere to go,&quot;&apos; he says. &apos;I rolled the dice and pulled out of European qualifying school.  &apos;Looking back it was a ballsy decision. I had to make a five-footer and it was the biggest putt of my career. If I had missed it I would have been mixing concrete.&apos;  The necessity to achieve the cut to earn the money for the next tournament had a detrimental effect on his game. &apos;I developed bad habits, I was playing to make the cut rather than win.&apos; It needed Olaf Skipper, who had worked with Jesper Parnevik, to help him undo these habits. &apos;He explained everything using scientific techniques, demonstrating why I should do something that worked because I am not the kind of person who does something because someone tells me to do it.&apos;  Chopra&apos;s game came together and he was rewarded with his first tournament victory at the Ginn sur Mer Classic in Port St Lucie, Florida, late last year. &apos;They couldn&apos;t have made it more difficult mentally.&apos; At one stage during the last round he was four shots clear but the play was constantly interrupted. &apos;It was stop start, stop start, we started at dawn and by sunset we still hadn&apos;t finished.&apos; And by then he was in a three-way tie for the lead with three holes to play. Undaunted, he managed to get some sleep before closing out the win.  It was his 133rd start on the US tour and his first win. It lifted a burden because three starts later he won the Mercedes Championship in Hawaii, the opening event of 2008. &apos;The human mind is a horrible thing, always looking for worst-case scenarios. Golf is a hugely mental game. It is about succeeding against yourself. You keep believing that round the corner is the perfect round of golf when you know for a fact that no one has ever played one.&apos;  To relax there is the cricket. Growing up in India his first heroes were Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar. &apos;I also loved the West Indies team except when they played India because they beat the crap out of us.  &apos;I&apos;ve always said that if India and Pakistan had a combined team they would be world-beaters. They would have the best batsmen, the best bowlers and the best supporters. The IPL has changed everything. When Shoaib Aktar got out Verinder Sehwag in Calcutta the whole stadium erupted. It was Indians cheering a Pakistani for getting an Indian batsman out. If you&apos;d said that would happen people would say you were crazy. But it happened.  &apos;I paid for my subscription to watch the IPL in the United States and I was so keen I was considering becoming a part owner of a team until I discovered how much it would cost. I might have to win a couple of majors before they take me seriously.&apos;  Chopra has ambitious plans for a golf tournament tie-in with the IPL players. Perhaps &apos;A Round with Tendukar&apos; might attract the sponsors and TV interest. And then, so fluid is the Indian economy, so pregnant with potential, then ka-boom the whole thing might explode. Chopra laughs. &apos;Jeev and I might be sitting in our wheelchairs one day saying these bloody idiots are getting all the money and all the recognition.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/03/china.olympicgames2008", "publicationDate": "2008-08-02T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Olympics 2008", "China holidays", "World news", "Sport", "Travel", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["\u00b7 Confusion and disagreement about the representation of China and Taiwan within the IOC resulted in the All-China Sports Federation announcing its withdrawal from the IOC in 1958."], "title": "China bid to top Olympics medal table takes place against extraordinary social change", "article": "Yang Cuiping was a 16-year-old peasant girl when she was plucked from a remote village in north-west China and packed off on a programme to build a strong national rowing squad. Her long arms and 5ft 9in frame had caught the eye of a coach looking for recruits to a sport state planners had targeted as a potential source of easy Olympic medals. But for Yang, the invitation to take to the water was a surprise. &apos;When they told me I had been chosen for aquatics, I didn&apos;t understand what they were talking about,&apos; she recalls. &apos;I hadn&apos;t even seen a boat before. My village was in such a dry area that I rarely even saw water.&apos; Finding rowers in one of the most arid provinces in China was only part of the problem for the sporting mandarins. There was also the little matter of where to train. In a sign of the national prestige at stake, 2,000 soldiers were deployed for three months in 1998 to dig a 1.5 mile-long lake. The country&apos;s then President, Jiang Zemin, came to watch the patriotic shovelling marathon that created Yang&apos;s new home: the Shaanxi Aquatic Sports Training Centre. &apos;The first thing they had to teach me was how to swim,&apos; she remembers of her first lesson. That was 10 years ago. Today - after weightlifting and rowing almost every day in the interim - the former peasant girl has gained heft and prestige. She has legs like pillars, a deep voice and a clutch of medals, including an Asian Championships gold. The team, too, is stronger. With similar training centres built across the country in the past 10 years, China&apos;s rowers have come from nowhere to be on the brink of global domination at this week&apos;s Olympics. It is the same in diving, shooting and weight-lifting. This has led to accusations overseas of a factory-like production of athletes, suspicions of doping, and criticism about inhumane training of young athletes who have little knowledge about what they are letting themselves in for. But China&apos;s sports authorities deny cheating and cruelty, saying that economic development, careful state planning and hard work by athletes and coaches are the only secrets of success. The stakes are high. Ask anyone in China how their country will fare in the Beijing Olympics and the most common prediction is it will top the gold medal table for the first time in history. It is far from impossible. China&apos;s gold haul was the fourth-largest in Atlanta in 1996, third in Sydney in 2000, and second in Athens in 2004. The improvement shows how far globalisation and market-driven economic development has come and the lengths to which the communist state is willing to go to build sporting power.  But how is this mix of influences reflected in the country&apos;s sporting culture? And what clues does sport provide to China&apos;s future relations with the outside world? Some of the answers are to be found on the Old Silk Road, the ancient route between East and West. Formerly traversed by camels, exotic caravans and traders of fabrics, spices and ideas, it is now crossed by cars, business delegations and oil pipelines. In sport, too, it has undergone a transformation as a nation builds its Olympic strength and its people explore how to enjoy a degree of wealth and leisure time unthinkable in the past. The journey starts in the stables and martial arts halls of Xinjiang, the westernmost of China&apos;s regions. Horse-riding and fighting contests are among the country&apos;s oldest sports. Given the belief in China that the further you move from the coast the less developed the area, this most inland of provinces ought to be a bastion of tradition. Yet, even here, globalisation and the quest for Olympic success have subverted local culture. On the edge of the regional capital, Urumqi, Ji Desheng rides an immaculately groomed German horse past a cluster of scruffy urban tower blocks. The horseman once dreamed of being an athlete. He was provincial champion in the 110m hurdles at the age of 16, but the local sports authorities decided he was better suited for dressage. Ji was far from convinced. &apos;I was born into a farmer&apos;s family, so I didn&apos;t know how to ride a horse. The closest I had come was a ride on the back of my neighbour&apos;s nag. I had never heard of Olympic horse riding. You must think that&apos;s funny. But in China this event only has a history of 20 years. It&apos;s very new.&apos; In Beijing, the host nation will have its first competitor in the dressage event - Liu Lina, an ethnically Russian rider who entered the Xinjiang riding school at the same time as Ji. Although she is unlikely to win a medal, her participation means that for the first time China is fielding an athlete in each of the 28 sports on the Olympic roster. It is an expensive boast. Competitors need to spend \u00a31.25m on a good horse and training. Most are millionaires. Ji, however, is a civil servant with a government salary of about 1,000 yuan (\u00a380) a month. He could earn more as a migrant worker on a building site, but he insists he is happy. Just as the wild traditions of horse racing have been tamed for the sake of the Olympics, so has much of the martial philosophy taken an international bent. Urumqi&apos;s latest social phenomenon is the taekwondo mum. At a private martial arts gym, teachers say that rather than have their children take up wushu (kung fu) - which is indigenous and traditional, but not Olympic - more and more parents are opting for Korea&apos;s most famous sporting export. &apos;When I started in 2001 it was extremely popular because China had just won its first gold medal in the sport,&apos; says Shang Haofei, the instructor. &apos;At the peak after the Athens Olympics, our hall was too small for all the students who wanted to take up taekwondo.&apos; As boys and girls yell and kick on the mats, their coach says he expects China to win one or two women&apos;s golds in taekwondo in Beijing - and perhaps even a rare medal in the men&apos;s competition. The future looks even brighter. If the number and enthusiasm of his students and their parents are anything to go by, China will be very strong in 10 years&apos; time. Although winner-takes-all competition is not an entirely alien concept in China, it runs counter to the Taoist philosophy of the ancients and the communist ideology of the elderly. Rather than competitive sport, the traditional focus was on exercise, but this belief has been buffeted by a modern history of political turmoil and breakneck development. These trends are evident at the next city along the silk road, Lanzhou. Early in the morning, against a backdrop of tower blocks and ancient pagodas near the municipal stadium, about 20 mostly middle-aged men and woman are practising tai chi in an empty tennis court.  They gracefully and slowly shift their balance to a scratchy traditional melody played on a portable CD player. At the end of the session, a retired civil servant who only wants to give his surname, Feng, describes what a luxury it is to burn calories on exercise. &apos;In the 1960s there was a time when we didn&apos;t even have enough to eat - everyone in the nation suffered. In those days, we really couldn&apos;t think about exercise,&apos; he recalls. Now, China&apos;s booming economy gives the government huge sums to invest in its Soviet-style sports school system. Many of the promising young athletes corralled into these institutions have no idea what they are letting themselves in for, but compared with the dull, predictable life of a poor country village they and their parents are willing to accept the dramatic change in lifestyle. We visit the Lanzhou sports school, the most prestigious in Gansu province. Teachers proudly boast that several of the school&apos;s alumni are on Olympics hockey teams. It is far from an indigenous sport. Until 2000, there were only about 200 players in a country of more than a billion people. But with the help of foreign coaches and public money, the women&apos;s national team has made remarkable progress. They came fourth in Athens and expect a first medal - possibly even a gold - in Beijing. Here, as in other sports, the secret of success appeared to be selection at a young age - in this case about 13 or 14 - and relentless training. In what is becoming a familiar refrain, Wei Lingdi, a cheerful 14-year-old, says she never heard of hockey before she was recruited in her village of Lingxia. &apos;A coach came to my school one day and said I was fit for hockey after I did some running and jumping tests.&apos; Her hero is Na Yubo, star of the men&apos;s hockey team. &apos;I hope China can win a gold this time. They have a chance,&apos; she says. Critics say the Soviet-style training system is out of step with the times. A big medal haul in Beijing might strengthen those in favour of maintaining the status quo. In private, sports officials say they expect China to win 40 golds this year, the bulk of them in diving, table tennis, women&apos;s weightlifting, gymnastics, shooting, badminton and kayaking. One sports administrator said the system will have achieved its purpose if China comes top of the gold medal table in Beijing: &apos;We used to be called the sick man of Asia. We built this system to show we are strong. Once we have proved our strength, I think we will change and concentrate on soft power.&apos; The Shaanxi government is trying to strike a balance between national power and individual wellbeing. Under the imposing ramparts of the city wall, it has invested in a three million yuan exercise park, packed with keep-fit equipment and enthusiasts. Opened last year, the sporting &apos;Silk Road&apos; - as the half-mile thoroughfare is inevitably called - is a hive of activity. Here, more than anywhere on my journey, the mood is relaxed and cheerful. People throng to use the bright red-and-yellow exercise equipment - the back stretchers, wrist twirlers, hip swivellers and thigh pumpers.  At weekends, families send representatives at 3am to secure one of the 30 outdoor table-tennis tables for the day, then invite their relatives to come and play in turns. There is the inevitable aerobics class and, strangest of all, a large group of people who stand among the shrubs shouting the numbers from one to 40 in unison. If synchronised counting ever becomes an Olympic event, China will clean up. In diving, that is entirely possible. China has a real chance of becoming the first country in Olympic history to win all eight medals in the sport. At Xi&apos;an&apos;s diving pool, the secret of success is immediately apparent: start early and train hard. As a dozen young divers, some just six years old, plummeted stylishly again and again from the high diving platform, three tiny girls whimpered in pain as instructors ordered them to hold a handstand for minute after minute by the side of the pool. &apos;That&apos;s cruel,&apos; said a watching Chinese woman disapprovingly. &apos;I would never let my children do that.&apos; Enduring pain is necessary to achieve success, according to one of China&apos;s top diving coaches, Zhang Ting, a firm believer in the need for athletes to chi ku (swallow bitterness). He says the little girls sobbing by the pool are following in the teardrops of champions. Tian Liang - a diving gold winner in Athens - cried when he was a child under Zhang&apos;s tutelage. Qin Kai, a top medal prospect in Beijing, also sobbed at times. &apos;Of course they cried sometimes,&apos; says Zhang. &apos;But they have tough characters. They are not afraid of hardship or pain.&apos; But why is it necessary to drive a young child to tears? &apos;There are exercises you can only do when a child is young,&apos; he replies with an amiable smile. &apos;If you don&apos;t put pressure on their joints then, it is impossible later. It&apos;s painful, but necessary. Coaches must push, but they must also know how far to go not to hurt them. You need a good combination of strictness and love.&apos; In other sports, size is more important - and the government appears to be discreetly trying to influence this too. Top basketball coach Wang Libin says the government encouraged the exceptionally tall mother and father of Yao Ming, the 7ft 6in superstar of the American basketball league, to marry. They did the same for his own parents, and for him and his wife - both basketball players. Their daughter is only 15, but she is 6ft 4in tall and dreams of playing in the 2012 London Olympics. Now, he says, tall people are exempted from the one-child policy so that they can breed more tall offspring. Wang carried his nation&apos;s flag at the opening ceremony of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, when China returned to the Olympics after decades in isolation. It was a turning point - the opening and reform policy had just begun. China was again finding its place in the international community. Wang earned a state salary of 70 yuan per month at that time. Yao Ming was criticised this year because he only donated \u00a31m to the Sichuan earthquake relief fund. Despite the money and overseas experience, the current Chinese team will do well to get into the last eight, Wang predicts. Sporting tastes are clearly changing, along with diets, incomes, access to information and the environment. We move east beyond the Silk Road to the steel-and-coal city of Taiyuan, one of the most polluted places on Earth. At a local sports centre, a new generation of young sporting consumers are playing pick-up games on the basketball courts near a billboard picture of Yao Ming advertising Coca-Cola. Basketball is increasingly more popular than football among the young. For 17-year-old Wang Runyuan the biggest sporting heroes are all from American basketball. On those rare occasions when he is not doing homework, he watches foreign sport on TV. He plays too - as much for the exercise as the fun. &apos;I need to lose weight, so I play about three times a week now,&apos; he says in remarkably good English. &apos;When I was younger I didn&apos;t like sport very much, so I became fat.&apos; His parents had no such obesity concerns or opportunities. &apos;When they were young, they didn&apos;t have the money or the time to play sport other than sometimes swimming in the river. That was free.&apos; He sees the Olympics as a chance for China to show its true face to the world. &apos;I think we will be the brightest star in the Games,&apos; he says. But in basketball at least, he cannot see anyone but the US winning gold. Later in the day, we go to the financial peak of the local sporting hierarchy: the Taiyuan Chenjing golf club. At the driving range, every tee is filled with middle-aged people lofting balls towards a red flag dwarfed by the nearby electricity pylon. Ren Song, a businessman from Shenzhen in the south of the country, started playing three years ago but says he now goes to the driving range every day and plays a full round at least twice a week. &apos;It has become a habit,&apos; he said. &apos;It&apos;s natural for people to want to rise in status. As we get richer and richer, these middle-class sports are becoming more popular.&apos; Back in Beijing, it was clear that there is a two-tier public and private system of sport, just as there is a split between communist political rule and free-market economic policy. Private sports clubs may be the future, but for the moment the state is very much in control of sport. The Bird&apos;s Nest, Water Cube, and other spectacular Olympic stadiums are built with government money.  Almost all the athletes on the Chinese Olympic team will come from the school sports system. Dozens of medals will be won by athletes who were recruited as children into sports they knew nothing about. Will it be worth it? If China wins the most gold medals, its rulers will say yes. But relative to the country&apos;s population, even a haul of 40 golds would be miserable. A study by the Australian Bureau of Statistics said China was 53rd in terms of medals won per capita in Athens. There was one medal for every 20.8 million people. Britain, which was a poor 29th, won medals at 10 times this ratio. And by domestic estimates, each Chinese gold medal in 2004 cost 700m yuan (\u00a351m). Mao Zhixiong, professor of sports psychology at Beijing Sports University, said that, regardless of the medal table, it was time for a change. &apos;I have seen government information that says China is gradually going to learn more from Britain and America, and get closer to how they see the relationship between social power and sport. Even if we get the most gold medals, I think we will still want to reform.&apos; China&apos;s track record \u00b7 Before 1949, China had competed in three Games but won no medals.  \u00b7 Confusion and disagreement about the representation of China and Taiwan within the IOC resulted in the All-China Sports Federation announcing its withdrawal from the IOC in 1958. China resumed its membership in 1979. \u00b7 It was not until the 1984 Games in Los Angeles that China was a major presence, with 224 athletes. Xu Haifeng won China&apos;s first gold medal in the men&apos;s sporting pistol. The country&apos;s total count was 15 golds, eight silvers and nine bronzes, placing its team fourth in the medal table. \u00b7 In 1988 in Seoul, China&apos;s 299 athletes finished 11th in the medal table with five golds, 10 silvers, 12 bronzes.  \u00b7 In Barcelona in 1992, swimmer Lin Li become China&apos;s first world record breaker, winning the women&apos;s 200m individual medley.  \u00b7 In Athens in 2004 China&apos;s tally of 36 golds, 39 silvers and 27 bronzes took them to second place in the medal table.

Once a staple in homes and restaurants, sake is being squeezed out of the affections of the average drinker by imported wine and shochu, a fiery local spirit that is undergoing a renaissance in the trendy bars of Tokyo. Now that sake&apos;s central place in Japanese social occasions is under threat, the country&apos;s struggling breweries are pinning their hopes on growing interest on the other side of the Pacific. According to finance ministry figures, sake exports rose to a record high of 11,334 kilolitres last year, up from 7,051 kilolitres in 2001. About a third goes to the US, followed by Taiwan, Hong Kong and, more recently, China, where shipments doubled to 426 kilolitres between 2002 and 2006. While sake is enjoying unprecedented popularity overseas, at home it is in terminal decline. Since peaking at 1.7m kilolitres in 1975, sake consumption in Japan has fallen every year since 1995 to a record low of 700,000 kilolitres in 2006. The Japanese drink just a third as much sake as they did 30 years ago, when it accounted for a quarter of all sales of alcoholic drinks. Today the figure is closer to 7%. Sake&apos;s stateside renaissance is being driven by a handful of family-run breweries quick to realise the dangers posed by their compatriots&apos; waning appetite for their national drink. &quot;People ask if we alter the flavour of our sake to suit the American palate. We do not. We are just selling them sake that we believe is the best around,&quot; says Yasutaka Daimon, the sixth-generation head of Daimon, a sake brewery in rural Osaka prefecture. Matter of survival Daimon, whose family has been brewing sake - a rice-based fermented beverage - since 1826, was among 20 breweries that co-founded esake.com, a group to promote their products overseas. The results have been dramatic. After sending their first batch of sake to the US in 2003 the breweries recently sold their 91st container, each holding 1,250, six-bottle cases. Their premium sake is now available in 45 states. For small-time brewers like Daimon, cracking the US and Asian markets is not simply about higher profits margins; it is a matter of survival. He now exports a third of the sake produced at his brewery, where brewing methods have changed little for almost two centuries, and recently sold his first case of a high-end sake in the emerging luxury-goods market of Russia. Sake has even won over the world&apos;s most notorious wine snobs: the French. Jean-Paul H\u00e9vin, the renowned Paris chocolatier, regards Kawasemi no Tabi, a sweet sake brewed in Niigata, as the perfect accompaniment to his confectionery. But consumption in Europe still lags far behind that in the US. &quot;Whereas Europe is traditionally wine country, the US is not traditionally anything,&quot; says John Gauntner, a sake expert and author of five books on the subject. &quot;Americans like their wine, but it&apos;s less established, so the country is more open to new trends. Europeans taste sake and say &apos;yes, it&apos;s good and clearly a quality product&apos;, but the next drink they have is wine. &quot;But this too is slowly changing. There is more potential [in the UK and Europe], as Europeans surely have a more refined palate than North Americans.&quot; While sake&apos;s spread has benefited from the global popularity of Japanese food, its decline at home has been quickened by a shift from the traditional diet of fish and rice to one that includes more meat and dairy products. The industry was also hit by the tax agency&apos;s decision, 20 years ago, to stop issuing new brewing licences when existing master brewers retired and were unable to find successors. In the 1980s there were an estimated 3,500 breweries; now there are 1,350. Style-conscious drinkers  For brewers like Daimon, the best hope of a revival in the domestic market may rest on triggering a knock-on effect among ambivalent Japanese who decide to give sake another chance once they see how well it is going down among the style-conscious drinkers of London, New York and, increasingly, Moscow and Beijing. &quot;Young people who come here to drink my sake say they didn&apos;t realise it could be so good - they thought it was an old man&apos;s drink,&quot; said Daimon. &quot;The Japanese are very concerned about what foreigners think of their country, so if we have more success in the US market, then Japanese consumers may give it another try.&quot; But insiders believe the industry can no longer depend on the legions of Japanese office workers who habitually punctuate their daily commute home with a visit to the pub. &quot;Sake is finally coming into its own as a connoisseur beverage [overseas], so I do not think the novelty will wear off,&quot; Gauntner said. &quot;Its roots and true quality are too deep.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/04/golf", "publicationDate": "2008-08-03T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "sentences": ["The 20-year-old, who has won 21 times in the last two years but never outside Asia, finished with an 18-under-par total of 270 and won the \u00a3160,000 first prize by three shots from Taiwan&apos;s Yani Tseng, who also shot 66."], "title": "Golf: Shin shines to win Open with flawless final round while retiring Sorenstam goes out on a high", "article": "Ji-Yai Shin won the Women&apos;s British Open by three strokes after a final-round six-under 66 yesterday to maintain Asia&apos;s domination of the majors.

Shin then birdied the long 10th and both the 13th and 14th, the former with a 35-foot putt that curled in from the left before dropping in to move her three shots clear of her rivals.  She found a greenside bunker on the last but, with her three-shot lead intact, there was little chance of her throwing away the lead. Instead she pitched out to four feet and comfortably made par. Tseng, winner of her first major at the LPGA Championship in June, birdied the last for a 66 to finish on 15 under and South Korea&apos;s Eun-Hee Ji and Fudoh were tied for third on 14 under.

Six under was reasonable, just not good enough.&quot; Stupples finished level with Annika Sorenstam, who was playing in her final major and ended in style with a 12-foot birdie putt for a final round of 68. Sweden&apos;s former world No1 is leaving tournament golf at the end of the year to get married, start a family and focus on her business and other golf interests.  &quot;To finish with a birdie was a little bit extra,&quot; said Sorenstam, who has won 10 majors, including the 2003 Women&apos;s British Open. &quot;I kept it together pretty well today but I was emotional on the first tee and coming up the final few holes. I was pleased to play well and score in the 60s. I just wish the birdie putt at the last had been for the championship.&quot; As she walked up the final fairway, she was caught in a torrential downpour. &quot;But I didn&apos;t care about the rain,&quot; she continued. &quot;I saw a sign on the scoreboard saying &apos;Annika you&apos;ll be missed&apos; and then I was greeted with all the applause. It&apos;s been 15 great years of golf and I just really enjoyed the moment. It was also nice to share it with my caddie [Terry McNamara].

Initially, I didn&apos;t even tell old friends and family my blog address (isaacmao.com). The reason was that I was afraid to come across as sticking my neck out to be very different from the mainstream: traditionally in Chinese culture, it&apos;s better to keep new ventures low-key to avoid losing face if they fail. That first post, on August 5 2002, was little more than a simple announcement saying &quot;From today, I&apos;m stepping into the blogosphere&quot;. What then happened was impossible to imagine: just like in a fairy story, you planted some seeds and woke up one morning to find they had grown into a forest. In the case of my initial blogging, I think of it as huozhong, a &quot;seed fire&quot;, which soon attracted other new bloggers. Zheng, a vocational school teacher in a remote city in Fujian province, found my blog while looking around on Google and sent a comment saying he too was interested in this new format where people could set up personal web logs and write about anything that interested them.  Bloggers&apos; handbook Chatting online, we became friends, and discovered we were both interested in compiling an online handbook to introduce blogging to more Chinese people. That simple idea got us working together to create a group blog site for the purpose - which is how cnblog.org was born.  We subtitled the site &quot;Blog on Blog&quot; and we blogged every day to show people in China how easy it was to create their own blog and use it for writing or exchanging information about almost anything: starting a new career, pregnancy and childbearing, preparing a thesis, and so forth. Things went faster than we imagined. The group blog site collected more than 50 guest bloggers from all over the country to talk about the changes that could be brought about by forms of personal publishing in our particular society.  Observing developments in China&apos;s blogosphere and talking about blogging became an important part of my blog content. By the end of 2002, there were more than a thousand bloggers in China, and at cnblog.org we knew almost every one of them.  Word of mouth By the end of 2007, there were 47 million bloggers in China, the whole blogosphere having expanded itself exponentially by what you could call online word of mouth. Now China may well be, in absolute numbers, the largest blogging country in the world (while having the second largest population of internet users, at 160 million, according to the quasi-official China Internet Network Information Center, after the United States at 190 million). From that you can picture what an explosion of Chinese bloggers there was during 2003-2007. Whether I was, as people have sometimes said, mainland China&apos;s &quot;first blogger&quot;, is hard to track - though I can&apos;t find any other bloggers in Google on that August day when I published my first blog post. What I know is that I feel very lucky to have been the one witnessing the whole process from the very beginning.     Isaac Mao: pictured at the Guardian's Future of Journalism conference. Photograph: David Levene    During our early debates on the functions of blogging for Chinese society, there were many flame wars online. One IT commentator nicknamed &quot;Keso&quot;, for instance, published an article in a popular internet community satirising the passion of pioneer bloggers and predicting that the phenomenon would be short-lived, &quot;just like a fashion show&quot;.  Bloggers responded in defence of their format. Interestingly, after a year of contestation, Keso became a blogger too, realising he could publish his ideas better through a blog than via chatrooms or bulletin board systems (BBS). He is now one of the most famous IT bloggers in China. These days, the sheer number of people blogging in China is having an impact in itself. First, many traditional media in China now quote frequently from blogs. Some of them also discover news sources in the blogosphere - otherwise, they risk losing valuable first-hand information. Second, blogs are always linking to each other and weaving a trust-based social media fabric. And as people increasingly use search engines to get important information, these engine-friendly social media are easily discovered by users. The new individual At the same time, this shift of media power has transformed many bloggers into a new generation of celebrity in the past six years. China has a long tradition of people trying to fit into the group, moderating their behaviour to avoid standing out conspicuously - a culture reinforced by the man-made collectivism of the past half-century.  Blogs have leapfrogged this tradition, acting as a catalyst to encourage young people to become more individual. So this and other grassroots media are now emerging strongly to challenge China&apos;s social legacy. Even so, it&apos;s not entirely easy to blog freely, especially in a country with media controls like China. In 2005, my blog was blocked because I posted an article relating to the Chinese censorship system - probably the most complicated in the world.  This &quot;Great Firewall&quot; or &quot;Kung Fu Net&quot;, as China&apos;s internet users call it can effectively block any web pages including keywords considered sensitive by the authorities (such as &quot;Tian&apos;an Men&quot;, &quot;Censorship&quot;, etc).  If you try to access such a page, the system will return a &quot;reset&quot; message and temporarily render the whole site unaccessible. There are also whole sites that are permanently blacklisted, including those of certain human rights groups or dissident blogs. As social problems have emerged in the past six years, the blacklist has become longer and longer. In my blocked blog, I was analysing the technical details of the system. When the system automatically detected this content, my blog was unplugged the next day. I had to suspend blogging for about 80 days, until I moved my site to a host service abroad.      Isaac Mao's blog    But I came to see that this intervention had a lucky side: because it hurt my social capital online, it forced me to rethink some of my everyday assumptions. I became a stronger confronter to any kinds of censorship from then on. Aware nowadays of Great Firewall - which quite matches its physical namesake, a legacy of the First Emperor - there are many Chinese bloggers who now have their blogs hosted overseas to prevent harassment by local authorities.  So, albeit in a roundabout way, freedom of speech is being realised in this &quot;guesting&quot; way. We hope we can return to host sites in China some day, after our domestic internet businesses reject the compromises of self-censorship. Letter to Google Some months ago I wrote an open letter on my blog to the founders of Google, arguing that Google is now losing its fame among the formerly loyal user community in China because it is making compromises with censorship by filtering content considered sensitive or immoral from search results - even going so far as to remove some people&apos;s names from its index database.  People posted hot comments in response to my letter - some taking issue but most in support. However, there has yet to be a response from Google (or Google China). It did no more than display, six months after the open letter, a message acknowledging that it filtered some results.  Such an abuse of technology has angered a number of Chinese bloggers, who see it as a dilution a dilution of the search engine&apos;s &quot;Don&apos;t be evil&quot; motto. This in turn is almost certainly one of the factors behind Google&apos;s loss of market share in China, where its use rate accounts for less than 25%, a slide of several percentage points since 2005.  A Chinese blogger called &quot;Zola&quot; recently posted interesting home-made video clips on YouTube recording his verbal ambush of Google China&apos;s president, Lee Kai-Fu, at a local hotel where the executive was participating in a forum on the internet in China. Questioned persistently by Zola on Google&apos;s self-censorship policy, Lee cut short his remarks and exited hastily, protected by bodyguards. Unfortunately, I&apos;ve heard from my international blogger friends that such things are happening everywhere. Episodes like this have made me realise why universal values can&apos;t be applied anywhere in the short term (and why a great company can find it hard to become greater). Looking at the experience in my homeland, I also believe the abuses of censorship produce a certain level of social fear - which leads to less creativity. Online fame     Isaac Mao. Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian    Just like everywhere, too, I&apos;ve seen blogs changing people&apos;s personal lives in many ways in China. An obvious one is the impact that a blog&apos;s fame can have on its originator. Zheng, my first blogger friend who was a teacher in a remote city, now is working as chief operating officer of a social networking website.  Serving as chief technology officer in the same business is Bruce Wang, another blogger friend. Various other friends friends have easily found new jobs through their blogging - or even become happy couples. In other words, blogging has brought a higher quality of life to people I know. I sometimes use it to try to solve life problems, or help other friends to solve their problems. So what I&apos;ve witnessed in these six years is not only the explosion in big numbers of users and media space, but also these individual effects - including in my life. I&apos;m now more like a global citizen than six years ago.  International bloggers from different countries became my friends by interacting over blogosphere. It is about trust because when bloggers share their minds they are also sharing the richness of their personal history \u2013 not only past and present, but their expectations too. With such trust and understanding, borders won&apos;t be geographical any more. Rebecca MacKinnon, who was CNN&apos;s Beijing bureau chief and loved Chinese culture, transformed herself into an independent blogger. We became best friends and share information regularly. We also collaborate on some interesting projects such as Global Voices Online, which she co-founded. Another famous blogger I met in the blogosphere is Joichi Ito, a Japanese-American. We both come from a technical background, and we both belong to the army of people whose blogging has led them into becoming entrepreneurs, working with venture-capital investors looking to back internet start-ups.  We exchanged ideas about fostering conversations between young Chinese and Japanese bloggers to reach more understandings over the historical dispute between the two countries. And Carol Lin, who is called &quot;queen of micro-blogging&quot; in Taiwan, helps me understand how people with different political backgrounds can understand each other. The blog is such a good conversation tool that I believe it can help enrich people&apos;s perception of the world - a medium without the constraints of space and mindset that limit traditional media without being misled by poor few. Tolerance through blogging Blogging can also help people to become modest and tolerant - at first, I was easily annoyed by readers&apos; remarks when I thought I was right, but over time I&apos;ve learned a lot from their comments, which has made me more moderate in reacting to them.  An entrepreneur posted some very nasty comments on my blog when I wrote something pointing out design problems with his product. He was very young at that time. Instead of firing back, I just posted further explanations.  Hundreds of reader comments supported my post, and eventually, realising he&apos;d been stupid and almost lost a great opportunity to improve his product, the guy apologised to me. He is now running a quite big business in China. I would also say this process has made me more rational, and more inclined to think in depth. It seems to me that the language and qualities of blogging are a kind of &quot;Modern Chinese&quot;.  In the early internet phase, there appeared a lot of bulletin boards and online forums susceptible to being inundated with nationalist diatribes and online &quot;Dazibao&quot; [wall posters] by some people lacking independence of thought. Today, I think many Chinese bloggers are transferring themselves into Modern Chinese by continuous inputting and outputting their thoughts online. When I started the blogging journey, I was motivated by a vague belief that it could improve my learning skills. I still think that is true, but perhaps the most charming part of blogging is the power of extending your borders in ways that you didn&apos;t plan or intend. Sometimes it&apos;s even magical. Blogging about different parts of your life, you can come to know people you never expected to encounter. All the while, reading and writing blog posts expands your knowledge base.  Occasionally, artists found me via my blog because they loved some of the scripts I wrote about daily life. Some policemen found me and asked to meet me because they disliked points I was making opposing &quot;censorship&quot;. And more, I&apos;ve got to know many entrepreneurs and professionals online through sharing ideas. The privacy issue A lot of people are reluctant to become a blogger just because of their concerns about so-called &quot;privacy&quot;, their worry that &quot;leaking&quot; their personal life to the general public will lead to them being annoyed by other people. I had the same concern for a long time. In the early days, I would think of what consequences every blog post might generate before I clicked the &quot;publish&quot; button. But now this concern has faded away. Anyone, I&apos;ve realised, can well control his/her privacy on a blog. The content I share online using my real identity is actually neither private stuff nor public. It is a new space called &quot;social space&quot;. Of course, the blog can be viewed publicly - but in practice the viewers are those who are interested in my blog and trust me the same way I trust the society. It&apos;s a different mindset that one can feel after blogging for a period of time. I call this philosophy &quot;Sharism&quot;, and it can be practised by anyone because the rewards are easy to see. You share one piece of knowledge and then could come a time of returns (maybe not immediately, but with many magic happenings in the future).  The sharism spirit can currently be found in any so called &quot;Web 2.0&quot; phenomena - Wikipedia is just one example, created from the collective intelligence by many people around the world based on their sharing philosophy.  In a more metaphysical view, your blog can act as a halo (to borrow a term from gaming) to shine more lights to the world and coupled with other people&apos;s halo at the same time. This has spawned more imaginations in my mind of future society where everyone can be sharist and all the brains are well connected to form a smarter society like a social brain - though given the controls and obstacles that still confront blogging, it is going to be a long road to reach the social-brain dream. Meanwhile, I&apos;ve seen my own blogging evolve in several ways. In my first two years, I was spending more than three hours a day to develop from beginner into a skilled blogger, and seemed totally addicted to blogging. Nowadays, I have redefined my daily timetable to mix more offline life with blogging habits. So I&apos;m not a slave of blogging. I think I enjoy a new lifestyle of being &quot;both high tech and high touch&quot;. You could call it life 2.0.  Along the road I&apos;ve also set up a range of separate blogs, reflecting different purposes or targeting different audiences. On them, since that first post, I&apos;ve published 2,300 articles. My next step, however, may be to try to merge them again into one life-log. I&apos;m also managing to post on some group blogs to collaborate on interesting topics.  And I&apos;m regularly blogging in non-text formats - pictures, audio/video clips and more fun stuff. Just in this passing year, I got totally addicted to a new type of blogging -Microblogging, which enables me to blog any time with a short piece of ideas or meme (a concept to describe micro ideas). I find it an easier way to share small pieces of ideas with trusted friends and make life-log possible. One of the fancy things about blog is &apos;permanent&apos; link which is for other people to link back to your post. So I even posted a totally blank post occupying a link.  I carry on trying to persuade all sorts of people to start blogging, without insisting they should follow any particular code - everybody has the right to share whatever they want, though I think they should understand how to keep a balance that avoids infringing others. It&apos;s a process of finding the &quot;larger you&quot; step by step. Today, as a blogger with six years&apos; experience, there&apos;s no question of downplaying what I do. I can confidently print my blog address on my name card and tell other people I&apos;m first a blogger, then a businessman. These changes are not just due to the passage of time, but also to the attitude of millions of bloggers in China towards &quot;the new&quot; - new ideas, new subjects, and the whole outside world.  I&apos;m more likely to share new stuff than six years ago, because I think there are more benefits than risks in sharing. There have been growing pains, but I wish and believe that - for us in China and people everywhere - the blog will eventually become a lifelong partner. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857.

Special parks have been designated where any protesters can be carefully herded and corralled by large numbers of police and security forces during the games. Even the ever-present pollution has been tackled by removing over 1 million vehicles from Beijing&apos;s streets every day and closing down thousands of factories in the suburbs. An eerie calm has settled over the city in excited anticipation of the opening of the games. Not even the barking of dogs is allowed to disturb this strangely tranquil scene. Large dogs have been banned in Beijing and armies of dog-catchers patrol the streets &quot;arresting&quot; pet dogs that are any bigger than a Chihuahua or a terrier, often wrestling them from their owners and taking them to a huge warehouse on the city outskirts, where row after row of cramped cages house the forlorn beasts. China&apos;s attitude to animals is ambiguous to say the least. While there is a growing middle class that likes to own cats and dogs as pets, there are still tens of millions who regard them as only of value for food or fur. Alarmingly, the growing affluence of the Chinese has led to an increased demand for cat and dog meat and fur. Dogs and cats are on sale daily in meat markets across China. They are beaten to death, boiled alive, stabbed and strangled on the spot, or cruelly bound with wire and stuffed into sacks to be slaughtered at restaurants. There is also a burgeoning fur trade, with an estimated two million cats and dogs horrifically killed every year to supply Europe with parka-hood trims, ski boot and glove linings, fur coats and rugs and even toy animals for the tourist trade. After nine years of campaigning with Humane Society International, I successfully steered legislation through the European parliament which will ban the import, export and trade in cat and dog fur in all 27 EU member states from January 1 next year. This news did not go down well in China. When I met with animal welfare minister Li Yucai and his team at his offices in Beijing last year he said that he could not guarantee that China would stop the trade in cat and dog fur. Amazingly he then went on to deny that all two million cats and dogs that I had mentioned would be skinned alive. &quot;There is no economic advantage in skinning animals alive&quot; he said.  The minister tried to justify his position by saying:  The Chinese government has worked hard to improve conditions and welfare for animals. Existing laws allow the captive breeding of animals. But China is different from elsewhere as we use wildlife products in traditional Chinese medicines. We have moved from using wildlife to captive resources for this purpose. However, skinning animals alive is not a common practice in China.   Clearly we have touched a raw nerve with the Chinese government on this issue and despite the successful implementation of our EU ban there remains much work to be done to convince the Chinese to put a stop to this horrific business once and for all.  As we settle down to watch the opening of the Beijing Olympics we should spare a thought for the many millions of dogs and cats that are bred or rounded up in China, crammed into tiny cages and loaded onto trucks to be transported for days under hellish conditions to live animal markets. Here they are bludgeoned to death, strangled, bled our or often boiled alive. Worse still, their death often comes slowly because of the mistaken belief that torture improves taste. In the west we regard companion animals not only as our best friends, but also as part of the family. Sadly this is not the case in China."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/06/olympics20085", "publicationDate": "2008-08-06T09:10:35Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Sport"], "sentences": ["He promised that potentially contentious issues like the role of Chairman Mao in the country&apos;s history, Taiwan and Tibet would be avoided - and that culture, not nationalism, would be the dominant theme of the ceremony."], "title": "Olympics: Foster to carry British flag at opening ceremony", "article": "The Great Britain team have voted for swimmer Mark Foster to carry the British flag at Friday&apos;s opening ceremony. Foster, who is competing at his fifth Games, was chosen by the 313 sportsmen and women who make up the GB team. The 38-year-old Foster, competing in the 50m freestyle, is the first swimmer to carry the British flag since Anita Lonsbrough in 1960. Foster will hope her performance that year will be a lucky omen - she won a gold medal in Rome, as did Sir Steve Redgrave in Atlanta in 1996 and Matthew Pinsent in Sydney in 2000, the years they carried the flag. &quot;I was blown away when I was told, it was a big surprise and a huge honour. It&apos;s fantastic,&quot; enthused Foster. &quot;Some of the most wonderful names in British sport have been Olympic flag-bearers. I really wanted to be picked but I didn&apos;t totally believe I would be. My heart was pumping when the announcement was made. Making the Olympic Games this time around was fantastic in itself, but this has really topped it off. It&apos;s phenomenal.&quot; Friday&apos;s &quot;spectacular&quot; opening Olympic ceremony will last nearly five hours, see 29,000 fireworks launched into the Beijing night sky and star British singer Sarah Brightman, organisers confirmed. Brightman, along with Chinese popstar Liu Huan, will sing a specially commissioned &quot;theme song&quot; at the finale of the artistic part of the ceremony, which will feature 15,000 performers, including professional artists, students and 5,000 soldiers. Organisers refused to reveal whether the song will be English, Chinese or bilingual, but said the lyrics and music were written by Chinese artists. They were, however, more open about other aspects of the ceremony, which director Zhang Heping said would &quot;showcase the ancient and long history of the Chinese nation&quot;. He promised that potentially contentious issues like the role of Chairman Mao in the country&apos;s history, Taiwan and Tibet would be avoided - and that culture, not nationalism, would be the dominant theme of the ceremony. &quot;The performance will reflect the cultural aspects of Chinese society and showcase what modern China and its people are all about,&quot; he added, before promising that the &quot;hundreds of millions of people&quot; watching would see &quot;a spectacular performance&quot;. A 75-minute &quot;pre-ceremony&quot; will feature folk and ethnic art before the central part of the ceremony - the artistic performance, lasting an hour - begins. There will then follow a 2\u00bd-hour parade of the athletes, with teams coming into the stadium in order of the Chinese alphabet, before China&apos;s president Hu Jintao declares the Games open. The ceremony will close with the Olympic flame being set alight, but Zhang gave no clue as to the identity of the torchbearer. &quot;For the lighting of the flame, the last torch bearer, this is the most secretive part and will be revealed at the very last moment,&quot; he said, claiming that the person had been chosen for their &quot;sporting achievement&quot; and &quot;social influence&quot;. Zhang said he hoped that no athletes would use the ceremony to make a political protest. &quot;[We] hope and believe the athletes in the Olympic Games know they should not link the Olympic Games with politics,&quot; he said. &quot;It would run against the charter of the Olympics and the spirit of the Olympic movement.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/09/olympics2008.china", "publicationDate": "2008-08-08T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "China", "World news", "UK news", "Sport", "Asia Pacific", "Zhang Yimou"], "sentences": ["Why should the team from Taiwan be required to disguise itself as Chinese Taipei for two weeks while a team from Palestine is rightly welcomed at the games?"], "title": "Editorial: Olympic games  - the torch passes", "article": "Not even an outstandingly prepared and executed Olympic games opening ceremony - and yesterday&apos;s spectacular in Beijing was undoubtedly that - can avoid being both magnificent and unsettling at the same time. The extravagant opening is part of the ritual of the games, as well as part of its make-believe, and even on occasion part of its self-delusion too. Yesterday&apos;s opening passed the necessary tests not just with flying colours but, courtesy of Zhang Yimou&apos;s brilliant choreography, with flying people, flying Olympic rings, a flying globe and, at the flame-lighting climax, a flying Olympic torch-bearer too. Though the opening owed much to Hollywood-style special effects and computer graphics (and perhaps something to Albert Speer), the display was often unmistakably and refreshingly oriental and human too. Confucius has never had a bigger audience than yesterday. A billion or more human beings were reportedly glued to their televisions around the world throughout the whole thing. And, as any producer will confirm, a billion people are never wrong. Anarchic, individualist, contrarian London has a hard act to follow in 2012.  Actually it is not the fearsomely disciplined dancing or the precision kitsch, let alone the fireworks, of the Beijing Olympic opening that should make us all keep our enthusiasm reined in and our critical faculties alert - and not even the industrial strength poppet singing her Chinese national song either. Any modern Olympic games, whether it is held in Beijing or London or anywhere else, involves a trade-off between idealism and vested interests - and only the naive can be confident that the idealists have the upper hand in the present International Olympic Committee. The tensions take many forms: commercialism, exclusive broadcasting rights, bureaucracy, corruption, drugs and cheating. Yet in most Olympics, and this one is certain to be no different, nationalism is the vested interest that grates hardest and most visibly. The ideal of open competition among the young people of the world is held hostage by national political interests. As the teams paraded around the Beijing stadium from 204 countries that included Liechtenstein, Guam and Andorra - all of which are recognised as independent for Olympic purposes - it was hard not to speculate about teams from countries such as Tibet, Scotland, Turkish Cyprus or for that matter South Ossetia. Their presence yesterday might have upset the status quo. On such occasions the appearance of global unity only highlights national divisions. Why should the team from Taiwan be required to disguise itself as Chinese Taipei for two weeks while a team from Palestine is rightly welcomed at the games? We all know the answer, but it is a reminder that the Olympics and politics are umbilically linked. And not just in China, either. This week&apos;s statement that the UK government has officially targeted a haul of 35 medals in Beijing as the dividend for its \u00a3265m investment in elite competitors at these games is a reminder that people in glass houses should not throw too many stones. Britain will watch the Beijing games with special interest because we are the next hosts. It would be healthy if this engagement could be reflected not just in medals or in grassroots sport, but also in a commitment to restoring a better balance of values to the games. If the Olympic ideal means anything, it ought to mean more priority for human rights, environmental sustainability and openness in the way the games are organised, and less priority for national, commercial and bureaucratic interests. A permanent home - or a home in a middle-ranking country in each of the five continents between which the games can be rotated - is an idea worth exploring. With each Olympics it becomes clearer that the games and the IOC should be reviewed in the interests not of governments and corporations but of sport and people.

We&apos;ve cooed at the 35,000 fireworks. We&apos;ve watched Li Ning run along a computer-generated unfolding scroll thing. We&apos;ve admired the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, kind of absorbed the fact that the No8 is lucky in the Chinese calendar and coughed at the pictures of the smog. And now the Zhang Yimou-directed opening ceremony  is over, let the Games begin.  02.15am: This is the place to come for all the live coverage, blogs, comment and instant response to breaking news. You can also find a handy schedule of today&apos;s events (in Chinese time) here. No wonder Barney Ronay is welling up already.  02.35 am. The eventing dressage is already under way and Daisy Dick, she drafted in because of injuries to Zara Phillips and Lucy Wiegersma&apos;s horses, has already trotted her way to a highly respectable 51.70. (For the equestrian relatively ignorant, the lower the score the better.) FACT: Daisy Dick went to school with our very own  Marina Hyde. Later Britain&apos;s dressage star in the eventing team, and an individual medal hopeful in his own right, 39 year-old William Fox-Pitt, who sounds like a character from  Harry Enfield, but won silver in Athens, has a chance to go one better.  At the Beijing Olympics, even the dressage is political. Security officers in Hong Kong removed a university student, Christina Chan, who tried to display the Tibetan flag.  02:45am: Equestrian dressage, women&apos;s shooting, women&apos;s volleyball, basketball and handball are already under way. Indeed, Australia lead Belarus 19-12 at the end of the first quarter in the opening women&apos;s basketball pool game. Coming up, we&apos;ve got bouts of boxing that&apos;ll make the fighting in opening ceremony director Yimou&apos;s Hero look as menacing as Jimmy Carr. And we&apos;ve balletically brilliant basketball, swimming, volleyball, fencing, beach volleyball, handball and football, that&apos;ll make House of Flying Daggers look like the Friday night lovelies falling out on to the Farringdon Road.  02:58am:  You do worry that all this week&apos;s political breast-beating about how Britain was due a massive medal haul will come back to bite us. It certainly left a bad taste, as David Mitchell so astutely pointed out, in the mouth. William Fox-Pitt scored 50.20 which puts him in at the medal unhopeful position, at this early stage, of 11th.  03:05am: Seven golds are on offer today, indeed, we&apos;re not so far away from the first gold medal \u2013 the women&apos;s 10 meter air rifle. China&apos;s Du Li is reigning Olympic champion and the overwhelming favourite \u2013 it would mean so much to the Chinese for her to retain her title. IOC President Jacques Rogge is even due at the shooting range hall to present the medals. The whole nation is wanting and willing it... but at the moment she&apos;s running fourth but it&apos;s too close to call.  Ironically, in Athens, the German favourite, Heiner Gabelmann, buckled under the strain of expectation. will the same happen to Du Li? You simply can&apos;t imagine the pressure.  03:10am: Back to the women&apos;s basketball. Australia are beating Belarus 44-28 at half-time. The Athens silver medalists are on course for an easy victory. Next up in Group A will be Mali against New Zealand, you&apos;d expect New Zealand to win that equally comfortably.  03:18am: We don&apos;t have a medal yet, but we do have the first athlete to be sent home for failing a drugs test, Greek sprinter Anastasios Gousis, a 200m semi-finalist in Athens four years ago. The Greek Olympic team has already lost 13 members, with 11 weightlifters, a boxer and swimmer Yiannis Drymonakos withdrawn after positive tests in the past three months.  03:34am: After the shooting, the second medal up for grabs is in the Women&apos;s 48kg weightlifting final - it&apos;s a mixture of snatch and clean &amp; jerk lifting methods, with the best total used to determine the final rankings and medal winners. The Turkish phenomenon that is Nurcan Taylan has just entered the competition, failing at 84KG. Astonishing considering that in Athens she set a then world record of 97.5KG. Next we have a strong Thai contingent, with the home favourite, Chen Xiexia, still to come.  03:40am: There&apos;s a result in the women&apos;s beach volleyball. Norway have beaten Belgium 2-0. I&apos;m struggling to picture beach volleyball in Norway, and in truth both nations count as minnows next to the likes of Cuba, Brazil and the United States. Though, of course, as ever in Beijing you can&apos;t discount the Chinese.  03:54am: Before the shooting final really warms up, let&apos;s have a bit of a results and comment round up. In the women&apos;s basketball Australia beat Belarus 83-64. Irish fencer Siobhan Claire Byrne lost to Irena Wieckowska in the first round of the Women&apos;s Individual Sabre. Lastly, William Fox-Pitt has blamed his horses nerves, after a last minute judge&apos;s inspection on his stomach, for his underwhelming performance. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed,&quot; said Fox-Pitt. &quot;He (Parkmore Ed) is capable of a lot better. He seemed very aware of where the exit was and it was hard to keep him concentrated.&quot;  04:01am: Gold medal - women&apos;s 10m air rifle: Katerina Emmons (CZE)  There is disappointment for China in the shooting as Du Li has failed in her attempt to retain the women&apos;s 10m air rifle title, instead the competition was dominated by Katerina Emmons of the Czech Republic who equalled a world record score of 400 in the qualification round. Lioubov Galkina of Russia took Silver and Snjezana Pejcic of Croatia took Bronze. Du Li had to settle for fifth. Better news for China in the weightlifting though, as Chen Xiexia, is taking the opposition to the cleaners.  04:12am: More Beijing beginnings, the men&apos;s cycling, featuring Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre of Spain, and runner-up Cadel Evans of Australia, are on their 148.5 mile way. In fact, the whole thing is something of a Tour de China, taking in some of the Great Wall of China, Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven.  04:21am: Women&apos;s handball news. France survived a scare to beat Angola 32-31. I mention this partly because Britain is trying to kick start interest in the sport ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. You can find out more here, just be aware that they want women 5ft 11in or taller and men 6ft 3in or taller. And when I say kick start interest (or whatever the handball equivalent is) I mean they want us to start winning, we&apos;re not at the Beijing Games.  04:30am:  The Olympics is unarguably the biggest sporting spectacle on the planet. For various technological, demographic and political reasons, The Beijing Olympics will probably be the biggest Games ever. Unless you&apos;re Sky Sports news, that is. They&apos;re focusing on cricket at the Oval (but it&apos;s hardly Vic Marks), Arsenal&apos;s pre-season victory over Ajax and\u2026 Nottingham Forest V Reading. Presumably, because they don&apos;t have the rights, The Beijing Olympics have been erased as completely as Trotsky&apos;s name in later editions of John Reed&apos;s Ten Days that Shook the World. Strewth.  04:35am: Later in the morning, we&apos;ll get our first glimpse of several more Brit hopefuls. Rightly-acclaimed poster boy, Ben Ainslie, goes for his third consecutive gold medal in the Heavy Weight Dinghy competition. Also worth following will be Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson, who are the criminally unheralded favourites in the Keelboat (Yngling) class.  04:55am: Back to the weightlifting, where we&apos;re at the clean &amp; jerk stage. The weights have been disappointing so far - the event kicked off atypically early, around 10.30am Chinese time, and to be blunt you can&apos;t just role out of bed and lift one hundred and ten kilos. In the absence of the elephantine weights I was expecting, I&apos;ve allowed myself to be distracted by the unexpected weightlifting beauty of Melanie Noel. However, now Madamoiselle Noel is out, then the quality of competition is more than making up for the lack of World Record breaking activity. Chinese star Chen Xiexia looks in control but the other medal placings are between Korean Im Jyoung-Hwa, the impressive Taiwanese lifter Chen Wei Ling, the Thai Pensiri Laosirikul and rising Turkish talent Sibel \u00d6zkan.  04:59am: More from the beach volleyball. Bad news for Swiss fans, the women&apos;s team lost 0-2 to China, while the men&apos;s team were beaten by the same score by the Netherlands. Hey, maybe Roger Federer will make it all right by routing Russia&apos;s Dmitry Tursunov later in the tennis.  05:09am: Gold medal - women&apos;s 48 kg weightlifting: Chen Xiexia (CHN)  Chen Xiexia has taken the first Chinese gold of the Games, she made it look easy, and was a country mile ahead of the rest of the field. Second was Sibel \u00d6zkan from Turkey and third was Chen Wei Ling from Taiwan. Next China will get to add to what is certain to be a Midas-ly monstrous haul of golds in the Men&apos;s 10m air pistol final.  05:30am: We&apos;ve a grappling chance of a medal in the judo, where Black Country judoka Craig Fallon will be competing in the men&apos;s 60kg competition, which is just bouting off now. On paper Fallon looks a shoo in. Except that while he was crowned world champion in 2005, and then European champion in 2006, he crashed out in the second round in Athens. After his defeat at the hands of Revazi Zintiridis, his coach blamed the ref, &quot;you&apos;re not going to get any favours from the referees&quot; when you&apos;re &quot;in Greece fighting a Greek guy&quot;. We&apos;ll see.  05:41am: To the gymnasium, where the men&apos;s teams are locked in qualifying (team and individual) battle. Italian Enrico Pozzo is currently letting loose on the pole horse, people in the know say it was average, but to my eyes it was extraordinary. The Chinese athletes, of course, have always excelled in this area. Anyone else remember this?  05:50am: In the second women&apos;s basketball match New Zealand are following the winning example of neighbours, everybody needs good neighbours Australia, they&apos;re leading Mali 42-33 at half-time.  06:05am: One of the nicest stories from out of the leftfield of the Athens Olympics was the silver medal of photogenic badminton mixed doubles pair Gail Emms and Nathan Robertson. Well, the singles tournament is already underway. Pick of the games so far was Indonesian Maria Kristen Yulianti staging a late fightback to beat German hopeful Juliane Schenk in a superb three setter. The Chinese top seeds Lin Dan (male) and Xie Xingfang (female) play tomorrow. Athens quarter finalist Tracey Hallem and rising male hopeful and world no.20 Andrew Smith provide the home challenge. In Guardian land, I need to beat Phil Passey to stay in the Premier League on Tuesday.  06:14am: If you&apos;re wondering quite why we haven&apos;t had that glimpse of Ben Ainslie going for his third gold in the sailing yet, or why I haven&apos;t given you more on Yngling favourites Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson, it&apos;s because the sailing events have been delayed. Meantime Team GB rower, Richard Chambers shares his experience of preparing for a big Olympic day on the water.  06:18am: Lawrence Donegan reflects on how Katerina Emmons upset the formbook and overcame a headache, and the will of a billion odd Chinese people, to beat local hero Du Li, to the first gold of the Games.  06:20am: More on the lack of the scheduled sailing competition, it&apos;s apparently nothing more sinister than a lack of wind. It&apos;s just a postponement at Qingdao &quot;one of the most windless places on the planet&quot; and maybe not the first we&apos;ll see.  06:30am: It&apos;s not that much of an exaggeration to say that Craig Fallon had no sooner begun his fight with Monaco&apos;s unfancied Hann Siccardi, than he beat him. Our Black Country boy is comfortably through to the second round. Good job.  06:35am: More results and news for your delectation. In the women&apos;s beach volleyball the Australians beat the Russians 2-1, while New Zealand eventually closed out Mali in the women&apos;s basketball 76-72. Meanwhile, Qingdao is getting gusty and the sailing is starting up.  06:47am: Back to the pommel horse. Huntingdon-based hopefuls Louis Smith and Daniel Keatings have finished their routines - both hope to make the individual final but the exciting 19 year-old Smith made several minor errors while teammate Keatings&apos; spoiled a fine effort by losing his balance as he dismounted. Despite all the huff and puff about it being a learning experience for London in four years time, they&apos;ll be disappointed if they fail to make the final. Fingers crossed. Better news comes from the cycling, where 19 year-old Brit Johnny Bellis is handily placed as they approach the Great Wall of China.  07:04am: Lack of wind or no, Ben Ainslie has made a storming start in the dingy and has cut his way through the fleet with only Croatia&apos;s Ivan Kljakovi\u0107 Ga\u0161pi\u0107 keeping in touch. Less good news in the Yngling, where the British team were trailing in last, and despite picking up, have it all to do in the downwind half of the first race.  07:17am: James DeGale, the only Team GB boxer in action today, is going into the fourth round against Egypt&apos;s Mohamed Hikal in the opening round of the middleweight division. Sad to say, the Hammersmith boy is in bother. Frankie Gavin debacle aside, you gotta trust John Rawling, that things will turn around for the British boxing team.  07:20am: Bored by the news that Katerina Emmons won the first Gold in Beijing? Andy Bull follows the first loser, Australian badminton hopeful Erin Carroll, gone in 30 odd minutes.  07:24am: He lost the first round or so, but boxer James DeGale triumphed 13-4 over Mohamed Hikal of Egypt in the end. Welcome good news.  07:38am: The wind has dropped again in the sailing, and with it Ben Ainslie&apos;s command of the field in this first race. Charismatic Greek, Emilios Papathanassiou, has overhauled both Ben Ainslie and Ivan Kljakovi\u0107 Ga\u0161pi\u0107 to lead by a distance. In fact, a fair few have sailed past our man Ainslie including America, Brazil and Poland. He finished tenth, a dramatic collapse after the wind died.  07:46am: It&apos;s second round misery again for Craig Fallon, he&apos;s lost his second round match against European champion Ludwig Paischer from Austria. And doubling the unhappy Athens deja vu, Fallon didn&apos;t have the rub of the green from the referee either. Bronze is now the best he can do.  07:56am: The cycling is cracking on - with Stefan Schumacher, a two-stage winner in this year&apos;s Tour de France, currently setting the pace. Sadly, there&apos;s not going to be a fairy tale for the teenage Brit Johnny Bellis, who&apos;s fallen away. From young hopeful to grizzled veteran, William Fotheringham pays tribute to seven-time Olympian Jeannie Longo who rides in the women&apos;s race tomorrow.  08:08am: It&apos;s 8am, which means that it&apos;s time for Lutz, Tom Lutz. But before I handover, let me bring you up to date with some of the non-Brit action. In the women&apos;s handball Hungary beat Sweden 30-24. In the women&apos;s beach volleyball their have been wins for China and Italy. And lastly, but not leastly, China are up in their basketball game with Spain. Should be a close game, that. And now talking you through the last five medals of the first day it&apos;s Mr Lutz.  8.15am: Oh, hello. A few zingers coming up later today. We&apos;ve got a shooting medal to be decided in the next few minutes in the 10m air pistol final and the there&apos;ll be more slashing than in a horror movie double bill later as the women&apos;s sabre medals are decided.  8.18am:  Big news at the beach volleyball courts where George Bush has stopped by to ogl\u2026 support the US women&apos;s team as they practise ahead of their campaign.  8.24am  China&apos;s Pang Wei is destroying the competition in the men&apos;s 10m air pistol. He&apos;s going to have to shoot one of the judges, or George Bush on the beach volleyball court if he&apos;s going to stuff it up at this point. He looks disappointed as his first shot goes just wide of the centre, but it&apos;s good enough to secure the gold. Two golds for China then, only 563 more to go.  8.28 am:  Medals from 10m air pistol final: Gold: Pang Wei (China)Silver: Jin Jong-oh (South Korea)Bronze Kim Jong-su (North Korea)  8.38am :You&apos;ll want to know about the men&apos;s road race, won&apos;t you? Kuschyinski from Belarus/NOT BRITAIN and Pidgornyy from Ukraine/NOT BRITAIN are about 90 seconds ahead of the peloton. There&apos;s still an hour and a half to go though, so plenty of time for them to be caught.  8.40am - Sportsman you might have heard of watch: Tour de France winner Carlos Sastre is back in the peloton minding his own business, ready to make his move.  8.47am: Britain&apos;s Alan Campbell wins his single sculls heat and is through to the quarters.  8.54am: Sean Ingle has been wandering around Beijing inhaling huge lungfuls of not-as-polluted-as-it-once-was air and come to the conclusion that it&apos;s the humidity that will harm athletes, not the pollution. The women&apos;s archery team is through to the final and, like Henry Kelly in his heyday, will be going for gold tomorrow.  9.02am: Our man Fallon battles it out for the chance of a bronze. His opponent is Morocco&apos;s Ahamdi. Fallon, by the way, sports a jaunty bandage round a cut over his left eye, which gives him a rather piratical air. All the judo kids will be wearing it come September, trust me. Gah! That cut has turned into a spurting geyser now and the doctor&apos;s on. Fallon is up 11-0 though.  9.03am: And Fallon is through. He ground out the last seconds of the fight and his bronze dreams are still alive.  9.12am:  The NOT BRITISH breakaway pack are being hauled in by the peloton in the men&apos;s road race, their lead is now just over 40 seconds. The Olympic champion Paolo Bettini from NOT BRITAIN has dropped back after a puncture.  9.17am: &quot;Who leads the cycling road race,&quot; asks Gary Naylor. &quot;I&apos;ve always found it amusing watching how the trade team alliances (and potential contracts for next year) count for rather more than the Olympic ideal. But that&apos;s the deal with cycling - a rare sport that started not as an amateur pastime, but as a professional sport.&quot; It&apos;s Ukraine and Belarus out front, which is a kind of alliance, in that they&apos;re a quite close to each other \u2013 and better mates than say, ooh, Georgia and Russia.  9.19am:  Ben Ainslie, who I once put some pretty tough questions about killer whales to, has won his second race in the sailing.  9.28am: Bettini is making a comeback in the cycling and is towards the front of the peloton. The Spaniards are packed together and looking ominous.  9.31am: Craig Fallon is up against Kim in the judo. Two more victories and he&apos;s got the bronze. And the BBC feed disappears as they clash fort he first time. Fantastic.  9.37am: Ah, good work. We&apos;re back on the judo and Fallon&apos;s stopped bleeding too. He&apos;s 100-0 up for a half-ippon, which is kind of like half knocking someone out.  9.43am: Kim should just punch Fallon repeatedly in the eyebrows \u2013 Fallon&apos;s fatal flaw, along with Austrian judokas is his easily cut brows - if he wants to win, but he&apos;s an honourable opponent and Fallon scraps out the win. Two more victories and he&apos;ll have the bronze.  9.46am: The NOT BRITISH leading pair have been enveloped by the NOT BRITISH chasing pack. The Spaniards are still sticking together and a NOT BRITISH Austrian cyclist has decided to go on a solo break.  9.52am: Yep, the Austrian - Pffenberger - is starting to tire and the chasing pack closes in.  9.56am: Bettini has fallen back into the pack with 21km to go. Cadel &quot;Fun&quot; Evans is frowning his way into a promising position, but the Spaniards are working together and that could be crucial.  10.03am: &quot;Back in the days of Grandstand and Sportsnight, the BBC would occasionally further our education by covering minority sports and most welcome it was (except dressage),&quot; says Gary Naylor. &quot;Now, the BBC barely bothers with sport at all outside Wimbledon, The Open and set pieces like The Olympics and The World Cup. Sky and Eurosport do a decent job but people only buy Sky for the football and possibly the cricket. So - my question - is there anyone with terrestrial TV only who recognises any of the competitors or has seen any of these sports since the last Olympics?&quot; You obviously missed the Cash In The Attic Modern Pentathlon Special where they discovered the stuffed body of the horse used to win the 1912 Olympics, hidden in an attic in Ashby-de-la-Zouch.  10.05am: In the cycling, Schleck attempts to get away from the pack, but he&apos;s reeled back in.  10.12am: Our cheap gimmick of the Games, involves you, the reader, pitting your wits against a betting rat. Look, I don&apos;t know, click here to find out more. Rebellin, Sanchez and Schleck of Italy, Spain and the Netherlands respectively lead the road race by 15 seconds and if they work together should, should share the medals.  10.19am: The leading pack&apos;s lead is down to eight seconds. Yikes!  10.21am: Switzerland&apos;s Cancelerra is storming towards the leading group and has caught them, Mick Rogers of Australia follows them.  10.24:  Rebellin, Sanchez, Schleck and Rogers are all together as they come towards the line, but Samuel Sanchez sprints ahead to secure gold for Spain.  10.26amResults from the men&apos;s cycling road race: Gold: Samuel Sanchez (Spain)Silver: Davide Rebellin (Italy)Bronze: Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland)  10.34am: Britain&apos;s Matt Wells and Stephen Rowbotham are through to the semis in the men&apos;s rowing doubles. While the men&apos;s four have just got away in the heats. After 1.3 metres they&apos;re in a miserable fourth place. Pathetic.  10.37am: Brilliant recovery, they&apos;re up into first after 1km.  10.38m:  Britain \u2013 sporting that trusty rowing combination of floppy hair, double-barreled names and good jaws \u2013 still lead after 1,500m ahead of the Italians.  10.40am: Britain ease home in the men&apos;s four in first place. Top hair-flopping, boys.  10.48am:  Holland take the second heat, just ahead of the Kiwis whose hair is just not foppish enough for my liking. Ireland are up in heat three against Australia, who are pretty handy, by all accounts.  10.52am: Horrific news from Beijing where a US tourist \u2013 a relative of one of America&apos;s volleyball coaches \u2013 has been killed by a Chinese man, who then committed suicide.  10.57am: With the inevitability we&apos;ve come to know and love/read from the Aussies, they take heat three of the men&apos;s four, with the Germans and Ireland trailing in second and third.  11.11am: The swimming will start at 11.30am, so I&apos;m off to rummage through the Guardian&apos;s bins for something to eat. Will be back shortly with a mouldy pork pie and the start of Michael Phelps&apos;s world domination.  11.24am: Fallon&apos;s back on against in the judo and has just scored his first point, then follows it up with a wizari (a half-knockout type thing). If he wins this he&apos;s fighting for bronze.  11.25am: Yekutiel of Israel hits back with a wizari of is own, and then follows up with an ippon. Come in, Craig, your Olympics are over.  11.32am:  Now, no one&apos;s sorrier for young Craig than myself, apart from maybe his family, the people of the Black Country, his dog Pelforth, bandage manufacturers, the Britsh Olympic team and Craig himself, but it does mean that we can concentrate ont he swimming without having to flick over/guess when the judo&apos;s goig to come through on the web feed.  11.35am: An email that&apos;s not from Gary Naylor, about Gary Naylor or referring to his Naylorship: &quot;Just as well as the Olympics are taking place in Beijing,&quot; says Karlo Thornbury, assuming I&apos;m in Beijing rather than a bunker in Farringdon. &quot;If you were in Rome, your bin rummaging might land you in the slammer, courtesy of a new mayoral bye-law (See yesterday&apos;s Guardian).&quot; I don&apos;t read the Guardian Karlo, I&apos;m more of a Daily Mail man.  11.39am: Tom Haffield is up in the men&apos;s 400m individual medley. He&apos;s only racing the world champion, so should be a shoo-in.  11.44am Haffield turns for the last leg (freestyle) in seventh and ends up in exactly that position. Don&apos;t expect him to be having a wee cry on the podium as they belt out God Save The Queen any time soon.  11.49am: South Korea&apos;s women&apos;s basketball team have beaten Brazil in an overtime thriller 68-62. While Euan Dale of Britain trails home in sixth in the second heat of the men&apos;s 400m medley. Hey! We&apos;re getting better all the time: fourth place here we come. Michael Phelps is up next.  The Perils Of Opening Up Your One Party State To The Outside World Dept: low-quality trance booms round the water cube as Michael Phelps breezes through his heat. Within about 10 seconds he&apos;s broken the rest of the field. The field catches him up slightly in the breastroke leg, but he eases off as he cruises home in - yep - first.  12.05pm: It&apos;s the butterfly next, a stroke that wastes more energy than a two-bar heater warming an ice palace.  12.13pm: Jemma Lowe and Fran Halsall of Britain are in the final heat of the 100m fly. Under 58 seconds and they&apos;re in with a chance of progressing. Halsall is third at the turn, with Lowe in fourth. They end up fourth (Lowe) and fifth (Halsall), that&apos;s good enough for Lowe to make the semis, Halsall will miss out.  12.16pm: Results for the women&apos;s 48kg judoGold: Alina Alexandra Dumitru (Romania) Silver: Yanet Bermoy (Cuba)Bronze: Ryoko Tani (Japan)  12.27pm: By the way, if you want to read about Britain&apos;s archers&apos; success this morning, click here, for more on Craig Fallon&apos;s woe click here and for William Fotheringham&apos;s analysis of the cycling click here.  12.29pm: In the gymnastics, Britain&apos;s Louis Smith is fourth after two thirds of the pommel horse qualification, and Daniel Keatings is eighth. However, Keating&apos;s almost certain to drop out as the Romanians and Koreans have their crack at qualifying this evening. Better news for Keatings is that he&apos;s sixth in the all-round event, so could cling on for a place in the final there. If either Smith or Keatings reach the final, some grizzly old hack who looks like he knows a thing or two reckons it&apos;ll be the first time a British male has ever done so in Olympic gymnastics.  12.33pm:  Dean Milwain finishes down in seventh in the men&apos;s 400m freestyle. Some people say Britain&apos;s swimmers start fast enough, but I think we&apos;re doing a fine job of going out very quickly indeed.  12.35pm: Results for the men&apos;s 60kg judoGold: Choi Minho (South Korea)Silver: Ludwig Paischer (Austria) Bronze: Rishod Sobirov (Uzbekistan) Ruben Houkes (Netherlands)  12.42pm: David Carry is up against the might of Grant Hackett in the final heat of the 400m freestyle. Hackett&apos;s had a shoulder injury, and starts off well, but is reeled in by Vanderkaay of the US, before a late burst sees him edge out the American into second. Carry puts in a British record as he finishes fifth - it&apos;s not good enough for a place in the final, sadly.  12.54pm: Keri-Anne Payne and Hannah Miley are competing for Britain in the women&apos;s 400m medley.  1.06pm:  Keri-Anne Payne goes in lane six in the third heat. She finishes in fifth and that&apos;s probably the end of her campaign in this event.  1.13pm: Kirsty Coventry, one of the favourties for the 400m medley, finishes in third in her heat behind Steph Rice of Australia and is sixth fastest at the moment. She may not make the final if the last heat is a fast one.  1.17pm: Word-record holder Katie Hoff goes in the final heat against Hannah Miley, the other races have been pretty fast, so Miley will need to get in Hoff&apos;s slipstream if she&apos;s to have a chance.  1.18pm: Miley is in second place at 150m...  1.19pm: ... and at 200m.  1.21pm: Hoff takes control at 300m and is a second in the lead ahead of Miley.  1.22pm:  Miley finishes in Hoff&apos;s wake, but it&apos;s good enough for her to record the eighth fastest time overall. We&apos;ll see her in tomorrow&apos;s final.  1.25pm: Results for the women&apos;s sabreGold: Mariel Zagunis (USA)Silver: Sada Jacobson (USA)Bronze: Becca Ward (USA) Conclusion: don&apos;t get into a sword fight in America.  1.46pm: There&apos;s been some pretty pacy heats in the men&apos;s 100m breaststroke, so Britain&apos;s Chris Cook is going to have his work cut out. And he duly finishes in fourth, should be good enough to get into the semis.  1.49pm: Kris Gilchrist is next up for Britain in the 100m breaststroke. Gilhrist&apos;s more of a 200m specialist, he finishes in seventh and won&apos;t make the semis. Cook, however, will. That was a ridiculously quick set of heats and Cook did very well to qualify 15th fastest.  1.52pm: Last race of our kind-of-five-minute-delay coverage. Britain go in the women&apos;s 4x100m freestyle. Britain finish the first leg in first place.  1.53pm: Britain are second after 250m...  1.55pm: ... but they fade as the Chinese surge into first. Britain end in fourth place - they record a British record too - and will have to wait for the second semi-final to see if they come back again tomorrow."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/10/olympicsandthemedia.olympics2008", "publicationDate": "2008-08-09T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Olympics & the media", "Olympics 2008", "China", "World news", "Sport", "Media", "Press freedom", "Newspapers & magazines", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games", "Zhang Yimou"], "sentences": ["And now the Games begin with broken promises on press freedom and shipping in party members to forcibly replace ordinary Chinese hoping to see the torch relay.&apos;Taipei Times, Taiwan &apos;Not for decades has an Olympic Games been opened in such a colourful and overpowering fashion."], "title": "Beijing Olympics 2008: What the world's media said", "article": "&apos;This great performance was a brilliant distillation of 5,000 years of glorious history.

Optimism that soaring food commodity prices could lift millions of developing country farmers out of poverty and lead to more food being grown have been dashed, says the UN. This is because small farmers either consume their own crop or have no access to global markets to take advantage of the higher food prices.  There is little prospect of relief. A world fertiliser forecast report, due to be published by the UN this week but seen by the Guardian, states that prices will remain high for at least three years and possibly longer. Fertiliser prices have mostly doubled and in some cases risen by 500% in 15 months as US farmers have rushed to plant more biofuel crops and countries such as India and China have bought fertiliser stocks in large quantities to guarantee their food stocks. But while the unprecedented price explosion has barely affected large commercial farmers, it is leading directly to civil unrest among small farmers in developing countries. There have been fertiliser riots or demonstrations in Vietnam, India, Kenya, Nepal, Nigeria, Egypt, Pakistan and Taiwan in the last few months. Last week one man was killed in a stampede at a government handout of fertiliser in Hyderabad, India. Senior UN Food and Agriculture organisation analyst Dr Jan Poulisse warned the poor were being hurt the most by the crisis. &quot;High commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices. But rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers, particularly in Africa,&quot; Poulisse told the Guardian. &quot;People just cannot afford [fertiliser]. They were in dire straits before, but now the situation is worse.&quot; Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa have been hardest hit because they have the least chance to benefit from soaring food prices on the world market, but desperately need fertilisers to replenish nutrient-depleted soils. World fertiliser prices have risen more than oil or any other commodities in the last 18 months. Of the three main types, diammonium phosphate (Dap) sold for US $250 per tonne in January 2007 but has risen to $1,230 per tonne. Potash-based fertilisers have risen from $172 to over $500 a tonne, and nitrogen based fertilisers have risen from $277 to over $450 per tonne. Much of the price rise is attributed to first world farmers who have applied high levels of fertilisers to maximise harvests of grain to take advantage of record grain prices, said Dr Balu Bumb, policy leader at the International centre for Soil Fertility and Agricultural Development (IFDC) in the US. The UN fertiliser forecast blames capacity constraints for the price rises. &quot;Strong global demand for fertilisers is stretching current production capacity to its technical limits. This situation will persist until new capacity comes on line&quot;, it states. &quot;It can take 5-7 years to open a phosphate mine, 10 years for a potash mine and three years for a major nitrogen plant&quot;, said Dr Poulisse, one of the report&apos;s authors. At least 50 new plants to make nitrogen fertiliser are believed to be under construction, and phosphorous and potassium mines are being expanded. Fertiliser prices have in the past been largely controlled by governments because they are so politically sensitive. But keeping prices down in the current crisis is now impacting heavily on other areas, such as education and health.  India is expecting to have to spend $24bn supporting fertiliser prices this year compared to only $4bn three years ago and countries such as Malawi have had to borrow millions to introduce a fertiliser subsidy programme. However, the president of Malawi admitted last week that the subsidy programme was failing the poor. &quot;Sadly, it is the rich who are benefiting a great deal. They are selling maize to the poor at exorbitant prices,&quot; he said. Agriculture and development experts say the world has few alternatives to its growing dependence on fertiliser. As population increases and a rising global middle class demands more food, fertiliser has become the preferred route to higher yields. &quot;Rises in basic commodity prices should be good for small growers but we are seeing that agri-business is reaping all the benefits. It needs a fundamental reform of the way agriculture is managed as well as more sustainable farming&quot;, said Amy Barry, an Oxfam spokeswoman."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/12/olympics2008.china2", "publicationDate": "2008-08-12T17:14:04Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["Taiwanese fans have found an ingenious, if confusing, way to cheer on their athletes: the country competes as Chinese Taipei and uses a special Olympic flag.", "But a Taiwanese newspaper reports that spectators are planning to skirt the ban on their regular flag by waving that of Burma instead: since it also sports a blue star-studded square on the upper left corner of a red backdrop, it is close enough to be mistaken at a distance."], "title": "Beijing Olympics diary", "article": "Taiwanese fans have found an ingenious, if confusing, way to cheer on their athletes: the country competes as Chinese Taipei and uses a special Olympic flag.

According to Caijing magazine, they have been urged to avoid contact if possible and reply to direct questions with the phrase: &quot;I do not know the specific circumstances.&quot; If a picture is requested, they should avoid looking at the lens, lest people wrongly think that they are eager to have their photograph taken. One volunteer summarised their job description: &quot;Prevent drugs, prevent bombs, prevent journalists.&quot; \u0095 The games may have begun, but Olympic construction continues: today Beijing unveiled the Great Wall Express - a sleek new train service halving the time it takes to reach the World Heritage site from the city. At present Badaling, the nearest stretch of the wall, is around two hours away. Zhou Zhengu, vice head of the Beijing Municipal Committee of Communication, said it had taken only four months to overhaul an existing rail link: &quot;We have what we call &apos;Beijing speed&apos;.&quot; \u0095 Three police were stabbed to death at a road checkpoint in the western Chinese province of Xinjiang today in the bloodiest fortnight in more than a decade for the region. In what appears to be an attempt to use the Beijing Olympics to attract attention, Uyghur separatist militants have dramatically escalated the number and intensity of their attacks since the start of last week. Since the Olympics began, 20 people have been killed, 18 have been injured and numerous buildings and cars have been damaged or destroyed in the area. The state-run Xinhua news agency said the attack took place at 9am in the town of Yamanya, in Shule County. It said the number of assailants was unknown and that they were still at large. Yamanya is a mere 20 miles or so from Kashgar, where last week two alleged Muslim jihadists drove a lorry at high speed into a rank of jogging paramilitaries, and killed the survivors with bombs and knives. Sixteen people died in the attack. On Sunday, militants, including a 15-year-old girl, launched a wave of suicide bombings and grenade attacks on police barracks, trading offices and a bank in a shopping centre in the city of Kuqa, killing a security guard. \u0095 With China&apos;s stock market continuing to slide, it&apos;s little wonder thatShanghai traders are looking at other options.

A couple of miles away, bored Georgians soldiers sat keeping warm around a brazier.  When I visited it a few months ago, South Ossetia seemed like the end of the world, not the place that would spark a new war in the Caucasus. It was one of the four so-called &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; of the former Soviet Union and, as it had been for years, still very much in the deep freeze. The mood was not much different in Sokhumi, the capital of Abkhazia, to the west. This city by the Black Sea, much of which remains in ruins from the war of the early 1990s, was once the holiday playground of the Soviet elite. Now old men played chess under gently swaying palms in front of wrecked hotels, and I visited a memorial for the Abkhaz soldiers who had died fighting the Georgians. At the Inguri river, where you crossed from Georgia proper, the Georgians had erected a sculpture of a huge pistol pointing north to Abkhazia - but in a futile gesture the barrel had been tied in a knot. South Ossetia and Abkhazia both broke away from Georgia in savage fighting when the Soviet Union disintegrated. The other two &quot;frozen conflicts&quot; in this region are Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian enclave wrenched from Azerbaijan, and Transnistria, whose Slav population rebelled against Moldova, whose people and language are closely related to Romania. All are the unhappy legacies of Stalinist map-making, lines drawn in a period when the wishes of people counted for little and the demise of the Soviet Union was beyond imagination. All are unrecognised but exist as de facto states, albeit with support from Russia and, in Nagorno-Karabakh&apos;s case, Armenia. Take South Ossetia, which like Abkhazia had autonomous status within Soviet Georgia. Although many South Ossetians live in Tbilisi and elsewhere in Georgia, its people are really connected in terms of family, kin and language with North Ossetia, which is now in Russia, across the mountains to which it is connected through the Roki tunnel. Ossetians speak a language related to Persian and believe (truly) that the King Arthur of British myth was actually an Ossetian. I found billboards in Tskhinvali emblazoned with pictures of men dressed as knights in armour celebrating the 17th anniversary of South Ossetia&apos;s declaration of independence. Its population is tiny - somewhere between 22,000, as the Georgians claim, and 70,000, according to the South Ossetians. The numbers vary not least because, as there is no work (and no university) in South Ossetia, many go to Russia and only come home for the holidays. Even before last week, South Ossetia was hardly a candidate to be a viable state, especially as large swathes of it - as much as a third - were held by the Georgians. Only 800 metres separated the centre of one Georgian-controlled village from Tskhinvali. The Georgians had recently built a brand new cinema and sports complex in that village, and roads and infrastructure were being upgraded.  The head of the Georgian administration for South Ossetia was a burly former military man who had defected from the separatists. He cut little ice in Tskhinvali, where officials scoffed at his notion of striking a deal and making peace with Georgia. Indeed, their plans were rather more ambitious. &quot;Our aim is unification with North Ossetia,&quot; Alan Pliev, the deputy foreign minister of South Ossetia, told me in his broom cupboard of an office. &quot;We don&apos;t know if that would be as part of Russia or as a separate united Ossetian state.&quot; Juri Dzittsojty, deputy speaker of parliament, says: &quot;I would prefer there to be an independent and united Ossetia, but today it is not possible. It is safer to be with Russia. The main aim of the struggle is to be independent of Georgia.&quot; A few hours&apos; drive away, along the road now cut by Russian troops, the Abkhaz dream was a different one. Their goal is simply to hang on to what they have got. And here&apos;s the rub. Before the Abkhaz war of the early 1990s, less than 18% of its population were ethnic Abkhaz. Today, of some 200,000 people, this group still constitutes only 45% of its people, and hundreds of thousands of Georgians who left Abkhazia in the 1990s want to return home. The Abkhaz, who are in firm control of the government and of all levers of power, argue that to allow more of these refugees back than they have already permitted would simply be to turn back the clock and to make the Abkhaz once more a small minority in their own homeland. In the foreign ministry of the unrecognised republic I waited to see Maxim Guinja, Abkhazia&apos;s deputy foreign minister. Then he came out, and before we talked he tidied away some flags in the waiting room. There had just been a meeting in Sokhumi of the leaders of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Transnistria. &quot;We became 18% because of Soviet rule and Russian before that,&quot; he explained. Abkhaz were deported to Siberia and Turkey, and Georgians settled here. &quot;My grandfather was put on a train in 1937 with thousands of others, and the next day a train arrived with Georgian settlers. No one returned from Siberia.&quot; His dream is that one day hundreds of thousands of Abkhaz - or rather their descendants who fled the Tsarist invasion to Turkey in the late 19th century - will come home. A pipe dream? Maybe, but Guinja said that he had a very clear precedent in mind. Israel did it, so why not Abkhazia? In the meantime, the Abkhaz have to play gingerly with the Russians, whom they distrust as much the Ossetians trust them. &quot;For Russia, Abkhazia is just a card that can be played,&quot; I was told by Leyla Taniya, who runs a thinktank in Sokhumi. &quot;Abkhazia is linked to Russia, and Russia is the only country that actually cooperates with Abkhazia, and today many are afraid this could lead to our political absorption.&quot; She wants to correct a &quot;common misunderstanding&quot; in the west: despite its small size, Abkhazia &quot;is not a Russian puppet&quot;. It is easy to comprehend why such a misunderstanding should exist. The Abkhaz, like the South Ossetians, have all been given Russian passports and vote in Russian elections, even though their unrecognised statelets are legally part of Georgia. They use the rouble, their people work and study in Russia and they speak Russian at least as much as Abkhaz or Ossetian. Their elderly receive their pensions from Russia. And, as the last few days have helped demonstrate, without Russian military support, it is doubtful whether the breakaways would still exist. Yesterday, Abkhazia began a military operation to take back a strategic sliver of territory held by the Georgians within Abkhazia. They could do this because Russian troops had struck far outside Abkhaz territory, routing the Georgian forces. No wonder everyone was so relaxed when I was in Sokhumi. I went to see Stanislav Lakoba, the Abkhaz official in charge of security. Georgia, I put it to him, was pouring 10% of its GDP into its army, was bidding to join Nato, had intensely courted the US and was demanding that Russia pull its so-called peacekeeping troops out of Abkhazia, 14 years after their deployment. &quot;Georgia just screams about it,&quot; he said laconically. &quot;It would just mean suicide if they attacked.&quot; He obviously knew what he was talking about. Despite its massive military support for the breakaways, the curious thing is that Russia does not actually want their full secession. It is a case of, &quot;Listen to what I say, not what I do.&quot; After battling separatists in Chechnya and beyond for well over a decade, Moscow is afraid of anything that might set a precedent and encourage the break-up of the Russian Federation. It is not the only big power with such concerns: China is nervous about anything that might boost separatist hopes in Tibet or Xinjiang, let alone Taiwan. This year the argument over breakaways and precedents has reached fever pitch, and the reason for that is Kosovo. On February 17, Kosovo, which has a population of some two million, 90% of whom are ethnic Albanians, declared independence from Serbia. Serbia of course rejects its independence, as does Russia, China and indeed the majority of countries in the world, including Georgia. Twenty out of 27 EU states have recognised it, however, alongside the US and other western countries. But in doing so these 45 states seem to have crossed a legal Rubicon. Until then, the only new states in Europe had been the six republics of the old Yugoslavia, such as Croatia or Bosnia, the 15 former Soviet republics and the Czech and Slovak republics. Kosovo is different. Like the four post-Soviet breakaways, it was a province or part of an existing republic. So, argued Serb leaders, it did not have the same right to independence as the republics did. &quot;Yes, we do,&quot; argued the Kosovo Albanians. Their struggle, they argued, was based on the legal right of a people to self-determination - just like the Serbs argued in 1991 when they briefly set up a breakaway republic of Krajina in Croatia. Quite simply then, in Kosovo as in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two pillars of international law - that is to say, the territorial integrity of states versus self-determination - stand in stark opposition to one another. Hence Russia&apos;s refusal to back Kosovo&apos;s independence. &quot;The threat of a disintegrating Russia - comparable to the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 - is still today seen as a very real threat by the Kremlin and the Russian elite,&quot; says Pavel Felgenhauer, a leading Russian commentator. &quot;The west is seen today by many in the Russian elite and public as a threatening force that is plotting to tear Russia apart and rob it of its natural resources. By supporting Serbia&apos;s right to veto Kosovo&apos;s secession, the Kremlin clearly believes that it is defending Russia&apos;s undisputed right to sustain its territorial integrity by any means available.&quot; Of course, Russia is interested in its territorial integrity, not Georgia&apos;s. By supporting Abkhazia and South Ossetia, it has the means to keep Georgia at its mercy and prevent it from following the pro-western path chosen by its electorate. But beyond that, it has little real interest in the breakaway states. Where the EU has poured billions into the reconstruction of Sarajevo and other Balkan cities ruined by wars of the 1990s, Russia has spent not a kopek in rebuilding Sokhumi or Tskhinvali. In September, Serbia will ask the General Assembly of the United Nations to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to hand down an advisory opinion on whether Kosovo&apos;s declaration of independence was legal or not. If this ever happens, the ruling could have tremendous impact - or not, as the case may be. If Kosovo&apos;s 1.8 million people can declare independence and be recognised without the permission of Serbia, then so can Abkhazia or South Ossetia, to say nothing of the Republika Srpska (the Serb part of Bosnia), Iraqi Kurdistan and - who knows? - one day perhaps even Catalonia or the Basque country.  On the other hand, the ICJ could declare that Kosovo&apos;s declaration was indeed illegal - and then what? Not much, probably. In 1975, the ICJ ruled that the people of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara had the right to self-determination. This was disputed by Morocco, which had occupied the country. Now, 34 years later, Morocco, a good friend of the west, is still occupying Western Sahara, most of the population has been driven out and lives in miserable camps in the Algerian Sahara, and the Moroccans have built a wall around the country to keep separatist guerrillas out. No one outside the region cares a hoot about them because, when it comes to these types of conflicts, hypocrisy is everyone&apos;s order of the day. What it comes down to is simple: being in the right place at the right time and having the right friends with the right guns and interests. Precedent, for all of the diplomats&apos; fear of the word, is only part of it. It is where you are on the map and what you can get away with that counts. In 2002, on a trip to Iraqi Kurdistan, I was struck by the way the Kurds&apos; homeland had been carved up as the Ottoman empire collapsed. Few Kurds I met then made any secret of their desire not just to achieve independence from Iraq but also to act as a vanguard that would eventually rally Kurds from Iran, Syria, and Turkey into one large Kurdish state. I asked one official if the aim of a Kurdish federal unit in Iraq was to provide an example for Kurds in Turkey and so that later they could join together. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;That&apos;s the aim.&quot; Then, embarrassed, he added: &quot;But don&apos;t write that down.&quot; Musa Ali Bakr, the man who was then in charge of refugees in the Kurdish region of Dahuk, explained that if the Iraqi Kurds moved too quickly their neighbours would strangle them by closing the borders. He then summed up what for me then was the Kurdish dilemma, but I now realise is really the dictum of all successful separatists: &quot;If you are sick, you visit the doctor. He prescribes the medicine. You take a spoonful three times a day and eventually you are better, you are free. However, if you drank the whole bottle all at once, it would kill you.&quot; \u00b7 Tim Judah covers the Balkans for the Economist.

The USA&apos;s Carl Lewis and Mark Spitz won lasting worldwide fame doing it; Finland&apos;s Paavo Nurmi and Russia&apos;s Larysa Latynina weren&apos;t quite so acclaimed (we couldn&apos;t U-S-A! U-S-A! possibly guess U-S-A! U-S-A! why) but at least they have a place in the Olympic annals. This morning Michael Phelps won not just his 10th gold, but his 11th too, and did so with truly breathtaking ease. Or at least breathtaking for everyone watching. Phelps himself didn&apos;t seem to even break sweat. At 10.23am local time he eased home in (yet another) world record in the 200m butterfly. And less than an hour later he was leading his team out in the 4x200m freestyle. How many Americans does it take to win a relay? One, apparently. Phelps opened up a two-metre lead on the first length and the gap only grew from there. Oh yes, it was another world record. The only things between Phelps and the indisputable &apos;greatest of all time&apos; tag that would come with breaking the record for most golds at a single games (seven) are the Stars and Stripes speedos of Mark Spitz and the slippery tiles on the walk to the pool. Phelps 5-2 Britain then. Team GB can take the same kind of desperate consolation being drawn on by CNN and other stateside networks covering the ever-worsening hooning they&apos;re being given in the medal table by China - we may be losing in the league, but we&apos;re ahead in the overall medal tally. This morning Emma Pooley took some of the limelight away from team-mate Nicole Cooke by taking silver behind an American cyclist named (Kristin) Armstrong in the women&apos;s road time-trial. No shame in that. And yesterday Britain added a pair of bronzes with the horses in Hong Kong, the overall eventing team taking one and Tina Cook bagging the other in the show jumping. At Shunyi, as far from Hong Kong as the Games get, David Florence won silver with a fine final run in the C1 (solo canoe) slalom. Just three months ago Florence applied to become an astronaut with the European Space Agency, thus forcing headline writers across Britain to either resist or indulge their finest punning instincts, depending on their level of self-restraint.

Taiwan baseball player fails drugs testThe IOC says pitcher Chang Tai-Shan is the latest sportsman to test positive for a banned substance. Diary While David Florence was celebrating his silver medal yesterday, a lot of other eyes were on Benjamin Boukpeti, who won Togo&apos;s first ever Olympic medal with a bronze in the K1 slalom. The world&apos;s hacks were understandably thirsty for the story of this piece of history. The only problem? Boukpeti had lived in France all his life, and only ever visited Togo once. Undeterred the hacks asked Boukpeti what he thought of his time in Togo. He said he&apos;d been too young to recall. Asked again, and again, Boukpeti finally fed them this gem: &quot;I remember my brother had a red ball which he refused to leave behind for my cousins to play with, he threw a huge tantrum. Other than that my mother tells me I mistook every black man there for my father.&quot; On similar lines, there were plenty of journalists at this morning&apos;s Georgia v Russia beach volleyball game. You might expect the Georgian duo were extra pleased with their victory because they were playing the country they have been fighting over the last few days. Only, the Georgian duo were actually from Brazil. Li Ning has had a pretty good week. Not only did the former gymnast get to fly around the Bird&apos;s Nest on Friday night before lighting the Olympic flame, a spike in the share prices of his company, Li Ning, has earned him around \u00a315m. There&apos;s trouble brewing in the baseball competition which started today.

China&apos;s self-presentation is a continuous act of fraud, which matters because the victims of the fraud include the Chinese people themselves and the future.  So well-known is this that I cannot imagine anyone is surprised to learn that Lin Miaoke was miming to the sweet tones of the even younger Yang Peiyi, deemed insufficiently pretty to take the stage. For this is just par for the Zhong Nan Hai course. Other elements of that deceptive moment at the opening ceremony might not have registered with the watching billions. The Chinese flag was carried to the squadron of goose-stepping soldiers by a large cohort of children, all dressed in the traditional costumes of the so-called &quot;minority peoples&quot; of the Chinese empire \u2013 the Zhuang, the Manchu, the Hui, the Miao, the Uighur, the Yi, the Tuja, the Mongols, the Tibetans, the Buyei, the Mosuo, the Naxi, and so on \u2013 there are 55 such groups recognised officially by the Chinese government, and a number more who claim ethnic difference from the Han Chinese but are not recognised. Almost all these people live in territories occupied by the Chinese empire. For that is what China is: it is as Europe would be if Napoleon or Hitler had won their respective wars of conquest and unified Europe under a single rule. Then imagine that the conquering nation had grown in population to be 90% of the continent&apos;s ethnicity, leaving the Czechs and Scots and Hungarians to be &quot;minority peoples&quot; obliged to attend national ceremonies in their quaint ethnic dress. Just to give a sense of what is involved here, let me relate an anecdote. While teaching at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing some years back, I was asked by the members of another department of the academy&apos;s Institute of Philosophy to give a lecture on &quot;the nature and origins of consciousness&quot;. Rather bemusedly I said that I&apos;d be happy to talk about the difficulties we face in understanding the nature of consciousness, but was not sure what could be said about its origins. And I asked them whether the origins of consciousness was a subject of research among them. Oh yes, they said; we take our clip-boards and visit minority peoples in the outlying areas of China, and we study them, because they have more primitive levels of consciousness than Han Chinese, so from them we can infer something about the evolution of consciousness among humans. Enough said. At the oasis of Turfan in the Taklamakan desert I once asked a Uighur for his view of Chinese rule over his region. After a significant pause he said, gesturing at the well next to which we stood: &quot;A Chinese will take the bucket from the well and put it down on the sand.&quot; Nothing could be worse for a desert-dweller than to have dirt introduced to well-water; the comment was intended as a sweeping metaphor. In fact neither of these tales is fair to the Chinese people themselves, but both speak volumes about official or governmental China. Here is a generalisation, to be tempered by remembering that people are much the same everywhere: the Chinese seem to me a good-hearted, hard-working, courageous, sentimental, humorous, vigorous, highly likeable people, and I have the deepest affection for many friends made in years of living and travelling there. Bureaucratic China, government China, is an utterly different matter.  Because China is going to be a world superpower in a generation&apos;s time, it matters that China should rectify its horrible human rights record, give up its irredentism, think again about its forcible occupation of Tibet, Xinjiang, and the &quot;minority areas&quot; along the Vietnamese and Burmese borders, stop supporting hideous regimes like Sudan, Burma and Zimbabwe, and become a good neighbour to Japan and Taiwan, and a good world citizen generally.  Only think: on most of the items just listed, the world&apos;s current sole superpower has never been wholly scrubbed-pink-perfect, and yet if you put a gun to most people&apos;s heads and forced them to choose between living in the US or almost anywhere outside the developed world, they would choose the US. If China becomes as the US is today in world-power terms \u2013 which it will: get the Mandarin textbooks out folks \u2013 yet keeps its current regime and outlook, US history will look like a legend of saints. That is why the pressure has to be kept up on China to reform its political institutions and human rights record \u2013 systematically one of the worst in the world: experto crede, I had years&apos; worth of attendance at the UN Commission and Sub-Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, lobbying on China matters, and know the litany of charges by heart \u2013 because we or our children are going to be very influenced by decisions made in Beijing. What we do not want is an apparently sweet-faced Chinese government singing saccharine melodies while behind the scenes what is afoot is fraud."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/15/olympics2008.britisholympicteam", "publicationDate": "2008-08-15T00:33:07Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "British Olympic team 2008", "Olympics 2008: Gymnastics", "Olympics 2008: Aquatics", "Olympics 2008: Athletics", "Sport", "Olympics 2008: Cycling", "Olympics 2008: Sailing", "Usain Bolt", "Kelly Sotherton", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["5.01am: In the men&apos;s table tennis, Austria account for Croatia 3-1 and Hong Kong topple Taiwan 3-0 in the bronze medal play-offs.", "A 3-0 sweep of the-island-otherwise-known-as-Taiwan in the bronze medal match, sealed by Athens-silver-medal-winning legends Li Ching and Ko Lai-Chak in the doubles.&quot; That&apos;s that covered."], "title": "Olympics: day seven - as it happened", "article": " Russell will be here from 1.55am...  1.59am: Morning all, and welcome to day seven.

Ironic that surname, no?  2.54am: Asafa Powell - don&apos;t call him Yesterday&apos;s Man, not yet at least - is next up, along with Great Britain&apos;s Craig Pickering.  2.58am: So far so good for Asafa, who jogs through to win in 10.16sec. Pickering runs an impressive 10.21 to finish third and qualify for the second round. The Brit seemed to require just a bit more effort, though.  3.12am: Off to the pool now, where Australia&apos;s Lethal Liesel Jones attempts to win an elusive Olympic gold medal, in the 200m breaststroke final.  3.16am: And it remains elusive for the Australian. Rebecca Soni of the US has no trouble keeping up with the Jones girl and trumps her on the last leg to win the gold medal in 2min 20.22sec. That&apos;s another world record in the Cube - is it time we introduced handicaps?  3.24am: To the men&apos;s 200m backstroke final, and for once the name Phelps is nowhere to be seen on the results board. Of course, that&apos;s because he&apos;s not in the race, which was won by his fellow American Ryan Lochte in 1:53.94. Another world record? Silly question. GB&apos;s Gregor Tait finishes eighth in 1:57, and announces he&apos;s going off to Australia for a while. Finishing eighth isn&apos;t that bad, surely?  3.29am: Back to the track, and the US of A&apos;s Tyson Gay eases into the 100m second round in 10.22m, slower than his two main rivals but we&apos;re talking 0.02sec difference across the three sprinters. Splitting hairs at this stage, perhaps.  3.32am: Hang on a second, says Great Britain&apos;s Tyrone Edgar, who coasts to victory in the following 100m heat in 10.13sec. Cuts a glance across the line as if to say: &quot;Don&apos;t you forget about me, don&apos;t, don&apos;t, don&apos;t, don&apos;t.&quot;  3.37am: Humble apologies to Liesel Jones, who of course won the 100m breaststroke gold medal this week. Think I was sleeping at the time. Nice to know you&apos;re out there, readers.  3.50am: Here comes Mr Phelps. Five golds so far and now on the blocks for a sixth here in the 200m individual medley.  3.55am: Another gold, another world record. The American master touches in 1:54.23 for gold No6. GB&apos;s James Goddard finishes sixth in 1:59.24 while Liam Tancock is eighth in 2:00.76. Read the full report on Phelps&apos; latest triumph  3.58am: Shamini from Singapore writes to offer this early-morning brainwave on how to make these Olympics better: &quot;Why not superimpose Brad Pitt&apos;s head on Phelps for TV? The greatest athlete in the world but let&apos;s face it - those ears, the dorky grin... substitution warranted?? (I don&apos;t mean that Brad Pitt should get the medals - although perhaps he could have a copy).&quot; I reckon it&apos;s some of the events that lack spark. If beach volleyball gets a starter&apos;s shirt, why not let WWE wrestlers have a crack at Olympic medals? Imagine Batista preparing to finish off John Cena and claim gold, only for JBL to arrive on the scene and smash a chair over the Animal&apos;s head? Now that&apos;s an Olympic sport.  4.05am: GB&apos;s Elizabeth Simmonds qualifies seventh for the women&apos;s 200m backstroke final after finishing her semi-final in 2:08.96. Gemma Spofforth just misses out.  4.10am: Fran Halsall is GB&apos;s hope in the 100m freestyle final, but she&apos;s up against the world record holder Lisbeth Trickett, even though the Australian is in lane 8 here.  4.14am: Tricky for Trickett to win from out there, though, and she&apos;s trumped - just - by Germany&apos;s Britta Steffan in 53.12. That&apos;s a new Olympic record, which is a nice change from all those dull world marks being set.  4.16am: &quot;With all of these new world records being set,&quot; says reader Richard Greaves, &quot;has anyone actually thought to measure the pool to check that it is indeed the required 50m? Just a thought!&quot;  4.24am: Bird&apos;s Nest-bound now, for heats nine and 10 in the men&apos;s 100m. GB&apos;s big hope, Simeon Williamson, emerges for the final heat.  4.25am: Third and through for Williamson. That&apos;s three Brits qualifying for the second round, to be run at lunchtime today. Read Paul Kelso&apos;s report  4.36am: GB&apos;s Jemma Simpson finishes fourth in her 800m heat in 2:02.16, and the former Neighbours extra faces a nervous wait to see if she makes it into the semi-finals.  4.41am: Jenny Simpson squeezes into the semis with apparent ease, the Brit finishing third in her heat in 2:00.33.  4.53am: Quick results scan: In the women&apos;s basketball, the Czech Republic have beaten New Zealand 90-59; Spain have toppled China 2-1 in the men&apos;s hockey; and the host nation has also suffered defeat in the women&apos;s handball, losing to Kazakhstan 29-26.  4.59am: North Korean shooting silver medallist Kim Jong-su has tested positive for a banned substance and been excluded from the Games, the International Olympic Committee says this morning. A Vietnamese artistic gymnast, who finished out of the medals, has also tested positive for a banned substance, she said. I&apos;ve just had a coffee, but I&apos;m sure it&apos;s far from performance-enhancing. Sigh.  5.01am: In the men&apos;s table tennis, Austria account for Croatia 3-1 and Hong Kong topple Taiwan 3-0 in the bronze medal play-offs.  5.06am: Alarm bells are ringing for Asafa Powell, who has complained of a stomach problem following his 100m first-round win this morning. Read Paul Kelso&apos;s report.  5.10am: Back at the table tennis, the US beat Romania 3-1 and Japan beat Austria 3-0 in the women&apos;s team bronze medal playoffs.  5.11am: &quot;My wife and I were wondering what to start training our 10-month-old boy in so that he&apos;s ready for 2012,&quot; writes Alex in Sydney. &quot;As he&apos;s small and shouts a lot do you think being the cox of the rowing eight would be a good target?&quot; Either that, or a broadcaster perhaps.  5.20am: Artur Ayvazian of Ukraine wins gold in the men&apos;s 50m prone rifle, shooting past Matt Emmons of the US in the final round. Australia&apos;s Warren Potent claims the bronze.  5.31am: Over at the fencing, we have the men&apos;s team epee quarter-finals. China pip Hungary 45-43, Poland pummel Ukraine 45-37, Italy do likewise to South Korea 45-37, and France breeze past Venezuela 45-33.  5.40am: Well, it&apos;s time for a baton change. As the sun rises over Guardianland I&apos;ll toddle off now before my eyes file an official complaint. Disappointing that they&apos;re revolting, but they&apos;re often shortsighted when it comes to work. Over to strong, strong runner Alan Gardner.  5.49am: &apos;Sup? Big praise indeed from Russell... I&apos;ve been limbering up in the background, and he must have noticed my impressive calves. Although, my desk-accustomed frame has got nothing on either the gymnasts or the beach volleyballers who are currently occupying my attention. And I think the US girls have just nailed their routines in the women&apos;s all-around. Is it going to be a dainty slap upside the head for China?  5.54am: Chants of USA! USA! USA! in the National Indoor Stadium. Shawn Johnson, the pint-sized princess of American gymnastics - who appears to have been confected entirely from pink satin and sunbeams - is lapping up the applause. Blue Peter&apos;s Matt Baker doesn&apos;t think she&apos;s quite done enough though...  5.57am: USA! USA! USA! take gold... and silver. China will have to suck their thumb whilst clutching bronze. Baker called it: Johnson had to settle for second; but Nastia Liukin, also a Yank, picked up gold. Britain&apos;s Becky Downie finished a respectable 12th.  6.00am: Psychedelic cartoon alert. Must mean it&apos;s time for Olympic Breakfast, with the Beeb&apos;s finest. Once the animated pigs and monkeys have trotted off, of course... Opinions on Jamie Hewlett&apos;s creations? Personally, it seems to have sod all to do with the Games - but looks quite nice.  6.05am: And welcome to the global conversation, Australia: &quot;Where are Britain&apos;s next six gold medals coming from then?&quot; flaming galas Adrian Hill. &quot;If the Brits are going to beat Australia, that&apos;s what you&apos;ll need. As for the overall medals count, roll on 2012, eh?&quot; Well, Adrian, may I point you in the direction of this little section of our site? On yer bike, mate.  6.10am: Not a whole lorra &apos;lympics going on at the moment, as far as I can tell, not least because BBC1 have decided that some events in this country are in some way newsworthy, which I doubt, frankly. Anyway, as part of their services to japery and clowning around, those zany Spaniards have been at it again. When will they learn...?  6.13am: Team GB sailing You&apos;d have thought with all the corporate suits and politico types guffing their way around Beijing, such a lack wouldn&apos;t be problematic, but we currently have no sailing over in Qingdao because there&apos;s no wind. Ainslie and the Yngling girls are cooling their heels, and possibly drinking some lovely, lovely green tea.  6.17am: Team GB athletics Yes, that does read athletics. Kelly Sotherton, one of only two people in Britain who can run without her legs falling off, is doing a cracking job over in the heptathlon. Last I heard she&apos;d gone over 1.77m in the high jump, but it looks like she may have just bettered that.  6.20am: Sotherton knocks the bar off at 1.83m, but I think, in going over 1.80m, she&apos;s already set a new PB. The American, Hayleas Fountain leads after storming through the 100m hurdles this morning. But Kelly&apos;s just floated over at 1.83m!!! G&apos;wan Kel!  6.26am: Team GB archery Alan Wills&apos; defeat in the men&apos;s singles is being re-lived on the Beeb, while Eurosport have gone with this morning&apos;s 100m heats. Meanwhile, Andrew Jolly has joined the Aussie de-baiting: &quot;Yes, as a Brit living in Australia, I&apos;ve been talking up our cycling team whilst the Aussies sweep up at the swimming (except this morning where Libby &amp; Liesel threw it away). It&apos;s a good job choking isn&apos;t an attribute of supposedly superior British sports people. Eh? Oh.&quot; And some classic self-deprecation to round things off. Mr Jolly, you are wasted down there.  6.31am: Seems the Team GB website tells lies about our Kelly, who has in fact jumped 1.87m before. Anyway, there&apos;s some judo going on, and some badminton... not that we have much interest in either now.  6.34am: Acronym fun, with Al Parkes. &quot;As for yngling [cf. yesterday&apos;s MBM, 7.15am], when faced with &apos;epee&apos;, and thinking it might be a typo, I googled it and the first thing that caught my eye was &apos;european partnership for energy and the environment&apos;&quot; writes Al. &quot;Sounds worthy, but what do the participants actually do? Do they win points for the extent to which they &apos;reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of refrigerants&apos;?&quot; Another convoluted Olympic sport in the offing, maybe.  6.40am: Cuba and the US are locked at 2-2 in the blurnsball. Still not enough wind for the sailors to have a paddle, so we&apos;re reduced to Uzbekistan v Poland in the men&apos;s judo.  6.44am: Mr Jolly cranks up the pressure on the MBM team (me). &quot;For some reason, Channel 7 and SBS in Australia aren&apos;t covering the athletics today - at the moment we have the mouthwatering choice of Chinese Taipei vs Hong Kong in table tennis or Australia vs Holland in water polo (we don&apos;t have new fangled things like &apos;the red button&apos;) down under yet.&quot; Cue, dramatic music and scenes of MBMer perspiring profusely: &quot;We&apos;re relying completely on MBM to know how the lovely Kelly et al are getting on.&quot; Well, er... I, er, hang on... just let me switch the chann... bye!  6.50am: Fleeing MBMer hits electrified fence around Rebranded Website compound and is corralled back to his seat. Never fear, text-based sports commentary fans, I&apos;m still here. Not much to report on viz. Ms Sotherton, as there are about 313 competitors in the heptathlon so the high jump wil be some time in finishing. More scandal news, however. According to Reuters, the Chinese faked the ethnicity of some of the kids at the opening ceremony. For shame.  6.55am: More people in need, this time Amy from America and Max from Germany who are &quot;on hols without TV and are counting on you!&quot; Great. At least their request is simple. Yes, Amy and Max, Germany do have eight golds, our table is just reluctant to acknowledge the facts currently.  7.00am: An Estonian judoka is trying to give his Brazilian opponent what looks like a chinese burn. Must be something in the Beijing air. Meanwhile, word is that Kel failed at 1.83m, so my earlier optimism was misplaced/erroneous.  7.03am: Peru v Cuba on the mat... and Cuba hands out some ippon pain straight away. Still 2-2 in the baseball.  7.07am: If you missed the exciting denouement to USA! USA! USA! crushing &apos;One World. One Dream&apos; China in the gymnastics earlier, why not read the full report here. The fun part is... wait for it, wait for it... really, a Russian won. What a delightful Cold War triptych, eh.  7.12am: Are you listening, Australia? You&apos;re rubbish. Or words to that effect. &quot;As a Brit living in Brisbane, i&apos;m wondering if the Aussies, following on from the rugby world cup - where the rules must now be changed so that a team with no scrum can win - will now float some ELVs for swimming,&quot; enquires John Davis, with a mischievous grin all over his mush. &quot;I mean the Americans getting from the start to the finish in the fastest time, whilst following a straight line, is something of a hollow victory isn&apos;t it?&quot;  7.17am: Chiles shows some love. The Beeb are running (Australian former world record holder) Leisel Jones choking in the 200m breaststroke again, from earlier this morning. But before that, we had Adrian Chiles flapping his chops about the Guardian and in particular this piece on Michael Phelps&apos; diet. And if you&apos;d like to see a normal person (Jon Henley) try and tackle that amount of calories, click here.  7.21am: Team GB judo Some results: Kim Nayoung (South Korea) beat Nihel Cheikh Rouhou (Tunisia)Tong Wen (China) beat Maryna Prokofyeva (Ukraine)Idalys Ortiz (Cuba) beat Samah Ramadan (Egypt)Lucija Polavder (Slovenia) beat Gulzhan Issanova (Kazakhstan)Janelle Shepherd (Australia) beat Sandra Koeppen (Germany)Tserenkhand Dorjgotov (Mongolia) beat Carola Uilenhoed (Netherlands)Vanessa Zambotti (Mexico) beat Karina Bryant (Britain)Maki Tsukada (Japan) beat Anne-Sophie Mondiere (France) We&apos;re down to &apos;golden score&apos; in the men&apos;s judo, France v Uzbekistan. Can you contain your, etc and so forth...  7.25am: No sailing, remember, due to a lack of wind. The French judoka, who looks like a bear, is taking it to the Uzbeki, who looks like an accountant.  7.35am: Some of our top stories now up in the standfirst, there. Bit of a newspapery word, standfirst. You and I can call it, &apos;slightly washed-out text beneath the headline&apos;, if you like. And news of some disqualifications for nasty drug cheats, brought to you with nothing more than the pure blood, sweat and tears of the Guardian team.  7.38am: Upstanding fellow and noble Englishman-on-foreign-shores Andrew Jolly is disappointed with the complete lack of &apos;bring it&apos; being shown by Australian readers. &quot;Typical, they start off the sledging, fueled by weak beer and sunstroke, but as soon as a couple of Brits slap them around a bit back they go, retreating to the BBQ...&quot; complains Andy, who likes a sporting contest.  7.44am: Sotherton watch It seems that in the confusion and to-and-fro of instantaneous reporting, Kelly did indeed clear 1.83m, but that wasn&apos;t quite up there with some of the best. She&apos;s lying in fifth, after the two events so far, and you can read some proper journalism on the subject here.  7.48am: The American with the barmy handle, Hyleas Fountain, is top o&apos;the tree in the heptathlon. Clare Balding loves Kelly Sotherton &quot;because she&apos;s got attitude&quot;. And cos she&apos;s such a feisty type, the bods on the BBC couch reckon she&apos;ll have been none too pleased about having to wait two hours to have a go on the high jump.  7.56am: Brett Badger, who refuses to declare himself as an Australian but probably is, weighs in for the Sheilas: &quot;l must admit to being a little confused by all this British babble. Perhaps the medal tally l am looking at which shows Australia miles ahead of our Imperial Overlords is wrong?&quot; [at this point Badger, whose name sounds made up, proffers a link to the Guardian medal table, mocking us with our own fancy technology] &quot;Or am l to understand we are being criticised for not being further ahead of Team GB? OK, l guess that would fit in with the general self flagellating principles of British sport.&quot; It is customary to let the hare get well out in front before it is overhauled, Brett. In this case by a tortoise on an advanced carbon fibre bicycle.  8.00am: While Gary Naylor endures a Kluft-less and therefore Sotherton-less broadcasting landscape in Sweden, I&apos;m stuck with reruns and news segments. Oh, and USA 3-3 Cuba in the baseball. &quot;With no Kluft-mania to drive the coverage here in Sweden, television has cut away from the Bird&apos;s Nest and is now showing Germany vs Sweden in the women&apos;s handball,&quot; laments Gary. &quot;You wouldn&apos;t think it would be possible to make 14 super-fit, Amazonian, European women a-stretching and a-straining dull. But handball manages it.&quot; To be honest, I&apos;d like to take an objective decision for myself on that one, but not even the internet can help me here (and don&apos;t get cheeky...)  8.10am: Team GB Up later, there&apos;ll be some rowing, with Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter in the men&apos;s lightweight double sculls. The cycling - also known as the basket in which I&apos;ve placed all my eggs in a verbal spat with Australia - should start in an hour or so, where the Brits will be looking to vanquish the French.  8.15am: Andrew Jolly, my partner in crimes against the Australian nation, is beginning to get the wobbles after Brett Badger&apos;s robust assault: &quot;We (the British) are going to look right stupid a bit later on if we all fall off [our bikes]. Actually, as we&apos;ve talked it up a fair amount, we&apos;re going to look right stupid if we don&apos;t win 10 gold medals. Not that I&apos;m stepping back towards my BBQ, Agincourt spirit and all that...&quot; Badger, real name or not, you&apos;ve certainly brought it.  8.23am: Team GB athletics Marilyn Okoro and Jenni Meadows both qualified for the 800m earlier. Not sure we mentioned Marilyn at the time. There&apos;s one track gold up for grabs today, but it&apos;s not till much later (3.45pm BST). Oh, and in the Amazon-ball, it seems to be Germany 26-27 Sweden... but I&apos;m not really sure how the scoring works. Maybe Gary Naylor can help?  8.29am: News on the baseball from Kyle Hauptman, who has Sydney and Tokyo numbers in his email signature, so I&apos;m going to assume is approximately somewhere in the middle of the Philippines. China 8-7 Chinese TaipeiCuba 5-4 USA The spectre of communism is haunting baseball, then. Or something.  8.35am: Almost time for me to chuck in the towel and head home for some kip. Howard Swains will be taking over from me, and he&apos;s a stirling chap with a full head of glorious hair. Get ready though, cos some Brits appear to be out on the lake at Shunyi...  8.43am: OK, something got lost there in the transition in personnel, but it seems that Britain finished fifth in the lake which, ordinarily, is never good enough to qualify. I&apos;ll try to confirm that failure momentarily, but I think we can assume the British pair are out.  8.47am: Prepared introduction: Morning again to all, and welcome back to Beijing, being brought to you via a tiny Hitachi screen and an uncertain internet connection channelling an uncertain web-stream. These are the mysteries unravelled. This is the greatest show on earth which, incidentally, is also the name of a song by the rather excellent Felice Brothers that appeared on my I-Pod this morning. &quot;I&apos;m in a suit of burgundy/There&apos;s a deerhead lookin&apos; at me/It&apos;s blowin my mind away.&quot; That is what it&apos;s like at Guardian Towers on day seven of the Olympics.  Today&apos;s deerhead will be eyeing some canoe/kayaking, some archery, some judo, weightlifting, fencing, shot put, badminton, athletics (where Kelly Sotherton in the heptathlon is the main British attraction) and the chance of some British metal acquisition in the cycling. I haven&apos;t so far presided over a single British medal win, but have high hopes for today. The wind has even got up in the right place, offering the prospect of some sailing, and died down elsewhere, permitting some rowing, both of which were postponed yesterday. The official Beijing Olympics website sometimes struggles to keep up with what&apos;s going on around the whole Games, which can throw us (OK, me) for a loop. Please send in your observations, comments, complaints and typo-spots to hswains@gmail.com.  8.48am: Unprepared introduction: Some women rowers have just come fifth in the sculling and have not qualified for the final. &quot;We gave it our best shot and it&apos;s really, really gutting not to reach the final,&quot; says Helen Casey. Her ship-mate Hester Goodsell is similarly disappointed. &quot;We&apos;re just not quite there yet,&quot; she says. &quot;Have a good scull tomorrow,&quot; pipes up Steve Redgrave.  8.51am: Turns out that this telly is actually a Tosumi, not a Hitachi as previously advertised. In the second sculling semi-final, Canada beat China who beat Greece.  8.54am The British men have just started their semi-final in the double sculls. &quot;What a fascinating six minutes this will be,&quot; insists John Inverdale.  8.58am: The British pair -- Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter -- are way out in front at the half-way mark, leading the Cubans, Italians and French boats. This one is in the bag.  9.02am: Purchase and Hunter cruise into the final of the men&apos;s lightweight double sculls with a comfortable victory in the semi finals. Italy and Cuba come second and third. The final is not for another 48 hours, but there are now very high hopes for gold in the lake.  This from table-tennis correspondent Tim Maitland: &quot;Alan teased us with a mention of the Hong Kong v Chinese Taipei table tennis match, without giving the result or capturing the humungous importance of it. Hong Kong&apos;s first medal of the Games! A 3-0 sweep of the-island-otherwise-known-as-Taiwan in the bronze medal match, sealed by Athens-silver-medal-winning legends Li Ching and Ko Lai-Chak in the doubles.&quot; That&apos;s that covered.  9.03am: Drug cheat news:  North Korean shooter Kim Jong Su has been stripped of his two medals for failing a drugs test. I&apos;m actually not sure how &quot;new&quot; this news is, but I hadn&apos;t noticed it yet, even though there&apos;s an article being fed onto the Guardian website about it.  9.10am: Here are our options for live coverage: Clare Balding in ravishing pink, women&apos;s 75kg weightlifting, women&apos;s team semi-final table tennis, boxing or sailing. Over to you. (Bear in mind that one email vote would probably win this.)  9.16am: I&apos;m watching some sailing at the moment because there appear to be a British boat involved, skippered (is that the right word?) by Ben Ainslie, who is a definite medal prospect. There&apos;s some terrific rhythmic chanting going on courtesy of the Chinese fans on the harbour side, but otherwise I&apos;m at a bit of a loss as to what&apos;s really going on. In the rowing lake, Greece beat Denmark beat China in the second lightweight sculls semi-final.  9.17am: Joe Milton wants boxing; Julian Wilson wants Clare Balding in the weightlifting. That&apos;s a dead heat, so I&apos;m sticking with the sailing.  9.20am: They&apos;ve started a 5-minute, 16-boat race in the sailing and deciphering is currently is progress. Meanwhile, the first semi-final of the lightweight fours has just ended in the rowing lake, and Poland won, with Canada and Holland in their slipstream.  9.22am: British interests take precedence here, and the men&apos;s lightweight fours -- Chambers, Lindsay-Fynn, Mattick and Clarke -- are going in lane two of the rowing lake, against Ireland, Denmark, France, Italy and the USA. Britain are current world champions, so are hotly tipped. And they&apos;re off.  9.26am: Britain lead. Gary Naylor is in Sweden, and Ranil Dissanayake, who claims to be our most exotically-located reader, being based in Malawi, says &quot;Boxing! Boxing!&quot; on the grounds that: &quot;The skills are all there without any of the queasy liberal guilt of watching the pros maim each other without the protection.&quot; Hold still, let&apos;s get this rowing out the way, and I&apos;ll check back on the pugilists.  9.28am: Denmark have gone into the lead against Great Britain in the rowing after 1,500m. This is only the semi-final, remember, so second is good enough to go through. Ben Ainslie is ahead in his race in the Finn class sailing.  9.30am: Great Britain qualify in third place in the men&apos;s lightweight fours. Denmark win the semi-final, France are second, but the World Champions (that&apos;ll be the Brits) are through. Ireland were fourth, and have another chance to qualify in some kind of race off.  9.32am:  Dan Smith has the coveted 9.32am update all to himself: &quot;Can I be the first to mark Team GB&apos;s triumphant Government funded march to 2012? We seem to be working with an illustrious combination of reliable bankers (sailing, rowing, cycling), relatively impressive stasis (white water canoeing, 3-day eventing), individual excellence marred by appalling relay error (swimming), slight improvement unnoticed because it&apos;s so far down the field (gymnastics) decline (badminton, archery), marked decline (shooting), predicted continued decline (athletics), irreversible decline/abject embarrassing failure (judo), more abject failure (diving), ridiculous hype coupled with abject embarrassing failure at both individual and organisational level (boxing, see Frankie Gavin) and non-qualification (almost everything else).&quot;  9.34am: At the third mark in the yngling race, the Dutch team are ahead, with the Brits in third. Ben Ainslie, in the Finn class, is &quot;doing what he does best&quot; according to the Beeb&apos;s enthusiastic boat-bound commentator, who is kind of angular and looks as though he&apos;s peering into the back of a spoon.  9.40am: Apologies to Irish rowing fans, your boys are out. They get to race in the B final, but can&apos;t qualify for the final, as Joanne Harris, a Brit in New Zealand has just emailed to tell me. If anyone knows the point of the B final, please let me know. Meanwhile, the Slovak brothers Pavol and Peter Hochschorner have won gold in the men&apos;s canoe doubles. Having improbably enough spent three months in Slovakia last year, I can tell you those Hochschorners are heroes over there.  9.44am: They&apos;re preparing for action in the velodrome, the second heat of the men&apos;s team sprint. Greece go up against Malaysia. Britain are up in heat six. Wow, that was quick. It&apos;s all over in just over 44 seconds, with Malaysia winning it.  9.50am: China against Japan in heat six in the velodrome, and it&apos;s a disaster for Japan, one of those three riders has a problem with his back wheel and drops out right at the start. A puncture, it seems, as a Chinese Wile E. Coyote is seen creeping out of the arena carrying a box of ACME tacks.  9.53am: Thanks again to Joanne Harris for her insight into the rowing. &quot;And the point of the B final?&quot; she writes. &quot;It&apos;s about the same as the point of the C and D finals (and E and F, for the singles at these Olympics). It&apos;s for FISA (the international rowing federation) placings, so the minor rowing countries know where they&apos;ve come overall - funding within the countries can depend on it. It&apos;s not unimportant, given that 60 nations sent crews to the rowing in Beijing, and occasionally it pays off. Cuba beating Germany is priceless and definitely wouldn&apos;t have happened a few years ago.&quot; Excellent. I genuinely didn&apos;t know, so thanks for the info.  9.56am: Australia v Russia in the cycling, and the Aussies take it in 44.335seconds, which is the fastest yet. Russia were seventh fastest so far. The Japanese, meanwhile, didn&apos;t get a puncture, but one of their riders&apos; chain snapped, so they&apos;ll get another chance. Great Britain are up next. (And, Amy from America and Max from Germany, the Germany/Sweden women&apos;s handball finished 27-26 in favour of the Swedes.)  10am: Here it is then: Great Britain share the track with Germany in heat six. Britain are represented here by Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny and Jamie Staff. Staff goes like the wind in the first lap, Kenny takes over for the second, leaving Hoy to BREAK THE WORLD RECORD!!!  10.02am: GREAT BRITAIN BREAK THE WORLD RECORD IN THE HEATS OF THE TEAM SPRINT. It&apos;s a phenomenal achievement from Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy. Staff rides the fastest opening lap of any rider ever and Kenny/Hoy keep the pace to finish in 42.950 seconds. Their previous best was 43.777, so that&apos;s extraordinary. France and Holland go head to head in heat seven and the French posted the second-fastest time behind that universe best ever cycling feat by three men on two wheels and a bit of fibreglass EVER!  10.07am: Apparently, this cycling track in Beijing, the Laoshan Velodrome, was always expected to be a fast one, and that world record is not as surprising as it seemed to me (and to the cyclists&apos; mothers, who are all in the crowd and chewing on a British flag like it&apos;s a comfort blanky.) Again, over to you lot: how and why is one cycling track faster than another?  10.11am: Ben Ainslie guaranteed at least silver in Finn class sailing As all our (my) attention was on the velodrome, Ben Ainslie finished second in his latest race in the Finn class sailing and is now guaranteed at least a silver medal. There are two races left and gold is very much in his sights. If only everyone was either on a bike or a boat. Great Britain would rule the world.  10.15am: Simon Thomas is asking for trouble, or is at least encouraging me to get into trouble: &quot;Can you don your fashion critic hat for me and describe the plastic suits worn by our cycling heroes? I can&apos;t get to a telly so can&apos;t see for myself but I&apos;m hoping they&apos;ve kind of come over all batman on us.&quot; Well, there are no capes and there are no pointy ears but otherwise, yes.  10.20am: The men&apos;s individual pursuit cycling is now underway, and Brett Lancaster of Australia is fastest in the first heat. Steven Burke of the newly-enthused Team GB! GB! GB! goes in the second heat, which is starting .... now!  10.25am:  Steven Burke trounces his track-mate, the Colombian Alzate, lapping him in fact, and beats his own personal best by nine seconds. He finishes in 4.22.2, which puts him first from the four who have been out so far. More wonderful stuff from the British cyclists. Graham Pierce has the skinny on velodromes: &quot;Beijing is fast mainly because it&apos;s new and the surface is clean and blemish free. When velodromes periodically replace the boards speeds always pick up. The angle of banking and tightness of the curves is also a big factor, when the curves are tighter and G forces higher times suffer particularly in the sprint events. This was the case at the world champs in Los Angeles a few years ago. The weather conditions on the day also play a part and generally when it&apos;s warmer times are faster. Finally Moscow is known as a really fast track because the aircon system is set up to give the riders a tailwind right the way round the track.&quot; Is that really true about Moscow? Not that I&apos;m doubting, or anything, but isn&apos;t that like installing a huge fan underneath the pole vault run-up, or a motor on the back of a yngling boat?  10.29am: Another gold medal for Slovakia in the white water singles kayak as Elena Kaliska defends her Olympic championship. They&apos;re some canoe/kayakers are the Slovaks and they now move ahead of Team GB! GB! GB! in the medals table. They don&apos;t have quite the strength in depth in the cycling or sailing, however. So we&apos;ll be back.  10.35am: A couple more shiny hyper-links for you to click in the standfirst up there, which will take you through to stories about the cycling world record and Ben Ainslie&apos;s sailing antics.  10.40am: &quot;Was that really a world record for the cyclists?&quot; asks Andrew Jolly, who says that the Australian television coverage has not mentioned it at all. Well, everyone is still reporting that it&apos;s a world record, although the usually hyperbolic Press Association have included this caveat in their most recent dispatch: &quot;There is no world record for the event as the team sprint is held over three laps, regardless of the size of the track.&quot; They still lead the same piece with the line: &quot;Britain set up a great chance of winning the first gold medal awarded at the Laoshan Velodrome by qualifying for the first round of the team sprint in unofficial record time.&quot; So, if the track sizes vary, then there can&apos;t be any official world record, it seems. But it stands that the British trio have just recorded the fastest time ever in that event, and you can bet your life that if the Aussies had done it, news of a new world record would be all over the surf club and being shaved into Bouncer&apos;s soft labrador fur.  10.52am: OK, let&apos;s get a grip here. The individual pursuit is underway in the velodrome, with Bradley Wiggins up soon. The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze in their sailing class, and still have an outside chance of gold. Roger Federer&apos;s vanquisher James Blake is into a final set against Fernando Gonzalez in the tennis; Brazil are about to play Norway in the quarter finals of the women&apos;s football, and much, much more.  There&apos;s a lot of AAARRGGHHing coming my way from Alex Pace, who is watching the cycling in Australia. &quot;AAAARGGGHHHH,&quot; he aaarghhhs. &quot;In Australia, they are only showing the Aussie cyclists but even worse hey have put some ignorant Aussie buffoon in the commentary box with the commentating legend that is Phil Liggett, his sole purpose seems to be to interrupt, contradict and irritate the silver-tongued Liggett with observations about how BLOODY GREAT the Australian cyclists are. AAAAARGHHHHH.&quot;  10.59am: &quot;An under-ripe banana is as bad for you as a biscuit,&quot; says the commentator on the tennis. I&apos;m not sure who it is, but she follows up with: &quot;There&apos;s all sorts of banana analysis that&apos;s been done.&quot; Flicking through these internet streams is a lot like listening to snippets of conversations on the tube or something. There&apos;s probably some context, but it&apos;s usually missed. I&apos;m not sure what Gary Naylor is on about here, either, but it&apos;s always good to have him: &quot;Can anyone confirm if the crowd in Olympic velodrome has adopted the same practices as the crowds in the Belgian Six Day events - specifically, smoking, boozing and eating chips with mayonnaise? Possibly not, I suspect.&quot; And Roger Cook is thinking of shaving the world record cycling time in to his cats, photographs of which would persuade me to learn how to embed images into this minute-by-minute sports coverage tool to share with the world.  11.07am: Bradley Wiggins is on the track in the final heat of the individual pursuit. Steven Burke is still leading, I think, although Wiggins is da man. More on the is-it-isn&apos;t-it a world record in the team sprint comes courtesy of Simon Carmouche: &quot;Most but not all tracks are 250m, so it&apos;s not meaningless even though not official.&quot; Not meaningless, if not official. Is it wrong to adopt that as a life ambition?  11.10am: Bradley Wiggins eases to the fastest qualifying time in the individual pursuit, and sets a new Olympic record to boot. The time is 4.15.031. And he&apos;ll lead the New Zealander Haydn Rolleston when they reconvene.  11.13am: Wiggins was awesome there, and is a clear favourite for gold. Rolleston was second-fastest, then Markov, Dyadnya and then Steven Burke. Steven Gagola, who&apos;s pretty sharp on the old email, is angry: &quot;Your lack of info annoys me. So the British Yngling crew areguaranteed a bronze! Where are they on the current standings and wheredid they finish today?&quot; Sorry about that Steven, it did kind of creep up on us. They finished fifth in today&apos;s race 8, but still lead the overall standings, which look like this: 1 Gr Britain 22.0 pts, 2 Netherlands 23.0 pts, 3 Greece 42.0 pts, 4 United States 43.0 pts, 5 France 46.0 pts, 6 Russian Feder 46.0 pts, 7 China 47.0 pts, 8 Australia 49.0 pts, 9 Germany 52.0 pts, 10 Norway 57.0 pts, 11 Finland 60.0 pts, 12 S Africa 63.0 pts, 13 Canada 66.0 pts, 14 Spain 67.0 pts, 15 Italy 74.0 pts.  11.17am: The team pursuit semi-finals (or second round) are underway. I missed the first one -- these really do fly by -- but I understand that Australia won it, but that Germany recorded a faster time in the second. The British world record holders* are out soon. (*Not an official world record), but first we have Malaysia and France.  11.22am: The division of labour here in Guardian Towers is severely imbalanced. The entire media desk behind me are riveted by television coverage of a penguin being knighted at Edinburgh zoo by the Norwegian army. You. Couldn&apos;t. Make. It. Up. France won that team sprint against the Malaysians, and the French are quickest so far, from Germany and Australia.  11.24am: Team GB! GB! GB!&apos;s (unofficial) World Record holders are on the track. They&apos;re up against the United States. Here they go...  11.24 and 43.034 seconds am: Another superlative effort from Staff, Kenny and Hoy who, in that order, have taken the Brits through to the final to face France in the final of the team sprint. The bronze medal ride off will be between Germany and Australia.  11.26am: GB through to final in team sprint. Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will ride for the gold medal against France, a repeat of the World Championship final. Australia and Germany will contest the bronze, which will no doubt please Cameron McCallum, who I suspect is from Down Under: &quot;Just wondering why you&apos;re getting so excited about about a guaranteed bronze,&quot; says McCallum, mistaking this line &quot;The British Yngling crew -- Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson -- have now guaranteed at least bronze&quot; for excitement. &quot;That wouldn&apos;t even make the news in Australia. You can have a couple of ours for a while if it makes you feel better.&quot; Are they yours to give away Cameron?  11.34am: Some talking up, and some dressing down: &quot;Short of falling off, Brad Wiggins and the team sprinters must have golds in the bag. Or is that hubris?&quot; says Ga Naylor, obviously friendly enough with Mr Wiggins to drop the &quot;ley&quot;. For what it&apos;s worth, yes it&apos;s hubris, but let&apos;s hope it&apos;s not misplaced. Meanwhile Tim Chadderton and Paul McMillan are right to say I understated the Yngling team&apos;s chance of gold. They lead after eight races, so have it all to lose. Which, as it happens, etc., and so forth.  11.38am: I can&apos;t say I&apos;m all that keen on this, but my inbox is positively groaning from emails from you lot asking me to stick it to the Aussies. &quot;After tomorrow, we shan&apos;t need Cameron McCallum&apos;s hand outs, as I believe we will be above the Aussies in the medal table,&quot; says Richard Alderson, whose comments are fairly representative. Meanwhile the news wires report that Australian cyclists Brad McGee and Brett Lancaster are out of the individual pursuit, the event in which nice and British Bradley Wiggins seems nailed on for gold, and David Hopkins provides a link to an Australian newspaper story which details a Hong Kong man&apos;s attempt to have sex with a park bench. (Warning, link goes to story in an Australian newspaper about a Hong Kong man attempting to have sex with a park bench. With video of the rescue.)  11.46am: Claire Wright speaks for a lot of us here, but has made a mistake in thinking we can clear it up: &quot;So Bradley Wiggins can set a new Olympic record (11.10am), but (10.02am) the team sprint can&apos;t set a new world record. Did Wiggins cycle a set distance rather than number of laps so the length of track (11.07am comment) doesn&apos;t matter?&quot; I really, really don&apos;t know. The television coverage definitely flashed up &quot;Olympic record&quot; for Wiggins, and also flashed up the same for the team sprint. It didn&apos;t, thinking about it now, flash up &quot;World record&quot;, however. Official/unofficial, Olympic/World. Who cares, huh? GB! GB! GB!  11.53am: Roget Federer&apos;s vanquisher James Blake and Fernando Gonzalez are involved in a titanic battle on the tennis court. It&apos;s eight games all in the final set (of three) with no tie-break in sight. I actually wrote about this earlier, but those computer gremlins seem to have deleted it. This happens a lot.  11.55am: The velodrome is now hosting the women&apos;s 3,000m individual pursuit, in which GB! GB! GB! is represented Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero (if the British Olympic team website is correct, which I hope it is). &quot;In disciplines like the team sprint where the event can be raced over non-standard tracks (thus the distance can vary) the terminology for the British team&apos;s achievement is &quot;world best&quot;,&quot; asserts John Ogmore, and earns my gratitude. &quot;On events like the 4000m pursuit the fixed distance allows it to be called a world record no matter which track it is ridden on.&quot; Thanks to all, who said much the same thing.  12pm: Houvenaghel has started her individual pursuit and is in pursuit of/being pursued by the American cyclist Sarah Hammer. The Brit is a second ahead after 2km.  12.05pm: Wendy Houvenaghel sets a personal best of 3mins28.443secs in the 3,000m individual pursuit, the fastest time after five heats. Rebecca Romero is next up, against Katie Mactier, of Australia.  12.08pm Fernando Gonzalez has broken James Blake&apos;s serve and is now serving for the match at 10-9 in the final set. Meanwhile Rebecca Romero trounced her Aussie opponent in the individual pursuit and is the second fastest qualifier, behind her team-mate Wendy Houvenaghel. Have some bold text: Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero qualify first and second fastest in the women&apos;s 3,000m individual pursuit.  12.11pm: Are you watching Cameron McCullum? If so, you&apos;ve just seen your country miss out on third place in the men&apos;s team sprint, as Germany edged it on the line to take the bronze medal race. It&apos;s the final next, between France and GB! GB! GB!  12.15pm: GB! GB! GB! win GOLD in men&apos;s team sprint Terrific stuff from the British cycling team, who set a world best in the heat, cruised through the semi and have now completed the gold medal charge by thrashing the French team, who take silver. Delirious scenes. GB! GB! GB!  12.20pm: Jamie Staff, Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy will soon be on the podium with a big chunk of gold around their neck. Staff was characteristically exceptional in the first leg, Kenny kept the pace over the second and Hoy anchored it perfectly. Gonzalez beat Blake in the tennis, by the way.  12.27pm: Over to the National Stadium, Beijing, for the heats of the men&apos;s 1,500m. Andy Baddeley goes in one of these heats for GB! GB! GB! and has the British commentators all afluster. In the tennis, Gonzalez will play either Novak Djokovic or Rafael Nadal in the final. Their semi takes place later today. &quot;Is Cameron McCullum&apos;s e-mail the most ill-timed piece of jingoistic tub-thumping, or was it simply the dawning realisation that he is fast running out of time to make such a comment?&quot; asks Robert Hill. Timing, as any comedian will tell you, is 90 percent perspiration.  12.30pm: Tom Lancashire, the British &quot;hope&quot; in the second heat of the men&apos;s 1,500m finishes out of the qualification places in seventh. A 19-year-old Kenyan, whose name is on the tip of my fingers, wins it.  12.37pm: Andy Baddely leaves it late but looks comfortable in the third heat of the 1,500m to qualify. He sits at the back of the pack for the first couple of laps, which frightens Bredan Foster in the commentary box, but edges forward through the final 600m and comes good on the back straight, where he is forced wide but has the savvy to get into the first few across the line. Five qualify and he&apos;s safely through in fourth. &quot;I..puff...thought...puff...it...puff...was...puff...bang...on,&quot; says Baddely himself.  12.40pm The heptathletes are back in town and that means Kelly Sotherton. Her first put in the shot put goes 13.87m which is &quot;solid enough&quot; according to someone who knows more than me. Just previously, Anna Bogdanova put one 14.04, which is presumably more solid.  12.46pm: &quot;I&apos;ve never heard of this &quot;on the tip of my fingers&apos; guy,&quot; zings Chris Riley. &quot;What&apos;s his previous form?&quot; Don&apos;t know about other events, but he seems to win a lot when I&apos;m on M-B-M duty. I still can&apos;t actually find out the winners of those 1,500m heats, but assume they&apos;ll be filtering onto our results page soon-ish.  12.53pm: It&apos;s the men&apos;s 100m second round now, and Gay, Powell and Bolt are all comfortably through from the first round. Simeon Williamson, who previously boasted that he&apos;s a medal prospect, is in the first race. And he&apos;s out. He finished fourth, with the top three qualifying, who were: Churandy Martina, from Michael Frater and Naoki Tsukahara. Williamson is &quot;going back to the drawing room&quot; according to his post-race interview.  1pm: Tyson Gay goes in the second round two race. Metre-by-metre coverage has proven to be just a pipe dream, incidentally. There&apos;s a false start before they finally get away and Richard Thompson from Trinidad and Tobago wins it in 9.99, after a slow start. Gay is comfortably through in second, but looked a touch rusty. He&apos;ll need to improve.  1.03pm: &quot;This &quot;on the tips of my fingers&quot; implies that you are actually typing this,&quot; says Simon Martin. &quot;This is a revelation. I previously pictured you lot sunk into a big armchair in front of a large TV barking dictation to some poor sod on minimum wage.&quot; That, Simon, is over-by-over cricket coverage you&apos;re talking about. &quot;Toss another typo in the mix, intern. Keep them on their toes.&quot;  1.07pm: Another false start in the third round-two 100m race allows some football updates or, more precisely, a solitary football update. the Brazilian women are through to the final after beating Norway 2-1. Dinara Safina has taken the first set off Jelena Jankovic in the women&apos;s tennis semi-final.  1.09pm: GB! GB! GB!&apos;s Tyrone Edgar finishes third in his second-round heat of the 100m in 10.10 and goes through to tomorrow&apos;s semi final. Marc Burns wins it, Kim Collins is second and they both qualify alongside Edgar.  1.11pm: Tempted as I am to fill this MBM with the non-stop barrage of anti-Australian sentiment that is pouring into my inbox, I do want to get served in the bars of Earls Court next time I go there, so I&apos;m going to have to omit most of it. Andrew Jolly, Alex Pace and Chris Bridge, are suffering at the hands of the Australian broadcasters, meanwhile, and have been forced to watch handball and gymnastics repeats instead of the British cycling win. Bridge offers: &quot;If two slugs were crawling up a wall and one was painted green and gold it would make the news here.&quot;  1.15pm: That is absolutely extraordinary. Usain Bolt has just jogged to victory in the fourth 100m second-round heat, running 9.92secs without even breaking sweat. &quot;How much is still in the engine?&quot; asks the track-side commentator. &quot;A lot,&quot; Bolt replies. It really was amazing: he hardly seemed to strain at all and yet won by a mile. Craig Pickering, of GB! GB! GB! finished back in sixth in 10.18 and does not qualify. &quot;I&apos;m gutted,&quot; says Pickering. &quot;Congratulations,&quot; says the interviewer, inappropriately.  1.20pm: Asafa Powell also ambles into tomorrow&apos;s semi-finals, winning his heat in 10.02 but no less comfortably than Bolt. Walter Dix, of the United States, is second and Derrick Atkins third. There are no Brits. Pay attention to John Davis: &quot;Ease up on the pre-emptive gloating with the Aussies eh? Remember that we are British and that the order of the Universe requires that the wheels fall off (probably literally) our gold medal charge soon.&quot;  1.26pm: Replays of the Usain Bolt run are now on repeat on the telly, and rightly so. &quot;What am I supposed to say?&quot; says Michael Johnson, who is paid to say something in the BBC commentary box. &quot;We&apos;re pretty much guaranteed a world record in the 100 metres,&quot; he adds. Kelly Sotherton holds onto fifth place in the heptathlon after the shot put, although her best throw was way short of her personal best, and Nataliia Dobrynska broke the record for a heptathlete in that event and leapt up to second in the leaderboard.  1.32pm: Turns out -- as many of you have pointed out -- that I understated the extent of the Yngling team&apos;s achievement earlier. The always-accurate television is confidently declaring that they&apos;re set for at least silver and not at least bronze, as previously reported. They&apos;re one point ahead of the Holland crew and simply need to finish in front of the Dutch to win.  1.35pm: As the BBC show footage of three tearful British cyclists -- Messrs Staff, Kelly and Hoy -- receiving their gold medals for team sprint triumph, news reaches that a French team -- presumably Messrs Porthos, Athos and Aramis -- has won the men&apos;s epee competition, catapulting France ahead of Britain in the medal table. &quot;Forget the negativity - talk it up!&quot; booms Richard Greaves, who actually just wants to tell us that he&apos;s going to the Games tomorrow. &quot;There are plenty more medals to come from our velodrome boys and girls (well there had better be, I&apos;m going tomorrow night and Monday).&quot;  1.45pm: Back to the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, where Helen Clitheroe goes in the heats of the 3,000m steeplechase, an event making its Olympic debut in Beijing (the women&apos;s version, at least). They&apos;re not talking up her chances, mind you, with ten of the field having run faster than Clitheroe&apos;s personal best.  1.49pm Here&apos;s something about the steeplechase I&apos;ve just learned from Wikipedia (which is the sole reason that A Level pass rates continue to rise, in my opinion. Wikipedia, not the steeplechase): &quot;The event originated in the British Isles. Runners raced from one town&apos;s steeple to the next. The steeples were used as markers due to their visibility over long distances. Along the way runners inevitably had to jump creeks and low stone walls separating estates.&quot; I like the use of the word &quot;inevitably&quot; there, as if there aren&apos;t two steeples in the entire land without a couple of creeks and stone walls between them. Clitheroe is going great guns, by the way, and is on course for a British record.  1.52pm Helen Clitheroe finishes sixth in the 3,000m steeplechase. It&apos;s probably not good enough to qualify (top four go through, plus a couple of fastest losers from three races), but it&apos;s a massive personal best, 10 seconds better than she&apos;s ever run before, a British record, and we&apos;ll give her a big Team GB! GB! GB! pat on the back for that.  1.57pm: &quot;Your etymology of steeplechase is interesting, but refers to the horseback version I feel. I know this because of pictures on biscuit tins.&quot; Nope, Gary Naylor, nope. You and your biscuit tins can eat this link which takes you to the athletics disambiguation of steeplechase. In another heat, incidentally, there was a huge pile up over the water jump and I suspect some photographers will have got it. Check out our weird Olympic photos gallery, where I expect it to appear overnight.  2.08pm: More steeplechase news and it&apos;s of the &quot;agonising&quot; variety for Team GB and brave Helen Clitheroe in particular. Despite fearing her run wouldn&apos;t be good enough, she was given massive hope throughout the final heat when she seemed set to go through as one of the three fastest losers. But at the last minute, an Italian athlete just pipped her and it will be her to who will have to do all that running between the Beijing steeples over creeks and walls again on Sunday. Hard luck Helen.  2.10pm: Humliating backtrack here: Gary Naylor was right about the steeplechase. He usually is right. The athletics took its name from the horse race, where the horses were jumping over walls and creeks and not brave athletes named after towns in Lancashire. Sorry Gary. Back to the action, Great Britain are playing South Africa in the hockey and David Davies has made it to the final of the 1,500m freestyle. Grant Hacket, going for his third gold in a row in this event, broke the Olympic record in qualifying fastest.  2.18pm: I&apos;ve had a quick scout around for the latest hockey tables but can&apos;t seem to find them, although I remember that Great Britain essentially need to win all their remaining games to have a chance of going through to the medal play-offs. It&apos;s 0-0 with 21 minutes left in the first half.  2.21pm: Lu Yong wins China&apos;s eighth weightlifting gold medal, and the world record to boot. Andrei Rybakou, of Belarus lifted the same weight in the men&apos;s 85-kg class, which was a world record, but Lu weighs less and so took the gold.  2.27pm: Excellent goal for Great Britain in the hockey, courtesy of James Tindall. A South African player totally missed an attempted interception of a pass in the middle of the pitch and Tindall was clean through on goal. The keeper advanced, but Tindall casually lifted it over him and into the net. Team GB lead 1-0.  2.36pm: Quick round-up: Team GB&apos;s Paul Goodison is joint leader in the men&apos;s laser (that&apos;s sailing, by the way.) He won race four, and the current top three are: 1. Paul Goodison (Britain) 33, 2. Rasmus Myrgren (Sweden) 33, 3. Igor Lisovenko (Russia) 37. Penny Clark wasn&apos;t quite so good in the women&apos;s race and finished 10th in the fourth radial. Japan lead China 1-0 in the first-half of the women&apos;s football semi-final, where the winners play Brazil. Jelena Jankovic is 4-2 down to Dinara Safina in the tennis semi-final. The British women&apos;s 100m medley team are into the final, qualifying second fastest behind the Australians, as are the men, who qualified fifth fastest, behind, well, just behind.  2.38pm: The 200m is the final event today in the heptathlon, and Kelly Sotherton, lying fifth overall, is in lane three in heat two. She&apos;ll be off momentarily.  2.40pm Excellent run for Sotherton, who finishes second in her heat in a time of 23.39, which is her personal best. That means 1,040 points, but what that means to the overall standings remains to be seen. Sotherton had a decent day on the track, but blew it in the high jump and shot put. &quot;I&apos;m gutted,&quot; said Sotherton, using the buzz word of Team GB! GB! GB! today.  2.44pm: Natalia Dobrynska, of Ukraine, wins her heat of the heptathlon 200m and does so wearing a &quot;leader&quot; badge, a new innovation here that is kind of like the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. GB&apos;s Julie Hollman is back in seventh or eighth. Full standings at the end of the first day to follow.  2.47pm: Britain&apos;s top discus thrower, Philippa Roles, just misses out on a place in the final. She wangs it 57.44m, but it&apos;s not far enough and she ends 16th. The men&apos;s shot put final is underway, at the same time as the final heat of the 200m of the heptathlon. After that, we should have the overall standings that will show us where Sotherton is.  2.53pm: Dinara Safina has just successfully served for the match against Jelena Jankovic and goes through to the semi-final. Contrary to previous reports, that was the quarter-final and she&apos;ll now play China&apos;s Li Na in the semi. There are three Russians already in the semis, but Jankovic, the world No1 is out.  2.54pm: Tom Bryant is coming in for the coming ten minutes or so, and I&apos;ll leave you with news that Kelly Sotherton is up to third in the heptathlon rankings at the end of the first day. Hyleas Fountain leads with 4060, Natalia Dobrynska is second with 3996 and Sotherton third with 3938, but probably won&apos;t be happy after a couple of poor events. Anyway, here&apos;s Tom.  3pm: The men are still doing their thing with their sticks in the hockey and they&apos;re still 1-0 up against the South Africans, so jolly good for them. On the track, meanwhile, they&apos;re lining up for the men&apos;s 400m hurdles heat - which has always struck me as a particularly tricky race to run.  3.04pm: The favourite Bershawn Jackson wins it in 49.20 but, even better is the bloke who comes in last. Not sure who he is yet but he came in what must have felt like three days behind the winner. Brilliant stuff, that&apos;s what all that training was for. Ah - it was Harouna Garba from Nigeria. See ya!  3.08pm: Over in the shot put, it looks like a ZZ Top roadie&apos;s convention as a succession of bearded, muscle-bound men compete in what I&apos;d argue is one of the more bizarre track and field events. I can see the point, in an evolutionary sense, of virtually everything else - the javelin was useful for hunting, the running useful for chasing or being chased, the long-jump useful for jumping over things etc. However the point of hurling a large ball as fas as possible? It eludes me. Same for the discus, obviously.  3.11pm:Just past halftime in the big women&apos;s football semi-final grudge match* between China and Japan, the Japanese are winning 1-0. Currently there are a lot of people lying flat on their backs looking winded.  * May not actually be a grudge match, reporter groundlessly basing comments on the fact that the two countries are quite close to each other and very little else.  3.13pm: And with after fact-less reporting, I&apos;ll let Howard take back over.  3.15pm: &quot;We are up here TV-less and PC-less, and the New York Times site says Germany has eight golds so far (with no detail), while the Guardian site sticks to 7. Which is right?&quot; pleads Amy Hordes. Well, last week the NY Times apparently printed a correction from an article written in the mid 1960s, and are the noted arbiters of journalistic accuracy worldwide. I previously not only quoted from Wikipedia, but actually misapplied that baseless &quot;fact&quot;. You take a guess.  3.20pm: Somewhere at the Greatest Show on Earth, Rafael Nadal, arguably the greatest athlete in the world at the moment (Usain Bolt possibly excepted) is playing Novak Djokovic, arguably the greatest Serbian tennis player/impressionist combo in the world. But I can&apos;t find any evidence of it on the gogglebox on even the various internet streams, so can&apos;t really tell you anything about it. But The Polish ZZ Top roadie has won the shot put, it seems.  3.24pm: Roger Cook has the investigative nose of his journalistic namesake: &quot;If Amy Hordes is TV-less and PC-less, how does she know what the NYT site says (or the Guardian for that matter) and how is she emailing you?&quot; Good questions, and I&apos;ll send the intern to the telex machine straight away to pick up her answer. That Polish shot putter is named Tomasz Majewsky, by the way, and he&apos;s taken gold ahead of the American Christian Cantwell.  3.29pm: Great Britain have beaten South Africa 2-0 in the men&apos;s hockey and stay in with a chance of qualification for the medal matches. It&apos;s a fairly big ask - they&apos;ll have to beat Australia - but Matt Daley&apos;s late goal, added to James Tindall&apos;s first-half strike, give them a crucial victory in this match.  3.32pm: You leave Tom Bryant in charge of a MBM for ten minutes and he starts a diplomatic incident. Regarding his &quot;throwaway&quot; comment that the China-Japan football match might be a grudge match, we have opened up a huge can of military worms: &quot;Yes, China v Japan most certainly is a grudge match, given added spice by the fact that today is the anniversary of Japan&apos;s defeat in WWII,&quot; explains John Senior. &quot;The Chinese, as usual, are playing what might be politely described as a robust physical game. Hopefully their fans won&apos;t follow suit and pelt the Japanese embassy with eggs and stones, like at the Asian Cup a few years ago.&quot;  3.35pm: The line-up for the semi-finals of the men&apos;s 400m hurdles have been decided and there are no members of Team GB! GB! GB! in them, so we can happily pretend the event doesn&apos;t exist. &quot;Yep, grudge match seems fair given Manchuria, Nanking, Japan&apos;s continued inability to apologise for war crimes and Chinese support for North Korea and its missile testing in the area,&quot; intones Anthony O&apos;Keefe.  3.39pm: Ker-rash goes my computer. &quot;I&apos;m watching the tennis live on Malaysian TV in Kuala Lumpur,&quot; writess Simon Price. &quot;Nadal has just broken forthree two in the first set.&quot; Ta.  3.46pm: Simon Price&apos;s email footer claims he&apos;s an executive director of a building communications company in Kuala Lumpur. But today he&apos;s moonlighting as a MBM correspondent, watching the tennis: &quot;Djokovic double faults to go 5:2 down. Nadal serving for the first set. He&apos;s killing him.&quot;  3.47pm Meanwhile, John Senior is watching the football, so I don&apos;t have to: &quot;Excellent second goal by Japan. A neat one-two through a crowd on the edge of the box left several Chinese defenders sprawled in a heap asthe ball was slotted past the keeper. They&apos;ll be boarding up thewindows at the Japanese embassy in Beijing about now, I should think.&quot; A joke too. I never realised how easy this could be. Anyone watching the weightlifting?  3.48pm: Joe Milton is concerned for our well-being: &quot;Are you continuing the MBM over the weekend?&quot; he asks. &quot;If so are feeling slightly bitter about it being that hardly anyone will be at work and therefore will be watching on TV or using websites instead of following your commentary?&quot; Yep, there&apos;ll still be full text commentary - in for a penny, etc. But on your second point, you&apos;d be amazed. There are some folk who read this while they&apos;re also watching it on TV. Lord knows why, but it&apos;s true. Anyway, the women&apos;s 10,000m final is underway in the Bird&apos;s Nest.  3.52pm: And finally the tennis appears on my screen, so Simon Price, you can now go to bed if you want to. Djokovic broke back against Nadal, but the Spaniard is still serving for the set at 5-4.  3.55pm This straight from the news-wires: Women&apos;s doubles Final: 1 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 2 Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), 3 DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), 4 Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Tania Luiz &amp; Eugenia Tanaka (Aus), DU Jing &amp; Wei Yili &amp; Yang Wei &amp; Yu Yang &amp; Zhang Jiewen &amp; Zhang Yawen (Chn), Wen-Hsing Cheng &amp; Yu-Chin Chien (Tpe), Kamilla Rytter Juhl &amp; Lena Frier Kristiansen (Den), Gail Emms &amp; Donna Kellogg (Gbr), Liliyana &amp; Vita Marissa (Ina), Miyuki Maeda &amp; Kumiko Ogura &amp; Reiko Shiota &amp; Satoko Suetsuna (Jpn), Jungeun Ha &amp; Minjung Kim &amp; Hyojung Lee &amp; Kyungwon Lee (Kor), Eei Hui Chin &amp; Pei Tty Wong (Mal), Chantal Botts &amp; Michelle Edwards (Rsa), Yanmei Jiang &amp; Yujia Li (Sin), Eva Lee &amp; Mesinee Mangkalakiri (USA)  3.56pm Nadal wins the first set 6-4. That garbled stuff below was my attempt to find out who won the women&apos;s doubles badminton, and I think this says it better: DU &amp; Yu (Chn) bt Lee &amp; Lee (Kor) 2-0; (21-15), (21-13) , so that&apos;s another gold for the home nation.  3.59pm: &quot;There&apos;s a &apos;Racket of God&apos; controversy brewing in the tennis,&quot; says Kevin Davies, and he&apos;s right, although he&apos;s maybe overstating it. &quot;Near the end of the Blake-Gonzalez match, NBC showed Blake losing a critical point after his shot fell out. It clearly grazed Gonzalez&apos; racket, but the Chilean didn&apos;t acknowledge the touch. Blake tried showing restraint but bemoaned lack of Olympic spirit in the press conference.&quot; The TV commentators are on about this as well at the moment. Apparently Gonzalez should have called the foul on himself, but didn&apos;t, and Blake didn&apos;t win another game after the incident. This should give the noted moodster Blake something to whinge about for the coming few months.  4.02pm: They&apos;re 14 minutes into the women&apos;s 10,000m, and GB&apos;s Jo Pavey is in about 16th place and &quot;running very wisely&quot; according to Brendon Foster. Holland&apos;s Lornah Kiplagat is out front.  4.09pm: Kiplagat still leads with 11 laps to go, with Mestawet Tufa, of Ethiopia, second. Jo Pavey is beginning to struggle, especially compared with the casualness of the leaders. Pavey is out of the leading group now and is going to find it hard to get back into this.  4.12pm: Elvan Abeylegesse, of Turkey, is the new, mightily inconvenient leader for anyone typing this up. Tirunesh Dibaba, from Ethiopia, is second and Britain&apos;s Jo Pavey has fallen off the back of the earth.  4.16pm: Abeylegesse still leads a strung-out group five, from Dibaba. Dibaba remains an Ethiopian, the nation that Abeylegasse left for Turkey. And it&apos;s definitely just between these two now as they move well clear of the rest of the field. Jo Pavey has now slipped off of even Brendan Foster&apos;s radar.  4.20pm: Novak Djokovic has broken Nadal in the second set of the men&apos;s semi-finals and leads 3-1. Abeylgesse and Dibaba are still going this alone, with both looking totally at ease, but Dibaba sitting threateningly on Abeylgesse&apos;s shoulder. Shalane Flanagan has moved into third spot for the United States.  4.22pm: That&apos;s how you win a 10,000m race. At the bell, Tirunesh Dibaba explodes past Abeylgesse and flies into the lead. She sprints for the final 400m at a phenomenal rate and no one can get close. Abeylgesse keeps second and Flanagan takes third for the United States. &quot;That&apos;s not the result she would have wanted,&quot; says Steve Cram in the commentary box, as Jo Pavey comes in 412th from a field of 32. Dibaba&apos;s time was 29:54.68, which is one of the fastest times ever, despite smog, heat, etc., and so forth.  4.26pm: Novak Djokovic leads 4-1 in the second set, but is one set down to Rafael Nadal. I&apos;m busily trying to find someone to take over this to see you to the end of the tennis.  4.28pm: With a repeated punch to his own chest, Novak Djokovic breaks Nadal again to lead 5-1 in the second set. Looks like this one&apos;s going to a decider. Meanwhile, Jo Pavey asks &quot;What can you do?&quot; in her post-race interview and Kate Reed, whose was running in her first ever 10,000m final and didn&apos;t even appear in the commentary until it was done, also has a brief, sweaty chat. Not the results the British athletes will have been looking for, but a decent race nonetheless.  4.33pm: OK, Pavey actually finished in 12th spot and Kate Reed 23rd. Djokovic levels the tennis and that goes to a decider, while Caroline Kluft doesn&apos;t qualify for the triple jump final. That&apos;s it from me. I&apos;m off, but a full report from the tennis will follow. Full coverage continues over the weekend. Thanks for your emails. Bye."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/aug/15/htcsdreamgooglephoneexpecte", "publicationDate": "2008-08-15T11:28:25Z", "tags": ["Mobile phones", "Computing", "Technology", "Android"], "sentences": ["HTC, which is based in Taiwan, also declined to comment, although executives there have said they expected to deliver their phone by the end of the year."], "title": "HTC's Dream googlephone expected before Christmas", "article": "     The gPhone thing seems to have been going forever, but a fuzzy YouTube video that claims to show the HTC &quot;Dream&quot; mobile phone appeared recently, and now The New York Times says it should be out by Christmas -- possibly as early as October.  The phone&apos;s release date depends on how soon the Federal Communications Commission certifies that the Google software and the HTC phone meet network standards. Executives at all three companies are hoping to announce the phone in September because they would benefit from holiday season sales. The people briefed on the discussions declined to be named because they were not authorized to discuss the project.    Later, the NYT says:  Executives for T-Mobile, the nation&apos;s No 4 wireless carrier, declined to comment on the new phone except to say it was on track to offer it in the fourth quarter. HTC, which is based in Taiwan, also declined to comment, although executives there have said they expected to deliver their phone by the end of the year.    The New York Times doesn&apos;t say this, but it looks like bad news for Microsoft. HTC got to be very big very quickly by building its business on manufacturing PocketPC devices (such as the Compaq iPaq) and Windows Mobile phones, which are sold under a wide range of brand names. If HTC swaps Google Android software for Windows Mobile, Microsoft&apos;s share of the smart phone market could fall through the floor. Of course, HTC isn&apos;t the only company shipping Windows Mobile phones. However, it&apos;s the main avenue into the mass market, as opposed to targeting the business sector."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/16/olympics2008.olympicsaquatics1", "publicationDate": "2008-08-16T00:26:00Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Olympics 2008: Aquatics", "Sport", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["\u2022Fact No1: The United States have whupped Taiwan 7-0 in a rounders preliminary.\u2022Fact No2: Holland have crushed Australia 2-1 in the women&apos;s hockey."], "title": "Olympics: day eight - as it happened", "article": " Patrick will be here with regular updates from 1.55am.  We&apos;ll take you all the way through day eight of the Beijing Games.  1.56am: Morning everyone, hope you&apos;re all feeling as bright and fresh as I am! I&apos;ll be your guide for the next six hours, so contact me with any of your views, gripes and/or general mutterings.  2.00am: The sporting powers that be have decided to name today Super Saturday  and what better event to kick it off, than the men&apos;s 20km walk. Brilliant.  2.02am:  Aside from the walking, there&apos;s a whole host of things to get excited about. Michael &quot;half man half fish&quot; Phelps goes for his seventh gold medal in the 100m butterfly, Rebecca Addlington goes for an almost-as-impressive second gold in the 800m freestyle and we get our first chance to see our women&apos;s 400m duo of Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders.  2.12am: Weather Things are looking pretty clear in the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium, as they are in Hong Kong for the equestrian. In Qingdao, where they had a problem with a lack of wind yesterday, the weather is expected to be overcast for the sailing.  2.17am: Drama in the 20km walk, the Kazakhstani race leader has been warned.  2.23am: Ahh the first email of the morning. Pete Thomas wonders: &quot;Will this Milorad Cavic or a rejuvenated Ian Crocker prove to be the swimmer that broke the fish&apos;s back, so to speak?&quot;If I was a betting man, I&apos;d still go for Phelps, but I reckon it&apos;s going to be mighty close.  2.29am: Men&apos;s 3000m steeplechaseBouabdallah Tahri won an action-packed first heat, which saw the Italian athlete Matteo Villani spectacularly crash out. Villani looked very cheesed off.  2.36am: Men&apos;s 3000m steeplechase American Anthony Famiglietti has gone out like a rocket. He&apos;s way in out front of the rest. Only time will tell if it was a sensible move.  2.40am: Well done Anthony Famiglietti&apos;s, his hero move paid off. But sadly GB&apos;s Andrew Lemoncello won&apos;t make it to the next round.  2.47am: Andrew Jolley&apos;s back again with his super-duper-spreadsheet. The top three in our &apos;alternative&apos; medal table (proportion of medals to population) are Slovakia, closely followed by Armenia then Mongolia.  2.53: Colin Jackson gives Andrew Lemoncello a ticking off for his lacklustre performance. A little harsh perhaps.  2.59am:  Rishi&apos;s already talking about making Rebecca Adlington a dame, steady on, she hasn&apos;t even won her second gold medal yet.  3.04am: Women&apos;s 200m backstroke final Well done Kirsty Coventry, she&apos;s finally got a gold. And a world record to boot. Elizabeth Simmonds was sixth in a new British record time.  3.08am: Phelps has six, can he step-up to get his seventh. It&apos;s going to be tight.  3.12am: Men&apos;s 100m butterfly Phelps gets it. Just. What a finish. My hands are shaking. Cavic threw it away, he had it all wrapped up.  3.13am: Women&apos;s 800m freestyle This is it Dame Rebecca Adlington going for her second gold medal. Can she do it again?  3.18am:  Mansfield&apos;s finest has made a good start, she&apos;s level with the Romanian, Potec. And both are way in front of the world record line.  3.20am: Michael Phelps I still can&apos;t believe that man. Seven gold medals and a world record.  3.22am: GOLD Rebecca Adlington has absolutely destroyed the field to win her second gold medal. She&apos;s also beaten Janet Evans&apos; longstanding world record by over TWO SECONDS. What an amazing amazing swim.  3.25am: Unluckily for Brits in America NBC switched to a commercial break in the middle of the women&apos;s 800m freestyle.  3.28am: This is what the Olympics are about tears and gold medals. The BBC commentary team are overwhelmed.  3.32am: Phew. Time to catch my breath and give you some hockey results. The US women beat the Kiwis 4-1.  3.34am:  Valeriy Borchin has shuffled his way to the gold medal in the men&apos;s 20km walk. He looks suitably sweaty.  3.36am: Heptathlon Not a great jump for Kelly Sotherton, 6.21m, some way down on her personal best.  3.38am: Men&apos;s 50m freestyle final Cielo Filho has produced a bit of an upset to claim the gold medal. He&apos;s understandably elated, splashing water all over the place.  3.45am: Plenty of emails in support of Rebecca Adlington. Ben Tymens hates swimming and he even stayed up to watch it.  3.47am: Cesar Cielo Filho&apos;s achievement shouldn&apos;t be underrated, the man beat Alain Bernard of France, the 100m freestyle champion, world champion Ben Wildman-Tobriner of the United States and Aussie Eamon Sullivan, the world record-holder. What a swim.  3.55am: Women&apos;s 100m Superb run from Jeanette Kwakye she finished second in her heat and qualifies for the next round.  3.58am: The sprinter from Grenada isn&apos;t very happy. She&apos;s fidgeting like a stroppy toddler. It&apos;s only the Olympics calm down!  4.01am: Women&apos;s 100m Lauryn Williams eases through the heat.  4.05am: There she is, our new sporting hero Rebecca Adlington. She stands there proud as punch. Everyone who&apos;s up at this crazy hour, sing with me.....&quot;God save our gracious........................&quot;  4.11am: After Kirsty Coventry won three medals in Athens a number of Zimbabwean babies were called Kirsty, with the middle name Coventry, to honour he achievement. I wonder if they&apos;ll be a glut of Adlington&apos;s at Mansfield District Hospital.  4.19am: Something I forgot to mention, Iraqi athlete Dana Abdulrazak finished sixth in her 100m heat. The Iraqis almost didn&apos;t make it so it&apos;s great to see her competing.  4.25am:  Women&apos;s 100m Disappointment. Laura Turner finishes fourth in her heat. She&apos;ll have to wait to see if shes a fastest loser. Crammy said she should have done better.  4.29am: It&apos;s not looking good for our Kelly. All her competitors are cranking out PBs and she&apos;s treading water. 6.33m in the long jump isn&apos;t great at this stage.  4.33am: Montell Douglas is the second British female sprinter definietly through. She looked very nervous, but she&apos;s through, and that&apos;s the important thing.  4.38am: BREAKING NEWS Serbia have launched an official protest over the result of the men&apos;s 100m butterfly. Michael Phelps&apos; seventh gold medal is now in a bit of doubt. &quot;We have made an official protest. It&apos;s first place, it is very important,&quot; Serbia&apos;s deputy chef de mission Branislav Jevtic told Reuters. Watch this space for more news......  4.47am: Another lacklustre jump from Sotherton, she now lies fifth and surely a medal is now out of reach.  4.50am: More breaking news. No wind at the sailing venue, so the medals may get delayed until tomorrow. That ruins my chances of commentating on a Ben Ainslie triumph.  4.55am: Laura Turner is out. She won&apos;t go through as a fastest loser.  5.01am: OK we can all calm down now, Serbia&apos;s appeal over Michael Phelp&apos;s 100m Butterfly has been denied by FINA. According to Jim Graham, NBC had covered the protest about an hour ago. OK thats USA 1 GB 0.  5.08am:  Swimming &quot;It was very clear there was no doubt whatsoever that first arrival was Michael Phelps,&quot; FINA executive director Cornel Marculescu told reporters after a review of the race, which the American won by 0.01 second.&quot;The Serbs were satisfied and agree with the comments of the referee.&quot;  5.09am: Women&apos;s 400m The heats are about to get underway. Both Christine Ohuruogu and Nicola Sanders are in with a chance of a medal.  5.13am: Women&apos;s 400m Potential shock. Deedee Trotter ambled round the track, eventually finishing fourth. She may sneak through as a fastest loser.  5.19am: Badminton Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia beat Lu Lan of China 11-21 21-13 21-15  5.21am: More bad news for China, Zhang Penghui has been disqualified from the Olympic men&apos;s 25m rapid fire pistol competition. The reason: he raised his arm to much on three occasions.  5.27am: Women&apos;s 400m Lee McConnell qualifies for the next round. She made it look very easy, a nice relaxed run.  5.28am: Elena Isinbaeva makes Pole Vaulting look so easy; I&apos;m even thinking about limbering up for London 2012. Meanwhile, Kate Dennison wasn&apos;t so impressive she failed to get over 4.50m, but that&apos;s her best outdoors this season.  5.32am: Women&apos;s 400m Christine Ohuruogu ran-down Yulia Gushchina to win her heat very easily.  5.35am: I need some verification on a bit of pub quiz trivia. Is it true that the discus is the only event where the women&apos;s world record is better than the men&apos;s? Answers on a postcard please.....  5.40am: You know I mentioned the men&apos;s 25m rapid fire pistol well it&apos;s been won by Oleksandr Petriv (Ukraine) who scored 780.2 points.  5.42am: Sanya Richards is looking in ominous form. Don&apos;t forget she missed the World Championships last year. She made that race look like a gentle jog around Finsbury Park. No problems for Nicola Sanders either. Job done for the GB girls.  5.49am: So my discus factoid is half true. Jim Graham says: &quot;The women&apos;s discuss is 1 kilo, compared to the men&apos;s, which is 2 kilos. The men&apos;s discuss is also bigger in circumference. So, the records really have no relation to one another.&quot;  5.53am: I can&apos;t believe it, with all the excitement in the pool and on the track I&apos;ve totally forgotten about the softball. Japan v China and USA v Chinese Taipei. What the heck has happened? Also if anyone is watching any of the so-called &quot;smaller sports&quot; that the Beeb deems not worthy of coverage let me know.  6.00am:  It&apos;s been a big big morning. Here&apos;s what you missed out on. Brilliant Adlington wins second gold, Phelps wins seventh gold of the Beijing Games... just, Sotherton falls to fifth after failing to take off in the long jump, British trio cruise through 400m opening round and the &apos;Affectionate gesture&apos; that sparked a global storm.  6.08am:  Our friend Andrew Jolley has come up with the goods again. Apparently Japan are beating China 3-0 in the softball and, for good measure, he&apos;s thrown in a volleyball score, Serbia are one set up and are also leading Germany 10-6 in the second.  6.14am: Softball update, Jim Graham says the USA are now 5-0 up against Chinese Taipei.  6.27am: Andrew Jolley says: &quot;Japan did beat China in the softball 3-0, and Serbia have just taken the second set 27-25 against Germany in the best of 3 contest. It being 20 degrees in the middle of winter here in Brisbane, I&apos;m off to get an ice-cream.&quot;I want some ice-cream, although i&apos;d probably settle for coffee and toast.  6.30am: We&apos;re all missing a trick here, everyone one of us should have tuned in the trampolining. I didn&apos;t even realise it was an Olympic event. Apparently the athletes were stunned by the size of the crowd: &quot;We don&apos;t get anything like this at home,&quot; said Canada&apos;s Rosannagh MacLennan.  6.35am: If beeb commentator Andy Jameson had his way, instead of shaking hands, we&apos;d all go around saluting each other. I lost count of the times he demanded we all raise three fingers to our cranium during Rebecca Adlington&apos;s gold medal swim.  6.38am: Never accuse me of not having my finger on the Olympic pulse. Australia have just beaten European Champions Russia in the men&apos;s basketball. The Russians could possibly be heading out of the competition. Bit of a shock. (Thanks Joanna).  6.46am:  Bit of Brit interest for all flyweight Khalid Yafai takes on Andris Hernandez Laffita. Guess where he&apos;s from: Cuba. Oh dear that means he&apos;s bound to be good.  6.49am:  News from water polo. Germany have edged past Italy 8-7 and the USA have beaten Croatia 7-5. Did anybody watch? Were they good, bad or indifferent?  6.54am:  Andrew Jolley knows the Guardian website better than me, he&apos;s just pointed out this excellent guide to trampolining.  6.59am:  BoxingKhalid Yafai is getting a bit of a boxing lesson at the hands of the Cuban. How do they keep turning out such great fighters? Castro must be putting something in the water.  7.01am: Boxing Khalid Yafai has been beaten 9-3 by Andris Hernandez Laffita, another one of our boxers bites the dust.  7.02am: Today isn&apos;t just Super Saturday at the Olympics, it&apos;s also the start of the Premiership season, and on that note, David Bartram says: &quot;Thank god the Premier League starts today. I&apos;ve had enough of watching sportsmen from obscure nations outshining Brits. Oh wait...&quot;  7.07am: Shooting Bad news for anyone thing of taking up the 25-meter rapid-fire pistol for London 2012. Silver medalist Ralf Schumann won&apos;t be retiring any time soon. &quot;I will go to London (for the 2012 Olympics),&quot; he said. Schumann finished second behind Oleksandr Petriv of Ukraine.  7.12am: Injury update Germany defender Linda Bresonik is out of the Olympics after she tore an ankle ligament in the team&apos;s quarterfinal victory over Norway.  7.15am: Basketball Poor old Angola, Ioannis Bourousis scored 22 points as Greece thrashed them 102-61. They look to be on their way out.  7.20am: Another Chinese gold medal Defending champion Zhang Ning of China won the gold medal in women&apos;s singles in the Olympic badminton tournament Saturday, defeating team-mate Xie Xingfang in three sets. She won 21-12, 10-21, 21-18.  7.26am: Right that&apos;s me checking out of this mad house. Paolo Bandini is going to take you through the next few hours of action that will include: sailing, rowing and possibly some tennis. Right adios.  7.33am: Hello. I&apos;m watching a couple of very slow sailboats bobbing along gently on the water outside Qingdao. Ben Ainslie is apparently doing an &quot;excellent&quot; job of marking his only rival for the gold medal - America&apos;s Zach Railey. Which as far as I can discern means getting in Railey&apos;s way and copying absolutely everything he does. Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s going to be a problem, though it&apos;s early doors yet.  7.38am: Let&apos;s look at the agenda for the next few hours, then, and it seems like I may have arrived just in time for ... er ... a bit of a lull. Ainslie is going now, of course, but other than him, there&apos;s no British medal chasing till 8.50am BST, when Alan Campbell is in the final of the men&apos;s single sculls. Lots of rowing finals in quick succession after that though, with the women&apos;s pair, women&apos;s double sculls, men&apos;s double sculls and men&apos;s coxless four all to be decided. We&apos;ve also got James Degale up in the boxing at 9.15am, then the cycling gets going, with Chris Newton in the men&apos;s points race final at 10.40am and Bradley Wiggins chasing gold in the individual pursuit an hour and a quarter later.  7.44am: &quot;It&apos;s golden Saturday,&quot; yelps a slightly overexcited Clare Balding as Ainslie maintains his comfortable domination of America&apos;s Railey in the Finn Class sailing. In the meantime let me know which you are most excited about out of the men&apos;s basketball preliminary between Croatia and Lithuania, the men&apos;s handball preliminary between France and Spain or the men&apos;s table tennis semi-final between Japan and Germany and I&apos;ll try to give you some bonus updates*. * theguardian.com reserves the right to ignore your views.  7.51am: Gary Naylor&apos;s here, and he&apos;s quoting me. &quot;You say &apos;Ainslie needs to finish within six places of Railey to win gold, which doesn&apos;t look like it&apos;s going to be a problem&apos; (7.33am). Do you mean it will be &apos;plain sailing&apos;?&quot; You&apos;re better than that Gary.  7.55am: Am I the only one who&apos;s marginally uncomfortable about the BBC&apos;s repeated insistence on referring to this as a &quot;golden day&quot; for Britain? I mean I do realise that the one medal we&apos;ve won already is above par, and we probably will win a bunch more, but really - are we cocky enough about anything Olympic related to take winning medals for granted?  7.59am: &quot;Dramatic scenes!&quot; scream our commentary team as they cut to LIVE images of a small boat not moving. Apparently the Finn class medal race has been abandoned due to a lack of wind, meaning Ainslie, who basically had the gold in hand, now has to do it all over again. It could be later today, or it could be even later than that, depending on the weather.  8.03am: This really isn&apos;t what I was asking for (at 7.44am) but Andrew Jolly seems intent on doing my job for me. &quot;I can cover the Lithuania v Croatia basketball and Australia v Holland in the women&apos;s hockey as that&apos;s all there is on offer on Australian TV this afternoon,&quot; he chimes. &quot;It&apos;s 1-1 in the hockey at the start of the 2nd half and Croatia 23-17 Lithuania in the basketball.&quot;  8.11am: It&apos;s a Golden Day! Nobody&apos;s won anything in the last eight minutes, but let&apos;s be honest, I was wrong at 7.44am, it is a golden day for Britain. We&apos;ve been discussing this in the office, and we feel it may be necessary to play a little jingle every time Britain win gold. BBC&apos;s idents are already wearisome, while the national anthem and Spandau Ballet&apos;s Gold seem too obvious. Any other suggestions?  8.15am: &quot;I thought it was a golden day for Britain due to Hull City&apos;s first appearance in top flight football,&quot; pipes up Oliver Pattenden, moderately humorously.  8.18am: rowing More good news for Britain - there&apos;s a lurgy going round the rowing regatta, and among the afflicted is German rower Marco Neumann, who has been forced to withdraw from the final of the men&apos;s four. Given that they Germany were among the favourites, this can only mean more gold for Britain. Probably.  8.23am &quot;Yup, talking up the Golden Day can only end in tears,&quot; reckons Andrew Jolly. &quot;I know this because there have been a whole host of Australian swimmers who were meant to &apos;cruise home&apos; in gold. They&apos;ve been performing quite under par, which is of course, amusing, and provides me and others with much ammo for the office. They are of course, still miles ahead in the table.&quot; Pah - they&apos;re only one gold ahead. We&apos;ll be in front before elevenses ...  8.26am: sailing The guardian&apos;s man in Qingdao Steve Bierley says there&apos;s still some prospect of more wind later today, so there&apos;s a decent chance Ben Ainslie will get another shot at tying up his gold this afternoon.  8.31am: New Zealand-based British rowing enthusiast Joanne Harris has more good news for team GB ... &quot;TVNZ is also treating today as a possible golden day, because there&apos;s the rowing and the cycling and Valerie Vili appears to be on good form in the shot put,&quot; she says. &quot;Basically NZ is now desperate to get on the medals table full stop. But Mahe Drysdale&apos;s got a funny tummy and is dehydrated, so that might not help the chances and Vili&apos;s the best bet at the moment.&quot; Drysdale&apos;s got a dicky tummy too, eh? That pretty much guarantees Britain&apos;s Alan Campbell gold in the men&apos;s single sculls.  8.35am: &quot;But what happened in the trampolining,&quot; demands Frances Bentley. Britain&apos;s Claire Wright failed to qualify for the final of the women&apos;s competition, that&apos;s what.  8.42am: Enough dawdling, it&apos;s time for facts. \u2022Fact No1: The United States have whupped Taiwan 7-0 in a rounders preliminary.\u2022Fact No2: Holland have crushed Australia 2-1 in the women&apos;s hockey. &quot;Apparently it was the crowd&apos;s fault,&quot; relays Andrew Jolly.\u2022Fact No3: Rebecca Adlington is going to get an open-top bus tour around Mansfield to celebrate her two gold medals when she gets home. &quot;She has raised the profile of Mansfield and provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town,&quot; hurrahed the Mayor of Mansfield, Tony Egginton.\u2022Fact No4: You really should read Barney Ronay&apos;s blog asking whether we really need to learn lessons, because it&apos;s rather good.  8.48am: The men&apos;s single sculls is literally just 120 seconds away. I&apos;ve just been informed that Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird&apos;s Nest on all the big athletics - including the men&apos;s 100m final - from 1pm BST.  8.51am: Whinging ... erm ... Kiwis There&apos;s been a delay after Drysdale complained that there was weed in his lane and it had to be removed.  8.53am: Campbell&apos;s started well and is in the lead after 500m, Tim Meyens of Belgium is second ...  8.55am: ... Campbell&apos;s down to second after 1000m though - Olympic champion and favourite Olaf Tufte, from Norway, has taken first ...  8.57am: ... But it&apos;s Drysdale who leads after 1500m - he&apos;s setting a serious pace now and is almost a whole length clear of Tufte in second. Campbell is barely clinging onto third ...  8.58am: ... Yeah, Campbell&apos;s miles off the pace by the end and nowhere near the medals. His collapse was somewhat overshadowed by Drysdale, though, who seemed to go to pieces in the final 100m, when he went from leading comfortably to only just sneaking third. Tufte, who upped his stroke rate dramatically down the stretch, retains his Olympic title, while the Czech Republic&apos;s Ondrej Synek, who rowed a very patient race before also pushing on late, takes silver.  9.02am: skeet shooting In amidst all that rowing excitement, I&apos;m afraid I missed Vincent Hancock winning gold in the men&apos;s skeet shooting. Norway&apos;s Tore Brovold takes silver, and if I understand the official Beijing website right, then France&apos;s Anthony Terras got bronze.  9.05am: &quot;Lithuania beat Croatia 86-73,&quot; relays Andrew Jolly. &quot;I don&apos;t normally like basketball, but I&apos;ll concede that this was quite good. The water polo, on the other hand, is utterly ridiculous as a spectator sport, just a load of hairy men splashing and spluttering all over the place.&quot;  9.10am: &quot;Can we not be too hard on Alan Campbell,&quot; implores Joanne Harris as the women&apos;s pair get ready to go. &quot;He had a knee infection not that long ago and to reach the final was an achievement - also, Britain hasn&apos;t had a decent single sculler for quite some time, and Campbell&apos;s the baby of the men&apos;s singles field at the moment. He actually is a real prospect for 2012, as rowers can go on for some time (evidence: Steve Redgrave!)&quot; Indeed, quite an infection Joanne - he missed six weeks of training in the build-up to this Olympics. Joanne also rightly points out that Drysdale has had to receive treatment after collapsing in his boat.  9.12am: You were probably hoping for some more rowing news here, but you&apos;re getting sailing instead. Sadly both Ben Ainslie and the Yngling girls will now have to wait for tomorrow for their tilt at gold, as it&apos;s all been called off for the day due to adverse weather conditions. Sailing, incidentally, must be the only sport in the world where a total absence of wind constitutes &quot;adverse weather conditions&quot;.  9.15am: Britain&apos;s Louisa Reeve and Olivia Whitlam are pootling along in fifth at the half-way mark of the women&apos;s pair. To be fair they were never expected to do much here ...  9.20am: Reeve and Whitlam just about sneak past the support tugboat on the line, but only because it stopped. A comfortable last place for Britain, with Romania&apos;s Georgeta Andrunache and Viorica Susanu taking gold, and China&apos;s You Wu and Yulan Gao putting in a huge effort to power past Belarus&apos;s Yuliya Bichyk and Natallia Helakh for silver with less than 50m to go.  9.27am: Australia has beaten Russia 95-80 in the men&apos;s basketball. That&apos;s the sort of news you came here to hear.  9.30am: cycling Steven Burke is up against Ukraine&apos;s Volodymyr Dyudya in the first round of the men&apos;s individual pursuit ...  9.32am: cycling ... and so far he&apos;s getting hammered. Dyudya&apos;s about two and a half seconds ahead ...  9.34am: cycling ... but Burke comes storming back - the gap&apos;s down to just over 0.1sec with one lap to go ...  9.35am: cycling ... and Burke&apos;s through to the last four with what I&apos;m told is a personal best time. Brilliant stuff, and if Bradley Wiggins can do the same in his heat against Alexander Serov shortly, then Britain will be guaranteed at least one medal in the competition ...  9.39am: Debra Lee has composed a gold medal jingle to go with Team GB&apos;s golden day (number of gold medals won so far: 1). &quot;Bill Withers may be 80 but I&apos;m sure he&apos;s up for re-recording Lovely Day with revised lyrics,&quot; she offers - before launching into song: &quot;Then I check results and the world&apos;s alright with meJust who&apos;s won the gold, oh, I see it&apos;s Team GB -A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay(Golden day, golden day, golden day, golden)A golden daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay&quot;  9.42am: I&apos;ve just had a request for an update on that men&apos;s table tennis, and I can tell you that Germany are currently 2-1 up in matches against Japan, with Christian Suss beating Yo Kan 1-0 in games and 8-5 in the second game of the fourth match as I type.  9.47am: rowing Australia&apos;s Drew Ginn and Duncan Free have taken gold in the men&apos;s coxless pair. There were no Brits in the final, so no more crushing disappointment just yet.  9.47am: boxing James Degale is through to the quarter-finals of the men&apos;s middleweight tournament after beating USA&apos;s Shawn Estrada 11-5 on points. He&apos;ll face Kazakhstan&apos;s Bakhtiyar Artayev next.  9.52am: rowing And now we have Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington in the final of the women&apos;s double sculls. They&apos;re fourth and three seconds back on leaders Germany at the half-way mark. In fact they&apos;re apparently in &quot;fourth medal&quot; position according to the Beeb&apos;s commentators. What do we reckon that particular medal&apos;s made of, cheese (hard variety)?  9.57am: rowing ... the girls are still three seconds back but now third at the 1,500m mark ...  9.59am: rowing ... Aah - a frustrating bronze medal for Britain in the end - they battled right back into it, and had the race gone on another 50m probably would have won, but in the end were only about three feet back of Germany and New Zealand, who crossed the line at almost exactly the same moment. As yet we still don&apos;t know who actually won as it was too tight to call ...  10.01am: rowing New Zealand&apos;s Georgina and Caroline Evers-Swindell are deemed to have won by a hundredth of a second, meaning their first gold of the Games.  10.04am: cycling Meanwhile, Bradley Wiggins has beaten Serov in the individual pursuit. His time was the fastest in any of the four heats, so he will face New Zealand&apos;s Hayden Roulston, whose heat time was three seconds slower than his own, in the heats. Wiggins was 12-1 on favourite before this morning and he should fancy his chances now. Steven Burke&apos;s time was the third-fastest in the end, so he will face Russia&apos;s Alexei Markov in the bronze medal race.  10.06am: cycling Chris Hoy has cruised through his heat in the men&apos;s keirin.  10.10am: rowing We&apos;re back at the Shunyi rowing lake, where Matthew Wells and Stephen Rowbotham have a reasonable shot for gold in the men&apos;s double sculls  10.13am: rowing are second at the half-way mark, but Australia are pulling away and have already created clear water between themselves and the British crew ...  10.15am: rowing ... Australia&apos;s still have a gap of over two and a half seconds at 1,500m and I&apos;d the Brits are looking more likely to lose silver - probably to Estonia - than gain gold ...  10.17am: rowing ... They say second place is first loser, which would make our crew second losers, I guess, as they are overhauled by Estonia right on the line. Yup, the golden day is going much as we expected.  10.24am: &quot;So far the only golds the Aussies have won have been in the swimming and rowing,&quot; points out Bob O&apos;Hara. &quot;It&apos;s almost as if they&apos;re desperately trying to get off their large island ... I hope they don&apos;t discover sailing.&quot; Meanwhile Britain&apos;s Ross Edgar has qualified from his heat in the men&apos;s keirin.  10.30am: &quot;Bolt&apos;s going to run 9.5sec today,&quot; insists my colleague James Dart and 100m chitter-chatter has been dominating the desk all morning. Personally I still believe Tyrone Edgar&apos;s in with a shout*. * I do NOT believe this.  10.32am: rowing Right then, one last crack at gold on the Shunyi lake. Great Britain are second at the 500m mark in the men&apos;s fours ...  10.34am: rowing ... Team GB are third and about 1.4sec behind Australia at the half-way point. This is where Britain would expect to start kicking on ...  10.35am: rowing ... still second at the 1,500m mark but the gap isn&apos;t closing so far ...  10.37am: rowing GOLD FOR BRITAIN! Raise your glasses, do a dance, play a jingle - Debra Lee&apos;s at 9.39am will do - the golden day is finally back on as Tom James, Andy Hodge, Pete Reed and Steve Williams heave their way past the Australians with 100m to spare.  10.41am: rowing Take that Russia! A fifth gold medal elevates Britain in the table from lowly ninth to a lofty eighth, leaving the Russians trailing in their wake. &quot;What&apos;s impressive is how the rowing coaches ride bikes along the towpath to observe the crews,&quot; parps Gary Naylor,&quot; yet, despite being close together and staring at boats and stopwatches instead of the road ahead, never collide nor, alas, ride into the lake.&quot; Those riders came up last time I was on MBM duty too, and I think we established there are some fans in that mix too - apparently they&apos;ve been hiring out bikes for free by the rowing lake. Which I guess isn&apos;t so much hiring them out as giving them away, when you think about it.  10.48am How long does it take to give out a medal? Wells and Rowbotham are only just getting theirs, and they finished half an hour ago.  10.50am: cycling OK, maybe I can stop being facetious about the gold rush now - we&apos;ve got an all-British final coming up in the women&apos;s 3000m individual pursuit after Wendy Houvenaghel and Rebecca Romero posted the two fastest times in the heats.  10.58am: cycling A few of you have emailed in to express concerns over the moped that leads the cyclists out on the first few laps of the keirin. Gary Naylor reminds us of Alan Partridge&apos;s stringent views on this sort of cheating.  11.08am: cycling Right, we&apos;ve got the men&apos;s points race starting any moment now, where Britain&apos;s Chris Newton is up for a medal, but in the meantime I have huge news from the men&apos;s team table tennis, where Germany are through to the final after beating Japan 3-2. Judging by the footage on Eurosport, they&apos;re pretty happy about it too.  11.13am: Brazil just kicked off against Cameroon in the quarter-finals of the men&apos;s football and likewise Italy against Belgium. No goals in either as yet.  11.16am: cycling &quot;Good luck with the points race,&quot; offers Gary Naylor. &quot;I&apos;ve watched a lot of bike racing, but I still have no idea what&apos;s happening.&quot; Oh, it&apos;s perfectly straightforward Gary. Basically they all pedal round this here velodrome, and they get points for ... er ... yes. America&apos;s Bobby Lea just did a full lap more than everyone and rejoined the main group, and therefore has 25 points. Britain&apos;s Chris Newton has two. Just 133 laps to go.  11.21am: tennis The Williams sisters are a set down to the Ukraine&apos;s Bondarenko sisters in the women&apos;s doubles, but 4-2 up in the second set. Russia&apos;s Dinara Safina, meanwhile, has beaten China&apos;s Na Li in the women&apos;s singles, and will face compatriot Elena Dementieva, who beat another Russian - Vera Zvonareva - in the other semi-final.  11.28am: cycling Yup, just 100 laps to go in the points race and &quot;it&apos;s going to be very close&quot;. This seems as good a time as any to make my excuses and leave, so here&apos;s Taimour Lay to carry you through to 1pm, after which Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the Bird&apos;s Nest. Thanks for all your emails.  11.33am: Right, that&apos;s quite enough of Bandini&apos;s knee-jerk patriotism. Here&apos;s to an afternoon of British underachievement and detached cynicism. By the way, the men&apos;s points race is continuing on its merrily incomprehensible way. A shiny penny to anyone who emails in to explain the rules.  11.36am: Football Exciting things are happening in the quarter-final between Italy and Belgium. But I only know what John in Singapore tells me: &apos;&apos;It&apos;s now 1-1 with Belgium down to ten men after giving away a penalty. Italy scored to make it 1-0 but then belgium equalised with a very, very controversial header from a corner. It was cleared off the line but the ref said it went over. Very dodgy indeed.&apos;&apos; Back to the compelling cycling on the BBC! Only 60 laps to go...  11.39am: Roy Keane emails from New Zealand with a not unreasonable question which I, erm, can&apos;t answer. &apos;&apos;How does a rider end up in negative points in this men&apos;s points race?&apos;&apos; Anyone?  11.41am: Team GB Cycling Chris Newton is in a bronze medal position with 40-odd laps left. That much I know.  11.43am: Things coming up  Steven Burke is on next in the men&apos;s 4000m individual pursuit bronze medal race, with Bradley Wiggins in the gold race afterwards. The keirin second round, with Chris Hoy, is after the points race with the final at 12.20pm. The javelin round of the heptathlon starts at midday. Watch amazed as Kelly Sotherton sends the pointy stick backwards into the crowd.  11.45am:  The points race explained. Andrew Jolly wonders what all the fuss is about. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s pretty simple. There are a load of laps, every 10 laps there is a sprint, where they give 5 points for the bike across the line first, down to 1 for 5th. If you go all the way around and catch the back of the pack, you get 20 points. The bloke with the most points wins.&apos;&apos;  And, Roy, here&apos;s an answer to the negative points question. Again, from Mr Jolly. &apos;&apos;You get 20 points taken away if you drop a lap from the leaders.&apos;&apos; I feel pretty small right now. Meanwhile, Newton is in second! (check out that exclamation mark as my own knee-jerk patriotism kicks in.....)  11.49am: Football Football Football  Italy are getting STUFFED by Belgium. Well, not stuffed. But, read on: &apos;&apos;The Belgians are in dreamland according to the commentator,&apos;&apos; says John in Singapore. &apos;&apos;And why not? They&apos;ve just gone 2-1 up in injury time at the end of the first half. I won&apos;t pretend to know who scored, mind you.&apos;&apos; I have the full weight of the Guardian sports department behind me. I&apos;ll find that Belgian scorer.  11.50am: None of us know the scorer.  11.53am: Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the bird&apos;s nest in Beijing from 1pm: follow all the athletics, including the men&apos;s 100m at 3.30pm.  11.55am: Team GB Cycling Bronze to Chris Newton  Fair enough.  11.59am: Chinese Pop-aganda:  Want to hear the Olympic song that is sending Marina Hyde around the Beijing bend?  Well, I played it (for research purposes, you understand) before work this morning, fully prepared to reject its saccharine manipulation, but then ended up humming it all the way to Farringdon, a spring in my step, the Olympic spirit coursing through my veins. Try it if you dare.   12.01pm: &apos;&apos;The Belgian who scored was Kevin Mirallas!&apos;&apos; emails an excited Joanna Sutherland. We are a global village. And I am the idiot.  12.04pm: Team GB Keirin Chris Hoy is into the final.  12.07pm:  Andy Bull gets all voyeuristic at the rowing.  12.12pm: Sotherton watch Kelly starts her javelin. She&apos;s 22 points off bronze in the heptathlon. This is her worst event. And it&apos;s ... a no throw! At least, that&apos;s what I think a cross and a red flag indicate. Not a great beginning. Just hurl it! Any old way will do.  12.15pm: Another email from Joanna who obviously has a laptop and a budding ambition to take all our jobs: &apos;&apos;I&apos;m writing from the Basketball arena in Beijing and coming up next is China v Germany (whoever loses is out of the competition - the locals are VERY nervous) followed by USA (USA!) v world champions Spain. It&apos;s a biggie and the venue is full of bloody media!&apos;&apos;  12.17am: Team GB Keirin Ros Edgar makes the final too. Bandini can&apos;t control himself and bellows &apos;&apos;GB Gold rush!&apos;&apos; across the newsroom. Britain. Is. Great.  12.19am: Football Brazil v Cameroon. &apos;&apos;It&apos;s 0-0, nearly 60 minutes gone and it&apos;s not a great game,&apos;&apos; reports Andrew Jolly. And Cameroon are down to 10 men. &apos;&apos;Does anyone care about Italy v Belgium?&apos;&apos; asks Singapore John. &apos;&apos;If they do they might like to know Rossi, the fella that used to play for Man Utd, just got booked for diving in the box when the keeper clearly had enough of his ankle to make you think he was trying to rob his boots. I can imagine some serious whining from the Italians if they lose this.&apos;&apos; Some-time Italian Paolo Bandini applauds the dive: &apos;&apos;A pragmatic solution to a hopeless situation.&apos;&apos;  12.23pm: Team GB  Newton is on the podium for his bronze. Joan Llaneras of Spain got gold in that points race by the way.  12.25pm: Tennis Novak Djokovic has won the first set 6-3 against James Blake. The winner takes the bronze medal.  12.26pm: Sotherton throws a javelin! She made a celebratory gesture just now that suggests it went forwards - as is the aim of the discipline.  12.28pm: Team GB Cycling It&apos;s the individual men&apos;s pursuit. Stephen Burke is up against Alexei Markov of Russia for the bronze medal.  12.30pm: Team GB Burke  Markov is ahead. The 20 year-old from Lancashire needs to, er, pump those legs faster so that the bike moves quicker and so on.  12.32pm: Cycling  Burke is go! He&apos;s ahead. In her 800m semi-final, Marilyn Okoro finishes 6th. Will that be enough to qualify?  12.34pm: Bronze rush! Stephen Burke has won it. 4.20.947 is the time. And Bradley Wiggins is next in the gold medal race against the Kiwi Hayden Roulston. They&apos;re off.  12.40pm: Wiggins looks like he&apos;s going to win it. He&apos;s 2 seconds clear.  12.41pm: Team GB Gold Individual pursuit Belgian-born Wiggins is an Olympic winner once again.  12.43pm: Team GB Athletics Rush of disappointment In the women&apos;s 800m semis, it looks like Marilyn Okoro&apos;s 6th place won&apos;t be enough to qualify for the final. In the second heat, Jenny Meadows also came sixth.  12.45pm: Tennis In the battle of the siblings, Serena and Venus Williams are into the final of the women&apos;s doubles after beating Ukraine&apos;s Alona and Kateryna Bondarenko 4-6, 6-4, 6-1.  12.47pm: Egad, I wish I was watching the football John fills us in: &quot;The Italians win a second penalty and, against Belgian&apos;s substitutekeeper, it&apos;s......scored by Rossi. 2-2 with 20 minutes to go. The ten of Italy men will not lie down! But then shocking keeping lets Dan Welly, or whatever he&apos;s called, score his second and it&apos;s 3-2 to Belgium. And the ref has sent off the Italian keeper. Miralis, the Belgian striker, ran off with the ball and then threw it behind him right into the keeper&apos;s head (tough to tell if he meant it or not) at which point the Italian keeper wrestled him to the ground and saw red. 10 minutes to go and it&apos;s a blinder!&apos;&apos;  12.52pm: The obligatory softball update &apos;&apos;Having still not seen any of TEAM GBGBGB (say it fast enough and you get Bee Gees) in action in the velodrome courtesy of Australian State Television, I thought you might like to know the Aussie women&apos;s softball team have just beaten the Dutch.&apos;&apos; Thanks to Michelle Houtman, who claims to be &apos;&apos;suffering in Sydney&apos;&apos;. From excitement?  12.54pm:  Football  Jolly intriguing: Cameroon hang on for extra time with 10 men against Brazil.  12.57pm: The English Premier League begins - the world yawns? &apos;&apos;I was wondering if there was any indication of the Chinese organisers trying to overcome the fact that now the Premiership has started the Olympics will wither on the vine over here,&apos;&apos; writes Tom Stone. &apos;&apos;I am sure someone is still watching it but a quick walk down the street and a few cheeky glances into people&apos;s front rooms suggests that the majority of Brixton at least would rather watch Mark Lawrenson and Lee Dixon bickering over who will be relegated come May.&apos;&apos; I wouldn&apos;t attempt cheeky glances at strangers in Brixton, Tom. That&apos;s brought me a lot of trouble in the past...  1.00pm: Sotherton&apos;s vigorous celebrations just before were for a 37.66m effort - a modest throw but at least she didn&apos;t impale herself.  1.02pm: Team GB keirin Edgar and Hoy start the final. More medals up for grabs here.  1.04pm: GB GOLD A-HOY!  One lap to go. Hoy led from the front. Edgar sneaked through to third. And then second... And its gold to Hoy! My boss shouts &apos;&apos;Goldrush!&apos;&apos; Edgar takes silver! I feel moderately excited and I&apos;m not afraid to admit it.  1.10pm: And on that golden bombshell, that&apos;s it for this minute-by-minute report. But Lawrence Donegan is in Beijing - he&apos;s blogging on the athletics right now.  You can leave comments there, too. ps. Brazil are now 2-0 up in extra-time in their quarter-final against Cameroon. pps. Usain Bolt has just ambled/strolled/pretty much walked through his 100m semi in 9.85sec.  ppps.

In July 2007, Euromonitor tipped UK green tea sales to jump 61 per cent in the five years to 2011, to \u00a324.3m, even as black tea sales declined nearly 8 per cent to less than \u00a3600m.  The chief beneficiaries have been fast-growing tea traders and blenders - companies such as London-based Newby Teas, Jing Tea and Postcard Teas. They tend to be run by entrepreneurs who wouldn&apos;t be out of place on the clipper ships and trading routes of the 19th century. &apos;This new industry is being created by people with a real passion for tea, who have given up working as a teacher or a civil servant,&apos; says Jane Pettigrew, a leading authority and writer on the subject.  Fast-growing companies with chunky margins inevitably attract the attention of larger rivals, and niche British tea makers are increasingly being targeted by acquisition-hungry foreign companies, many from the Indian subcontinent.  This is not new, but the process is speeding up. India&apos;s mighty Tata Group started it, buying up Tetley in 2000 for \u00a3271m. Three years ago, Apeejay Surrendra group, also from India, bought Typhoo for \u00a380m. Earlier this year Tata was at it again, bidding \u00a330m for Clipper, a speciality producer of fairtrade and organic teas and coffees based in Dorset. Tata failed and Clipper, founded in 1984 by husband-and-wife team Michael and Lorraine Brehme, was sold to the financial firm Fleming Family and Partners. Tata was not the only Indian firm to throw its hat into the ring. Mumbai-based Sapat International lodged a \u00a324m bid for Clipper, which also fell short of the mark. But Sapat&apos;s owner, Nikhil Joshi, has not given up. He has a kitty of \u00a320m to spend on a British tea brand and told The Observer he has two companies in his sights: Whittard of Chelsea and Taylors of Harrogate.  What makes Sapat, founded 110 years ago by Nikhil&apos;s grandfather, RH Joshi, and with an annual turnover of over \u00a3100m, so desperate to make it in Britain? The answer is in the brand. Being seen as &apos;British&apos;, or, more specifically, &apos;English&apos; in the tea business is, if not a passport to success, then certainly an open ticket. Sapat may be one of the biggest growers, blenders and shippers in a country that exported 188,000 tonnes of tea in 2005, but its brand value overseas is nil.  &apos;If the product says &apos;Made in India&apos;, it won&apos;t make the right impression on the customer,&apos; says Joshi. &apos;If you go to the Russian market, for instance, a British label has more appeal. An English brand like Ahmad Tea or Newby Teas may grow their leaves in India, but they are packaged and sold to the Russians as an English brand.&apos; Hence the scramble to buy up a British tea brand before Tata and Unilever gobble them all up. Joshi may have to look farther than Newby or Ahmad, both of which profess their determination to remain independent. And while both are London-based firms, each is run by merchants with roots in Persia and India. Ahmad&apos;s name and brand was brought to London in the 1980s by three Iranian brothers, who re-exported the new, &apos;British&apos; product back to Tehran. Newby was founded in 2000 by a British Indian merchant, NK Sethia, who started his career - like Raschid Ismail - as a London tea taster and broker in the swinging Sixties.  Both companies have moved aggressively into the Russian market, which has fast become one of the biggest global buyers of high-quality leaf. According to the International Tea Committee, Russian imports of tea jumped from 111 million tonnes in 1996 to 170 million by 2005, with annual imports to the former Soviet bloc notably Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic states, up more than 25 per cent over the period, to 64 million tonnes. Both Newby and Ahmad make much of their adopted Englishness. Ahmad festoons its products with paintings heavy in English antiquity. &apos;We portray ourselves as a very English brand,&apos; says Ahmad&apos;s export manager, Justin Tate. &apos;We sell the romantic view of &apos;Britishness&apos; to foreigners - Buckingham Palace, royalty, and so on.&apos; Other companies go further, even when they are about as British as Stalin. Orimi Trade, based in St Petersburg in Russia, has adopted an English name - and website: Greenfieldtea.co.uk - to appear more Blighty and less Boris.  While some traders export a nostalgic vision of the Empire, others prefer to tempt Brits with high-end teas grown in the fields of the Far East. Take Postcard Teas, based on London&apos;s New Bond Street, a three-year-old company whose sales are doubling each year. Its founder, Timothy d&apos;Offay, spent nearly a decade exploring east Asia&apos;s best tea plantations.  His epiphany was that the finest teas from Korea, China, Japan and Taiwan could be enjoyed by British customers more used to a Tetley drawstring bag. He says the range of customers in his shop has caught him by surprise. &apos;There is a new batch of connoisseurs out there, particularly young men, who may not buy expensive wines, but who find a link with a terroir [the French designation for the characteristics of soil and climate that provide a wine with a specific taste or personality].&apos; Without the recent change in our drinking habits, many of these vibrant young trading firms would not exist. There would be no place in the Kentish town of Tunbridge Wells for Raschid Gibrail&apos;s new firm, Ismail Coffee and Tea. Reopened in 2007, it has proved a hit, and Gibrail&apos;s investors envisage opening up to 25 more Ismail-branded outlets around the country. The customers love it, says Gibrail: &apos;Tea is like wine 10 or 20 years ago - people were drinking it, but they didn&apos;t know what they were drinking. That has changed for the better, and the same thing is happening in the tea industry.&apos; Sales forecasts Black tea 2006 \u00a3644m 2011 \u00a3595m  Down 8% Green tea 2006 \u00a315.1m 2011  \u00a324.3m  Up 61% Fruit/herbal tea 2006 \u00a367.2m  2011 \u00a388.1m  Up 31% &apos;Other&apos; tea 2006 \u00a36m  2011 \u00a315m  Up 150% Source: Euromonitor International"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/georgia.china", "publicationDate": "2008-08-20T19:30:00Z", "tags": ["Georgia", "China", "Russia", "US news", "World news", "Taiwan", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China&apos;s relationship with Taiwan resembles Russia&apos;s ties to Georgia.", "The Caucuses conflict offers China a realistic model for what it can expect if it the Taiwan situation turns violent.", "Shift the focus to Taiwan, an island that China considers a renegade province, and the proposition seems equally ludicrous, while the scope for miscalculation appears similarly broad.", "America has been purposely vague about what it would do in the event of a mainland military threat to Taiwan and its 23 million people.", "A dozen years ago, China conducted missile tests in the Taiwan Strait ahead of Taiwan&apos;s first presidential election.", "Today Taiwan is a de facto separate country, while China claims it&apos;s still part of the nation.", "Keeping the peace relies on both governments preserving the status quo: China won&apos;t attempt reunification by force, and Taiwan won&apos;t move toward official independence.", "For example, China could decide that Taiwan&apos;s ambition to join the World Trade Organisation constitutes a move toward independence.", "When Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov urged the US to choose between &quot;support for a virtual project&quot; in Georgia and its &quot;real partnership&quot; with Russia on key issues such as nuclear negotiations with Iran and North Korea, he could have been China&apos;s foreign minister Yang Jiechi speaking about the US, China and Taiwan.", "It&apos;s hard to imagine that Taiwan would be allowed to interfere.", "For China, it&apos;s a reminder that assertiveness on Taiwan will trigger reactions from its neighbours.", "Additionally, other countries on its flanks, including Southeast Asia could be spooked by military action in Taiwan.", "The most hopeful sign of avoiding a replay of the Georgian war between China and Taiwan is warming cross-strait relations, particularly since Ma Ying-jeou took office as Taiwan&apos;s president in May.", "If Russia humiliates Georgia at little cost, it could inspire China to press Taiwan when the opportunity beckons.", "Taiwan&apos;s allies, like Georgia&apos;s, are eager to remain friends with the big player neighbour and not eager for a fight.", "If the current sunshine over the Taiwan Strait gives way to clouds, that could drive the little player to do something desperate, as Georgia did, before it loses whatever leverage it has, and China to take advantage of the opening.", "To avoid a replay, the US need to show Taiwan and China that it wants to be a dependable friend to each, but that friendship depends on following the rules.", "Otherwise, Taiwan will pay a far bigger one."], "title": "Muhammad Cohen: Georgian conflict may cause China to reevaluate relations with Taiwan", "article": "One extremely interested observer in the war between Russia and Georgia hasn&apos;t vocally taken sides in the conflict. Given the war&apos;s timing, you might call this country&apos;s interest \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 in the conflict &quot;sporting&quot;. But in reality, Georgia versus Russia provides a convenient simulation for this great power&apos;s options of dealing with the western backed irritant on its own perimeter. Beyond the combatants and other former Soviet Republics, no nation is more interested in the Russia-Georgia conflict&apos;s global fallout than China. China&apos;s relationship with Taiwan resembles Russia&apos;s ties to Georgia. In both situations, the big state feels a sense of grievance over the very existence of its puny neighbour and resents outsiders that act as its self-appointed protectors. The Caucuses conflict offers China a realistic model for what it can expect if it the Taiwan situation turns violent. The parallels aren&apos;t perfect, but there&apos;s a close enough fit for China to pay very close attention, particularly to the international consequences of Russia&apos;s humiliation of Georgia. With China watching, the US and it allies need to get their response to Russia absolutely right. The crisis may have its roots in a failure to communicate. Georgia and its president Mikheil Saakashvili may have grossly overestimated the west&apos;s commitment to defending its borders and interests. Saakashvili may have equated the west&apos;s promise of Nato membership with mutual defence benefits. Or, at least, Saakashvili may have believed that Russia believed the west would fight for Georgia. Although the US insists Georgia is still a candidate for Nato, it&apos;s now comedic or criminal to imagine putting a Georgian finger on the trigger to set American, British, French, German and other European troops firing on Russian forces.  Shift the focus to Taiwan, an island that China considers a renegade province, and the proposition seems equally ludicrous, while the scope for miscalculation appears similarly broad. America has been purposely vague about what it would do in the event of a mainland military threat to Taiwan and its 23 million people. A dozen years ago, China conducted missile tests in the Taiwan Strait ahead of Taiwan&apos;s first presidential election. As unbelievable as that seems, it&apos;s even more incredible to recall that the US sent an aircraft carrier group warning China to back off. Today Taiwan is a de facto separate country, while China claims it&apos;s still part of the nation. Keeping the peace relies on both governments preserving the status quo: China won&apos;t attempt reunification by force, and Taiwan won&apos;t move toward official independence. Within those rules, everyone trades and invests together peacefully. But rules are made to be broken, and even if nobody explicitly crosses the line, ticklish situations can arise. For example, China could decide that Taiwan&apos;s ambition to join the World Trade Organisation constitutes a move toward independence. When Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov urged the US to choose between &quot;support for a virtual project&quot; in Georgia and its &quot;real partnership&quot; with Russia on key issues such as nuclear negotiations with Iran and North Korea, he could have been China&apos;s foreign minister Yang Jiechi speaking about the US, China and Taiwan. The unprecedented turnout of world leaders for the Olympics in Beijing indicates that the global establishment desperately wants &quot;real partnership&quot; with China. It&apos;s hard to imagine that Taiwan would be allowed to interfere.  Deepened economic ties between the US, EU and China over the past decade mean all sides have more to lose in a conflict. While moving toward a consumer economy, China still remains heavily dependent on exports to developed countries. Developed economies depend on China for cheap goods to meet consumer demand while controlling inflation and maximising corporate profits. With bricks and mortar investment in the mainland, western companies would risk expropriation in the event of a crisis. China also holds trillions of dollars in US Treasury securities, which it could dump on the market to depress US bond prices and raise Uncle Sam&apos;s financing costs. A fire sale of Treasury notes would cost China dearly, so the holding acts as a sort of financial mutual suicide pact neither side wants to test. Russia&apos;s huge energy reserves may give it even greater economic leverage than China, especially over Europe. Therefore Russia may get off a little easier than China would for its military excesses. If the US and EU show spine despite this leverage, then China can expect to pay a bigger price. China will particularly be watching threats to punish Russia in international organisations and institutions, where China participates more deeply than Russia. While Russia hopes to join the WTO, China entered it in 2001, boosting foreign investment exponentially and making economic reform seem irreversible. Sanctions would be embarrassing, but also potentially harmful to investment and trade.  &quot;If Russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in Georgia, the US-Russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come,&quot; US defence secretary Robert Gates warned last Thursday. That&apos;s tough talk, but so far, there&apos;s only been talk and empty ceasefire proposals as Russia has advanced beyond disputed territory into Georgia proper. There&apos;s &quot;no prospect&quot; of US military intervention, Gates added emphatically. The Russians are writing the script here. The US and EU are in no position to edit it, and it would be hard for China not to notice.  Russia benefits because the US is involved in two wars already and has neither the troops nor the stomach for a third. China may be tempted to act soon, while US commitments and its need for China&apos;s help on North Korea and other issues are great. But the US can still muster more than blankets and cots in response to aggression. Today&apos;s signing of a US-Poland agreement on missile defence and mutual defence is a reminder that the US has some weapons to counter Russian ambitions. For China, it&apos;s a reminder that assertiveness on Taiwan will trigger reactions from its neighbours. The two biggest neighbours, US allies Japan and South Korea, have long histories of hostility toward China. Additionally, other countries on its flanks, including Southeast Asia could be spooked by military action in Taiwan. Imagine Vietnam reopening the naval base at Cam Rahn Bay to its old enemy the US in response to China&apos;s belligerence.  The most hopeful sign of avoiding a replay of the Georgian war between China and Taiwan is warming cross-strait relations, particularly since Ma Ying-jeou took office as Taiwan&apos;s president in May. The better the two sides get along, the less likely outsiders can tempt either side to throw a spanner into the works. The outcome in Georgia will illustrate the cost of miscalculation.  If Russia humiliates Georgia at little cost, it could inspire China to press Taiwan when the opportunity beckons. Taiwan&apos;s allies, like Georgia&apos;s, are eager to remain friends with the big player neighbour and not eager for a fight. If the current sunshine over the Taiwan Strait gives way to clouds, that could drive the little player to do something desperate, as Georgia did, before it loses whatever leverage it has, and China to take advantage of the opening. To avoid a replay, the US need to show Taiwan and China that it wants to be a dependable friend to each, but that friendship depends on following the rules. That means Russia and Georgia both have to pay a price for their misadventure in the Caucuses. Otherwise, Taiwan will pay a far bigger one."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/21/hacking.internet", "publicationDate": "2008-08-20T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Hacking", "Internet", "Email", "Technology", "Data and computer security"], "sentences": ["And last week, executives at NeuStar UltraDNS, which manages the worldwide registry gateway for Taiwan and China&apos;s top level domains outside of those two countries, claimed that the attack has already been used against banks."], "title": "Hackers step up their efforts to exploit DNS flaw", "article": "The details are out, and they aren&apos;t pretty. A fundamental flaw in DNS first announced on July 8 is even worse than people first thought. The flaw in the domain naming service affects everything from email through to internet phone calls and the SSL certificates that people thought guaranteed security on the web. And according to companies monitoring the internet, attacks are already being carried out.  The domain naming service is what tells your web browser which computer to contact when you type in a web address. A nameserver translates web addresses, such as theguardian.com, into the IP address of the computer running the site, so that your machine knows which computer on the internet it should visit to find a site or other information. The bug found by Dan Kaminsky, of security consultant IOActive, makes it possible for attackers to convince a recursive nameserver (which asks other nameservers for information) to visit the wrong IP address.  Kaminsky, who discovered the flaw in March, unveiled the details of the security bug at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas earlier this month. And last week, executives at NeuStar UltraDNS, which manages the worldwide registry gateway for Taiwan and China&apos;s top level domains outside of those two countries, claimed that the attack has already been used against banks. If true, it means that some unwitting customers typing in their bank&apos;s details could be taken to fake sites. Poison bug &quot;We are actively seeing cache poisoning attack attempts on a large scale using this bug. We have to imagine that they&apos;re still partly successful,&quot; says Rodney Joffe of NeuStar. &quot;We monitor some open recursive servers online and we noticed that some have entries that are not the correct entries for banking sites.&quot; Some UK banking sites were being targeted, he adds. &quot;I know our government, defence and banking clients are extremely worried about this, and rightly so,&quot; says Steve Lord, founder of security consultancy Mandaloria. &quot;This is one of those attacks that could have a significant effect on British industry and intellectual property.&quot; Kaminsky worked hard to get the large ISPs and other companies to patch their nameservers, but there are reports that even this effort hasn&apos;t been entirely successful. Hacker HD Moore quickly updated his hacking toolkit, called Metasploit, with code to exploit the DNS flaw. In the nearest thing that the internet gets to karmic justice, he subsequently found that the nameserver of his ISP had been exploited, and that when he tried to visit Google, his browser took him somewhere else. Even when ISPs do patch, smaller companies running their own nameservers internally could still be at risk. Small internal nameservers are just as vulnerable as larger ones. While a compromised ISP nameserver could affect thousands of people, compromising an internal nameserver would only affect the computers inside the company that owned it. &quot;You should not only have your ISPs bring their DNS versions up to date, but you should patch your own DNS servers too, even if it does cause a performance issue,&quot; warns Ken Munro of consultant SecureTest.  Microsoft has already issued a patch for its server editions of Windows, while Apple&apos;s patch for servers running its software, which came later, didn&apos;t solve the problem, according to Andrew Storms of security company nCircle. Apple declined to comment. &quot;Everything breaks when DNS breaks,&quot; Kaminsky told the audience at Black Hat. The bug affects more than mere web browsers. It potentially hits everything - from the auto-update systems that download software upgrades from vendors&apos; websites to phone calls placed over the internet via Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology.  Kaminsky singled out email as one of the most worrying attack vectors. Computers use DNS to find out where to send email. Email sent from a company via a compromised nameserver could be intercepted and read by a third party. &quot;Email has the highest sensitive information to total lack of encryption ratio of all the technologies that we use,&quot; he told the conference.  He said that because of the way most ecommerce sites work, the flaw creates what amounts to a skeleton key for unpatched ecommerce sites. Most of them offer a &quot;forgotten password&quot; function, which enables users to request an email either resetting the password or a reminder. An attacker compromising the site&apos;s nameserver would be able to enter an email address in the site&apos;s forgotten password field, and then intercept the emails offering to reset that user&apos;s password - in effect giving the attacker access to the account. Technology Guardian has already highlighted the dangers of sending password reset information via email.  Ideally, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) - a technology that uses digital certificates to guarantee a company&apos;s identity online - would solve the problem. But SSL is also vulnerable, said Kaminsky. &quot;SSL is occasionally used, and maybe it&apos;s used right, but more and more often it&apos;s not,&quot; he said, and added that 42% of the SSL certificates he checked online were self-signed. If Bob has a certificate saying that he&apos;s really Bob, but he signed it himself, how secure is that? Besides, when the certificate authorities that issue SSL certificates verify the owners&apos; information, they often do it via email, which in turn relies on DNS. But there&apos;s a patch for DNS, so people should be safe, right? Not so fast. &quot;There are entire classes of attacks that may still be very, very effective,&quot; Kaminsky said, and researchers are already proving him right. Reports are emerging that the patch has been compromised. Russian researchers are said to have been able to poison the latest patched version of BIND - one of the most popular pieces of DNS software, in around 10 hours. However, Lord points out that this would have to be done using machines inside a network, rather than machines on the outside, to make suspicious traffic less noticeable.  A patch in time What does all this mean for you? First, ask your ISP if it&apos;s patched. Second, it might be worth switching to a specialist DNS service provider (you can do this by changing the DNS records associated with your computer&apos;s network connection). David Ulevitchof OpenDNS (opendns.com) says that his systems are patched and practically impossible to hack thanks to the way that his nameservers communicate with the rest of the internet.  So what about the long term? After the first, hurried patch, interested parties will be sitting down to flesh out solutions to the problem. But one thing&apos;s for sure, said Kaminsky: &quot;Architecturally, we need to stop assuming that the network is as friendly as it is.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/21/olympics20085", "publicationDate": "2008-08-21T00:47:00Z", "tags": ["Olympics 2008", "Olympic Games"], "sentences": ["Taejin came through 7-6 against Taiwan&apos;s Sung Yu-chi, while Lopez beat Peter Lopez, of Peru, 3-1."], "title": "Olympics: day 13 - live!", "article": " 2.00am Welcome to our minute-by-minute coverage of Day 13 of the Olympics. We&apos;ve got the decathlon starting in the Bird&apos;s Nest and also, starting at 02.00 (well, now, in fact) is the men&apos;s 10km marathon swimming.  2.03am They&apos;re off! David Davies is competing for Britain and he has taken an early lead. How about that! He also seems to have had time to throw away his hat (for reasons unknown to me - if anyone knows please email).  2.07am Davies, who won silver at the open water world championships in Seville this year, is still in front, now level with Spyridon Gianniotis of Greece.  2.12am So far we do not seem to have had any of the feet-pulling shenanigans of the women&apos;s race yesterday but that may come as the swimmers get more and more tired.  2.18am Elsewhere, the British boxer Billy Joe Saunders has been suspended for obscene and lewd behaviour. What is that all about, I wonder? The 18-year-old welterweight came back from Beijing this week only to find out that he has been banned by the Amateur Boxing Association.  2.22am Back in the water we witness more throwing-away-hats incidents with the Australian Ky Hurst now hat-less. Over at the Chao Yang park, meanwhile, China have taken the first game of the beach volleyball third-place play-off 21-19 against Brazil.  2.26am The swimmers have just gone past the first &quot;feeding station&quot;, where they pick up a drink of their choice, may it be their own special sports drink, or in some cases, apparently, some coffee. Not that they need it to keep warm, though, as it is hot &quot;as a warm bath&quot; in the water, we are told.  2.27am An email - full of intriguing information - arrives from John Ogmore: &quot;Apparently Davies threw away his hat so he couldn&apos;t be easily spotted in the chaos of the race. It&apos;s common for 10km swimmers to all wear black caps for the same reason rather than their traditional national colours. The BMX has been cancelled until Friday due to torrential rain at the course, so no Shazane Read for the MBM report.&quot; Thank you John for that. I am refusing, for the time being, to believe that one of the highlights of the night, the BMX, has been cancelled but looking at the rain pouring down over the Chinese capital, that may well be the case. The last I heard was that it had been delayed.  2.30am Oh well, there we are. The BMX has, indeed, been cancelled because of the torrential rain. Britain&apos;s gold medal hope, Shanaze Reade, will now have to wait until Friday morning to show what she can do. Extremely disappointing, I am sure you agree.  And keep those emails coming please. Thoughts, questions, anecdotes etc.  2.35am The decathletes have not been spared, though, and are being forced to run their 100 metres heats in the worst conditions seen at these Games so far. The rain is pouring down and, frankly, is not helping at all. Britain&apos;s Daniel Awde ran in 11.06sec, perhaps not what he had hoped for, but he seems happy enough anyway. That&apos;s the spirit.  2.39am And now to a sport which is ridiculed in many quarters - but not here of course - walking. The women&apos;s 20km is on its way. Brilliant.  2.50am Let us now for a moment rejoice in the fact that China have got another medal, this time the bronze medal in the beach volleyball competition, the hosts beating Brazil in the third-place play-off. The conditions there are awful as well with the slightly random sight of the competitors wearing tiny bikinis while the crowd is wrapped up warm with loads of umbrellas around.  2.52am Just over 50 minutes gone in the 10km men&apos;s swimming marathon and Britain&apos;s Davies is still in the lead. Germany&apos;s Thomas Lurz is lurking behind Davies, in third at the moment, and so is the second-placed Gianniotis.  3.00am Following the recent discussion on these pages about which country has been the most successful in Beijing so far (and, obviously, to make it a bit interesting, we had to make it per capita) I was wondering which country is the worst (per capita)?  Any thoughts? Davies still in the lead, by the way.  3.05am Good news for the competitors (and us, to be honest as we don&apos;t want more cancelled events this morning) as the forecast says that the torrential rain should stop. We should, in fact, see some sunny periods with only a few showers and thunderstorms later in the day.  3.10am A nice email arrives from Hong Kong, where Steven McGill writes: &quot;Commentary has to be up there with the greats. Can&apos;t think of any of the greats name right now but up there none the less. However one question keeps coming up. How on earth are you juggling the need to watch upteenth TV feeds, read your readers emails and respond with such panache while fitting in those &apos;natural breaks&apos;?&quot;  Without getting too technical I can reveal that we have a team of highly skilled operators here in London, updating me with the latest events at Beijing and checking my copy so that I don&apos;t swear, upset anyone or make too many mistakes. As for those natural breaks - they can wait.  3.14am Back at the swimming, the &quot;supreme tactician&quot; that is Vladimir Dyatchin of Russia, is making a move from down the field and could threaten Britain&apos;s Davies, who is still in the lead. The swimmers have been in the water for 75 minutes and they are still going as if they had a dangerous shark behind them. Where do they get the energy from? Remarkable stuff.  3.22am Another feeding station and more &quot;gel down Davies&apos; trunks&quot; we are told. Incredible. This man is swimming 10km with gel down his trunks? What&apos;s next? I mean, really.  3.23am Germany&apos;s Lurz is moving up level with Davies, as I get an email from someone in Australia who can&apos;t be named because she is supposed to be working, not reading our MBM. Let&apos;s call her Karen, shall we? &quot;How do you know who is in the lead of the swim if they&apos;ve taken their hats off to avoid detection?&quot; Well, the swimmers have their numbers painted on their backs which is easy to spot if you are sitting next to a 16&quot; Tosumi television in London but less easy to spot while you are swimming behind the person.  3.25am The swimmers are into their final lap while, elsewhere, Britain have two divers in the 10 metre platform, Stacey powell and Tonia Couch.  3.28am Josh Lanier emails regarding the worst country at the per capita Olympics: &quot;The worst per capita must be India. They just won their first ever summer Olympics medal. Pretty pathetic for a country of over a billion people.&quot; Now, Josh, you may have a point but calling someone, even if it is a country, pathetic, is not going to make you any friends.  3.29am Incredible developments in the swimming. Thomas Lurz has raced in to the lead, overtaking Davies, who is in second. The Australian Ky Hurst, is also up there, as is Vladimir Dyatchin. This is going to be a great finish.  3.34am Britain, sadly, I can reveal is not doing terribly well at the modern pentathlon. Sam Weale is in 25th after the first event, shooting, while Nick Woodbridge, is faring even worse. He is joint last at the moment. Oh well, four events to go.  Intriguingly, no athlete who has won the shooting has gone on to win the Olympic Gold, which is bad news for David Svoboda of the Czech Republic, who is first right now.  Next up, fencing.  3.36am Andy Collings emails and is also voting for India as the worst country at the games per capita. Any other suggestions or should we crown India as the champions of this, less-than-glorious race for honours?  3.38am Love this suggestions from Kim Best in Montreal.  &quot;Running races would be much more exciting if they could use tactics like they do in that violent ol&apos; water race there. No, this is not a suppressed desire to see Usain Bolt rugby tackled...&quot; How wonderful. Imagine a 100 metre runner who is falling behind suddenly throwing himself at Usain Bolt&apos;s calves, leaving Asafa Powell or someone else winning the race. Unless, he is tackled of course. Could be carnage.  If you like the idea, email the IOC. Now.  3.42am Kim also writes that she is having an unusual television experience.  &quot;I currently have diving (is this happening now, or is this a lazy repeat from CBC? Anyone?) with French commentary...and despite not knowing enough French to understand it properly, I&apos;m pretty sure the response to the Australian&apos;s poor attempt was &quot;And that was a beautiful belly flop from the Australian...&quot; Well, that was the tone of voice. I&apos;m also intrigued as to why diving comes in French and track and field come in English... Although maybe I haven&apos;t discovered the magic button yet.&quot; Anyone who knows?  3.43am 700 metres left in the swimming and Davies has taken a few-metres lead. The Liverpool-born Greek Gianniotis is still in the medal race as well. He is second now.  3.46am Davies now about five or six metres ahead. he is powering down the final straight but there is still quite a long way to go. A lot can still happen.  3.47am Oliver Pattenden asks: &quot;This lengthy swim, where are they exactly? Just freely lapping a pool? The regular &apos;Olympic&apos; size pool, or is there like a 5k pool they go up and down once in? Surely they&apos;re not out on a lake or some such natural body of water?&quot; They are outside indeed. Remarkably. Chunyi the place is called. Davies still in the lead but is looking a bit tired. About 250 metres left now.  3.49am  You will not believe this but Davies is not going in the right direction. He is way off line. The good news is that the chasing pack is following him.  3.50am He is now making a dramatic move towards the right direction. Great news. Oh no, Thomas Lurz has just swam past Davies.  3.51am And from nowhere the Dutch swimmer, Maarten van der Weijden swims past Lurz and Davies and wins gold. Davies finishes second and Lurz is third. It is a tremendous effort by the Briton but if it had not been for his wayward directional sense on the final straight he would probably have won it.  Wow. What a race.  3.56am Davies is absolutely exhausted. What a tremendous swim. Another medal for Great Britain, silver this time.  And never mind Davies, I am exhausted as well.  3.59am No rest for the wicked though. The women&apos;s 20km walk has finished with the Russian Olga Kaniskina winning in a new Olympic record time, and Britain&apos;s Johanna Jackson doing really well as well, setting a new British record and finishing 22nd. Well done in the rain.  I can also report that David Davies, who won silver in the 10km swim marathon, is ok and now sitting up. He was absolutely exhausted after the race and there were initially some concerns about the Welshman but he has recovered somewhat. What a performance.  4.07am A quick breather for me before I tackle the latest emails in my inbox.  4.08am A very interesting point from Owen Linderholm: &quot;While Josh Lanier has a point about India - surely 2 (I believe they have two medals) per about 1 billion people is still more than zero. Which is what the about 100 countries that haven&apos;t won any medals have. So surely the right answer is whichever of hte countries that have failed to win a medal is the largest in terms of population? A quick squint suggest that would be Pakistan - (off the top of my head) but I&apos;m pretty sure they are in the running for medals here and there so I don&apos;t expect that to last&quot; Like your thinking!  Scott Mellor writes a witty email, which I will copy and paste in to this slot now. It has been edited though, as he has mentioned one of our media rivals here in the UK and as we all know, there is only one website for sports coverage in this country. Ha ha, only joking.  Good Morning, &quot;The Channel 4 website has an alternative medal table where you can choose to see the medal table by population, GDP and human rights India are bottom of the table for population and GDP Mind you I see the Aussies are claiming to be first combining population and per capita into the equation, dreadful state of affairs what about medals Vs other social indicators like binge drinking and teenage pregnancies I&apos;m sure we would top those ones.&quot; Cheers Scott Mellor  4.13am There is, seemingly, no end to the excitement in Beijing this morning. It turns out that Svoboda set a new Olympic record in the modern pentathlon shooting earlier while in the beach volleyball final, China and the US are 14-14 in the first set. Are you watching George W Bush? Er, probably.  4.16am The emails showing unrestrained support for David Davies are pouring in, you will all be pleased to hear (well, the first has arrived at least).  Paul from Canberra writes: &quot;Hi Guardian, I really feel sorry for David Davies. For years we&apos;ve watched him finish behind Grant Hacket in 1,500m races, and now just when he looks like winning an Olympic gold, he&apos;s mauled by a Dutch giant. Is there some kind of Welsh jinx on him? But he&apos;s a hell of a wholehearted trier.&quot; Couldn&apos;t agree more. The US are now 20-17 up in the first set in the beach volley ball final against China. The hosts call a time out, but surely there is no way back in this first set?  4.20am A colleague here in London points out that the dj is perhaps not being patriotic enough at the beach volleyball, playing American music between points. And I thought the Chinese had thought about everything. Clearly not.  Or could it be a ploy to make the American women lose their focus and start humming to &quot;Axel F&quot; or some other 80s hit.  Well, if it is, it is not working. The US are 3-1 up in the second set.  4.26am Good news from the Aquatic Centre as Britain&apos;s Stacey Powell and Tonia Couch progress to the final in the 10metre platform.  4.29am Equally good news from Montreal, some us will feel, where Kim Best has gone some way to find out how her television works. Kim, you will remember, had some sports with commentary in French and some in English.  So, what happened? (by the way, the US are now 8-6 up in the women&apos;s beach volley ball final) &quot;I have solved the Canadian telly mystery! How exciting. The English is on a different channel (in my defence at not already knowing this, not my tv), although still CBC, it is still intriguingly showing different sports. So, apparently, French Canadians will want to watch diving and Anglophone Canadians will want to watch beach volleyball and strange insert bits which seem to be CBC doing a BBC style &apos;let&apos;s clutch at the straws we&apos;re good at&apos; bit? This. Is. Baffling. What, may I ask, is wrong with an interactive option, or even the choice of subtitles? I think I&apos;m going to switch back to the French. If only for the beard on that presenter.&quot;  4.30am Right, it is half four in the morning and I just don&apos;t believe some of the crazy emails you are sending me. But, a quick look around shows that Chris (a Pom in Sydney) is actually right about this Australian basketball player moaning about the US Dream Team sledging him during the defeat the other day. Ah, the irony. Not that any sledging was needed. The US won 116-85.  4.36am This beach volleyball final is a cracker. The US are now 17-15 up and a time out has been called.  Meanwhile, an email arrives from the multi-tasking Joanne in New Zealand (working, emailing, following the olympics at the same time).  She asks: &quot;A question that hopefully you or someone else can answer: how come everyone&apos;s talking about guaranteed bronzes in the boxing? As far as I can work out the Brits are through to the semis, and if they win the semis they&apos;ll be guaranteed silver or gold. But surely if they lose the semi then they have to fight the loser of the other semi for that bronze - or do both losers get a bronze medal? That seems a bit odd to me, especially given that in other sports where there&apos;s a knock-out system (eg the cycling sprints and pursuits) there&apos;s a race for bronze and some poor soul has to come fourth.&quot; The answer is, I am told, that there are two bronze medals handed out in the boxing for the losing semi-finalists, which seems fair enough.  4.42am Luke Howard from London emails: &quot;What&apos;s going on with the diving? I don&apos;t have a red button... When does the 14 year old Brit compete again?&quot; Tom Daley, my friend, is diving again on Friday noon BST and the two British women, Powell and Couch, both went through to the final.  A question for you Luke, what on earth are you doing up at this hour?  4.45am Well, the US have come out on top of this battle of the super powers, Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh, have won the beach volleyball final. They are truly worthy champions. They did not drop a single set on their way to glory. We take our hats off and will soon take a look at the decathlon, which is going on in the rain.  4.51am The Americans are doing well in the decathlon with Trey Hardee and Bryan Clay taking an early lead after the 100 metres and the first long jump. The inspirational banner &quot;All the way, Bryan Clay&quot; seen in the Bird&apos;s Nest must be helping. Or maybe not.  4.55am Clay has now jumped 7.78 metres in his second attempt. Britain&apos;s Daniel Awde has reached 6.98 and 7.12 with his two efforts so far.  4.57am There is some concern here in the office in London that Team GB, despite its strong showing in Beijing, may not catch up - and, indeed, overhaul - the US and China in the medals table for London 2012.  So we want your emails on what sports we can introduce in order to close the gap. Fox hunting is one early suggestion, cricket another one.  Any other suggestions? Dog-walking perhaps or dogs walking on their hind legs - or both?  5.04am The teakwondo is also underway with, I am being told by one colleague, one combatant beating another combatant. Er, great stuff. I think I need to get back to you on that one with some names.  5.07am There is also an intriguing match going on in the table tennis third round with Chen Weixing competing for Austria, playing Wang Hao of China.  Chen Weixing, doesn&apos;t sound very Austrian to me? Anyone out there who knows what his story is? Hao won the first set, by the way.  5.16am Ah, great suggestions for sports to increase GB&apos;s medal haul at 2012: Here is a good one from Matthew Reilly: &quot;Morris dancing is the obvious choice for the Olympics in 2012, with the inclusion of weight categories to increase your gold medal haul.&quot;  5.17am Another suggestion comes from our multi-tasking favourite Aussie, who still can&apos;t be named because she is supposed to be working.  &quot;Black Pudding eating, Oversized 4x4 driving in built up areas near schools.&quot; Love it.  5.21am Right, here we are with some names from the gripping Teakwondo: Daniel Manz of Germany beat Rasul Abduraim of Kyrgystan in a thriller with no scores until the fourth, sudden death round.  Also, still in the Under-68kg category, Servet Tazegul beat Gessler Viera of Cuba to reach the quarter-finals. We wish them well.  5.23am I can tell you that things are looking good for the hosts in the table tennis with Wang leading Chen (of Austria) 2 sets to 0 in the third round of the men&apos;s singles.  And I feel obliged to share this email with you all from Scott Tran in Australia, which may be described as funny in some areas of this world, but not here in the office, for obviousl reasons.  Mr Tran writes: &quot;Cricket as a way of increasing your gold medal haul? Who are you kidding?&quot; KP, don&apos;t listen to him.  5.28am Chris Page emails about possible sports for 2012 to overtake China and the US.  &quot;Tea drinking? Darts? Use of irony? (Actually, I&apos;ve just realised the introduction of tea drinking would play right into the hands of china... unless, of course, we insist on the inclusion of milk.)&quot;  5.37am As there is a bit of a hiatus in live sport at the moment, I will share with you all an insight in to the world of table tennis, from &quot;Angus Beefcake&quot;.  &quot;The table tennis [women&apos;s] is getting a touch ridiculous - basically, there are so many talented Chinese players that all but the very best can&apos;t even getclose to the national team, so they go overseas. Of the world&apos;s top 20,17 are born in China, but only nine actually compete for China. Theworld&apos;s top five are all competing for China still (but only three arein the Olympics - that&apos;s how tough it is...imagine being world numberfour and not being able to compete?!?), but after that in the top 10,there&apos;s Chinese competing for Singapore and HK. Those are the top twodestinations...good money, good life....but some go as far afield asCongo and Dominican Republic to get a game. Still, none of them will beat Zhang Yining or Wang Nan of China proper -they are just too damn good, though Li Jiawei of Singapore is a danger&quot;  5.40am  Just to reinforce the point made by Angus: the three Chinese women sailed through the fourth round with impressive wins: Wang Nan (Chn) bt Mi Young Park (Kor) 4-2Zhang Yining (Chn) bt Ai Fukuhara (Jpn) 4-1Guo Yue (Chn) bt Jiao Li (Ned) 4-0  or should that be Jiao Van der Li?  5.50am Stay with us everyone, there is more live sport coming up in just a bit. I am hoping that the sailing hasn&apos;t been suspended as well because of the bad weather - as the BMX was earlier tonight.  Meanwhile, more suggestions for 2012 sports which would benefit Team GB: From Peter Young in a wet and cold Melbourne: &quot;What about humour - surely we&apos;d clean up there? Men&apos;s and women&apos;s sarcasm, and possibly an open stand up event. These could always be combined with a more physicaldiscipline, such as gesturing or that game where you try to put you finger through a beermat on top of a glass (the beer mat onthe glass I mean, obviously).&quot;  5.51am Britain&apos;s Daniel Awde is 17th after two events in the decathlon (100 metres and long jump), not a bad effort by the youngster. And with that I will list the last suggestions for new sports at the 2012 Olympics: Andy Collings writes: &quot;What about medieval sports getting a resurrection? Shin Hacking, jousting, horseshoe tossing and that old football where you had to take a pigs bladder over to the next village. Surely GB&apos;s past results in those are unrivalled?&quot; And from James Chapman in Hong Kong: &quot;What about actual boat-racing (by which I don&apos;t mean any of that messing around on the river nonsense, but eight men (or women - more medal potential there for us, certainly) downing drinks in a pub)? You could have different events for different drinks - lager, bitter, guinness, wine...the russians might take us on the vodka, but we would come good again on the alcopops. And if all the rounds were done in one session, it could make for some great telly.&quot; Now we obviously don&apos;t condone that kind of behaviour here at the Guardian...  5.56am I like this. So many medals - and so many ways of deciding which is the best country at the Olympics. The Americans (at least Fox News) has, unsurprisingly, the US top because they have won more medals than China, whereas the rest of the world has China on top... Josh Nealon writes: &quot;I notice that Fox News has the US ahead on medals, as they use the total count, rather than the number of gold. Clearly both systems are unfair \u2013 how about the obvious 3 points, 2 points and 1 point for gold, silver and bronze? China stays top, the Russians overtake the Brits, and the French and Cubans jump a few places. Fair or unfair?&quot; I think that would probably be the most fair way of doing it.  6.00am Wow, it is six o clock already - and now we have got live volleyball on the way. Come on! Stay with us.  The US v Cuba in the first semi-final. This is more than just sport, this is a battle of ideologies. Well, maybe not.  Still, exciting stuff and the US has just won the first set - 25-20. Follow this space.  6.05am The sailing is underway and there is a chance for another gold for Britain in the Star class but more about that later.  The Tornado sailors deserve a special mention, though. It is the last time the Tornado class is on the Olympics programme for the foreseeable future.  A sad day indeed and even more sad as there are no British medal hopes out there.  6.13am A good email arrives from Tim Maitland and, as I have now way of verifying this, I have to trust him. He claims to have met the great Chen Weixing, who sadly went out of the table tennis tournament today. He represented Austria... &quot;Marcus... I&apos;m not sure I should admit this... but regarding Chen Weixing... I&apos;ve actually met the guy and very charming he is too. He&apos;s actually from Inner Mongolia... and is a chopper! Choppers are great - they&apos;re defensive players who play predominantly with bottom-spin often from huge distances away from the table - because, contrary to what you might think, they create the most entertaining matches. On a seperate note... re: the &quot;Angus Beefcake&quot; comment...  I agree in the broader sense that the blurring of the national boundaries needs reigning in. But at the Chinese have been migrating for economic reasons for centuries. Where does he propose drawing the line? You could say the same about Afro-Caribbean sprinters, Kenyan/Ethiopian middle distance runners (USA, Qatar, etc) and, of course South African cricketers.&quot;  6.18am If you are just joining us I can tell you that Britain&apos;s David Davies produced a stunning performance in the men&apos;s 10km open air swimming and finished second behind the giant Dutchman Maarten van der Weijden.  In the women&apos;s volleyball, meanwhile, the US are now a set up and 22-14 in the second. Cuba are on the brink.  6.23am Bad news for the Germans in the Tornado sailing as they have apparently capsized, having been in a bronze medal position.  That leaves Germany on 11 golds, eight silvers and nine bronzes. I mean, why even bother... Ha ha. Only joking. That is a very good effort by the Germans.  Still to come: Britain&apos;s Andrew Simpson and Iain Percy have a great chance of a medal - could well be gold if they catch some Swedes - in the Star class. Will that be Britain&apos;s 17th gold? Stay with us to find out.  6.28am China are so far ahead in the medals&apos; table that it is not even funny but the Americans have had a good day. They beat China in the women&apos;s beach volleyball final and are now two sets and 3-1 up in the third in the women&apos;s volleyball semi-final.  The American decathletes Bryan Clay and Trey Hardee are also doing well after two events, the 100 metres and the long jump.  6.32am Disappointing news reach us from the world of modern pentathlon, where Britain&apos;s Nick Woodbridge is now occupying last place - 36th - after the shooting and fencing.  On a brighter note, though, Sam Weale has climbed to 19th.  Three events to go so there is still hope of, er, a top-15 finish.  And with that I would like to thank everyone who has been with me for these past four hours. I will now leave you in the very capable hands of my colleague Paolo Bandini to take you through the rest of the morning&apos;s action.  6.38am Hello. I fear Marcus was exaggerating just now - both about the capability of my hands and the length of the stint I will be pulling, but I shall try at least to tide you over for the next couple of hours. Anyway, let me begin by telling you that Britain&apos;s Leigh McMillan and Will Howden did win the tornado medal race, which is actually rather misleadingly named, as they still don&apos;t win an actual medal. Instead Spain, who finished third in this race, take gold, Australia silver and Argentina bronze.  6.42am Right then, the Star class race - also known as the one Britain really ought to get a medal in - is up next and should start at 6.45am. I&apos;m going to go out on a limb and say it&apos;ll probably start late.  6.46am British broadcasting values mean I&apos;m now watching the beach volleyball final for the third time this morning. It was a good game, actually, but really not that good. I know Marcus has been asking for suggestions for new sports Britain could actually win at London 2012, so let me throw my hat into the ring by nominating hoopla and bingo (we&apos;d have as good a chance as anybody else ...)  6.54am Over in the indoor volleyball, USA have finally finished whupping Cuba by three sets to love. It&apos;s been a good morning for America, actually - earlier they got their first ever table tennis quarter-finallist when Wang Chen beat South Korea&apos;s Kim Kyung-ah 4-3.  7am We&apos;re now hearing that the Star won&apos;t start before 7.15. In better news my colleague Chris just found some left over cake by the water cooler.  7.07am Am I the only one who thinks Britain need to stop winning medals now. I think we can safely say that Team GB have made their point, beaten Australia, and generally done everything else they set out to achieve. Doing any more now is a) just showboating and b) only going to make it impossible for London 2012 to live up to Beijing 2008.  7.12am A good start - Britain have jumped out ahead of Sweden, who they need to beat to win gold.  7.16am As seems to be the way in the early stages of any sailing race, nobody&apos;s really sure what&apos;s happening. Britain and Sweden both had good starts, but they&apos;re taking very different lines, so it&apos;s hard to know whose is better, or who has better wind.  7.20am &quot;Nobody is faster than [Britain&apos;s] Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson in this sort of wind,&quot; asserts Ben Ainslie from the warm safety of the commentary box. Except the Swedes Ben, they&apos;re now definitely ahead of Britain. As are five other teams.  7.24am &quot;One sport we actually might be quite good at is sea rowing,&quot; parps Angus Doulton. &quot;It takes place in real boats, as opposed to pampered cockleshells, on real water, and is currently practised to my knowledge in several parts of the south-west and maybe other places too.&quot; That sounds awfully close to a serious suggestion Angus, but I&apos;ll let you off because the Olympics could do with at least one sea-based sport which need never be cancelled because of a lack of wind.  7.28am It&apos;s getting interesting in the Star, where Percy and Simpson have snuck in front of the Swedish team. They&apos;re getting a bit of help from the French, too, who have wedged themselves in-between the Swedes and one of the buoys, just to be difficult.  7.32am The Beeb&apos;s commentary have forgotten the first rule of fate-tempting and started writing off the Swedes altogether, saying that the real challenge for Britain now is just making sure they finish in the top six. In the meantime, Jacques Rogge has accused Usain Bolt of not showing enough respect to his opponents. Personally I couldn&apos;t agree more, but my only confusion is that Mr Rogge seems to be presenting this as a bad thing ...  7.36am Percy and Simpson successfully navigate their way around another flourescent pink floating postbox (&quot;mark&quot;) and Ainslie seems pleased. &quot;Inspired by watching the madison in the velodrome on Tuesday, we&apos;ve come up with a new track event for 2012,&quot; chimes Max Hogg. &quot;A 10km race with a 400m sprint every five laps. Up to 20 teams can race, with each team having two runners - a 400m specialist and a long-distance runner. It&apos;s run like a relay, with the long-distance runner (we&apos;ll call her &apos;Paula&apos;) handing over the baton to the 400m specialist (let&apos;s say &apos;Christine, for argument&apos;s sake) for the sprints. It would be fairly hardcore and fiendishly complicated, and seeing as GB seems to do quite well in the cycling, which is similarly hardcore and incomprehensible tactically, we&apos;d be sure of gold.&quot; Indeed Max, especially if we follow the current madison principle of compiling a rulebook that nobody understands, thereby allowing us to simply crown ourselves winners at the end regardless of how many laps we have/haven&apos;t run.  7.42am It&apos;s gold for Great Britain in the Star class sailing as Percy and Simpson bounce home ahead of Sweden and safely inside the top six. This is now officially the most successful Olympic regatta ever for Great Britain.  7.49am That was Britain&apos;s 17th gold in Beijing. &quot;We&apos;re fully six gold medals ahead of the Germans,&quot; parps Adrian Chiles in a triumphant BBC studio. More importantly, we&apos;re now more than twice as good as Michael Phelps.  7.56am Britain&apos;s Daniel Awde was 31st of 32 at last check in the modern decathlon after a rotten effort in the shot put.  8.04am With the BMX postponed until tomorrow on account of all the rain, there&apos;s now a fair old lull before Britain are up for another medal. Phillips Idowu is in with a good shout in the men&apos;s triple-jump final, but that isn&apos;t scheduled to start until 1.25pm BST.  8.08am &quot;Have any of Bolt&apos;s competitors complained at this lack of respect,&quot; demands Simon Thomas. &quot;If not, then everyone else (except me) should shut up about it. I was watching the finish of the woman&apos;s triathlon and the Aussie winner clearly broke into a smile 50m before the end, the hard hearted Sheila. Typical Aussie lack of respect for the others who were nearly 100m behind.&quot;  8.12am The great untold story of the 2008 Games has to be the music being played on the public address systems at China&apos;s various Olympic stadiums. So far this morning I&apos;ve already heard Who Let the Dogs Out, the Macarena and Cascade&apos;s Every Time We Touch, among others. Last week there was Cotton Eye Joe at the Water Cube. For an emerging world power China really could be more advanced in the music stakes.  8.20am Good news from the modern pentathlon - Nick Woodbridge, who was 36th and last after two events, just posted the second fastest time in the 200m freestyle swim. I have no idea what this means in terms of the points table, but if I find out I&apos;ll be sure to let you know.  8.23am The Beeb&apos;s just noticed that Phillips Idowu is wearing the same athlete&apos;s number - 1809 - as Dame Kelly Holmes wore in Athens in 2004. All concerned seem fairly certain this means he&apos;s nailed on for gold.  8.25am My small army of of helpers inform me that Woodbridge is up to 32nd after that swim (8.20am). Glorious. His Team-GB-mate Sam Weale, meanwhile, is 11th after three events.  8.30am &quot;We should be wary of criticising the Chinese authorities&apos; choice of music,&quot; points out Gary Naylor sagely. &quot;I suspect somewhere in the bowels of TV Centre, the sole BBC employee not racking up the expenses in Beijing is splicing together scenes of joy and tears for a Games closing montage. If they use Spandau Ballet&apos;s &apos;gold&apos; as the soundtrack, my telly might not survive.&quot;  8.37am There&apos;s a bit of a love-in unfolding on the Beeb, where Team GB&apos;s entire sailing squad seem to be indulging in a giant group hug. Upon reflection this probably isn&apos;t live - several bad words have just been bleeped out. Are the sailors Britain&apos;s most foul-mouthed Olympic team?  8.42am All those who doubted that Phillips Idowu&apos;s assigned number 1809 would ensure him a gold medal (8.23am) might want to take note. Oliver Pattenden has just emailed me to point out that Alfred Tennyson was born in 1809.  8.48am Britain&apos;s Tim Brabants is through to the final of the 500m men&apos;s flatwater kayaking after finishing third in his semi-final.  8.56am Here&apos;s Paul Savage. &quot;Perhaps all this crass music is something else we need to focus on ahead of London 2012,&quot; he offers. &quot;What are the worst tracks we can think of to play at any event in 2012? What music would put off our competitors most? We must be good at this ...&quot;  9.04am No British action to speak of right now, so I&apos;ve taken the opportunity to discover men&apos;s flatwater canoeing. The canoes themselves truly are a feat of engineering - I have genuinely no idea how a boats that small can support men that large without sinking. Brazil&apos;s Nivalter Jesus romps to victory in the first semi-final.  9.07am More good news for Idowu (8.23am). &quot;Charles Darwin was also born in 1809,&quot; points out Adam Hendry. &quot;Could things be looking any rosier?&quot;  9.11am Right, this MBM needs a fresh pair of legs, so I&apos;m going to stand down and allow my colleague Les Roopanarine to take over. Thanks for all your emails.  9.17am As Paolo heads off for some well-earned sleep, a very good morning to one and all. Let&apos;s start on a musical note: &quot;The answer to Paul Savange&apos;s question (8.56am),&quot; writes Tim Maitland, &quot;is... Aaaaaaaa....gaaaaa...do-do-do.&quot; No arguments there, Tim.  9.22am Nottingham paddler Lucy Wainwright is through to Saturday&apos;s 500m flatwater kayaking final after going one better than Tim Brabants by finishing her semi-final in second place. Paul Savage, however, has other things on his mind. &quot;There&apos;s a great article on the synchronized swimmers by Marina Hyde today that all should read,&quot; says Paul. &quot;If its staying, why not have men&apos;s synchronized swimming in 2012? There should be lots of scope for sequined swimming trunks? And again lots of music choices for themes!&quot; I shudder to think.  9.33am Wainwright will face stiff competition in the final, if the powerful performance of Hongyan Zhong, local favourite and winner of the other semi, is anything to go by.  9.42am &quot;I heard on the radio this morning that 1809, Idowu&apos;s number, reflects the Olympic triple jump record of 18.09 metres, which is obviously far more portentous than it having been Ms Holmes&apos;s number last time around,&quot; writes Steven Thomas. &quot;But it was Nicky Campbell who said this, so it&apos;s likely to be complete nonsense. Fact-check, please.&quot; The Olympic record is indeed 18.09, Steven - it was set by Kenny Harrison in 1996. Britain&apos;s Jonathan Edwards holds the world record, with 18.29; thanks to everyone who emailed in about this!  9.46am And now the news you&apos;ve been waiting for: in the first of the men&apos;s K2 500m semi-finals, Canada have come through just ahead of Poland and Denmark. Meanwhile, Britain&apos;s latest sailing victors, Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson, have received their Star class gold medals at Qingdao.  10.06am &quot;I&apos;m all for men&apos;s synchronised swimming,&quot; says Jack Lee, &quot;provided there&apos;s a compulsory element where they have to headbang underwater to classic 70s/80s rock (AC/DC, Bon Jovi etc.) That would be fantastic.&quot; Which brings us neatly back to the colourfully-coiffed Phillips Idowu. &quot;I&apos;m moving my mortgage onto Idowu,&quot; chirps Doug Falconer, &quot;unless he turns up with gold hair as is speculated. Look at what that did to the Romanian football team at the 98 World Cup.&quot;  10.20am Not much going on at the moment in terms of British interest, but I can tell you that Korea&apos;s Jae Young Koon is locked in an unusually rally-free third round table tennis clash with Austria&apos;s Werner Schlager. Oh, and they&apos;re dropping like flies in the modern pentathlon, where there have been two fallers already this morning.  10.27am If you require proof that it&apos;s been a rainswept day in Beijing, that high jumpers go through some highly unusual warm-up routines, or that America&apos;s Mike Hazle looks very scary indeed when hurling the javelin, then check out our gallery of day 13&apos;s best pictures.  10.34am Not content with turning the air blue in their post-victory interviews, Britain&apos;s sailors have given Team GB sailing manager Stephen Park a celebratory dousing over in Qingdao harbour. Not that being thrown in has done much to dampen Park&apos;s spirits after Britain&apos;s six-medal haul. &quot;It&apos;s absolutely fantastic, I&apos;m over the moon with the medals and the gold for the Stars is the icing on the cake,&quot; enthused Park, still basking in the warm afterglow of the Star class victory secured by Iain Percy and Andrew Simpson earlier today.  10.42am While we&apos;re on the subject of medals, this from James Fergusson: &quot;If the Americans are putting themselves at the top of the table because they have the most medals of any colour, does that mean they are only celebrating Michael Phelps as the second most successful Olympian of all time? [Former Soviet gymnast] Larissa Latynina has 18, two more than Phelps.&quot;  10.50am &quot;Can you update us on the Britons in the modern pentathlon,&quot; writes Paul Binning, &quot;where Bristol City goalkeeper Chris Weale&apos;s less famous - hopefully until later today - twin brother, Sam, is aiming for a medal?&quot; I certainly can, Paul, although it&apos;s not great news: the man from Yeovil twice failed to clear a fence and picked up 224 penalty points, leaving him well off the pace with the top three still to ride.  10.57am Doping has cast its unwanted shadow over the Games, with four horses - including Latinus, the mount of Irish rider Denis Lynch - suspended from tonight&apos;s showjumping final in Hong Kong. &quot;The FEI provisionally suspends all competitors who test positive in doping or positive medication cases at the Olympic Games in the interests of the integrity of the sport,&quot; said a statement from the International Equestrian Federation.  11.13am Taekwondo enthusiasts will doubtless be interested to hear that South Korea&apos;s Son Taejin will face America&apos;s Mark Lopez in the final. Taejin came through 7-6 against Taiwan&apos;s Sung Yu-chi, while Lopez beat Peter Lopez, of Peru, 3-1. Meanwhile, this from Martin Smith: &quot;Can someone tell me why both losing semi-finalists ins sports like boxing and wrestling get bronze medals, and why there is not a third-place playoff? Was the decision made by the same person who thought of banning sports day at school in case people cry when they don&apos;t win?&quot;  11.20am It&apos;s 0-0 after the first quarter of the women&apos;s football bronze showdown between Germany and Japan, although the Japanese have had the better of things so far. There&apos;s no score either between the Netherlands and Germany in the men&apos;s hockey semi-finals.  11.25am As confirmation filters through that Tony Andre Hansen, a member of the Norwegian team that won a showjumping bronze earlier this week, has been provisionally suspended from the Games along with Ireland&apos;s Dennis Lynch, Brazil&apos;s Bernardo Alves and Germany&apos;s Christian Ahlmann, Andrew Adams kicks off the equine quips: &quot;I&apos;ll bet those horses were long-faced when they found out they&apos;d been caught.&quot; If you&apos;re eager to avoid any further horse-related comedy - and frankly, who wouldn&apos;t be? - check out Andy Bull&apos;s live blog from the Bird&apos;s Nest Stadium.  11.45am It&apos;s 0-0 between Germany and Japan at half-time in the women&apos;s football, so the bronze remains firmly up for grabs. And it&apos;s still scoreless between the Netherlands and Germany in the men&apos;s hockey semi-finals. Meanwhile, Tom Morgan sheds some light on Martin Smith&apos;s boxing query (11.13am): &quot;The reason boxing has two bronzes is because there is a chance of losing by knockout in the semi-finals, leading to concussion and so on - which would make it dangerous to fight again. On the other hand, in the wrestling it&apos;s just because they&apos;re big girly men in leotards.&quot;  12.08pm Britain&apos;s Steph Twell has just started in the first heat of the women&apos;s 1500m semi-final. She&apos;s biding her time at the back of the field after lap one.  12.10pm Twell is moving up the pack, and she&apos;s in fifth as they hit the final lap.  12.12pm A comfortable victory for Maryam Yusuf Jamal in 4:05.14, with Spain&apos;s Natalia Rodriguez second and Siham Hilali of Morocco in third. Twell finishes sixth. Only the first three in each heat go through by right, with the three fastest losers making up the field for the final. So it&apos;s eyes down for the second heat, which has just started.  12.18pm Britain&apos;s Susan Scott could only manage fourth in the second heat, but a slow race was good news from Twell&apos;s perspective - she remains in contention for now.  12.24pm Lisa Dobriskey is next up for Team GB, and at the end of the third lap she&apos;s at the back of the six-strong leading group.  12.25pm Mixed news for Britain after the third heat: Dobriskey storms down the finishing straight to come in third but, with the fastest qualifiers coming from this heat, Steph Twell&apos;s hopes of a place in the final are over. &quot;I felt really good and really relaxed. I thought I&apos;d have to run quick to qualify but it&apos;s great,&quot; says a slightly breathless Dobriskey. Nancy Jebet Langat won the heat in 4:05.30.  12.32pm Jamaica&apos;s Veronica Campbell-Brown wins the women&apos;s 200m final in 21.74, successfully defending her crown. America&apos;s Allyson Felix takes silver, with Kerron Stewart making it two out of three for Jamaica. Meanwhile, Tim Wood reckons he&apos;s spotted something that the walking judges didn&apos;t. &quot;Prompted to look at the day 13 pictures by the 10.27 MBM entry I wondered if anyone had made the same analysis as me of the walkers outside of the Bird&apos;s Nest stadium (picture 3/13). It looks to me as if the walker 3rd from right is actually in mid-air while in full stride. Isn&apos;t that classed as running?&quot;  12.42pm Britain&apos;s Goldie Sayers throws 65.75m to claim a national record in the women&apos;s javelin. It leaves her lying third for now. Moments later, Usain Bolt receives his gold medal for that unforgettable 200m victory, celebrating in characteristically effusive style.  12.48pm &quot;I am in need of help as to how to fill my days next week,&quot; writes Matthew Williams, &quot;when I will no longer be able to stare at my screen pressing the refresh button to see if some fat Georgian has successfully sat on a Turk to win a gold. Counselling required.&quot; Speaking of being sat on by large Georgians, Revazi Mindorashvili won gold in the men&apos;s 84kg freestyle wrestling earlier with a 3-1 win over Tajikistan&apos;s Yusup Abdusalomov, who later collapsed en route to a news conference. After a 20-minute delay during which he failed to recover, he was whisked away for medical attention. Let&apos;s hope he&apos;ll be ok.  12.55pm Moving away from the Bird&apos;s Nest, Norway will face either Hungary or Russia in the women&apos;s handball final after edging past South Korea, while Germany have beaten Japan 2-0 in the women&apos;s football to take bronze. Substitute Fatmire Bajramaj scored both of Germany&apos;s second-half goals, since you ask.  1.04pm Wilfred Bungei wins the first of the men&apos;s 800m semi-final heats, but defending champion Yuriy Borzakovskiy surprisingly trails home in third and now faces an anxious wait. Meanwhile, Germany are through to the men&apos;s hockey final after beating the Netherlands 4-3 on penalties. No surprises there, then.  1.12pm In the second of the men&apos;s 800m semi-final heats, Algeria&apos;s Nabil Madi claims a shock victory while both Britain&apos;s Michael Rimmer, who finishes sixth, and Sudan&apos;s Abubaker Kaki fail to qualify for the final. &quot;As soon as I set off I knew I was in trouble - I couldn&apos;t go any quicker and I just felt really, really bad all the way round,&quot; said Rimmer, who was recently hit by a stomach bug. Borzakovskiy&apos;s elimination is also confirmed.  1.30pm There&apos;ll be no javelin medal for Britain&apos;s Goldie Sayers, sadly, a fluffed final throw costing her the bronze. In the men&apos;s 4x100m, both Nigeria and the USA are out, with a dropped baton the culprit in both cases, Trouble for Matthew Williams, meanwhile. &quot;Just spotted that my namesake has written in to the MBM [12.48pm]. Unfortunately this means that any of my colleagues who are slacking by following the coverage will now think I&apos;m slacking even more by taking the time to write in. Which I now am, obviously. But I wasn&apos;t earlier.&quot;  1.37pm You might have thought that the demise of the USA and Nigeria would be good news for Britain. Not so. Craig Pickering made a complete dog&apos;s breakfast of picking up the baton in the home straight, straying way beyond the line. It&apos;ll be a miracle if we&apos;re not disqualified. Still, all is not lost. The men&apos;s triple jump final is underway, and Phillips Idowu has safely negotiated his first jump with a comfortable 17.51m. That leaves him in first place.  1.42pm Britain lie second in that heat for now, but was the changeover ok? &quot;Looking at the video, perhaps not,&quot; says Craig Pickering with some understatement. &quot;If we&apos;re kicked out it&apos;s my fault - not Marlon&apos;s - I&apos;m just sorry, so sorry. It&apos;s not been a very good Olympics for me.&quot; Marlon Devonish, who refuses to blame his team-mate, admits: &quot;If we don&apos;t go through we&apos;ll be bitterly disappointed.&quot; And so say all of us.  1.45pm Britain&apos;s 4X100m disqualification is confirmed. Let&apos;s hope the girls can do better - they&apos;re about to get underway in the first of the women&apos;s heats.  1.50pm Britain survive a shaky first changeover to finish second and qualify for the final. But there&apos;s further mayhem as the USA crash out, dropping the baton again to complete an ignominious men&apos;s-women&apos;s double.  1.55pm Over in the sand pit, Portugal&apos;s Nelson Evora has claimed the lead from Phillips Idowu with a jump of 17.56m.  1.56pm Phillips Idowu can&apos;t wrest the lead back, his second jump scoring 17.31m. &quot;Looking at the American sprinters is making me think Michael Phelps is very lucky that there is no baton in the swimming relays,&quot; quips Jon Blum as Colin Jackson helpfully explains that Craig Pickering &quot;went too early.&quot;  2.05pm Fresh from her 200m win, Veronica Campbell-Brown streaks down the home straight to complete a comfortable win for Jamaica in the second women&apos;s 4x100m heat in 42.23. Russia come second, with Germany third. But there&apos;s plenty more dropped-baton action as Trindidad &amp; Tobago, Canada and France add further momentum to the botched changeover theme.  2.10pm &quot;I&apos;m sick as a dog,&quot; says Goldi Sayers, reflecting on her fourth-place finish in the women&apos;s javelin. &quot;I feel that they started the clock on my final throw a bit early, and I wasn&apos;t ready. But no excuses. If that doesn&apos;t make me train hard over the winter then I don&apos;t know what will.&quot; Bad news too in the triple jump, where David Girat has recorded a jump of 17.52m to shunt Phillips Idowu into third. On a brighter note, though, Tasha Danvers has just received her women&apos;s 400m hurdles bronze.  2.18pm Phillips Idowu eclipses Nelson Evora&apos;s mark of 17.56m with a gigantic third-round leap of 17.62m. He celebrates regaining the gold medal position with a joyous little jig; quite right too.  2.20pm &quot;I like that traffic cone they put at the end of the triple jump board to prevent the participants from starting their run-up prematurely,&quot; writes Elliott Wilson. &quot;A high-tech Olympics with an endearing M25 touch.&quot; It does little to obstruct the Bahama&apos;s Leevan Sands, who jumps 17.59m to move into the silver medal position behind Phillips Idowu.  2.26pm An American 1-2-3 in the men&apos;s 400m final, but not in the order you might expect. LaShawn Merrit takes gold in 43.75m, almost a second ahead of Jeremy Wariner, the defending champion and red-hot favourite. David Neville flings himself head-first over the line to take silver, but Brit Martyn Rooney fails to make an impression after betraying his nerves with a false start. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed,&quot; said Rooney. &quot;I just didn&apos;t do it on the day. I&apos;ve got 2012 and 2016 - I&apos;m only 21 and I&apos;ve got to do better next time.&quot;  2.35pm &quot;LaShawn ran a fantastic race but I don&apos;t know what happened to everyone else,&quot; says Michael Johnson, the former champion and reigning world record holder. &quot;It was a horrible 400m. I don&apos;t know what happened. Jeremy&apos;s first 200m was great, but he did not attack the third 100m at all and then on the home stretch he looked extremely fatigued and just wasn&apos;t able to respond. He gave up at the end and I&apos;m very disappointed with him for that.&quot;  2.39pm Nelson Evora reclaims the triple jump lead with a gravity-defying leap of 17.67m. Phillips Idowu has got his work cut out here.  2.44pm After Leevan Sands fails to make inroads on the silver and gold positions with an effort of 17.26m, Phillips Idowu gets a red flag. He remains in second.  2.50pm Cuba&apos;s Dayron Robles confirms his status as the man to beat n the men&apos;s 110m hurdles with a comfortable victory in 12.93 seconds. America&apos;s David Payne took silver in 13.17m, narrowly edging out compatriot David Oliver.  2.55pm Phillips Idowu paces around pensively as triple jump leader Nelson Evora prepares to make his penultimate effort. It&apos;s a modest 17.27m. As Idowu casts off his track-suit top, he suddenly looks a whole lot more confident.  2.58pm So here we go. Phillips Idowu ignores the men&apos;s 400m final medal ceremony and launches himself down the track ... only to fall short with a disappointing effort. He&apos;ll get one more attempt at unseating Evora.  3.02pm &quot;Here I am in southern China, the home of the Olympics, watching Chinese TV,&quot; writes Jayne Skipper. &quot;According to your updates, the triple jump is on. Are you sure? I have seen perhaps two jumps. We are seeing lots of bird&apos;s eye views of the stadium and interesting close-ups of runners with five minutes to go before running, but no triple jumping! So far this Olympics, I have seen two of our medals live and no ceremonies.&quot; That sounds far from ideal, Jayne. Still, chin up - I&apos;d imagine it makes for less unsightly viewing than that last attempt from Idowu.  3.10pm Leevan Sands has to settle for the bronze after recording a no-jump, so Idowu is guaranteed at least a silver.  3.12pm Phillips Idowu gets his run-up all wrong, losing his rhythm completely as he approaches the board before landing a meagre 15.41m. He takes the silver - but looks crestfallen.  3.14pm Nelson Evora can&apos;t better his effort of 17.67m, but it matters not: he takes gold for Portugal. Idowu, though, looks inconsolable as Darren Campbell attempts to offer a few words of solace.  3.27pm Moving away from the Bird&apos;s Nest, it&apos;s goalless after 70 in the women&apos;s football final between Brazil and the USA.  3.50pm With seconds remaining of normal time in the the women&apos;s football final, Amy Rodriguez capitalises on a Brazilian defensive error to break through on goal. The gold medal beckons, but her attempted chip is saved and we&apos;re set for extra time. What that will bring is anyone&apos;s guess: to a woman, the players look absolutely exhausted.  4.01pm Breakthrough in the women&apos;s football final! The USA&apos;s Carli Lloyd charges through the Brazil defence before unleashing a fierce left-footed shot from just inside the box. It bounces awkwardly in front of the goalkeeper before rippling the side netting - advantage America.  4.15pm Time for a quick show jumping update. Despite completing a flawless round a little earlier, Ben Maher thuds into no fewer than five fences to slip out of medal contention. That ends British interest, but a desperately close contest is set to be decided by a jump-off. Or possibly a typhoon, since there&apos;s apparently one looming.  4.25pm Back to the women&apos;s football final, where the USA&apos;s Carli Lloyd almost sealed a brace - and the gold medal - with four minutes of extra time remaining. Lloyd beat the keeper only to see her effort clatter the post. It almost proves costly for the USA when Brazil subsequently go close from a corner.  4.29pm The USA clinch gold for the third time amid scenes of unbridled joy on the American bench. It&apos;s tears all round for Brazil, though, with the goalkeeper particularly distraught. That brings us to the end of today&apos;s marathon stint. Thanks for all your emails and apologies that we couldn&apos;t use them all."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/24/gmcrops.food", "publicationDate": "2008-08-23T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["GM", "Food", "Conservation", "Endangered habitats", "Environment", "Monarchy", "Rural affairs", "UK news", "Prince Charles"], "sentences": ["Remember, DDT (the pesticide now banned worldwide) was once considered a miracle boon.Christopher Logan Ilan, Taiwan  Regardless of GM technology, farmers have been getting phenomenally high yields for 50 years by &apos;selectively breeding&apos; wild crops such as maize or wheat."], "title": "Letters: Charles is right to back organic farming", "article": "Nick Cohen repeats the usual misconceptions about small-scale organic farming in his attack on Prince Charles (&apos;Charles, a very modern Marie Antoinette&apos;, Comment, last week). As someone who traded a white collar profession for running a vegetable box scheme, I can assure him that the backbreaking drudgery of farm work is as nothing compared to the mind-numbing drudgery of modern office work.  Cohen&apos;s implication that capital-intensive agribusiness has been a liberating force for the Latin American poor is also a serious misreading of the facts. But the real cloud on the horizon for modern agribusiness is its utter dependence upon fossil fuel for transport, traction and agro-chemicals. For this reason, there will probably come a time when small, local, organic agriculture will be the only game in town.  But Cohen is right about one thing - there will be no place in such a future society for a parasitic landed aristocracy, however correct the pronouncements of some of its current members. Onward, then, to a republic of peasant proprietors, where we can grow our cake and eat it!Chris Smaje Frome, Somerset GM seeds are programmed to withstand the heavy doses of pesticides that kill weeds efficiently, so that high doses can be used. Yet the seeds also absorb these chemicals. Most of America&apos;s corn is GM and it ends up in corn oil, tacos, cornstarch in soup, so that even if you watch your labels you&apos;re probably getting some. And it&apos;s so new, so radical, that we really don&apos;t know how our bodies will react to these innovations down the road. Remember, DDT (the pesticide now banned worldwide) was once considered a miracle boon.Christopher Logan Ilan, Taiwan  Regardless of GM technology, farmers have been getting phenomenally high yields for 50 years by &apos;selectively breeding&apos; wild crops such as maize or wheat. On the other hand, GM crops contain DNA from different animals and plants; a GM wheat crop can contain genes from fish, fungus or bacteria to enhance a particular resistance, whereas &apos;selective breeding&apos; between two closely related species is a common occurrence in nature.  Whenever GM crops are grown on open fields, there is a risk that they can contaminate &apos;selectively bred&apos; or organic crops and that is why GM technology is so carefully controlled.Rupert Eden Seville, Spain  Prince Charles might be rich but he does try to think holistically and focus on what makes life worth living. Our complex global problems need science and brilliant organisation to be solved but also, vitally, an awareness that life has more dimensions than the purely practical. Christine Avery Plymouth  Nick Cohen missed the most thorough and relevant research into the use of science in agriculture - the recent UN International Assessment of Agriculture Science and Technology for Development. In the report, 400 scientists conclude that GM crops offer no panacea to future food needs and fail to increase crop yields.  The GM industry is simply using the heightened interest in food prices as a vehicle to promote its products. This is evidenced by a new partnership between Monsanto and other agribusiness giants - the Alliance for Abundant Food and Energy. The group has been set up to promote biofuels - which drive up the price of food - with one hand, while offering GM crops as the solution to the price rises with the other. Prince Charles and others concerned about the proliferation of GM crops are not seeking to &apos;limit food production at a time of growing hunger,&apos; but to prioritise the needs of the world&apos;s billion or so small farmers over those of big business.Clare Oxborrow Food Campaigner for Friends of the Earth London N17 Write to us Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday).

The old town has attracted its fair share of popular attention, from Frankie Howerd to Robert Harris, but rarely has it inspired the scrutiny of a classical scholar who confesses to a fascination with bad breath, Roman sex and &apos;the sheer puzzlement of it all. Where did they go to the loo in the amphitheatre?&apos; And so, while Beard&apos;s new book on Pompeii on the eve of its destruction in AD79 has a sober subtitle - &apos;The Life of a Roman Town&apos; - it will also introduce its readers to the boastful graffito scrawled on the wall of a Pompeii bar that claims: &apos;I fucked the landlady.&apos; None of this will come as much of a surprise to those who have followed the obiter dicta of the classical world&apos;s most irreverent star turn. Mary Beard is a classics professor at Newnham College, Cambridge, the distinguished author of The Roman Triumph and Rome in the Late Republic, and a breezy feminist who, on a weekly basis, also writes &apos;A Don&apos;s Life&apos; online for the Times Literary Supplement. The blog has a global following, with visitors in Swaziland, Afghanistan, Benin and Taiwan. She believes the Greeks and Romans would have &apos;loved the world wide web - this speed, this access and this extraordinary reach. Don&apos;t forget it took three months for a letter to cross the Roman empire&apos;. On a good week, Beard scores a staggering 40,000 hits a day. Visit her site (timesonline.typepad.com/dons_life) and it&apos;s not difficult to see why. Recent postings include &apos;Let&apos;s get rid of the fascist Olympic torch&apos;, &apos;David Beckham&apos;s tattoos&apos; and &apos;One-night stands&apos;. She&apos;s also had a sharp exchange with Zadie Smith about Trajan&apos;s column and put the world straight on the reality of the Colosseum (it was sheep, not lions, apparently, and no Christians were put to death there).  Variously described as &apos;maverick&apos;, &apos;dangerous&apos; and &apos;wickedly subversive&apos;, 53-year-old Mary Beard (or &apos;Beard&apos; as she refers to herself) is famously the don who, having recorded that the classical philologist Eduard Fraenkel was a notorious groper whose nubile prey included a young Mary Warnock and Iris Murdoch, merrily added that mixed with her sisterly outrage was &apos;a certain wistful nostalgia&apos; for the &apos;erotic dimension of classical pedagogy&apos;. So academic sexual harassment was OK? All hell broke loose.  But the trouble this got her into with her bien pensant colleagues was as nothing to the reaction she got from her post-9/11 statement in the London Review of Books that, &apos;however tactfully you dress it up, the United States had it coming. That is, of course, what many people openly or privately think&apos;. Again uproar, hate mail and obloquy. But Beard simply dusted herself down and set about replying to her postbag. That&apos;s the great thing about your full-blown classicist: for students of Homer, Ovid and Thucydides, there&apos;s nothing new under the sun. By the same token, the tall, witchily grey-haired, rather shambling scholar in academic robes who crosses the Newnham quadrangle to greet me on a dank vacation afternoon could have stepped from the cloister at any time in the last 2,000 years. It&apos;s probably the classics as much as her cheerful nature that makes the professor, on first encounter, not so much &apos;dangerous&apos; as an angst-free zone, tough-minded and inwardly secure. Was this, I wondered, to do with growing up an only child? &apos;It was enormously good fun,&apos; she replies, happily recalling her beginnings in rural Shropshire.  She was born on 1 January 1955, the daughter of middle-class professionals. Her mother was headmistress of a junior school, her father an architect, &apos;an endearing public-school boy, you know, [pause] drunkard, [pause] you know. Jovial and clever&apos;. When the family moved to Shrewsbury, which she remembers both as &apos;extremely exciting and slightly dull, especially if you were a sparky female teenager&apos;, young Mary found &apos;friends from many different age groups, and a slightly dangerous load of older men, most of whom,&apos; she adds wickedly, &apos;are now safely dead&apos;. There were plenty of &apos;scrapes&apos;, she admits. &apos;Playing around with other people&apos;s husbands when you were 17 was bad news. Yes, I was a very naughty girl.&apos; At her direct grant school, Beard was the star pupil. &apos;I did Latin and Greek and I was very good at it,&apos; she says matter-of-factly. At this point, she does that English amateur thing of affecting to treat her studies as a bit of a game: &apos;Never being much of a swot, with no interest in homework, I used to do a term&apos;s worth of unseen translations in the first week and have the rest of the term to myself.&apos; As an enfant terrible with a good brain, she acquired a taste for risk. &apos;Beard&apos;s secret,&apos; she says, &apos;is always to be slightly on the edge, but to pull back from disaster at the last minute. When the chips were down,&apos; she goes on, &apos;Beard was happy to sit down with her unseen translations and get her As. So she learnt she could run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.&apos; In the same spirit, she took up archaeology, which gave her the best alibi. &apos;People would ask, what&apos;s Beard going to do for her summer holiday, and you&apos;d say something about a dig. Perfect!&apos; She had plenty of models for provincial trangression, notably her sixth-form English master, Frank McEarchan, from Shrewsbury school, who took some of the clever local direct grant girls under his wing in the run up to the now defunct Oxbridge exam. Beard remembers that &apos;McEarchan was terribly influential. He taught us reams of English poetry, which we had to learn for financial reward. So it was 50p for Prufrock and some enormous sum (which he never had to pay out) for The Wreck of the Deutschland. Twenty quid, I suppose. Enough to get you to Greece.&apos; &apos;He&apos;d probably be arrested nowadays but it was wonderful stuff. You had to stand on a chair - the Magic Chair - repeat the spell, &quot;Beware, beware, the magic chair&quot; - and recite poetry. Anything from Eliot to Bob Dylan.&apos; Another volcanic laugh. &apos;I did so little science it&apos;s an embarrassment.&apos; What else did she read? &apos;Loads of poetry and the novels of Margaret Drabble. You know: How we were going to go to Cambridge, and get pregnant and go into the BBC.&apos; So who exactly was the Shropshire lass who applied to Cambridge in 1972? &apos;Well,&apos; says Beard, &apos;she was terribly left wing. I remember plastering the kitchen with Black Power pictures of Angela Davis.&apos; She toyed with King&apos;s, until she discovered that it did not offer scholarships to women. &apos;It wasn&apos;t until I got to Cambridge,&apos; she says acidly, &apos;that I discovered active discrimination against women.&apos; Today, however, she can laugh about the Roman epigraphy classes where her tutor would pose &apos;clever questions for the clever men and domestic questions for the dumb girls&apos;. Cambridge made her a don. &apos;I became more of a swot - though a disguising swot, of course - I was very much a Newnham girl.&apos; Student drama, music or journalism? &apos;Not a thing. I was wilfully unpromising. I didn&apos;t know any of the sexy people, didn&apos;t know Griff Rhys Jones. At 21, I was what you might call a bluestocking - with added sex.&apos; Beard is still the &apos;disguising swot&apos;. When she says: &apos;I&apos;ve been bloody lucky with my jobs&apos;, she&apos;s leaving out a lot of hard slog. She refers, almost en passant, to getting married (to art historian Robin Cormack) and having two children, a boy and a girl, now grown up. The first time she was asked to write a review for the TLS, she thought: &apos;Gosh, how glamorous. It wasn&apos;t something I had thought of doing.&apos; When family life kicked in, it struck her, she says, &apos;that book reviews are perfect for a woman with two kids under three who has no time for the big projects, but who wants to keep the intellectual wheels rolling&apos;. Beard presents herself as a provincial outsider, but she was probably more in than she&apos;s letting on, because when her TLS mentor John Sturrock retired and she asked the editor Ferdinand Mount who would take over, Mount replied: &apos;We rather hoped you would come on board - would you?&apos; It was a moment, says Beard, &apos;that was the making of me&apos;. Well, not quite. What actually made her Britain&apos;s best-known classicist, and the approachable, slightly batty don the media turn to for quotations about Greece and Rome, was the furore about her response to 9/11. The weeks after the attack, she says, now in classical mode, were &apos;an intense moment of aporia. We were all over the bloody place. It was just not clear how language worked. I suppose my words got caught up in those extraordinary weeks.&apos;  &apos;Today,&apos; she concedes, &apos;I would put it differently. Now I would probably sound like the Archbishop of Canterbury.&apos; But she&apos;s unrepentant. &apos;Yes, I do think I should have said what I said. That&apos;s what academics are for. Speaking their minds is what you want your poor little dons to do.&apos; Beard&apos;s outspokenness got her noticed. When she was offered a blog by Guardian Unlimited, &apos;Peter [Stothard, the current TLS editor] said, &quot;You should do a blog for us.&quot; So I did. I was a complete tyro. I didn&apos;t ask myself, do I want to do a blog at all? It just took off.&apos; Beard has been surprised by cyberspace. &apos;When I started, I thought, oh help. This is cheap, tawdry, debased form of journalism, blah blah. I have come to find that it&apos;s a hugely interesting form of journalism in the most surprising way. I can use the layers of the web to take people to places that would never appear in a broadsheet. For instance, I can give the English and the Latin texts of the Res Gestae. You can talk up, not down.&apos; She enthuses about &apos;this incredible reach. What&apos;s exciting is the combination of this IT Leviathan with a sort of intimacy. My cynical colleagues will say, &quot;Beard, you&apos;re being naive. Think about the power relations. Where are the poor and the elderly on the web?&quot;&apos;  What else would her colleagues say about her? &apos;They would say,&apos; she answers, smiling serenely, &apos;that I work incredibly hard.&apos; Beard writes her classical blog late at night and checks her work in the morning before pressing send &apos;just in case I was too pissed&apos;. She writes it on aircraft and in bars and says she has now found her own voice. &apos;I spend more time on it than I used to. I always go into the threads. You can&apos;t say, I write my blog and here it is, but then don&apos;t reply.&apos; Pause. &apos;You have to engage.&apos; Later, as we say goodbye, she adds mischievously: &apos;I also have up my sleeve a corker of a blog about all the things we get wrong about Pompeii, the number of brothels, for example ... &apos; Mary Beard: A life Born 1 January 1955 in Shropshire.

The 21-year-old has been known to go on to the video clip website YouTube and admire some of his more eye-catching shots on court. He will be hoping to create a few more magic moments to upload during the US Open, which begins today.  The clip which he watches most is of three dazzling shots he played during a match against Juan Ignacio Chela at the Madrid Masters last year, which he rates as a more impressive sequence of play than anything he played against Richard Gasquet at Wimbledon in the contest which lit up this year&apos;s Championships. &quot;I wasn&apos;t watching it on my own,&quot; he insisted, becoming a little flustered at the suggestion that he might spend hours in front of the computer basking in his own brilliance. &quot;I&apos;d never seen it on tape or heard any of the commentary. For me that [against Chela] was the best game that I&apos;ve ever played, for sure. I&apos;ll show some friends and stuff if I want to show off a little bit.&quot; Murray did not say whether he resorted to watching the Chela match to lift his spirits after his disappointing first-round defeat at the Olympic tennis event, when he arrived full of confidence after winning his first Masters Series title in Cincinnati the previous week and was promptly ambushed by the world No77 Lu Yen-hsun from Taiwan.  The match against Lu came after the sort of journey which would knock even the most seasoned travellers sideways - Cincinnati-London-Beijing with a six-hour delay in the US and an unscheduled overnight stop in London thrown in. Murray played in a haze of jet-lag and in heavy, smoggy conditions and could find nothing to stop a defeat which looked all the more disappointing in the context of the rush of medals won by less celebrated British athletes. The proximity of the US Open, which was always coming hard on the heels of the Olympics, might also have played on Murray&apos;s mind in Beijing, for he believes it represents his best chance of winning a grand slam title. &quot;I just think for me, this is my best surface,&quot; said Murray, who first made his mark at Flushing Meadows by winning the junior title as a 17-year-old. &quot;I&apos;ve said it all along: I think I play my best tennis here, I feel most comfortable on the courts and my results have shown that - I&apos;ve always played well in America. So, yeah, I think this is my best chance for winning a slam.  &quot;I love New York as a city. When I missed Wimbledon last year, I realised how much it meant to me [so] I always want to play great at Wimbledon and do well there but just for my personality and stuff, I think the US Open and New York suits me better.&quot; His favourite tournament has already helped him to some extent, by handing him a draw which starts with Sergio Roitman, an Argentinian ranked No102 in the world, and does not appear to contain too many players Murray should fear en route to a projected meeting with Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals.  &quot;There&apos;s definitely tougher draws out there but you&apos;ve got to make sure that you&apos;re switched on from the start of the slams,&quot; said Murray. &quot;It&apos;s not so much that you&apos;re worried about losing the match but you don&apos;t want to have any dips early at the start of the match. You want to come through as quickly as possible and not have too many long matches at the start of the tournament.&quot; There speaks a man who expects to need to hold a little back for the second week; who has the experience of having reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon and now believes that he might just be ready to go a lot further in New York. &quot;I don&apos;t think you really know whether you are ready or not; I just think you do all the things that are going to give you the best shot at doing it and when the opportunity comes you either take it or you don&apos;t,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;d like to think that I can take it when the opportunity comes but, you know, I&apos;ve never been past the quarters before so whether I&apos;m ready or not, I don&apos;t know. But I&apos;ve put in enough work off the court to feel like I can do it physically. Now it just comes down to putting the game together for the whole two weeks.  &quot;Sometimes, in a big tournament, you need a bit of luck. I don&apos;t think I&apos;m ready to just breeze through a slam like a Federer or a Nadal and there will be tough matches along the way but sometimes the seeds go out early and there are some upsets and you just have to make the most of it.&quot; If he does, then expect the quota of Murray clips on YouTube to increase dramatically - and we all know who will be watching them.

What a lovely war we&apos;ve started It was a case of the &quot;home edders&quot; v the sceptics. Our cover story last week - No school like home - provoked a battle between staunch advocates of home education and traditionalists who insisted a classroom was a better place to learn than a lounge. The article looked at research that claimed home education can be an &quot;astonishingly efficient&quot; alternative to school.  And, on education.theguardian.com, the knives were out - first from home education&apos;s defenders. &quot;Earthtracer1&quot; wrote: &quot;Until more than a few decide to stop pandering to the profitable establishment business that is modern schooling, we are unlikely to see the changes required [to our education system].&quot; &quot;Nefertare&quot; agreed. &quot;If I want my children to have the education I think they deserve, I&apos;ll be teaching most of it to them,&quot; he wrote.

Or so they&apos;d like to think, anyway.Jessica Shepherd The senior adviser on the right track After the day job in Whitehall as senior adviser on Muslim issues to Hazel Blears at her Department for Communities and Local Government, Maqsood Ahmed heads for two hours of study on the train on the way home to Leicester.  Slacking on his part would make the dropout rate 100% for Warwick University&apos;s MA on Islam in Contemporary Societies - Ahmed is the only student so far to tackle the full course. At the end of the first year, he says with characteristic enthusiasm: &quot;The course has exceeded my expectations. Even we so-called Muslim experts need to expand our understanding. Instead of just accepting the subjective view from my background, for instance, one of my tutors has lent me books by mainstream, non-Muslim academics on subjects like Islamic family law.&quot; &quot;I feel that this course is the only one of its kind that deals with Muslims in societies where they&apos;re in a majority as well as a minority,&quot; says Muhammad Anwar, one of four highly qualified academics able to provide Ahmed with one-to-one tuition. (There are other students, but they&apos;re taking one or two modules rather than the whole MA.) Anwar is research professor in Warwick&apos;s Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations (Crer) and one-time head of research at the Commission for Racial Equality. &quot;I&apos;ve known him since 1999, when we were both speaking at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies,&quot; Ahmed confides. &quot;But that doesn&apos;t stop him putting me through it when we meet at Warwick,&quot; he adds with a grin. &quot;It can be quite brutal.&quot; Despite the ongoing threat of home-grown terrorism, Ahmed declares himself &quot;very optimistic&quot; for Britain&apos;s third-generation Muslims - substantial numbers of whom have embraced education and are making their presence felt in a wide range of professions. &quot;The chaplain at a top university like Warwick tells me that there are at least 1,000 Muslim students,&quot; he says. &quot;They can&apos;t all be foreign-born.&quot;Chris Arnot What we learned this week Our weekly round-upOn the global stage, this year&apos;s Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings of research universities confirmed the dominance of American institutions, with plucky little Britain hanging in for silver. There were interesting movements within the UK contingent (see page 6), while in Asia, China&apos;s universities still lag behind Japan and Australia, and the top Chinese institutions belong to Taiwan and Hong Kong. But Beijing takes a long view and will eventually overtake Asian rivals - and who knows, even mighty Harvard.  Back in the UK, the helicopter parents have landed. Last week, we learned that the admissions service Ucas had capitulated to pressure and allowed parents to manage their children&apos;s applications for the first time. One in 10 of this year&apos;s half a million university applicants have named a parent or guardian as their agent in the race to secure a place. The five types of helicopter parent werei dentified by Paul Redmond in Education Guardian earlier this year and involve themselves in every aspect from applying onwards - open days, halls of residence, etc. The mobile phone, remarks Redmond, is surely &quot;the longest umbilical cord in history&quot;. Parents will have been closely involved in the dramas played out over the past two weeks in the Clearing process, which seems to have been even more fast and furious than ever.  Helped by record A-level results, acceptances to universities from students in England for 2008 were up 6% (more than 15,000) on this time last year, Ucas announced. A record 375,104 applicants had had their university and college places confirmed so far and the numbers who had accepted places through Clearing had also risen 11.6% on last year to 9,263. And a possible first?

His most recent book is 1000 Languages: The Worldwide History of Living and Lost Tongues, which explores the state of languages around the world. Buy 1000 Languages from the Guardian bookshop There are more than 6,900 languages used around the world today, ranging in size from those with hundreds of millions of speakers to those with only one or two. Language experts now estimate that as many as half of the existing languages are endangered, and by the year 2050 they will be extinct. The major reason for this language loss is that communities are switching to larger politically and economically more powerful languages, like English, Spanish, Hindi or Swahili. Each language expresses the history, culture, society and identity of the people who speak it, and each is a unique way of talking about the world. The loss of any language is a loss to both the community who use it in their daily lives, and to humankind in general. The songs, stories, words, expressions and grammatical structures of languages developed over countless generations are part of the intangible heritage of all humanity. So how to choose a top 10 from more than 3,000 endangered languages? My selection is a personal one that tries to take into account four factors: (1) geographical coverage - if possible I wanted at least one language from each continent; (2) scientific interest - I wanted to include languages that linguists find interesting and important, because of their structural or historical significance; (3) cultural interest - if possible some information about interesting cultural and political aspects of endangered languages should be included; and (4) social impact - I wanted to include one or more situations showing why languages are endangered, as well as highlighting some of the ways communities are responding to the threat they currently face. 1. Jeru Jeru (or Great Andamanese) is spoken by fewer than 20 people on the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is generally believed that Andamanese languages might be the last surviving languages whose history goes back to pre-Neolithic times in Southeast Asia and possibly the first settlement of the region by modern humans moving out of Africa. The languages of the Andamans cannot be shown to be related to any other languages spoken on earth. 2. N|u (also called Khomani)  This is a Khoisan language spoken by fewer than 10 elderly people whose traditional lands are located in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa. The Khoisan languages are remarkable for having click sounds \u2013 the | symbol is pronounced like the English interjection tsk! tsk! used to express pity or shame.The closest relative of N|u is !X\u00f3\u00f5 (also called Ta&apos;a and spoken by about 4,000 people) which has the most sounds of any language on earth: 74 consonants, 31 vowels, and four tones (voice pitches). 3. Ainu The Ainu language is spoken by a small number of old people on the island of Hokkaido in the far north of Japan. They are the original inhabitants of Japan, but were not recognised as a minority group by the Japanese government until this year. The language has very complicated verbs that incorporate a whole sentence&apos;s worth of meanings, and it is the vehicle of an extensive oral literature of folk stories and songs. Moves are underway to revive Ainu language and cultural practices. 4. Thao Sun Moon Lake of central Taiwan is the home of the Thao language, now spoken by a handful of old people while the remainder of the community speaks Taiwanese Chinese (Minnan). Thao is an Austronesian language related to languages spoken in the Philippines, Indonesia and the Pacific, and represents one of the original communities of the Austronesians before they sailed south and east over 3,000 years ago. 5. Yuchi Yuchi is spoken in Oklahoma, USA, by just five people all aged over 75. Yuchi is an isolate language (that is, it cannot be shown to be related to any other language spoken on earth). Their own name for themselves is Tsoyaha, meaning &quot;Children of the Sun&quot;. Yuchi nouns have 10 genders, indicated by word endings: six for Yuchi people (depending on kinship relations to the person speaking), one for non-Yuchis and animals, and three for inanimate objects (horizontal, vertical, and round). Efforts are now under way to document the language with sound and video recordings, and to revitalise it by teaching it to children. 6. Oro Win The Oro Win live in western Rondonia State, Brazil, and were first contacted by outsiders in 1963 on the headwaters of the Pacaas Novos River. The group was almost exterminated after two attacks by outsiders and today numbers just 50 people, only five of whom still speak the language. Oro Win is one of only five languages known to make regular use of a sound that linguists call &quot;a voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate&quot;. In rather plainer language, this means it&apos;s produced with the tip of the tongue placed between the lips which are then vibrated (in a similar way to the brrr sound we make in English to signal that the weather is cold). 7. Kusunda The Kusunda are a former group of hunter-gatherers from western Nepal who have intermarried with their settled neighbours. Until recently it was thought that the language was extinct but in 2004 scholars at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu located eight people who still speak the language. Another isolate, with no connections to other languages. 8. Ter Sami This is the easternmost of the Saami group of languages (formerly called Lapp, a derogatory term), located on the Kola Peninsula in Russia. It is spoken by just 10 elderly people among approximately 100 ethnic Ter Sami who all now speak Russian as their daily language. Ter Sami is related to Finnish and other Uralic languages spoken in Russia and Siberia, and distantly to Hungarian. 9. Guugu Yimidhirr Guugu Yimidhirr is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken at Hopevale near Cooktown in northern Queensland by around 200 people. A wordlist was collected by Captain James Cook in 1770 and it has given English (and the rest of the world&apos;s languages) the word kangaroo. Guugu Yimidhirr (like some other Aboriginal languages) is remarkable for having a special way of speaking to certain family members (like a man&apos;s father-in-law or brother-in-law) in which everyday words are replaced by completely different special vocabulary. For example, instead of saying bama dhaday for &quot;the man is going&quot; you must say yambaal bali when speaking to these relatives as a mark of respect and politeness. 10. Ket Ket is the last surviving member of a family of languages spoken along the Yenesei River in eastern Siberia. Today there are around 600 speakers but no children are learning it since parents prefer to speak to them in Russian. Ket is the only Siberian language with a tone system where the pitch of the voice can give what sound like identical words quite different meanings. (Much like Chinese or Yoruba). To add to the difficulty for any westerner wishing to learn it, it also has extremely complicated word structure and grammar."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/aug/28/adventure", "publicationDate": "2008-08-28T10:11:37Z", "tags": ["Books", "Travel", "Adventure travel", "Travel guides", "Travel writing"], "sentences": ["He proposes a means of reconciliation between Taiwan and China.", "It abounds with laugh-out-loud turns of phrase (a discordant guitar riff &quot;buzzes beneath the chorus like a wasp trapped in a lunchbox&quot;; Taiwan feels &quot;like Denmark with humidity&quot;; Georgians are the worst drivers in the world, combining &quot;the mindless aggression of Lebanese, the terrifying fatalism of Pakistanis and the technical competence of baboons&quot;)."], "title": "Rory MacLean reviews Andrew Mueller's I Wouldn't Start From Here", "article": "I Wouldn&apos;t Start From Here: the 21st Century and Where it all Went Wrongby Andrew MuellerPublished by Portobello August 7 2008, \u00a3 8.99 Can a travel book on &quot;trouble tourism&quot; be responsible? Should a journey to war zones evoke belly laughs? Is there comic potential in a visit to Gaza? The answer is yes, if that book is written by Andrew Mueller. Alone in his London flat on New Year&apos;s Eve 1999, Aussie rock journalist Mueller felt overwhelmingly optimistic. All his life the 21st century had been shorthand for The Future, and on that evening the future looked bright. Mankind stood on the threshold of a new era. But no sooner had the Millennium fireworks fizzled into Sydney Harbour than humanity got back to the business of bombing, torturing and massacring each other. &quot;Why don&apos;t these bloody people just knock their nonsense off?&quot; Mueller felt compelled to ask. &quot;Why don&apos;t they, you know, get with the program?&quot; To answer that question, he decided to visit the most troubled places on the planet. The result is a 21st-century original; a fresh, irreverent, wry and jovial jaunt of a guidebook around our violent and baffling modern world. Mueller starts at Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a spot sacred to all the monotheistic faiths and, not coincidentally, the most persistently troublesome few acres on Earth &quot;for three thousand years and counting&quot;.  He moves on to New York a few weeks after the World Trade Center attack and then Kabul, where he likens the rebuilding of Afghanistan to a reality TV makeover show (&quot;refusal to accede to American hegemony? Sooo last century.&quot;). He slips easily between meetings with Hezbollah in Beirut, a Loyalist hitman-turned-surrealist painter in Belfast and Al Gore in Edinburgh. He is shot at in Gaza. He is imprisoned in Cameroon. He notes that the night desk clerk at his Baghdad hotel keeps a grenade-launcher under his bed. He worries about the discomfort of US soldiers in Iraq who look &quot;as perplexed as people who&apos;d togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address&quot;. With self-effacing humility, he admires the tact and professional focus of British squaddies confronting the Taliban (&quot;At their age, I was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist; they&apos;d voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country.&quot;) An especially poignant exchange took place in Hebron. In the souk Mueller and his Palestinian translator ran into a six-man Israeli patrol. &quot;The soldiers swept their rifles back and forth, up and down, then gathered in a corner.&quot; Mueller bid them good morning and asked if there was a problem. &quot;&apos;No,&apos; replied the officer. &apos;Go ahead.&apos;&quot; As Mueller and the translator moved on, the unit followed them, walking then crouching then walking, always keeping their rifles raised. &quot;&apos;This is ridiculous,&apos; observed Rana, correctly. We stopped. So did the soldiers. I told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk. &apos;You&apos;re spoiling our patrol,&apos; he grinned. &apos;Just once,&apos; said Rana, &apos;I&apos;d like to ask one of these guys what the hell he thinks he&apos;s doing, stalking around my country pointing guns at people.&apos;&quot; Mueller is bewildered by people &quot;who aren&apos;t doing smart things that they should, or are doing daft things they shouldn&apos;t&quot;. He despairs for societies that are &quot;pushing their communal handcart to Hell&quot;. So in his notebook he helpfully draws up a Middle East peace plan (&quot;Point 4: The Palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly, and the Israelis cease acting like jerks&quot;). He proposes a means of reconciliation between Taiwan and China. He also pops unexpected questions at politicians (he asks Al Gore about his plans for violent revolution; he asks Gerry Adams - who for political expedience has always maintained that he was never a member of the IRA - why he didn&apos;t join the organisation?). Mueller doesn&apos;t expect anyone to take notice of his blue-sky plans for candid honesty and world harmony, but that&apos;s no reason for a thinking man to keep quiet. I Wouldn&apos;t Start from Here confronts the horror and failures of our young century with understated joy for life. It is rich in rock opinion, recalling interviews with Bono and Neil Young, comparing the relative qualities of Stratocasters and Telecasters. It abounds with laugh-out-loud turns of phrase (a discordant guitar riff &quot;buzzes beneath the chorus like a wasp trapped in a lunchbox&quot;; Taiwan feels &quot;like Denmark with humidity&quot;; Georgians are the worst drivers in the world, combining &quot;the mindless aggression of Lebanese, the terrifying fatalism of Pakistanis and the technical competence of baboons&quot;). The manuscript could have been sharpened with hard editing but, really, I&apos;m picking at straws. I can think no more entertaining travelling companion on a perilous journey than the ever-hopeful, wildly optimistic yet clear-thinking Andrew Mueller. \u00b7 Rory MacLean&apos;s latest book Magic Bus: On the Hippie Trail from Istanbul to India is published by Penguin.

Manufacturing, all too easily written off as outmoded or dull, has rarely been high among Labour&apos;s priorities, and has not evinced grand-sounding measures such as the &apos;high-level group on city competitiveness&apos; Brown established when he was Chancellor to safeguard the interests of London&apos;s financial services firms. But if there is the faintest glimmer of a silver lining to the coming economic downturn, it is that manufacturing may begin to command more interest from policymakers whose faith in the power of the City has been shaken, and that the sharp downward slide in the value of the pound should give Britain&apos;s exporters a very welcome fillip. Holidaymakers returning to these chilly shores will already have noticed the marked weakening of the pound, as they totted up the cost of their travels; but sterling has taken another lurch downwards in the past fortnight, given extra momentum by Alistair Darling&apos;s controversial claim from his croft in the Hebrides that the economic situation is now at its worst for 60 years. Veteran currency traders quip that the pound tends to go &apos;up the stairs and down the escalator&apos;: in other words, when it does weaken, it can happen very rapidly. Nevertheless, many analysts have been surprised at the violence of the sell-off. Since last autumn, the pound has lost 15 per cent of its value against the currencies of Britain&apos;s major trading partners. &apos;Sterling&apos;s paying a bit for the honesty of the policymakers - Alistair Darling and Mervyn King have been quite blunt about the chances of recession,&apos; says Steve Barrow of Standard Chartered. Jonathan Loynes, European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, believes sterling&apos;s slide is one of the few reasons for optimism in these dreary times. &apos;It is a bright spot, insofar as we have all been saying for years that a lower exchange rate was probably a necessary condition for a decent rebalancing of the economy, away from an excessive reliance on consumer spending, and towards exports,&apos; he says. Certainly, amid the pessimism, industry surveys show confidence holding up better in the manufacturing sector than among battered retailers or estate agents. The latest quarterly assessment by EEF, the engineering employers&apos; federation, shows that its members are still seeing strong export orders, helping to offset the collapse in domestic demand. For several years, economists - and Bank of England governor Mervyn King - have warned that sterling is overvalued, making exporters&apos; lives extremely tough and helping the pound in consumers&apos; pockets to buy more cut-price goods from overseas. Presenting the Bank&apos;s quarterly inflation report last month, King said it was &apos;not surprising that a country which has seen rapid growth of domestic demand and a large trade deficit, to which we&apos;ve pointed for many years, that at some point that would lead to an adjustment in the exchange rate - and I think that&apos;s probably what&apos;s happened&apos;. He predicted that the weaker exchange rate would help to boost exports, and &apos;rebalance&apos; an economy that has been skewed towards consumer spending. The question is whether, after decades of grinding attrition, Britain&apos;s manufacturers have the skills, the capacity or the financing to rise to their more competitive position. David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says manufacturing has been unloved for many years, as employment in the sector has slipped from more than five million in the early 1980s to under three million today: &apos;It&apos;s not just this government; this has gone on since the 1980s. There&apos;s been this absolute fascination with the services sector. I have argued for a long time that the economy is out of balance. We need a strong manufacturing base.&apos;  Brown and his colleagues could hardly have chosen a better city for their first cabinet day trip. Birmingham offers a microcosm of the shifting character of Britain&apos;s economy. Its biggest employer was once the Longbridge plant, home of British car brand Rover. In the 1970s, it was the backdrop for bitter battles between employers and unions, led by Derek Robinson, or &apos;Red Robbo&apos;, as he was known. Thirty years later, as Longbridge tottered, Stephen Byers, the then trade and industry secretary, desperate to save the last British-owned carmaker, backed an ill-fated rescue plan by a consortium known as the Phoenix Four. Rover finally collapsed in 2005, and Longbridge closed with the loss of 6,000 jobs. As if to underline the changing power balance in the world economy of the 21st century, the remnants of the firm were bought up by Chinese company Nanjing Automotive, which shipped much of the production line to China. Longbridge reopened this year, to produce high-specification MG sports cars, but the plant&apos;s new owner expects to employ 250 people, a far cry from its mass production heyday. Even as Birmingham&apos;s reputation as the home of British carmaking waned, however, the city experienced an impressive regeneration, with smart canal-side apartments and the striking Bull Ring shopping centre, home to branches of Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. This tale has been repeated all over the country, as manufacturers have found themselves unable to compete with cheaper rivals in China, India and other emerging markets, or with the technical prowess of Germany and Japan, which have remained formidable exporters.  If the cheaper pound is really to prompt a manufacturing renaissance then it will take time. There are not hundreds of mothballed factories waiting for someone to switch on the lights and start the machines humming again; an army of skilled workers has found other roles and top-flight graduates have often aspired to City salaries, instead of running a business making widgets. So far, there has been little evidence of strengthening exports, despite the fact that the pound has been declining for almost a year. But Martin Weale, director of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, says history suggests there will eventually be significant economic benefits. &apos;The experience of earlier exchange-rate adjustments has been that, while the timing of an export boost is not certain, market forces do work in the end,&apos; he says. &apos;The recent fall of sterling adds to the competitive edge which Britain has gained.&apos; He says that each 10 per cent decline in sterling tends to increase economic output by half a percentage point the following year, so the 15 per cent depreciation we have now had should give GDP a much-needed 0.75 per cent boost in 2009. This could be a crucial extra prop to demand over the next couple of years, as other sources of growth, such as consumer spending, crumble in the face of the house price crash. Certainly, there are already many quiet manufacturing success stories, often under the wing of foreign ownership. It may be good news for exporters, but the shift in the pound also complicates the dilemma facing King and his colleagues at the Bank. After cutting interest rates three times in the early months of the credit crunch, they have refrained from making further reductions, despite the flood of bad news, fearing that inflation, which has shot up to 4.4 per cent - more than double the government&apos;s 2 per cent target - will run out of control. Sterling&apos;s slide adds an extra complication, because it will push up the price of buying imported goods and raw materials, which could boost inflation yet further in the short term. Clothing retailers have already warned that if the pound continues to weaken they may have to follow food stores in making sharp price increases over the next 12 months. However, higher costs only become inflationary if retailers can make those price rises stick, and the more dovish members of the Monetary Policy Committee - led by economist David Blanchflower - believe the economy is already slowing so rapidly that inflation will not take hold. After the pound plunged out of the European exchange rate mechanism in autumn 1992, its value dropped sharply, but inflation remained contained, because the economy was already deep into recession. Weale argues that the decline in the pound will be better medicine for UK plc than the cuts in interest rates demanded by many business groups. &apos;The economy needs an upturn in export demand rather than a revival of consumer demand and the prospects for this are considerably better than they were only a few weeks ago,&apos; he says. With the downturn that began in the US housing market increasingly manifesting itself in the euro zone, and a growing number of emerging economies contributing to the tough backdrop Darling is so concerned about, any improvement in manufacturers&apos; fortunes is likely to be gradual and hard won. But if the decline in sterling is really the long-term adjustment King and others hope for, perhaps for once the Square Mile may not be the most exciting place in Britain&apos;s economic landscape. North east optimist: but help is needed Mohan Emmanuel of biotechnology firm Implants International, which makes replacement knees and hips, says it&apos;s about time firms like his won more attention from the government. &apos;Manufacturing for the last 15 years hasn&apos;t been considered sexy: the ethos of the service-driven economy has been at the forefront of everyone&apos;s minds.&apos; Employing 36 people in the north east, Emmanuel says a weaker pound would certainly help him to sell more implants to the US and European markets. &apos;It&apos;s a good thing for Britain: please God may it be maintained,&apos; he says. &apos;Over the last years, the weakness of the dollar has had a significant effect on our stability vis-a-vis our US sales. The weakening of the pound against the dollar will help - and against the euro, too.&apos; Despite the slowdown in the US and Europe, he anticipates continued strong growth. &apos;Our products are in a market that&apos;s more or less inflation-proof, and demand-proof, because people are living longer. Hips, knees, elbows, wrists are growing by 15 per cent a year in most countries. The market is very buoyant.&apos; Nevertheless, he says manufacturers would benefit from government help. &apos;There used to be assistance for buying new capital equipment - high-productivity machines, and so on. That was abolished. All the rhetoric is not going to deliver in terms of manufacturing, unless there is tangible assistance at the grassroots.&apos; Otherwise, he says, there will be little manufacturing left. Implants International is keen to exploit new markets in the developing world. It currently does all its design, development and manufacturing on-site; but it has just signed a deal which should eventually allow the manufacture of some of its products on licence in China, for distribution throughout the Pacific Rim. &apos;We are struggling to compete in China with products that are manufactured here: we need to be there,&apos; Emmanuel says. Burden not boon: importer suffers For Ian Malcolm, managing director of German-owned gasket maker Elring Klinger, based near Redcar in the north east of England, the cheaper pound is not a boon, but a burden. Almost all his raw materials - mainly steel - are imported from Europe, and priced in euros. &apos;We&apos;re suffering quite severely with the exchange rate: it will probably cost us \u00a31m over the next 12 months, and when you&apos;re talking about a \u00a312m turnover business, that&apos;s quite serious.&apos; Nevertheless, Malcolm believes that a weaker currency will eventually be good for UK plc as a whole. &apos;On a macro scale, we will start to be more competitive again. A lot of our customers are demanding low-cost production as part of the service we offer, and we&apos;re almost becoming that low-cost manufacturer.&apos; Like many other UK manufacturers which have adapted to survive in the increasingly tough global economy in recent years, Elring Klinger has had to reduce the size of its workforce, from 280 in 2002 to 130 today. &apos;If you go back to the times of Red Robbo, [the militant trade union leader] at Longbridge, it was very much jobs for the boys and jobs for life. But it wasn&apos;t the real world.&apos; However, despite competition from cheaper locations, such as India, Malcolm says he has hung on to customers who prefer to source components from nearby: &apos;If you&apos;re buying from India, you&apos;ve either got to air freight at great expense, or it&apos;s six weeks at sea at the very least. If our customer has a quality concern, we can get somebody into their plant in four or five hours.&apos; Asked whether he looks to the government&apos;s new manufacturing strategy for help, he says: &apos;We won&apos;t hold our breath.&apos; His main gripe with the policies of the past decade is the national minimum wage. When first introduced, he was paying above it, but since then he says it has begun to bite, raising his labour costs. &apos;How can you expect employers to match a 70 per cent increase in wage costs over the last seven years? It&apos;s unrealistic. It&apos;s making the UK less profitable.&apos; Uphill struggle: Strong euro pushes up the price of materials for maker of folded bikes Will Butler-Adams, managing director of London-based Brompton Bicycle, believes there are reasons to be optimistic about manufacturing. &apos;If you&apos;re a British manufacturer who is involved in something which involves intellectual property, which involves a distinctive, unique selling point, which uses really clever engineering, then there&apos;s no reason why you shouldn&apos;t be really successful.&apos; However, he has been forced to take drastic action this year as the price of the raw materials for the folding bikes Brompton makes has jumped. &apos;For the first time in our history, we&apos;ve had to add a 7.5 per cent surcharge for our European customers,&apos; he says. &apos;We&apos;re buying quite a lot of our raw materials priced in euros, so we get hit by the fact that these parts are becoming more expensive. We then put a 5 per cent price increase across all of our markets.&apos; Brompton has absorbed most of the rise in the cost of commodities, by accepting shrinking margins; but Butler-Adams says the financial pressures were so severe that he could not avoid asking for a &apos;contribution&apos; from distributors. &apos;It&apos;s knocked our bottom line by about \u00a3200,000. Knowing that we&apos;re taking the brunt, they don&apos;t mind.&apos; He believes the decline in sterling will be of little help. &apos;I don&apos;t think the pound is going to make much difference. The thing that matters is finding really good engineers, or really good designers.&apos; Although the slowdown is beginning to bite in Europe, strong sales in emerging markets - including South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore - are helping to boost Brompton&apos;s performance. &apos;In terms of our actual market, we have seen Europe slow; but in Asia, our market has remained very, very strong. The fact that the product is manufactured in Britain - in London, even - has a real value in Asia: they really enjoy that.&apos; He expects to maintain a healthy pace of expansion for the forseeable future. &apos;We&apos;re in a unique niche market, which is growing rapidly. We expect to grow by 25 per cent for the next few years.&apos;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2008/sep/07/xbox360defectsaninsidehis", "publicationDate": "2008-09-06T23:17:10Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Games", "Technology", "Xbox"], "sentences": ["But it&apos;s very late in coming, compared to the rest of the chip industry, in part because Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the chip contract manufacturer making the graphics chips, was slow to shift to 65nm factories."], "title": "Xbox 360 defects: an inside history of Microsoft's video game console woes", "article": "(Crossposted from the Technology blog, where Jack Schofield wrote it:) Dean Takahashi has written books about Microsoft&apos;s original Xbox and the follow-up Xbox 360, so it&apos;s a topic he knows well.

The unexplained glitch hit around 9am, shortly after the FTSE 100 index roared back almost 200 points in early trading, and left traders unable to buy or sell shares for most of the day.  On thousands of frozen screens across London, the FTSE 100 was stuck at 5440.2, up 199.5 points, in the worst outage to hit the exchange in eight years. The City was left in the dark for hours over the cause of the problem, leading to growing anger this afternoon when trading began in Wall Street.  The Dow Jones index leapt by 1.6% in early trading as US investors digest the rescue of Fannie and Freddie - whose shares both tumbled this afternoon. Trading finally began again at 4pm, and after a frantic 30 minutes of trading the FTSE 100 closed up 205.6 points at 5446.3, a leap of almost 4%. David Buik of BGC Partners said today could have been the biggest trading day so far this year, and warned that the &quot;shambles&quot; could be very damaging for the LSE. &quot;So many clients rely on the LSE&apos;s durability. They cannot afford to be let down. I&apos;m sure there is a telling answer but this is the first time this happened since April 2000, surely there was a message then. In other words, get your act together and have some contingency plans against this sort of unforeseeable glitch,&quot; said Buik. As well as being embarrassing for the LSE, today&apos;s problems could take the shine off a rebound that was desperately needed. Last week the index of London&apos;s top 100 companies fell nearly 400 points as investors lost confidence in the UK&apos;s economic prospects. The biggest gainers today were the banks: HBOS shares soared by 12.5%, Lloyds TSB rose 11.2% and RBS was up 11%.  The bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae - which account for half of all mortgages in the US - followed months of speculation about their future. They have struggled to remain solvent over the past year, after bearing the brunt of the sub-prime crisis. The US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, announced yesterday that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, formerly the regulator of the two companies, would run both businesses. Their current management has been replaced and further funds would be made available, he said. &apos;Vortex of recession&apos; The plan outlined by Paulson yesterday has three key strands: \u2022 The US government will inject $100bn (\u00a355bn) into both companies to allow them to honour their existing debts and keep trading \u2022 It will buy mortgage bonds issued by the pair, starting with a $5bn deal \u2022 There will be an unlimited &quot;backstop liquidity support facility&quot; - essentially giving Fannie and Freddie whatever credit they need to remain afloat. Buik said: &quot;The action taken by the [US] treasury should be seen as positive, but it does beggar belief what might have happened ... had Freddie and Fannie not fallen into conservatorship.  &quot;Had Freddie and Fannie defaulted without the assistance of the treasury and the Fed, the US economy would have fallen into the vortex of recession for at least five years and the ramifications for the rest of the world would have been horrifying. This action is a confidence booster.&quot; Together, Fannie and Freddie guarantee $5.4tn of American home loans. Speaking on US radio this morning, Paulson said that the rescue plan had been structured to protect US taxpayers rather than investors - who he insisted were not being bailed out. &quot;We structured this very carefully to protect the taxpayers,&quot; he said. &quot;And to the extent that taxpayers are going to put preferred stock into this entity it will be structured so that the first losses will be borne by the existing shareholders.&quot; Shares in Fannie fell by 82% when trading began on Wall Street, with Freddie losing 80%. Both had already lost over 90% of their value in the last year. The positive reaction in London was matched by a 3.1% lift in the Dax in Frankfurt while the CAC, the French bourse, jumped 4.5%.  The bounce recorded on the European exchanges followed earlier gains in Asian markets. Japan&apos;s Nikkei 225 stock index, Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng and markets in Seoul, Singapore, Taiwan and Australia also recorded gains."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/09/eu.globaleconomy", "publicationDate": "2008-09-08T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["European Union", "Global economy", "World news", "Environment", "Europe", "Business"], "sentences": ["The same strategy was followed by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and almost every other country that is rich today."], "title": "George Monbiot: One thing is clear from the history of trade: protectionism makes you rich", "article": "It is not often that a bureaucrat makes a major scientific discovery. So hats off to Peter Power. The European commission&apos;s spokesperson for trade, writing to the Guardian last week, has invented a new ecological concept: excess fish. Seeking to justify policies that would ensure that European trawlers are allowed to keep fishing in west African waters, Mr Power claims that they will be removing only the region&apos;s &quot;excess stocks&quot;. Well, someone has to do it. Were it not for our brave trawlermen battling nature&apos;s delinquent productivity, the seas would become choked with these disgusting scaly creatures.  Power was responding to the column I wrote a fortnight ago, which showed how fish stocks have collapsed and the people of Senegal have gone hungry as a result of plunder by other nations. The economic partnership agreement the commission wants Senegal to sign would make it much harder for that country to keep our boats out of its waters. Power maintains that &quot;the question of access to Senegalese waters by EU fleets ... is not part of these trade negotiations&quot;.  This is a splendid example of strategic stupidity. No one is claiming that there is a specific fish agreement for Senegal. But the commission&apos;s demand that European companies have the right to establish themselves freely on African soil and to receive &quot;national treatment&quot; would ensure that Senegal is not allowed to discriminate between its own businesses and foreign firms. It would then be unable to exclude European boats. Is this really too much for a well-paid bureaucrat to grasp?  After that column was published, several people wrote to suggest that the problem is worse than I thought. Senegal&apos;s fish crisis is part of a bitterly ironic story. As Felicity Lawrence shows in her book Eat Your Heart Out, the people of Senegal have become dependent on fishing partly because of the collapse of farming. In 1994, Senegal was forced to remove its trade taxes. This allowed the EU to dump subsidised tomatoes and chicken on its markets, putting its farmers out of business. They moved into fishing at about the same time as the European super-trawlers arrived, and were wiped out again. So fishing boats were instead deployed to carry economic migrants out of Senegal. Lawrence discovered that those who survive the voyage to Europe are being employed in near-slavery by ... the subsidised tomato industry.  But this is just one aspect of a scandal that has been missed by almost every journalist in the UK. While we have been fretting about house prices and the Big Brother final, the European trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, has been seeking to impose new trade agreements on 76 of the world&apos;s poorest countries: the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations. Posing as &quot;instruments for development&quot;, the economic partnership agreements threaten to beggar them.  The people of these countries know that trade is essential to pull them out of poverty. But they also see that unless it is conducted fairly, it impoverishes them more. Many are aware that the European equation of fair trade with free trade is nonsense.  Neoliberal economists claim rich countries got that way by removing their barriers to trade. Nothing could be further from the truth. As Ha-Joon Chang shows in his book Kicking Away the Ladder, Britain discovered its enthusiasm for free trade only after it had achieved economic dominance. The industrial revolution was built on protectionism: in 1699, for example, we banned the import of Irish woollens; in 1700 we banned cotton cloth from India. To protect our infant industries, we imposed ferocious tariffs (trade taxes) on almost all manufactured goods.  By 1816 the US had imposed a 35% tax on most imported manufactures, which rose to 50% in 1832. Between 1864 and 1913 it was the most heavily protected nation on earth, and the fastest-growing. It wasn&apos;t until after the second world war, when it had already become top dog, that it dropped most of its tariffs. The same strategy was followed by Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and almost every other country that is rich today. Within the ACP nations, the great success story of the past 30 years is the country whose protectionism has been fiercest: during the 1980s and 1990s, Mauritius imposed import tariffs of up to 80%. Protectionism, which can be easily exploited by corrupt elites, does not always deliver wealth; but development is much harder without it.  Mandelson&apos;s attempt to deprive the poor nations of these strategies is just one of the injustices he is trying to impose. While he wants the ACP countries to eliminate tariffs on the import of almost all goods, Europe will sustain its farm subsidies. In combination, these policies could put millions out of work.  As Oxfam shows, he&apos;s also negotiating to let European corporations muscle out local firms and make privatisation legally irreversible, threatening people&apos;s access to health, education, water and banking. The ACP countries would be forbidden to impose tough capital controls in a financial crisis: the need for European companies to get their money out takes precedence over the economic survival of the poor. He wants them to adopt a plant-breeding treaty that bans farmers from saving their own seeds.  Mandelson tried to force all this through by last December, warning the ACP countries that if they didn&apos;t sign up by then, world trade rules would ensure that they lost their preferential trading status with Europe. The UN trade adviser Dr Dan Gay tells me that people in the talks between the European commission, Fiji and Papua New Guinea claim that &quot;Mandelson shouted &apos;neocolonial style&apos; at ministers, suggesting that they were so incompetent that they had to rely on foreign advisers&quot;. Mandelson&apos;s office says he &quot;did express the wish to negotiate with ministers present, rather than their advisers. However, he did not shout &apos;neocolonial style&apos; at anyone.&quot; Either way, there is no question that the ACP countries have been bullied. In December their trade ministers published a joint statement deploring &quot;the enormous pressure that has been brought to bear on the ACP states by the European commission&quot;. Over half of them refused to sign anything; the rest initialled draft agreements. Mandelson is still twisting arms, trying to force the treaties through as quickly as possible. Last week the Caribbean heads of state were due to commit themselves, but pulled back at the last minute; they hold a meeting tomorrow to decide what to do next. I hope they have the balls to tear the whole thing up and start again.  If the aim of these negotiations had been to enrich European companies at the expense of the poor, Peter Mandelson has done well. If, as the commission claims, the partnership agreements are &quot;primarily conceived as an instrument for development&quot;, his interventions have been disastrous. He appears to have pursued these talks in the style of a 21st-century viceroy: no humanitarian concern is allowed to obstruct commercial interests. In the short term, and within a limited frame of reference, the commission&apos;s tactics might enhance our self-interest. But we are better than this. If the people of Europe knew what was being done in their name, I doubt that one in 10 would support it.  monbiot.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/australia.climatechange", "publicationDate": "2008-09-10T11:06:53Z", "tags": ["Australia news", "Climate change", "World news", "Environment", "Asia Pacific", "Kevin Rudd", "Australian politics"], "sentences": ["&quot;Population, food, water and energy resource pressures will be great.&quot; While the Asia-Pacific would increasingly be linked economically, the Australian prime minister said, longstanding disputes - such as those between North and South Korea and between China and Taiwan - were likely to remain potential flashpoints for conflict."], "title": "Global warming threatens Asia-Pacific security, warns Australian PM Kevin Rudd", "article": "Food and water shortages caused by global warming could lead to military conflict among the Asia-Pacific&apos;s emerging superpowers such as China and India, the Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, warned today.

After being bailed at Kuala Lumpur&apos;s criminal court, Anwar, 61, said he was confident he could tempt 30 MPs to join the opposition from the National Front government and end its 51 years in power. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, has previously said he will secure a majority in parliament by Malaysia&apos;s national day, September 16. But earlier this week 50 of the government&apos;s 140 MPs flew to Taiwan on a farming study trip set to last more than a week. Anwar said it was a government ruse to ensure they did not cross the floor of the house, a charge denied by the embattled prime minister, Abdullah Badawi.  Anwar pledged today to fly overseas to meet MPs if necessary. &quot;We&apos;re working on it,&quot; Anwar said of his efforts to win over the government MPs. &quot;There are technical problems because [the MPs] have been shipped away. God willing, it will happen. If need be, I will fly to Taipei.&quot; In March&apos;s general election, the government of Badawi&apos;s United Malays National Organisation (Umno) suffered heavy losses to the three main opposition parties that Anwar has crafted into a potent force. Amid the backbiting and recriminations, Badawi came under intense pressure to resign - calls that intensified as the government was buffeted by spiralling food and fuel prices that caused hardship to ordinary Malaysians. Anwar today repeated his accusation that the charges against him of sodomising a 23-year-old former male aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, were a transparent attempt by the government to halt his comeback. &quot;I am not guilty. This is a lie, this is malicious,&quot; said Anwar, as he entered the court flanked by his wife, Azizah Ismail, daughters and fellow opposition MPs. &quot;This is trial by ambush.&quot; The hearing was adjourned until September 24 for further arguments after the prosecution made the case that it should be moved to the high court because of the attention it will attract.

The case was postponed after the prosecution sought to move it to a higher court. Anwar, who was re-elected as an MP two weeks ago, says the charges are fabricated by the government to derail his political comeback. Hasn&apos;t this happened to him before? Yes. The sodomy charges against Anwar echo allegations laid against him in 1998. Then, when he was deputy prime minister and vying for the leadershop held by his patron, the Malaysian strongman Mahathir Mohamad, he was accused of sodomising his wife&apos;s driver. Did he do it? Anwar was convicted in 2000 on the sodomy charge and sentenced to nine years&apos; jail. The court in the conservative Muslim country was treated to the spectacle of the mattress, on which the allegedly offending acts occurred, being wheeled in and out. Anwar&apos;s DNA from his semen was found on the mattress. But in 2004 Malaysia&apos;s supreme court overturned the verdict. However, another charge of corruption that earned him six years&apos; imprisonment stood. Did it end his political career? That appeared to be the idea. Mahathir, who was prime minister for 22 years until 2003, took the unusual step of going on national television several times to denounce his former deputy for sodomy even while the trial continued. Anwar appeared in court with a black eye given by the police chief while he was handcuffed and hooded in custody, causing international outrage. How did Anwar come back? He was released on the corruption charges in 2004, but the sentence barred him from contesting office until April 2008. Mahathir&apos;s successor, Abdullah Badawi, unsurprisingly chose to call a general election a month before that. But still his United Malays National Organisation (Umno), which has run the country for 51 years, had its worst showing at the polls. With Anwar playing a role behind the scenes, the opposition parties stripped Umno of its two-thirds majority. The opposition won 82 seats in the 222-member parliament, up from 19. What will he do now? He signalled his intention to run for office as soon as the ban ended. On August 26 he convincingly won a seat that he had previously held for 17 years. In the interim, the charismatic leader stitched together the disparate opposition and worked feverishly to tempt coalition members across the floor of the house with the ultimate aim of bringing down the government.  Then, to no one&apos;s surprise, he was hit with fresh allegations when a 23-year-old aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, accused him of sodomy. Anwar was arrested in a dramatic swoop by police commandos an hour before he had agreed to surrender to the charge. Aren&apos;t these clearly trumped-up charges, again? That&apos;s what Anwar says. He maintains the government is trying to stop his comeback in its tracks. Most of the mainstream Malaysian media is government-controlled and sodomy carries a 20-year jail term even between consenting adults, so fighting the charges will keep him occupied.  It might slow Anwar&apos;s efforts to tempt disgruntled MPs across the floor. He had declared September 16, Malaysia&apos;s national day, as the date on which he would seize power, though Badawi dismisses this. This week, 50 government MPs went on a trip to Taiwan due to last more than a week, making it all the more difficult for Anwar to lobby tempt them to defect."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/malaysia2", "publicationDate": "2008-09-10T15:57:48Z", "tags": ["Malaysia", "World news", "Anwar Ibrahim"], "sentences": ["The government was rattled enough to send 50 MPs on a trip to Taiwan due to last more than a week to forestall such a move."], "title": "Anwar Ibrahim: rise after the fall", "article": "The Malaysian government has tried its utmost to keep Anwar Ibrahim, the leader of Malaysia&apos;s resurgent opposition, from power ever since he fell out of favour a decade ago. In the late 1990s, Anwar looked set to take over from Mahathir Mohamad, who guided Malaysia over 22 years to economic success. But mentor and protege had a bitter falling out over Malaysia&apos;s response to the Asian economic crisis in July 1997. Mahathir favoured currency and foreign investment controls. Anwar, who was then deputy prime minister and finance minister, implemented an austerity programme that slashed government spending and deferred infrastructure projects dear to Mahathir. The rift became irreparable, when Anwar \u2014 named by Newsweek as man of the year in 1998 \u2014 went on a campaign against corruption and cronyism that rankled many of the elite, including Mahathir&apos;s son, Mirzan who had myriad business dealings. In 1998, Anwar was accused of sodomising his wife&apos;s driver, convicted in 2000 and sentenced to nine years in prison amid widespread international protests. Anwar remains grateful to the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, among others who pleaded his cause and in 2004 Malaysia&apos;s supreme court overturned the verdict, although corruption charges against him stood. He was released later that year but was barred from standing for office until April this year. Following his release, Anwar held teaching posts at Oxford University and Georgetown University in Washington and pursued his campaign against corruption through his post as honorary president of AccountAbility, a London thinktank advocating better corporate governance. In his capacity as a campaigner against corruption, Anwar strongly criticised Britain&apos;s decision to halt a major corruption investigation into BAE, Britain&apos;s biggest arms company, in its dealings with Saudi Arabia. What signal did that send leaders in developing countries, he argued, as he submitted a letter to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development that was scathing of the government&apos;s decision. Even as he spoke out against international corruption, Anwar was plotting a political comeback. In an interview early last year he said was getting round his ban on speaking at public forms by addressing the public at funerals and feasts. He made it clear that he was ready to challenge the Malaysian political elite that sacked and imprisoned him. &quot;I am committed to a reform agenda, I believe in a democratic process and a more accountable government,&quot; he said then. &quot;I can&apos;t reasonably expect this to happen without political involvement. If I chose to submit, then I would give credence to the government and support their repressive measures.&quot; It was not just brave talk. First he helped the disparate opposition parties make huge inroads in parliamentary elections in March. The Barisan Nasional, a coalition of three racially based parties led by the United Malays National Organisation (Umno) that has dominated Malaysian politics since independence from Britain in 1957, saw its two-thirds majority evaporate. By contrast, the opposition parties saw their seats in the 222-member parliament jump to 82 from 19. Anwar&apos;s march back to power seemed unstoppable when he easily won a seat that he had previously held for 17 years. Out of the blue came new sodomy charges, when a 23-year-old aide, Saiful Bukhari Azlan, accused Anwar of sodomising him, a charge that a prison sentence of 20 years in Malaysia, even between consenting adults. Despite the accusations, which he maintains are a transparent attempt to stop his political comeback, Anwar has raised the stakes by declaring that he will take power on September 16, Malaysian national day, by persuading enough government MPs to defect to the opposition. The government was rattled enough to send 50 MPs on a trip to Taiwan due to last more than a week to forestall such a move. As the government goes into political contortions to keep Anwar at bay, the opposition leader says he can get the 30 MPs he needs to bring down the government. If \u2014 and it remains a big if as the ruling party will do all it can to cling on to power \u2014 Anwar finally gets to lead Malaysia, what will this multi-racial country look like? Raja Petra Kamarudin, fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, wrote on Malaysia Today, a website the Malaysian government is trying unsuccessfully to block: &quot;Anwar has to balance the aims of the parties in his coalition, and we will see compromises being made. That is the reality in Malaysia. But I think a culture of dialogue will be developed under his watch and that will be a great achievement indeed. I think at least that can be accomplished by him.&quot; Like Turkey, another Muslim country with its interplay of democracy and Islam, Malaysia will be closely watched to see how it copes with forces for change. Anwar firmly rejects the notion that Malaysia&apos;s &quot;democratic deficit&quot; has anything to with the fact that it is Muslim. &quot;The newly independent Muslim states were democracies,&quot; Anwar said. &quot;Indonesia had a free election in 1955 until it was hijacked by Sukarno. Iran had democratic elections only to be hijacked by the CIA, British intelligence and the oil companies. Seventy five to 80% of Muslims are familiar with the democratic process.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/sep/11/digitalmedia.futureofjournalism", "publicationDate": "2008-09-11T14:51:05Z", "tags": ["Digital media", "Future of Journalism", "Media"], "sentences": ["Poverty, he says, used to cause disease, now disease causes poverty: in 1990 Shanghai overtook Britain (and Taiwan) in terms of life expectancy and GDP per capita."], "title": "@Future of Journalism: Hans Rosling on the case for data", "article": "It was once said of the Guardian - not altogether as a compliment - that it made righteousness readable.

He is on a mission to explode our ignorance about interpreting statistics and doesn&apos;t pull any punches on the way.      Photo by pmo on Flickr. Some rights reserved.He told the last of a series of Guardian talks on the Future of Journalism on Tuesday that a survey showed that chimpanzees scored more highly than university students in a multiple question survey about which countries had higher child mortality rates than others. Professors of medicine were on a par with the chimpanzees. Lots of his graphs can be seen on his web site gapminder.org named, he assures me, after London Underground&apos;s &apos;mind the gap&apos; notices except that, unlike the underground, he intends to do something about narrowing the gap of ignorance between statistics and their interpretation. A great fan of the Guardian&apos;s Free our Data campaign, he rightly rails against organisations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that charge for statistics that have already been paid for by the taxpayer. It makes his job working for a not-for profit organisation (recently acquired by Google) much more difficult. He has a vision of statistics being made available with enough detail for members of the public, using his graphs, to dis-aggregate the information so they can find out about, say, infant mortality rates in a region of Glasgow in an understandable way. Professor Rosling reels out pithy phrases like a stand up comic. The BBC, he says, is fantastic with animation but it is all spent on branding not making data come alive. Poverty, he says, used to cause disease, now disease causes poverty: in 1990 Shanghai overtook Britain (and Taiwan) in terms of life expectancy and GDP per capita.

Since then the company says it has received more than $200m (\u00a3115m) in venture funding. It now has research and development in Cambridge, manufacturing in Dresden, Germany, and executive management, product engineering, sales and marketing headquartered in Silicon Valley. Even though its e-reader is still months away from launch, the as-yet-unnamed device is the size and thickness of a pad of 8.5&quot;x11&quot; paper, and is designed for reading corporate reports, marketing literature, public relations files, and all variety of other business documents, as well as books and magazines.  Professionals read more business content than recreational content, and the Plastic Logic reader is designed to accommodate that, said Plastic Logic CEO Richard Archuleta, who is a former head of Hewlett-Packard&apos;s notebook computer business. &quot;We have created fundamentally advanced plastic electronics technology, enabling us to develop reading devices that will transform the way we publish, distribute and consume content,&quot; he added. Even though the buzz created by Plastic Logic and competitors like Amazon&apos;s Kindle reader will result in much publicity, the odds that companies at DEMOfall08 will be successful are long, according to Matt Marshall, the CEO of blog Venturebeat, who told a panel that it&apos;s just not possible for the market to embrace around &quot;60 YouTubes every year&quot;. That notwithstanding, DEMO CEO Chris Shipley is confident that some of the companies will succeed. After all, over the years since DEMO was launched venture capitalists have poured several billion dollars into demonstrator companies. &quot;We&apos;re embarking on a new cycle supported by real business models that hold up in good and challenging times,&quot; she said in her keynote address. Many of those presenting are involved in the mobile internet and Shipley sees the future as being about delivering information to consumers where the want it, when they want it, on whatever device they want to receive it on.

When the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) was signed in 1996 it was by 14 signatories who represented trade in IT product exports amounting to $600bn. It has now been signed by 70 countries representing 97% of IT trade. The EC is proposing, at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva, to modernise and expand the ITA, originally designed to eliminate tariffs and duties on an agreed range of products by 2000. Peter Mandelson, EU trade commissioner, said last night: &quot;The ITA remains a milestone duty-free agreement, but it risks being left behind after 12 years of technological development. We need an ITA for the 21st century that will continue to benefit our consumers and businesses.&quot; The EC approach is to urge global negotiations at the WTO to modernise the agreement. Others, notably the US, Japan and Taiwan, have tended to launch disputes over how to classify certain IT products. These include LCD screens that can now be hooked up to TVs and video recorders, set-top boxes and multi-functional copy machines. Some of these can enter importing countries duty-free while others cannot, depending on their classification. This year, the US and Japan joined with Taiwan in a WTO complaint about how the EU treats these products. The EC has rejected their complaints, saying it meets all its obligations. Mandelson&apos;s officials said modern technology was so evolved that several products fell outside the scope of the ITA. Similarly, they said, countries continued to impose non-tariff barriers that were a real obstacle to market access. These include bureaucratic practices to certify compliance with technical regulations or the application of obscure local standards. They added that the EC was aiming to sign up more members to the agreement, which has been endorsed by China and India. Mandelson, coming towards the close of his EU mandate, is keen to get a quick launch and conclusion to negotiations, with officials talking of a potential deal within months. He says this would expand global trade and cut consumer prices.

As distressed employees arrived at Lehman&apos;s offices in Canary Wharf and on Wall Street, with some fearing that they may not be paid this month, the FTSE 100 index of leading shares plunged by more than 5%. By the close it was down 212.5 points at 5204.5, down 3.9%, with \u00a350bn wiped off the value of Briain&apos;s top 100 companies. The Dow Jones industrial average also fell sharply, losing 283 points by early afternoon in New York to 11138, a 2.5% decline. HBOS, which owns Britain&apos;s biggest mortgage lender, the Halifax, led the London fallers for most of the day, shedding 17.5% of its value by the close as the credit crunch entered a new phase and investors piled into gold and government bonds. Markets were left reeling by the triple whammy of the failure of Lehman Brothers, the shock sale of Merrill Lynch, and the revelation that AIG, the world&apos;s largest insurance firm, may need to raise as much as $40bn (\u00a322.2bn).  Lehman became the biggest casualty of the ongoing financial crisis early this morning when it admitted it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, after last-ditch rescue talks collapsed. &apos;My career has been screwed&apos; Staff arriving at Lehman&apos;s Canary Wharf offices today had to negotiate crowds of media and security guards before being told that they were excused work for the rest of today. Some left the bank carrying their belongings in cardboard boxes, while others sorted out their expenses or spent the balance of their credit at the canteen. Some staff even spoke of heavy drinking up on the seventh floor of the building. The atmosphere outside was a mixture of anger, shock and confusion, especially among the graduate trainees - who only started work at Lehman this month. &quot;My career has been screwed,&quot; said Jack Reynolds, who joined the graduate scheme last Monday. And Duo Ai, aged 26 from New York, who works in the research department, said that there was a lot of anger about Lehman&apos;s demise. &quot;Everyone&apos;s understanding is that everyone has to go. Everyone is clearing their desks and everyone is very sad,&quot; said Ai, who must now apply for a new visa to stay in the UK. Ai added that staff are concerned that they may not be paid this month. Edouard d&apos;Archimbaud, 24, from Paris, had a particularly nasty shock when he arrived in Canary Wharf for his first day of work as a trader this morning. Having overcome travel problems following the Eurostar fire, he was told that everyone at the bank had been fired. &quot;I&apos;ve taken out a six-month lease on a flat and I don&apos;t know how I will pay for it,&quot; he said. The bank employs 26,000 people worlwide, including 4,000 staff in London and another 1,000 in High Wycombe. A rumour even swept the City that the bonuses already handed to staff could be clawed back, if it could be proven that Lehman was no longer solvent when the money was paid. Across the Atlantic, staff leaving Lehman&apos;s New York office found that they had become the city&apos;s latest tourist attraction - as Lehman-branded items began appearing on eBay. Market gloom Banks were hit hard in London, amid fears that they could suffer badly from Lehman&apos;s collapse into bankruptcy. HBOS lost more than 30% at one stage but closed down 49.5p or 17.5% at 232.5p. Barclays ended down 34.5p at 316p and Royal Bank of Scotland lost 23.4p at 210.5p. Today&apos;s losses wiped out the FTSE&apos;s recovery last Thursday and Friday, pushing it closer to its lowest closing point in the last year, 5071 points, set on July 16 2008. Stockmarkets across Europe also took a bath, with Germany&apos;s DAX index losing 2.7% and the French CAC falling by 3.8%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.5%, or 283 points, to 11138 by 6.15pm BST. Shares in AIG crashed more than 50%, while Merrill Lynch gained 26% after being bought by Bank of America. The sharp falls came despite the central banks pumping billions of fresh liquidity into the system in an attempt to stabilise the market. The Bank of England offered \u00a35bn of new funding, which was five times oversubscribed, and the European Central Bank awarded \u20ac30bn (\u00a323.8bn) which was three times oversubscribed. John McFall MP, chair of the Treasury select committee, told Guardian.co.uk today that he fears that more banks will collapse. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve seen a weekend like it since the late 1920s,&quot; said McFall. &quot;It proves that the market is different. Indeed there is no market, it&apos;s all falling back on the state.&quot; And City commentator David Buik warned that a painful recession was inevitable. &quot;The fact that banks&apos; capital bases have been hit hard again means there is less money to be lent and in a more discerning fashion, which will result in less disposable income being spent in the shopping malls which will trigger higher unemployment and the inevitable fall in to recession,&quot; he said.

It is well placed to ship vast quantities of minibooks to large businesses, if it so desires, and it may be unopposed.

He has run every day for the past 44 years - and has just reached his target of competing in 100 different countries before his 70th birthday. He has no intention of stopping. &apos;Why give up?&apos; he said before going to the start line to complete his century in a half-marathon in the Faroe Islands earlier this month. &apos;If you enjoy eating a nice steak you don&apos;t stop just because you&apos;re getting old. I&apos;m healthy and hopefully I&apos;ll live for a long time yet.&apos; Hill, who in 1970 ran the world&apos;s second fastest marathon (the fastest if you disregard the one quicker time that was later discredited), still averages about 30 miles&apos; training a week. Last year his aggregate running distance passed 150,000 miles. He will be 70 on Thursday, when he will take part in a 5km race at Littleborough in Lancashire with more than 500 others. The disappointment of finishing outside the top 10 in the marathon and 10,000metres at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964 is what motivated Hill to knuckle down, as he puts it, and commit to running every day. He has kept up the sequence of doing at least a mile a day since then only by ignoring serious injury. &apos;I&apos;ve been in a head-on car crash that broke my sternum and still ran a mile the next day. Another time I had a bunion operation and ran a mile a day for six weeks while in a plaster cast.&apos; What about illness? &apos;Yes, I&apos;ve been ill, but illness is nothing.&apos; Earlier this year, when The Observer was trying to help Hill set up a race with British troops in Afghanistan, he sent me an email: &apos;On June 22 I fell coming down a steep road on the Greek island of Santorini breaking my left humerus bone in three places. I have run every day since. This will not stop me! Ron&apos;. The Afghanistan race never materialised. Cue another email, this one a little disconsolate: &apos;The commanders in Kandahar were not willing to accept the risk of me running 12K in 52degC heat and at altitude without proper acclimatisation. Thanks for your efforts. Ron&apos;. We exchanged emails again after his half marathon in the Faroes. &apos;It was a very tough course - lots of hills - but I managed it all right. Not so five metres after the finish. I looked down to stop my watch, failed to see a brick speed bump and went full length, hitting my left elbow and shoulder of my recently broken arm and my right knee. I don&apos;t think I have broken it again, but it is very sore and cannot have helped!&apos; His failure to mention how fast he ran made me suspect he had been slow. Not a bit of it, even if he did think his time, which would have done credit to someone half his age, could have been better. Pressed to reveal all, he said: &apos;I told the organisers I was looking to beat two hours but was still slightly disappointed with 1:53:29. The winner took over 1hr 22mins.&apos; Hill, who was born in Accrington, Lancashire, was a frail child. &apos;If I headed a football it would knock my head off and I was frightened to death of a cricket ball whizzing down at 50mph.&apos; He was inspired to start running by Alf Tupper, a fictional hero of boys&apos; comics. &apos;We lived in a two-up, two-down terrace house with a toilet in the backyard,&apos; he says. &apos;Alf was slightly worse off because he didn&apos;t know who his parents were and he lived under railways arches, but he&apos;d still go down to White City in London, hop over the railings and beat the people from Oxford and Cambridge.&apos; At Accrington Grammar School, Hill says he was the only one who looked forward to the annual cross country races, which were compulsory. In his first year he finished in the top 10, a performance that, typically, he gives context by saying: &apos;That put me in the top five per cent on natural ability. &apos;Nobody trained, and I didn&apos;t either then, but I was a lot more motivated than the ones who used to go round the corner to smoke a cigarette and join in on the way back.&apos; Hill joined Clayton-le-Moors Harriers in 1953 but did not start to train seriously until he went to Manchester University in 1957. &apos;A bit like Alf Tupper, I thought, &quot;I&apos;m not going to run with these university guys because they&apos;ll all be snobs&quot;,&apos; he says. &apos;But one Wednesday afternoon I went for a run with them and found they were quite regular guys. I did fairly well and they put me in the third team and I worked my way up from there.&apos; Hill&apos;s first significant success was winning the Liverpool City marathon in August 1961. Fifteen miles was the most he had run previously and he entered only because he could find no other race to satisfy his desire to compete every weekend. He based his running on doing five-minute miles, far too quick then for a marathon, and remembers thinking: &apos;Why&apos;s it so slow? What&apos;s going on?&apos; Despite having to run more than 10 miles further than ever before he held it together to win in 2hr 24min 22sec. The race finished in a packed Anfield football ground, the crowd having come principally to watch Liverpool play a pre-season friendly. The race did, though, receive coverage in the national press. &apos;My legs were solid and I wasn&apos;t going to do another marathon,&apos; Hill says, &apos;but when I started to read accounts of the race in the Guardian and Telegraph I thought, &quot;Mmm, it&apos;s good this. I&apos;m getting some recognition.&quot;&apos; Liverpool was the first of 115 marathons for Hill, including those at the 1964 and 1972 Olympic Games in which he failed to produce his best form. He also ran two Olympic 10,000m, in 1964 and 1968. His outstanding marathons were in 1970. He lowered the record for the notoriously tough Boston race by three minutes to 2:10:30 in April that year and three months later at the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh he did 2:09:28, the first sub 2:10 marathon over a course whose distance was reckoned to be correct. His time of 29min 24sec over the first 10km in Edinburgh was 2:04 marathon pace, recklessly fast many thought. But once again he kept going strongly and won by more than two-and-a-half minutes from Jim Alder of Scotland. His name is also associated with the manufacture of innovative running gear, which is something that has interested him since he emerged from university with a PhD in textile chemistry. In hot-weather races in the 1960s he introduced competing in a string vest and bikini shorts (often without shoes). He started his company, Ron Hill Sports, in 1970 &apos;because I wasn&apos;t satisfied with the clothing that was being offered commercially by other companies&apos;. &apos;I had experience of fabrics and understood how they worked. We introduced synthetics into running clothing instead of cotton, which gets very heavy when it&apos;s wet.&apos; Other things the company developed included wrap-over shorts, mesh vests, waterproof running jackets and reflective strips &apos;because I was running to and from work in the dark in winter and wondered what I needed to stay safe&apos;. At one point sales exceeded \u00a36m but the company ran into financial difficulties in the recession of the early 1990s and Hill sold out. These days he makes what he calls technical socks, and the business, Hilly Clothing, is thriving. Hill, who lives in Hyde, has a theory that it is not only the rise of other nations that has caused British middle- and long-distance running to decline. &apos;In 2002, the Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester in a stadium that I can see from my road. I was a world record holder and Commonwealth Games marathon champion and I wasn&apos;t even invited to go to the stadium. That just shows what status we have.

Called the G1, the new phone is made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC and presents a direct challenge to Apple&apos;s iPhone and the dominance of the world&apos;s largest mobile phone maker, Nokia. The new handset - which is likely to be characterised as the first G-phone - has a touchscreen like the iPhone but includes a slide-out Qwerty keypad. The phone has previously been referred to as the HTC Dream and the &quot;Kila&quot;, the project name given by T-Mobile and a reference to the network&apos;s hope that it will prove an effective weapon against the iPhone. The phone is expected to go on sale in the US next month with hopes that it will be available in the UK by Christmas - depending on demand in the North American market. It is expected to cost about $199 (\u00a3108), which would put it on a par with the basic 8GB version of the iPhone sold by AT&amp;T. The arrival of the G1 is the latest salvo in a fight to control the software that will power the next generation of mobile phones, which can access the internet. More devices from other manufacturers will follow next year.  When Google announced its plans for Android last year they came alongside the unveiling of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of mobile phone makers and networks whose stated purpose is to &quot;accelerate innovation in mobile and offer consumers a richer, less expensive, and better mobile experience&quot;. As part of this plan, they made Android a so-called &quot;open platform&quot;, which means no one is charged to use it either in a device or as a basis for writing applications. As a result, anyone can write programmes that will run on an Android phone - from maps and calendars to word-processing software and games. A similar developer community has already sprung up around the iPhone, whose software is controlled by Apple although anyone can write applications that will run on it. Users of the phone and the iPod Touch have downloaded the 3,000 applications available from the iTunes store more than 100m times since it opened on July 8 this year. But iPhone applications are only available through the iTunes store, meaning that Apple controls what is available to users. Applications for the G1 can be downloaded from anywhere, although there is talk that Google, HTC and T-Mobile will set up some sort of applications repository . Nokia hit back at both Android and the iPhone in June by buying out the British mobile phone software company Symbian and announcing it would make its operating system - which powers about 60% of the global &quot;smartphone&quot; market - free. The hope for Google is that ultimately Android will help more mobile customers get online through their mobile phone.  For many people in the developing world, the only way they are likely to get on the web, for the foreseeable future, is through a mobile device.  A quarter of a century on from the arrival of the personal computer there are roughly 1bn in use worldwide but that many mobile phones are sold every year. And growth in mobile usage is increasingly in the developing world, where fixed-line infrastructure is often patchy at best. Being the first to market will be a source of pride for HTC, the Taiwanese company known mainly as a maker of handsets that run on Microsoft&apos;s Windows Mobile operating system.  LG and Samsung will unveil their first Google-powered mobile phones next year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/22/china", "publicationDate": "2008-09-22T09:35:13Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Kidney stones", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["If there are fresh problems, they must be even more sternly punished under the law.&quot; Japan, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are among Asian countries that have banned or recalled Chinese milk products."], "title": "China milk scare spreads to 54,000 children", "article": "Contaminated milk has poisoned 54,000 children in China at last count, according to officials. Nearly 13,000 remain in hospital after drinking milk products that contained the industrial chemical melamine. Four children have died and more than 100 are seriously ill. Amid growing public outcry, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, visited hospitals in Beijing over the weekend and threatened harsh punishment for the culprits. &quot;The public is worried, doctors are worried, and we&apos;re also worried,&quot; he said, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. &quot;What we are trying to do is to ensure no such event happens in future, by punishing those responsible. None of those companies lacking professional ethics or social morals will be let off. &quot;The most crucial point is that after a clean-up there can be no problems at all with newly produced milk products.

Melamine was found in products from China&apos;s three biggest dairy companies. The chemical is used to make plastics and is high in nitrogen, which makes products appear to have a high protein count. Ingesting small amounts is not thought to cause harm, but sustained consumption can cause kidney stones and renal failure, especially in children. Most of the victims are under two years old. Hong Kong is thought to have discovered its first victim: a three-year-old girl diagnosed with a kidney stone at the weekend. She had drunk two glasses a day of a high-calcium, low-fat milk product for more than a year. Other children in the territory are being tested. The Sanlu Group, China&apos;s biggest infant milk powder producer, knew of the problems with melamine for more than a month but kept quiet while Beijing hosted the Olympics. The government has promised free treatment for affected children, but parents are worried about long-term illness and doctors&apos; bills. The scandal is hitting the farming industry. The Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing their cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. The ministry has promised subsidies to prop them up. The milk scandal has again shaken trust in Chinese products after scares last year over toxic and shoddy goods ranging from toothpaste and drugs to pet food and toys."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/22/original.writing.china.reflected.zhu.wen", "publicationDate": "2008-09-22T10:55:15Z", "tags": ["Chinese literature", "Fiction", "Books", "Original writing", "Culture", "Hari Kunzru"], "sentences": ["Two years ago Mainland China tried to gift Taiwan with two cute pandas, &quot;Tuantuan&quot; and &quot;Yuanyuan&quot;, but the Taiwanese (who are also Chinese) were far too sharp, and saw right through the trick - they declined the gift."], "title": "Short fiction: Collecting by Zhu Wen", "article": "Britain is a nation of museums, where they have collected everything worth collecting. A good museum typically requires generations of hard work. With long and careful planning the British have plundered collectibles from Egypt, India and Mexico, from China, and all corners of the world, carting valuables home like tireless ants. They spent no small amount of taxpayers&apos; money doing this, and they have spent even more on preservation. They were spending pounds sterling, and everyone knows how far the pound goes. Of course, their first priority was collecting all the valuables of their own nation - that&apos;s the way it always is. Their best-preserved item is the British royal family, ie the Queen. This family is ancient, and by now a little eccentric; like all the world&apos;s most celebrated families, its descendants want nothing so much as to up and vanish like drops of water returning to the sea. Unfortunately for them they were born in Britain, where this human right is denied to them. The British nation spends vast sums every year maintaining the royal family in luxury, so that they can be revered by the British people and tourists from around the world. The money probably isn&apos;t as important as the feeling: maintaining the royal family&apos;s identity as the centre of Britain, even of the entire world. It&apos;s a hopeless task, and it&apos;s hard to imagine another country devoting so much effort to such an absurd business.Some people believe the British royal family arranged for the death of Princess Diana. I don&apos;t think so: there wasn&apos;t any need for Buckingham Palace to do it, nor do I think they had the resources. But Princess Diana&apos;s behaviour was ruining the most precious item ever to grace Britain&apos;s collection, and I imagine this was a great distress to those keen on this particular item. That much is for sure. We Chinese know all about the distress collecting can bring. In 1860, more than 3,000 British gentlemen broke into China&apos;s Yuanmingyuan and carted off countless unmatched treasures before putting it to the torch. In 1900 they returned, once again carting off countless treasures, and once again putting it to the torch. Many Chinese cultural heritage experts, returning from visits to British museums, say that the British have impeccable taste when it comes to collecting - they only took the good stuff. Many Chinese can&apos;t understand why the British had to burn things down when they were finished looting, it seems entirely gratuitous. To be honest, it may be a good thing that those artifacts are all being kept in Britain, as they&apos;ll be better preserved there. But why start the fires? For this the Chinese have never forgiven the British. In order to gain a little favour with the Chinese, the British government returned Hong Kong to China, lock, stock and barrel. Old man Patten, who had just been relieved of the governorship of Hong Kong, and Prince Charles, who had just been divorced, secretly departed Hong Kong in a small fishing boat in the middle of the night on June 30, 1997. Yet still the Chinese are unhappy: why did you have to burn it down? There&apos;s only one reasonable explanation for this; it also has to do with collecting. Yuanmingyuan and the Summer Palace were not merely the residences of the Empress Dowager Cixi and the emperor, they were chiefly museums - at that time some of the biggest museums in the Far East, even the world. They were unique and unrivalled, both in terms of their collections and the design of the displays. This was an affront to the far-ranging British, who could not accept that the world held better museums than theirs, or more avid collectors than they. So they burnt Yuanmingyuan to ensure their pre-eminence in the world of collecting. But even the British collectors have lapses in judgment, and they left behind something that should not have been forgotten, something truly unique: the last emperor of China, Aisin Gioro Puyi. As the last ruler of China&apos;s feudal dynasties, his line had stretched over 400 years, but he came to a very bitter end, all because the British neglected to add him to their collection. After being driven out of the Forbidden City he passed some unhappy time in Tianjin and north-eastern China before the Soviets grabbed him. Of course he was part of the Japanese collection for part of that time, but he was never satisfied with the price the Japanese had paid for him. In 1949 he was sent back to China, and underwent 10 years of Communist education at the Fushun War Crimes Re-education Centre. By the time he was granted pardon in 1959 Puyi was already 52 years old. He was introduced to an old maid, Li Shuxian, and the two were married. By this time the Party and government realised the importance of preserving the line of the dragon - which is to say they understood the importance of collecting - and they wished that the last emperor might produce an heir. Prime minister Zhou Enlai personally made inquiries into the matter but, sadly, Puyi was already impotent. New China&apos;s medical resources were terribly behind the times, and all they could think to do was give him hormone shots. After receiving the shots the emperor would go bounding home, but still it came to nothing - the more shots they gave him, the worse off he became. So the long line of Chinese emperors came to an end. If this had been Britain, I&apos;m sure they could have thought of something. While we&apos;re on the subject, Puyi himself was also something of a collector. He was a collector of a very particular sort. He, along with his brother Aisin Gioro Pujie, brazenly looted the collection of his forefathers from the Forbidden City. The exact numbers are hard to estimate, but the items included gifts from the British royal family to the Qing emperors. He lived by selling off these treasures, and when the time came to flee he threw away what he couldn&apos;t carry. He caused the ruin of very many items. Later he donated a great number to Stalin in the name of &quot;supporting the development of the Soviet economy&quot;; actually he was buying his own life. By the time he found himself in Fushun he still had three great leather chests full of treasures; of course every one of these was handed over to the nation. The government, mindful of his remaining days, allowed him to retain a single item for his personal use. Puyi chose nothing rare or priceless for himself, only a cheap gold-plated watch from France. It wasn&apos;t even a part of the Forbidden City collection, it was something he&apos;d bought from Ullmann &amp; Co in 1924, as he fled through Beijing from the Prince Chun Mansion to the Japanese embassy. Clearly he had lost interest in being a collector - perhaps he had already come to realise the dangers of the pursuit. A good collector would sell his soul to add to his collection; Puyi only thought to sell his collection in order to preserve his own skin. It&apos;s no surprise - the Chinese are actually no great collectors. They mostly love new things, the newer the better. In households throughout the countryside, the labour of a whole generation may be spent in tearing down an old home and replacing it with a new tile-roofed house. If a family is still living in the house of their ancestors it&apos;s a great loss of face. I&apos;ve heard that plenty of regular people in England are living in three- or four-hundred-year-old houses - good lord, they&apos;re practically living in the Forbidden City! The Chinese would never live in buildings like that - according to tradition, old buildings are haunted. Furthermore, the Chinese don&apos;t have the means for collection. We&apos;re a developing country- it may look like we&apos;ve got plenty of space and resources, but divide it all by a population of 1.3 billion and we&apos;ve barely got enough pairs of pants to go around. Everyone knows that China collects giant pandas, but this collection alone is a major strain on the national finances. To be honest, we can&apos;t actually afford the furry things. So the government encourages private citizens to adopt them - a friend of mine with plenty of money did it. He spent more than 200,000 yuan a year, but he couldn&apos;t even take the panda home, he was only permitted to have a commemorative photograph taken with it. This struck him as a bad deal, and he gave it up after the first year. To resolve the financial burden of their panda collection the Chinese came up with another idea - giving them away as gifts. The first chance they get, Chinese leaders will bestow a panda on other nations, particularly developed nations. The recipients are all tremendously grateful, because they know pandas are the national treasure of China. But in truth they&apos;ve been duped: they are obliged to put huge amounts of labour and resources into researching pandas and all their various needs. The Americans were the first to fall for it. Two years ago Mainland China tried to gift Taiwan with two cute pandas, &quot;Tuantuan&quot; and &quot;Yuanyuan&quot;, but the Taiwanese (who are also Chinese) were far too sharp, and saw right through the trick - they declined the gift. The British truly understand collecting, and they&apos;ve got the means to do it. They even collect human beings. They say that if you buy a cup of coffee and sit on the corner of Oxford Street, you can see people from more than 140 different countries. They&apos;ve got all colours, all faiths. The British government has to adjust its immigration policies every year in order to preserve the proper balance of races. Of course they also collect political dissidents. Any open, civilised society must maintain a certain quantity of political dissidents. The Dalai Lama has been part of the collection for many years, but it&apos;s time now to bring him out and put him on the auction block. In the past I&apos;ve also thought about trying to get on the list, and enjoy the status of being a collector&apos;s item. But really, being a political dissident is just too easy these days. A little criticism of current affairs, a little cursing of the government - to me it&apos;s both thrilling, and also perfectly safe. To be honest I&apos;d love to curse the Communist Party, but it&apos;s a bit late for that now. The Party has already wised up; they&apos;ve realised that allowing people to curse them without reprisal is a great display of their high-mindedness. The more you curse, the more enlightened they look. Christ, you might as well just start praising them. In the next 50 years, the prospects for political dissidence in China look very dim indeed. No one will bother collecting us, not even the oldest and grandest of the imperialist nations - Great Britain. When the British government decides it&apos;s time to do business with China, no one will give us a second thought. In the spring of 2008 I received an unexpected invitation to visit Britain. More than a decade ago I wrote a book called I Love Dollars. It was banned in China at the time, and was fairly well-known. If it hadn&apos;t been banned, I doubt whether it would have been quite so well-known. It&apos;s the story of a son who helps his father go through the streets looking for women - highly challenging to the traditional morality of the Chinese people. To be honest this book caused me a lot of problems because it was narrated in the first person, and critics and readers assumed it was autobiographical; my father and I both lost our reputations. Just when I was finally forgetting the whole thing, the English version of I Love Dollars was published in America and became quite popular, even garnering a nomination for an international literary prize. A British cultural organisation got my phone number from the British embassy in China, and asked me if I could write a book called I Love Pounds. If I was interested, they would pay my way for a trip to England. I didn&apos;t respond right away, first because of my unpleasant memories of I Love Dollars, second because I&apos;ve never taken writing lightly. The next day I went to the Beijing branch of the Bank of China to check that day&apos;s exchange rates, and saw that the British pound sterling was worth almost two American dollars! Who wouldn&apos;t love pounds? But even so I made no rash decisions - I only exchanged a few notes to take home with me. I exchanged a total of 85 pounds, one each of the 50, 20, 10 and five-pound denominations. Back home I laid these notes on my desk and stared for a long time at the image of the Queen. I asked myself if I were capable of any true feelings for this particular currency. One week later I had still experienced no emotion. I prepared my answer to the British: I&apos;m very sorry, I won&apos;t be able to write I Love Pounds, maybe you could try Ha Jin. The name of this Chinese writer, winner of the National Book Award in America, could be translated as &quot;Likes Money&quot;. I had picked up the phone and dialled a long string of numbers, and was waiting for the call to go through, when I suddenly noticed the 50-pound note, and a small line to the upper left of the Queen&apos;s head: I PROMISE TO PAY THE BEARER ON DEMAND THE SUM OF... I had the ghostly sensation that the Queen herself was speaking to me, in tones which, though lacking intimacy, removed all possibility of doubt. In that instant, I found my inspiration.

The official news agency, Xinhua, said Li Changjiang had stepped down with the approval of China&apos;s cabinet. His resignation follows the discovery of the industrial chemical melamine in milk and dairy products from China&apos;s three biggest dairy companies. Nearly 13,000 people remain in hospital after drinking milk products that contained melamine. Four children have died and more than 100 are seriously ill. Amid growing public outcry, Wen Jiabao, the Chinese premier, visited hospitals in Beijing over the weekend and threatened harsh punishment for the culprits. &quot;The public is worried, doctors are worried, and we&apos;re also worried,&quot; he said, according to Xinhua. &quot;What we are trying to do is to ensure no such event happens in future, by punishing those responsible. None of those companies lacking professional ethics or social morals will be let off. &quot;The most crucial point is that after a clean-up there can be no problems at all with newly produced milk products. If there are fresh problems, they must be even more sternly punished under the law.&quot; Melamine is used to make plastic and is high in nitrogen, which makes products appear to have a high protein count. It is thought some raw milk suppliers watered down their milk to boost the volume and then added melamine to disguise this. Ingesting small amounts of melamine is not thought to cause harm, but sustained consumption can cause kidney stones and renal failure, especially in children. Most of the victims are under two years old. The World Health Organisation today called for stricter monitoring of the industry after it emerged that Sanlu Group, China&apos;s biggest infant milk powder producer, knew of the problems with melamine for more than a month but the information was kept quiet while Beijing hosted the Olympics. Hans Troedsson, a WHO representative, said: &quot;It is important to know if information was withheld, where and why it was withheld. Was it ignorance by provincial authorities or was it that they neglected to report it? If it was ignorance there is a need to have much better training and education. If it is neglect then it is of course more serious.&quot; Japan, Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Taiwan are among Asian countries that have banned or recalled Chinese milk products.  Hong Kong is thought to have discovered its first victim: a three-year-old girl diagnosed with a kidney stone at the weekend. She had drunk two glasses a day of a high-calcium, low-fat milk product for more than a year. Other children in the territory are being tested. The government has promised free treatment for affected children, but parents are worried about long-term illness and doctors&apos; bills. The scandal is hurting dairy farmers. The Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing their cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. The ministry has promised them subsidies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/china.food", "publicationDate": "2008-09-22T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Kidney stones", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan banned all mainland dairy products on Sunday."], "title": "Head of watchdog resigns as number of babies in hospital from tainted milk rises to 13,000", "article": "     Almost 13,000 Chinese babies are in hospital after consuming tainted baby milk, and a further 40,000-plus have been treated, in a scandal which yesterday led to the resignation of the head of the country&apos;s quality watchdog, according to state media. The scandal, which began when dozens of babies suffered kidney stones and even kidney failure after drinking a popular brand that contained the chemical melamine, has since spread to more than 20 companies and affected products including fresh milk, yoghurt and ice-cream.  Countries across Asia are checking imported dairy products from China. Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong have already banned or recalled a variety of milk products. Taiwan banned all mainland dairy products on Sunday. In Hong Kong Nestl\u00e9, the world&apos;s largest food company, said it had recalled a UHT pure milk product after a local food watchdog discovered samples containing a tiny amount of the chemical melamine.  Worried Hong Kong parents also took their children for health checks, after the government announced that a three-year-old girl who had drunk a melamine-laced milk product had a kidney stone. She did not show serious symptoms and was discharged without medication or surgery. The Japanese government has asked 90,000 companies to check whether imports have been contaminated with melamine, and the country&apos;s Marudai Food Co has withdrawn buns made with milk supplied by one of the Chinese companies involved, Yili Industrial Group.  In China anxious parents are queueing at hospitals to have their babies examined. The government has promised free treatment, but some families are concerned about costs and long-term complications.  Four infants are believed to have died from the toxic formula and 104 are in serious condition, the health ministry said. It added that 1,500 had already left hospital and nearly 40,000 with milder symptoms had received clinical treatment and advice before going home. The ministry had previously reported that 6,200 children were ill, with 1,300 in hospital. It did not explain the sharp rise in numbers. The head of China&apos;s quality watchdog, Li Changjiang, stepped down with the approval of the cabinet, the state news agency Xinhua reported. His agency is responsible for ensuring that China&apos;s food supply chain is safe.  Premier Wen Jiabao threatened harsh punishment for culprits as he toured hospitals in Beijing. &quot;Although the ordinary people are very understanding, as the government we feel very guilty,&quot; he said, according to Xinhua. &quot;This event is a warning for all food safety.&quot;  The head of Sanlu, the company at the heart of the baby milk scandal, has already been arrested after being sacked. Several farmers have also been held. City officials in Shijiazhuang, where Sanlu is based, were also sacked, with a senior provincial official saying they knew of the problem for over a month without taking action - only telling Beijing once the Olympics were over. Melamine, often used to make plastics, artificially boosts apparent protein levels in tests. That creates an incentive for farmers producing substandard milk to add the substance. China&apos;s food quality watchdog has said it found melamine in nearly 10% of milk and drinking yoghurt samples from three dairy companies, Mengniu, Yili and the Bright group. To date, no illnesses have been reported from melamine in other dairy products. Tests on infant formula from other producers also found that while melamine was present in batches from a fifth of China&apos;s dairy producers, the levels were far lower than in the case of Sanlu.  But fear has spread rapidly among consumers, and the Chinese ministry of agriculture said despairing farmers were dumping milk and killing cattle after companies stopped buying their supplies. It promised subsidies to help struggling cattle farmers. Starbucks in China has started serving soya milk rather than dairy with its coffee. The government promised to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scandals which exposed corruption, bureaucratic inertia and cost-cutting producers.  But China&apos;s dairy producers face a crisis of confidence that will only be cured by strong action, said Lao Bing, manager of a Shanghai-based dairy investment company.  &quot;Consumers will start rebuying in a month or two if they feel sure the government is undertaking a vigorous clean-up,&quot; he told Reuters. &quot;Exports will take longer. This will have a major impact.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/enterprise/portable.computers", "publicationDate": "2008-09-24T13:59:48Z", "tags": ["Enterprise"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Asus got the market started a year ago, and more than a dozen suppliers have now piled in."], "title": "Portable computers: review", "article": "Small, cheap notebook computers are rapidly becoming the latest craze, because they are light, portable and incredibly handy to have around. My dentist has just asked me which one to buy, and my friend the driving instructor is already using an Asus Eee PC for roadside surfing via a mobile phone dongle. They&apos;re springing up all over. Taiwan&apos;s Asus got the market started a year ago, and more than a dozen suppliers have now piled in. Examples include Acer&apos;s Aspire One, Hewlett-Packard&apos;s Mini-Note 2133, MSI&apos;s Wind/Advent 4211 and Samsung&apos;s NC10. Dell has just started shipping the Inspiron Mini 9, and Lenovo, which makes IBM ThinkPads, has one on the way. So far we have not settled on a name, but they are called subnotebooks, netbooks, mini-books, and liliputers. Intel calls them MIDs (mobile internet devices). Microsoft calls them ULCPCs (ultra low-cost personal computers) and targets them with a cheap version of Windows XP. We&apos;ve had subnotebook computers for years, but sales didn&apos;t take off. Most were aimed at travelling businessmen or &quot;road warriors&quot; and prices often ranged between \u00a31,500 and \u00a32,500. Unless you really needed portability, you could buy a faster machine with a bigger screen for less. Netbooks have small keyboards and screens \u2014 between 18 and 26cm (seven and 10.2 inches), low-power processors, and may have no conventional drives at all: often they use Flash memory. They are small enough to fit in a manbag or handbag and only cost around \u00a3200-\u00a3300; they&apos;re almost an impulse buy. Gartner researchers reckon about 5m units will be sold this year, increasing to 8m next year. I think those are conservative numbers. Originally, netbooks were intended for schools, following the model of the OLPC (one laptop per child) project, and the competing Intel Classmate PC design. The Asus Eee PC 700 was launched in the UK by RM, a specialist schools IT supplier, but soon it seemed we all wanted one. Andee Hsu, European product manager for the Eee PC, says Asus designed the machine for families: &quot;You, me, the kids \u2014 everyone can have their own. We were able to reach customers we haven&apos;t reached before. Later, we also found out it was very good for business trips, and people were buying them as second PCs. Easy to use &quot;We also found that the seven-inch screen was a little too small for senior people, so now we have launched a 10-inch model with a bigger keyboard and a bigger screen,&quot; Hsu adds. &quot;Physically it&apos;s not much bigger and, as a senior person myself, I&apos;ve found it far easier to use.&quot; Dell is also targeting its new \u00a3299 Inspiron Mini 9 at consumers who want to use it for blogging, emails, watching BBC iPlayer and YouTube videos, and video-chat. Dell&apos;s European consumer product manager Adam Griffin says it&apos;s not aimed at business users. &quot;There&apos;s a clear differentiation between that and a value laptop that has a bigger screen, a lot more power, performance and hard drive space.&quot; (Dell&apos;s value notebook line, called Vostro, starts at a lower price than the Mini 9 netbook.) While it may not be a replacement for a full-spec portable, a netbook can still earn its keep. You can use one for email while travelling, where a bigger PC would be unwieldy. You can also browse the web at Wi-Fi hotspots. Although instant messaging, social networking (for example, Facebook) and blogging are seen as consumer applications, more and more businesses are using them. Online applications It&apos;s true that the Intel Atom \u2014 a tiny new processor designed for the MID market \u2014 does not have the raw power of a Celeron, Pentium or Core processor for running desktop applications, but many netbook owners use online applications instead. Gmail and Google Docs are obvious choices, but there are plenty more. Browser-based online applications are particularly important for people who have devices that don&apos;t run Windows, whether they&apos;re netbooks or mobile phones. Netbooks tend to offer a choice of either Windows XP (the HP 2133 runs Vista) or a variant of Linux. Although Linux has a reputation for being hard to use, netbooks come with simple front ends that make it very easy to run the built-in applications. However, it can be hard for non-geeks to replace or add to these, as I&apos;ve found. Usually, the preinstalled Linux applications are free, open-source programs such as the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email client, and OpenOffice suite. All these are available for Windows, too. However, programs such as Microsoft Office and Apple&apos;s iTunes are not available for Linux. If you need to run a particular application, or connect to another device such as a printer or a mobile phone dongle, check this is possible \u2014 or there&apos;s a substitute \u2014 before buying. Asus started out selling a Linux version of the Eee PC but now also offers Windows XP. Hsu says the initial response was that &quot;Linux is very complicated. Right now, with the second-PC customer, we find they adopt Windows better.&quot; It seems people tend to buy what they know. So, are netbooks good for business? It depends how you work. If you travel around, you might find you can get things done at times and in places where you would otherwise be unable to work. If so, a netbook can pay for itself in days. In my experience, netbooks are even more useful if you have a mobile broadband connection, not just Wi-Fi. It&apos;s no surprise that Vodafone plans to sell Dell Mini 9 netbooks with built-in mobile broadband in Vodafone stores. If you&apos;re a &quot;digital nomad&quot;, a netbook is more portable than a business notebook PC but more functional than a BlackBerry or similar smartphone. You may find it&apos;s just what you need."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/china.foodsafety", "publicationDate": "2008-09-24T14:22:32Z", "tags": ["China", "Food safety", "Tesco", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A Chinese official apologised to consumers in Taiwan as authorities there ordered China-made milk products and vegetable-based proteins off store shelves pending testing."], "title": "China milk scare reaches Britain as Tesco withdraws sweets", "article": "The scare over Chinese dairy products reached Britain today as Tesco announced it was removing milk sweets from its shelves as a precautionary measure. New Zealand authorities warned the White Rabbit brand contained &quot;unacceptable&quot; levels of melamine. At least twelve countries, from Indonesia to Kenya to Colombia, have now banned Chinese dairy imports amid fears sparked by tainted milk powder that has killed four Chinese babies and made tens of thousands ill, including five in Hong Kong and Macau. Around 100 are still in a serious condition. Several more countries have stepped up testing after melamine, which can cause kidney stones and even kidney failure, was found in products ranging from fresh milk to cakes and biscuits. The chemical, used in making plastics and fertiliser, should not be added to food - but boosts apparent protein levels in tests. So far all the cases of illness have been linked to infant formula from Sanlu, the company at the heart of the scandal. Products from other large dairy firms showed lower levels of the substance. A senior Chinese product safety official insisted that the problem was &quot;under control, more or less&quot; and Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking on a visit to New York, said the government would use the crisis as an opportunity to overhaul safety controls. &quot;There is no problem,&quot; Xiang Yuzhang, the national quality watchdog&apos;s chief inspection official, told reporters in Beijing. &quot;It has been brought under control, more or less. There are no more problems in the market.

New Zealand&apos;s Food Safety Authority warned they had found &quot;unacceptable&quot; contamination in the imported sweets. &quot;This product contains sufficiently high levels of melamine which may, in some individuals, cause health problems such as kidney stones,&quot; the authority&apos;s deputy chief executive, Sandra Daly, said in a statement. She urged people to seek medical advice if they or their children had eaten the sweets, adding: &quot;This is a serious concern.&quot; Singapore&apos;s Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority had already reported the presence of melamine. Bright Food Group, the manufacturer, told local media it was checking the product. Since the scandal first emerged two weeks ago, bans and checks have been introduced worldwide and have spread from dairy products to those that may contain milk. The European Union does not allow Chinese dairy imports but has already urged customs authorities to intensify checks on products such as bread and chocolate. A Chinese official apologised to consumers in Taiwan as authorities there ordered China-made milk products and vegetable-based proteins off store shelves pending testing. Indonesia warned that retailers face up to five years in jail and a \u00a3100,000 fine if they fail to remove from sale 28 products - including Oreo cookies and M&amp;Ms - until testing is completed. Kraft Foods said Oreo products do not contain any dairy from China, while Mars, maker of M&amp;Ms, said it does not use ingredients from China&apos;s blacklisted firms. Australia advised citizens overseas to avoid all Chinese-made milk products, unless companies have confirmed their goods are free from contamination, and the US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its sampling of Asian imports to dairy-based candies and desserts. Malaysia ordered safety inspections for many Chinese food imports, including those without milk. But Anthony Hazzard, a World Health Organization advisor on food security, said: &quot;I think the greatest fear is if there has been illegal movement of the heavily contaminated products rather than the legal movement of products that may have very low levels of melamine.&quot; The Chinese ministry of commerce has acknowledged that the milk food scandal had &quot;hurt the reputation of Chinese products&quot;, adding that producers and exporters will be subjected to stricter inspections. Four years ago Premier Wen apologised after the cover-up over Sars and the government promised to toughen safety regimes last year, after a spate of product scares. But Yang Fengchun of Peking University&apos;s school of government told the Associated Press news agency: &quot;Although after Sars, the government promised a more open media environment and to protect people&apos;s right of expression, without essential measures, it&apos;s just empty talk. What is really needed is to change the system&apos;s framework. &quot;The government and companies have lied to people, so it becomes very difficult to make people believe again in what they say.&quot; Hans Troedsson, WHO&apos;s representative in Beijing, warned: &quot;What needs to be stepped up is supervision, inspection and regulation at the local level.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/sep/25/yahoo.yahoo", "publicationDate": "2008-09-24T22:59:00Z", "tags": ["Yahoo", "Media", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Outside Europe, Yahoo has research centres in Haifa in Israel, Barcelona, Bangalore, Taipei, Taiwan and of course Sunnyvale in California, but also small centres in Brazil,Hong ong, Japan and Korea."], "title": "Yahoo Grenoble opens: roll out the purple carpet!", "article": "Calling all developers! City air starting to get to you? Cramped London flat, endless noise and a rapidly expanding waistline? Yahoo could have the answer... Formally launched today, Yahoo&apos;s new research and development centre at Grenoble, in south-east France, already employs 220 engineers and has now overtaken London as Yahoo&apos;s biggest European research centre. So just what did the UK miss out on when Yahoo chose to open in Grenoble? Grenoble has a significant heritage in the technology industry; Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard and Xerox are already here, and Yahoo itself came to Grenoble when it bought the shopping site Kelkoo four years ago. It likes to think of itself as the Silicon Valley of Europe. Today&apos;s official opening was marked with no small amount of fanfare - ribbon cutting and all - and an inauguration speech by Christine Lagarde, France&apos;s formidable minister for economy, industry and employment. Christine Lagarde, French minister for the economy, industry and employment She told a swooning audience of French journalists, local dignitaries and Yahoos about changes implemented by Sarkozy&apos;s government in employment law in the past few months that make it much easier for multinationals to take employ in France; that, and a tax credit for research business that gives 30% back to the company, effectively tripling research budgets. Lagarde also said it was time to move away from the stereotype of France as a country of people who take long holidays and eat good food: &quot;There is another France, and it is the one you have fallen in love with and invested in.&quot; In turn John Linwood, Yahoo&apos;s senior vice president for international engineering, said Lagarde represented a &quot;a new energy in France about encouraging investment and attracting multinational companies&quot;. &quot;We operate in a very competitive, multinational world,&quot; said Linwood. &quot;We do development all over the world, but it&apos;s important to find locations where we can find talent, work with the government and grow our business in an environment that is friendly to that. These changes have made it much more attractive as a company [to invest in France].&quot; Yahoo announced in March that it is shifting its European headquarters from London to Switzerland - a decision due, in no small part, to various tax advantages, as well as a general cost-saving drive following months of shareholder frustration about the company&apos;s flagging share price. Is this just the next phase of moving out of over-priced London? &quot;You can see a number of other companies are considering their position within the UK,&quot; said Tim O&apos;Donoghue, vice president for Yahoo engineering in Europe and Canada. &quot;A number have gone to Ireland and it&apos;s for those sort of reasons that the business looked at where best to locate the headquarters.&quot; Linwood added that Grenoble is not replacing London, and said a fifth of the staff there are still research based. &quot;We&apos;re not divesting from London. We have and continue to have a strong research presence there and if you look at our research centres they are magnets for all sorts of talent pools. You can&apos;t get it all in one location.&quot; &quot;There&apos;s a worldwide shortage of good tech talent,&quot; said Linwood. &quot;It&apos;s very difficult to attract and retain good talent, and that&apos;s not something unique to Yahoo but that happens to everyone. &quot;Worldwide the Yahoo strategy is to be in a number of places around the world where we can tap talent pools, looking at universities producing good graduates, actively partnering with universities, in Grenoble, for example, and working with them to help develop their curricula.&quot; The UK is strong on front end engineering and web development, media consumer internet and mobile, he said, while Grenoble is focusing on recommendation for Yahoo Answers, semantic search technology and the weighty service management that keeps Yahoo&apos;s services running. Yahoo Answers, which is a kind of question and answers tool with answers written and rated by users, has its research base at Grenoble. The service has 140 million users each month, Yahoo claims - more than the combined population of the UK and France. Answers has &quot;an aggressive roadmap of functionality,&quot; said O&apos;Donoghue, and will integrate research on user relevance and information from social networks that can help determine the most relevant information for a user. Linwood said that Brickhouse - Yahoo&apos;s California-based concept incubator project and home of Fire Eagle - is in the process of being &quot;reinvented&quot;, but said the favoured way of prioritising new projects is to identify a business need and ask teams to brainstorm prototypes that would solve those. Outside Europe, Yahoo has research centres in Haifa in Israel, Barcelona, Bangalore, Taipei, Taiwan and of course Sunnyvale in California, but also small centres in Brazil,Hong ong, Japan and Korea. What Grenoble offers is an existing tech community and a huge community of science and technology students; they account for more than 60,000 of Grenoble&apos;s wider population of around 250,000. London might be strong on mobile and creative web development, but can it match that combination of talent, tax breaks and quality of life? It doesn&apos;t seem to matter where in the world developers are; the language of the web - not to mention the Yahoo-branded desk detritus, in-geek joke screen savers and table football - is pretty international. That said, there aren&apos;t many offices where it&apos;s quite normal to fit in a snowboarding session before work. \u2022 Coming shortly: audio interview with Tim O&apos;Donoghue."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/25/foodsafety.children", "publicationDate": "2008-09-24T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Food safety", "Tesco", "Business", "China", "UK news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A Chinese official apologised to consumers in Taiwan as authorities there ordered Chinese-made milk products and vegetable-based proteins off store shelves pending testing."], "title": "Milk-based products pulled from sale as China scare spreads", "article": "The scare over Chinese dairy products reached Britain yesterday as Tesco announced it was removing milk sweets from its shelves as a precautionary measure.

Republicans and Democrats will come together and pass a substantial rescue plan. &quot;Our proposal is a big proposal because we have a big problem,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to move quickly.&quot; Gordon Brown added his backing to the rescue deal. Speaking in New York today, he also called for regulators to work across borders to prevent future crises. &quot;In the short term, each country is taking action to deal with the fallout of the credit crunch,&quot; the prime minister said. &quot;And America deserves support from the rest of the world as it seeks to agree in detail what all parties have agreed in principle.&quot; In a change to his original schedule, Brown will fly to Washington later for an emergency meeting with Bush on the global financial crisis. Shares in London slumped by more than 140 points at one stage while the Dow Jones plunged 150 points within the first few minutes of trading, but had clawed back some of its losses by 2pm EDT. The FTSE 100 closed 108.55 points lower at 5088.47. The price of gold - seen as a safe haven investment in turbulent times - surged by $38 to $920.1 an ounce, a 4.3% increase.  The Bush administration&apos;s rescue plan for the financial sector has stalled amid increasingly acriminious talks between the government and US Congress.  It had been thought last night that lawmakers were close to a final agreement on the bail-out, but an emergency White House meeting between congressional leaders and Bush &quot;devolved into a contentious shouting match&quot;, according to a statement from the John McCain campaign. The meeting was attended by the two presidential candidates, McCain and Barack Obama. Republicans balked at treasury secretary Henry Paulson&apos;s proposal to buy bad debts from banks and instead floated an alternative mortgage insurance plan. Markets were also spooked by  the overnight collapse of Washington Mutual, the country&apos;s largest savings and loans company in America&apos;s biggest banking failure. Oil prices were hit by the uncertainty over the bail-out package, with US crude falling $3 to $105 a barrel. The yen jumped by more than 1% against the dollar as investors rushed to buy the safe haven currency. The dollar fell to \u00a5105.26. &quot;This financial version of &apos;deal or no deal&apos; is not conducive to restoring badly-needed confidence,&quot; said Martin Slaney, head of derivatives at GFT. &quot;The ongoing discord is massively unsettling and the fact that we now have Washington Mutual added to the list of casualties is escalating the cynicism. If a deal hasn&apos;t been signed and sealed over the weekend, expect massive market turmoil. Monday will be a bloodbath.&quot;  Gordon Brown travels to Washington today for emergency talks on the financial crisis with Bush. Bush warned in a televised address to the nation Wednesday night that &quot;our entire economy is in danger&quot; if the bail-out package does not go ahead. &quot;Without immediate action by Congress, America can slip into a major panic,&quot; he said. To add to the gloom, revised data showed the US economy grew less quickly than had been thought in the second quarter of the year, meaning it carried less momentum into this current period of financial chaos. The Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at an annualised pace of 2.8% and not 3.3% as it estimated a month ago. Coming on top of bad unemployment, housing sales and durable goods orders data yesterday, the latest figures increased fears that the US could be heading into recession now that the temporary stimulus of the government&apos; tax cuts earlier this year is fading. In Britain, the country&apos;s biggest bank HSBC is laying off 1,100 people worldwide - 4% of its global investment banking operations - including 500 in the UK. Central banks stepped up their efforts today to ease the unprecedented strains in the banking system and calm markets. The European Central Bank, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank announced a new plan to pump in billions of dollars of one-week loans for the first time. &quot;Central banks continue to work together closely and are prepared to take further steps as needed to address the ongoing pressure in funding markets,&quot; they said. The ECB said it would lend $35bn for one week while the SNB offered $9bn. The BoE said it was switching $30bn of funds it had been offering overnight to one-week funds and offered another \u00a340bn in medium-term funds &quot;to address funding pressures over quarter-end&quot;. The Bank&apos;s first three-month auction will be held on Monday. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, said: &quot;This is a huge step forward and reflects the fact that credit markets have almost totally seized up over the last week and half.&quot; With commercial banks reluctant to lend to each other and hoarding cash, the Fed expanded its foreign exchange swaps facilities with the ECB and the SNB to pump money into the banking system. A week ago, the world&apos;s leading central banks - the Fed, BoE, ECB, Bank of Japan, SNB and Bank of Canada took coordinated action to provide $180bn (\u00a3100bn) in extra liquidity. Federal regulators closed WaMu in the early hours and seized its assets, then sold much of the company to JP Morgan Chase for $1.9bn. The deal will create the largest bank in the country, ahead of Bank of America. It is the second time the authorities have called on JP Morgan after the investment bank took over Bear Stearns in a rescue orchestrated by the US Federal Reserve in March.  Customers have rushed to take their money out of WaMu, which has suffered $16.7bn of deposit withdrawals in the past fortnight. The firm - the equivalent of a British building society - held $188bn in deposits as of June, far more than any US bank that has ever failed.  WaMu, which was founded in Seattle in 1889, has seen its share price virtually wiped out after it made thousands of mortgage loans that its borrowers cannot repay, saddling it with billions of dollars in bad debts. All Asian stock markets slid, with Japan&apos;s Nikkei closing down 0.94%. Taiwan&apos;s stockmarket fell 2.16% while Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was down 1.33%. In Europe, Germany&apos;s Dax and France&apos;s CAC both dropped by 2%."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/28/globalrecession.useconomicgrowth", "publicationDate": "2008-09-27T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Global recession", "US economic growth and recession", "Market turmoil", "Business", "US news"], "sentences": ["And as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were failing, Americans looked on and observed that such endemic economic troubles only happened in developing economies such as Asia and Latin America, and could never happen in their great nation."], "title": "$700bn won't save America from a slump", "article": "There is a simple reason why US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson&apos;s $700bn bail-out package has been so hard to sell to politicians and the American people: it won&apos;t really work. Despite the historically massive expenditure and all the little clauses to make sure Wall Street fat cats get their comeuppance, the plan is unlikely to do anything to save the world&apos;s biggest economy from a long and crippling downturn. It will doubtless save some banks from collapse, but is that worth the government putting itself on the hook for nearly a trillion dollars - more than $3,000 for every man, woman and child in America? And that&apos;s not the half of it. Not bailing out Wall Street - with as much money as it would take to launch an American National Health Service - presents an even bleaker prospect: a financial nuclear winter that could last a generation. In short, America is doomed if it does and even more doomed if it doesn&apos;t get Paulson&apos;s billions, perhaps the ugliest economic choice it has ever faced. You can always rely on &apos;Neutron Jack&apos; Welch, the former GE boss and all-round tough talker, to tell it how it is. &apos;I now believe we are in for one hell of a deep downturn,&apos; he told the World Business Forum in New York last Wednesday, adding that the first quarter of 2009 will be &apos;brutal&apos;. Until recently, Welch said, he had believed the American economy could avoid recession, but he has changed his mind, despite the bail-out. &apos;I am now caving,&apos; he said. &apos;Get ready for real tough times. They&apos;re coming.&apos; Welch is not alone in his gloomy outlook. A day after the New York meeting, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the German finance minister, predicted America will soon be knocked off its perch as the world&apos;s leading economic superpower. If you peel away this hyperbole, however, and consider the ramifications of such large-scale government intervention into the market as Paulson&apos;s bail-out represents, even Steinbr\u00fcck&apos;s seemingly gratuitous slight sounds plausible. The first question anyone thinking about the bail-out should surely ask is whether $700bn is enough, or indeed too much, to fix things. And where did that figure come from? David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, the New York credit rating agency, suggests that all the &apos;level 3&apos; assets of all the biggest financial firms on Wall Street adds up to about $630bn. But this valuation is arbitrary at best, seeing as these sub-prime or toxic securities are only really worth what the market - or in this case the US Treasury Department - is willing to pay for them. &apos;I think the biggest risk to the financial system is if it turns out to be not enough,&apos; says Barry Bosworth, a former economic adviser to President Carter and a senior economist at The Brookings Institution, a left-leaning Washington think-tank. It is impossible to know how much money will be needed to mop up all of America&apos;s sub-prime- related securitised debt because we don&apos;t yet know how the Treasury intends to go about buying it. &apos;There is so little agreement on this point - on whether it should be a traditional auction or a reverse auction or some other process - that the whole structure could very well fracture,&apos; Bosworth says. &apos;There is not enough detail.&apos;  And the seemingly flawed mechanics of the bail-out are just the tip of the iceberg. Assuming the plan actually gets off the ground and the Treasury is able to organise some kind of workable asset sale, what will happen to the US economy once the banks have been &apos;saved&apos;? Will house prices automatically start to stabilise? Will jobs be created as if by magic? Will Americans suddenly find they have disposable income on hand to get their consumer-weighted economy whirring away again? Of course not. And that is the plan&apos;s biggest flaw. &apos;My biggest fear is that all of this money, and it really is a very large amount, is going to be spent and none of it will be used to stimulate the economy,&apos; Bosworth says. In fact it is entirely possible that the economy will become even more paralysed after the bail-out than it is today, because the government will put such a strain on the already-creaking public finances that it will not be in a position to provide any sort of stimulus for a long time to come. America will be unable to spend its way out of this crisis. Most critics of Paulson&apos;s plan express concern over US taxpayers shelling out billions of dollars to bail out greedy Wall Street bankers, but this is a misconception. Taxpayers, who have been shocked by the scale of earnings of all-too-fallible &apos;masters of the universe&apos; such as Lehman Brothers&apos; Dick Fuld and Bear Stearns&apos; Jimmy Cayne (see panel) are not directly paying for this; nor will they ever, because America does not have $700bn of taxpayers&apos; money. The government is in debt to the tune of $9.8 trillion. The entire sum will probably be borrowed from foreign governments and other purchasers of US Treasury bonds - which creates further problems. &apos;Borrowing every penny of this $700bn could have very serious consequences,&apos; Bosworth says. &apos;Firstly, investors from other countries are going to see this as the biggest example yet of America&apos;s lack of financial discipline. They may then very well decide they should not invest so heavily here and diversify their portfolios to invest less in US Treasuries, dollars and US equities and more in European bonds and the euro.&apos; This, of course, will drive the already weakened dollar down even further, which will not only suck more lifeblood out of the American economy but drive up the dollar-denominated price of oil and other commodities, adding inflationary pressure into the bargain. Talk about kicking a country while it is down. Vincent Reinhart is a senior economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank normally the antithesis of Brookings and its liberal scholars. He is in a particularly good position to criticise Paulson and Fed chairman Ben Bernanke&apos;s latest work because he worked for the Federal Reserve for more than 25 years, much of it as a director on the monetary affairs board. On the subject of the bail-out, however, he agrees almost entirely with Bosworth. In fact he goes even further, suggesting that what has been dubbed &apos;Tarp&apos; (the Troubled Asset Relief Programme) will all but cripple whoever wins the presidential election in November. &apos;Who would want to be President and inherit this mess?&apos; Reinhart asks, adding that most of the big decisions in the victor&apos;s entire four-year term will be made by the Bush administration before inauguration day in January. &apos;The whole four years will likely be bogged down in very dull financial regulation and legislation relating to this bill.&apos; What is more, with such immense pressure on public finances from the size of the debt incurred to fund it, Barack Obama can forget about spending increases and John McCain won&apos;t have any room for tax cuts. So whoever wins will be unable to fulfil many of their manifesto pledges. The next President will also face the prospect of a global depression to manage, and with it the possibility of strained relations with foreign governments. China, so dependent on the US as top buyer of its manufactured goods, faces an abrupt slowdown as Americans tighten their belts. This of course will mean that China and other nations will be less able to purchase huge wads of US Treasuries even if they wanted to, further restricting America&apos;s access to funds. &apos;It certainly will change our relationship with our trading partners,&apos; Reinhart says. It is almost as if Paulson and Bernanke have created a plan that will see them through the next few months without concern for the long-term effects of their actions. &apos;I regard this as nothing more than a stopgap measure to get us through the election,&apos; says S&amp;P&apos;s Wyss. After the Latin American financial crisis in the 1980s, the leading countries of Asia and the Pacific Rim said such a collapse could never happen to them. But in just a few years their economies were falling like dominoes. And as Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were failing, Americans looked on and observed that such endemic economic troubles only happened in developing economies such as Asia and Latin America, and could never happen in their great nation. They were wrong."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/29/cadburyschweppes.china", "publicationDate": "2008-09-29T10:14:02Z", "tags": ["Cadbury", "Business", "China", "World news", "Kidney stones", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The recalled products \u2013 which include eclairs and Dairy Milk \u2013 were manufactured in the Chinese capital Beijing and sold in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan."], "title": "Cadbury recalls 11 products from sale in China as tainted milk scandal grows", "article": "The British chocolate maker Cadbury today said it was recalling 11 product ranges from sale in China as the country&apos;s tainted milk scandal continued to grow.

John McCain will beat Barack Obama on November 4, but serve only one term. In consequence the next presidential contest in the United States will be fought between Vice-President Sarah Palin and Senator Hilary Clinton. No, I don&apos;t believe it either. Too much is now changing too fast in our world for any safe prediction \u2013 this one came from Francis Maude MP \u2013 to be made about how things will be in 2012.  When &quot;Nuclear Jack&quot; Welch, the tough old boot who masterminded General Electric (GE) for years decides \u2013 as he did the other day \u2013 that this is the Big One, we had all better fasten our seatbelts. Put it another way, my old Guardian colleague, Simon Winchester, now a highly-successful, US-based author \u2013 Krakatowa, The Doctor of Crowthorne etc - likes to tell the story of how he lectured in New York on the coming perils of global warning, explaining how rising levels of the world&apos;s oceans may drown us all.  &quot;Well, not New York of course,&quot; someone in the audience observed. Yes, New York too. Not quite the flood Winchester predicted, but it may now be happening. Back to Birmingham, the presidency and the Tory conference. There&apos;s a building they&apos;ve dubbed &quot;the freedom zone&quot; behind the main conference hall. It&apos;s where the libertarian right is parading its views, possibly unaware that our fast-changing world is making many such views a bit of a luxury. This morning a group called the &quot;DC Tories&quot; \u2013 ie Brits who live in Washington \u2013 got a couple of senior American backroom types to debate the relative merits of Senators McCain and Obama, with Ed Cox (Richard Nixon&apos;s son-in-law) for the Republicans, and Bill Barnard (an ex-professor at Oxford) for the Democrats. In truth, both were rather safe and dull. The two Tory MPs who had attended the two conventions, Brooks Newmark for McCain and Francis Maude at what he admitted was the &quot;brilliant&quot; Obama launch in Denver, were both much livelier. US politics tends to the earnest these days: it has done them little good lately. Anyway Cox argued that on the key issues - freedom, opportunity, accountability, limited government and a strong defence \u2013 his man has a long and solid track record while Obama does not.  The world is a far more dangerous place than it was in the early 90s, he added. Putin, not Yeltsin, Hizbullah and Hamas, not the Oslo Accords, a near-nuclear Iran, Danny Ortega back in power in Nicaragua, another ally for that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Oh yes, and China on the rise. Not yet a world power, but an economic power in east Asia (they still don&apos;t get it, these guys do they?), it is in a position to tail the US Seventh Fleet, which protects Taiwan. If the Chinese CP senses its power ebbing it will play the nationalist card against Taiwan, he said. Good point, though he didn&apos;t say what he thinks the US will be able to do about it.  McCain understands this stuff and made a brave stand in favour of the US military &quot;surge&quot; which has stablised Iraq \u2013 even George Bush was initially against it. He didn&apos;t mention him by name, Bush&apos;s name barely featured at all. Bill Barnard should have made short work of all that, but he was a bit flat. He agreed about priorities, but said the Democrats had a better record on all of them. Didn&apos;t mention Obama too much either, now I reflect on it.  McCain&apos;s record deserved respect, but wasn&apos;t any where near as good as claimed. He seems obsessed with process, not with substance. On the two issues where he&apos;s broken with his party on substance \u2013 the amnesty for illegal immigrants and carbon emissions \u2013 he has been forced to backtrack. Since Cox had made much of McCain&apos;s judgment, Barnard retaliated by saying that a man of 72 with skin cancer problems who picked Sarah Palin as his running mate when he barely knew her was not a man whose judgment voters should trust. Alaska looks big, but it has just 700,000 citizens \u2013 &quot;less than Birmingham&quot;, he pointed out. As for Obama&apos;s tax-and-spend instincts, his tax cut for 95% of taxpayers could be funded simply by reversing the Bush tax cuts for the very rich \u2013 so great had those cuts been. As I suggested earlier, those sort of exchanges are way out of whack with reality as it is emerging on Wall St, Main St and New St Birmingham, which has five building society offices in a row. Brooks Newmark, MP for Braintree and himself a City figure, weighed in behind McCain and said: &quot;I love Sarah Palin.&quot;  Why? Because she is a change candidate, a small town mayor who took on her party&apos;s establishment and became governor. All right, she&apos;s a Christian fundamentalist who kept her own Down&apos;s baby and made her pregnant 17-year-old daughter marry the boy and keep their baby. Easy to mock in Europe, but up to 150 million Americans think the same way. That is true \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 and it is a sobering thought. Francis Maude called Obama &quot;a formidable performance artist&quot; whose Denver acceptance speech he would long remember. Studiously neutral as to his own preference (many Tories favour Obama) he agreed that the next president should engage better with the world - and that either will do that. Unusually, both are change candidates, both outsiders. Two interesting details I&apos;d not heard before.  One: Barnard said that McCain wanted Senator Joe Lieberman, the ex-Dem independent from Connecticut who ran with Al Gore in 2000, to be his running-mate. But he was warned it would split the convention and provoke walk-outs. So he took Palin after a brief meeting. Two: Cox said that George Bush had a very optimistic view of the prospects for democracy in 2001 \u2013 &quot; very Rousseau-ian,&quot; he said, not a label you hear much. So did Condi Rice. After her experience with Yeltsin&apos;s Russia they both thought that, if you got rid of the bad guys, democracy would take root easily.  &quot;You Brits, with your experience of the world, know better.&quot; The audience liked that, of course. Did anyone land a killer blow? No, but they agreed it is a remarkable election."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/china", "publicationDate": "2008-09-29T16:45:38Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Chocolate", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A spokesman for Cadbury said preliminary tests had shown traces of the substance in chocolates made in Beijing and sold in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan."], "title": "Cadbury's latest to recall products in Chinese milk scare", "article": "British confectionary company, Cadbury, has recalled Chinese-made chocolate after finding it contained melamine, as the scandal over tainted milk continued to develop.

The media have been saying things like, &quot;as long as she doesn&apos;t seem like a total idiot, she&apos;ll win.&quot; But I don&apos;t think that&apos;s right. I actually believe that substance matters in these forums a little more than that. One of the reasons Barack Obama beat John McCain in their first debate is that many viewers found him more substantive than they&apos;d figured him to be. Whether they can remember specific things he said isn&apos;t the point. It&apos;s that he came across as knowledgeable.  So put it this way if you like: command of substance is a form of performance. A candidate could not get up there and, however charismatically and empathically, read from the St. Louis telephone directory. You have to know something. So the standard she needs to meet is this: She can&apos;t seem like the student who gets up to give a book report who clearly hasn&apos;t read the book. Every American knows that type. Every American was that type, in one English class or another. &quot;Jean Valjean was this, uh, guy, who, uh, one day, and it was a nice, summer day\u2026&quot; People know when someone&apos;s faking it. In the Alaska gubernatorial debate clips I&apos;ve watched, Palin was fine to good. But she was comfortable with that material, which she&apos;d dealt with as a mayor and a state commissioner. But now, it&apos;s quite obvious that she hadn&apos;t given 10 minutes thought to national or international affairs before she was plucked. She&apos;s been studying for three weeks.  In three weeks, how much can one learn about the credit crisis, the trade imbalance, the financing of the Social Security system, the solvency of the Medicare trust fund, the impact of WTO regulations on American manufacturers, the latest research on carbon sequestration at coal plants, the auto makers&apos; pension problems, telecommunications policy and the lack of broadband, the path-to-citizenship question, the Syria-Lebanon situation, the India-Pakistan dispute, the Chinese connection to Africa and Latin America, the Mahdi Army, the matter of Taiwan, the concerns about military preparedness, the history of the Geneva Conventions and loose nukes? I&apos;ve just listed 17 issues areas. I could list 117. A legitimate question could be asked in a debate about any of them. Some questions will be predictable, and Palin will be able to fall back on rehearsed boilerplate. But some won&apos;t be. And if she can&apos;t talk with some degree of, if not actual knowledge, then at least persuasively fake pseudo-knowledge about, say, India and Pakistan then she might as well have gone up on stage naked. Substance does matter.  Joe Biden. Obviously, Biden could talk for five days straight about 117 areas of policy. Which suggests his first challenge: Don&apos;t. Keep it short. Aside from that, he has two main jobs. First and by far most important, don&apos;t condescend. Don&apos;t show off. There will presumably be moments when it&apos;s embarrassingly evident that she is talking gibberish. He can&apos;t smile or snicker (remember, Joe: split-screen camera).  He must take her seriously even \u2013 especially \u2013 when she least deserves it. He can&apos;t spend the whole evening correcting her. No: &quot;In fact, governor, let me explain that the details of that legislation were as follows\u2026&quot; Yes: &quot;Well, if I&apos;m remembering correctly, I think that bill was actually more directed at trying to\u2026&quot; Second: Palin will attack, attack, attack, both him and Obama. She&apos;ll be trying to goad him into being unchivalrous. Biden has to avoid the trap and fend these off forcefully but politely. Both these tasks require emotional restraint; a state of zen coolness. Biden should prepping for this debate not by rehearsing lines but by doing yoga. Gwen Ifill. The mini-controversy of the last 24 hours may have the effect of forcing Ifill, one of America&apos;s best television journalists, to censor herself and strike from her question list one or two of the tougher questions she had ready for Palin. Ifill needs to stand her ground. In a case like this, it&apos;s the precise crafting of the questions that matters. Questions have to be phrased in just the right way so that they demand that the answerer bring some knowledge to bear on the issue, while at the same time they don&apos;t cross the line into being too clever by half. Also they can&apos;t be too open-ended, because open-ended questions just let the person fling b.s. around. Too open-ended: &quot;Governor, give us your thoughts on telecommunications policy and how to expand broadband.&quot; Too clever: &quot;Governor, expound if you will on the comparative merits of the broadband policies of the United States, South Korea, Taiwan and Estonia.&quot; Just right: &quot;Governor, many people think the 1996 telecommunications act hasn&apos;t fostered broadband growth at a rate that it could have. What changes would you recommend to that act?&quot; That&apos;s a fair question. It doesn&apos;t demand that she be an expert on policy, but it does fairly demand that she know a little something about one of the most important pieces of legislation passed in the 1990s and have some basic ideas about the issue.  The other thing Ifill shouldn&apos;t do is give Palin opportunities to correct some of the idiotic things she&apos;s said over the last few days. In a new Katie Couric segment released yesterday, Palin affirmed that she saw a right to privacy in the Constitution. That&apos;s a dreadful error from the perspective of the so-called pro-life movement. Ifill shouldn&apos;t just ask her something like, &quot;Do you want to clarify your views on privacy and the Constitution?&quot; She&apos;ll have been coached for that.  Assuming there are no big historic moments, I suspect that this debate won&apos;t end up mattering that much. Most Americans think John McCain made an irresponsible choice, and most Americans will still think that the morning after election day."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/nokia.nokia", "publicationDate": "2008-10-02T16:50:22Z", "tags": ["Nokia", "Google", "Business", "Technology"], "sentences": ["T-Mobile, for instance, has already snapped up the G1 handset - which is made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC - for the UK market, while Vodafone is understood to have signed a deal to take the first touchscreen Blackberry device - called the Storm - which is due to be unveiled this side of the Atlantic next week."], "title": "Nokia takes on the iPhone with the 5800 XpressMusic", "article": "     Nokia has hit back in its fight against Apple and Google with the unveiling of its first touchscreen device and news that its unlimited mobile music service will launch in the UK in two weeks&apos; time. The new touchscreen handset, called the 5800 XpressMusic, is a direct response by the world&apos;s largest mobile phone maker to the threat posed by Apple&apos;s iPhone and the new G1 device, which uses Google&apos;s Android software and will be launched by T-Mobile in the UK next month. The Finnish company&apos;s Comes With Music service, meanwhile, is designed to challenge the dominance of iTunes in digital music and lure consumers away from illegal music sharing sites by offering them free access to millions of tracks. The first device that includes Comes With Music - the 5310 XpressMusic phone - will go on sale in the UK on October 16 and cost \u00a3129.95. It is designed for the pre-pay market and buyers will be able to slot their existing SIM card into it.  Nokia hopes the handset will be a big Christmas hit with parents who have become increasingly worried about their kids using illegal music sharing sites. The price includes a year&apos;s unlimited access to over 5m music tracks from the big four music companies and a handful of independent labels. While that is fewer tracks than the more than 8m available on iTunes, after a year Nokia Comes With Music users get to keep all the tracks they have downloaded - although they will only play on the computer to which they were downloaded or the Nokia phone. Consumers can still buy individual tracks after a year, but to get unlimited access they need to buy a new Nokia Comes With Music device. The device is just the latest unlimited mobile music service. UK-based music specialist Omnifone already has an unlimited service called MusicStation Max and the company is also behind the recent launch of another unlimited service from Sony Ericsson, called PlayNow Plus. Nokia intends to add the 5800 and its existing N95 to the range of Comes WIth Music devices over the next few months. But both of these phones are more expensive than the 5310 and more suited to the contract market, which means Nokia has to find a mobile phone operator willing to subsidise the handset. The 5800, for instance, has a retail price of \u20ac279 (\u00a3218) but that does not include a Comes With Music subscription. Nokia is still in talks with a number of mobile phone operators about taking its new touchscreen phone but the mobile phone companies are worried that the Finnish handset maker is encroaching on their turf with services such as Comes With Music. T-Mobile, for instance, has already snapped up the G1 handset - which is made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC - for the UK market, while Vodafone is understood to have signed a deal to take the first touchscreen Blackberry device - called the Storm - which is due to be unveiled this side of the Atlantic next week. O2, meanwhile, is the exclusive network partner in the UK for Apple&apos;s iPhone. In time for Christmas? Nokia&apos;s first full touchscreen device will not be its last. Jo Harlow, the company&apos;s senior vice president, marketing said: &quot;This is only one of a portfolio of touch enabled devices that you will see from Nokia. Here we are focusing on music and entertainment and touch really enables that. You will see other devices from us that focus on different segments and different needs that touch enables as well.&quot; The 5800 will start shipping later this year and Nokia is hoping it will be available in the UK in time for Christmas. But the company, which makes four out of every ten mobile phones sold worldwide, is not looking to ape Apple and do an exclusive deal with just one operator. &quot;This will be available in all operators, we are not looking at limiting the availability,&quot; she said.The device has the look and feel of the iPhone. Like the Apple device, rotating it causes the screen to switch from portrait to landscape and double clicking on a web page causes it to zoom in. But unlike the iPhone, the camera on the 5800 can take videos, at near film-like 25 frames a second &quot;which for the YouTube generation is great for being able to record video and upload it directly&quot;, according to Harlow. The battery life of the device is also better than both the iPhone and the G1.  The 5800 and G1 share some characteristics such as tactile feedback. Pressing on an icon causes the phone to vibrate slightly, this is particularly useful when using the qwerty keypad on the touchscreen as it makes it easier to judge which key is being depressed. The keys also change colour when pressed. The G1, of course, has its own full keypad which slides out from under the device, an added extra that makes it the largest of the three rival touchscreen phones."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/02/manufacturing.wolfson.electronics", "publicationDate": "2008-10-02T18:00:00Z", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Business", "iPhone", "Technology sector", "Technology", "Apple"], "sentences": ["Wolfson designs and develops around 100 different semi-conductor products but has them manufactured by third parties in Taiwan and China."], "title": "iPhone chip firm Wolfson hit by falling sales", "article": "Plunging sales of mobile phones, digital cameras and satellite navigation systems as a result of the credit crunch and high street slowdown will slice up to 20% off end-of-year revenues at Wolfson Microelectronics.

Frozen Yorkshire puddings, on the other hand, have been in short supply in Shanghai. That changed yesterday morning when Marks and Spencer opened the doors of its first store on the Chinese mainland. They closed again minutes later, as customers eager for their first glimpse of a 124-year-old British institution threatened to overwhelm the four-floor emporium on fashionable Nanjing West Road. But with 370 sq metres (4,000 sq ft) of retail space, queuing expatriate and Chinese consumers soon had their chance to stock up on rich tea biscuits and cotton socks. &quot;It&apos;s the moment I&apos;ve been waiting for,&quot; said business consultant Paul McCarthy, grabbing a 49 yuan (\u00a34) fish and chips ready meal and lauding the firm&apos;s rhubarb crumble. While homesick Brits are a boon to the business, the company&apos;s real target is the fast-expanding Chinese middle class. The shop is M&amp;S&apos;s largest in Asia and the first step in an ambitious plan to open 50 mainland stores within a few years. &quot;There are 1.3 billion people here. If one in eight of the Chinese population ends up wearing M&amp;S knickers, we will be very happy and our shareholders will be happier,&quot; said Carl Leaver, the company&apos;s international strategy director. One squint at the group&apos;s grim second-quarter trading figures underlined the importance of success here. &quot;We didn&apos;t start planning this when the domestic market was challenging; it&apos;s part of a long-term plan to grow our international business,&quot; said Leaver, pointing out that M&amp;S has almost 300 stores in 40 countries, with expansion planned from India to the Balkans. &quot;[But] this means our earnings over a period of time are less affected by any single market.&quot; The company has made few concessions to Chinese customers; each of the 5,000 general merchandise and 1,000 food lines can be bought at its Marble Arch branch in London. But clothing is skewed towards smaller sizes and mainland customers at the company&apos;s 10 Hong Kong stores have offered other valuable hints in tailoring the range. For her: confectionery and savoury snacks. For him: cotton polo shirts. Biscuits and pasta proved universally popular yesterday, though clothing scored more highly with older women than fashion-forward shoppers. Clutching a box of cherry liqueur chocolates, Chen Shuhao praised the food range and the company&apos;s heritage. But the 19-year-old student - sporting skinny cardigan, Converse trainers and a diamante-buckle belt - could see little to add to his wardrobe as he gazed through bug-eye glasses. &quot;It&apos;s more for white-collar workers,&quot; he observed. Li Rui, who works in advertising, judged the fashion mediocre. &quot;Menswear is okay but with women&apos;s the sizes are too big and the style too mature for 20-30-year-olds,&quot; he said. Another shopper said that the company&apos;s famed underwear included too few padded bras for Chinese women, who appreciate more support than their European sisters. Richard Sweet, managing director in China, accepted that Shanghai was &quot;awash&quot; with clothing stores and European brands, but he was confident that innovation - from machine-washable cashmere to GM-free snacks - would help the firm stand out. So too should service and quality, maximising the &quot;halo effect&quot; of the brand&apos;s origins. &quot;In China an element of Britishness is being trusted - being seen as honourable people who do what we say,&quot; he added. &quot;British packaged foods have premium quality compared to Chinese foods,&quot; confirmed Zhang Ailing, as she inspected a haddock pie. &quot;I&apos;d like to visit Britain one day and now we have a British store I can get a sliver of British style here. My family has a pretty good income so I prefer to have a premium life style.&quot; Sweet said that Shanghai customers demand good prices as well as quality. Although 30% of the non-food lines are made in China, most have to be re-imported for licensing reasons. The firm is absorbing the ensuing taxes to generate volume and position itself as a mid-market retailer. That sacrifice does not guarantee success. An earlier venture in Taiwan failed and shareholders will be crossing their fingers for growth here as the credit crunch hits Europe. But as Rita Hayworth once observed, you need more than luck in Shanghai. &quot;Today I&apos;m a hero, but it&apos;s ephemeral fame,&quot; acknowledged Sweet. &quot;Let&apos;s see what this store is doing on day 200.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/07/china.usa", "publicationDate": "2008-10-07T16:12:15Z", "tags": ["US news", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China cancelled a visit to Washington by a senior general, slapped an indefinite ban on port calls by US naval vessels, and cancelled low-level diplomatic exchanges with the US today, in angry retaliation to a US plan to sell $6.5bn in advanced weaponry to Taiwan.", "China regards Taiwan, which has enjoyed de facto independence since 1949, as a renegade province.", "But its aim to unify the island with the mainland is opposed by a majority of Taiwanese.", "Under a 1979 law, the US in effect pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any attempt by China to forcibly acquire the territory.", "The arms sale was first proposed by the US in 2001 but ran into opposition in Taiwan&apos;s parliament, the Legislative Yuan, as well as in Beijing.", "It includes 330 Patriot ground-to-air missiles, 30 Apache helicopters, 182 Javelin anti-tank missiles and spare parts for Taiwan&apos;s existing fleet of F16 fighters.", "China has rapidly expanded its overall military spending in recent years and has deployed an estimated 1,000 missiles across the strategic Taiwan Strait, facing Taiwan.", "Prickly US relations with Taiwan have eased since the election as president last March of the nationalist Kuomintang party (KMT) leader and former Taipei mayor, Ma Ying-jeou.", "Ma has taken a series of steps to improve cross-straits relations since taking office, including direct charter flights for businesspeople and tourists, a lifting of caps on Taiwanese investment in China, and the opening of permanent representative offices in both countries.Taiwan also provided assistance to China during last May&apos;s Sichuan earthquake disaster.", "As a result of the thaw, Chen Yun-lin, the top official in charge of China&apos;s Taiwan policy, is expected to visit the island soon.", "Embroiled in major conflicts in the Middle East, Washington has been keen to defuse cross-straits tensions and persuade the Taiwanese to take more responsibility for their own defence.", "According to the CRS report, a closer relationship between China and Taiwan &quot;may complicate US regional interests&quot;."], "title": "Simon Tisdall: US-Taiwan arms plan highlights tensions with China", "article": "China cancelled a visit to Washington by a senior general, slapped an indefinite ban on port calls by US naval vessels, and cancelled low-level diplomatic exchanges with the US today, in angry retaliation to a US plan to sell $6.5bn in advanced weaponry to Taiwan.  A spokesman for China&apos;s foreign ministry in Beijing, Qin Gang, said the US move broke international law and would cast a shadow over bilateral relations. The proposed sale &quot;has contaminated the sound atmosphere for our military relations and gravely jeopardised China&apos;s national security&quot;, Qin said. China regards Taiwan, which has enjoyed de facto independence since 1949, as a renegade province. But its aim to unify the island with the mainland is opposed by a majority of Taiwanese. Under a 1979 law, the US in effect pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any attempt by China to forcibly acquire the territory. A Pentagon spokesman described China&apos;s reaction to the sale as &quot;unfortunate&quot; and said it would lead to missed opportunities. But both sides appeared to be anxious to limit the fallout from the row. US-China cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues in Iran and North Korea was not expected to be affected. The arms sale was first proposed by the US in 2001 but ran into opposition in Taiwan&apos;s parliament, the Legislative Yuan, as well as in Beijing. It was initially valued at $12bn and potentially included Aegis-class frigates, submarines and advanced F16 fighter jets. The current package is much less ambitious, consisting of defensive weapons systems. It includes 330 Patriot ground-to-air missiles, 30 Apache helicopters, 182 Javelin anti-tank missiles and spare parts for Taiwan&apos;s existing fleet of F16 fighters. The Pentagon also announced a sale of Harpoon missiles last month. China has rapidly expanded its overall military spending in recent years and has deployed an estimated 1,000 missiles across the strategic Taiwan Strait, facing Taiwan. Prickly US relations with Taiwan have eased since the election as president last March of the nationalist Kuomintang party (KMT) leader and former Taipei mayor, Ma Ying-jeou. Ma&apos;s predecessor as president, the Democratic Progressive party&apos;s (DPP) Chen Shui-bian, angered Washington and Beijing by pushing what both saw as a destabilising pro-independence agenda. That may have led to an undeclared freeze on new arms sales. Ma has taken a series of steps to improve cross-straits relations since taking office, including direct charter flights for businesspeople and tourists, a lifting of caps on Taiwanese investment in China, and the opening of permanent representative offices in both countries.Taiwan also provided assistance to China during last May&apos;s Sichuan earthquake disaster. As a result of the thaw, Chen Yun-lin, the top official in charge of China&apos;s Taiwan policy, is expected to visit the island soon. If it takes place, it will be the highest-level contact since 1949. All the same, Ma&apos;s popularity has been falling amid DPP criticism that he was kow-towing to China and failing to obtain reciprocal concessions. His decision to risk China&apos;s displeasure and go ahead with the arms purchase may help him counter perceptions of undue servility towards the mainland. &quot;We think this announcement from the US government is a sign that the past eight years of discord are over,&quot; Ma said in a statement. According to a report last month by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), a US decision on the sale had been expected before the Bush administration leaves office in January. Defence analysts suggested the White House wanted to push the deal through now rather than leave the decision to the incoming, possibly Democratic administration. Embroiled in major conflicts in the Middle East, Washington has been keen to defuse cross-straits tensions and persuade the Taiwanese to take more responsibility for their own defence. Yet now this appears to be happening, there are signs of second thoughts.

So HBOS lost 41.5% of its value, down 66.8p to 94p. With nearly 500m shares traded, Royal Bank of Scotland slumped 39% to 90p, a 15 year low. Barclays dropped 29p to 285p and HBOS&apos;s putative new owner, Lloyds TSB, lost 33.5p to 225.5p.

Wall Street too was seeking direction, with a proposed $10bn fundraising by Bank of America proving a negative factor, balanced by news that the US Federal Reserve had begun a programme to buy commercial paper in an attempt to unblock the credit markets. There was, again, talk of emergency interest rate cuts, with some economists hoping for a UK reduction of 100 basis points ahead of the expected announcement on Thursday, possibly as part of concerted central bank action. Mark McCutcheon, head of broking at IAF Securities, said: &quot;I&apos;ve never seen anything like this - the amount of volatility in the market and all the issues with the banks. No one has.

Its shares rose 19p to 901p on the basis its financing looked more sound than many.

Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey, which last week announced a delay in completing a relaxation of its banking covenants, closed down 2.25p at 25.5p, while Barratt Developments dropped 9p to 93p. Directories group Yell, however, announced it had successfully renegotiated its covenant terms, and its shares added 5.5p to 99.25p. Despite this, analysts at Charles Stanley repeated their sell recommendation, saying: &quot;The shares do not look particularly cheap. No dividend is expected to be paid until March 2011 at the earliest. The business is likely to be run primarily in the interests of debt holders and the shares are likely to remain highly volatile.&quot; Infrastructure services group Mouchel rose 41p to 330p after unveiling a 16.5% rise in annual profits, while retailer Mothercare climbed 11.25p to 328p after a positive update from analysts at Kaupthing. They said: &quot;Site visits with management underpin our optimistic view about medium term profitability, including in the UK. The investment case for Mothercare is underpinned by a significant self-help programme in the UK and rapid international development. Even aside from these there is a need to recognise the defensiveness of Mothercare&apos;s core product categories and a rising UK birth rate. Management has established a strong track record and current plans are being executed effectively and in a risk-averse manner which ought to instil greater confidence than currently appears to be the case.&quot; Elsewhere, British Airways fell 16.8p to 128.2p, unnerved by another rise in the crude oil price and also by suggestions that its growing pension deficit could mean Spanish airline Iberia seeking a larger slice of the group to be formed by their proposed merger. Broadcaster ITV closed down 4p at 35p after a downgrade from UBS, while technology companies were hit by yesterday&apos;s profit warning from German software group SAP. Sage lost 5.5p to 182.5p, Autonomy was 11p lower at 822p, Aveva fell 134.5p to 943.5p and Micro Focus dropped 34p to 251p. Psion dropped 5.75p to 62p after one of its Japanese trading partners started a court action claiming \u00a38.6m as part of a wider dispute. Psion is also due \u00a39m from some of its trading partners but may need to start legal action itself to recover the money.

China&apos;s foreign ministry in Beijing said the move broke international law and would cast a shadow over bilateral relations. The proposed sale &quot;has contaminated the sound atmosphere for our military relations and gravely jeopardised China&apos;s national security&quot;, a spokesman, Qin Gang, said. China regards Taiwan, which has had de facto independence since 1949, as a renegade province. But its aim to unify the island with the mainland is opposed by a majority of Taiwanese. Under a 1979 law the US in effect pledged to help Taiwan defend itself against any attempt by China to forcibly acquire the territory. The Pentagon described China&apos;s reaction as &quot;unfortunate&quot; and said it would lead to missed opportunities. But both sides appeared anxious to limit the fallout from the row. US-China cooperation on nuclear proliferation issues in Iran and North Korea was not expected to be affected. The arms sale was first proposed by the US in 2001 but ran into opposition in Taiwan&apos;s parliament as well as in Beijing. It was initially valued at $12bn and potentially included Aegis-class frigates, submarines and advanced F16 fighter jets. The current package is less ambitious, consisting of defensive weapons systems. It includes 330 Patriot ground-to-air missiles, 30 Apache helicopters, 182 Javelin anti-tank missiles and spare parts for Taiwan&apos;s existing fleet of F16 fighters.  China has expanded its military spending in recent years and has deployed an estimated 1,000 missiles across the Taiwan Strait, facing Taiwan.

Many believe that the government&apos;s attempt to impose rules on internet users will fail. What it is seeking to do is bring websites in line with traditional media: to make them accountable, subject to laws of libel and so forth. This is a risky strategy for Seoul: if it fails, the government will face the kind of online rebellion that nearly ended the ruling government&apos;s tenure only a few months ago. South Korea is possibly the most wired nation on Earth: 97% of South Korean households have high-speed broadband access. In the UK, by comparison, 35% of homes have no access to the web at all.  Bad manners Some observers say this growth in internet access has brought out the worst in South Koreans. &quot;Internet behaviour in South Korea is somewhat of a low culture. I&apos;m often disgusted or even offended by the manners on the net,&quot; says Dr Youngmi Kim, a professor of sociology and politics at the University of Edinburgh whose research is focusing on issues of governability in Korea, Taiwan and Japan. She is against any outright censorship, but would like to see some sort of campaign encouraging better web manners. The South Korean government is ahead of her. Along with laws controlling internet postings, which are due to be passed in November, Seoul also plans to introduce internet etiquette and ethics lessons in schools this year for children aged seven and older. The question is, can you police the internet? British MPs seem to think so. Members of the Commons select committee for culture, media and sport, which has made the case for centralising controls, say they want &quot;a tighter form of self-regulation, under which the industry would speedily establish a self-regulatory body&quot;. South Korea is going much further. Not only will all sites that publish news be liable to the same restrictions as newspapers, TV and radio, they will be answerable to a government regulatory body - the Korean Communications Standards Commission. The rules extend beyond websites to individuals. All forum and chatroom users will be required to make verifiable real-name registrations, while internet companies will have to make their search algorithms public to improve &quot;transparency&quot;. Most controversial of all, the commission will be given powers to suspend the publication of articles accused of being fraudulent or slanderous, for a minimum of 30 days. During this period the commission will then decide if an article that has been been temporarily deleted or flagged should be removed permanently. However, Seoul&apos;s previous experience with such censorship suggest that unless the government hires thousands more people to staff the commission, which is already behind in processing some 2,000 internet-related objections, just addressing the initial complaints will be unworkable, untenable and unenforceable. Professor Jonathan Zittrain, co-founder of Harvard&apos;s Berkman Centre for Internet &amp; Society, says other aspects of the new laws are unworkable. &quot;There are genuine worries about misinformation that can be spread online, but a regime of requiring real-name registrations for all message boards and chatooms would represent a sweeping law-enforcement effort - and one that could not be readily accomplished without filtering out overseas sites that decline to implement the requirement.&quot; Jean K Min of OhmyNews International, South Korea&apos;s leading citizen-journalist-based portal, says that the new controls smack of Big Brother. &quot;The approval rating of president Lee fell below 20% after the fiasco of US beef imports and poor handling of other sensitive diplomatic issues. Many here suspect the ruling party lawmakers and government officials are actually trying to save the deeply unpopular government by intimidating netizens from posting free online opinions with a variety of new legislation and legal threats.&quot; &apos;Excessive emotional behaviour&apos; Myung-bak Lee, South Korea&apos;s president, defends the proposed measures as checks against &quot;a society rampant with excessive emotional behaviour, disorderliness and rudeness&quot;. In a recent speech, he said: &quot;We have to guard against &apos;infodemics,&apos; a phenomenon in which inaccurate, false information is disseminated; prompting social unrest that spreads like an epidemic.&quot; That speech followed internet-orchestrated protests in August that spilled over into candlelit rallies and vigils in protest at Seoul&apos;s decision to restart beef imports from the US. Composed mostly of the young, the protests emptied schools and colleges and brought cities to a standstill; many ended in violence. The Seoul government blamed the disruption on rumours and lies spread by internet users. It went on to accuse internet service providers of failing to police the content they host and of providing a platform for hate, libellous claims and cyber-bullying. Providers have heeded the warnings. Korea&apos;s biggest portal, Naver, says it will drop all its news output while its rival, Daum, has offered an olive branch to old media. Daum says it will share revenue from its banner advertisements on news stories with newspapers, TV and other media outlets providing the articles. There is an irony in the fact that South Korea, with its focus on giving its citizens access to the high-speed internet, is now seeking to curb how its people use the internet.

I asked him what proportion of Eee PC netbook sales were Windows XP rather than Linux. Surprisingly, he told me. But he didn&apos;t tell me quite enough. Shen -- who is keen on Linux -- said Asus had hoped sales of Eee PCs would be 50:50 between XP and Linux, but actually they were 60:40 in XP&apos;s favour. (I assume that&apos;s for this calendar year.) So far, around 4m have been sold, and the target is 5m for this year.Linux got about 6 months start over XP, including four months this calendar year, so the market has swung XP&apos;s way. However, it&apos;s impossible to say where it will end up. I asked several Asus staff about figures for returns, but none thought that more Linux machines were being returned to stores. This is not the case at MSI, where Andy Tung, the Director of US Sales, told Laptop magazine: &quot;The return rate is at least four times higher for Linux netbooks than Windows XP netbooks.&quot; He said:  People would love to pay $299 or $399 but they don&apos;t know what they get until they open the box. They start playing around with Linux and start realizing that it&apos;s not what they are used to. They don&apos;t want to spend time to learn it so they bring it back to the store.   After trash-talking Microsoft and launching with a Linux netbook, Acer is also shipping XP, and that became its best seller at Amazon.com. (See Are netbooks a threat to Macs?) Shen said Asus would ship 700,000 Eee PCs this month, of which 50,000 will be S101s.  Asus expects to sell around 6m notebooks this year, and 5m netbooks, for a grand total of about 11m units. This should put it in the year&apos;s Top 5 portable computer suppliers, along with HP, Acer, Dell, Toshiba and Lenovo. China&apos;s Lenovo, which sells ThinkPads, could be the one to drop out. Asus&apos;s notebooks and netbooks are created by different divisions with different managers. The netbooks go up to models with 10 inch screens, which is where the notebooks start.

The news comes after Britain announced a \u00a3500bn bank rescue package, including \u00a350bn to buy stakes in its major banks.  At a news conference in Washington, Paulson said that the federal government would use &quot;all resources at its disposal to make our financial system stronger&quot;.  &quot;We will use all of the tools we&apos;ve been given to maximum effectiveness, including strengthening the capitalisation of financial institutions of every size.&quot; Striking a cautious tone that sent shares sliding on Wall Street, Paulson cautioned the US rescue plan will not save all firms. &quot;One thing we must recognize - even with the new treasury authorities, some financial institutions will fail,&quot; he said, adding that regulators will take measures to limit the systemic risk from any single bank failure.

Markets in Germany and France were also up, after Wall Street closed down 2% yesterday in another jittery session. UK banking shares led the risers in London, with HBOS up 27%, Royal Bank of Scotland gaining 20% and Lloyds TSB 10% higher. South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan all cut their domestic interest rates by a quarter point overnight. This followed yesterday&apos;s half-point cuts by the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, with the UK base rate being lowered to 4.5% from 5% at midday yesterday. The financial crisis continued to ripple across Europe this morning. Iceland, which has been hit hard by the financial crisis, this morning took control of the country&apos;s biggest bank Kaupthing. Iceland has now brought most of its banking sector under state control. Kaupthing&apos;s board resigned. The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, said his government was prepared to buy stakes in failing banks while waiving voting rights. Italy has been largely shielded from the global financial turmoil because its banking sector is mostly retail, relying on savers&apos; deposits rather than money markets.  Germany may have to consider nationalising its banks if the crisis continues to worsen, finance minister Peer Steinbrueck told a newspaper.  And in Asia, stockmarkets were mixed after quarter-point rate cuts in Seoul, Hong Kong and Taipei. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was up 2.1% at 15762 and shares in Seoul edged up 0.6%, while Taiwan&apos;s index dropped 1.45% to 5130. &quot;Just lowering interest rates would be far from sufficient in the current situation,&quot; said Amar Gill at CLSA in Singapore. &quot;The main problem now is that banks are not lending to weaker banks, and the overall banking system is not lending to corporates.&quot;  The Bank of Japan did not take part in the coordinated rate move, as its interest rates are already near zero, but the country&apos;s finance minister, Shoichi Nakagawa, welcomed the move.

I imagine that a collective sigh of relief was audible in the Sun&apos;s newsroom when this &quot;massacre of the moggies&quot; news item was unearthed from the bowels of Google. The minutiae of the economic calamity we&apos;re all facing is both terrifying and tedious in equal measure and, frankly, I think we&apos;ve all had it just about up to here. So it must have been bliss to stumble across a story that brilliantly combines two staples of tabloid journalism: pictures of baby animals being cute and tales of foreigners doing the funniest things. The Sun used a photograph of two adorable fluffy kittens to illustrate a story about the Festival Gastronomico del Gato, which takes place every September in the town of La Quebrada, Peru, to celebrate the day of Santa Efigenio. The festival involves the eating of cats \u2013 which is why animal rights activist group, Peta, is in a fury. Here we go again. Another shock horror story about people from other cultures who just don&apos;t understand the difference between animals you cuddle and animals you cover in sauce. Cats are pets, cows are dinner \u2013 we know the rules, so why doesn&apos;t everyone else? The inevitable outcry over consumption of the wrong sort of animal is just as inevitably followed by accusations of western cultural imperialism and hypocrisy from people who take themselves terribly seriously. The rights, wrongs and cultural relativism of cat and dog meat have been regularly rehashed during events such as the 1988 Olympics and 2002 World Cup, which both took place in dog-eating South Korea and the recent Olympics in China \u2013 a culture where very little seems to be off the menu. In Britain, we have an unusually proscriptive view of acceptable sources of meat \u2013 obviously cats and dogs and, in more recent times, rabbits and horses, are too friendly to be food. But it&apos;s not just cute, cuddly animals we avoid: few British people would want to tuck into snake, insects or rodents \u2013 all of which are eaten with great relish in other parts of the world. But this doesn&apos;t necessarily mean we&apos;re hopelessly hypocritical or irrationally sentimental. Much of the outrage about dog and cat meat in parts of Asia arises because of the shockingly brutal way many of these animals are kept and killed. It&apos;s not hypocritical to eat pigs that have been slaughtered to British animal welfare standards at the same time as being appalled by the fact that some cats and dogs are beaten to death or boiled alive before being served at the table in countries with no animal welfare legislation at all. There are, of course, some people who will wield a pen in one hand to write an outraged letter to the Peruvian government about cat slaughter, while the other hand is holding a sandwich filled with a battery-farmed chicken carcass. But most of those who responded to the Sun&apos;s article online suggest a more astute understanding of our complex relationship with edible and inedible animals: &quot;just think of them as very small cows. Job done.&quot; Reads one comment. Another asks why animal rights groups aren&apos;t up in arms about the turkey eating festival held annually in the UK. To be fair to Peta, this isn&apos;t at all fair: they are, in fact, up in arms about the consumption of meat, milk, fur and any other animal derived substance wherever it occurs: Peta has; &quot;toured slaughterhouses for dogs in Taiwan, horses in Texas, and chickens and cows in Europe,&quot; and they weren&apos;t happy with any of it. You might not like them, but you can&apos;t accuse them of inconsistency. Perhaps the most unaskable question is whether cats are worth eating. I haven&apos;t eaten the meat of any animal for more than 20 years, but if I was to fall off the wagon, I don&apos;t think it would be leg of cat that I&apos;d have a hankering for. Cats have, of course, been eaten in this country, but only in instances of extreme poverty or culinary fraud \u2013 cats are easy to come by and, in a pie, who&apos;d notice?

Beijing gets very upset if Taiwan drops its claim to represent all of China and instead opts to go its own way officially, the way it has done in practice for 50 years. The Taiwan Relations Act mandates the White House to ensure that the island has the means of self-defence. In fact, it says that &quot;the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People&apos;s Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means,&quot; which one could consider somewhat negated by all those threats and missiles in the mainland. The Bush administration has refused to sell the F16s that it had earlier promised to Taiwan but never delivered in order to punish Chen Shui Bian, the former president, and his party for wanting to declare independence from China. The majority of Taiwanese no more want to come under Beijing than the Kosovars want to go under Belgrade, but the Bush arms freeze had left Beijing to assume, and no one from the administration has contradicted it, that the US agreed with the PRC&apos;s own rigid definition of the One China Policy. Indeed, Admiral Timothy Keating, the commander of the US Pacific Command, admitted this summer that they had consulted with Beijing about arms for Taiwan, and the state department recently sent out a kow-towing memo to its embassies abroad on how to avoid upsetting the Chinese this Friday by keeping a very low profile at the ROC national day receptions around the world. No wonder the commissars for the Middle Kingdom had become used to accepting obeisance and tribute from the foreign ghosts. However, now, to reward Taiwan&apos;s new president, Ma Ying-jeou, who has been trying to kiss and make up with Beijing, Bush has agreed to deliver half of what the Taiwanese wanted, included the much touted but seriously wonky Patriot missile system, but not the submarines and F16s that the Taiwanese had ordered. The gesture was a little like being half-pregnant as far as the Chinese were concerned. They summoned the American charg\u00e9 d&apos;affaires to tell him they regarded it as a broken promise and were cutting off military and diplomatic cooperation. Ma is from the KMT, the old Chinese nationalist party, whose diehards agree with Beijing on one-China, but disagree with the communists about who represents it, and this national day will be more Republic of China, and less Taiwan. Ma has managed some serious political acrobatics. Without disavowing the old nationalists in his party, he had to persuade the electorate that he would stroke the mainland by eschewing showy gestures, while still maintaining effective independence. The KMT would like the ROC to join the UN as well, without declaring independence, but Beijing&apos;s gratitude only goes so far. It slapped down the new government&apos;s conciliatory attempt to shelve the UN question by going for representation at the World Health Organisation instead. And since it really does not get this democracy and self-determination thing, Beijing has not foresworn the use of force or moved the batteries of hundreds of missiles pointed threateningly at the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese, who have no ambition whatsoever to invade the mainland.  Of course, with all this electoral rhetoric about supporting democracy, one wonders about the degree of American cooperation with one of the least democratic regimes outside Riyadh, not least when contrasted with the lack of support for a democratically elected government in Taiwan. We did see democracy at work in Washington, where John McCain supported the full arms package going to Taiwan, but one has to wonder how principled a stand it was when his neocon adviser Randy Scheunemann had had in his lobbyist&apos;s portfolio not only Georgia, but also Taiwan and Lockheed Martin, purveyors of the Patriot missiles and F16s. Will the policy change if Beijing makes an offer? In fact, the Taiwan government has not been pushing as hard as it could on arms sales, not least because they consciously strove to limit the arms budget in order to spend more on things like education and health, which is a good lesson for both presidential candidates in the US. Taiwan really should cancel on those dud Patriots. A stronger, saner US might be able to parlay possible arms supplies to Taiwan against a Chinese pledge not to use military force to settle the dispute, and to remove all those missiles. But an administration dependent on the Peoples Bank of China to pay for the Wall Street bail-out and lobbyists for framing policy is neither strong nor sane. And neither McCain nor Barack Obama has suggested cutting the defence budget in favour of healthcare and education, which would really be the sanity clause for Marxists and normal humans."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/armstrade-unitednations", "publicationDate": "2008-10-09T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Arms trade", "United Nations", "World news"], "sentences": ["This week marks the start of crucial discussions at the UN on whether or not to start work on a treaty that would stop weapons ending up in the hands of abusers, and that would tighten controls on the huge number of weapons flooding our planet (China warns US over plan for $6.5bn arms sale to Taiwan, October 8)."], "title": "Letter: Time for action on the arms trade", "article": "This week marks the start of crucial discussions at the UN on whether or not to start work on a treaty that would stop weapons ending up in the hands of abusers, and that would tighten controls on the huge number of weapons flooding our planet (China warns US over plan for $6.5bn arms sale to Taiwan, October 8).

The FTSE 100, which had gained ground strongly earlier in the day in a bounce after Wednesday&apos;s big sell-off, dropped in line with Wall Street to end down 1.2%, or 52.9 points, at 4,318, its lowest close in four years. The FTSE 100 has so far fallen by 700 points this week.  Banks such as HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland closed 31% and 6% higher in the wake of the government&apos;s rescue package, but Barclays was London&apos;s worst-performing blue chip stock, down 13% on speculation that it may look to its shareholders for a capital injection rather than draw on the government&apos;s initial \u00a325bn of funds. The wider market was hit by a weak opening in New York, where the Dow Jones industrial average shed 115 points, or 1.25%, to around 9,195. Iceland&apos;s deepening banking crisis - which has left many British councils facing potentially hundreds of million of pounds of losses - also weighed on markets and pushed down other major exchanges in Europe. One professional investment manager who manages a portfolio worth billions of pounds said there were fears that share prices were now being pushed down by &quot;forced solvency sellers&quot; - who have to liquidate holdings to meet demands for cash or regulations that require that shareholdings are sold below certain levels. &quot;It is unclear who is still selling at these levels,&quot; he said. &quot;Short selling is severely restricted and there cannot be any pension fund managers selling at these levels. They would be sitting tight.&quot; There are certainly signs that some individual investors are forced-sellers. The financier Robert Tchenguiz has lost up to \u00a31bn on the forced sale of big stakes in the pubs group Mitchells &amp; Butlers and the supermarket group J Sainsbury after his financial backer, the collapsed Icelandic bank Kaupthing, called in loans and tried to raise cash. There are also concerns that hedge funds are dumping holdings to repay investors. The end of September was a quarterly redemption day for hedge funds, when investors can ask to pull out their holdings. There has been a rush to redeem, especially among pension funds. On Wall Street, reports that the US treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, was considering following the UK&apos;s lead and taking part ownership in a number of US banks helped to restore a relative calm. However, initial gains were wiped out when the ailing US car maker General Motors said its profits would be badly hit by the economic downturn. Its shares have fallen to their lowest level since 1950. President George Bush attempted to bolster the markets with plans to meet finance officials from the Group of Seven countries at the White House tomorrow. Paulson said the treasury was moving quickly to implement the $700bn rescue effort and hinted that he might expand the rescue to include ways to bolster the capital of banks. On Wednesday, the Dow was down 35% from its high of 14,164.53 reached one year ago. Cuts in interest rates in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan yesterday also helped Asian markets after a brutal round of selling on Wednesday. There were signs money markets welcomed the \u00a3500bn of funds and guarantees announced by the British government on Wednesday. &quot;Libor&quot; rates - the interest at which banks lend to each other in wholesale markets - fell for overnight funding in most major currencies, although were higher for longer-term dollar funds; analysts say it may take time to get money markets working properly again.

ZimbabweWhile much of the rest of the world is anxious about plunging stock markets, bank collapses and a looming recession, Zimbabweans would settle for any of that just to be able to find cash and to have it worth something in the face of an official inflation rate of 231 million percent.  Independent economists say the real inflation rate is in the trillions, but such numbers have ceased to mean anything to most Zimbabweans, who are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of a few pence a day from their bank accounts because of a drastic shortage of cash notes, with the Zimbabwe dollar in freefall. This week the government legalised the use of US dollars and rand in shops, formalising a part of the extensive foreign currency black market driven by the 3 million Zimbabweans who have left the country in search of work, mostly in South Africa. Everyone else is reduced to scraping by on near worthless salaries, bartering their furniture for food or growing their own to survive.  Europe Central EuropeRussia, Romania and Ukraine suspended their stockmarkets today. The cost of insuring the sovereign debt of Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other eastern European countries soared, pricing in a mounting risk of default. Emerging sovereign debt spreads widened over US treasuries to their widest levels since mid-2004. RussiaThe Kremlin admitted it was considering a Brown-style plan to ease Russia&apos;s dire banking problems. The Russian government will set up a special fund to buy &quot;quality&quot; assets from banks struggling with liquidity. Initially, Russia&apos;s central bank would pump in $15bn. Russia&apos;s twin leaders, meanwhile, have wasted little time in blaming the US. President Dmitry Medvedev this week memorably accused the US administration of &quot;economic egoism&quot;. Vladimir Putin, Russia&apos;s prime minister, went further. During a meeting with Russian communists, he said the US&apos;s dominant role in economic matters was over. &quot;Confidence in the United States as the leader of the free world and the free market... has been undermined \u2013 for good \u2013 I think,&quot; Putin gleefully observed. At the same time, Russia has been keen to understate its own economic difficulties. Although regulators suspended trading again today on Russia&apos;s two main stockmarkets, TV news channels have been told not to use the words &quot;collapse&quot; or &quot;crisis&quot;. Apparently there isn&apos;t one. There has been little mention on TV of the flight of foreign investors from Russia, or the fact that many Russian oligarchs are struggling to pay their dry cleaning bills. Czech RepublicStocks in Prague fell more than 13%. HungaryShares in Budapest lost more than 12% and the Hungarian forint hit a two-year low. PolandThe Polish deputy finance minister, Katarzyna Zajdel-Kurowska, said the fundamentals of Poland&apos;s economy were strong, and blamed the overnight decline of the Polish zloty on the slump in Hungary. The zloty hit an eight-month low. IcelandThere was no international trade of the Icelandic crown today after its banking sector, currency and economy crashed. Iceland says it has approached Russia for a loan to cover its banking liabilities, with analysts also speculating over a possible bail-out from the International Monetary Fund. AustriaShare trading was briefly halted in Vienna this morning. FranceThe CAC-40 index in Paris dropped 7.7% to 3176.  GermanyThe Dax closed 7.1% down at 4541 points. SwedenSweden&apos;s stock exchange declared a &quot;fast market&quot; until further notice for cash trading and for the Nordic derivatives market. The bourse said a fast market is declared when a financial market is experiencing high volume and increased volatility. The move allows greater flexibility in some trading rules. Shares in Stockholm fell nearly 6% to 196 points this morning. ItalyNearly half of Milan stocks were suspended after excessive losses. Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said the stockmarkets were in a grip of panic and fear, and expected consumption to fall due to fear. He said the government and the Bank of Italy had asked banks not to call in loans and to keep supporting industry. He also said European Union leaders may discuss the &quot;hypothesis&quot; of suspending markets temporarily while trying to resolve the global financial crisis. SpainThe Madrid stock exchange lost 8.7% to 973 points at the close. Spanish prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero is pushing for an urgent meeting of the 15 eurozone leaders. He asked French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who currently holds the rotating EU presidency, to call the meeting &quot;to define a strong, coordinated action among all the countries in the eurozone.&quot; SwitzerlandThe Swiss market dropped 4.75% to 5523 points. UKA wave of panic selling wiped more than \u00a3100bn off the value of Britain&apos;s biggest companies.  Dealers in the City dumped shares when trading began, sending the FTSE 100 plummeting by more than 10% in early trading. It closed 8.85% lower at 3932.1 \u2013 a 381.7 point fall, wiping about \u00a389.5bn off the value of Britain&apos;s biggest companies. This is the worst daily fall since the crash of 1987, beating Monday&apos;s 7.85% decline. Banks and miners led the fallers, along with blue chip firms such as British Airways and BT, as the wider economy was pulled into the deepening financial crisis. America/South America United StatesOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones plummeted nearly 700 points in the first ten minutes of trading to 7882, a fall of 8%. BrazilBrazil&apos;s main stock index plummeted more than 10% in early trading. The Ibovespa index fell 10.2% to 33,303 in just the first half-hour after markets opened. Trading was then halted for 30 minutes because of a &quot;circuit breaker&quot; rule that kicks in when the Ibovespa loses 10%. Global financial turmoil has wiped out two years of stock market gains in Latin America&apos;s biggest economy. Brazil&apos;s currency, the real, weakened to 2.3 against the US dollar. VenezuelaPresident Hugo Chavez said his socialist revolution was not immune from the global financial crisis. State bonds on international markets have dropped to their lowest levels in five years and plunging oil prices are expected to squeeze next year&apos;s budget. Consumer spending on cars and other big items has already started to shrivel.  The finance minister, Ali Rodriguez, made an unfamiliar call for austerity in government departments. &quot;Spending on certain types of vehicles, mobile phones and parties will be eliminated,&quot; he said.  Chavez said Venezuela&apos;s state-heavy economy was better positioned to weather the financial storm, a &quot;sinking of neoliberalism&quot; which he blamed on the International Monetary Fund. He hoped the crisis would prompt other Latin American leaders to forge ahead with his cherished plan to create a &quot;Bank of the South&quot; to counter the Washington-dominated World Bank. CubaCuba&apos;s isolation from global financial markets has largely protected it from capitalist contagion, allowing it to watch the turmoil with relative equanimity. &quot;It was expected,&quot; the former president, Fidel Castro, noted in his regular column in the communist party newspaper, Granma.  Other pro-government commentators blamed the crisis on the US and said &quot;associates or tributaries of that empire&quot; were now suffering the consequences. They said the time had come for Latin America to form the pan-regional leftist front which Cuba and Venezuela have espoused. Cuba is facing its own crisis after a series of recent hurricanes devastated agriculture and infrastructure. President Raul Castro has warned of food shortages and months, if not years, of painful rebuilding. This week, the government started to lease land to private farmers, a cautious but potentially important initiative to loosen communist control and reform the island&apos;s moribund agriculture."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/11/piano.hiromi", "publicationDate": "2008-10-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Life and style", "Music", "Culture"], "sentences": ["I played a concert in Taiwan when I was 12."], "title": "Piano and keyboard guide part 1: Virtuoso pianist Hiromi describes her tumultuous love affair with the instrument", "article": "Who inspired you to start playing the piano?  My mum took me to my first piano lesson and I instantly fell in love with it. When did you realise this was something you wanted to do professionally? I played a concert in Taiwan when I was 12. I didn&apos;t speak a word of Chinese, I couldn&apos;t understand the MC or what was written on the programme. I stepped out on to the stage, played a song, and I felt everyone in the concert hall smiling. I thought, if I can keep making people happy with my music, that will be more than amazing. Do you have any tips for beginners? Surround yourself with good music and good players. Learning music is just like learning a new language: if you surround yourself with native-speakers, you&apos;ll improve rapidly. What or who are your greatest influences?  There are so many. The first two piano players I listened to were Erroll Garner and Oscar Peterson. They got me interested in improvisation. What encouragement would you give to someone on the verge of giving up?  I don&apos;t think I can. Only people who cannot cut their relationship with music keep going, because it is something too connected to yourself. Can you recall your most memorable on-stage moment?  I recently played a tribute to Oscar Peterson at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland. Oscar&apos;s wife and daughter were in the audience and after the performance, they told me that Oscar would have been very happy. I couldn&apos;t ask for more than that. Your performances often combine the keyboard and piano. Which do you prefer? Piano is always my principal instrument; keyboard is something additional that makes my music more colorful. Do you use the same piano for every performance?  I don&apos;t take my own piano to every show. I do have a specific make I prefer, but sometimes it doesn&apos;t fit the stage or isn&apos;t available. Almost every day I have to get to know a new piano. It is like a blind date. Sometimes I get a piano I instantly fall in love with, sometimes I get one that is hard to befriend. It&apos;s all part of the challenge and fun of piano playing. I want to make the piano happy and I want it to remember me. I want to give it a good time! \u00b7 Hiromi&apos;s latest album, Beyond Standard, is out now"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/11/china-globaleconomy", "publicationDate": "2008-10-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Global economy", "Market turmoil", "World news", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The nationalist Global Times suggested Beijing should start short-selling its huge holdings of US treasury bonds to punish Washington for selling arms to Taiwan."], "title": "China hopes to stand firm in storm", "article": "China looks likely to emerge stronger in the weakened financial system after weathering its own crises of unrest in Tibet and the Sichuan earthquake this year. Most experts there predict that the relative isolation of the country&apos;s financial system, high savings rate and the internal strengths of the fast-growing economy will help keep it secure. But concerns remain about the shrinking of big overseas markets and the likely inflation of commodities. This is likely to hit Guangdong, Zhejiang and other coastal industrial hubs, which rely on exports to provide demand for their factories. Even before the crisis, China&apos;s economic growth is thought to have slowed from the red-hot pace of recent years. This was partly because of government credit-tightening measures to tackle inflation. But growth is still enviably rapid. In a report issued today, the country&apos;s top think tank, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, estimates the economy will grow 10.1% in 2008 and 9.5% in 2009. &quot;The financial crisis and the world economic slowdown will have an impact on us, but they won&apos;t change the fundamentals of the Chinese economy,&quot; Chen Jiagui, vice-head of the academy, said. Compared with last year&apos;s 11.9% growth rate, it is a slowdown. The authorities are trying to further stimulate domestic demand, which is seen as the best way to offset the loss of export business. This week, the People&apos;s Bank of China was quick to follow the coordinated move by six central banks in North America and Europe with a 0.27 percentage point reduction of interest rates. Despite the crunch overseas, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences says retail sales will increase by 19% and exports by 21% this year. Analysts are studying the opportunities for China to buy cheaply into strategically important foreign firms that were previously too expensive or too politically sensitive to consider. China&apos;s acquisition of such stakes has been accelerating in the past three years, according to the Boston Consulting Group, which noted five buyouts by Chinese banks worth more than $1bn since 2005. While the British bail-out has attracted some passing comment, editorials and commentators have looked towards Wall Street, many asking whether the US model of capitalism was finished, and what the implications would be for the rising power of China. The nationalist Global Times suggested Beijing should start short-selling its huge holdings of US treasury bonds to punish Washington for selling arms to Taiwan. While the government has shown no sign of making such a move - which would be tantamount to declaring financial war - the article received considerable support in debating forums. &quot;Financial liberalism has gone wild since the Thatcher cabinet and the Reagan administration set off a wave of &apos;neo-liberalism&apos; in the 1980s,&quot; noted Liu Junhong, a researcher with China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, in a comment piece for the English-language newspaper China Daily."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/11/immigration-people-trafficking", "publicationDate": "2008-10-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "China", "UK news", "World news", "Politics", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Nobody should go.&quot; Fujian province has had a criminal tradition since the 70s, when gangs smuggling luxury goods from Taiwan began transporting people, too."], "title": "People trafficking: 'It is down your street and in your lane'", "article": "It was one of dozens of advertisements in the Chinese Business Gazette, a freesheet circulated in Chinatown in London. A brothel was advertising for staff: &quot;Located in outer London. Catered only for westerners. Busy. Comfort-able living environment. Safety guaranteed. Recruiting Misses. Housekeeper urgently required. Female only.&quot; Hsiao-Hung Pai, a reporter who has carried out undercover investigations for the Guardian in the past, applied for the housekeeper job. Summoned to a neat, featureless block of flats in leafy Bedfordshire, she was hired on the spot by Linda, an illegal immigrant using an assumed English name, who turns an annual profit of \u00a3250,000 running two brothels employing teenage girls trafficked from China. Hsiao-Hung&apos;s duties were to cook, clean and look after the girls. She soon realised the &quot;misses&quot; came and went on a weekly basis, rotated through Chinese-run brothels in a routine intended to keep the customers happy and the authorities guessing. It&apos;s part of a well-established system. Young girls are lured to the UK with the promise of lucrative, respectable careers. Some as young as 11, they arrive without passports or visas, some claiming asylum at British airports, having paid traffickers thousands of pounds for their transit. Once here, they vanish from the hostels or foster care to which they have been assigned by the immigration authorities, often ending up in brothels run from suburban flats and houses. Hsiao-Hung - posing as Xiao Yun, just in from Zhejiang province, in south-eastern China - saw for herself that the misses are never allowed out and have no idea where they are, the time of day or even the month. Few can speak English or know anything about their rights, the UK&apos;s asylum processes or its legal system; they are made to believe they have no alternative but to remain in the brothels until they have earned enough to buy their release, and their only contact with British society is the men with whom they have sex. Madam Linda&apos;s phone rings. &quot;It&apos;s Big Cunt,&quot; she says - she has such a nickname for all her clients. She arrived from Beijing four years back and worked as a prostitute until she&apos;d amassed enough money to climb up the pecking order and become a lao ban niang, a madam. She switches into a sweet English voice: &quot;We&apos;ve got a nice young girl, cup 32, very pretty, lots of demand.&quot; She is talking about Miss Rong, an exhausted-looking Chinese girl dressed in a lacy pink negligee, sitting on the sofa behind her, who was trafficked to Britain 18 months ago and who won&apos;t divulge her age. Trade is brisk today. Yet none of the other residents of Avon Court, a 70s block of flats on Shakespeare Road, Bedford, seems to suspect what&apos;s going on in this two-bedroom, ground-floor flat. Dozens of Chinese girls pass through here, part of a network that has sprawled out across almost every British town and city. It is a criminal enterprise that blurs the boundaries between trafficking and smuggling, ensnaring girls and women who in many cases leave China of their own free will. Often sent with the best wishes of their community, which has clubbed together to pay the exorbitant fees, the victims cannot bear to tell their families what they have been compelled to do on arrival. None would consider turning witness against their controllers: their heads are filled with horror stories of how they will be raped and imprisoned by the British police, and what would happen to those back home. Girls who attempt to run away are often hunted down, abducted from local authority care or hospitals. Frequently, victims emerge only when, injured, sick or pregnant, they have been abandoned on a street corner. It is evident there are incredible profits to be made. Last year, police discovered \u00a393m transferred back to China via one bank account held by a Chinese restaurant in Kent - money suspected to have been earned through trafficking and brothel-keeping. Recently, two specialist national police units have been created to define, penetrate and disrupt the trade. Home Office minister Vernon Coaker, who is leading the government&apos;s new anti-trafficking initiative, told us, &quot;Just five years back I would not have believed this kind of thing could be happening in Britain. But it is down your street, in your lane, run by communities into which we have made few meaningful inroads.&quot; &quot;Hurry up, cow cunt,&quot; Madam Linda shrieks at her new housekeeper. The doorbell rings and an overweight, married white man in his 50s saunters in. Two minutes later, &quot;Little Dick&quot; arrives. Then a third: an Asian mini-cab driver so new he has no pet name. They sit, sullenly, each waiting their turn with Miss Rong. When they have left, and Madam Linda has gone to check on her misses in another rented flat, on Station Road, Miss Rong tells us her story. She was once a waitress in a Chinese town she doesn&apos;t wish to name. She was earning less than \u00a350 a month and living with her parents when local traffickers persuaded her she would make her fortune in London. On her arrival, Miss Rong was taken to a brothel in Ealing where she had sex with seven clients on the first day. &quot;You clench your teeth and endure the pain,&quot; she says. After a few weeks, &quot;Alan&quot;, the brothel&apos;s Hong Kong boss, passed her on to a pimp with an apartment overlooking Baker Street in London, trading as China Red. When Miss Rong was found to have syphilis, she was thrown out. Without papers, she could not go to a GP for medication. There was no going back home until the debt was paid and no words to describe to her conservative parents the reality of life abroad. Sick and penniless, Miss Rong sought out another brothel, this time on a council estate in Seven Sisters, north London, known as the Red Tower. Last summer, she was working in a Birmingham-based business advertising &quot;student-like young girls&quot; and &quot;female servants&quot;. By the time she was taken on by Madam Linda at Avon Court - on duty from 7am to 2am, seven days a week, dosed with antibiotics bought by Madam Linda to counter the syphilis - she estimates she&apos;d had sex with more than 7,000 men. &quot;I must earn as fast as I can,&quot; Miss Rong says, adding that she&apos;s paid \u00a320 for each 20-minute session. &quot;I must get through it all and get back home.&quot; After Hsiao-Hung Pai had been at the brothel for three days, Madam Linda told her to start giving customers massages. Soon after, Hsiao-Hung left. Five foot nothing and wearing a white T-shirt, Lingshan Lin, 15, and her 11-year-old sister Lingran disappeared on September 28 2006 from a social services hostel in Hove, East Sussex, where they were staying pending their asylum hearing. On August 24 2007, Li Juan He, 16, ran away from a hostel in Worthing, West Sussex. Xi Wang, 16, disappeared from the same hostel two months later, on October 7 2007. Jing Jing Lu, 16, vanished from a hostel in Sevenoaks, Kent, on December 15 2007. All had entered the UK just days before their disappearance; the only evidence they had ever been here is the photographs taken of them by police, immigration officials or social services. The authorities fear they may have been dragged into the brothel network which, our findings suggest, has more than 4,000 Chinese teenagers and young adults in its grip. Police and social services know from missing person reports that more than 1,000 have disappeared, almost all of whom have been trafficked through or were born in the Chinese province of Fujian. Which is puzzling, as Fujian is one of the wealthiest provinces in the People&apos;s Republic, highly industrialised and pumping out goods for the west. There are opportunities galore. And when you meet Fujianese people on their home turf, they talk only of success. We are invited to a dinner in an upscale restaurant in Fuzhou, the booming provincial capital, and our fellow guests are brimming with confidence. We ask Ai Hwa Lin - a friend of a friend, who owns two dress shops and a new \u00a3150,000 condominium overlooking the Min river - why people, especially teenagers, risk all to leave here. &quot;No one leaves any more,&quot; she says. &quot;We have everything we need.&quot; But when her husband, Gao Xin, pipes up for the first time, an hour into the banquet, he speaks in English, with a New Jersey drawl: &quot;Welcome to China, where life&apos;s real good.&quot; As Ai Hwa glowers, an indiscreet relative chimes in: &quot;Gao Xin has been away for 17 years.&quot; He was working illegally as a chef in a Fujianese restaurant in New York state and returned three weeks ago - the first time he&apos;d been home. Ai Hwa reluctantly admits that we are last-minute additions to her husband&apos;s homecoming dinner and that he is the source of their wealth. We now notice how wan and fragile he seems, as if he almost worked himself to death. He is a stranger among family and friends. But after many toasts of Sedrin beer, it emerges that everyone around the table has recently paid for someone to travel abroad illegally, raising sums as large as \u00a320,000 for their illicit passage. Expectations are high, but there is no clear idea of what the relatives will do on arrival. Despite the weekly phone calls, the emails and photographs of which everyone here talks, no one really knows what is being endured by their loved ones abroad. A man in a golf shirt ambles over and introduces himself as Officer Zheng Xian, head of the city police&apos;s economic crimes division, whose responsibilities include countering trafficking. He is one of Ai Hwa&apos;s oldest friends and asks if we have heard her sister&apos;s story. He says her parents paid criminals to smuggle her to Britain in 1997; she had an excruciating six-month journey via Russia, the Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Holland, and ended up earning slave wages in British garment and poultry factories. Everyone has been touched by smuggling, but no one has mentioned the missing. We bring out a sheaf of reports from the UK, including ones about Fujianese girls as young as 11 who might have been swallowed up by the sex trade. &quot;They&apos;re just working,&quot; one woman mutters as she rises and leaves.  &quot;You&apos;ll never find their families,&quot; says Xian, pointing out that Fujian has a population of almost 40 million: the names we have are so common, it would be like looking for a Jane Smith in London. In less than five minutes, everyone has gone except Ai Hwa and her ailing husband, who snaps out of his dream world. &quot;&apos;What was it all for?&quot; he asks of no one in particular. &quot;I lost my life. Nobody should go.&quot; Fujian province has had a criminal tradition since the 70s, when gangs smuggling luxury goods from Taiwan began transporting people, too. They first smuggled them to the UK in the 90s, mostly to work in restaurant kitchens for the long-established Hong Kong Chinese community. It was only when 58 Fujianese men and women were found broiled in the back of a lorry transporting tomatoes through Dover in June 2000 that the province became known in Britain as a haven for snakehead gangs who could evade whatever obstacles our immigration services threw up. Four years later, 23 paperless Fujianese workers who earned pennies picking cockles in Morecambe Bay were drowned. And alongside the illegal workers and gangmasters who made the headlines, a hidden parallel trade was emerging - in girls recruited into the nascent Chinese brothel network creeping across the UK. But no one in Fuzhou will talk details: names, methods, routes. Some clearly fear reprisals, while to others it is commercially sensitive information. We drive out to villages from which the missing girls told immigration officials they came. All are dominated by new churches as large as ocean liners. We call in on one, the True Jesus Church, and ask the pastor, Chen Jin Yun, if she will help us find families whose children have gone missing in Britain. She laughs. &quot;Many have got children working in the UK. They love it there, but keeping in contact is always a struggle.&quot; She introduces us to duck farmer Mr Liang. All three of his brothers have gone to the UK, he says. We ask about methods, money, how they&apos;re doing. Liang sidesteps most of the questions: &quot;Oh, one of them is a millionaire. Everyone who goes from here to there, young or old, does very well.&quot; Liang&apos;s neighbours crowd into the room and confirm they all have children in the UK, some as young as 13. We decide against bringing out the reports of the missing. Don&apos;t they discourage their children from going so far away from home now that there are plenty of opportunities in Fujian, we ask, mentioning the hundreds of garment factories lining every highway. Liang jumps in: &quot;Those are menial jobs for outsiders,&quot; he says - Fujianese people have higher expectations than the wages offered by these factories, \u00a325 for an 84-hour week. Heads around him nod. We later check with the factory bosses and they confirm that tens of thousands of their employees are young women from impoverished and predominantly agricultural provinces such as Anhui, Hubei and Henan, 1,000 miles from here, whose residents cannot afford to be so picky. Later, Liang shows us the vast concrete skeleton of a building rising beside his duck pond: &quot;My new home. Paid for by my brothers.&quot; Villages such as Xi Zai in Fujian province have emptied to the UK, leaving behind a dwindling population of the very young and very old. The Chinese government has recently said it will crack down on trafficking, establishing special police units to do so. Liang&apos;s cousin, it turns out, is a detective in the Jinfeng police force. We get out the reports to show her. She doesn&apos;t want to know, though three of her siblings are in the UK. &quot;You should speak to the Chinese embassy in London,&quot; she snaps. We leave, but our Chinese researcher returns a few days later. Liang, the duck farmer, is delighted to see her. He feels more relaxed among Chinese people, he says, asking what she does. &quot;I&apos;m a student, from a poor family,&quot; she says. &quot;Why don&apos;t you marry someone rich?&quot; he suggests. &quot;Or go to London?&quot; He offers to assist: &quot;If your family can raise \u00a315,000, my cousin will get you over.&quot; Our researcher adds a level of difficulty. &quot;I have a young cousin, too, 12, who would like to come along.&quot; Liang shrugs. &quot;Great. Don&apos;t worry. We send plenty of kids. It&apos;s 100% safe.&quot; Eventually, he explains how it works. His cousin is just one of a hundred people offering similar services. All can procure forged passports redesignating the travellers as Japanese or South Korean citizens, nationalities that raise fewer suspicions with immigration officials in Britain. Our researcher would be first flown or driven to Russia, where Chinese people require no visa. Then they might fly on directly to the UK, probably avoiding Heathrow. &quot;Few bother with trucks and boats any more,&quot; Liang says. Another preferred option is flying to a European city, then on to the UK with easyJet, the Madrid-London route being a current favourite. Our researcher will be given a UK sim card to hide in her luggage, and a phone number to write on her bra strap. She is to activate her phone and make the call on landing, and meet a Fujianese contact. &quot;Hang around the airport before going through immigration,&quot; Liang says, &quot;so they have no idea which flight you came in on, otherwise they could send you back. Then go to immigration and say you&apos;re a teenage asylum seeker. They have to let you in, and Britain will allow you to stay until you are 18.&quot; &quot;When can I go?&quot; our researcher asks.  &quot;The next trip will be in November. We need sufficient passengers to make it worth our while. Eight or nine on a flight.&quot; Few of the British authorities tackling trafficking have been given the freedom to travel across China, observing for themselves the suffering and upheaval that result from the human trade. Relationships between British detectives and China&apos;s ministry of public security are in their infancy, with the first conference between Fujianese officials and their opposite numbers in the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) taking place in the UK this autumn. The traffickers have had a 15-year head start - the British authorities having spent nearly that long arguing over data and definitions. The first warning that Chinese children were being abused came in 1995 when dozens began arriving, unaccompanied, at Gatwick airport, claiming asylum, but the signs were ignored by everyone except the social workers called to deal with them. What those sending the children to Britain appeared to have hit upon, as the duck farmer Liang explained, was the specifics of British law, and in particular the breadth of the 1989 Children Act, whereby foreign teenagers travelling alone who claimed asylum had to be allowed into the country and cared for by a local authority as a &quot;child in need&quot; until they were 18. Sussex social workers had so many demands on them, they fought to find funding for a young asylum seekers team. The team&apos;s trafficking caseworker was Lynne Chitty, whose house in Portsmouth is filled with a jumble of files, photographs and incident reports relating to missing Chinese girls. She tells us, &quot;We would get the call, go up to the airport and find these kids in a holding room. They all had little bits of rolled-up paper with UK numbers on them and were desperate to make a call. Within hours of us taking them into care, they had vanished.&quot; From the brief interviews Chitty managed to conduct, she became convinced that all had been trafficked and many were ending up in brothels or worse. &quot;No one wanted to hear or was overly concerned about the kids going missing. The only calls I got were from the Met police in London saying they had fished the body of an Asian child out of the river and asking if it was one of mine. And I had to say: &apos;I have no idea.&apos;&quot;  It did not take long for the traffickers to evolve new methods. Instead of arriving with a telephone number, the children began presenting addresses and names of relatives in the UK, hoping to bypass the local authority&apos;s hostels. In 2000, Chitty took a call from one immigration official who, reviewing case files, discovered that his Gatwick team had released more than 100 Chinese children to the same &quot;uncle&quot;. Unable to interest the police, Chitty eventually traced the man to a north London Chinese takeaway. The intelligence she gleaned went nowhere. Immigration officials conducted no inquiry. The phone numbers were never followed up and Chitty continued to see children vanishing. By 2003, people trafficking was such a global problem that the UN produced a protocol, defining it as a trade that subjugated more than 2.4 million people a year. It called for a unified response, but in western Europe only Denmark, France and Spain signed up at the time. It was not until early 2006 that the British government signed, and established Soca, which made targeting traffickers one of its priorities. Often it is only those spat out by the network who can testify to its existence and many of them find that life on the outside can be just as harsh. Jodie Bourke is a former children&apos;s adviser with the Refugee Council who has assisted 30 teenagers suspected of being trafficked to the UK. She told us: &quot;One heavily pregnant 17-year-old Chinese girl was brought to our attention when she walked into a London hospital. They didn&apos;t want to deal with her. Who was going to pay? It was only after prolonged discussions that the local authority agreed to look after her and we got to sit down and hear how she had been abducted 18 months earlier from her village in south-western China and driven to Russia, where she&apos;d been locked in a hotel room for months and repeatedly raped. Then she was trafficked to the UK and so it went on.&quot; Victims rarely receive any compassion, says Lucy Kralj of the Helen Bamber Foundation, a London-based human rights organisation which works with trafficked women and children. &quot;Most of those we get to see entered the country as children and emerge from the brothels as adults, only to be consigned to Yarl&apos;s Wood immigration removal centre, in Bedfordshire, pending deportation. They are delivered to us for counselling by Group 4 Securicor in caged vans, often surrounded by their own vomit. Recently, two Chinese girls, who had escaped prostitution, were so weak they had to be carried up our stairs by security guards, who then stood behind them throughout the counselling sessions, sealing the exits.&quot; Having seen Chinese women who were so young when they were taken into prostitution that they don&apos;t even know the basics of biology, who feel as if &quot;a viper is eating away inside them&quot;, Kralj says her job has become &quot;believing the unimaginable&quot;. But in the UK, it appears, many in government, social services, immigration and the police are acting as if they have trouble believing at all. \u2022 Additional reporting: Hsiao-Hung Pai"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/13/network-energy", "publicationDate": "2008-10-13T10:10:15Z", "tags": ["Energy", "Sarah Palin", "US elections 2008", "Oil", "US politics"], "sentences": ["According to the Energy Information Administration, more than 95 million barrels of Alaskan oil -- or about 2.7 percent of the total produced in Alaska -- were exported between 1996 and 2004, the majority of it to South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan."], "title": "'Congress is pretty strict on, um, export bans of oil and gas especially'", "article": "On Wednesday, John McCain told Fox News&apos; Sean Hannity that his VP pick Sarah Palin is &quot;probably one of the foremost experts in this nation on energy issues,&quot; and reaffirmed his desire to put her in charge of energy policy in his administration. But on Thursday, Palin once again mangled the facts about energy issues, wrongly asserting to a crowd in Wisconsin that there&apos;s some sort of congressional ban on oil exports. A crowd member told her he had heard that 75 percent of Alaska&apos;s oil is being sold to China, and if that&apos;s true, he wanted to know why. &quot;No. It&apos;s not 75 percent of our oil being exported,&quot; Palin said, suggesting that some of Alaska&apos;s oil is going abroad, but not that much, according to the Associated Press. &quot;In fact, Congress is pretty strict on, um, export bans of oil and gas especially,&quot; she continued. The AP reporter fact-checked the assertion:  No Alaska oil has been exported since 2004, and little if any since 2000, according to the Energy Information Administration and the Congressional Research Service. And Congress has never imposed outright bans on oil exports. Congress prohibited exports of Alaska oil in 1973 when the Alaska oil pipeline was built. But that ban was lifted in 1996 when there were large volumes of Alaska oil coming down from the North Slope and U.S. demand was soft. The Alaska ban has never been reinstated.  Though natural gas exports must be approved by the Energy Department, there isn&apos;t the same stipulation for oil. According to the Energy Information Administration, more than 95 million barrels of Alaskan oil -- or about 2.7 percent of the total produced in Alaska -- were exported between 1996 and 2004, the majority of it to South Korea, Japan, China and Taiwan. The EIA states that there have been no Alaskan oil exports since 2004, but that&apos;s not because of any congressional restriction on exports. This isn&apos;t the first time that Palin has misstated the facts about Alaska and energy supplies. Last month, she claimed that Alaska provides &quot;20 percent&quot; of the nation&apos;s energy. In fact, it provides just 3.5 percent, and several fact-checking sites have since thoroughly debunked her claim. And the natural-gas pipeline she keeps touting as evidence of her success in energy policy? It only exists on paper, and the necessary federal approval is still years away."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/13/creditcrunch-marketturmoil", "publicationDate": "2008-10-13T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["FTSE", "Credit crunch", "Market turmoil", "Banking", "UK news", "Money", "Shares"], "sentences": ["Only stockmarkets in Taiwan and New Zealand were down again."], "title": "FTSE 100 up 8% as world markets rally", "article": "The London stockmarket posted its second highest daily rise ever today, after the  UK government unveiled an injection of \u00a337bn into Britain&apos;s biggest high street banks and eurozone leaders announced a rescue plan overnight. Wall Street also rallied, with the Dow Jones jumping more than 580 points by 1pm EDT as US treasury secretary Hank Paulson prepared to meet US banking bosses amid speculation that a UK-style recapitalisation programme is imminent. With stockmarkets around the world staging rallies after days of nervous trading, the FTSE 100 led the way - closing 324.8 points or 8.26% higher at 4256.9.  This beats the 7.89% bounceback on October 21 1987 following the Black Monday crash. The highest ever rise, 8.84%, was recorded just last month after the $700bn (\u00a3380bn) Wall Street bail-out was first announced. There were also sharp gains in the rest of Europe, with Germany&apos;s Dax and France&apos;s CAC both closing 11% higher. Asian markets bounced back after enduring their worst week for more than 20 years. The Wall Street rally came ahead of a summit between Paulson and the heads of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other major US banks that could see the Treasury follow the example of the UK and other European countries in investing billions of dollars of state funds in beleaguered institutions. Despite speculation that UK banking shares might be suspended, they traded as usual today. Shares in Barclays, which said it would seek to raise \u00a39.5bn of fresh capital from investors without government help, closed 3.7% higher at 215.25p. HSBC, which is not involved in the capital injection, gained 7.5% to 849.25p.  But the three banks that will receive government funding fell. After an early rally Lloyds TSB shares fell 14.5% to 162p, Royal Bank of Scotland lost 8.3% to 66p, and HBOS, the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 today, slumped 27.5% to 90p. The UK government confirmed this morning that it will pump up to \u00a337bn into RBS, Lloyds and HBOS in an attempt to prevent the country&apos;s banking sector from melting down.  After a weekend of negotiations which continued through Sunday night, the Treasury announced the unprecedented rescue plan under which bank bosses face a crackdown on pay and bonuses, and shareholder dividends will be axed. This came after leaders of the 15 eurozone countries unveiled a rescue plan for their troubled banking systems at an emergency summit in Paris last night. The summit followed a frenetic weekend of activity in Washington, in which the IMF, the World Bank, the G7 club of rich western nations and the broader G20 group all called for urgent and coordinated action. The Iceland stock exchange remained closed today. Retail magnate Sir Philip Green jetted to Iceland at the weekend to negotiate a deal with the stricken investment group Baugur to buy up to \u00a31bn of its debts. The billionaire was back in London today but talks continued. The move would give him huge influence over Baugur&apos;s fashion chains, such as House of Fraser, Oasis and Karen Millen.  The Russian stock exchange was suspended again after steep falls when it resumed trading this morning. When trading was halted at 2.30pm BST, the benchmark RTS index was down 6.3% at 791.2 points.  Russia&apos;s London-traded shares soared 16% this morning as oil prices bounced back and the country&apos;s parliament approved an $86bn (\u00a350bn) financial sector rescue plan. Oil climbed by more than $4 to rise above $80 a barrel this morning, after falling nearly $9 to hit the lowest level in over a year on Friday. US crude for November delivery rose $4.28 to $81.98 a barrel. In London, Brent crude gained $3.97 to $78.06 a barrel.

Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng jumped 10.2% to 16312 today after losing more than 7% on Friday. The South Korean stockmarket rose 3.8% to 1288 and Singapore&apos;s Straits Times was up 6.6% at 2076.  In India, the Bombay stock exchange gained 7.6% to 11332 after the Indian finance minister said the government was working on more measures to improve liquidity.

A cartoon in the Australian shows a character saying that western capitalists are looking for eastern socialists to save them. To Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, this is not a joke. He argued during a Radio Australia interview that the steady growth of China&apos;s economy would be extremely helpful for getting Australia out of the financial crisis. According to the International Monetary Fund&apos;s economic forecast published last week, most western countries are facing recession next year, while China&apos;s economy will keep growing at 9%. Rudd believes this is good news for Australia. China&apos;s demands for ore, coal and other materials has fuelled the growth of Australia in the recent years. At the moment, China is Australia&apos;s largest trading partner. Last week&apos;s announcement of interest rates cuts by China was part of a coordinated effort by the world&apos;s central banks. It was seen by most media commentators not as a necessary step to protect China&apos;s financial system, but as a signal showing China&apos;s willingness to take more responsibilities on the international stage. It is obvious to China that in economic, political and diplomatic terms, it is now in good position in relation to Australia, US and Europe. President Hu Jintao told President George Bush in a phone conversation that the success of America&apos;s rescue plan would be good for China as well. However, even if the plan doesn&apos;t work quickly, or the crisis spreads, China is still relatively safe because its financial system is largely isolated from the rest of the world, and its economy is growing steadily. The big drop in commodity prices also means inflationary pressures is partially lessened. In short, the global financial crisis presents China with more opportunities than difficulties. In terms of China&apos;s relationship with Australia, this means not only that China has more bargaining power over the price of raw materials, but it also raises the possibility that Australia will allow more Chinese companies to invest in the commodity industry. In political terms, this means that since winning China&apos;s cooperation is important, Australia will have to pay more attention to China&apos;s stance on Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific issues. From America&apos;s point of view, China&apos;s help is needed to get out of the current crisis. To cope with the economic downturn and high unemployment, America will have to increase its exports to China. One way to do this is to relax some of the unreasonable restraints on exporting to China. The current deficit is partly a result of America&apos;s post-cold war mentality. If the US could get rid of some of its outdated containment policies towards China, and allow the selling of some advanced equipment and technologies, the trade deficit could easily turn to surplus. Unfortunately European policy-makers have the same mentality as their American counterparts. Enjoying cheap imports from China, they complain about the trade deficit; while at the same time they still impose restrictions on exports to China. Under the Labour government, the UK is reluctant to sell China what it thinks are sensitive products. A list by China&apos;s ministry of commerce shows China wants to import but can&apos;t get products, technologies, and patents in the area of aviation, electronic equipment and carbon fibre materials from the UK. What western leaders should see is that in the long term, China will be a partner rather than a potential competitors or even enemy.

The mood darkened after the latest unemployment figures showed another sharp rise, as the impact of the financial crisis was felt across the UK economy.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 733 points as it fell to 8,577.9, a drop of 7.8%. Stocks were dragged down by news that US retail sales suffered their biggest drop in more than three years, heightening fears of a deep recession in the world&apos;s largest economy.  Rio Tinto spread alarm across the mining sector this morning when it warned that demand from China is slowing down. There are already fears that the global financial turmoil will wound the Chinese economy, hitting imports, exports, and demand for raw materials and energy. Last night the Dow closed down 0.8% at 9310 points after the Bush administration reluctantly followed Britain&apos;s lead by investing $250bn (\u00a3143bn) in taking minority stakes in nine leading banks including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Bank of America and Citigroup.  David Evans, market analyst at BetOnMarkets, said: &quot;While some investors might attribute the lower opening in London to profit taking, others are worried that the sagging corporate profits will overshadow the bail-out.&quot;  Christian Gattiker at Bank Julius Baer said the volatility in the markets over the last few days was a &quot;Black Swan&quot; event. &quot;First we had relief when the bank guarantees were agreed, but now we have a haggling process by the banks,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s not a lot to cheer about.&quot; In Japan, the Nikkei index which gained 14% yesterday in its biggest ever one-day jump, closed up another 1% today. Figures showing a 20% surge in imports while exports stagnated heightened fears of recession in Japan&apos;s export-dependent economy. Other Asian markets were more gloomy. Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng fell over 5%, while South Korea&apos;s leading index lost 2%. The Australian stock exchange was down 1%. The Shanghai Composite and the Taiex in Taiwan both fell almost 1%. In India, shares slid 3.5% as finance minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said interbank lending still remained constrained, and the government and the central bank had agreed measures to address the problem. Evans noted that oil has tracked swings in stockmarkets this month as the credit crisis deepened. &quot;Oil traders will have a full plate tomorrow as they await the release of the inventory supplies data. There is a strong possibility that oil will touch the $75 per barrel level before stabilising,&quot; he said.  Oil prices fell to $78 a barrel this morning. Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell 72 cents to $77.91 a barrel then settled at $78.52. &quot;People are worried that the world economy is heading for recession,&quot; said Gerard Rigby, an energy analyst at Fuel First Consulting in Sydney. &quot;The bail-out may save the banks, but companies are still laying off workers and demand is going to suffer.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/oct/16/computing-asus", "publicationDate": "2008-10-15T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Computing", "Marketing & PR", "Advertising", "Media", "Asus"], "sentences": ["Industry giants such as Apple, Dell and HP can turn a notebook launch into a global event, but that&apos;s not the sort of thing a Taiwanese company would normally attempt.", "Taiwan does cheap, not chic.", "That message was spelled out by Stan Shih, the founder of Acer and father of the Taiwanese computer industry.", "&quot;In order to elevate Taiwan to the global business scene with added value, we have to invest in branding right now.", "By contrast, the two giants of Taiwan&apos;s OEM business, Quanta and Compal, who manufacture notebooks for Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo, remain almost unknown.", "But the fear in Taiwan is that OEM contracts could be moved to companies in China, Vietnam and emerging countries which, according to HTC&apos;s founder Peter Chou, are catching up fast.", "The Asus name could soon mean much more than &quot;Big in Taiwan&quot;."], "title": "Asus aims for the 'gorgeous' market", "article": "Industry giants such as Apple, Dell and HP can turn a notebook launch into a global event, but that&apos;s not the sort of thing a Taiwanese company would normally attempt. Taiwan does cheap, not chic. But having what looked like a hot product in the S101 netbook, Asus decided to have a go, and paid to take the world&apos;s tech press to a fashion show in Taipei. The event was somewhat short of chic. And as you&apos;d expect from a first attempt, Asus had a lot to learn about herding recalcitrant journalists. The potential benefits to Asus of pulling off this kind of event are enormous. It is turning itself from a motherboard supplier and contract manufacturer - making portable PCs for other companies - into a tier-one supplier with a global brand name. If it can do that, customers will pay more for its products.  Fashion show function The S101 is a case in point. Asus is becoming known to European consumers following the success of its netbooks, starting with the little Eee PC700 - but what caught the eye was its \u00a3200 price. With the \u00a3449 Eee S101, what catches the eye is that it&apos;s really thin and, as another journalist said, &quot;gorgeous&quot;. It could have been made by, or for, Apple or Sony. It didn&apos;t look out of place in a fashion show. Functionally, the S101 is just an Eee PC 1000 at a higher price. But you might be willing pay extra for something you&apos;d be proud to carry. That message was spelled out by Stan Shih, the founder of Acer and father of the Taiwanese computer industry. At a business seminar in Taipei, reported by Elizabeth Tchii in the Taipei Times, he said the future was in branding, no matter how difficult it was to achieve. &quot;The days of doing OEM and ODM&quot; - making boxes and designs for others to put their own brand name on - &quot;are numbered,&quot; he said. &quot;In order to elevate Taiwan to the global business scene with added value, we have to invest in branding right now. This is our social responsibility.&quot; It&apos;s a path Acer has taken, under the Italian management of Gianfranco Lanci, partly by buying known US brands such as Gateway and Packard Bell. It&apos;s a path China&apos;s Legend, now called Lenovo, has taken by buying IBM&apos;s PC division. But Asus is trying to do it by transforming the company. Jonney Shih, who started Asus in 1989 after a dozen years at Acer, says Asus was intended to be &quot;a small but beautiful company&quot; based on its engineering prowess. It became known for technical innovation in motherboards, but he says the company also tried to make them look beautiful. In 1997, the company went from motherboards into notebooks as an OEM and ODM supplier, then launched products under its own brand name. According to Jonney, the company was named Asus after an engineer suggested Pegasus. He truncated it because he wanted a name that started with an A. They&apos;ve now spun off the OEM and ODM businesses into a separate company called Pegatron, thus using the spare half of the flying horse&apos;s name. Pegatron&apos;s offices are visible from Asus&apos;s doorstep, but the split means Asus isn&apos;t competing directly against its own customers. Again, Asus is following Acer, which split off its OEM business into Wistron on the way to becoming a global brand name. By contrast, the two giants of Taiwan&apos;s OEM business, Quanta and Compal, who manufacture notebooks for Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo, remain almost unknown. But the fear in Taiwan is that OEM contracts could be moved to companies in China, Vietnam and emerging countries which, according to HTC&apos;s founder Peter Chou, are catching up fast.  Of course, brand building doesn&apos;t mean much unless you also have distinctive products, and this isn&apos;t easy in the PC business. Asus is therefore trying to innovate. It is, for example, making power-saving &quot;green&quot; motherboards with low emissions and fewer hazardous chemicals than regulations require. It is trying to outperform the competition with its own Super Hybrid Engine and power-saving technologies. It is experimenting with new designs such as the Eee PC and the tiny Eee Box, a desktop PC that will soon have a battery-powered version. In software, Asus provides the Eee Box and S101 with a Linux-based pre-boot system that enables users to get online and do email without waiting for Windows. With Microsoft, it has taken part in the Vista Velocity and Hero PC programmes, and is optimising XP for the fastest possible startup times. Henry Yeh, general manager of Asus&apos;s notebook business unit, says the company doesn&apos;t slow its machines down with software it&apos;s paid to preinstall: users can install the applications they want via a console. Asus is also innovating by using natural materials for notebook finishes. It tried leather three or four years ago, and designer Michelle Hsiao says it is now working with wood, a process that will culminate in the release of a bamboo notebook. Porsche or Hyundai? Yeh says that Asus has built 200 units to introduce the bamboo notebook to the market, then &quot;we will see customer feedback&quot;. The shift upmarket includes a drive for quality. As Jonathan Tsang, president of sales and marketing, puts it: &quot;Volume is not everything. Quality is everything. We&apos;re trying to make ourselves the most admired enterprise in the digital era.&quot; That&apos;s the company&apos;s new vision. He says: &quot;Do you want to be Porsche or Hyundai?&quot; It goes along with a corporate philosophy that demands Humility and Integrity (&quot;Do not cheat!). Which is a refreshing change from: &quot;Don&apos;t get caught!&quot; Of course, success requires more than quality products, and stepping up marketing and press relations is part of the job. Hauling in jet-lagged journalists from India, Russia, Italy etc is just a start. Asus says it will sell more than 6m notebook PCs this year and 5m netbooks, making it a top five portable supplier with a group turnover of more than $20bn (\u00a311.4bn). The Asus name could soon mean much more than &quot;Big in Taiwan&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2008/oct/16/asus-bamboo", "publicationDate": "2008-10-16T12:42:17Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Computing", "Windows", "Asus"], "sentences": ["In an article in today&apos;s Technology section, Asus aims for the &apos;gorgeous&apos; market, I&apos;ve tried to provide some insight into how Taiwan&apos;s PC business is developing."], "title": "Fancy a bamboo notebook PC?", "article": "In an article in today&apos;s Technology section, Asus aims for the &apos;gorgeous&apos; market, I&apos;ve tried to provide some insight into how Taiwan&apos;s PC business is developing. Basically, some of the leading OEM/ODM suppliers are trying to develop global brand names because the OEM/ODM business -- making systems that sell under names such as Apple, Dell, HP and Lenovo -- can easily be moved to Chinese, Vietnamese and other cheaper manufacturers, leaving you with nothing. One of the keys to having a viable brand name is having innovative products, of which the Asus Eee PC S101 netbook (see Asus launches fashion-friendly Eee S101 MacBook Air killer and Picture special: A fashion-conscious look at the Asus Eee PC S101 launch) is a good example. It invites people to pay a bit more for something that looks and feels much better -- and is noticeably thinner -- than the bog-standard netbook. Asus&apos;s design lab in Taipei has also been experimenting with natural materials that could give notebook PCs a more distinctive appearance. These should stand out from the crowd -- being distinctive both for Asus and its customers -- and could therefore appeal to more upmarket users.Henry Yeh, general manager of Asus&apos;s Notebook Business Unit, describes them as &quot;high sense&quot; products: they should appeal to all your senses, but especially touch. &quot;When you touch a natural material, you feel warmth,&quot; he says.      Asus started with leather, &quot;three or four years ago,&quot; and now has a bamboo model, which I tried in the design lab. It looks much better than I expected, and it certainly feels nicer than the usual plastic/metal notebook.  The design does involve work beyond the veneer: Asus has tried to make sure the handrests stay cool, to protect the material. But how well it will age is anyone&apos;s guess. Yeh says Asus has built 200 units to introduce the bamboo notebook to the market. Then &quot;we will see customer feedback.&quot; It might be worth grabbing one as a collector&apos;s item, and they&apos;d look nice in a design museum.

Prospects for oil and other commodity prices are &quot;difficult to assess&quot;; the credit crunch will affect not only demand but also the supply potential of the economy. But take a step back from these nuanced points and consider the straightforward stuff. The UK economy is entering a recession, said King, and &quot;during the past month, the balance of risks to inflation in the medium term shifted decisively to the downside&quot;. The word &quot;decisively&quot; is the one to focus on. If the risks have shifted to that degree, this month&apos;s half-point cut in interest rates is unlikely to be the last. Even before last night, the money markets were pricing in the probability of a similar cut next month, taking the base rate down to 4%.  Yesterday&apos;s probability now looks a near-certainty. That idea is also encouraged by King&apos;s view that &quot;the age of innocence&quot; - when banks would lend to each other on an unsecured basis for only a small premium over base rate - may never return.  &quot;We now face a long, slow haul to restore lending to the real economy, and hence growth of our economy, to more normal conditions,&quot; said the governor. He was making a broader point, but markets may well interpret the comment as further support for the idea that interest rates could go well below 4%. Why? Well, one way to encourage money to flow around the system is to make its price cheaper. King, the man accused of being overly concerned about &quot;moral hazard&quot;, suddenly sounds like an arch-pragmatist.Overburdened Rob Templeman, the chief executive of Debenhams, has been talking about his &quot;deleveraging initiatives&quot; - paying back debt, in normal speech - for months. Yesterday he unveiled his latest idea. He cut the final dividend from 3.8p per share to 0.5p to save \u00a328m. This is what happens when a reasonably healthy retailer, producing operating profit of \u00a3176m, tries to carry an unhealthy amount of debt, roughly \u00a31bn in the case of Debenhams.  Some 42% of last year&apos;s operating profit was consumed by interest payments, a frightening ratio going into a recession. But Templeman seems to have forgotten how Debenhams placed this millstone around its neck. It was because a private equity crew - of which he was a member - did very well for itself by buying the company, selling its freehold properties and then returning the business to the stock market with a barrel-load of debt. Templeman prefers to brush over this fact. The way he tells it, stock market fashion is somehow to blame. &quot;Previously the market liked the amount of debt we had taken on,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;The market, however, has now changed its mind on debt.&quot; Come on, Mr Templeman, this won&apos;t do. You made a decision about the appropriate capital structure and you were too ambitious. Nor it is clear that your &quot;deleveraging initiatives&quot; are radical enough.  Saving \u00a330m on dividends, cutting \u00a340m from capital expenditure, squeezing costs and working capital may sound dramatic, but last year&apos;s belt-tightening exercises knocked a mere \u00a322m off borrowings. Even on a starvation diet, Debenhams is likely to find itself in 2011-2012 trying to refinance \u00a3700m-\u00a3800m of debt.  And that&apos;s if everything goes well.Prudent indeed Prudential&apos;s shareholders can breathe again. There were no nasties in yesterday&apos;s figures and the capital surplus of \u00a31.2bn comfortably met expectations. Talk of an imminent rights issue to shore up the balance sheet can be dismissed; the corporate bond market would have to weaken considerably before the Pru was forced to tap shareholders. Meanwhile, the operations in Asia, with the exception of Taiwan, continue to deliver strong flows of new business. The UK business is even perking up. Better, chief executive Mark Tucker is in control of his senses: he is looking at opportunities presented by the implosion of AIG, his chief rival in Asia, but knows that funding a multibillion-pound acquisition would be tricky when the Pru&apos;s shares are trading around 350p, rather than the 500p seen in the summer. Realism reigns. As long as that remains so, the Pru looks a decent bet at today&apos;s level. A purchase of bits of AIG at a knock-down price could clearly make sense, given the scope for cost savings. But it would be worrying if sovereign wealth funds were ushered in to fund a deal that existing shareholders would regard as too adventurous. Tucker, thankfully, seems to accept the point. Despite the past week&apos;s excitements, the script at the Pru looks reassuringly dull.  nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/22/economy-economics", "publicationDate": "2008-10-22T15:00:00Z", "tags": ["Economic policy", "Economics", "Credit crunch", "Global recession", "World news", "UK news"], "sentences": ["This is why all of today&apos;s rich countries \u2013 starting from 18th century Britain and 19th century US and Germany, down to late 20th century South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 did not first invest in education and skills in general and then developed new industries."], "title": "Ha-Joon Chang: I agree with much of Jeffrey Sachs' proposals for Bretton Woods II, with some serious caveats", "article": "In setting out his agenda for Bretton Woods II, Professor Jeffrey Sachs has gone far. He proposes a Tobin tax \u2013 a tax that has been a bete noire of the international financial industry and hence the rich country&apos;s, especially US, governments. His rejection of emission trading in favour of a straightforward carbon tax is also bold \u2013 and in my view correct.  There are many things, however, that he could have added in relation to the reform of the international financial system. For example, he could have proposed the introduction of a country bankruptcy code that will enable orderly sovereign debt restructuring. He could have talked not only of expanding the capital adequacy requirement, but also making it counter-cyclical, rather than pro-cyclical as it currently is. More strict regulations of tax havens and private equity funds, which have greatly contributed to increasing opacity in the financial market, should also have been mentioned. He could also have talked about the credit rating agencies. In light of the critical role they play in today&apos;s financial system and the damages they have inflicted by blessing all those toxic assets, these agencies need to be much more heavily regulated or even replaced by an international public body. All of these would have been compatible with his overall approach, so the differences between us in this regard are a matter of emphasis rather than of principles.  However, I have some disagreements with Sachs&apos;s vision of how to reform the IMF, the World Bank, and the world trading system.  As for Sachs&apos;s proposal to turn the IMF into a proper lender-of-last-resort, I fear that a vastly strengthened IMF without a serious reform of its missions and its governance structure is likely to make things even worse. The IMF has caused great damage to developing (and former socialist) economies that have come under its tutelage by insisting on deflationary macroeconomic policies and premature financial de-regulation and opening up. Without abandoning these policies, an expanded IMF will be even more capable of inflicting damages on its client countries.  Of course, the IMF has been able to continue with these problematic policies because the suffering countries do not have much say in the running of the organisation. Therefore, the voting shares in the IMF (and in the World Bank) need to be re-distributed in favour of developing countries. This is partly to reflect the dramatic changes in international economic power balances since its foundation, but more importantly to increase the voice of the &quot;customers&quot; (mostly developing countries), when there is no competitor to whom dissatisfied customers can turn. I am also not persuaded by Sachs&apos;s development strategy. I am all in favour of achieving the millennium development goals as soon as possible, but, unlike what its middle name suggests, the MDG is mainly about providing basic needs (health, education, and poverty reduction) and little about development in the true sense of the world \u2013 expansion and upgrading a country&apos;s productive capabilities. True, making individuals more productive through better health and education will increase a country&apos;s productive capabilities, but there is only so much that can be achieved through individual improvements. A lot of productive capabilities in modern economies need to be accumulated in the form of organisational routines and institutional memories in (public, private, and cooperative) productive enterprises through actual production experiences. To put it graphically, what really distinguish the US or Germany, on the one hand, and the Philippines or Nigeria, on the other hand, are their Boeings and Volkswagens, and not their economists or medical doctors. The achievement of the MDGs is a noble goal in itself, but it is not the same as development. Even more problematic is Sachs&apos;s support for &quot;aid for trade&quot; deal. In this deal, developing countries are asked to liberalise their trade in order to get the additional foreign aid that will enable them to make extra investment in skills and infrastructure. However, trade liberalisation will destroy, and make it very difficult to newly set up in the future, the very locales of accumulation of productive capabilities, namely, productive enterprises in high-productivity industries. This is why all of today&apos;s rich countries \u2013 starting from 18th century Britain and 19th century US and Germany, down to late 20th century South Korea and Taiwan \u2013 did not first invest in education and skills in general and then developed new industries. They first set up new enterprises with the help of (intelligently used, of course) protectionism and subsidies and then went on to invest in skills and technologies that those industries needed, as I document in my book, Bad Samaritans. Asking the developing countries to give up those policy tools is telling them to give up development. We need a more wide-ranging and more productivity-oriented approach than Sachs&apos;s, if we want to make the global system more productive, durable, and equitable."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/25/lezard", "publicationDate": "2008-10-24T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Science and nature", "Books", "Paperbacks"], "sentences": ["(Which should help you forgive the mangled English that occasionally comes out of those countries, like the sign in a Taiwan hotel apologising for the closure of the swimming pool: &quot;Because of rainy day."], "title": "Review: Proust and the Squid by Maryanne Wolf", "article": "If you&apos;re reading this section of the paper, then there&apos;s a good chance you like reading.

The swimming pool pause opens! The inconvenient forgives please HouseKeeping department&quot;.) Or that, because of the language&apos;s eccentricities, children take a year longer to read English than they do when they learn Italian, German, or Finnish?  We take our reading skills for granted, but we shouldn&apos;t; and this book tells us what&apos;s going on in our brains when we read. (When I say it is a very brainy book, I am being literal as well as figurative: the book is crammed with drawings of brains, with areas given such imposing names as supramarginal gyrus or occipital-temporal area. Do not let these put you off.) It begins with the arresting proclamation: &quot;We were never born to read.&quot; That is, there is nothing in our genetic makeup that determines literacy, in the way that there is something which determines how we digest, or see, or move. Reading involves getting two halves of the brain to work together: to get the part that sees and the part that talks to cooperate.  Sometimes they don&apos;t - and if you don&apos;t learn to read, your mind works differently. Portuguese scientists examined two different groups of rural dwellers: those who had been educated to read as children, and those who had managed to bypass that stage. They could both speak the language, of course, but when the non-readers were asked to repeat nonsense words like &quot;benth&quot; they would find it hard, and try to substitute similar-sounding words that actually meant something, like &quot;birth&quot;. You or I might question the utility of getting a Portuguese peasant to say the word &quot;benth&quot;, or its equivalent in Portuguese, but that is the kind of thing scientists get up to - and the research can have surprising implications.  This book is so thought-provoking that at times it feels as if one is being overloaded. Yet it is - except for some of the stuff about the supramarginal gyrus - quite easy to read. That, probably, is why it is so stimulating. Wolf covers a lot of ground very quickly. (As for the title: &quot;Proust&quot; stands for the reading brain, &quot;the squid&quot; for the anatomical study of nerve reflexes.) We zip from cuneiform (the initial great literate achievement) to Socrates, who was deeply suspicious of reading, which he said stifled independent thought: he attacked people who think &quot;like papyrus rolls, being able neither to answer your questions nor to ask themselves&quot;. Well, thanks to Plato&apos;s writing down Socrates&apos;s words, we still have his objections to hand; but, as Wolf points out, Socrates&apos;s fears for the future of thought are very similar to our own fears for our children in the face of the instant-retrieval revolution of the internet.  If there is a continuous underlying theme in the book, it is, indeed, about the education of children. At what age should they start being taught to read? What&apos;s the best way to help them? (Read them poetry. It helps them distinguish phonemes.) Is the internet stunting their intellectual growth? (Probably not, but let us be vigilant.) And - she really goes into this in depth - what&apos;s the best way to deal with dyslexia? (I will not summarise her arguments and insights here, but the gist is that dyslexia is not necessarily bad news.) And the great thing we learn about reading is that, as we age, it just gets better and better. Describing her experience of reading Middlemarch half a dozen times - which itself bespeaks a high level of commitment to the written word - she winningly admits that she now sees things she didn&apos;t before: &quot;I never thought I would see the day when I empathised with Mr Casaubon but now, with no small humility, I see that I do.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/25/stripping-domestic-assets-lucy-mangan", "publicationDate": "2008-10-24T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Life and style"], "sentences": ["&quot;Or your futures for a handful of unseasonal asparagus from Taiwan?&quot; Now look."], "title": "Lucy Mangan on thriftily stripping domestic assets", "article": "When I was in New York at the beginning of the year (how glamorous I sound!

This is a collection of about 15 buildings dating from the 1700s onwards. They aren&apos;t all originally Richmond buildings. Some of them were bussed in from elsewhere to plump things out a bit and make preservation and sightseeing easier. This is an attitude I think we would do well to embrace in England. Think how much happier everyone would be if we could divide up the country according to taste and convenience. Reforest the north-west, split everything from 1500 to 1950 between the top right and bottom left quadrants, and dump all the modern stuff into the south-east on the grounds that once the Olympic planners have shat all over Stratford, you might as well finish off the job. Natives can live in and tourists can visit the quarter that most pleases them and our new streamlined efficiency will make us Top Nation once again.  But that is a dream for another day. My story continues on Staten Island, where I met a real-life cooper, who was working away with real-life 19th-century tools to make barrels, stools, rolling pins and everything else for which your inner Laura Ingalls Wilder has ever hankered. As he planed and turned and whittled before an enraptured audience, he told us how, when the western states were being settled, laws were brought in to stop people burning down their log cabins when they left (either to press pioneeringly on further west, or because they were big jessies who wanted to return home to the cities full of mod cons such as streets and boughten hats). And why were people setting fire to their homes in such numbers that legislation had to be passed to stop the states being for ever desettled? &quot;They burned them,&quot; he said, &quot;in order to get back the iron nails they had used to build them. Timber was everywhere and any man knew how to make a cabin. But a handful of iron nails - that was precious.&quot; I had hoped that I would have a few years before this vivid illustration of the changing face of economics, the inherent rather than intrinsic values and, y&apos;know, the mutability of all things, would take on personal relevance. I had hoped to rework it for grandchildren, perhaps, when they are trading hydroponic saplings or oxygen vials for medical care or unscorched land. &quot;Did I tell you about the time when we would exchange money for clothes at Primark?&quot; I was planning to chortle. &quot;Or your futures for a handful of unseasonal asparagus from Taiwan?&quot; Now look. Just nine months after the ferry deposited me on Staten Island, the world financial system resembles nothing so much as the massive toxic dump for which the NYC outpost is equally justly famed, and I am having to look with narrowed eyes at my own home, trying to work out if it or anything therein could be reconfigured as an asset. Should I sell the copper piping from the boiler for scrap? Is there lead in a 70s roof? Will there ever be a market for used cat litter or old bus tickets? How many nails does a fiscal coffin need?

Earlier this year, BG&apos;s ambitions in the region suffered a setback when its hostile offer for another Australian gas producer, Origin Energy, was rebuffed. But yesterday it looked poised to succeed in capturing QGC. BG already owns a near 10% stake in the Australian company and said that it had acceptances or declarations of intent that would give it 57% of its bid target. BG&apos;s chief executive, Frank Chapman, said the A$5.75 (\u00a32.25) a share cash offer was a good deal for both companies &quot;with BG gaining the opportunity to invest in the long-term growth of upstream production and QGC shareholders gaining a certain and fair cash premium&quot;. In a research note, Morgan Stanley analysts said the price BG was paying to increase its own supplies was &quot;substantially lower&quot; than other recent deals in the sector and said it &quot;addresses the long-held view that BG was short equity gas in Asia as it grows its integrated LNG business&quot;.  Ivor Ries at EL &amp; C Baillieu Stockbroking said the deal was a fair price for QGC. &quot;It is definitely hard to see anyone coming over the top for QGC.&quot; BG said the acquisition of QGC, for which it is paying an 80% premium to the last traded price, would be a step change in the scale of its Asia-Pacific operations. Although energy prices have been volatile recently on fears that the global credit crunch will hit demand, analysts believe that in the longer term, demand for LNG in the Asia-Pacific region will grow by 20% to 126m tonnes a year by 2010 and to just above 200m tonnes by 2020. Chapman said: &quot;The LNG business is a long-term business. In the long term, LNG demand is going to grow powerfully.&quot; The company already supplies customers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, India and China. It is planning to add Hong Kong, Chile and Singapore in the coming years. BG already has a partnership with QGC to build an LNG plant in Queensland that would use the Australian company&apos;s reserves of coal-seam gas - a natural gas produced when organic matter is turned into coal. CSG can be turned into LNG and then shipped to market. A number of other leading energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Petronas and ConocoPhillips have bought into LNG projects in Australia. BG said its offer was final, unless a higher rival offer emerged, and would be financed from its cash reserves and existing borrowing facilities if required. BG shares rose 46.5p, or 7%, to 710.5p in a buoyant energy sector."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/oct/29/television-last-nights-tv", "publicationDate": "2008-10-29T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Television", "Television industry", "Culture", "Media", "Television & radio"], "sentences": ["But the official explanation is that, after it died, the gases inside started to build up, and then as it was being transported by lorry to the university in Taiwan for a postmortem, it started to get warmer and warmer until ...

One day after figures come out showing that beer sales have slumped by 1.8m pints a day since last year, the Men Behaving Badly actor does a programme about buying a pub with his mate Richard and getting into brewing. I know it was filmed a while ago, but still it&apos;s strangely in character for Neil, who seems to be blessed with more boyish enthusiasm than business acumen. And, actually, it totally fits in with the whole premise of the show. &quot;Anyone choosing to get involved in this ailing [is that a joke - ailing/ale-ing?] industry would have to be mad,&quot; says Hugh Bonneville, narrating.  Cut to Neil and his mate in the car. &quot;Wahey!&quot; says Neil, making the internationally recognised sign for wanker at another driver, and then he and Richard collapse in a fit of the giggles. It&apos;s been a while since MBB, and Neil looks less boyish than he did. But the behaviour isn&apos;t any less bad - he&apos;s still just a big boy who does rude signs and says &quot;Wahey!&quot; a lot.  That&apos;s how this show goes. Wahey, let&apos;s buy a pub and make beer! Beer! Wahey! How do you make beer? Dunno. Oops. Let&apos;s drink lots of beer first.  Wahey, drink lots of beer! And have a bath in it! And fart in the bath of beer! Parp! Wahey! And now make our own beer! Look, we made our own beer! Let&apos;s drink it, and go on a road trip with a caravan, and do wanker signs, and lose the beer, and find it, and drink it, and buy a pub. Beer! Parp! Pub! Beer! Wahey!  There&apos;s something quite dated and 1990s and Gallagher brothers about this kind of laddishness. But it&apos;s still quite charming. Neil is, too - a man destined never to grow up. Wahey! I totally changed my mind about The Troubles I&apos;ve Seen (ITV1) during the programme. Originally my thinking was something along the lines of: Eamonn Holmes chats to his famous pals from Northern Ireland about the Troubles? What the hell is this - I&apos;m a Celebrity, Blow Me Up? Why does everything have to involve celebrities? Isn&apos;t there anyone who didn&apos;t become a DJ or an actor, a comedian or whatever, who might tell the story better? But in fact, they were all so incredibly good - Jimmy Nesbitt on the car-bomb that went off next to his car; Charlie Lawson on nearly becoming a loyalist paramilitary instead of Jim McDonald in Corrie; Gloria Hunniford on covering the aftermath of a big bomb as a young reporter in Belfast; Patrick Kielty on the murder of his father. Holmes was great too, on growing up amid all that fear and mistrust, hatred and terror.  It&apos;s amazing how incredibly impressive people become when they talk about things that really matter to them. I totally forgave them for being celebrities. And together, their stories added up to a neat little refresher course on the Troubles - just in case you&apos;d forgotten who was and wasn&apos;t welcome on the Falls and the Shankill Roads, for example. A powerful and thoughtful film.  At least it was just bombs exploding though, not large aquatic mammals, which is what we got in The Whale That Blew Up in the Street (Five). It sounds like a spoof, or a game of Let&apos;s Think of Stupid Makey-Uppy Channel Five Documentary Names (have a go - it&apos;s quite a good one for car journeys). But, amazingly, this is a real programme about a real event. Also amazing is that - although the event itself lasted about a second and no one was killed or even hurt - they somehow managed to make an hour of television out of it. And, most amazing of all, it was actually quite interesting.  Turns out the whale was probably hit by a ship, which is why the tissue around its dorsal fin was weakened. (I maintain it was terrorism, and I&apos;m pleased to see some people on the internet agree.) But the official explanation is that, after it died, the gases inside started to build up, and then as it was being transported by lorry to the university in Taiwan for a postmortem, it started to get warmer and warmer until ... Boom! Whale insides outside - all over the cars and the shops, so that the whole street was deep in blood and guts, like a horror movie. The whale really did blow up in the street!

But in Illinois this election cycle, no one not running for office himself has given more to the nation&apos;s federal campaigns than Shi Sheng Hao, a virtual unknown in business and political circles. Before September 2007, Hao&apos;s name had never appeared in the 15-year-old federal database of campaign contributors. Since then, however, his donations have topped $120,000 - including $70,100 on a single June day to Republican presidential candidate John McCain. Over the same time frame, a network of Hao relatives has kicked in more. The take from this group over the last 13 months exceeds $269,000, most of it to McCain and the Republican National Committee, records show. Hao didn&apos;t register to vote at the north-west suburban address attached to his donations until October 2007, a month after he wrote his first political check, $25,000 to the RNC. The circumstances surrounding Hao&apos;s sudden and prolific political activism are curious and his whereabouts unclear. His name isn&apos;t listed on property records or the mailbox at the unassuming tract home listed on his donations. Hao lives &quot;overseas&quot;, insisted a man who answered the door at the Roselle home recently. The man declined to identify himself. The story of Hao - whose varied roster of business associates appears to include a Taiwanese government investment arm as well as the mastermind of a decade-old Democratic fundraising scandal - is an eyebrow-raiser in the current election climate. Ethnic Chinese donors became an issue in the battle for the Democratic nomination last year because some didn&apos;t seem to live where they claimed on contribution records. Now, Republicans are raising questions about the authenticity of many small donations Democrat Barack Obama has received from abroad. Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics, said the timing of the Hao-related contributions appeared troubling, though there could be a plausible explanation. &quot;Large contributions from people who have never given previously do generally provoke questions about who they are and what they&apos;re up to and most importantly, what they&apos;re looking for,&quot; said Krumholz, whose non-partisan group closely tracks political donations. &quot;The public needs to be concerned because there are fraudulent donations and persons use them to gain influence and access in Washington.&quot; McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said Hao was not a &quot;major donor&quot; and &quot;not a part of this campaign in terms of fundraising,&quot; but declined to discuss him further or address the campaign&apos;s procedures for vetting donors. RNC spokesman Danny Diaz said he would not respond to questions from the Tribune, contending the newspaper was biased against McCain. So who is Shi Sheng Hao and what are his means and motives for becoming a mega-donor? No one answers a telephone listed in his name in the 630 area code and there&apos;s no answering machine. Messages left for him by phone and email with several relatives went unanswered. But this much can be gleaned from public records: Donation disclosures list his occupation as a businessman with entities identified only by slightly different acronyms: ADECC, AAEC, A.A.E.C.C. On some he is also listed as president of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd. Hao and his wife, Hsin-Ning, declared bankruptcy in 1995, at the time using the Roselle, Ill., home as an address and listing as a business a firm called Asian American Environmental Control. Hao holds an Illinois driver&apos;s license that lists his address as the Roselle home, but property records show the four-bedroom house has been owned since 1992 by Robert and Jen Chi and their last name is on the mailbox. Contacted at the Des Plaines marketing firm where she works, Jen Chi said she didn&apos;t want to discuss Hao, though she said she knew how to get in touch with him and would have him call the Tribune. He never did. &quot;I don&apos;t know anything about his business,&quot; said Chi, who herself gave $15,000 to the RNC the week after Hao&apos;s first donation. &quot;I don&apos;t want to be stuck in the middle.&quot; Hao&apos;s wife, Hsin-Ning, also used the Roselle address when she made a $25,000 contribution to the RNC last year. In September, however, she listed a Taipei address on a $2,300 contribution to the campaign fund of former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. There is no record in business databases of American Chinese Entertainment Ltd, the firm listed in some Hao donation records. However, an Asian American Entertainment Corp, was incorporated early this year in California with a Shi Sheng Hao as president. Government records show that firm and at least two other Hao companies have connections to the family of Gene and Nora Lum, onetime prominent Democratic fundraisers in the Asian-American community who were convicted in 1997 of making political donations through illegal straw donors. A Taiwanese firm with a nearly identical name as Hao&apos;s new California company, Asian American Entertainment Ltd, is also headed by a Shi Sheng Hao. That firm has been embroiled in a lengthy legal battle in Las Vegas over a soured partnership in an application for a casino license in Macau, the former Portuguese colony now part of the People&apos;s Republic of China. A court filing in that case described Hao&apos;s firm as a business affiliate of the China Industrial Development Bank, a finance arm of the Taiwanese government. Hao is listed as a resident of Taiwan in corporate papers filed in the case. It is not clear whether the Shi Sheng Hao in the lawsuit and the California ventures is the same Shi Sheng Hao using the Roselle address. But public records point to numerous coincidences, including corporations with similar names and an overlap of investors. Some political donations from the Roselle address also refer to Hao by a nickname, Marshall, the same nickname given for Hao in the Las Vegas court action. Federal records indicate a pattern of large and coordinated donations from Hao, relatives and associates. Collectively, eight of them gave a total of $130,000 to the RNC in late September to early October of last year. LOOPHOLEGiven federal contribution limits, how can Shi Sheng Hao give $70,100 to John McCain? In general, individuals are barred from giving more than $2,300 to the main fundraising committee of presidential candidates in a primary race and another $2,300 in a general election. But the law has a loophole exploited by Democrats and Republicans alike. Barack Obama and John McCain each control what are called joint fundraising committees that are allowed to put the arm on individual donors for tens of thousands of dollars. Between them, Obama and McCain have raised $300 million that way. The joint committees act as funnels, distributing money they raise to other political committees which, by law, aren&apos;t allowed to coordinate with each other on how the funds are spent. That&apos;s a feeble restriction since experienced political operatives know how to promote a candidate without comparing notes with colleagues, said Massie Ritsch, of the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/oct/30/2", "publicationDate": "2008-10-30T00:01:00Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["It was March last year and we were chatting in rehearsal about how the Taiwanese-born contemporary dancer Wan-Chen Chang planned to spend her 30th birthday.", "Prior to moving to the UK, Wan-Chen was for five years a member of the Lyn-Yong Dance Company in Taiwan, during which time she toured in Italy, Spain and Germany.", "She graduated in dance at the Chinese Culture University, Taiwan, in 1999."], "title": "Obituary: Wan-Chen Chang", "article": "It was March last year and we were chatting in rehearsal about how the Taiwanese-born contemporary dancer Wan-Chen Chang planned to spend her 30th birthday.

Tragically, she has suffered fatal injuries in a cycling accident, aged 31. Wan-Chen came to London from Newcastle-upon-Tyne with her husband, Dr William McGuinness. In the short time she was in the capital, she came to know a wide number of people through dancing for Cloud Dance, the Sylvia Ferreira Dance Company, Katie Thies Dance Theatre (ktdt), and KorsnesKompani, and classes at Laban and Greenwich Dance Agency, in south London. Everyone was struck by her warm and funny personality - and her exceptional beauty. Last year, through Cloud Dance, she performed at Sadlers Wells&apos;s Open Connect festival and at the first Cloud Dance festival at Chisenhale Dance Space in Bow, east London. She toured with the Sylvia Ferreira company in Marks That Behold (2007-08) and as part of Meet Me in the ... Evening in March this year. As one of a company of seven dancers, she performed with ktdt in Black Swan Moments in Resolution! at The Place last February.

And if both of these take big slices of the smartphone market, that leaves less for everybody else \u2013 unless they can find a way to respond. Research In Motion (RIM) is already in motion: it has spent the past couple of years moving into the consumer market with hot new products such as the BlackBerry Bold and Storm. Nokia, the world&apos;s largest phonemaker, has targeted high-end users with the E71, N95 and N96 and similar phones. Nokia has also taken control of the Symbian smartphone operating system and is making that open source as well. Meanwhile, Microsoft has ... done not very much at all.  &quot;We&apos;re very confident in our strategy, so I don&apos;t think we need a particular response,&quot; says Alex Reeve, who heads up the Windows Mobile business in the UK.  But while Microsoft sold 18m smartphone licences in the year to June, 2m short of its target, Apple says it sold 6.9m iPhones during the last quarter alone. As the iPhone goes global, it&apos;s not hard to see it outselling Microsoft&apos;s 50+ handset manufacturers combined. It&apos;s also not hard to see many of those 50+ handset manufacturers at least trying Android as well. Microsoft is in a tricky position because, like Google, it doesn&apos;t make phones. It supplies an operating system that anyone can license, but ultimately it&apos;s reliant on partners who may have other ideas.  Taiwan&apos;s HTC, for example, has been a major manufacturer of Windows Mobile phones, but now it&apos;s making G1 Googlephones as well.  Windows Mobile can&apos;t even rely on its parent, Microsoft to give it a market advantage. Phones running Windows Mobile were the first to offer good synchronisation with Microsoft Exchange, which is the standard corporate email server, and this gave Windows Mobile an advantage in the business market. However, Microsoft has since licensed Exchange sync to rival handset-makers including Palm, Nokia and Apple.  Locked market Reeve says: &quot;We&apos;ve taken the approach that we want as many people to have access to Exchange as possible. We have absolute confidence in our ability to sell our mobile product without locking people in.&quot; Of course, Microsoft still has advantages for corporate use. Ken Dulaney at Gartner, the leading analyst covering handhelds and smartphones, points out that all the systems that were designed for warehouse and factory floor use run Windows Mobile. Also, companies can develop their own applications using Microsoft Visual Studio \u2013 which they already use to develop PC applications \u2013 and install those applications however they like.  &quot;We&apos;d never lock people in like the iPhone,&quot; says Reeve. &quot;The whole point of a smartphone, in the Microsoft philosophy, is to make it open to applications, so everybody can build the solutions they really want.&quot; Google&apos;s Android software is open-source (it&apos;s based on Linux) and free, so it could also challenge Microsoft as an open application platform. But Reeve doesn&apos;t think the G1 is a threat. &quot;It has no integration at all with the enterprise,&quot; he says, and Google has a &quot;kill switch&quot; so it can erase software that you load on the device. According to Dulaney, Microsoft had a choice with Windows Mobile 6: it could either &quot;defend their enterprise turf against RIM&quot;, or focus on improving the user interface and attack the consumer market where the iPhone was making headway. &quot;In either case, they were going to suffer,&quot; says Dulaney.  &quot;I think they chose the right thing, which was to defend the enterprise area, where they&apos;re strong,&quot; he says. Reeve, however, rejects the idea that Microsoft has been slipping in the consumer market. &quot;We&apos;re growing very quickly in that area,&quot; he says.  He points to the HTC Diamond, HTC Touch HD, Samsung Omnia and the Xperia X1 \u2013 Sony Ericsson&apos;s first Windows Mobile phone \u2013 as being stylish designs with consumer appeal. A hit product can change everything, at least for a while. Stylish hardware does not necessarily come with stylish software, of course, and Windows Mobile has come in for plenty of criticism. Dulaney says Microsoft has &quot;different priorities \u2013 a passion for developers&quot;, but lacks Apple&apos;s passion for the user interface (UI). &quot;They just don&apos;t have the genes,&quot; he says. Face to face The hardware suppliers and network operators can do something about that by changing the UI, as Palm has done, or by adding their own interface, as HTC did with TouchFLO. So far, however, nothing has come close to the iPhone.  Whether Microsoft will be able to do that with Windows Mobile 7 remains to be seen: Reeve says Microsoft isn&apos;t commenting. But in the long run, the real question is whether Microsoft cares. If Windows Mobile sells 20m licences a year at a hypothetical $7 to $8 (\u00a34.50 to \u00a35) each, that&apos;s only $140m to $160m, which isn&apos;t as much as a decent Xbox 360 game. It&apos;s a very long way from the $4.6bn that Apple reckons the iPhone generated in the last quarter alone.  Still, Microsoft isn&apos;t likely to drop out of the mobile phone market, for two reasons. First, there&apos;s value in the way Windows Mobile fits into Microsoft&apos;s whole enterprise business, supporting Microsoft Office, Exchange and its Live web sites. Second, Windows Mobile isn&apos;t a standalone system, it&apos;s just one example of a software stack based on Windows CE, alongside PocketPC and Windows Automotive. CE has been used in thousands of products including set-top boxes, petrol pumps, jukeboxes and even sewing machines.  Given the scale of the investment in Windows CE, and Microsoft&apos;s ambitions in the consumer electronics area, Microsoft must surely keep it going. What I think we are likely to see, under the Windows not Walls slogan, is Microsoft moving to a broader &quot;platform play&quot;. Instead of focusing on particular products, Microsoft could present Windows as a more interoperable offering for the 2010s.  The platform will have three legs - Windows 7, Windows Mobile 7 and Windows Live - with Live Mesh rings automatically synchronising data as required across all your devices. (If you want to play with Live Mesh, sign up for the beta.)  Applications such as email, messaging and word processing will be available on all devices, and also online at Windows Live, with the two working together. You can take your pick about which you prefer at any given time, because they&apos;ll interoperate. In the ring It sounds like a good plan \u2013 but then, so did the Windows CE strategy in the early 1990s. However, even the best plans can fail if the execution isn&apos;t up to scratch, and sometimes things just don&apos;t work out the way anyone might expect. For example, starting in the late 1990s, Microsoft has spent the thick end of a decade establishing its own mobile platform. It can&apos;t have imagined being overtaken by a late entrant such as Apple&apos;s iPhone. It surely couldn&apos;t have imagined being challenged by a phone from a search engine company, Google, that barely existed at the time. Bill Gates met similar challenges in 1995 when he made Microsoft do a U-turn on the internet, performed with unexpected agility and speed. Whether Steve Ballmer can do it remains to be seen."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/02/1", "publicationDate": "2008-11-02T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["World news"], "sentences": ["Taiwan accepts pandas China and Taiwan plan to exchange rare animals in a sign of their increasingly warm ties, according to a Taiwanese negotiator.", "China will give Taiwan two pandas and will receive two of the island&apos;s Formosan serows - goat-like animals - in return.", "China first offered the pandas in 2005, but the gifts were turned down by the Taiwanese government, which said they were part of Chinese efforts to persuade the island to unify with the mainland."], "title": "World news in brief", "article": "ANC tries to crush breakaway party The party that has governed South Africa since apartheid has gone to court to slap down its biggest threat in decades - a splinter faction that could undermine its huge support base.

Instead, its affluent students are regular targets for attack and attempted kidnappings in an increasingly unstable Kabul. Some now believe foreign forces should leave and the Taliban come back into government. &quot;I think we have almost reached the point of no return. There are no good solutions left,&quot; said Ali Padsha, 19, who was raised in America. &quot;The longer foreign forces stay, the more problems will be created. When we [Afghans] see foreign forces in our country, it makes us crazy, it always has. &quot;The new Taliban are smarter than before and not as hardcore. They know what to do to keep the people happy.&quot; Seven years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan, the situation is deteriorating rapidly. &quot;The rivers are running backwards,&quot; has become a popular lament in Kabul, whose residents are now looking to a change of leadership in America as the starting point for change in Afghanistan. Afghans generally favour Barack Obama. Some like him because he is the son of a Muslim, affectionately referring to him as Hussein Jan, adding Jan (an Afghan term of endearment) to his middle name. Many educated Afghans believe he has a more nuanced understanding of the regional predicament and support his plans to get tough with Pakistan. But others are cynical, seeing no difference between the candidates and viewing both men&apos;s commitment to sending more troops with hostility. Afghans face elections next year and are aware that the new American leader will play a defining role in determining who will be the next Afghan president.  &quot;Whoever takes over America must bring a new leadership to Afghanistan,&quot; says Fahim Dashti, the editor of the popular Kabul Weekly. The victor will also have to work to counter the country&apos;s rampant anti-Americanism. &quot;The US has failed on everything they said they would do,&quot; says Dashti, a popular and influential thinker who fought with the Northern Alliance supported by America to drive out the Taliban in 2001. &quot;They said they were going to get rid of the Taliban - now the Taliban are at the edges of the city and even operating inside Kabul itself. They said they were going to end opium production but there is more opium than ever being produced. They said they were going to bring democracy but what we have is more like a dictatorship. Most people live beneath the poverty line and there is mass unemployment.&quot; Ali and his university friends are sympathetic to the incoming president. &quot;I feel bad for whoever wins this election,&quot; he said. &quot;They are going to have a really hard job cleaning up the mess left by the previous administration.&quot;Clancy Chassay Paris: &apos;Obama is France&apos;s ideal of the American dream&apos; Paris&apos;s Rue La Fayette, named after the great French hero of American independence, is known for its hordes of shopping US tourists. But struggling bars, hotels and even famous department stores are lamenting a fall in trade as US tourist numbers in Paris shrink to a record low. &quot;Business is down, we&apos;re all suffering,&quot; said Lionel Pinheiro, a waiter at one bistro. &quot;If Obama wins, I hope it might ease the financial crisis and bring the tourists back.&quot; Liberal Americans abroad have grown tired of having to apologise for their nationality during the Bush years. But France is now wondering: is it OK to start loving Americans again? &quot;We don&apos;t lynch Americans in the street,&quot; said Charlotte Lepri, a US specialist at the French thinktank, Institute for Research in Integrated Strategies (IRIS). &quot;But there are certain associations with Bush. Now there is a turnaround and real enthusiasm for a black candidate who represents France&apos;s ideal of the American dream.&quot; This new optimism could make it easier for the pro-US French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, to deepen rapprochement with Washington if Obama is elected. The latest poll shows over 70% of French people would vote for Obama.  So great is the myth surrounding Obama, that some analysts warn the public could be in for a shock. The war in Afghanistan, France&apos;s increase in troops there and the growing death toll have unsettled public opinion. But few appear to realise that an Obama presidency will ask for more military involvement from allies. &quot;I don&apos;t think all French voters are aware of this part of his project, and they are going to get a surprise,&quot; said Jacques Mistral of the French Institute of International Relations (IFRI).Angelique Chrisafis Baghdad: &apos;The Republicans must finish their commitment&apos; Dr Amira Edan al-Dabab, above, has spent the past five years picking up the pieces of Iraq&apos;s plundered past and fears the results may again be lost if America elects Barack Obama. Since the fall of Baghdad in 2003, Edan, the director of the Iraqi Heritage and Antiquities Directorate, has been travelling the globe in search of up to 15,000 looted relics that used to comprise the essence of the National Museum of Iraq, treasures from three millennia which etched Iraq&apos;s place in the Arab heartland. Through half a decade of occupation, several years of brutal insurgency and attempts at sectarian cleansing, Iraq has seen tens of thousands of people killed, and at least two million leave. Security has improved and so too have prospects for some. But throughout Baghdad, many like Edan believe the country could again find itself at the edge of the precipice if the US doesn&apos;t tend to unfinished business. &quot;The Republicans must finish their commitment to Iraq, especially by signing the security treaty,&quot; she said. &quot;McCain is going to win,&quot; she continued. &quot;I read that the other man nominated is going to pull out the troops. We wish, we need and we hope that this won&apos;t happen.&quot; Most Iraqis seem more concerned about the short term. The time, they say, is not even nearly ripe for the Americans to leave and - for now - they&apos;d rather the devil they know. Twenty kilometres north of Baghdad, the Tarmeya and Qadr district was until earlier this year the most active spot in the most dangerous area of Iraq. But the worm has turned. Tarmeyah is no longer an al-Qaida safe haven and McCain is seen as the best bet to keep it that way.  &quot;If they go now, we may as well all leave too,&quot; said Bassam Jassam, from the region&apos;s dominant tribe, the Mashadani. &quot;McCain is best for us now. But we need to get through the next two years and after that all the Americans can leave.&quot; &quot;The thing we need is stability and strength,&quot; said Edan. &quot;If that goes, and it could, all of this could go again. There is so much at stake for us.&quot;Martin Chulov Beijing: &apos;America is going down while China is rising up&apos; Rao Jin has a soft spot for Barack Obama; he&apos;s drawn to his friendly face as well as admiring his personal achievements. But the hero of young Chinese nationalists stops well short of an endorsement. &quot;I hope the next president can really change the way the US deals with things, always using weapons or economic sanctions,&quot; says the 24-year-old founder of anti-CNN.com. &quot;The election has been a hot topic on our site. [But] one individual can&apos;t change much. Both Obama and McCain are standing for certain interest groups, and both of them will serve for America&apos;s benefit.&quot; Rao&apos;s website became a rallying point for fenqing (&quot;angry youth&quot;) after the international storm over Tibet this year. He says it is not nationalist; merely a counterweight to western media bias and hegemony. For many in China, the US epitomises Occidental aggression and hypocrisy: preaching free trade but practising protectionism; idealising democracy while allowing vast donations; using human rights to justify invading Iraq. Some hope that Obama&apos;s mixed parentage and peripatetic childhood have made him more sympathetic to other cultures. He&apos;s popular among the young and there&apos;s fascination at the prospect of a black president - and what that would say about US tolerance of differences. But younger people are not counting on America to change itself. Many see the end of its global dominance as inevitable, given China&apos;s growing economic and international power. &quot;America is going down, while China is rising up,&quot; said Rao. Hu Ben, erstwhile Chinese subtitler for The West Wing and international editor for a major portal, added: &quot;A lot of young people still think America is our enemy. They&apos;re quite happy with the sub-prime crisis - they think this is China&apos;s chance.&quot; Officials and analysts also seem relaxed about the election result. The &quot;China card&quot; has been waved less often in this race than previous campaigns. They sense an emerging, broadly optimistic bipartisan consensus on Sino-US relations. John McCain appears more hawkish on security issues and relations with Taiwan, but Obama seems tougher on trade, Tibet, human rights and environmental protection. &quot;There will be differences on detailed issues, but the big picture won&apos;t change whoever wins,&quot; predicted Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at Renmin University.Tania Branigan Moscow: &apos;We don&apos;t beg from the west any more&apos; With its padded vinyl seats, chrome fittings and Wurlitzer jukebox, the famous Starlite Diner is a little corner of small-town America right in the heart of Moscow. When it opened in 1994, Russia was reeling in post-Soviet turmoil and was trying to court the west for much-needed investment. &quot;That&apos;s all changed now,&quot; said Sergei Demidov, 35, a banker, tucking into a plate of tenderloin steak and fries. &quot;We don&apos;t beg from the west any more and Washington can&apos;t order us around like it did in the 1990s.&quot; Relations between the US and a resurgent Russia hit a post-cold war low this summer after a fierce proxy conflict in former Soviet Georgia. Most Russians see the US as an aggressive bully that wants to encircle and weaken their country - regardless of whether a Democrat or a Republican is in charge. Barack Obama, however, is widely perceived as the lesser of two evils. A survey in October by Moscow&apos;s Levada Centre polling agency showed that 35% of Russians supported Obama, with 14% for John McCain and 37% confessing no sympathy for either. &quot;Obama would be better,&quot; said Maria Balandina, 26, an arts events manager. &quot;He&apos;s a democrat, he was against the war in Iraq, he&apos;s young.&quot; Former Vietnam pilot McCain, on the other hand, has called for Russia to be ousted from the G8 for allegedly backsliding on democracy and famously claimed he saw only the letters K-G-B in the eyes of Vladimir Putin (unlike George Bush, who thought he glimpsed the Russian leader&apos;s soul). However, observers say Obama&apos;s messianic zeal for reform inside America may not transform into a clear foreign policy. McCain, while a tough talker, might be more convenient for Kremlin hardliners who identify with his blunt rhetoric. &quot;Obama represents a new challenge for Moscow,&quot; said Andrei Kortunov, an analyst from the New Eurasia foundation. &quot;I&apos;m just not sure Russia is ready for that challenge quite yet.&quot; Tom Parfitt Tehran: &apos;I&apos;m not optimistic it will make much difference&apos; Rhythmic chants of &quot;Marg bar Amrika&quot; - &quot;death to America&quot; - boomed from loudspeakers in the streets as the crowd warmed up for Friday prayers, in an event unchanged since the 1979 revolution. Ayatollah Mohammad Emami-Kashani, frail but imposing in the white turban and brown robes of a senior cleric, lambasted &quot;global arrogance&quot;. That is shorthand for the US, but he spells it out anyway. &quot;The claims the US makes against Iran are wrong. The world is waking up to its lies.&quot; Weekly prayers combine politics and religion, agitprop with faith. Mullahs, militiamen and civilians, including schoolchildren, are bussed in to sit on the mosque&apos;s pale green carpets. Women in black chadors are kept separate behind a screen. Kashani does not mention Barack Obama, though there is plenty of discussion of whether victory for him will do anything to improve relations between these old enemies. Iran&apos;s nuclear ambitions - which it insists are peaceful - and its role and influence in Iraq, Lebanon and Palestine, have kept it locked in confrontation with the US since George Bush included the Islamic republic in his &quot;axis of evil&quot; address in 2002. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, seemed to be signalling no change ahead last week when he called Iran&apos;s dispute with America &quot;deep-seated&quot;.  Still, Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former president, has spoken of &quot;new possibilities&quot; if Obama wins. Parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani found the Illinois senator &quot;more rational&quot; than John McCain. By coincidence, the word obama is close to the Farsi for &quot;with us,&quot; though few believe a Democratic victory will be enough to draw the sting from this relationship. Some think all the change must come from the US side - an unlikely prospect. &quot;I&apos;m not optimistic it will make much difference to Iran,&quot; Mohsen Rezaei, ex-commander of the Revolutionary Guards, told the Guardian. Others hope it will. &quot;The countries that have good relations with the US see the benefits,&quot; said Mehdi, a young consultant, walking past Tehran&apos;s &quot;nest of spies&quot; - the old US embassy, still festooned in angry slogans. &quot;We should consider that.&quot;Ian Black Lahore: &apos;McCain understands the Pakistan reality better&apos; The liberal elite at Pakistan&apos;s most prestigious university, which offers American-style business education, look like their peers anywhere around the world. Except here many are backing John McCain. The students at the Lahore University of Management Sciences are not drawn to McCain as a person, saying that Barack Obama is far more appealing, but many believe McCain will be better for Pakistan, a view that is widely held across the country. It all goes back to Obama&apos;s statement that he would order unilateral and immediate strikes against Osama bin Laden in Pakistan if intelligence pointed to him being present in the country. &quot;Obama has stated, so clearly, that &apos;I&apos;m going to attack Pakistan&apos;,&quot; said economics student Motahar Saleheen, between classes at the sprawling LUMS campus. &quot;One nation should not be allowed to interfere with the sovereignty of another.&quot; In Pakistan, Obama&apos;s remarks have been distilled down to a commitment to &quot;bomb Pakistan&quot;, causing fury in a country fearful of becoming the next theatre of war in Washington&apos;s anti-terror fight. &quot;Tomorrow, if Obama attacks Pakistan, we will all rise up to defend ourselves, and the western media will brand us all terrorists,&quot; said fellow student Shahzad Mehboob. Even before Obama&apos;s position on Pakistan was known, there has long been a belief in the county that Republicans are more Pakistan-friendly than Democrats, rooted in the massive financial and military aid provided by he Eisenhower, Reagan and Bush presidencies to Islamabad. Pakistan has been a key ally of the Bush administration, which heavily backed the military-led regime of former president Pervez Musharraf, so the change in US president could have a profound impact on the country. &quot;John McCain understands the Pakistan reality better,&quot; said politics undergraduate Osama Khawar. &quot;But as a human being Obama is a better candidate. It&apos;s a dilemma for us.&quot;Saeed Shah Nairobi: &apos;Whether you&apos;re black or white, vote for Barack&apos; For reggae fans there is Makadem, for rock, Extra Golden. Folk lovers have Kenge Kenge while Tony Nyadundo offers a more traditional sound. All have recently released songs in Kenya with a common word in the title - Obama - and a similar message. &quot;If you&apos;re voting for real change, Barack Obama be the right man, whether you&apos;re black or white, young or old, vote for Barack, Barack Obama,&quot; sings Makadem, who launched the video for &quot;Obama be thy name&quot; at Nairobi&apos;s National Theatre last week. Obama-mania in Kenya is no surprise. The Democratic candidate&apos;s late father was Kenyan, and many of his relatives, including his 87-year-old step-grandmother Mama Sarah, still live here. Neither is it a recent phenomenon; during his Obama&apos;s trip to Kenya in 2006, thousands turned out to see him. But the presidential campaign has lifted the excitement to a new level. Obama&apos;s face now appears on many of the ubiquitous Matatu minibus taxis, thousands of bumper stickers bear his name. Locally printed campaign T-shirts are selling fast; one features the slogan &quot;Ndio Tunaweza&quot; - Swahili for &quot;Yes we can&quot;. A musical based on Obama&apos;s memoir is set to open. Underlying the enthusiasm, is aspiration: many people still believe strongly in the American dream; Kenya has more students studying in the US than any other African country. And Obama, whose father travelled to Hawaii on a scholarship, is the ultimate embodiment of that immigrant dream. Policy-wise, a more nuanced US approach to terrorism issues, especially in places like Somalia, might be expected. But the biggest change may be intangible. One Kenyan columnist wrote this week an Obama win would unleash a &quot;momentum of enlightenment&quot; proving that talent and character rather than ethnicity and power should determine success.Xan Rice Gaza: &apos;Without pressure on Israel there&apos;s no solution&apos; Only a few years ago the bright yellow and orange al-Awda Factory for Biscuits and Ice Cream was a vibrant business and one of the largest factories in the Palestinian territories. Today, like most private firms in the Gaza Strip, it is in dire trouble. Only one of four production lines is working. There are barely two-dozen staff producing packets of hazelnut-flavoured wafers. There is not enough ink to print a sell-by date, not enough cardboard boxes to hold the packets, not enough plastic to wrap the boxes. When the wafers are delivered, they arrive at stores in old fruit cartons. Sales are down to 25% of what they were eight years ago. And this is a good day - for the previous week all production lines were shut down for want of ingredients, packaging and spare parts. The factors that have brought the biscuit factory to such a parlous state will be one of many unenviable Middle East challenges awaiting the new president. Since the Islamist movement Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year, Israel has gradually increased the pressure on what it calls the &quot;hostile entity&quot;. It has severely limited imports and prohibited all exports. Few of Gaza&apos;s 1.5 million people can ever leave. Despite this, Hamas grows steadily stronger, not weaker. Like many Gazans, Mohammed Telbani, the factory&apos;s general manager, says he has little interest in the election. &quot;Presidents have changed but no one did anything for us,&quot; he said, waving his hand dismissively. He doubts that a new president will have the power or the will to reverse decades of US policy in the Middle East which he, like most here, sees as decisively pro-Israeli. &quot;Without pressure on Israel there won&apos;t be any solution to the problem,&quot; he said. If they had to choose, most Palestinians, like most other Arabs, would probably side with Obama (and, conversely, opinion polls show more Israelis would side with McCain). Gazans talk urgently about the need to lift the economic blockade of the strip, to allow the crossings to open and the economy to restart. Palestinians as a whole simply want Washington to play a much tougher role as a Middle East peace broker, bringing concrete change and eventually that much-promised independent Palestinian state.Rory McCarthy \u00b7 This article was amended on Monday November 3 2008.

Most people I know like Barack Obama and if they could vote, they would vote for him. They believe he signals the coming of a changing era, if he keeps his promises.  In the past two decades, under Bill Clinton and George Bush, we have twice witnessed a dramatic change in the US-China relationship after a new president was sworn in. The first two years of each administration were the most uncertain time, when the two countries disagreed on everything from trade, human rights, copyrights and Taiwan to Tibet. However, the bilateral relationship gradually improved. By their second terms, both Clinton and Bush had established a solid mutual understanding with Chinese authorities, though the two countries still pointed fingers at each other from time to time.  It won&apos;t surprise me if a similar scenario happens to Obama. The first thing Obama is likely to raise with his Chinese counterpart is probably the trade imbalance and so-called manipulation of the renminbi exchange rate. To protect American jobs as he has promised, Obama would urge China to export less and buy more from the States. However, at a time of global financial crisis, cheap exports from China have actually helped American people to spend less. What Obama should do is to spend more money to create more jobs for his people, rather than limit American consumers&apos; choices.  Neither Obama and McCain talked much about the Sino-US relationship in their speeches. The fact that China is no longer a dominant issue on the presidential debates indicates that the relationship has entered a stable phase. Both countries are engines for the global economy. But America needs to stop printing unlimited greenbacks and persuade its people to accept a more humble lifestyle. In the meantime, China should also climb the industrial food chain and produce higher quality products.  &quot;They&apos;re neither our enemy nor our friend. They&apos;re competitors,&quot; said Obama of China in the first Democratic primary presidential.debate. I do not agree. In which areas do the US and China compete? No country, including China, will be able to replace the US as the global leader in the foreseeable future. I prefer &quot;stakeholder&quot;, the term used by former deputy secretary of state Robert Zoellick when he described the relationship with China.  When it comes to combating terrorism and negotiating peace on the Korean peninsula, better cooperation and mutual understanding between the US and China suits both countries&apos; interests. If the US wants to sustain its position as top dog, Obama has to do more to cut carbon emissions and join international efforts to fight climate change. This will not only encourage but also put pressure on China to increase its efforts to protect the environment.  In terms of politics and human rights, I believe the US should continue to encourage China to improve human rights and develop a more democratic society. Recent years have seen the decline of America&apos;s moral standing in the world. Chinese people will now be able to look up again to a country whose people chose change, and transformed their country by democratic means."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/nov/12/fake-grades-students-china", "publicationDate": "2008-11-12T10:15:00Z", "tags": ["Newcastle University", "China", "UK news", "Higher education", "International students", "Students", "Education", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Newcastle University has excluded 49 students from China and one from Taiwan after their documents were found to be fake."], "title": "Newcastle expels overseas students with fake grades", "article": "Universities were warned to be vigilant against fraudulent applications today as it emerged one leading institution was forced to kick out 50 overseas students after an investigation. Newcastle University has excluded 49 students from China and one from Taiwan after their documents were found to be fake. The university is now urging others to watch out for high-quality forged certificates that it believes may be circulating widely. University officials became suspicious when some of the students, who started undergraduate and postgraduate courses last month, failed English language assessments, compulsory for arriving students who do not speak English as their first language. An investigation concluded that the students, who had all arrived within the last few weeks to start their studies, had documents relating to their applications and entry qualifications that were either forged or altered to state higher grades than were actually achieved. The university said it regretted having to exclude the students because many of them appeared to be victims of bogus &quot;agents&quot;, based either in China or the UK, who were paid to submit applications, including supporting documents, on their behalf. A spokesman said: &quot;The students were insufficiently qualified to meet the rigorous standards of the university&apos;s academic programmes and it was necessary to exclude them to protect the interests of hundreds of properly qualified students as well as the reputation of the university. &quot;The forgeries, mainly certificates for English language qualifications or degrees awarded by other universities, are of such high quality that they could not have been detected by the usual checks carried out by admissions officers.&quot; The university has informed the Home Office and the police of the results of its investigations and said it believed other academic institutions could be affected. &quot;We would strongly advise other universities to look very carefully at the systems they have in place to detect fraudulent applications and to strengthen them if necessary,&quot; it added. Of the excluded students, 33 are postgraduates and 17 undergraduates. All the students excluded were admitted at the start of the current academic year, in September 2008, with the majority enrolled for programmes at university&apos;s business school. They were excluded after being invited to individual interviews and have been notified of the university&apos;s decision. They have the right of appeal within 14 days. The university said it would not withhold students&apos; full fees and is introducing a number of changes to its admissions procedures, one of which will be to draw up and publish on its website a list of approved agents. &quot;The vast majority of applications for study at this university are genuine,&quot; it said. &quot;We are, however, aware that there is an increasing national and international problem of fraudulent applications and this prompted us, as a university, to take action.&quot; The use of agents is common among students from several countries, including China. While the university said most agents are reputable, it believed that the activities of &quot;bogus&quot; agents have recently become a serious problem. Critics have claimed that overseas students are allowed to graduate from UK universities with poor English language skills.

The prosecutor&apos;s office said Chen could be held indefinitely before charges are filed, but there was no intention to delay. The first three charges carry minimum prison sentences of five years on each count. Members of Chen&apos;s family and former aides are also under investigation. Chen led the country from 2000 until spring this year, when his pro-independence Democratic People&apos;s party suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of the Nationalists.

The success of the Acer Aspire One helped Acer increase its shipments by 64.3% to 4.3 million units, giving it 25% of the market. Asus&apos;s shipments jumped 195.5% to 1.1 million units, putting it in fourth place, behind Hewlett-Packard (3.5m units) and Dell (2.0m units). Of course, since netbooks cost around \u00a3150-\u00a3300, the picture would be far less rosy in value terms. Indeed, given the decline in notebook PC prices -- you can now get Windows Vista notebooks for \u00a3250 -- some suppliers may be shipping more for less. Dell held on to the top spot in the UK market, shipping 708,000 units for a 20.6% market share. Acer increased its shipments by 60.9% to 651,000 units (18.9%) to take second place from Hewlett-Packard (18.7%), which saw shipments fall by 8.2%. Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal says in the press release: &quot;The roll-out of mini-notebooks has masked the weakness in the UK PC market. The demand in the professional market slowed down and vendors&apos; margins continued to shrink as average selling prices fell by double digits again.&quot; In France, Acer led the way with 786,000 units shipped for a 27.6% market share.

It was followed by Hewlett-Packard (13.0%), Fujitsu-Siemens (10.1%), Dell (9.4%) and Medion (6.9%), with Asus failing to place. I guess Medion&apos;s 58.8% growth was driven by Aldi sales of netbooks such as the E1210, which looks like a rebadged MSI Wind. Finally:  Gartner predicts that the PC market will weaken going into the fourth quarter and 2009, even with the increase in shipments of mini-notebooks. &quot;It is impossible for the PC market to avoid the negative impact that the macro-economic factors are having on both business and consumer markets,&quot; said Mr Atwal. &quot;We expect organisations to keep their PCs longer and consumers to delay buying additional PCs for the household.

He brings with him plans for a free trade deal between the nations, planned to come into force by 2010.  Beijing has already promised nearly \u00a350m, plus the loan of its finest engineers, to build a 45,000-seat national sports stadium in place of the previous crumbling 1920s version, now demolished. Why does China love Costa Rica so much? Is it the avowedly pacifist constitution? The commitment to ecology and national parks? No \u2013 it all comes down to a decision in mid-2007 when the country ended more than 60 years of diplomatic relations with Taiwan to formally recognise Beijing - becoming the first Central American country to do so. These are the latest muffled salvos in the so-called &quot;dollar diplomacy&quot; war waged globally by China and Taiwan since the latter separated itself from the mainland in 1949 following the Communists&apos; civil war victory. Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Nationalist forces, who fled to the island, insisted they remained the one true government of China, a notion supported by most nations until the early 1970s, when the US and UN recognition of Beijing led a flood of similar defections. Taiwan, then far more dollar-rich than its giant but struggling neighbour, began shoring up its few remaining allies through generous aid packages, focusing particularly on impoverished states in Central America, Oceania and Africa. But as China became richer, it played the same game. These days, if you are a would-be Taiwanese diplomat your travel prospects are limited, encompassing just four African nations, 10 tiny Pacific and Caribbean island states and the Vatican.

Its president, Oscar Arias, was an honoured guest in China last year. Hu&apos;s current visit will see no fewer than 11 cooperation deals signed, aside from the free trade pact. There are, however, some concerns in Costa Rica that a freed trade pact could see the country \u2013 a net exporter to China \u2013 flooded with Chinese goods.

China&apos;s trade with Latin America has risen tenfold to $102bn (\u00a368bn), and it has toppled the US as Chile&apos;s main trading partner since 2000, although the US remains the region&apos;s main economic partner, with $560bn in trade last year. Cuba&apos;s state news agency reported that Hu signed almost a dozen agreements with Cuba, including plans to upgrade infrastructure and buy sugar and nickel. China hopes to sign a free trade deal this week with Peru to obtain better access to its copper and iron deposits. There is already a $2.2bn deal to extract 7m tonnes of copper from a single Peruvian peak. In Brazil, the Chinese are negotiating to build a $3bn steel mill with help from the Bank of China, which is to open a branch there next year. China has also sunk billions into oil exploration in Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.  China has wooed several Latin America states away from its rival, Taiwan. As a reward, Costa Rica is to receive a $300m soft loan, help with building a 30,000-seat stadium and modernising an oil refinery. In a symbolic step, China last month invested $350m in the Inter-American Development Bank, a signal that it wants to be a long-term player in the region.  As China&apos;s clout grows, that of the US dwindles. The economic slowdown is expected to hit Latin American exports to the US, as well as remittances from Latino migrants. &quot;The reality is that to some degree the fate of Latin America has been decoupled from the US,&quot; Daniel Erickson, of the Inter-American Dialogue thinktank, told the Associated Press. &quot;Or at least it&apos;s not as tightly entwined as it used to be.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/19/piracy-somalia", "publicationDate": "2008-11-19T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Piracy at sea", "Somalia", "World news", "Water transport", "Africa"], "sentences": ["Another sum is less frequently mentioned: the estimated $300m of fish poached in Somali waters annually by trawlers hailing from nations as far away as Taiwan - or France and Spain, for that matter."], "title": "Peter Lehr: A western armada is not the way to sink Somalia's pirates", "article": "The seizure of the Saudi supertanker this week by the pirates of Somalia was their most audacious attack to date, but it was not their first. The pirates hit the headlines a little over three years ago, on November 5 2005, when they attempted to hijack the cruise liner Seabourn Spirit some 75 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia. This brazen but unsuccessful attack triggered the first wave of reports on piracy in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of this beleaguered nation, which has not seen a central and effective government since the downfall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991.  Soon, of course, the problem dropped off the media radar. It came back with a vengeance in April this year with the hijacking of the French luxury yacht Le Ponant. Its 30 crew members were kept hostage for eight days, and released apparently after a substantial amount of ransom had been paid. This time, media attention did not quickly die down: buoyed, no doubt, by the huge ransom paid in the Le Ponant case, Somali pirates embarked on an ambitious campaign, striking ever farther from their own shores. Late in September, Somali pirates succeeded in capturing the MV Faina, which was transporting 33 battle tanks, some 250 nautical miles off the coast of Somalia. The Faina&apos;s crew of 21 is still held hostage - except for its master, who died of a stroke soon after the hijacking. It has been quite a year for Somali pirates: 92 attacks have to date been attempted, with 36 successful hijackings and 268 crew members taken hostage. Given that the average ransom per vessel amounts to about $2m, it is hardly surprising that the port of Eyl, one of the major pirate lairs, has witnessed a veritable boom, with pirates feted by many as local heroes. Some observers estimate that Somali pirates reaped $30m in ransom during the first nine months of this year.  Another sum is less frequently mentioned: the estimated $300m of fish poached in Somali waters annually by trawlers hailing from nations as far away as Taiwan - or France and Spain, for that matter. Seen from this perspective, it is hardly surprising that some pirate groups see themselves as defenders of Somali fishermen, giving their groups names such as National Volunteer Coast Guard of Somalia, or Somali Marines.  Their modus operandi is telling, too. The pirates have reached a technical and nautical sophistication matching that of many &quot;real&quot; coastguards all over the world: Somali pirates operate from mother ships, probably small freighters or local dhows, which enable them to strike so far out at sea. They use satellite phones and GPS as navigational aids, and once they spot their prey they attack it in wolfpack-style, swarming the targeted vessel with fast fibreglass boats and halting its passage by firing AK-47 salvoes or even rocket-propelled grenade rounds. Then they board the vessel, and the maritime hostage scenario begins. So steeply has the situation in the Gulf of Aden and along the 2,000-mile coast of Somalia deteriorated that the EU has initiated a &quot;close support protection system&quot; for vessels transiting these perilous waters. The limitations of that system, and the scale of the challenge for anyone attempting to chase the pirates from the water, was made plain on Monday with the seizure of the Sirius Star outside the EU safe corridor. In any case, deploying western naval squadrons on a continuous basis might not be the best solution. Rather, regional navies or coastguards should be encouraged to pool their resources in order to conduct anti-piracy patrols, modelled on the Malacca Strait Patrol - which conducted by the navies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, resulted in a noticeable decrease of piracy in this former hot spot. This was not lost on Egypt, which recently called upon the Red Sea states to inaugurate a similar combined effort in the Gulf of Aden. The east African coastal waters of Somalia should ideally be patrolled by the naval forces of Kenya, Tanzania and other interested littoral states. The role of western navies could be to lend technical assistance and expertise, as well as provide some secondhand patrol vessels if required. This will be costly, but cheaper than keeping up a substantial western naval presence for the foreseeable future, overstretching military resources further still. However, it should be pointed out that conducting anti-piracy patrols in these waters can only ever be half of the solution. The other is to protect Somali waters against illegal fishing, thus giving local fishermen a fair chance to earn a living without turning to criminality. With all the focus on piracy and the &quot;lure of easy money&quot;, it is all but forgotten that the majority of Somali fishermen do just that - try to earn a decent living against all odds, and now more and more often in the crossfire of pirates and navies. A deadly catch indeed. \u2022 Dr Peter Lehr is a lecturer in terrorism studies at the University of St Andrews and editor of Violence at Sea: Piracy in the Age of Global Terrorism pl17@st-andrews.ac.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/20/china-g8-trade-garton-ash", "publicationDate": "2008-11-20T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Global economy", "China", "US news", "G8", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Just as mainland China, Hong Kong and even Taiwan are in a complex and sometimes indirect conversation about how you do this in a Chinese society, so it would be entirely meaningful for Chinese policymakers to sit down with the leaders of India or Brazil and say: so how do you handle this issue there?"], "title": "Timothy Garton Ash: Here, you can feel the power shift.

The paper&apos;s source is Australia&apos;s Centre of Excellence for Kangaroo Genomics, so it must be true. Whatever next. Pandas originating in France? Kiwis from Costa Rica? The time is out of joint. The skies are full of portents. Yesterday&apos;s financial titans are reduced to dust, while General Motors has become a beggar at the door of government. The world is being reshaped before our eyes, and here in Hong Kong some of the world&apos;s sharpest traders quietly mark the shifts. Seen from this unique meeting point of east and west, a first and obvious shift is from west to east. More specifically: the strengthening of China&apos;s hand and the weakening of America&apos;s. As one navigates around Hong Kong&apos;s archipelago of skyscrapers, connected by overhead walkways, one now looks with some concern at the AIG Tower and perhaps with a little more respect at the dark-glass cutting edge of IM Pei&apos;s Bank of China tower - although Norman Foster&apos;s HSBC still seems to be holding up well. On television, one flicks between the all-American footballer turned treasury secretary Hank Paulson uncharacteristically losing his cool before a congressional committee, as his bail-out seems to need bailing out, and Hu Jintao advancing serenely with a 600-strong delegation to the Asia-Pacific summit in Peru, where the Chinese president will sign a bilateral trade deal that could see China overtake the US as Peru&apos;s leading trading partner. Interviewed on a regional channel, the Indian finance minister notes with satisfaction that the Washington financial summit was of the G20, not just of the G8. That&apos;s how it should be, he says, and how it should remain. The Chinese leadership&apos;s rictus of developmental modesty (&quot;A superpower? What, us?&quot;) slips for a moment as Jin Liqun, who chairs the supervisory board of China&apos;s sovereign wealth fund, says developed countries should seek help from developing countries such as China &quot;with humility&quot;. Referring to the request for an additional capital injection into the IMF, he comments: &quot;Nobody is going to play with you if you want China to spend money amid the deepening financial crisis while still giving us little voting power.&quot; Will an ideological shift accompany the power shift? It&apos;s obviously true that American-style free market economics are under something of a cloud, even in such a hothouse of free market trading as Hong Kong - while the mainland Chinese mix of a more statist market economy, with huge accumulated reserves to draw on in such a crisis, looks rather brighter. I&apos;m told some Chinese Hongkongers do read it that way, even with a tinge of national pride. But they are also far too familiar with all the weaknesses of the Chinese system, as experienced by their mainland relatives and friends - the inequality, the corruption, the insecurity and, yes, the inefficiency - to fall for any simplistic notion of a shining Chinese model. In fact, the story I&apos;m told here is a much more interesting and subtle one. It&apos;s the story of a great, pragmatic debate across the whole of China, one in which Hong Kong Chinese intellectuals and civil society activists can and do participate. How does a Chinese society combine the efficiency of a market economy, tapping a native entrepreneurial spirit comparable to America&apos;s, with some degree of equity, social cohesion or even &quot;harmony&quot;? Behind those big, round words is an often desperate and unstable social reality that has citizens of the People&apos;s Republic frequently going on the streets to protest - the Ministry of Public Security recorded some 74,000 &quot;mass incidents&quot; in 2004 - and even, as happened this week in Gansu province, to battle riot police and trash government buildings. How do you make this thing work? All suggestions welcome. Well, almost all. To be sure, the ideological framing remains significant. President Hu is not going to pursue something he calls &quot;democratic capitalism&quot;, and soon to be ex-president George Bush will not embrace &quot;socialism with American characteristics&quot;. But underneath the big labels, the realities are often surprising. For example, most people would think of the United States as the land of small government and China as a land of big government. But the Hong Kong Chinese scholar Wang Shaoguang estimates that in China today central and local government together still only redistribute some 20% of GDP. In the US, the figure is much higher; how high depends on which federal state you live in, but government certainly redistributes more in blue America than it does in red China. What really matters is what works. Some people here extend this complex pragmatism even to the political system. It&apos;s not just democracy or no democracy, they say, white or black. There are many shades of democracy. The intriguing suggestion is made that the system Hong Kong uses to &quot;elect&quot; its chief executive - which combines an election committee composed mainly of nominated representatives of so-called functional constituencies (different sectors of the economy, religious groups, even 20 members representing Chinese medicine) with the ultimate say-so of the authorities - is one model the Chinese leadership is looking at, as it considers how to extend what it calls democracy in its own system. If true, that&apos;s fascinating, and would be progress. But the impression of the American presidential election is still too fresh in my mind to buy the claim that this is all democracy. Yes, there are many variations between outright tyranny and liberal democracy, but somewhere along the way there is a bright line; and it&apos;s not that difficult to find. Here&apos;s the test: if you don&apos;t know who&apos;s going to win the election, you&apos;re probably in a democracy. We weren&apos;t sure Obama was going to win - remember? Who will succeed Hu is not a choice the Chinese people will make. The line is clear, and fundamental. When it comes to the socio-economic system, however - to the complex negotiations between growth, social cohesion and environmental sustainability, or between the roles of the public and private sector - then I do believe that, within the universe of market economies, there is no longer any simple clear line, no black and white. Just as mainland China, Hong Kong and even Taiwan are in a complex and sometimes indirect conversation about how you do this in a Chinese society, so it would be entirely meaningful for Chinese policymakers to sit down with the leaders of India or Brazil and say: so how do you handle this issue there? This is how we&apos;re trying to do it here. Rudyard Kipling, the poet of British empire who naturally visited Hong Kong, wrote a famous poem called The Ballad of East and West: &quot;Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet ...&quot; No longer true, if it ever was. They meet and mingle all the time. The poem goes on: &quot;... there is neither East nor West ... When two strong men stand face to face ...&quot; These days, it&apos;s more a matter of: there is neither East nor West when weak governments try to meet the demands of restless peoples, on an overheating planet. timothygartonash.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/nov/20/newcastle-university-malaysia", "publicationDate": "2008-11-20T10:12:18Z", "tags": ["Newcastle University", "International students", "Higher education", "UK news"], "sentences": ["High-tech firms from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have already set up in the region."], "title": "Newcastle University builds Malaysian campus", "article": "Newcastle University today started building a campus in Malaysia where its degrees will cost two-thirds of their UK price.

It will start by offering degrees in medicine, but hopes to extend to biotechnology, and to include masters and research programmes. Its medical students are likely to pay an estimated \u00a370,000 for their five-year Newcastle University degree.  They would pay roughly \u00a3102,000 if they were enrolled on the course as overseas students in Tyneside. The campus will be part of EduCity, a hub in the Iskandar region in Johor province that will house up to 100,000 students. Universities and schools from across the world have Asian bases there.  EduCity, only a few kilometres from Singapore, is fast attracting international investors.  High-tech firms from Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have already set up in the region.  Hull University is exploring running undergraduate and postgraduate courses in logistics, engineering, computing and health technologies there. Marlborough college in Wiltshire and Oundle school in Peterborough are considering having satellite schools there.

Until now only the richest students from Malaysia have been able to pay international fees and live in Newcastle. &quot;We are trying to take UK higher education to the customer,&quot; Jordan said. But some might question whether the timing is right. The weak pound has meant that this week UK universities were 22% cheaper than they were a year ago for Malaysian students, according to i-graduate, a higher education research group. Jordan said currency fluctuations were short-term and that the campus would be trading in the Malaysian currency, the ringgit. Will Archer, director of i-graduate, said the timing was perfect for Newcastle. &quot;In times of uncertainty, reputation becomes more important than ever,&quot; he said. &quot;The strong reputation of the UK and Newcastle brands, and the lower cost of study in Malaysia, should make a great combination.&quot; Other universities have announced plans to expand abroad this week.

It notes that China now has both the intent and capability to launch cyber attacks &quot;anywhere in the world at any time&quot;. The conclusions reached in this year&apos;s US-China Economic and Security Review are far more dramatic than before. In 2007, it says, about 5m computers in the US were the targets of 43,880 incidents of malicious activity \u2014 a rise of almost a third on the previous year. China&apos;s ability to wage cyber warfare is now &quot;so sophisticated that the US may be unable to counteract or even detect the efforts&quot;, the report warns.Given the dependence on the internet of key sectors of US public life, from the federal government and military to water treatment, social security and the electricity grid, &quot;a successful attack on these internet-connected networks could paralyse the US&quot;. The review&apos;s six Democrat and six Republican commissioners travelled to China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, and heard testimony from US intelligence agencies for their 393-page report. There has been concern about Chinese computer espionage since 2002, when a large-scale series of cyber intrusions was launched on US military and government computer systems. In that attack, codenamed Titan Rain by the US, the Chinese downloaded up to 20 terabytes of data \u2014 twice the amount stored in the entire print collection of the Library of Congress. Much of the activity is likely to emanate from groups of hackers, but the lines between private espionage and government-sponsored operations are blurred. Some 250 hacker groups are tolerated, and may even be encouraged, by Beijing to invade computer networks. Individual hackers are also being trained in cyber operations at Chinese military bases. &quot;China is stealing vast amounts of sensitive information from US computer networks, said Larry Wortzel, the commission&apos;s chairman. According to the report, Beijing is investing huge resources in cyber and space missions because it sees America&apos;s computer networks and space assets as its &quot;soft ribs and strategic weaknesses&quot;. The extent of its activities gives it the potential to beat the US in military conflict. Technologically, China has improved its range of satellites, so it can now accurately locate US aircraft carrier battle groups quickly, and from a great distance. Such information could be used to guide Chinese missiles to their targets. The Chinese government has given no response to the accusations, but in the past has complained of cyber attacks coming in the opposite direction. In addition to cyber warfare, the panel warns that Beijing is taking an increasingly aggressive stance in its rapidly developing space programme. The panel believes China has concluded that space will in future be an essential arena of warfare. It notes that China tested an anti-satellite weapon last year, giving it the ability to destroy US satellites, in addition to its existing capability to &quot;blind&quot; them by using lasers. So far this year, 15 rockets and 17 satellites have been put into space. China became the third country to explore space in 2003, after the Soviet Union and the US. Until 2002 Beijing opposed the militarisation of space, but it has quietly dropped its opposition since. China&apos;s growing military power, running parallel to its increasing economic might, is likely to present challenges to the incoming administration of Barack Obama. The president-elect has said that &quot;China is rising and it&apos;s not going away&quot;, although he prefers to characterise the US-Chinese relationship as one between &quot;competitors&quot; rather than enemies."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/nov/22/money-reporter-rupert-jones", "publicationDate": "2008-11-22T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Money"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s government has come out with a great wheeze to stave off a downturn - it is handing everyone around \u00a370 in &quot;free cash&quot; to spend in its shops and restaurants.", "Prime minister Liu Chao-shiuan said the handout of T$3,600 in the form of vouchers to each of Taiwan&apos;s 23 million people would happen in January, according to the BBC News website."], "title": "The Reporter: Rupert Jones takes a sideways look at the news", "article": "You read it here first &quot;The risky way to get it Together&quot; was the headline on a Guardian Money article almost three years ago which told how first-time buyers were snapping up a Northern Rock mortgage that allowed you to borrow as much as 125% of a property&apos;s value.

Thanks to at least two centuries of British and American romanticism - Lord Byron to Johnny Depp - it implies a man (or in two famous instances, a woman) who is not wholly bad and many moral levels professionally above footpads, rapists and serial killers. For instance, is there an epoch known to historians as the Golden Age of Rape? No, but sometimes in books about buccaneers you will find the Golden Age of Piracy, which in British terms lasted from the 1650s till about 1725. In some respects, the pirates of Somalia are behaving in the classic tradition. According to reports, they are spending millions of dollars of ransom money on imported food, alcohol, drugs and prostitutes, just as predecessors debauched and befuddled themselves whenever possible with tobacco, rum and whoring. In other ways, though, their behaviour (so far) matches the romantic ideal rather than the brutal reality.  More than 200 kidnapped sailors are being well looked after on a dozen hijacked ships that have been moored at the fishing port of Eyl; or, in the case of the Sirius Star, their biggest prize, a few hundred miles down the Somali coast at Harardheere. No harm has been done to them. What their captors want are dollars from the ships&apos; owners, not the blood of their crews. With this in mind, a Somali pirate with historical leanings might scoff at the outrage of David Miliband and consider the case of Thomas Avery, whose old exploits in the present Somali hunting ground, the Gulf of Aden, make modern piracy look like peacetime manoeuvres by a marine branch of the Fabian Society. According to the historian David Cordingly&apos;s account, in his book Life Among the Pirates, Avery was a typical British pirate - &quot;of middle height, rather fat, with a dissolute appearance&quot;. He was born in Plymouth in 1653, served in the Royal Navy, and then seized command (the captain was drunk at the time) of an English privateer - a privately owned ship licensed by the government to attack the state&apos;s enemies. By 1695, he was prowling at the entrance to the Red Sea waiting for the pilgrim fleet that sailed every year from India to Mecca, filled with valuables, because pilgrimage was also an opportunity to trade, and protected by the heavily armed ships of the Great Mogul in Delhi. Avery got lucky. One of his cannonballs dismasted the Great Mogul&apos;s flagship, which was not only carrying piles of gold and silver but also many slave girls and, it was said, one of the Great Mogul&apos;s daughters. What Cordingly calls &quot;an orgy of rape, torture and plunder&quot; lasted days and Avery&apos;s crew got away with the equivalent of \u00a31,000 each. The English government was embarrassed - it needed to preserve the East India Company&apos;s relationship with the Mogul emperor - and eventually caught six of the pirates and had them hanged. Avery himself vanished; rumour suggests he died in poverty in Devon, rather like Ben Gunn at the end of Treasure Island who spent a thousand pounds in 19 days and was &quot;back begging on the twentieth&quot;. Like most pirates, Avery was an amoral opportunist who switched easily among the blurred divisions between privateering, buccaneering and sailing as a navy or merchant seaman (by the end of the 17th century the average age of a pirate was 27 - roughly the same as Somalia&apos;s modern pirates - and almost all had begun their working lives in the Royal Navy or on cargo ships). Still, his legacy was profound: you might even argue that he began the process that enabled the careers of Byron&apos;s Corsair, Long John Silver, Captain Hook and Errol Flynn, and has brought us to the recently announced Pirates of Caribbean, Part IV. A now obscure dramatist, Charles Johnson, took the story of Avery&apos;s barbarous raid in the Gulf of Aden and turned it into a play, The Successful Pyrate, in which all the horrid facts were left behind.  Avery, now King Arviragus of Madagascar, became the first of piracy&apos;s noble outlaws. A captured ship is brought to him. It contains the Mogul&apos;s granddaughter, the fair Zaida. Arviragus falls in love, but Zaida loves another: one of her fellow captives, the young Aranes. Disaster! Revelation! Aranes turns out to be Arviragus&apos;s long lost son. The play opened at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1713, the first in a succession of pirate melodramas that went on being produced well into the 19th century, until Gilbert and Sullivan&apos;s satirical The Pirates of Penzance put an end to them. But where did writers do their research, supposing any were needed? The answer comes from the same period in a book by a Captain Johnson, who in 1724 published A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, which ran to several editions and was translated into French.  Nobody knows who Johnson was: a theory that Daniel Defoe was the author has now been discredited. But his book became the seminal text. Out of it came the public&apos;s first appreciation of Blackbeard and Captain Kidd and the two women pirates, Mary Read and Anne Bonny. Robert Louis Stevenson consulted it, when, in a Highland cottage during the wet and chill summer of 1881, he began to devise an entertainment for his stepson. Nobody in Johnson&apos;s book says &quot;yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum&quot; but there is a vivid description of &quot;a fellow with a terrible pair of whiskers, and a wooden leg, being stuck around with pistols ... swearing and vapouring on the quarter deck&quot;. By the time Stevenson invented John Silver, real pirates were at best a folk memory in the western world. A few might survive in the South China Sea, but efficient navies had destroyed them elsewhere. Motivation had also been reduced. Pirates often fenced their stolen cargoes to smugglers, but free trade had dramatically lowered import duties and smuggling died as an occupation.  The way was open for the pirate as an antihero, the rebel against society, or simply a comic character as in Captain Hook. As Pieter van der Merwe of the National Maritime Museum says: &quot;Blackbeard was a terrible man - a psychopath - but piracy had been effectively wiped out in the 18th century. You forgot the fact that it was a curse.&apos; It became a hobby. Philip Gosse, the son of litterateur and memoirist Edmund Gosse, was a doctor who collected nearly 500 books on piracy and in 1932 published an authoritative history of the subject (his library is now the Gosse collection at the National Maritime). And next it became a study, with historians anxious to revise or enlarge our previously simple ideas. Some pirates were proto-feminists and others gay (Sodomy and the Pirate Tradition, 1983). In The Many-Headed Hydra, Peter Linebaugh and Marcus Rediker define pirate ships as &quot;multinational, multicultural and multiracial&quot; institutions - fine little democracies - that resisted the oppression of the capitalist merchant shipping industry. Pirates were &quot;egalitarian, class-conscious and justice-seeking&quot; and always shared their spoils. Not everyone agrees: black seamen probably had as raw a deal as pirates as they had anywhere else, but perhaps the pirates of Somalia can also be seen in such a kind light; many of them are said to be fishermen who have turned to piracy because big trawlers from developed nations - Spain, Taiwan - are ruthlessly plundering their fishing grounds. But it also seems likely that when it comes to booty they also have more than a little of the Thomas Avery in them - the non-fiction version, with eyes swelling at the sight of dubloons and a voice in the head forever squawking about pieces of eight."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/24/standardchartered-banking", "publicationDate": "2008-11-24T08:47:30Z", "tags": ["Standard Chartered", "Banking", "Business", "UK news"], "sentences": ["Kwok said Standard Chartered&apos;s exposure to Pakistan, South Korea, Taiwan and India made it vulnerable to potential losses from bad debts."], "title": "Standard Chartered seeks \u00a31.8bn to shore up capital", "article": "The UK bank Standard Chartered today announced a \u00a31.8bn rights issue as a cushion against potential losses in Asia and the Middle East.

Will more easy credit get us out of it? Alistair Darling evidently thinks so: a \u00a320bn package of pump-priming, plus tax cuts, to spur spending which, he hopes, will avoid an ugly recession turning into an unnecessary slump. The perennial problem for any chancellor is that any budget measure, bar the most dramatic, meets with a miserable response from &quot;case studies&quot; to explain what it means to you. TVs cheaper by a tenner because VAT is down? &quot;Drop in the ocean, mate. You should see how much I spend at Tesco&apos;s. And he&apos;ll grab it all back in national insurance anyway.&quot; Maybe he should have emulated Taiwan&apos;s chancellor, who last week handed 23 million people a \u00a370 voucher each to spend in shops. Darling&apos;s job is to pull off a huge confidence trick. To convince households that times are tough but not catastrophic. That it still makes sense to buy a home, or a car, or even to start a business. That while unemployment will rise, it&apos;s unlikely to be you. It&apos;s why he began yesterday by telling us his measures would ensure the downturn will be &quot;shallower and shorter&quot;, and Britain is &quot;well placed to benefit from a return to growth&quot;. It didn&apos;t help that in August he told the truth - times are &quot;arguably the worst they&apos;ve been in 60 years&quot;. Darling&apos;s problem is that household budgets are not just stretched, they&apos;ve been stretched for years by rising house prices, food prices, fuel costs and council tax; and the elastic is now moving in the other direction, painfully fast. It was bad when the credit card was maxed out. It&apos;s a lot worse when the credit card is maxed out and you&apos;re worried about your job. It is future income expectations, not next month&apos;s pay check, that determine our spending patterns. It would be rational if in good times we paid off debts and in bad times we borrowed and spent. We don&apos;t. We accumulate debts when confident about our personal finances, and cut back when we are worried. In doing so we all play a personal role in contributing to boom and bust. And hectoring, or tinkering, won&apos;t change that one jot. How many times have you heard friends say: &quot;We won&apos;t be spending so much on Christmas this year.&quot; Such decisions, replicated millions of times, will leave retailers in disarray. And sensible consumers, knowing the pain retailers are in, will wait until January before spending. It&apos;s the same with mortgages. Lucky ones on tracker deals will see cuts in monthly payments - \u00a3100, Darling said yesterday. But will households spend or pay down debt instead? The latter is more likely. After all, households will need to cover national insurance rises now pencilled in for 2011. Only those with no savings at all, whose meagre income or tax credits barely cover their minimum living costs, will carry out their patriotic duty and spend the lot.

Joshua Rosenzweig, research manager for the US-based Dui Hua Foundation, said there was &quot;no justification&quot; for the death penalty in Wo&apos;s case. He said he could not recall another capital case in China that had attracted so much international attention.  The number of executions in China is a state secret, but foreign groups believe several thousand are carried out each year. Even going by reported cases, the country executes more people annually than the rest of the world combined. The supreme court gained the right to overturn capital sentences in 2006 and earlier this year independent analysts suggested the resulting fall in executions could be as great as 30% year-on-year.  Nicholas Bequelin, of Human Rights Watch, warned: &quot;A decrease is not in itself a measure of the success of review. What is a measure of success is whether it stops miscarriages of justice, depoliticises cases and allows the defence to really represent the suspect. &quot;There&apos;s disenchantment with reform of the death penalty...

Arriving from a west exhilarated by the prospect of the Obama presidency, you get a cold shower in the capital of the world&apos;s most important rising power. I&apos;ve met a few young people who rather like him - because he&apos;s young, stands for change and is not your classic white westerner - but the reactions of older heads with knowledge of Chinese foreign policy range from sober, through sceptical, to downright suspicious. In fact, China is one of the few places on earth that may mourn the departure of President George W Bush. While Bush started out in 2001 on a tetchy and rivalrous note with China, since the 9/11 attacks revealed an immediate and vicious enemy the Chinese-US relationship has been put on a more solid footing than ever; far more solid than the still fragmentary Chinese-European one. There may also be a more back-handed reason. Because Bush managed to damage America&apos;s reputation and influence in most other parts of the world, an economically dynamic China has looked good by comparison; or at least, better than it used to. Now that Obama promises to restore the US&apos;s moral authority and soft powers of attraction in the rest of the world, China will have to work harder to keep its post-Olympic shine. Liberal internationalists may protest that this should not be a zero-sum game; but liberal internationalism, of the kind now returning from thinktank exile to the White House, is not the default mode in Beijing. Here, the voices of cautious pragmatists mingle with those of hard-edged realists for whom China&apos;s national interests, economic development and status in the world come first, second and third. Some Chinese policy intellectuals will also dispute that they have anything to fear from, so to speak, renewed ideological competition. After this autumn&apos;s meltdown of American free-market capitalism, let the world compare the Chinese and the US models! But I don&apos;t sense that their confidence goes very deep. What they all agree is that a number of contentious issues might shake the relationship between China and the US - and that with Europe - quite early in the Obama presidency. They mention two Ts: Trade and Tibet. I will add two others: Taiwan and Tiananmen (standing more broadly for human rights issues, especially with the 20th anniversary of the events on Tiananmen square coming up next June). So, four Ts. The most pressing for the US is trade. Since it will take time for the Chinese government&apos;s own $600bn fiscal stimulus package to kick in, and since Chinese consumers&apos; instinctive reaction to a crisis is hardly to spend more, the economy will continue to depend on exports to sustain its growth, even at the lower level now predicted. But as American workers are being laid off, while Obama promised in his campaign to create more jobs, the cries for protectionism in the US are sure to get louder. If these come in the form of demands for higher standards of labour and environmental protection in trade agreements, they can expect a sympathetic hearing from the new president. Those are two things he cares about. And if Hillary Clinton is named secretary of state after the Thanksgiving holiday, Chinese concerns will go up another notch, for on this subject her presidential campaign was tougher than Obama&apos;s. Meanwhile, the matter of Tibet has already returned to haunt Chinese-European relations. Many Chinese (not just officials but also nationalist netizens) are still smarting, to a degree most Europeans probably don&apos;t appreciate, from the pro-Tibet protests around the Olympic torch relay in Paris and London. But many Europeans (internationalist netizens far more than officials) are still smarting, to a degree most Chinese probably don&apos;t appreciate, from what has happened in Tibet. Public opinion is aroused on both sides. In this highly flammable setting, the Chinese government yesterday postponed an EU-China summit due to have been held in France next Monday, with the participation of Chinese premier Wen Jiabao. The main reason is apparently that president Nicolas Sarkozy will meet the Dalai Lama at the end of next week, at Lech Walesa&apos;s celebration of the 25th anniversary of his Nobel peace prize. The Tibetan winner of the Nobel peace prize is also due to address the European parliament and talk to other leaders. It seems incredible and absurd that such an important strategic relationship as that between China and the EU is put into question on this account. After all, the China-US relationship flourishes despite the fact that president Bush has not only met with the Dalai Lama but also personally participated in decorating him with the Congressional Gold Medal. And this unilateral Chinese postponement is most likely to achieve the opposite of the desired effect, cementing a common EU position regarding meeting with the Tibetan leader. So one of these four Ts has already brought on storm clouds before the sun of Obama is even properly in the sky. How can we prevent things getting worse in future? Partly by being prepared for turbulence on these issues, but also by enlarging the context. Seizing the hopeful moment that is the advent of the Obama presidency, we should start work with China on a strategic partnership including four major projects of what I call visionary realism: a reformed and strengthened global economic order, a multilateral and multidimensional approach to development (including trade, aid, good governance, transparency, democracy and the rule of law), energy and the environment (a central plank of the Obama campaign) and, last but not least, reversing nuclear proliferation. Call them the four Ss, if you will, where S stands for strategy. These things are worth doing in themselves, and nowadays the west can only do them with China, not against it. They are also ways of strengthening the overall relationship so it can withstand some T-shocks. When I say &quot;we should start work with China&quot;, I mean exactly that. Not the old west working out a set of common positions and then presenting them to China, but attempting to work with China from the outset to forge common strategic positions. There are some here who say China is not yet able or willing to engage strategically, beyond securing the direct external requirements for its own domestic development. There are some who say Europe is incapable of getting its act together. There are not a few who suspect that even Obama&apos;s America will be preoccupied with a checklist of more urgent concerns. They may all be right. But the task of analytical commentary is not to discount so much for immediate realities that you end up writing the kind of policy brief that a cautious official produces on a bad day. The job of commentary - not the only job, but one of several - is to lift policymakers&apos; eyes above the Urgent in-tray on their desks, towards larger goals that are difficult, but not impossible, to achieve. After yesterday&apos;s slap in the face this may sound like wishful thinking, but sometimes bad turns have positive unintended consequences. It&apos;s just because the risks associated with the four Ts are so apparent that we need to keep working on the four Ss. And I trust that will translate into Chinese characters.www.timothygartonash.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/27/japan", "publicationDate": "2008-11-27T11:16:59Z", "tags": ["Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["It is my job to try and make everyone understand what he really meant.&quot; Previous Aso gems include a joke about Alzheimer&apos;s patients and his desire for Japan to become the kind of country in which &quot;the richest Jews would want to live.&quot; He has also likened Japan&apos;s biggest opposition party to the Nazis, praised Japan&apos;s colonial rule in Taiwan and told US diplomats they would never be trusted in Middle East peace negations because they have &quot;blue eyes and blond hair.&quot;"], "title": "Gaffe-prone Japanese PM offends country's 'doddering' pensioners", "article": "Japan&apos;s outspoken prime minister, Taro Aso, has risked offending the country&apos;s 40m pensioners after he described them as tax burdens who should take better care of their health.

Aso, a loquacious politician with a knack for verbal blunders, vowed to put his gaffe-prone past behind him when he became leader two months ago.

Upsetting the over 65s is a risk for any politician, let alone the leader of a country with the fastest-ageing population on earth. His government, trailing in the opinion polls, must call a general election by next September, one that many expect to be dominated by mounting economic problems, welfare reforms and how to fund the creaking state pension system. Aso has also failed to resolve an administrative foul up, admittedly made under a previous Liberal Democratic party administration, which resulted in the loss of millions of pension premium payments. He later insisted he had not meant to characterise elderly people suffering from illnesses as feckless parasites. &quot;If I hurt the feelings of anyone who is ill, then I am sorry,&quot; he told reporters.

The report warned of the dangers of Chinese nuclear weapons, and called on the United States to revitalise its nuclear deterrent, continue construction of a missile defence shield, and pursue conventional military programmes designed to ensure dominance over China. In alarmist tones, the report describes a military effort dedicated to making the US vulnerable enough to Chinese nuclear attack to deter the US from intervention in a Taiwan-China war. To call this claim deceptive is an understatement \u2013 it depends on ignorance of 40 years of Chinese military history and of the basics of deterrence theory.  Since the 1950s, Chinese nuclear policy has consistently focused on the goal of developing a second strike capability. Initially, the Chinese feared war with the US, but they later included the Soviet Union as a potential foe. The Chinese have never made an effort to match the nuclear arsenals of the US or Russia. In short, Chinese nuclear policy hasn&apos;t changed, and the essentials of the deterrent relationship are the same whether China has 20 missiles capable of striking the west coast or 100 missiles capable of striking anywhere on the continental US. As no American president is likely to consider the destruction of major population centres on the west coast an acceptable cost for preventing a Chinese conquest of Taiwan, the deterrent relationship is no different today than it was 30 years ago.  Indeed, the ISAB report overlooks the central purpose of the Chinese nuclear expansion, which is an effort to restore the nuclear balance that existed in the 70s and 80s. Advanced US military capabilities have, it is generally agreed, substantially eroded the deterrent relationship that existed between the US and its nuclear competitors during the cold war.  Daryl Press and Keir Lieber argued in Foreign Affairs that the US holds first-strike dominance over both China and Russia, in large part because due to stealth and precision-guidance capabilities. The development of a credible missile defence system (one that could knock out a high percentage of incoming missiles) would further erode the deterrent relationship. The Chinese are hardly ignorant of these developments. They recognise that the drive for missile defence on the part of the US means that they need to expand their nuclear capabilities in order to stay in the same place. It ends up being a good trade for the Chinese, because additional ballistic missiles (and eventually MIRVs, or multiple independent re-entry vehicles) are considerably cheaper than the missile defence system. Nevertheless, the expansion of the Chinese nuclear programme is an effort to maintain the status quo, and not to shift the military balance in China&apos;s favour.  We&apos;ve been here before. Wolfowitz participated in the infamous Team B project, which was an effort to radically overstate Soviet capabilities and radically misstate Soviet intentions in the 1970s. Like the Team B project, the ISAB report relies on claims about Chinese capabilities that current intelligence cannot verify, such as the existence of tactical nuclear weapons and a vast espionage network inside the US. Also like the Team B project, the report characterises efforts to maintain the status quo as threatening. The alarmism is familiar. Once again, Wolfowitz is claiming that the strategic balance is beginning to tip against the US, and that therefore the US ought to engage in a major effort at revitalising its own capabilities.  President Bush leaves office in two months, and Wolfowitz will be out of a job. In the neoconservative world, however, no one stays unemployed for long. This ISAB report will serve as a template for the neoconservative approach to China and provide the foundation for critiques of Barack Obama&apos;s China policy. It is highly unlikely that Obama will pursue the &quot;revitalisation&quot; of the US nuclear force, as he has already logged his opposition to the Reliable Replacement Warhead programme. The report should be understood less as an internal effort to drive policy, and more as the opening shot in an effort to criticise Obama as soft on China."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/dec/02/japan-shares-nikkei-asia", "publicationDate": "2008-12-02T08:13:02Z", "tags": ["Market turmoil", "Shares", "Toyota", "Japan", "US economy", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng index lost 4.9% to 13411 and Australia&apos;s key index was down 4.2% at 3528, while indices in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and the Philippines also slumped."], "title": "Asian shares suffer sharp falls", "article": "Shares in Asia suffered sharp falls today, tracking Wall Street lower amid increasingly dismal predictions for the global economy.

The study of maths and science skills of 10 and 14-year olds, conducted across the globe every four years, reveals strong improvements in English pupils&apos; knowledge of algebra and physics, but a dramatic slide in their enjoyment of the subjects.  Ministers yesterday hailed the findings of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) as vindication of Labour&apos;s policies including the key Blairite introduction of the numeracy hour, which the pupils in the study would have had throughout their schooling.  Scottish students - who have not had the same maths strategy - slipped in the study, prompting the Scottish Executive to launch an urgent inquiry into maths and science to address what the minister called &quot;unacceptable failings&quot;. Researchers in 59 countries tested pupils&apos; basic maths and physics skills and asked them questions about their experiences in schools. In England 143 primaries and 136 secondaries were selected with 30 pupils randomly chosen at each by researchers at the National Foundation for Education Research.  At age 14, England went up from 18th to seventh place in the maths ranking, and from seventh to fifth in science. 10-year-olds went from tenth to seventh in maths but fell from fifth to seventh in science. The researchers said that the fall in science was not statistically significant.  Meanwhile, &quot;enjoyment&quot; levels among 14-year-olds have dropped by 25 percentage points in maths and 21 percentage points in science since 1999, the report shows. The study also reveals the lifestyles of pupils who are likely to do better in maths and science lessons: they read for enjoyment at home, relish their homework and often play a musical instrument as well. Those who lag behind go home and watch TV, play on the computer, listen to music and chat to their friends.  Jim Knight, the schools minister, said there was a culture of &quot;scepticism&quot; about science in England and too many people believed it was &quot;funny&quot; to be bad at maths. He said: &quot;They value it more and see the importance of maths in their futures. That in turn is reflected in the fact that they are doing well. They are knuckling down ... getting on with it even though it&apos;s not their first love.&quot; He said he was planning a visit to Hong Kong, which scored at the top of the tables along with Taipei, Korea, Singapore and Japan, to learn from their examples.  Sir Peter Williams, chancellor of Leicester University, who led a government commissioned review of early maths teaching published in June, said he was not surprised by the Asian nations&apos; success. &quot;I have been at homes of Korean friends when their children have come back in from crammers at 10pm to go straight to bed. It&apos;s not a system I would wish to see us copy.&quot; The improvements in England came as a surprise to many as Sats test results have stalled recently and the UK plummeted in other international league tables for literacy and science last year. The Conservatives said England was in a &quot;second league&quot; after Asian countries and pointed out that Kazakhstan rated higher than England in maths results for 10-year-olds.  Alan Smithers, director of education at Buckingham University, said the countries in the TIMSS study were a &quot;mixed bag&quot;. &quot;We are comparing ourselves with Qatar and Tunisia and Finland and the Netherlands aren&apos;t included, so that acts to push-up our schools.&quot;  He added: &quot;As in sport, a lot of the ultimate satisfaction in maths comes from long hours of practice that have to be put in to striving to reach the top of potential. That&apos;s not always fun.&quot; Christine Blower, the acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, welcomed the findings. She added: &quot;The obvious question is whether test and examination hot-housing is actually turning off young people&apos;s enjoyment of those subjects, despite their undoubted attainment.&quot; Top of the table Top 10 countries according to maths skills of 10-year olds 1 Hong Kong 2 Singapore 3 Taiwan 4 Japan 5 Kazakhstan 6 Russian Federation 7 England 8 Latvia 9 Netherlands 10 Lithuania"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/dec/10/education", "publicationDate": "2008-12-10T11:26:24Z", "tags": ["Education policy", "Education", "Politics", "Schools", "Mathematics", "World news", "Kazakhstan", "South and Central Asia"], "sentences": ["They are now around 7th place (5th in science at 14), behind only smaller, hyper-competitive Asian rim countries \u2013 Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, plus Japan \u2013 the Russians and, yes, Kazakhstan."], "title": "School maths: The Borat factor", "article": "Did you notice that Kazakhstan popped up in the newspapers twice today by way of a ranking in international league tables?

According to the Guardian&apos;s Borat-free account of maths and science skills, evaluated in the latest TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study) report, English 11- and 14-year-olds have risen sharply in the global hierarchy.  They are now around 7th place (5th in science at 14), behind only smaller, hyper-competitive Asian rim countries \u2013 Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, plus Japan \u2013 the Russians and, yes, Kazakhstan. Should we celebrate, as Labour ministers will urge us to do? I suppose so; it is always better for morale to be seen doing well than doing badly. But I am always sceptical about international tables of this kind. Are they accurate? How do they affect real outcomes like happiness or Nobel prizes? How good are Kazakh educational stats? How depressed are high-performing Japanese children and young adults? Is it true, as the Times reports today, that Korean kids come home from the crammers at 10 o&apos;clock and go straight to bed? We have our downsides too, of course. We may be seventh in maths and science, but league tables routinely report we are top for binge drinking, teenage pregnancy, drugs and other nasty little habits. I take those figures with a pinch of salt too.  Economists sometimes report that German economic data often has to be revised downwards because statisticians there retain an ingrown habit of believing what they&apos;re told by higher authority. Still, faulty data is usually better than none. The second of today&apos;s Kazakh-laden batch was less flattering. On a separate page the Guardian reported that the children of poor families in Britain \u2013 not just England in this instance \u2013 are far, far more likely to be killed or injured than the children of middle class professionals and above. The figures emerged on a day when an inquest in Herefordshire heard how Angus Davison, a wealthy fruit farmer, accidentally backed his BMW over his 18-month-old daughter, when leaving for work, unaware of what he had done. But the generalisation holds: the poor are more vulnerable. In fact, at 25.4 per 100,000 long-term jobless families, the death rate (which is 1.9 per 100k in the higher socio-economic groups) is close to that of, yes, Kazakhstan, on 26.98.  That is not a strictly fair comparison, of course, because the overall UK rate is four per 100k, so it is four against 26.98 in vast, oil-rich (and thus authoritarian), under-populated (15m) Kazakhstan, the ninth largest country in the world. The UK figure is down from 11 per 100k in 1981 so we must acknowledge that all those risk-obsessed safety measures which have made being a kid less fun do have some practical effect, though you might ask in passing if the long-term effects of premature obesity on health have been factored in.  That&apos;s the trouble with such data; it often rests on questionable assumptions, accidentally or to shore up a policy or a product. As noted here the other day, the Guardian&apos;s Bad Science columnist, Ben Goldacre, is never short of work. Today&apos;s results will not end the perennial debate about the quality of British education, which recently I heard the magnificently non-PC Norman Stone \u2013 former regius professor of history at Oxford, now teaching in Turkey \u2013 suggest has virtually collapsed from its days of grandeur.  Indeed, some critics of the TIMSS study suggest it concentrates too much on mid-range achievement and not enough on stretching the more able. One of my kids, who was good at maths, did not re-encounter what he learned in the fast stream of an American primary school at nine until he was 17 back in Britain. As for child safety and education in tandem, well, the Times reports today that teachers in some of Britain&apos;s 1,600 Muslim madrassas \u2013 which give after-school faith lessons to 200,000 \u2013 kids are &quot;slapped, punched and have their ears twisted&quot;.  Tricky eh? I do not expect schools inspectors to rush in and restore order for what will be called reasons of cultural sensitivity. Maths and science, of course, were once the glory of medieval Islamic civilisation. I hope they teach that \u2013 in between the ear-twisting.

The story says:  Asustek Computer, which had essentially created the market in late 2007, lost significant share as Acer surged to the top spot, capturing more than 35% of this market.  This is a bit of a blow for Asus, but there are obvious reasons, as I told Asus UK on Monday. First, Acer is winning on price, at least outside schools, and that&apos;s partly because it has higher volumes and just one basic model, the Acer Aspire One. Second, Acer is doing very well in the US, where it has dominated the Amazon.com sales charts; Asus is, by contrast, much stronger in Europe than it is in the US.The most surprising thing about the table is that MSI doesn&apos;t come higher. MSI looks strong in Asia (judging by the number of machines you see in the shops), but it has other outlets, including some UK sales under the Advent label, which aren&apos;t counted in the table. The growth of the netbook market has impacted the portable PC market, which includes both notebooks and netbooks. Acer and Asus have increased their market shares, while the companies that arrived late (Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo), or don&apos;t want to compete in the netbook market (Apple, Sony), have lost market share. In the full portable table (below), HP retained its top spot, but Acer overtook Dell to take second place. Asus, with its 189% growth in unit shipments, vaulted over Apple, Sony, Lenovo and Fujitsu-Siemens to draw level with Toshiba, and it will take fourth place this quarter. On a global basis, all the top portable computer companies grew faster than Apple (24% growth), except Lenovo (7%) and Sony (2%). Whether they care is another matter. A table of suppliers by sales revenues would look very different from the one for unit sales. Apple and Sony are competing to sell portable computers that cost $1,000-$2,000, and they&apos;re not playing in the $250-$500 market, where margins are razor thin. Apple makes so much profit on a MacBook Pro, it could afford to give buyers an Asus netbook or Acer Aspire One free.

As they have for many years now, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan took home the medals. The contest was the quadrennial match of brainpower called the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, known fondly as the Timss, a worldwide measure of schoolchildren&apos;s achievements, coordinated by Boston College and the non-profit International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement. In both the Timss and the other gold standard international test, the Pisa - the Programme for International Student Assessment, an OECD test of 15-year-olds&apos; knowledge of maths, reading and science given every three years since 2000 - the same countries seem to win again and again. Why do these rankings matter? Because they can predict the future. The subjects they measure are essential in today&apos;s highly engineered, technologically driven world, where countries and individuals compete for prizes as dear as political self-determination, prosperity and jobs. We live in a knowledge-based economy in which brains trump brawn. Over the next 15 years, the UK alone will add five million highly skilled jobs and lose just as many low-skilled ones. Finding educated talent is already one of the biggest challenges facing government and business, and it grows more important in a turbulent economy which craves not only educated people but also people with adaptable skills. In the final American election debate, Barack Obama said international competitiveness in maths and science &quot;probably has more to do with our economic future than anything&quot;. Gordon Brown put it differently: &quot;A generation ago a British prime minister had to worry about the global arms race. Today a British prime minister has to worry about the global skills race.&quot; The US and England are both attuned to the need for education, and both ranked in the top 15 in this year&apos;s Timss. But in the champions&apos; league were Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan. The same few countries dominate Pisa results, too. Finland was top science performer and second in reading and maths in the latest results, announced last year, while South Korea was first in reading and Taiwan topped the maths table. Study the winners and you&apos;ll see that success isn&apos;t tied to class size, facilities, study time or money. The key is simply the winners&apos; care for and attention to their education system, focused in three important areas. First, individualism. In Finland students start school later and spend fewer hours there than almost anywhere else, but schools emphasise &quot;learning to learn&quot;, not to get a job or a university degree. They focus on personalised, diagnostic assessment that works to &quot;support and guide pupils in a positive manner&quot;, as the Finnish education board phrases it. Students are carefully monitored so that specially trained teachers can catch them the moment they fall behind and intervene quickly to help them catch up. Second, technology. High-scoring countries like South Korea use technology to make connections and to share information. Teachers share ideas online and parents become more involved in their children&apos;s instruction. The South Korean education minister recently said access to technology over the last 10 years has changed how their students relate to teachers, so they question rather than merely absorb. South Korea is obviously doing more than just that right. About 60 years ago, only half the children in the country went to any school at all. Today 97% of 25- to 34-year-olds have completed upper secondary education - the highest rate among OECD countries. And finally, teachers. Probably most important, the best-performing countries tend to set great store by how they select and train teachers, starting a virtuous circle that elevates teaching to a noble and honourable status and attracts the best. &quot;Are You the Right One?&quot; Singapore&apos;s education ministry asks aspiring teachers visiting its website. Only one in five applicants is admitted to teacher education, and of those who train, nine out of 10 become teachers. Applicants are advised that &quot;teaching is not for the short term&quot; and are assessed for communication skills, willingness to learn and &quot;the passion to teach and the belief that you can make a difference&quot;. We&apos;re intently focused right now on how to relieve a severe economic contraction. But perhaps we&apos;re not looking in the right place. Our long-term economic health might revolve as much around the classroom as the boardroom, the trading floor or the halls of parliament. One effective long-term economic stimulus package might be a massive teacher recruitment, development and reward programme. That would repay the taxpayer - and all taxpayers of the future - many times over. And it would help boost us to the very top of the most important champions&apos; league. \u2022 Marjorie Scardino is chief executive officer of Pearson, an education media company and publisher of Penguin books and the Financial Times"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/16/china-defends-latest-web-censorship", "publicationDate": "2008-12-16T12:58:50Z", "tags": ["Digital media", "Media", "China", "World news", "Censorship", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["&quot;For instance, if a website refers to &apos;two Chinas&apos; or refers to mainland China and Taiwan as two independent regions, we believe that violates China&apos;s anti-secession law, as well as other laws,&quot; Liu added."], "title": "China defends latest web censorship", "article": "Chinese government officials have defended their decision to block several foreign news websites, including the BBC, as the country moves away from its pledge for uncensored internet access during the Beijing Olympics.

While students from Asian nations continue to dominate the fields of maths and science, the US made distinct gains in maths and maintained a respectable performance in science. The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) measures maths and science achievement in the 4th and 8th grades. In 2007, 48 countries participated at the 8th grade level and 36 participated at the 4th grade level. Singapore ranked the highest in science for both grades, while Taiwan&apos;s 8th graders and Hong Kong&apos;s 4th graders were the top performers in maths.  Lately, there has been much wringing of hands in the US over American students&apos; performance on international assessments like the TIMSS, in which they were being thoroughly trounced by their global peers. The current &quot;world is flat&quot; mentality cautions that unless maths and science education improve dramatically, the US can expect a grim economic future, in which the next generation of Googles and Microsofts will come from places like India and China instead of Seattle. Yet while the US continues to fail to top the chart, fixating solely on the horse-race nature of the TIMSS rankings ignores one of the positive aspects of the findings: the notable growth in US scores. Both 4th and 8th graders in the US improved their maths performance between 1995 and 2007, by 11% and 16% respectively, in addition to significantly reducing the black/white and Latino/white achievement gaps, in some instances by nearly 20% points.  As Education Sector&apos;s Chad Alderman puts it: &quot;While it&apos;s technically accurate to say the US had the ninth-highest score in 8th grade maths, for example, just that number alone does not do justice to the truth. Five countries (Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan) scored significantly above us, five countries scored about where we did (Hungary, England, Russia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic) and 37 countries scored well below us (including places like Australia, Sweden and Norway). Similar tiers exist across 4th and 8th grades for maths and science.&quot; The tiers he describes show that far from being at the bottom of the heap, the US has maintained an above-average presence, scoring well above the majority of other testing nations while simultaneously shrinking a shameful racial achievement gap. Moving forward, the growth shown on the TIMSS should be capitalised upon. President-elect Barack Obama has frequently tied academic improvement to his messaging on economic competitiveness, suggesting that education could prove a priority for the incoming federal government. The movement toward national education standards (in which all 50 states would be held to the same benchmarks in subjects like science, maths and reading) could spark greater rigour and accountability in these areas. High-performing states like Massachusetts, which has been experimenting with a longer school day and year, should also be looked to for leadership as other states work to raise their own achievement.

Start at a possible bad end. When great powers rise and fall, there&apos;s an increased danger of war - not today or tomorrow, but in a timescale of decades. That proposition does not imply any judgment on Chinese culture or national character. It merely reflects a recurrent pattern of history, seen across thousands of years in many different regions and cultures. The war may not be started by the ascendant power. It may be started by the declining power, with defensive aggression. It may even be against someone else. (The hegemonic transfer from Britain to the US came as both were fighting Nazi Germany.) There is nothing remotely original or offensive in this line of thought. The very notion of &quot;peaceful rise&quot;, launched by a leading Communist party thinker a few years ago, was predicated on the same insight: that, historically, nations&apos; rises have often not been peaceful. (The preferred official term may now be &quot;peaceful development&quot;, but &quot;peaceful rise&quot; is analytically much sharper.) So that&apos;s the long-term risk: war. But the long-term opportunity is equally large: imagine one-fifth of humankind organised in a single modern, prosperous state, playing a constructive part in a co-operative international system and tackling trans- national challenges, such as global warming, which threaten us all. So the stakes are huge, either way. Now let&apos;s be clear on one thing. What China does, whether it goes on rising and if so, how, is mainly up to the Chinese: legally, since theirs is a sovereign state; morally, since peoples have a right to shape their own destinies; but also practically, since the capacity of anyone else to influence the evolution of such a large, self-referential country is limited. Limited, but far from nil. This is not the 17th century. The prospects for the Chinese economy in 2009 depend directly on what happens in the American and European markets for Chinese exports. So we who are not Chinese have not just a stake, but also a hand in this story.  I have therefore come up with this shortlist of four keys to China&apos;s peaceful rise, attaching to each point a rough guesstimate of the division of responsibility (DoR) between us. In the confines of a column, my list is necessarily selective and of telegraphic brevity. I offer it with the health warning that on this subject I depend heavily on the expertise of others, and on Chinese voices interpreted or self-translated into English. Since, however, those experts and Chinese voices profoundly disagree among themselves, we outsiders still have to make up our own minds. Anyway, to stir debate, here are my four keys to China&apos;s peaceful rise. I welcome all responses, however critical, from those who are experts on China or, better still, are Chinese themselves. 1. Domestic Evolution (DoR: China, 90%; Rest of World, 10%) Surely the biggest single key. What&apos;s so interesting about talking to Chinese scholars, journalists and officials is their shared sense that the Chinese system is on a long, exciting journey to an unknown destination. After 30 years of incremental economic reform, they look forward to 30 years of incremental political reform. The rule of law, improved governance and elements of democracy (though not full-dress western-style liberal democracy) are all mentioned as part of the mix. The diversity of provinces and cities - as well as Hong Kong and, indirectly, even Taiwan - gives the chance for experimentation. Unlike in the United States or Britain, the expectation is that in 30 years&apos; time the political system will be qualitatively different from what it is today. Nobody knows what it will be.  I suggest that those of us in the rest of the world who believe in the virtues of liberal democracy should respond roughly thus: &quot;We wish you all good fortune on this journey. If you feel you can take something useful from our experience - the technology transfer of governance, so to speak - we will be delighted. We think you will find in the end that liberal democracy is the best way to run a country, but we welcome this ideological competition. If you can come up with a different system that durably satisfies the aspirations of your people, we shall greet it with fascination and respect. If not, we too will suffer the negative consequences.&quot; 2. The US-China Special Relationship  (DoR: US, 65%; China, 35%) In recent months, I argued in both China and the United States that the EU-China relationship should be strengthened to match the US-China one. In both countries I came away with a flea in my ear. Both sides clearly believe their relationship is unique. Very well then: over to you guys.  The larger responsibility must lie with the currently more powerful state. The Obama administration should make an offer of strategic partnership to Beijing, starting with issues such as climate change and nuclear proliferation. For its part, China needs to step beyond its current paradigm, which is (I parody slightly): &quot;What matters to us in the world is what&apos;s good for our domestic development, and what&apos;s good for our domestic development will be good for the world.&quot; 3. From G8 to G14  (DoR: the west, 70%; China, 30%) Tempting though it may be to some Chinese - &quot;How about G2?&quot; one scholar teased me in Shanghai - it&apos;s obvious that Sino-American dyarchy can&apos;t work on its own. The decision to go from G8 to G14 (or thereabouts) should be made already by the G8 summit in Italy in 2009. But &quot;G8 to G14&quot; is also shorthand for other ways in which China has to be given a larger role in the structures of global governance, including global financial institutions.  There&apos;s a trade-off here. Parodying slightly again, one could say that the west wants China to take more responsibility without giving it more power, while China wants more power without taking more responsibility. We&apos;ll have to meet somewhere in the middle. 4. Deep cultural and social engagement  (DoR: 50-50) The peaceful power shift from Britain to the United States was facilitated by the fact that they were culturally about as close as it is possible for two different countries to be. Brits and Americans speak the same language, more or less. America and China - the west altogether and China - are culturally very different. They don&apos;t speak the same language.  Mutual understanding requires a correspondingly greater effort. China is using some of its foreign currency reserves to send its students to American and British universities; we should be using our resources to welcome them here, and send more of our own students there with the necessary language training. Our newspapers should report China in as much detail as we do the United States. We should encourage people-to-people exchanges on a massive scale, and use the potential of the internet. For a meeting of minds, the best thing of all is still a personal meeting - but these days, we don&apos;t need to meet to get talking. timothygartonash.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/dec/23/pakistan-missile-strikes-saqqara-tombs", "publicationDate": "2008-12-23T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["World news"], "sentences": ["Associated Press in Saqqara Tight security for flight of pandas to Taiwan More than 500 security guards and armed police kept watch yesterday at an airport in south-west China where a pair of pandas were due to take off today for their new home in Taiwan, state media reported.", "Beijing first offered the pandas, Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, to Taiwan in 2005, hoping that they would strengthen Taiwanese public support for reuniting with the mainland."], "title": "World news in brief", "article": "Suspected US missiles kill eight in border tribal area Suspected missile strikes from US drones killed eight people yesterday in the South Waziristan tribal area of north-west Pakistan, where al-Qaida and Taliban leaders are believed to be hiding, according to officials and witnesses.

In the latest example of so-called &quot;panda diplomacy&quot; \u2013 the most famous example of which saw Mao Zedong send a pair of the animals to the US in 1972 after Richard Nixon&apos;s historic visit \u2013 Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan were packed into special portable cages and loaded on to a charter flight in south-west China. Chinese state TV carried live footage as the plane, its interior decorated with panda pictures, took off from Chengdu airport in Sichuan province at the start of the three-hour flight to Taiwan. &quot;I wish them a happy life in Taiwan,&quot; said a tearful Qu Chunmao, one of the pandas&apos; keepers at the Wolong breeding centre where they were raised. Another keeper and a vet flew with the animals to make sure they suffered no ill effects from the journey. The plane carried about half a tonne of Sichuanese bamboo and some steamed corn buns in case the pair initially reject the food served at the zoo in Taipei, Taiwan&apos;s capital. Taiwanese TV later showed its own live footage of the Eva Airways Boeing 747 touching down in Taipei. The four-year-old pandas \u2013 or &quot;furry goodwill ambassadors&quot;, as one report called them \u2013 will spend a month in quarantine before emerging before the public in time for the lunar new year public holiday. Beijing first offered the pandas in 2005 but they were rejected by the then president, Chen Shui-bian, whose Democratic Progressive party (DPP) supported moves towards independence for Taiwan. The island split politically from the mainland in 1949 after nationalist forces routed by Mao&apos;s communists fled there. Taiwan&apos;s new president, Ma Ying-jeou, has tried to forge closer ties with China and accepted the pandas as a goodwill gesture. Pandas have long been an important symbol of Chinese diplomatic overtures to both allies and former foes. In the past, Beijing has given the animals to countries including North Korea, the Soviet Union and Japan. The dispatch of Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan has received heavy media coverage in China, beginning today with a pre-dawn ceremony at the breeding centre in which children dressed up as pandas performed a dance as the animals were loaded on to a truck. A special set of stamps has been issued marking the event. Some in Taiwan are suspicious of the gift. When put together, the names Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan mean &quot;reunion&quot; in Chinese. Beijing insists Taiwan is a rogue province and has long threatened to bring it back under Chinese rule by force. The lavish farewell ceremony at Chengdu airport, involving speeches and more dancing, carefully avoided any statements of overt political intent from Beijing. &quot;Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan will sow the seeds of peace, solidarity and friendship on Taiwan&apos;s soil,&quot; said Zheng Lizhong, from Beijing&apos;s Taiwan Affairs Office, according to the AFP news agency. The pandas were leaving &quot;with the good wishes of the 1.3 billion mainland compatriots&quot;, Zheng said. While many Taiwanese want to see a reunion, others view it as a threat to the island&apos;s democratic system and higher living standards. A spokesman for the DPP, now in opposition, said the pandas &quot;will not cover up China&apos;s military threat against us&quot;. China still has hundreds of missiles aimed at Taiwan but in recent years it has focused less on sabre rattling and more on increasing economic and social ties. A significant proportion of Taiwan&apos;s economy is now reliant on factories on the mainland, and Beijing has offered Taiwanese investors assistance to weather the global economic downturn.

Bankers? You must be joking. Bankers were feathering their balance sheets with \u00a350bn in real money given them by Gordon Brown as a reward for their antics in 2008. The people who were rescuing the economy were consumers spending what little money the government had left them. They packed supermarkets, malls, high streets and eBay websites, helping keep the retail sector, its suppliers and thus the economy going. The government has now allocated to the banks the equivalent of \u00a31,000 from every man, woman and child in Britain. This was supposedly to &quot;maintain confidence&quot; and thus continue the flow of lending. The flow has not occurred. It must be the most costly single failure of policy in peacetime. Yet the cry from politicians and the financial press is for more. Economic policy has not progressed beyond the Somme. Banks are not lending for a simple reason. As demand plummets and unemployment soars - by a predicted one million next year - there are no good debts to be found. Bankers have been pilloried by ministers all autumn for recklessly incurring bad debts, mostly to first-time housebuyers at the bidding of those same ministers. They are disinclined to make that mistake again. Attacking banks is satisfying and makes good copy, but they are behaving predictably. They are using the Treasury&apos;s largesse, which means our taxes, to bind up their bruised balance sheets and not incur bad debts at the start of a recession. They are saving. When there was a chance of propping up confidence, there was a case for helping banks. Now the Treasury is throwing good money after bad. It is taxing and saving, the daftest policy in a recession. If 2008 was the year of the bank, 2009 should be the year of the consumer. The recovery should be &quot;kick-started&quot; by boosting spending, not saving, and the people best qualified to spend are spenders. Over the holiday millions showed how. They went out and bought goods and services in the marketplace. They helped keep desperate shops, pubs, garages and hotels in business, and thus also their employees and suppliers. Earlier this month I suggested simply giving the lavish sums being expended on banks back to consumers in the form of three-month spending coupons, say of \u00a3300 a month. The proposal is being actively considered to boost demand in Germany, Taiwan, Australia and elsewhere. It is better than VAT reductions, tax credits or ponderous public works contracts in instantaneously translating subsidy into demand. At the very least it puts money into the economy rather than taking it out, as do Alastair Darling&apos;s banking subsidies. The proposal&apos;s critics fell back unerringly on Britain&apos;s patrician tradition of economic control. Giving people (their own) money was vulgar. It should be laundered through those who knew about such things, such as policymakers and banks. Most people would spend on fripperies rather than noble manufactures. They would buy imports, get drunk, indulge in leisure, Starbucks and hairdressing. Even if the vouchers were not cashable, people might sell them in the grey market to help to pay their mortgages (just what banks are doing with the same money). None of these possible consequences is economically damaging and all would stimulate demand. All would leave the public rather than the Treasury to spend the way out of recession, on the assumption it will do it quicker and more wisely. Why tax people to build cars they do not want, rather than giving them money to buy cars they do? There is nothing wrong in buying imports during a world recession. There is no shame in services and leisure, which are labour intensive and thus important at a time of rising unemployment. There is no guilt in shopping. Retailing, like tourism, underpins demand. The truth is that ministers are letting small businesses fail because these are run by people they do not know. What friend of the secretary of state for business, Lord Mandelson, ever owned a corner shop? Economic policy has long been distorted by favour and prejudice. Reckless lending to poor housebuyers was good when it bought Blair and Brown votes. Now rising debt has made it bad. Helping big projects like the Olympics is good because it offers photo-opportunities, but helping leisure services is what John Prescott called &quot;Mickey Mouse economics&quot;. Labour economic policy enters 2009 in the mode adopted by Margaret Thatcher and Geoffrey Howe in the recession of 1981-2. It is turning the recessionary screw and suppressing demand just when the economy appears to need a boost. (Yet where are 1981&apos;s 365 economists writing to the Times to protest?) Thatcher and Howe at least had excuses - inflation was already at double figures and British industry was chronically in need of restructuring. Brown and Darling are sucking the private sector dry just when it most needs moisture. They are protecting public sector pensions, raising the minimum wage and giving banks stupefying amounts of public money, knowing that this money is being withdrawn from circulation and will be saved, not spent. If there is one sentiment that should have died in 2008 it is faith in the collective intelligence of Whitehall. The economic forecasters league table for 2008 was published last week and, of the 42 pundits listed, no public authority was in the top half. The Treasury came in at 37th and the IMF was bottom. This is the mob that brought us City deregulation and the house-price bubble. Yet I doubt if a single one has been upbraided, let alone sacked. The entire Bank of England monetary policy committee is still in office - except for the only one who called the recession correctly, David Blanchflower, who has mysteriously been stood down. This is not some City luncheon parlour game. As a result of the arrogance of these economic managers, a million people will lose their jobs next year and tens of thousands their houses. Yet all they think to do, egged on by politicians, is take more money from spenders and give it to savers, to their beloved City banks. Banking is a profession that excels at making money for itself. For 10 years it mesmerised Blair and Brown, who showered it with tax loopholes, offshore profits, PFI contracts and vacuous government consultancies. Ministers and bankers enjoyed a revolving Whitehall door. Frustrated ministers are still expecting the City to rescue the economy in 2009, continuing to trust it with the public&apos;s money to an extent that they will not trust the public. They seem unaware that bankers do not rescue economies. They rescue banks. simon.jenkins@theguardian.com"}]}
