She&apos;s on springs, despite just having arrived in London after stops in Paris, Taiwan and Hong Kong. But perhaps that&apos;s not surprising: from her earliest action films, energy has always characterised her work. We meet in an apartment where glossy copies of Variety magazine are strewn around us, their covers trumpeting potential Oscar contenders such as Frost/Nixon and The Reader. Yeoh, 46, is no stranger to that world. After impressing as the Bond girl Wai Lin in Tomorrow Never Dies in 1997, she went on to star in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee&apos;s Oscar-winning martial-arts love story of 2000.  It was one of the biggest non-English language hits of all time. But the film she has come to discuss is more mesmerising than most of the titles likely to be vying for Hollywood doorstops next February, the mesmerising Far North, directed by the British filmmaker Asif Kapadia and shot on Svalbard, in the Arctic Ocean above Norway, the most northern settlement in the world. Yeoh plays Saiva, who passes her days in the icy wasteland hunting animals with her companion, Anja (Michelle Krusiec), and reflecting on a life that has been cursed ever since a shaman declared she was bad juju. Wandering the plains one day, who should she find curled up on the ice but Sean Bean? Many women would consider this a boon. But once Bean has thawed out, his presence jeopardises the women&apos;s relationship, with unsettling consequences. &quot;When I got the script,&quot; Yeoh says, &quot;I thought: either my agent wants to kill me or he&apos;s telling me I need a challenge.&quot; She gives an emphatic laugh. Like all her films, Far North was hugely physically demanding. Yeoh, who made her name as an action star in Hong Kong in the early to mid 90s, is probably the actor of her age most likely to be found begging a director to stuff the insurers and let her perform her own stunts. While Far North might seem worlds away from movies such as Police Story 3: Supercop (memorable for one particularly awesome motorcycle leap on to a moving train), what they have in common is the sheer stamina each has required of her. Indeed it was the harsh conditions and natural hazards that attracted her to Far North, she says. But then it&apos;s probably a breeze to work under constant threat of polar bear attack when you&apos;ve acted alongside Vin Diesel, as Yeoh did in Babylon AD. &quot;On Far North, we were always aware of being at the whim of mother nature,&quot; she says. &quot;She&apos;s the biggest star in the film. But I had always longed to go to the North Pole, and the best time to go somewhere is when you&apos;re working on a film. You can roll up your sleeves, get to know the people. That&apos;s what I did - I spent time with the locals, I hung out with them, soaked them up, watched how they move and sit, with their legs slightly spread, their shoulders hunched. They don&apos;t have big gestures but their movements are basic, refined, pure.&quot; She says that the role itself took her &quot;to dark places most of us can&apos;t get our heads around. We were all living together on a boat, an ice breaker, with all this jaw-dropping scenery around us - all those miles and miles of nothing.&quot; You sense that Far North, like her role last year in Danny Boyle&apos;s science-fiction thriller Sunshine, came as something of a tonic after the big-budget productions she&apos;s done - from Tomorrow Never Dies to Memoirs of a Geisha (&quot;Two-and-a-half hours in makeup - every day!&quot;) to the recent Mummy threequel, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. &quot;It&apos;s so important for me to do my own stunts,&quot; Yeoh says. &quot;The sense of achievement is so immense. But the studios don&apos;t want to take the risk. &apos;You&apos;re an actor, actors don&apos;t do stunts!&apos; And if they do let you do anything, they wrap you in so much cotton wool it takes away the fun anyway.&quot;  Yeoh, who was born Yeoh Chu-Kheng to an affluent Chinese-Malay family in Ipoh, Malaysia, has always been interested in using her body to express herself. &quot;Body language is more fascinating to me than actual language,&quot; she says. &quot;Before you get into the mind, you have to inhabit the physicality. Body language is a great way of speaking.&quot; She says she has to use her body &quot;to help the audience overcome the fact that they are watching Michelle Yeoh - I have to rid myself of my usual mannerisms, my usual way of moving and behaving, so that they see only the role, and don&apos;t think of, say, Crouching Tiger.&quot;  Given that she sees her body as her prime mode of self-expression, it&apos;s not hard to imagine the trauma she suffered at the age of 16 when her hopes of becoming a ballet dancer were dashed by a back injury. At the time she was studying at London&apos;s Royal Academy of Dance, hoping to become a prima ballerina. &quot;People talk about seeing their dreams shattered, but that really happened to me,&quot; she says. &quot;The doctor asked me, &apos;Have you ever thought of doing something other than dance?&apos; Suddenly it hit me: he wasn&apos;t joking.&quot; The principal pointed out to Yeoh that ballet was only a small part of dance, and that there were other ways for her to express physicality. Although she couldn&apos;t carry on with her dance degree, Yeoh stayed on at the Royal Academy, studying choreography instead, and graduated in 1982 with a BA in creative arts with a minor in drama. It is to be hoped that the kindly principal who advised her back then has since got around to renting out The Story of Stuntwoman Ah Kam, released in 1996, in which Yeoh falls 18ft on to her head, or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, where her limbs, muscular and graceful, move at such speed they are a constant blur. After leaving the Academy, Yeoh returned briefly to Malaysia - just long enough for her mother to enter her into a beauty pageant. She picked up the Miss Malaysia title, seemingly the way other people pick up colds, and went on to take part in Miss World (which she did not win). This particular career trajectory was interrupted when, in Hong Kong, she caught the eye of the billionaire studio head Dickson Poon. He persuaded her to make commercials (she starred opposite Jackie Chan in her first one) and then convinced her to sign a movie contract with his company, D&amp;B Films. Poon then completed a hat-trick by asking Yeoh to marry him. She still expresses surprise that their wedding, in 1988, was a cover story in Hong Kong. But here&apos;s the strange part: having launched Yeoh&apos;s career, after they married in 1988, Poon asked her to quit acting. Why did she agree? Yeoh explains, patiently, that she was entirely in accord with her then-husband&apos;s wishes. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a hard decision because I saw marriage as a full existence. I see someone now like Emma Thompson or Kate Winslet, who can juggle their careers and their family life, but that felt beyond me then. Maybe it comes from the Asian culture, but my thinking was that I couldn&apos;t be running around all over the world, jumping off buildings, if I was going to give my marriage 100%. When I choose to do something, I always give it my complete commitment. If I feel I&apos;ve done my best, and it&apos;s not going the way it should, then I&apos;ll leave. That&apos;s what I did with my marriage.&quot; When Yeoh and Boon divorced after just over three years of marriage, she was surprised to find her stock was still high in the film industry . &quot;No one thought I&apos;d left for good - they were keeping my seat warm for me. So I jumped back in.&quot; Earlier this year Yeoh announced her engagement to Jean Todt, the French executive director of Ferrari&apos;s formula one team. What if he were to suggest she give up acting? &quot;He would never do that,&quot; she says. &quot;He would never ask that of me. He&apos;s very sensible and supportive. He even came out to see me during Far North. And when he wasn&apos;t there, he sent me food packages.&quot; This is good news indeed. It would be a shame if Yeoh were to call time on a career in which she has punched and kicked in the face of so many industry prejudices. As an Asian woman in her mid forties, her every appearance on screen defies mainstream cinema&apos;s bias towards the youthful, and the Caucasian. &quot;I appreciate I am very blessed, so I do work my hardest when I get the opportunity,&quot; she says. &quot;Asian performers have always had to fight cliched roles - the Suzie Wong type, the Chinatown waitress, the Chinatown-whatever. Even 10 years ago, they were the only roles available. You would think I would&apos;ve been working non-stop after Tomorrow Never Dies, but my next western film wasn&apos;t until Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon three years later. Why? Because no one was offering me the roles I wanted. It was still the same old stereotypes. If you look at my CV, there&apos;s not a big repertoire. Things are getting better now, but the same problem still arises sometimes. When I told my agent I wanted to work with Danny Boyle on Sunshine, he said, &apos;There&apos;s not really a role there for an Asian face.&apos; But that&apos;s the thing: I&apos;m not an Asian face. I&apos;m an actress. That&apos;s what we need to overcome.&quot; Take that!Five key Yeoh films Police Story 3: Supercop (1992) Yeoh&apos;s triumphant return to acting after a three-year hiatus was one of her most demanding roles. As a mainland Chinese police officer assisting Hong Kong cop Jackie Chan on an undercover assignment in China, she more than held her own alongside her more famous sidekick, matching him stunt for daredevil stunt. Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) Yeoh was an unknown quantity to Western audiences when she appeared opposite Pierce Brosnan in his second Bond movie. Her quick-witted, no-nonsense performance refused to adhere to the Bond girl stereotype of subservient eye-candy: Brosnan himself was so impressed by her stylishness, daring and aplomb, he called her &quot;the female James Bond&quot;. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) This was the one for Yeoh - in Ang Lee&apos;s peculiarly tender martial arts adventure, she found a role that married her physical prowess to her subtle acting skills. Whether yearning gently for Chow Yun-Fat or trading blows 40ft in the air with young pretender Zhang Ziyi, Yeoh took your breath away. Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) There was controversy over the casting of Chinese actors in Japanese parts, but Yeoh&apos;s performance as the graceful mentor to the film&apos;s heroine again gave her another valuable opportunity, after Crouching Tiger,to express her physical dexterity and dance background in a substantial acting role. Sunshine (2007) It&apos;s a testament to Yeoh&apos;s flexibility that she fitted in seamlessly as an environmentally concerned astronaut in Danny Boyle&apos;s science-fiction thriller, filmed at 3 Mills Studios in east London. As an admirer of Boyle&apos;s work, she lobbied hard for the part, which was written for a younger, non-Asian actor. \u2022 Far North is in cinemas now"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/09/feng-xiaogang-box-office-record", "publicationDate": "2009-01-09T13:14:51Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "China", "Asia Pacific", "Chinese new year"], "sentences": ["While his work is popular in Hong Kong, Taiwan and south-east Asia, If You Are the One is unlikely to get a European release."], "title": "Chinese director sets 1bn yuan box-office record", "article": "Feng Xiaogang has become the first Chinese director to earn more than 1bn yuan (\u00a395m) at the box office, according to the Hollywood Reporter. While western audiences are more likely to be aware of the big-budget martial arts epics of his compatriot Zhang Yimou, Feng ploughs his own furrow with assistance from the Chinese government, which has been increasing investment in homegrown films in the past few years to help them compete with Hollywood&apos;s efforts as well as movies from US-backed Hong Kong studios. Feng specialises in a genre known as the &quot;hesui pian&quot; (Chinese New Year films): usually lighthearted, feelgood films that arrive in time for the festive period. He passed the 1bn yuan milestone after his latest film, If You Are the One, took more than 310m yuan (\u00a329.5m) in China. It marks a return to the style for which the director is best known after his 2007 war film Assembly, and features his longtime collaborator Ge You. The 50-year-old director, who never attended film school and began his career as an army theatre troupe scene painter, is proud to admit his commercial leanings. &quot;A film is like a cup of wine,&quot; he once said. &quot;I&apos;m trying to ensure that the audience gets the most fun and inspiration from the screen. But I would never make a movie to win an award.&quot; Feng&apos;s films are usually approved in their entirety by China&apos;s strict censors, unlike many western films, which are often cut for theatrical release. While his work is popular in Hong Kong, Taiwan and south-east Asia, If You Are the One is unlikely to get a European release. Feng&apos;s lavish 2006 costume drama, The Banquet, made it to the UK under the title Legend of the Black Scorpion, as did Assembly. But they failed to take much at the box office, and experts predict the already small market for Chinese fare in Europe may shrink further in the current economic climate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2009/jan/12/malaysia", "publicationDate": "2009-01-12T10:50:39Z", "tags": ["Malaysia", "World news"], "sentences": ["Japan, then Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, did it first."], "title": "Malaysians want what we want", "article": "Even on holiday, you never quite lose working habits when passing through other countries. Are they disfigured by all too evident slums? Is the police presence very obvious on the streets. Does it look heavy-handed, too? Does the citizenry look cheerful and prosperous, or miserable, cowed and poor? By such tests, Malaysia, where I spent some time over Christmas, looks prosperous and promising, a fast-industrialising state whose middle class inhabitants seem to want roughly what we want \u2013 and are in the process of getting, or even exceeding, it. That is really the lesson from all over Asia now: they want what Europe, North America and Australasia have. Japan, then Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, did it first. The others are fast catching up, though bad economic and political policies can derail progress \u2013 oppression in Burma and North Korea today, corruption a generation ago in the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos, whose fall I witnessed in Manilla in 1986.I know: I&apos;m a tourist on holiday in the tourist areas, someone merely observing the surface of things and reading the local papers, which seem lively enough. When in Sarawak, an hour&apos;s flight across the South China Sea \u2013 &quot;the other side&quot;, as Malaysians put it \u2013 I took quite a shine to the Borneo Post, which has lots to read, even the occasional article on the economic travails of Premier Brown. Unsurprisingly, Malaysia and its near-neighbour, the overwhelming city state of Singapore, share many of the problems we all share with the rest of the world, its leaders offering reasons why they should survive the global recession better than some. Why Malaysia, which took such a beating in the Asian financial crisis of 1997 after a decade of 8% annual growth under Dr Mahathir Mohamad? Partly because it claims to have learned lessons, like better regulation, partly because it is more diversified economically now, and probably better run too. As for Singapore, rents are falling on the retail strip that is Orchard Road (it makes Oxford Street look a bit cheesy) and growth was only 1.5% last year. But it, too, expects to batten down the hatches and get through the typhoon year of 2009 in good order. Malaysia is more striking because everyone knows that Singapore \u2013 like Hong Kong before it \u2013 has successfully managed to combine efficient market economies with a strong legal system and reasonably open politics, albeit with an authoritarian strain. On the last occasion I spent a few days in Singapore (only a half-day stopover this year), I quickly longed to see a bit of litter. When I finally spotted a fag packet on the roadside, my host explained: &quot;Today&apos;s a public holiday, it will be gone tomorrow.&quot; I&apos;m sure it was. But Malaysia is a predominantly Muslim state, where the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition has been in power since independence from Britain. That initially happened in 1957, and has taken its current federated form since 1963: Chinese Singapore broke away in 1965 and ethnic tensions between the main groups, Malay (65%), Chinese (27%) Indian (8%) have never quite gone away. The opposition three-party coalition made unprecedented gain in last March&apos;s elections, though it is not without internal tensions too. There was political chicanery and anti-government demos, poorly policed, in 2007. Dr Mahathir urged Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, his successor as PM since 2003, to quit after the March setback (sound familiar?), and one of the ruling coalition&apos;s Borneo factions threatened to defect on the grounds that they were &quot;made to sleep near the toilet&quot; in the government&apos;s coalition bungalow. A lively metaphor, but Malaysia&apos;s is a Westminster-style system and it staggers on. Where did my sense of optimism stem from in Kuala Lumpur and later in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, the south-west chunk of north Borneo, just two degrees north of the equator? Not from the twinned Petronas Towers, briefly the world&apos;s tallest building, in whose shopping malls we trundled. Striking though they look, they also look like someone \u2013 Mahathir? \u2013 trying too hard. It came mainly from the evidence of well-dressed families playing with their kids in well-planned parks over the Christmas break (now a near-universal celebration, complete with Silent Night in the shopping malls and hotels), of the absence of policemen \u2013 and even the absence of bad drains, the kind that can stop visitors in their tracks in much of Asia (India for example). Oh yes, something I have previously noticed in Malaysia, a moderate Sunni Islam society, is the conspicuous presence of assertive Muslim women leading what look very normal lives in which their faith has been integrated with modern secular aspirations of the kind Guardian readers share. You can see it from the way they dress (there are some very fashionable hijabs), talk and generally conduct themselves in public. But the most striking thing, to my mind, was the absence of slums. I am sure there is still a lot of rural poverty and backwardness. Parts of Sarawak and neighbouring Saba are still pretty remote, and much of the peninsula \u2013 the long finger down from Thailand and Burma \u2013 are not as developed as KL and the south. But slums can be hard to hide, even on the trip to the airport, in many countries. What was much more in evidence \u2013 in provincial Kuching as well as sprawling KL, its core population of 1.6 million \u2014 was mile upon mile of middle class, two-storey, brick homes of a kind you might find being built, unimaginatively, by Barratt or Wimpey, albeit without the wide verandas which protect Asians from their rain. If you moved into one of these houses, terraced or semi-detatched (and you could quite comfortably and not miss a big match in the Premier League on your huge flat screen TV), you would be glad of extra shelter from tropical rain, though cross about the absence of decent buses. In its new affluence, middle class Malaysia seems to drive. No surprise there either, though what it means for the planet is something I suspect that many Malaysians, in their rush to prosperity, regard as someone else&apos;s worry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/jan/12/telstra-htc-phone", "publicationDate": "2009-01-12T18:10:53Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Mobile phones"], "sentences": ["Smarthouse reports: &quot;Mobile phone company HTC is set to launch a brand new phone touch phone that will take on the Apple iPhone and the new Pre offering from Palm claims a senior executive of Telstra.&quot; Telstra staff say:  &quot;We have seen both and we believe that the new HTC phone will be a real competitor to the iPhone and the Pre which at this stage looks nice but is still not delivered to market.&quot;  Taiwan-based HTC already makes the Touch and Touch HD phones, which are based on Microsoft&apos;s Windows Mobile."], "title": "HTC will take on both iPhone and Palm Pre", "article": "Smarthouse reports: &quot;Mobile phone company HTC is set to launch a brand new phone touch phone that will take on the Apple iPhone and the new Pre offering from Palm claims a senior executive of Telstra.&quot; Telstra staff say:  &quot;We have seen both and we believe that the new HTC phone will be a real competitor to the iPhone and the Pre which at this stage looks nice but is still not delivered to market.&quot;  Taiwan-based HTC already makes the Touch and Touch HD phones, which are based on Microsoft&apos;s Windows Mobile.

Mostly rough stone huts, a single room, primitive fireplace and no window, they were set in the woods on the edge of the town. Out of sight then, but excavated and respectfully preserved nowadays. That is a crucial part of the story. Who were these miners, the 100-strong community who had come so far across dangerous seas in search of a fortune in the then-remote mountains above Queenstown, now the South Island&apos;s premier all-season resort? For the most part young peasants escaping economic hardship and political turmoil in Guangdong province \u2013 European colonialists called it Canton \u2013 just north of Hong Kong. As geographical mobility was enhanced at the end of the 19th century by steam ships, trains, the telegraph and \u2013 most of all \u2013 by newly discovered lands and opportunities \u2013 ambitious or hungry young men (sometimes women and children too) were on the move all over the world. Then, as now, some planned to make enough money to go home and live in comfort, though relatively few actually did. Then, as now, they sent money back to families, moved into other trades and settled, or got sick and died. Then, as now, people from their own neighbourhood joined them in the process known as &quot;chain migration&quot;. The United States was the biggest magnet for European migrants who had no plans or desire to go home, though Latin America, the cooler parts of Africa and Australasia also attracted incomers. We know about them, just as we know about the Indians who went to east Africa to trade, to Fiji or \u2013 VS Naipaul territory \u2013 the West Indies who became indentured labourers and stayed. In a reverse migration after the second world war, people from the former European empires came to Europe too \u2013 though their sights were not set as high as those 19th-century Chinese gold miners, who spread all over the Pacific \u2013 Australia and California too \u2013 in search of that precious yellow metal. We know less about what China calls its Overseas Chinese here in Britain because they barely impacted upon our own story in the way that people from the Indian subcontinent did. Chinese restaurants alongside Indian ones in every small town are one thing, factory hands and doctors in big cities quite another. The Chinese had been trading and migrating among their Pacific neighbours for centuries, but the double blow of the 19th century \u2013 the steady internal collapse of the Qing/Manchu dynasty and the external imperial incursions of Europe, the US and fast-modernising Japan \u2013 gave new incentives to leave, sometimes under duress, and not just to find gold either. In Sarawak, Malaysia, last month I met an elegant 95-year-old widow who crossed the perilous South China sea \u2013 from Fujian province opposite Taiwan island to Borneo \u2013 in a junk when she was 20, to marry a peasant to whom she had been betrothed at 10. Like their migrant counterparts in America they prospered \u2013 growing rubber, pepper, a sideline in soya sauce \u2013 and educated their children. Their grandchildren now live in Singapore, Perth, Sydney and London (among them my daughter-in-law) as well as Sarawak. The result is that all around the Pacific Rim established states, where such people now work in Silicon Valley or Brisbane real estate, are trying to create a coherent narrative that does not marginalise the Chinese dimension \u2013 or squeeze it into stone huts down by the river. In parallel there is a huge effort under way to embrace the role of the &quot;original inhabitants&quot; or &quot;indigenous Australians&quot; (Aboriginal as a noun is frowned upon), and the Maoris in New Zealand. Likewise the Inuit and Native Americans in Canada and the US, and their counterparts in Latin America, where &quot;native&quot; leaders are now getting elected president, their equivalent of the US&apos;s Obama moment. You can see the process in the museums and art galleries of Australia and NZ, where indigenous art \u2013 the pointillist aboriginal paintings, those highly distinctive Maori carvings \u2013 is given equal billing with that of European origin. In Wellington&apos;s striking, postmodern Te Papa national museum this week I noted that the curators have sought to compare European and Maori creation myths, just as they now give pride of place to beautiful (though once dismissed as patronising) paintings of elaborately tattooed Maoris, as earnestly recorded by Victorian painters. Likewise due weight is given to rival migration stories, the 50,000 year isolation of Australia&apos;s inhabitants (and its wildlife) from Asia by the deep, dangerous Torres Strait, the Maori arrival in New Zealand \u2013 &quot;land of the long white cloud&quot; \u2013 west across the vast Pacific circa AD800-1300. And so on. Te Papa currently has an exhibition on the Kiwis&apos; Scottish inheritance, though the Poles get a mention too. Which is where the restored Chinese quarter at Arrowtown fits in. Hard-working and respectable, the Chinese miners were initially welcomed, but when times got tougher the usual &quot;yellow peril&quot; prejudices kicked in. Migration policies which were still in place until the 1970s and 80s kept Asian migrants out of Australia and New Zealand. As a young student from Hunan, Mao Zedong protested against anti-Chinese US immigration policy. They discriminate no longer. So the narrative has had to change and has been marked, in the modern fashion, by historic apologies for past wrongs and inclusive archaeology such as the informative display boards at Arrowtown. After all, Asian tourism is also crucial to the Kiwi economy. Chinese tourists were there the wet morning we visited. In New Zealand, where the Maori warrior tradition gave European colonists serious trouble, bilingualism in public places and documents is now routine, just as correct pronunciation is now given to many Maori place names, all part of the Maori revival. The Maori party is getting unprecedented consultation in the new conservative coalition in the Wellington parliament. As elsewhere, myriad tensions, historic, economic, political, remain to be resolved \u2013 or not. Despite the marketisation of the Kiwi economy \u2013 David Lange&apos;s Labour government started the process 25 years ago \u2013 and growing evidence of conspicuous wealth, New Zealand remains a comfortably social democratic society, less dynamic but also less brash or polarised than Australia. You never see beggars here, or slums, as you routinely do in the United States. In some ways it is easier for the Chinese, whose civilisation is immensely old, its historic achievements widely understood. Visiting Seattle&apos;s city museum 20 years ago \u2013 just as the Chinese global re-emergence was beginning \u2013 I was struck by its Pacific orientation; little of the European high art of New York or Washington, but dazzling displays of Chinese painting and pottery of 1,000 years ago and more. Quite what the new China makes of the Pacific Rim&apos;s efforts to reintegrate its culture remains to be seen. Human nature being what it is, for every Beijing official gratified by such museums another may prefer to remember the opium wars and other humiliations of the 19th century. Who burned down the imperial summer palace? Why, we did. Let us hope they decide to forgive us, for Balmoral&apos;s sake if nothing else. It is one of the new century&apos;s big questions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jan/16/obama-global-nuclear-proliferation", "publicationDate": "2009-01-16T18:00:01Z", "tags": ["US news", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "US national security", "World news", "Nuclear weapons", "US politics"], "sentences": ["Fourth, for political leaders and nuclear security managers who discount the seriousness of the threat of nuclear terrorism, the US must provide detailed briefings and threat assessments (including classified material, where appropriate) of recent nuclear security lapses, including the 2006 smuggling of weapons-grade uranium (pdf) in Georgia, the 2007 break-in at the Pelindaba nuclear facility in South Africa, the US air force&apos;s mistaken shipment (pdf) of ballistic missile components (instead of the intended helicopter batteries) to Taiwan in 2006 and the unauthorised transfer of nuclear weapons (pdf) from North Dakota to Louisiana in 2007."], "title": "Micah Zenko: What Barack Obama must do to combat nuclear terrorism", "article": "During a contentious 2004 presidential debate between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry, they addressed the question: &quot;What is the single most serious threat to American national security?&quot; The candidates found a common answer: nuclear terrorism.

The best news regarding nuclear security is that, despite differences over missile defences in eastern Europe and Georgia, the White House and the Kremlin have found a broader level of understanding over the seriousness of the nuclear terror threat.

The Bush administration also made little progress in confronting the two countries that could potentially transfer a bomb or the material to make one to a terrorist organisation: Iran and North Korea. Iran&apos;s uranium enrichment programme has shown quantitative and qualitative improvements, and the widely-respected Institute for Science and International Security estimates that Iran could produce enough highly-enriched uranium for a crude nuclear weapon in under one year (pdf). North Korea, despite a 2007 agreement to abandon its nuclear programmes, still possesses between eight to 13 bombs worth of plutonium. In addition, US national security adviser Steve Hadley recently warned of &quot;increasing concerns&quot; from the US intelligence community &quot;that North Korea has an ongoing covert uranium-enrichment programme&quot;. Among everything that remains undone for Obama, four actions stand out. First, he must name an official to the position of coordinator for the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation and terrorism, as mandated by law over 500 days ago to manage all US nuclear terrorism prevention efforts but never filled by Bush.  Second, the Obama administration must accelerate the diplomatic, financial and public-private sector initiatives to safely remove as much nuclear material as possible as quickly as possible from the more than 40 countries where it exists.  Third, there must be the continued dedication of intelligence collection efforts of facilities where nuclear materials are stored worldwide, including transport legs and possible terrorist nuclear plots. This effort should build upon work of the little-known, two-and-a-half-year old nuclear materials information programme, which integrates information worldwide on nuclear materials and their security status. Fourth, for political leaders and nuclear security managers who discount the seriousness of the threat of nuclear terrorism, the US must provide detailed briefings and threat assessments (including classified material, where appropriate) of recent nuclear security lapses, including the 2006 smuggling of weapons-grade uranium (pdf) in Georgia, the 2007 break-in at the Pelindaba nuclear facility in South Africa, the US air force&apos;s mistaken shipment (pdf) of ballistic missile components (instead of the intended helicopter batteries) to Taiwan in 2006 and the unauthorised transfer of nuclear weapons (pdf) from North Dakota to Louisiana in 2007. If terrorists detonated a nuclear device in a major metropolitan area, it would have immediate and harmful secondary effects. The revival of carbon-free nuclear energy would be curtailed, perhaps permanently. Civil liberties at home and abroad would be violated or watered-down in an effort to prevent future attacks. And it would, in the words of former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, &quot;stagger the world economy and thrust tens of millions of people into dire poverty&quot; creating &quot;a second death toll throughout the developing world&quot;. Short of urgent international action, led by the US, the congressionally-mandated commission on the prevention of WMD proliferation terrorism recently predicted that &quot;a weapon of mass destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013&quot;. The incoming Obama administration must advance the efforts of its predecessors to work to eliminate the most serious threat to the security of the US and the world."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/16/china", "publicationDate": "2009-01-16T21:00:01Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["(Taiwan is even worse hit in its vital export sector.)"], "title": "Jonathan Fenby: China's dragon is a more complex beast than some suggest", "article": "Perhaps it is the country&apos;s size, ancient civilisation and tumultuous modern history, or perhaps the result of its spectacular economic growth since Deng Xiaoping unleashed market-led economic reform 30 years ago. Whatever the reason, commentary on China seems all too easily trapped in hyperbole. Either the last major state on earth ruled by a Communist party is seen as a nascent giant dragon about to take over the planet or it is a weak pretender that lacks the political, economical and social resilience to live up to its pretensions. In the first case, this will be China&apos;s century. In the second, the People&apos;s Republic is an emperor without clothes whose nakedness has been shown up by slumping economic performance and a rising tide of internal protest, fulfilling all the criticisms of its one-party political system and the attendant faultlines. On the one hand is the image of a vast country with 1.3bn people moving inexorably to dominate the world now that it has freed itself from the shackles of the late imperial-Republican-Maoist century. For those who would welcome the end of the post-1945 global balance and the humbling of America, this is a most seductive prospect. On the other hand is the picture of a vast country with 1.3bn people going out of control, rent by internal strife and social disorder in a re-run of the enormous grassroots revolts of the mid-19th century or the civil war between the Nationalists and Communists. For those who like a good story and those who think that a repressive one-party state is not morally entitled to China&apos;s recent record of material success, this is an irresistible narrative to project on to the back of the current economic downturn. This week, the bulls were represented by the announcement that the growth of China&apos;s GDP in 2007 was being officially increased from 11.9% to 13%, taking the mainland ahead of Germany to become the world&apos;s third biggest national economy after the US and Japan. Even in the midst of predictions of doom for the first half of this year, prime minister Wen Jiabao was quoted on Monday as saying that the fiscal and monetary stimulus programme set in motion in November was already having an effect, and looking forward to China being the first big country to emerge from the crisis. On the other hand, some leading analysts have cut their predictions of growth this year to 5% as economic date shows continuing decline. The prominent exiled dissident, Wei Jingsheng warned in the Times of a tidal wave of discontent and the Guardian&apos;s Simon Tisdall, commenting on the current crackdown on political reform, saw the leadership in Beijing facing &quot;a painful reckoning with China&apos;s over-pressured and under-represented masses&quot;.  In this year stuffed with sensitive anniversaries, there is no doubting the scale of the challenge facing China after its go-go growth since 2002. The tensions have been building up for a long time. The process of rebalancing the economy to lessen its dependence on low-cost exports and boost consumption was always going to be difficult. The lack of a real welfare system and the growing wealth disparities are bound to fuel discontent. The one-party system and the lack of the rule of law mean safety valves are missing. Now the impact of the global crisis on the economy and the effect on tens of millions of migrant workers thrown out of jobs make it easy to foresee doom and gloom for the mainland. (Taiwan is even worse hit in its vital export sector.)  But, as the Beijing ducks come home to roost with every prospect of a couple of bad quarters ahead and an autumn upturn still over the horizon, China ought to be seen in perspective. Let me advance 10 contrarian points; there are more, but such lists should not go on for too long. 1) Yes, growth dropped in the later months of 2008. But the PRC&apos;s economy is still expanding. 2) Yes, exports are falling. But imports are dropping even faster in price and volume, so there have been record trade surpluses this autumn and winter to produce an all-time high of $295bn for the year 3) Yes, China is suffering from the world crisis and there have been outflows of funds. But the PRC&apos;s foreign exchange reserves still jumped by $61bn in December to $1.95tn.  4) Yes, people are worried, and savings have risen. But the last retail sales figures showed a 20% rise year-on-year. 5) Yes, the profits at the 140 biggest state-owned enterprises fell by 26% between 2007 and 2008. But their combined revenue grew by 20% in the first 11 months of last year.  6) Yes, unemployment is at least double the official 4.5% rate. But wages have been rising fast. 7) Yes, a lot of factories making things like shoes and T-shirts and plastic goods have closed down in the manufacturing hubs of Guangdong and Zhejiang. But many of these plants were rooted in the 1980s and needed to go out of business as China moved up the industrial ladder and implemented new labour legislation that shook their sweatshop model. 8) Yes, the increase in the demand for energy, usually a good indicator of economic activity, has slowed down dramatically. But more stringent times may push enterprises into eliminating their wasteful use of inputs as part of a broader move towards the greater efficiencies the country needs, particularly if electricity price controls are lifted.  9) Yes, China is pump-priming with its programme of subsidies and new infrastructure spending (say 1tn yuan (\u00a3100bn)). But which government is not doing the same? The latest figures show that banks are actually shelling out the money to companies as annual loan growth rose to 18.8% in December, and the broad M2 money supply rose by 17.8%, which is a huge increase given the big fall in inflation in the second half of 2008.  10) Yes, there is discontent among workers who have been laid off and may not return to urban jobs after the lunar New Year holiday and yes, there is already rural over-employment and many returning migrants lack farming skills. But it is interesting to note that reports of grassroots protests repeatedly cite just a couple of outbreaks of violence in Guangdong in which the authorities moved swiftly to placate the demonstrators. This is not to underestimate the difficulties now hitting the People&apos;s Republic, nor the prospect that, even if the present policies do bear out the prime minister&apos;s optimism, there will be another downturn around the end of the year lasting into 2010. The current indicators are, for the most part, pointing downwards. The economy and society are much more complex than at the time of the last big decline, at the end of the 1990s, and the central government&apos;s ability to turn the ship round is that much more debatable. China&apos;s progress since 1978 has been a volatile process in which, despite its insistence on one-party rule, the leadership has had to cede much of the control imposed by Mao Zedong. But for the party leader, Hu Jintao, and his colleagues, the stakes are even higher than for leaders in other countries. The Communist party and the regime it runs draw most of their legitimacy from economic growth and social stability. That means they have to throw everything they have got at the current economic problem. A catastrophic slump would not only endanger their positions but would also bring into question the form of regime that has ruled since 1978.  China&apos;s prospects need to be seen in that wider context. The country may have more going for it than the present doomsayers suggest, but it is facing a survival test of a kind not known in the west. The stakes are so high \u2013 and the importance of China to the world so great \u2013 that they should not be subject to simplification through a Manichaean lens."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jan/18/mervyn-davies-trade-minister", "publicationDate": "2009-01-18T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Business", "Standard Chartered", "Politics", "Mervyn Davies"], "sentences": ["Intelligent, open-minded and energetic, the Welsh-speaking son of a Midland bank manger from Colwyn Bay, Davies turned Standard Chartered into a powerful international bank, buying businesses in Taiwan, Korea and entering China.", "A former non-exec at Tesco, his involvement came at a crucial time, when the retail juggernaut was about to embark on a global expansion trail that has seen it enter China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Europe and the US."], "title": "Mervyn Davies is that rare breed: a banker that people like", "article": "Such is the low esteem Britain&apos;s financial kingpins enjoy these days that a clothing item increasingly spotted on Britain&apos;s high streets is a T-shirt with the word &quot;Banker&quot; customised so that the &quot;b&quot; is replaced with a &quot;w&quot;. It is, however, a sentiment that few, if any, would express about 57-year-old Mervyn Davies, who last week resigned as chairman of Standard Chartered to accept Gordon Brown&apos;s offer to become Britain&apos;s trade and investment minister - a job he will undertake free of charge. The pursuit of money has not been the prime motivation of his whirlwind career. What drives the small, wiry and passionate Welsh rugby man - he is ideal scrum-half material - appears to be a complicated cocktail involving the accumulation of knowledge, the challenge of leadership, the embracing of change and coming out on top. So far, life seems to have delivered for him in spades. Davies&apos;s appointment was sealed last Sunday at Chequers, when the prime minister invited the UK&apos;s most powerful money-men for lunch to work on a major restructuring of Britain&apos;s banks, details of which are expected this week.  Davies played a backroom role in structuring the government&apos;s original \u00a3500bn package to rescue British banks last October and will continue working in this area in his new role. He was considered as a possible chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland, though friends say a political role will play to his strengths. The new minister&apos;s long-term goal will be to forge links with powerful, state-run sovereign wealth funds to ensure the UK is at the heart of their investment decisions, and enhance broader trade links with emerging economies. He will also work with Lord Myners, the minister responsible for financial services, to repair the City&apos;s battered reputation. Intelligent, open-minded and energetic, the Welsh-speaking son of a Midland bank manger from Colwyn Bay, Davies turned Standard Chartered into a powerful international bank, buying businesses in Taiwan, Korea and entering China. His stint in Hong Kong heading Standard Chartered&apos;s Asian operations during the mid-90s was the single most important landmark in his development. Friends say it opened his eyes and immersed him in new cultures; the entire Davies family moved with him.  He became a media star in Hong Kong, regularly on Chinese and Thai television during the Asian currency crisis of the late 90s as chairman of the Hong Kong banking association. He lapped up the attention and his assured performances made him a natural to take charge of Standard after a boardroom coup cleared a path for him in 2001. &quot;I&apos;ve become a true international &apos;nut&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;The more that the youngsters of today are exposed to the rest of the world, the more they will grow and succeed.&quot; Davies leaves behind a bank that most analysts say is well placed to emerge from the crisis intact and enhanced. And there is little doubt that the art- and antique-collecting Tottenham fan - his new government role means he has had to resign from the board of the north London club - can afford a couple of years without a monthly pay packet. In fact, Davies is a rare creature in the City - a human banker known for his wit, culture and charm. His life is a succession of dinners, meetings and airport departure lounges. Car journeys are chauffeured; during them, Davies will be texting, studying his BlackBerry and listening to opera on his iPod.  He is a man well known to the leaders of India and China and regularly wines and dines with global chief executives. &apos;One of the best ways of improving your own performance as a chief executive is to find out what other people are doing well,&apos; he says. A former non-exec at Tesco, his involvement came at a crucial time, when the retail juggernaut was about to embark on a global expansion trail that has seen it enter China, Korea, Taiwan, eastern Europe and the US. For all his charm, those who know him say he has an ambitious, steely core. He is hard to please, but has the happy knack of motivating others. His belief in diversity means his management teams are not stuffed with &quot;yes men&quot;. Though his executive board at Standard Chartered is uniformly male and middle aged, there are two women non-executives, and key operatives come from all backgrounds.  It will be fascinating to see what Davies makes of the bureaucratic permafrost at Whitehall, as described by his predecessor as trade minister, the voluble former CBI boss Lord Jones, last week. Jones said his time in politics had been &quot;one of the most dehumanising and depersonalising experiences a human being can have&quot;, adding &quot;the whole system is designed to take the personality, the drive and the initiative out of a junior minister&quot;.  Davies is just the latest recruit from business into Brown&apos;s inner sanctum. Whether he will be the man to break out of the straitjacket, only time will tell. But of all Brown&apos;s recent recruits, you suspect Davies has the best chance of bending civil servants to his will, rather than the other way around."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jan/22/computing-microsoft", "publicationDate": "2009-01-22T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Computing", "Microsoft", "Technology", "Education", "IT for schools", "Schools", "Intel"], "sentences": ["CMS tells me it&apos;s making its Classmate PC, the Fizzbook Bang, in Liverpool, but will source the convertible Fizzbook Spin from Taiwan until sales volumes increase."], "title": "Jack Schofield: World's schoolchildren to get a new Classmate", "article": "Intel unveiled its Classmate 2 reference design at last week&apos;s Bett education exhibition at Olympia in London, with the aim of bringing a convertible tablet PC to millions of schoolchildren across the globe. It works as a normal laptop PC, but you can swivel the screen round and fold it over the keyboard, which turns it into a touch-screen tablet PC. Children can then draw on the screen, or use it for handwriting recognition. We&apos;ve had convertible PCs for more than a decade, of course, but few people use them. Will that change? Possibly. The Classmate 2 is a cheap, durable, child-sized PC based on Intel&apos;s Atom netbook chipset and, like the original Classmate, it could tap a previously unexploited market. At Bett, Intel&apos;s European vice-president, Gordon Graylish, told me: &quot;We now have over 40 companies developing the original Classmate, nine companies have started building the convertible, and there are 30 companies in 40 countries developing software as part of the Intel Learning Series Alliance.&quot; The software bundle includes the Smart Classroom Suite, from the leading interactive whiteboard company. &quot;It&apos;s not about the device,&quot; says Graylish, &quot;it&apos;s about supporting the local language, the local culture, and local manufacturers who understand how the [education] system works. It&apos;s about getting the right software environment, and making sure teachers are trained. The last thing we want is computers sitting in closets.&quot; Intel reckons Classmate 2 convertibles are being produced by CTL and others in the US, by NEC in France, ASI in Australia, Hanvon in China, and the UK&apos;s CMS. CMS tells me it&apos;s making its Classmate PC, the Fizzbook Bang, in Liverpool, but will source the convertible Fizzbook Spin from Taiwan until sales volumes increase. Zoostorm sells the Fizzbook Bang via Amazon, Argos, Littlewoods and other outlets, so Classmate PCs are not limited to educational buyers (fizzbook.com). Graylish says that more than 1m Classmate PCs have now been shipped, counting all the brands. These will continue to be sold alongside the new convertible, and alongside the growing number of netbooks based on the same technology. Also, Portugal has ordered half a million Magellan, or &quot;Magalh\u00e3es&quot;, Classmates, with Venezuela opting for 1m of the same design. This version - designed by Ceiia and built by JP S\u00e1 Couto - will have a larger screen and 3G and/or WiMax connectivity. One of the annoying things about Classmate PCs is that, while they are available with Windows or Linux, Microsoft&apos;s ultra-cheap deal is only for XP Home. This lacks the tablet PC features found in XP Pro. Intel says you can use its ILS suite instead, while CMS points out that schools and local education authorities with Windows site licences can upgrade to Pro for a trivial sum. But people who don&apos;t have site licences will have to pay a silly price for XP Pro to get features that should be part of the operating system. One of the unknowns is whether Microsoft will offer a cheap deal on Windows 7, which works well on an Atom-powered netbook with 1GB of memory (I&apos;ve tried it on a Dell Vostro netbook, like the Mini 9). Microsoft slashed the price of XP Home so as not to lose too much of the netbook market to Linux, and this has had an impact on its profits. Either way, Microsoft can&apos;t charge as much for Windows on a \u00a3250 netbook as it did on a \u00a32,000 desktop.

Until a few weeks ago, the effort seemed worth it. By preventing all this waste going to landfill, we were saving the planet. Then the news broke that in China, where up to a third of Britain&apos;s recyclables end up, the industry had collapsed. In the economic downturn, demand for plastic bottles and other goods made from consumer waste had plummeted, leading to a drop in market prices - from \u00a3200 per tonne of mixed plastics to virtually zero in the space of four weeks. This month, official media in China reported that four-fifths of the country&apos;s recycling units had closed and millions of people would lose their jobs. As a result, thousands of tonnes of plastic were accumulating not just in China, but at council depots throughout Britain. Gloomily, I embarked on a mission to find out whether this was true. If it was, there would be evidence of stockpiling. If not, I wanted to know how much of my recycling was still going to China only to be landfilled there. In fact, of the 12 items in my box, eight were ending their journey in Britain, one in Europe, one in India and only two in the Far East. Of the latter, one was a plastic carrier bag that should not strictly have been collected anyway.  It was a rosier picture than expected - due largely to the way in which Hackney, the London borough where I live, collects its waste. Its vehicles are divided into compartments so materials are kept separate: green bottles in one cage, brown bottles in another, the cardboard Weetabix packs and plastic milk bottles segregated so they fetch a higher price. These, I now know, are called &quot;stillage vehicles&quot; - and the method of collection is &quot;kerbside sorting&quot;, where householder and operative work together to keep items distinct and free from contamination. At the May Gurney depot in Edmonton, north London, where the vehicles go next, I see these items piled in bays 10ft high, sorted further by hand and collected by lorries that take them away for reprocessing. There is no sign of a build-up of materials and the vehicles are leaving fairly regularly, so the contents of my box is clearly going somewhere. The compacting of plastic bottles into mixed bales is the only automation that occurs on site. Behind the vast hangar, I am shown the stinking hopper where food waste is tipped twice a day - the contents of the blue plastic &quot;caddies&quot; collected from doorsteps by the same stillage vehicles. This mouldering mash is mixed with garden waste at a site just across the road, superheated in an industrial composter and spread on the borough&apos;s parks. The cheaper alternative is &quot;commingled&quot; recycling, where householders put everything except food into one plastic sack or bin which is hurled into a lorry and taken to a MRF (pronounced &quot;murf&quot;), or Materials Recovery Facility, where robotic technology separates recoverable items by size, weight and type. The most sophisticated plants can even distinguish clear PET (polyethylene terephthalate) from opaque HDPE (high-density polyethylene), the two types of polymer from which 99 per cent of all plastic bottles are made. &quot;You&apos;ll see laser eyelets that detect the different types of plastic, air jets to direct them into different waste streams, and human operatives doing the same kind of sorting by eye,&quot; says Mike Webster, of the environmental charity Waste Watch. &quot;There are magnets to pick up steel cans, eddy current separators to flick off aluminium, and trommels [revolving drums] to remove different grades of paper.&quot; It&apos;s a Wallace and Gromit world - but not a solution favoured by Hackney Council. &quot;We, as a collection authority, pay more to maintain the quality of the recyclables,&quot; says councillor Alan Laing. &quot;If you throw everything into one sack, and all those sacks are then thrown into the back of a rubbish truck, you have significant levels of contamination.&quot; A council will never make money from selling recyclables, he emphasises; all it can hope to do is offset the cost of collection - and higher prices are associated with kerbside sorting. There is also an ethical consideration. This method, Laing and his colleagues believe, offers &quot;the best chance of genuine recycling. We have satisfied ourselves, as much as we can, that these materials aren&apos;t just going somewhere else in the world to be landfilled.&quot; That is not to say Hackney collects no commingled waste at all. About 50 per cent of its housing stock is on estates where there are no kerbside collections, and lack of space means one recycling hopper has to suffice for cardboard, mixed glass, plastic bottles, tins and cans. Only paper merits its own bin, because paper is worthless to recyclers if it gets mixed up with broken glass. In these straitened times, more councils are saving money by switching to commingled collection. &quot;The quality of material coming in is declining,&quot; says Martin Atkinson of Aylesford Newsprint in Kent, which turns waste paper, including Hackney&apos;s, into newspaper. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter to some councils whether the material gets incinerated - which is legitimate, in that it is turning waste into energy - or whether it is returned to its former state. There has been a push for councils just to get their tonnages up and collect it all together. The householder thinks it is going to be recycled, but that is often not the case. Over the past few years, there has been a big move towards commingling, which has had a detrimental effect.&quot; Philip Tutt, a spokesman for the O-I Group, which turns glass from Hackney back into bottles at its plant in Harlow, Essex, agrees. &quot;As long as glass is delivered to us in three separate colours - green, clear and brown - we can use it,&quot; he says. With commingled, the colours get mixed up. &quot;If it&apos;s a mixed load, it can&apos;t be remanufactured into brown glass,&quot; says Tutt. &quot;If it&apos;s contaminated by other materials, that is a problem for us. It will then get sold off for another final use, whether it is road aggregate, roof lagging or something else. It&apos;s not true recycling, and that&apos;s down to the local authority.&quot; What&apos;s more, poor-quality recyclables are more likely to be shipped abroad - particularly to the Far East where, until the crash, manufacturers clamoured for our waste no matter how contaminated it was. In 2007, it emerged that in the London Borough of Camden (which had opted for commingled collection in a bid to cut costs), 90 per cent of newspapers and pamphlets collected from boxes was being sent to Indonesia and 10 per cent to Malaysia, while 80 per cent of paper was going to India and the remaining 20 per cent to China. &quot;The issue is one of quality,&quot; says Stuart Foster of Recoup, an independent advisory body for plastics recycling. &quot;If you try to sell rubbish into the recycling market, you won&apos;t get very much money for it - but China will accept a lower quality, generally, than UK processors. Those [councils] that didn&apos;t pay attention to quality when the going was good, that were half-hearted in the way they separated material, are the ones that have been caught out.&quot;  In those boroughs, mountains of paper, cans and baled plastic bottles will be building up - but householders should not give up on recycling. &quot;There is still demand for material,&quot; Foster insists. &quot;Companies are trading, material is moving and plastic is fetching from \u00a340 to \u00a3100 a tonne.&quot; The solution, he says, is for councils to re-sort their plastic, removing paper and debris, to make it more acceptable to UK reprocessors. In six months, Foster reckons, recyclers in Britain will have developed the capacity to deal with the surplus. In my quest to find out where the food packaging in my box goes, I discovered that the cleaner, kerbside-sorted variety not only fetches higher prices but is processed closer to home. Indeed, if you look at the London Borough of Hackney website, the recipients of my box contents are listed quite transparently: paper bags and wrappers go to Aylesford Newsprint in Kent, 33 miles away, for instance, while my riesling bottles are made back into wine bottles by the O-I Group in Harlow, Essex, just 22 miles from my front door. There is no mention of anything going abroad, yet my own analysis shows the items in my box could, between them, travel 17,260 miles - and that is excluding some legs of what is a fairly circuitous journey. Only two items are likely to go to China or Taiwan, but the distances are still shocking. My aim was to look at how far the items have to travel before they are turned back into something useful: a sack of plastic flakes made from bottles doesn&apos;t count, but a fleece jacket made from that plastic does. Hackney, by comparison, follows progress only as far as the initial processor - and has no legal duty to track where they go after that. In time, I spoke to every single recipient of every type of recyclable from my kitchen, asking where it might feasibly be sold and, in most cases, where it might be sold on next. Some travelled huge distances (not just to China, but to India and Taiwan), others shorter distances (Cheshire, Kent) only to be landfilled or incinerated there. Some, which should never have been collected anyway, were likely to be incinerated a few miles from my home - joining the estimated 200,000 tonnes of &quot;recycling&quot; (about two per cent of the total) that gets burnt or sent to landfill by UK councils every year, according to a survey published last month. The worst offenders, Medway and Peterborough councils, sent 11 per cent of recyclable waste to landfill sites or incinerators. Hackney, by comparison, is an exemplary borough trying to do the right thing. What did councillor Laing have to say about my well-travelled box contents? &quot;We are part of a global market when it comes to recyclates,&quot; he admits, &quot;so inevitably some will end up going abroad where there is a demand for those sorts of materials.&quot; He finds an unexpected ally in Waste Watch, which points out that recyclables ending up in China isn&apos;t the environmental crime that many critics believe it is. &quot;Where do all our plastic goods come from?&quot; Mike Webster asks, rhetorically. &quot;They come from China - so that is where the demand will be. Ships bring plastic goods here, and they would just be going back full of water ballast if we didn&apos;t fill them with our discarded plastic - which actually makes it carbon-neutral. We would much prefer to see all of it dealt with at home, where it keeps the UK economy going, has a smaller footprint and where you can keep a better eye on what is happening to it. But if that isn&apos;t happening, I would rather have it recycled in China than landfilled here.&quot; Before the Chinese collapse, says Stuart Foster of Recoup, between half and two-thirds of plastic bottles collected in Britain were ending up in China - down from 75 per cent in 2006. That improvement is due largely to the opening of the Closed Loop London plant in Dagenham, capable of turning 35,000 tonnes of used bottles back into food-grade plastic per year. That facility cost \u00a313m to develop, and a further \u00a38m and \u00a310m respectively have been invested in hi-tech plastic recycling plants in Derbyshire and Lincolnshire. Within two years, Foster believes these plants will be capable of recycling the vast majority of the 180,000 tonnes of plastic bottles collected in Britain every year: &quot;Chinese markets, if they recover, should be the backstop only.&quot;  So the race is on for Britain to recycle more of its own waste independently of China. &quot;If we don&apos;t meet our targets,&quot; councillor Laing explains, &quot;we will end up with more going to landfill and incineration - and that brings additional cost to us.&quot; Under UK law, councils pay \u00a340 for every tonne of rubbish sent to landfill. &quot;It is a cost timebomb,&quot; Laing points out. &quot;We are facing, over the next 20 years, a bill that is the equivalent of shutting down social services because of landfill tax. We all have to carry on recycling.&quot;  \u2022 Read more on recycling from Andrew Purvis at Word of Mouth, observer.co.uk/foodblog Opaque plastic bottle (HDPE) Travels 168 milesDestination: Runcorn, Cheshire Opaque bottles made from HDPE are sent by road to JFC Delleve in Runcorn, in mixed bales with clear and coloured PET bottles. An optical sorter uses lasers to identify the different plastic types and separate them using air jets. On site, HDPE is made into drainage pipe for agriculture and construction. Upside: The pipe is all sold in Britain, cutting transport costs and emissions. Squeezable bottle Travels 180 milesDestination: landfill, Merseyside &quot;There&apos;s a barrier layer inside this plastic bottle,&quot; says Andy Bagnall at JFC Delleve. The outside is polypropylene, which the lasers will allow through, but its composite construction is a problem. &quot;It would probably be ejected in the final sort, then baled up with the other rigid plastics such as yoghurt pots and margarine tubs, which are landfilled or sometimes re-sorted in the Midlands.&quot; Upside: Nearly 99 per cent of plastic bottles collected are HDPE or PET. Clear plastic bottles Travels 335 milesDestination: Lisburn, Northern Ireland Clear or blue-tinted PET is separated from the mixed bales arriving at JFC, where it is made into high-grade PET flakes. These are sold on to recyclers (&quot;most likely in Britain&quot;, though JFC would not say exactly where), then to manufacturers of, say, food packaging. &quot;A tray might be virgin PET where it touches meat,&quot; says JFC, &quot;and recycled PET on the outside.&quot; Upside: Clear plastic goes almost full circle: a bottle made into a food tray. Cardboard/cereal boxes Travels 64 milesDestination: Fordham, Cambridgeshire Cardboard is taken to Kemsley in Kent, where it is pulped at the St Regis mill. Staples, plastic and glue are removed and the pulp is turned into corrugated case material (CCM): ridged cardboard between two layers of paper. Reels of it are taken by lorry to a factory such as Fordham, near Newmarket. The board is cut into panels, tinted and made into boxes. Upside: Within 14 days, recycled cardboard can be back in service as a box. Squeezable plastic (PET) Travels 100 milesDestination: the Midlands This is made from the same PET material as clear drinks bottles. It would be made into high-grade flakes by JFC in Runcorn, then sold on to a recycler, perhaps ending up as palette strap (used to bind heavy loads on lorries) or food packaging film made by a company in, say, the Midlands. Upside: This squeezable bootle is 100 per cent recyclable. Coloured plastic bottle (PET) Travels 6,082 milesDestination: Taipei, Taiwan Most drinks bottles are made from PET - and where the recycled flakes end up depends on how pure, clean and colour-free the reprocessor can get them. Coloured bottles like these are low-grade and used to make fibre for fleeces or jackets. &quot;They could end up anywhere,&quot; says Michael Flynn of JFC Delleve. &quot;Fibre production for clothing is based abroad, in lower labour-cost markets.&quot; Upside: JFC says all the plastic it sells abroad is recycled, never landfilled. Plastic carrier bag Travels 5,059 milesDestination: Beijing, China Householders put recyclables in plastic bags -but officially, Hackney does not take them. For every 40 bales of plastic bottles sent to JFC, the contractor (May Gurney) is allowed to send one bale of bags. This is low-grade recyclate and almost worthless, so it will most likely be &quot;shunted to the Far East&quot;, says Doug Teesdale of May Gurney. The rest will be incinerated virtually next door. Upside: All waste burnt at Edmonton provides electricity for the National Grid. Tetra packs Travels 46 milesIncinerator, Kemsley, Kent The bane of recyclers, Tetra Paks contain cardboard, metal foil and plastic. Hackney does not collect them (though they can be taken to recycling banks) but some slip through as cardboard which is pulped at Kemsley. Paper fibres are recovered, while the plastic and foil are removed and incinerated on site. Upside: Tetra Pak has pledged to provide five collection points in every UK borough - and to transport the troublesome cartons to Sweden for recycling. Aluminium Travels 164 milesDestination: Warrington, Cheshire A mix of cans, tins and trays is taken by lorry to AMG in Llanelli, Wales, where it is shredded to make &quot;a homogenous feed stock&quot;, says Jason Carpenter, director of AMG Resources. The aluminium (mainly drinks cans) is &quot;pinged off&quot; using an electromagnetic current, while paper labels and the plastic liners and tubes from aerosols are removed. The aluminium is crushed into bales and sold exclusively to a company in Warrington, to be made into new cans. Upside: Perfect! A drink can made into a drink can. Steel tins Travels 4,735 milesDestination: Bhilai, India At AMG Llanelli, steel tins are shredded, separated from the mix by magnets, cleansed of paper or plastic and compacted into bales. &quot;The steel is sold back into global steelmaking applications,&quot; says Jason Carpenter - to a steelworks in India, say, to be made into a car component, a car body, a fridge or steel for construction. Other markets include Pakistan, Spain, Turkey and the US. Upside: AMG recovers all the tin coating from cans and uses it again. Glass bottles Travels 22 milesDestination: Harlow, Essex Glass is kept separate in three colours (green, brown and clear) and sent to O-I in Harlow. It is broken into pieces and put in a furnace to turn it back into glass. Brown, green and clear bottles are made on site, then sent to drinks manufacturers. Upside: The purest form of recycling: old bottles made into new bottles."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/2009/jan/28/steven-hill", "publicationDate": "2009-01-28T16:47:00Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["Mr. Hill&apos;s articles, opeds and commentaries have appeared in the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune, Financial Times, Guardian, Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, The Nation, Salon.com, American Prospect, Social Europe Journal, Le Monde Diplomatique, H\u00fcrriyet Daily News (Turkey), Prague Post, Taiwan News, Roll Call, Sierra, Ms. and many other leading publications."], "title": "Full profile", "article": "Steven Hill is a writer, columnist and political professional based in the United States with two decades of experience in politics.

The pictures, which are now on display on the site, show objects as small as 50cm long \u2013 less than an arm&apos;s length. The photos of the huge numbers attending the Obama inauguration are breathtaking. It is fortunate that they are there: a software problem meant GeoEye-1, which went into orbit last October, didn&apos;t go into commercial service until December. In November, the terrorist attacks in Mumbai \u2013 and how they were planned \u2013 shocked the world. Detailed satellite images of the city on Google Earth, sourced from GeoEye&apos;s sister satellite Ikonos, were used. It is a clear example of how easy such intelligence has become to obtain. Satellites of love That&apos;s because satellite photos are a keen new source of commercial competition for a huge range of services. DigitalGlobe is a competitor to GeoEye, supplying 60cm-resolution images to companies such as Google Earth, but much of its funding comes from the US government. Its WorldView-1 satellite will rush out the latest classified terrain images of Afghanistan to American ground troops, or shots of an Australian city centre for a satellite navigation map, in a single day&apos;s orbit. Jill Smith, chief executive of DigitalGlobe, says: &quot;Our satellite constellation has the capacity to collect 1m square kilometres of images of the Earth per day.&quot; However, the US government restricts what is publicly available. &quot;Someone could utilise it for unlawful purposes, but we believe the benefits of access to this imagery far outweigh any potential risk,&quot; says Smith. GeoEye-1 cost $502m (\u00a3357m) to put into service, and shoots at a resolution of 41cm, but the US government restricts the commercial output to a maximum of 50cm. When the next-generation GeoEye-2 satellite launches in 2011 it will take pictures at 25cm resolution, but the same restriction will apply. Subscribers to the service will be able to see individual people, but not their faces. Tim Brown, an analyst at GlobalSecurity.org, has published numerous reports using commercial satellite imagery to detect forced labour camps and missile bases in North Korea. He says: &quot;There are many cases of commercial imagery falling into the wrong hands. China tried to buy sub-metre-scale images of Taiwan but ran into trouble with US government regulations. By going through a supposedly benign environmental monitoring project, they got 60cm-resolution images of the entire island from DigitalGlobe.&quot; Brown says not everyone is able to circumvent the security checks. &quot;North Korean agents tried to purchase imagery of the DMZ [demilitarised zone] a couple of years ago through a dummy company based in Australia, but were caught. There&apos;s a guy in a cubicle somewhere checking all this,&quot; he says. Nonetheless, in 2006 the Islamic army in Iraq circulated an instructional video showing how to use Google Earth to zoom in on buildings such as Iraq&apos;s Rasheed airport. Smith at DigitalGlobe says: &quot;Most people don&apos;t realise this but the images on Google Earth are usually a few years old, they are very low resolution and the GPS co-ordinates are often imprecise. It&apos;s a world apart from the bespoke solutions we sell to our more sophisticated clients.&quot; The CIA launched the first Corona spy satellite in 1959. It was stocked with black-and-white film with an image resolution of 7.5m \u2013 enough to make out cars and buildings, but not people. By the late 60s the resolution of the spy satellites had gone up to 46cm and by the 80s, 15cm. Reports vary on their current capabilities. In the mid-90s the US government changed its laws on commercial satellite-imaging, and the market has since grown briskly. Seven privately run satellites have been launched in a decade, with a further 30 planned for the next 10 years. Business intelligence customers are predominately multinationals in the mining, oil and gas, and insurance sectors. However, the satellite launches have been funded mainly by US and European taxpayers. Our governments have purchased a cheaper intelligence solution and simultaneously brought into being a market for Earth imagery expected to grow to $3bn by 2017. All of the commercial satellite operators are signed up to a UN charter requiring them to supply images to aid disaster-relief efforts. In reality this represents a tiny proportion of their capacity. Mark Brender, vice-president of marketing at GeoEye, says: &quot;The agreement is for between two to three scenes for NGOs every year. Outside of that, commercial entities take precedence.&quot; He adds: &quot;I will happily sell you hi-res pictures of North Korea&apos;s missile bases today for $10 per square kilometre.&quot; Off-the-shelf images are becoming cheaper and even free via online services. But obtaining timely coverage of a particular site at high resolution requires &quot;tasking&quot; a satellite so the camera points in a particular direction over the desired land area. It costs tens of thousands of dollars. Access all areas Brown at GlobalSecurity says: &quot;Motor manufacturers such as Ford cover up their new products to protect against rival companies obtaining imagery. I assume commercial satellite espionage takes place, although you would have to task the satellite for the correct place and time. But it&apos;s increasingly easy to get access.&quot; Lars Bromley, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, produced a series of highly publicised reports on humanitarian crises in Africa using satellite imagery. He uses the images to assess damage to buildings and the movement of refugees. He says commercial interests often prevent aid organisations from getting timely information. &quot;For years, I could not task a particular satellite over Darfur as some other entity had dominated it by paying millions of dollars,&quot; he says. &quot;A couple of weeks ago I managed to get images within 72 hours. Competition has obviously subsided.&quot; Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) is a British company planning to launch a 60cm-resolution satellite in 2011 at the low price of $50m. &quot;The image-cost will be 15p per square kilometre,&quot; says Paul Brooks, SSTL&apos;s business development director. &quot;Timely, precise images will be available for combating deforestation, drought prediction and resource management. It&apos;ll bring transparency benefits to the global economy.&quot; SSTL&apos;s lightweight satellites are helping to fuel a boom in countries that have not previously had their own national imaging capability, with 199 Earth-observation satellite launches planned between now and 2016. NigeriaSat-1 was launched by SSTL in 2003 with a 32-metre resolution. &quot;The first images of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina were from NigeriaSat,&quot; says Brooks. &quot;It was the satellite that was overhead at the time.&quot; Both the British Red Cross and Oxfam say the importance of satellite imaging will grow as the number of extreme events increase over the coming years. Today, such organisations still face problems getting the pictures they need to respond effectively. New satellite launches will hopefully build to a critical mass where the right imagery is easier to obtain and more affordable. &quot;Every technology comes with negatives as well as positives,&quot; says GeoEye&apos;s Brender. &quot;A telephone can be used to co-ordinate a robbery, or to call an ambulance.&quot; In the current market for high-resolution satellite imagery, a bit of both is occurring. Eye spy: a timeline 1959: Corona The CIA launches the first spy satellite with 7.5m resolution. Black-and-white film is returned to Earth in &quot;photo buckets&quot;.  1961: Zenit The Soviet Union launches its own spy satellite with a 10m resolution camera, although unofficial sources claimed it was much better.  1966: KH-7 The US breaches the metre scale with its 46cm resolution spy satellite.  1988: IRS-1A India launches its own colour CCD imaging satellite with a resolution of 36.5m.  1999: Ikonos US launches the first commercial-imaging satellite at 1m digital resolution. Orders delayed from 2001 due to the war in Afghanistan.  2003: NigeriaSat Nigeria&apos;s contribution to the Disaster Monitoring Constellation goes live at 32m resolution. 2008: GeoEye-1 The highest-resolution commercial satellite to date, GeoEye-1 can record images down to 41cm. Publicly available images are restricted to 50cm.

Michelle Obama wearing a dress by Jason Wu at the inaugural ball. Photograph: Jason Reed/Reuters    Have you heard of Jason Wu? You may well be familiar with the name if you were listening to the news last week - he was the virtually unknown designer propelled to fame after making Michelle Obama&apos;s white chiffon dress for the inauguration ball. We may be causing controversy when we say that although we love Michelle, we didn&apos;t think the dress was all that. In fact, we preferred the &quot;geometrical haemorrhage&quot; on a &quot;butcher&apos;s apron&quot; (thanks Germaine Greer) that she wore on election night.  Anyway, who cares what we think about Michelle? It&apos;s actually Wu himself who is the subject of this fashion dilemma. There&apos;s no doubt that the Taiwan-born 26-year-old has upped his profile immeasurably in the last ten days. The inauguration ball was another big step for the designer whose talent had already been recognised by Anna Wintour - she sat front row at his show during New York fashion week in September. However, his career may shortly be on the wane. Last week, in an interview with Fashion Week Daily, these ill-fated words fell from his lips: &quot;I&apos;m doing a significant fur collection, and the message will be all about luxury.&quot; Right away, he&apos;s surely lost his most famous customer - we can&apos;t see the First Lady wanting to wear his &apos;luxury&apos; outfits if it means taking on the likes of Peta, the organisation who lobbied Donna Karan for two years. They even invaded her New York apartment to show graphic images of animals being harvested for their pelts, and bludgeoned stuffed bunnies outside her shows while wearing Karan masks. So what, then, is Wu hoping to achieve? Notoriety? He&apos;ll certainly get this if fur does fly on February 13 but in our opinion it&apos;s a cheap, distasteful stunt that may well end in tears for the fledgling designer. BANG ON TREND Walking canes     A model carries a walking stick at the Alexander McQueen show. Photograph: Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images    We may be wrong but (fingers crossed!) we&apos;re predicting the return of the &apos;Victorian gentleman&apos; look. Remember how the trilby became ubiquitous summer headwear? Well, now it&apos;s the turn of the walking cane, last seen at Alexander McQueen&apos;s menswear show. Forget so-called &apos;investment pieces&apos; (super-expensive accessories that you have to give a special name to justify buying). This is the real deal - a good walking cane will last you a lifetime and they&apos;re inexpensive, too. Team with a long sheepskin coat \u00e0 la McQueen, or a streamlined, narrow-fit suit (steer clear of 80s power shoulders). Think Sweeney Todd without the murdering. You can buy a dress cane for as little as \u00a317 from walkingsticksonline.co.uk, but unless you&apos;re wearing uniform we&apos;d suggest going for something a little more rough and ready. This hazel knob stick costs \u00a323 and looks as if it would feel great in your hand. We also came across the Walking Stick Shop in Arundel, West Sussex, which will make you a cane for just \u00a320 and also stocks a fabulous range of antique models. Alternatively, if you suddenly come over all Ray Mears you could always go and cut your own. It&apos;ll have that authentic rough-hewn appearance - just watch out for splinters. FASHIONISTA OF THE WEEK Kate Winslet     Photograph: Rebecca Sapp/WireImage.com    Forgiven for her recent waterworks, our national treasure, Kate Winslet, has been looking rather ravishing of late. Showcasing her curves in an array of body-con dresses, Kate sticks to black and block colours for a fresh, fierce look. Pictured here at the recent Montecito film awards, Kate looked killer in a black-and-white Narciso Rodriguez wool shift. QUOTE OF THE WEEK &quot;The idea was for it to look like it was having sex with a motorcycle jacket.&quot;  Grazia brings us the best interviews, as usual. This time it&apos;s Lady GaGa discussing a dress made for her by Haus. FASHION GRAVEYARD Roberto Cavalli Roberto Cavalli&apos;s creations should carry a warning: &quot;more money than sense.&quot; Look at poor Nicolette Sheridan trying to make the most of this hideous design.  Cavalli&apos;s signature leopard print, bejewelled necklines, thigh-high slits and halternecks might be acceptable on their own, but combined they&apos;re just plain wrong. Far from being flattering, Roberto&apos;s victims look as though they&apos;ve made their gowns themselves and have run out of material.  The man once said: &quot;We should think more about fantasy.&quot; I agree; we should fantasise about a world without his clothes.

Bush is not around to misinterpret, it is probably safe to point out something climate negotiators rarely mention. There are quite a few countries out there that don&apos;t have targets to cut their carbon dioxide emissions, but who really ought to. They are not poor, and they are not low emitters. They are climate freeloaders. I am not talking about large Asian countries like India or Indonesia or even China, where national emissions may be large but per capita emissions remain very low by rich-world standards. The average Indian is responsible for roughly a tenth the emissions of the average American. Even the average Chinese has emissions only around a quarter those of the average American (as I mentioned in a previous article here), and a good proportion of that is produced while making goods to sell to the West. We, the big emitters, have to engage countries like China and India in taking action, if we are to stave off climate change. But we have to do that from a position of humility \u2014 admitting that, sorry, but we have used up most of the available atmospheric space for greenhouse gases. What I am talking about here, however, is a growing list of rapidly industrializing countries that don&apos;t have targets under the existing Kyoto Protocol, but have emissions rates that are now often above those of many longtime industrialized nations that do have targets. Moreover, while the Kyoto countries are cutting emissions, the non-Kyoto countries are mostly raising them \u2014 and fast. These are places as different as Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and South Korea. None of these countries currently seem likely even to be asked to adopt targets in Copenhagen later this year, when the successor agreement to the 1997 protocol is set to be decided. And that seems increasingly crazy \u2014 not only unfair, but also damaging to any real effort to tackle climate change. When the Kyoto Protocol was signed in 1997, it set targets for industrialized countries, including member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the former Soviet bloc and Japan. But emerging industrial countries were left out, partly through political expediency and partly because their emissions didn&apos;t seem to matter much. Now they do. The trend is revealed in disturbing detail in estimates of national emissions for 2007 recently published by the U.S. government&apos;s Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a widely respected international monitor. Take Malaysia, which for all intents and purposes is now an industrialized country and has carbon dioxide emissions that reflect that \u2014 emissions produced from the energy used to run factories, vehicles, and air-conditioning systems. By 2007 Malaysia had increased its total emissions fourfold since 1990, from 15 million tons of carbon to 68 million tons. (1990 is the base year used for calculating emissions reductions for countries under the Kyoto Protocol.) Malaysia \u2014 which has a GDP greater than many European countries \u2014 now emits slightly more carbon dioxide per capita than Britain, which at 2.47 tons per head is a fairly middle-range European country. But while Britain is on course to meet its Kyoto target of a cut of 12.5 percent from 1990 levels, Malaysia can carry on raising its emissions as much as it likes. U.S. per capita emissions, incidentally, are currently 5.3 tons of carbon, according to Oak Ridge. At the other extreme, those of Bangladesh are 0.08 tons. A host of other Asian countries that we used to call &quot;tiger economies&quot; are in the same situation as Malaysia, and for similar reasons \u2014 they continue to increase their emissions above the levels of Kyoto countries that are trying hard to reduce theirs. Taiwan&apos;s emissions have doubled since 1990. Its per capita emissions are ahead of most of Europe. But it has no targets. Likewise South Korea, which recently nudged above its neighbor Japan in per capita emissions. Yet while Japan has targets, South Korea does not. South Korea has been in the OECD club of rich nations since 1996, but on climate it still conveniently sits with the poor countries. This must be a trifle embarrassing for South Korea&apos;s most famous envoy, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is fast winning a personal reputation on climate change. Unlike his predecessor, Kofi Annan, he regularly turns up at climate negotiations, as he did in talks in Poznan, Poland, in December. In Bali in late 2007, his aggressive intervention saved the process from possible collapse. Perhaps it is time he devoted some energy to getting his home country on board. A second group of countries with soaring emissions are in the Gulf region, where the huge energy demands from desalinating seawater often add to the emissions from industrialization, affluence, and profligate use of all the cheap local oil. This month, Abu Dhabi held a much-heralded world future energy summit. Tony Blair was there. Part of its purpose was to showcase a new &quot;green city&quot; Abu Dhabi is building called Masdar. Well, it&apos;s a badly-needed start. Abu Dhabi is part of the United Arab Emirates, whose emissions have gone from 15 million tons of carbon in 1990 to 37 million tons in 2007. Its per capita emissions are now above those of the United States. Since 1990, Saudi Arabia has doubled emissions, which at 4.5 tons of carbon per head are close to those of the United States. Bahrain, at 7.4 tons per head, is well ahead of the U.S. And Kuwait, which similarly has more than doubled emissions, has a per capita figure double that of the U.S. (Not far away, in Israel, emissions have doubled since 1990 and, per head, are now edging past Britain&apos;s). But the super-performer in the Gulf, the country that should rightly be crowned as the world&apos;s worst carbon criminal, is Qatar. It is small \u2014 occupying a sand spit in the Gulf about the size of Connecticut. But its emissions in 2007 were 16 million tons, compared to 3.3 million tons in 1990. Most of the emissions come from its huge gas extraction industry, which is largely for export. But shared out among its population of 825,000, the emissions come to 19.3 tons of carbon per head, or almost eight times those of Britain, and considerably more than three times those of the U.S. That&apos;s a record \u2014 well, unless you count the U.S. Virgin Islands, which Oak Ridge records show emitted more than 25 tons of carbon per head in 2002, the most recent year for which figures are available. Much of the Virgin Islands&apos; emissions are from one of the world&apos;s largest petroleum refineries. Clearly we have a problem here. To label countries like Qatar and Taiwan as &quot;developing&quot; is a myth. It is certainly true that they have been emitting carbon in substantial amounts for far less time than Europe or North America. But it is increasingly untenable for them to hide at international negotiations with the nations of Africa and poor parts of Asia, piously opposing any emissions cuts for the developing world. Give us a break. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and South Korea and the rest are not poor nations. In any international negotiations, we need fairness in allocating emissions targets. And that, I believe, means allocations based on population size. We might need some separate rules for nations that still have fast-rising populations (though I can&apos;t believe that any country would surreptitiously boost its population to get a few more emissions permits). But long term we should be headed for national entitlements based on population. My favorite formula is called &quot;contraction and convergence,&quot; developed by a splendidly single-minded, violin-playing South African living in London named Aubrey Meyer, and publicized through his NGO, the Global Commons Institute. Under his concept, we would listen to what scientists are saying and contract global emissions so as to stabilize concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But then we would apportion emissions entitlements according to a formula that gradually would converge national targets toward a level based strictly on population. Of course, countries would be free to trade their entitlements \u2013 so the U.S. could buy from India, and so on. But the initial allocations would be transparent and equitable. It would take all the horse-trading out of the international negotiations. I recommend you check out the graphs of how this could happen on Meyer&apos;s web site \u2014 especially if you work for the Obama team that is deciding how to approach climate change negotiations this year. Like me you may be left wondering why the world didn&apos;t adopt this simple formula long ago. In London this week, the UN&apos;s chief climate diplomat, Yvo de Boer, said he thought that &quot;in the long run,&quot; emissions targets based on population were the way to go. So why not now? My proposal for Copenhagen is that governments grab the chance to think afresh on climate, and adopt this long-term solution that does away with the ridiculous anomalies that currently exist. \u2022 This article was shared by our content partner Yale Environment 360, part of the Guardian Environment Network"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/02/india-computer-cheapest", "publicationDate": "2009-02-02T16:37:00Z", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Technology", "Computing", "Credit crunch"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s Eee PC costs as little as $200."], "title": "India to launch credit crunch \u00a37 laptop, world's cheapest computer", "article": "The credit crunch computer is set to arrive tomorrow in India when officials unveil the 500 rupee (\u00a37.25) laptop. In an attempt to bridge the &quot;digital divide&quot; in the country between rich and poor, the government will show off the prototype, low-cost laptop as the centrepiece of an ambitious e-learning programme to link 18,000 colleges and 400 universities across the country. India has a reputation for creating ultra-cheap technologies, a trend sparked last year by the Tata Nano, the world&apos;s cheapest car at Rs100,000 (\u00a31,450). The computer, known as Sakshat, which translates as &quot;before your eyes&quot;, will be launched as part of a new Rs46bn &quot;national mission for education&quot;. This envisages a network of laptops from which students can access lectures, coursework and specialist help from anywhere in India, triggering a revolution in education. A number of publishers have reportedly agreed to upload portions of their textbooks on to the system. Prabhakar Rao, vice-chancellor of the university in Andhra Pradesh from where the Sakshat will be launched, said that India was &quot;looking to get the hardware and software cheaper. In a developing country, costs have to be kept low so that the maximum number of students will benefit. That means cheap computers and cheap broadband access, so that students get access to ebooks and ejournals.&quot; Although half of India&apos;s 1 billion people are aged below 25, the country has fallen behind in terms of university places, with only 11% of students enrolled, compared with double that in China. India&apos;s bigger northern neighbour already has 180 million internet users, five times India&apos;s total. Designed by scientists at the Vellore Institute of Technology, the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, the Indian Institute of Technology in Madras and the state-controlled Semiconductor Complex, the laptop has 2Gb of Ram and wireless connectivity. In an attempt to keep costs low, experts say it is unlikely to use familiar Microsoft Windows software. Officials are confident that the Rs500 price tag can be met. RP Agarwal, the top civil servant for Indian higher education, told newspapers last week that &quot;at this stage, the price is working out to be $20 [Rs1,000] but with mass production it is bound to come down.&quot; The Indian machine would also be considerably cheaper than the &quot;$100 laptop&quot;, the lime-green computer known as the Children&apos;s Machine or XO that was designed by scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. Launched in 2005 in a flurry of praise by Nicholas Negroponte, the former director of MIT&apos;s Media Lab, the XO has failed to take off, partly because it costs $200 (\u00a3141) to make. However it has given rise to low-cost computers that save money by getting rid of hard drives and using cheap screens. The Classmate PC made by Intel, the world&apos;s biggest microchip manufacturer, can be bought for $400. Taiwan&apos;s Eee PC costs as little as $200. However, some experts doubt that a laptop at $20 or $10 is commercially sustainable. Rajesh Jain, managing director of Netcore Solutions and a pioneer of low-cost computing in India, said: &quot;You cannot even [make] a computer screen for $20. And India does not build much computer hardware. So where will the savings come from?&quot; Some bloggers today saw the new laptop as nothing more than a &quot;souped up calculator&quot;. The scepticism was summed up by Atanu Dey, whose blog read: &quot;If the government could pull-off a near-impossible technological miracle, does it not imply that the entire global computer industry is either totally incompetent or else it is a huge scam which produces stuff at very little cost and sells them at exorbitant prices.&quot; Officials have been reluctant to talk about the project ahead of the launch, however, one did say that costs have been kept low by using students and researchers to do much of the designing. He said that in 2007 the cost was $47, but further refinements meant it dropped dramatically.

The backlash against globalisation has prompted fears that the world stands on the brink of a new protectionist era. French trade unionists have a long tradition of defending their living standards against what they see as unfair competition from countries that frown upon organised labour. The protests in Britain over the past few days suggest that the willingness to take industrial action has spread in the face of rising unemployment and what threatens to be the deepest recession since the second world war. Policymakers are clearly alarmed by these developments. Gordon Brown, while expressing sympathy with UK workers worried about having their pay and conditions undercut by cheaper foreign workers, has insisted that there must be no retreat from open markets. There was a warning from Brussels yesterday that any special treatment from the White House for American steel and manufacturing companies would prompt retaliatory action. The director-general of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, said last week that failure to finish the Doha round of trade negotiations would risk a new era of protectionism. The argument in favour of free trade is that it allows countries to specialise in what they are good at. This leads to greater efficiency, lower prices, higher levels of growth and more jobs. Countries that shut themselves off from the global economy - North Korea, for example - are much poorer than those, such as South Korea, that open their markets. As a result, it is universally accepted in the world of economics that the worst thing that could befall the global economy in its current parlous state would be the sort of tit-for-tat trade war that marked the 1930s. The historical evidence is conclusive: free trade is good, protectionism is bad. Except that isn&apos;t what the evidence actually shows. The Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang has demonstrated that no country since the dawning of the modern age has managed to industrialise successfully without protectionism. During the first century of the industrial revolution, Britain was one of the world&apos;s most protectionist countries and only converted to free trade in the middle of the 19th century. The US had a 40% manufacturing tariff in its period of rapid expansion at the end of the 19th century. All the postwar Asian tigers - Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China - have deployed protectionist measures to defend their fledgling industries. Nor is the lesson of the 1930s quite as clear cut as the free trade camp argues. The US Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 is blamed for turning the Wall Street crash of 1929 into capitalism&apos;s worst-ever depression - up until now, at least - but the American Paul Krugman has shown that this was a statistical impossibility, and that the immense contraction in the economy between 1929 and 1932 could not have been the result of higher tariffs. Instead, it was the result of a contraction in credit associated with policy errors by the Federal Reserve and the collapse of thousands of banks. The real lesson of the 1930s is that if you think protectionism is in the offing, it makes sense to raise your barriers first. Lord Skidelsky, the biographer of Keynes, says that Britain&apos;s economic recovery from the Great Depression was based on three policies - devaluation, cheap money and protectionism. London created a system of &quot;imperial preference&quot; - free trade within the empire but barriers to trade with the rest of the world. Other countries followed suit, abandoning the gold standard so they could devalue and increasing tariffs, and this contributed to the collapse in trade and the prolongation of the slump. Yet the data shows that Britain had one of the shallowest downturns of all the major industrial nations in the 1930s - a 5% fall in GDP. By contrast, Brown&apos;s devotion to free trade and open markets sits uneasily with Britain&apos;s massive - and growing - trade deficit. Policymakers today say that the problem with free trade is that the winners often fail to recognise the benefits they are getting from lower prices, while the losers are all too aware when the job they were doing is lost to a textile mill on the other side of the world. The downturn has made not just the actual losers - but millions of potential losers - painfully aware of their vulnerability."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/feb/06/china-useconomicgrowth", "publicationDate": "2009-02-06T17:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "US economic growth and recession", "Obama administration", "WTO", "US economy", "World news", "US news", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Chang shows that Japan, South Korea and Taiwan went on to adapt such policies in the second half of the 20th century, leading those nations to prosperity by the century&apos;s end."], "title": "Kevin Gallagher: China is a model for recharging the US economy", "article": "This January the outgoing Bush Administration filed yet another suit at the World Trade Organization (WTO) against China&apos;s trade and industrial policies. In its first 10 days, the Obama administration came close to charging the Chinese with currency manipulation. Rather than trying to beat back the Chinese growth miracle, the US should look to the Chinese for guidance on how to recharge our economy. In his new book, Bad Samaritans: The Myth of Free Trade and the Secret History of Capitalism, Cambridge university economist Ha-Joon Chang writes that the US didn&apos;t slacken support for industry until after the US became a dominant industrial power. Readers will be intrigued to learn that in 1791 it was none other than US Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton who wrote an influential report calling for policy to shield US firms from foreigners in order to build national companies. Though solidified later by Abraham Lincoln, writes Chang, Hamilton charted the course of US economic policy until the end of the second world war. Chang shows that Japan, South Korea and Taiwan went on to adapt such policies in the second half of the 20th century, leading those nations to prosperity by the century&apos;s end. China&apos;s growth miracle eclipses all those before it. It is the result of strategic trade and industrial policies largely borrowed from the policies in the US and other East Asian nations that Chang describes. The Chinese have put enormous support into strategic industries such as textiles, high technology and cars, as well as into research and development, and science and technology development. This orchestration of government policy has brought China from the hundredth most competitive high technology export economy to number one in just 25 years. Thanks to these policies, Lenovo, Haier and other Chinese firms are household names. Soon, you could be driving a car from China&apos;s First Auto Works. Following a WTO suit where the US successfully challenged a Chinese programme for car makers, in January the US challenged China&apos;s &quot;famous brands&quot; programme that fosters Chinese firms into becoming globally-recognised names.  The US has to stop blaming the Chinese for its problems and learn from the Chinese what the Chinese learned from us. As part of the US plan to get out of the slump, the US needs to revive industrial and innovation policies toward strategic industries and work to make our products more competitive.  At this writing, the proposed stimulus in the US amounts to 6% of GDP, with just 10% of the proposed $825bn going toward public infrastructure and technology development. China, which was not hit as hard by the US crisis, is spending 14% of GDP (or $585bn) on a stimulus, the majority of which will go toward infrastructure and technology. Learning from the Chinese by reviving strategic industrial and trade policy will also help end the deadlock in the never-ending WTO negotiations. One of the reasons why WTO talks have been stalled has been that the Bush administration wanted the negotiations to put an end to the strategic trade and industrial policy still permitted under the WTO. China, India, South Africa, Brazil and other emerging nations who have been successfully deploying such policies, saw US intransigence as complete hypocrisy and have halted the talks. A good place to start building productive capacity in the US is in green technologies like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and clean cars. According to a new report by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts titled Green Recovery: A Programme to Create Good Jobs and Start Building a Low-Carbon Economy, close to 17 jobs could be created for every $1m in green industry outlays (as opposed to 5.5 jobs per $1m in spending for the oil and coal industries). Thus, $100bn in green recovery outlays would not only stimulate the economy, revive industry, help slash pollution, and decrease our dependence on foreign oil, but would also create 1.7 million jobs. The Obama Administration should drop the Bush-era suit against China at the WTO and back off from calling China a currency manipulator, at least for now. All countries need all they policy space they can muster to get their economies back on track in the midst of the crisis, especially the US. Like the Chinese we should focus on boosting domestic demand and reviving our industry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/feb/05/philippines-barackobama", "publicationDate": "2009-02-08T11:00:00Z", "tags": ["Philippines", "Barack Obama", "US news", "World news"], "sentences": ["Media reports indicate, for example, that nearly 25,000 US marines, soldiers, family members and civilian employees are to descend on the tiny island of Guam in the next five years to ease the over-concentration of US forces on the Japanese island of Okinawa without pulling back too far from the flashpoints of Taiwan and North Korea."], "title": "Fidel Ramos: Asia-Pacific leaders need Barack Obama as a good neighbour", "article": "Unlike his predecessor, President Barack Obama is popular from the Atlantic to the Pacific. He has reached out to the Muslim world and pledged to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without delay. The nations of Asia have a particular affection for him, owing to the years he spent as a child in Indonesia.  If Obama improves America&apos;s global standing with support from political heavyweights such as the vice-president, Joe Biden, secretary of state Hillary Clinton, defence secretary Bob Gates, national security adviser James Jones (a former Nato supreme commander) and secretary of veterans&apos; affairs Eric Shinseki (a former US army chief), he should be able to ask more from America&apos;s allies, particularly for Nato to send more troops to Afghanistan. He will also be able to push Israel to reinvigorate the derailed Middle East peace process. Although his national security team consists of people who largely supported the war in Iraq, Obama has made it clear that his agenda includes withdrawing troops from that country. International goodwill will probably be the key to his success, if not in re-establishing American hegemony, then at least in making America the &quot;indispensable nation&quot; once more.  Although Obama is likely to give priority in his diplomacy to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he cannot take the Asia-Pacific region&apos;s stability for granted. The sources of uncertainty are many: tension between South and North Korea; anxiety over nuclear proliferation posed by co-operation between North Korea and Iran; managing the rise of China and India; and continued Islamist extremism on the Indian sub-continent, particularly Pakistan, as well as in southeast Asia, where al-Qaida has established a second front through Indonesia&apos;s Jemaah Islamiyah.  Vast changes in America&apos;s presence across the Asia-Pacific region are under way and are likely to continue. So far, none of these changes have unsettled the region. Substantial redeployments of US military forces and assets, triggered by the need for additional troops in Afghanistan and ongoing problems over the US-Japan status-of-forces agreement, are already taking place. Media reports indicate, for example, that nearly 25,000 US marines, soldiers, family members and civilian employees are to descend on the tiny island of Guam in the next five years to ease the over-concentration of US forces on the Japanese island of Okinawa without pulling back too far from the flashpoints of Taiwan and North Korea.  But the future of security in the Pacific should not be left to US decision-makers alone. Regional leaders must now develop their own strategy to transform Asia&apos;s many challenges into opportunities, with Obama playing the role of a &quot;good neighbour&quot; who expects other peoples to help themselves and put their own houses in order before turning to the US for assistance.  The Philippines is in an advantageous position to take advantage of the many diplomatic opportunities that will be generated by Obama&apos;s potential activism in the Pacific. To be sure, the country&apos;s &quot;America&quot; card \u2013 the result of the two countries&apos; longstanding strategic relationship (I myself was educated at West Point and fought alongside US troops in the Korean war) \u2013 must be played carefully and not be taken for granted. But it offers the potential for a relationship of the sort that arises only between countries with deep and many-layered ties.  By strategising &quot;out of the box&quot; and finding ways to link Obama&apos;s Asian agenda with that of their own nations, Philippines President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and other Asian leaders will be able to truly make the Pacific the central focus of the Obama administration&apos;s diplomacy.

Here, Banning Garrett and Jonathan Adams introduce the report. The full document can be downloaded in both languages here. Nearly four decades ago, the 1971-72 US-China rapprochement led to the most far-reaching strategic transformation of the international economic, political and security order since the extraordinary set of relationships and institutions that had been established in the aftermath of World War II. Today, the United States and China have a historic opportunity to once again catalyse a strategic transformation, this time to a global low-carbon, sustainable economy to effectively mitigate the chances of catastrophic climate change while increasing global prosperity. American and Chinese leadership is critical since the two countries are the biggest developed and developing countries, the biggest consumers of energy and the biggest producers of greenhouse-gas emissions. If the US and China do not lead this generations-long effort, it is unlikely that it will occur at all \u2013 or at least not on a timetable that will achieve the global greenhouse-gas emissions reductions necessary to prevent cataclysmic climate change.  This challenge for the US, China and the rest of the world comes at a time not only of increasing threats from global warming, but also the most severe global economic crisis since the Great Depression. The economic meltdown has an immediate and daily-worsening impact while the climate-change crisis is more invisible and slow-developing \u2013 although with potentially more disastrous and long-lasting consequences. Political leaders are under great pressure to focus their attention on halting and reversing the economic death spiral that began with the global financial crisis last autumn. Failure to address global warming as part of the economic recovery effort, however, could greatly increase the long-term costs of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and the impacts of climate change. The planned stimulus packages by the United States and China promise vast increases in government resources and directed investment, which offer great potential \u2013 if properly directed \u2013 to accelerate transition to a global low-carbon economy while pulling the world out of recession.  To establish their new strategic relationship in the early 1970s, China and the United States overcame more than 20 years of mutual isolation, ideological rivalry, and intense hostility, including fighting a hot war in Korea from 1950 to 1953, a near-conflict over Taiwan in the late 1950s, and a proxy war in Vietnam in the 1960s. While the shared objective of the US-China rapprochement was the containment and strategic isolation of the Soviet Union, the ultimate, long-term effect was to spur the peaceful demise of the Soviet Union and its eastern European empire, thereby ending the Cold War and creating one integrated world economy. The US-China rapprochement also created the international conditions for China&apos;s successful opening to the outside and its economic reform, leading to the extraordinary reemergence of China \u2013 and the acceleration of the process of globalisation.  The US-China rapprochement of the early 1970s was based on strategic calculations and decisions by the top leaders in both countries to deal with the common strategic challenge posed by the Soviet Union. These decisions set in motion a process that led to far more massive international change than a reconfiguration of big-power relations to counterbalance rising Soviet power. The decisions at the top in the two countries unleashed a largely bottom-up process that involved daily decisions and actions of hundreds of millions of people in China and around the world, which transformed the global strategic fabric and created the increasingly interconnected, globalised world we have today. Now, a shared strategic threat is posed by not by an external enemy but by our own efforts to achieve economic development and prosperity. The climate-change threat is more slow-moving and diffuse than the nuclear threat hanging over the Cold War, but the long-term danger to civilization may be no less existential. The response to this new strategic threat must begin like the US-China rapprochement in the 1970s, with initial decisions by the top leadership of the two nations that set in motion a long-term process that would prove to be even more transformative perhaps than initially envisioned. Similarly, key strategic decisions and concerted efforts to establish the necessary conditions for a transformation of the US and Chinese economies could unleash the creativity, resourcefulness, competitiveness and determination of millions of people and businesses to speed the world&apos;s transition to a low-carbon, sustainable economy.  A new opportunity has emerged in both countries. US president Barack Obama has stated that mitigating climate change will be a high priority for his administration, which is committed to 80% reductions of greenhouse-gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. His stimulus plan includes commitment of massive resources for building a new clean energy infrastructure, greater efforts to enhance energy efficiency, and new steps to move away from dependence on fossil fuels. Although China is not yet willing to commit to emissions reduction targets, Chinese leaders have a similar perspective on the climate-change threat and the need for transition to a low-carbon economy. They are also planning to devote stimulus resources to energy efficiency, green technologies and other efforts to build a low-carbon energy infrastructure.  It is essential that both the Obama administration and the Chinese leadership engage at the highest levels to begin a new programme of significantly scaled-up cooperation on energy and climate change as soon as possible. Successful US-China cooperation on energy and climate security will substantially enhance prospects for a new international climate agreement as well as bolstering political support in each country for climate change mitigation policies. It will also build mutual trust between the United States and China, strengthen the US-China partnership for tackling a wide range of common strategic challenges in the twenty-first century, and be a constructive force in US-China relations at a point in time when the American public is increasingly sceptical of the benefits of bilateral economic integration.

There had been speculation that Samsung, which recently leapfrogged Nokia to become market leader in the UK, would unveil its first phone running Android at next week&apos;s Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona. But Younghee Lee, head of marketing at Samsung&apos;s mobile device division, said there will be no Android phone at the show, but they are &quot;planning internally&quot; for a release in the second half of the year. She said the company is in negotiations with a number of operators about taking a Samsung-designed Android phone. The news came as Samsung unveiled what it says will be one of its flagship handsets for the coming year - a slimmer version of its highly successful Tocco touchscreen device. In the latter half of last year, the original Tocco became the most popular phone for people signing up to a monthly contract in the UK. Samsung is hoping for similar success from the new version of the phone, which is expected to go on sale next month. Samsung is making touchscreen phones one of its areas of focus for 2009 as the industry faces its first downturn since the dotcom crash, and several executives say the mobile phone market is polarising. The market for entry-level phones is still booming in emerging markets but in more mature markets the middle ground has all but disappeared - consumers are either keeping their existing handsets and trading down to cheaper sim-only deals, or demanding the latest in must-have top of the range gadgetry, including touchscreens. To meet this demand, Vodafone recently launched the BlackBerry Storm, while T-Mobile had hoped to score a hit with the first Android phone, the G1, developed by Taiwan&apos;s HTC. Since it hit the shops last autumn, however, sales of the G1 appear to have been disappointing. In the UK, T-Mobile lost 16,000 customers in the run-up to Christmas. In contrast, Vodafone added 449,000 in the same period.  There is talk that HTC will announce the next version of its Android phone, the G2, at Mobile World Congress. Leaked online photos, purporting to depict the device, appear to show that HTC has dumped the slide-out keypad for the new model. T-Mobile is not expected to stock the new version of the phone in the UK, though it may carry it in the US. Last week, Matthew Key - boss of Telefonica Europe, which owns O2 - said customers are less willing to commit to 18-month contracts because of the downturn. &quot;The middle ground in the market is starting to disappear, (but) clearly in destination purchase end you have things like the iPhone, like the Storm, like the G1 device,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/12/recession-financial-chiefs", "publicationDate": "2009-02-12T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Banking", "Royal Bank of Scotland", "HBOS", "Economics", "Economic policy", "Regulators", "Business", "Politics"], "sentences": ["Intelligent, open-minded and energetic, the Welsh-speaking son of a Midland bank manager from Colwyn Bay, Davies turned Standard Chartered into a powerful international bank, buying businesses in Taiwan, Korea and entering China."], "title": "The government's financial chiefs", "article": "Glen Moreno US-born Moreno, 65, was appointed by the government only last month to look after the taxpayer stakes in RBS and the new Lloyds Banking Group. But he has already run into trouble. Last weekend it emerged that the multimillionaire fund manger was a former trustee at the notorious Liechtenstein Global Trust (LGT), a private bank based in the tax haven. LGT is at the centre of an alleged tax evasion investigation in Germany, America, Australia and the UK. Tellingly the prime minister failed to fully endorse Moreno during prime minister&apos;s questions yesterday. Furthermore, Fidelity, the huge investment firm where Moreno is on the board, is a huge donor to the Conservative party. Moreno also chairs Pearson, the media group.  Sir David Walker When appointing the head of a government inquiry into bankers&apos; bonuses, it might help if the person carrying out the task has not raked in millions of pounds in a city career that has also seen him sanction tens of millions of pounds to colleagues at one of the world&apos;s most aggressive investment banks, Morgan Stanley. But the man leading the inquiry, Walker, finds himself in this very position. Walker, 69, is otherwise known as Mr Whitewash for what critics complained were anodyne reports into the private equity industry and ethical standards at BAE in the wake of the corruption scandal. The Cambridge-educated economist started out at the Treasury in 1961 and held numerous key posts over 15 years at the Bank of England, later becoming deputy chairman of Lloyds. Sir Philip Hampton Trained as an accountant, Hampton was the man chosen in November to look after the taxpayers&apos; stakes in RBS and Lloyds Bank Group. But last month Hampton, 55, was offered the job of chairing Royal Bank of Scotland and promptly cleared out a number of directors associated with the fallen bank giant. Having taken a salary of \u00a3750,000 to chair the 70% taxpayer-owned bank, he now finds himself at the centre of the furore over staff bonuses.  Lady Vadera Gordon Brown&apos;s hatchet woman, Shriti Vadera, 46, is a former Warburg investment banker who reduces aides to tears, bludgeons policies through Whitehall and is a key member of the prime minister&apos;s inner circle. Last month on the day that 7,200 jobs were axed and the stock market saw 5% of its value wiped off, the Oxford-educated peer suggested there were signs of economic &quot;green shoots&quot;. It was an embarrassing gaffe and she knew it, though her enemies - and there are many - were probably beside themselves with glee. Probably the most powerful Asian woman in Britain, in an interview last month Ugandan-born Vadera insisted: &quot;I wear my gender and race very lightly.&quot; Lord Myners Parachuted into the Treasury as financial services secretary last October when the banking system came close to total collapse, the adopted son of a Truro butcher has recently attacked bankers as greedy and arrogant, though Myners, 60, has had long experience as a banker himself, formerly as a director at Coutts, Bank of New York, NatWest and chairman of Guardian Media Group. He is one of the best connected figures in the City. Formerly chair of GLG Partners, the hedge fund that made tens of millions shorting shares, he was also behind controversial plans to split Britain&apos;s biggest property company, Land Securities in three, which were recently scrapped. Lord (Mervyn) Davies Popular former Standard Chartered banker was last month recruited by Brown to fly the flag for British business as the new trade minister replacing Digby Jones. Davies, 57, was a crucial backroom fixer in the government&apos;s \u00a3500bn bank bailout last autumn. Intelligent, open-minded and energetic, the Welsh-speaking son of a Midland bank manager from Colwyn Bay, Davies turned Standard Chartered into a powerful international bank, buying businesses in Taiwan, Korea and entering China.

But Stu has other plans. He&apos;s in his hotel room in America, waiting for Hanna - who, he hopes, is on her way to blow him more spectacularly than he&apos;s ever been blown before. Weirdly, he decides to call home to tell his wife the plan and, unsurprisingly, Alison blows her top - ironic really, when you think about it. Hanna is a hurricane. And Stuart Robinson is A Very British Storm Junkie (Channel 4). Hurricanes and typhoons are his thing. Nothing gets him going more than a big white swirl on a meteorological map. He&apos;ll pack his bag and hop on a plane - to America, Taiwan, anywhere.  You know when you get those pictures on the news of bumper-to-bumper cars on the freeway, headed out of Houston or wherever before a big storm hits, and the carriageway on the other side, going into town, is eerily empty? Then suddenly there&apos;s one car speeding that way and you&apos;re thinking: &quot;Wrong way, mate - turn around, quick.&quot; That&apos;ll be Stu, with his bag of tricks, anemometers, waterproof trousers, etc. He loves to stand in a really big storm, leaning into it with his ski goggles on to protect his eyes and his wind measurer in the air, yelping with delight as the numbers climb - 70, 80, 90mph. Stu prayed for a storm on their wedding day. Nothing would have made him happier than killer confetti ripping across the churchyard in the wind like shrapnel. In the end, they just got a bit of rain. Ten thousand spoons when all you need is a fork.  You&apos;d think that someone whose favourite place in the whole world is inside the eye of a hurricane would be a tough guy - macho, silent, broad-shouldered, with a bit of swagger about him. Played by Bruce Willis maybe, when they do the movie. Oh, no. Stu&apos;s scrawny and thinning a bit up there and, well, not very cool at all. There&apos;s something of Eddie the Eagle about him. He&apos;s in IT, and that makes sense, if you know what I&apos;m saying. I&apos;d say that Rowan Atkinson would make a good Stu.  He does attempt bravado, telling us how dangerous it is, but his hard-arse act doesn&apos;t really fool anyone. And when he&apos;s in a storm, he loses it altogether. &quot;Keep it together, Stu, keep it together,&quot; he tells himself, gripping hold of the steering wheel as he drives through a storm in America. I&apos;m not sure about a movie, but it makes an amusing hour of television. I would have liked a little more weather, more about the storms (Hanna pretty much wiped Haiti off the map, I seem to remember), but this is Stu&apos;s show, and he&apos;s jolly well going to be the star.  It&apos;s when he decides to put his foot down over Hanna, and show his wife who&apos;s boss, that Stu really comes into his own. &quot;I tell you what, I&apos;m really annoyed now, really annoyed,&quot; he says, pacing up and down his hotel room after his second conversation with Alison. He calls her back a third time. &quot;I&apos;m telling you now, I&apos;m stopping out for this storm,&quot; he tells her. And that&apos;s the end of the matter. Except that a few hours later he&apos;s on his way, unblown, and with his tail between his legs. No Hanna this time. Is there any more loathsome sight in this world than Piers Morgan at the wheel of a red convertible, looking smug? No, there isn&apos;t. And in Piers Morgan On Hollywood (ITV1) we get to see it again and again: Piers off to see Mel B, driving around palm-fringed avenues in Beverly Hills, on Sunset Boulevard, pulling up at the Osbournes&apos; place. It&apos;s almost as if this is really about Piers (yeah, I know, I said that last time, I&apos;m just emphasising it, OK?)  There&apos;s really only one word for him, but after consulting the Guardian style guide I&apos;m not sure I can justify using it. I have to remember the reader, and not casually use words that are likely to offend, it says. Well, what about the programme? They&apos;re casually using shots of Piers in his Jaguar, and I&apos;m finding that very offensive. The style guide continues: the stronger the swearword, the harder we ought to think about using it.

But the impact of the Michelle look has never been felt as strongly as now. The public&apos;s fascination with the 45-year-old&apos;s style has put the spotlight on her favourite designers at New York Fashion Week. One has already hit the catwalk, sending ripples of excitement through the fashion world. Jason Wu, recently a little-known designer who grew up in Taiwan, has become one of the most talked about names in the industry since Michelle chose his frothy gown for the Neighbourhood Inaugural Ball last month. Last Friday his new-found reputation was sealed when a standing-room-only audience watched the catwalk show of his autumn/winter collection. His parents - Jennifer and Hank Wu, who had flown over from Taipeh - were a few seats behind Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue. After all, here was the designer who had created the pink sheath dress that Michelle wears on the cover of Wintour&apos;s March edition. &quot;It&apos;s great to see that you can look powerful without forgoing femininity,&quot; said Sally Singer, fashion news director of American Vogue. &quot;She looks like a grown-up but also looks pretty.&quot; What is increasingly clear is that the first-lady look is one women want to mimic and retailers want to sell. Wu said he has had three times as many appointments made by buyers this season - and he isn&apos;t the only Michelle favourite making a breakthrough. Designs by feminine, dressy label Thakoon and chic, minimalist Zero + Maria Cornejo line, who both show tomorrow, were frequently worn by Obama during the presidential campaign and the labels&apos; profiles have risen from cult status to international recognition. Michelle wore a Thakoon dress in August 2008 when she joined her husband on stage as he accepted the Democratic nomination. &quot;There was a lot of talk about Thakoon then, it was the big deal in all the showrooms,&quot; said Dickon Bowden, buyer for the London store Dover Street Market which stocks many of Michelle&apos;s favourite designer brands.  &quot;There&apos;s definitely been an impact,&quot; added Gabrielle Sirkin, who works for label Zero + Maria Cornejo. &quot;We&apos;ve had interview requests from editors who don&apos;t normally even attend our show. We&apos;re also looking to expand our stockists - we&apos;re heading to the UK to look at stores outside London.&quot; Singer said the Obama effect works in different ways: &quot;For Thakoon, she showed his clothes have a life off the catwalk and off fashion girls. To see this 5ft 11in woman looking fabulous in Thakoon is a great sign for retailers. For Cornejo, Obama gave her fashion credibility.&quot; Narciso Rodr\u00edguez, a Cuban American designer whose clothes Michelle wore for her husband&apos;s victory speech in November and to attend the &quot;We Are One&quot; concert last month, shows on Tuesday. Proenza Schouler, another American fashion favourite who has gained wider recognition thanks to Michelle&apos;s taste, shows on Wednesday. Cuban-born designer Isabel Toledo, who created the yellow dress Michelle wore for January&apos;s inauguration ceremony, will not show at fashion week, but a retrospective of her work will be held at New York&apos;s Fashion Institute of Technology in June. But not all the coverage has been positive. Ikram Goldman owns the Ikram boutique in the Obamas&apos; hometown of Chicago and acts as intermediary for most of the first lady&apos;s dealings with designers. Her boutique stocks the labels with which Michelle has become more associated.  &quot;It&apos;s strange to think that the wife of the leader of the free world would choose clothes from only one store, when there is a wealth of clothes out there from other designers,&quot; Arnold Scaasi, a designer who has dressed Hillary Clinton, Jacqueline Kennedy and Barbara Bush, recently told the New York Times But Ikram only influences one part of Michelle&apos;s wardrobe. She loves the high street, often wearing Gap, H&amp;M and Banana Republic with the designer items. And while the first lady talks about wearing clothes she loves and that fashion should make women feel good about themselves, she rarely endorses brands. One of the few endorsements she has given, during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in October 2008, was to J Crew, a US high-street staple which started as a mail-order catalogue range. She turned to the audience and said: &quot;Ladies, we know J Crew. You can get some good stuff online.&quot; In her Vogue shoot, Michelle also models exclusive designs from J Crew&apos;s new lines. So for those who can&apos;t afford the designers stepping out in New York it seems there is an altogether cheaper way to achieve the Michelle look. The world&apos;s greatest asset to designer clothes: the first lady, wearing ... Jason Wu  The 26-year-old designer, who was born in Taiwan and raised in Canada, started his label, which specialises in pretty dresses, in 2006, using funds from his family and from a job he has had since the age of 16 creating $400 designer dolls for Integrity Toys. Thakoon From his first collection in 2004, Thakoon Panichgul&apos;s label has been beloved by women who like elegant, feminine designs. Panichgul, 34, was born in Thailand and raised in the US, working as a fashion writer before launching his label. Maria Pinto This Chicago-based designer, 51, has been a long-time favourite for Michelle, who has worn her vibrantly coloured dresses since 2004. Pinto started her own business in 1991 but hit the headlines when Michelle wore one of her creations to the Democratic convention. Narciso Rodriguez The son of Cuban immigrants, Rodr\u00edguez was born in New Jersey in 1961. He worked with Calvin Klein and Donna Karan before launching his own label in 1998. Best-known of the designers favoured by Obama, his clothes have been worn by Sarah Jessica Parker and Kate Winslet. Zero + Maria Cornejo Born in Chile, raised in the UK, now living in New York, Maria Cornejo is known for chic suits and elegant designs with an emphasis on draping and silhouette.

At family occasions, he was the one who would spin fantastic yarns with only a kernel of truth. He was the clown, the joker, the raconteur whose tales had to be taken with a liberal pinch of salt. &quot;I remember him laughing, being silly and making jokes that weren&apos;t funny,&quot; recalls his wife&apos;s nephew, Bernard Haykel. &quot;He was quite a jovial character, fun-loving. He always seemed pretty harmless.&quot; One of Uncle Herman&apos;s favourite stories was about how he met his wife Roma. He would recount the astonishing tale of how, as an 11-year-old Polish Jew interned by the Nazis in a sub-camp of Buchenwald, he was sustained by a young girl who came each day to throw him apples over the fence. He never knew her name. In 1945, Rosenblat and his three elder brothers were liberated by allied troops from Theresienstadt concentration camp, where they had been transferred shortly before the armistice. Twelve years later, Rosenblat was living in New York when a friend set him up on a blind date. In an incredible twist of fate, the curly-haired woman with green eyes who was his date for the evening turned out to be his childhood saviour, the girl who had thrown him apples all those years before: his &quot;angel at the fence&quot;. He proposed on the spot, against the twinkling lights of the Coney Island amusement parks. They were married in 1958 and had two children, Ken, born in 1960, followed two years later by their daughter, Renee. To begin with, it was an anecdote he shared only with friends or new acquaintances. Then, in 1995, Rosenblat wrote it up and entered a newspaper competition to find the best Valentine&apos;s Day-themed short story. He won and his story was featured on the front page of the New York Post. Television crews and local reporters swiftly tracked the couple down. Within months, the Rosenblats were appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show, sitting hand in hand on a cream sofa, in the full glare of studio lights. In the years that followed, Rosenblat was signed up by a literary agent who brokered a book deal. A movie producer expressed an interest in adapting his story for the big screen. The Rosenblats, now living in Miami, began appearing at local schools and Holocaust-education centres, with Herman giving his moving account of how love triumphed over the forces of hatred. He enjoyed the attention. &quot;He was very jolly but he was also a show-off,&quot; says Sidney Finkel, 77, a lifelong family friend. He was from the same Polish town as the Rosenblat brothers and was interned with them at Buchenwald. &quot;He was always bragging about all the publicity he got. He wanted to stand out so badly.&quot; In 2007, the couple appeared once more on The Oprah Winfrey Show where Rosenblat got down on one knee to profess his continuing devotion to his wife. Oprah, teary with emotion, described it as &quot;the single greatest love story we&apos;ve ever told on the air&quot;. The following year saw the publication of a book for younger readers, Angel Girl, written by children&apos;s author Laurie Friedman. Rosenblat&apos;s memoir, Angel at the Fence, was slated for publication by Berkley Books in 2009. Richard Dreyfuss was rumoured to have signed up for the $25m film adaptation. Life was good for the Rosenblats. There was just one problem - it wasn&apos;t true. Although Rosenblat did survive the Holocaust and his marriage to Roma was genuine, the story of a young girl throwing him apples was a fabrication. His &quot;angel at the fence&quot; was a fake. Today, the Rosenblats live in a dispiriting sprawl of beige 1970s apartment blocks in North Miami, just up the freeway from the Aventura Mall shopping complex that caters for the constant stream of tourists who come in search of year-round Florida sunshine. The condominium has seen better days. The Rosenblats&apos; front door, painted a dull green, now peeling, overlooks a communal garden with a neglected swimming pool where the younger residents come to hang out and smoke joints. Security guards are posted at the entrance of the car park. When I ring their bell, Roma answers, her unsmiling face blurred by the mesh of the security screen. She is a squat but formidable 76-year-old, wearing a striped shirt over cream trousers and lumpish slippers. Her short hair is dyed brown. Her small, dark eyes squint into the light. Herman, 78, is standing silently in the corridor behind her, an imposing man in glasses and a goatee.  I ask if they are Mr and Mrs Rosenblat. &quot;No,&quot; she says flatly, in a thick eastern European accent. &quot;They&apos;re not here. They don&apos;t live here.&quot; But having already seen photos of the couple, I know it is them. When I say I would like to give them a letter, it is Herman who softens. He takes a few steps forward and gestures with his hands for Roma to open the screen. She takes the letter and closes the door. As I walk away, I wonder if either of them is struck by the irony that they are still lying about who they are.  Doubts about the Rosenblat memoir started circulating on the internet and were mentioned by the eminent Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt on her website as early as December 2007. Shortly afterwards, Danny Bloom, a 60-year-old expatriate Jewish American living in Taiwan, picked up on some of the story&apos;s discrepancies and started emailing academic experts asking them to look into the veracity of Rosenblat&apos;s account. &quot;I just remember thinking, &apos;How could this humanly be possible?&apos;&quot; says Bloom, over a crackling, long-distance phone line. &quot;My challenge was to prove it wasn&apos;t kosher.&quot;  One of the academics Bloom emailed was Ken Waltzer, the Madison professor of Jewish studies at Michigan State University. Waltzer, who was writing a book about the children of Buchenwald, had already made his own tentative inquiries into the Rosenblat story. Strangely, out of all the survivors who had helped him with his research, Herman Rosenblat was one of the few who did not respond to Waltzer&apos;s repeated requests for an interview. &quot;In November 2008, I was contacted by two forensic genealogists who were investigating the memoir,&quot; he explains. &quot;They were able to give me maps of the Buchenwald sub-camp Schlieben [in south Brandenburg, near Berlin]. We already knew from survivor testimonies that to go to the fence was punishable by death and there was a high risk you would be electrocuted. The maps showed that the only external fence was down by the SS barracks [the other three faced inwards] and that civilians had been banned from the road that ran alongside it since 1943 so there was no way that Herman and Roma could have had a rendezvous.&quot; Waltzer and his associates then looked into the matter of Roma&apos;s whereabouts during the Second World War. In his story, Herman had claimed that Roma and her family, whose surname was Radzicki, were Polish Jews living under assumed identities on a nearby farm. There was no trace of them. &quot;The upshot of it all was that the family was some distance away in Brieg, near Breslau, Lower Silesia [today Brzeg, near Wroclaw, Poland],&quot; says Waltzer. &quot;The story was completely untrue. If Roma Radzicki wasn&apos;t there, then she wasn&apos;t throwing him apples. &quot;There are no redemptive endings in the Holocaust. In this case, the dark truth was hidden to spin a story of romance, to portray the universe as an orderly and just place and that, to me, is a denial of the substance of the Holocaust .&quot; News of the Rosenblat hoax finally broke last December. Berkley Books swiftly dropped plans to publish his memoir. The children&apos;s book was pulped. Oprah, who was famously duped in 2005 by A Million Little Pieces, a fake memoir written by James Frey, declared herself &quot;very disappointed&quot;. Rosenblat issued a curiously unapologetic statement claiming that his motivation was &quot;to make good in this world&quot;. &quot;I wanted to bring happiness to people, to remind them not to hate, but to love and tolerate all people,&quot; the statement read. &quot;In my dreams, Roma will always throw me an apple, but I now know it is only a dream.&quot; Herman Rosenblat is not the first person to write a fake Holocaust memoir, but he is one of the most intriguing. Unlike Binjamin Wilkomirski, a professional clarinettist who invented an entirely false personal history in his 1995 book, Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood, or Misha Defonseca, who published Misha: A M\u00e9moire of the Holocaust Years in 1997, in which she claimed to have been sheltered through the Holocaust by a pack of wolves, Rosenblat genuinely did survive the concentration camps. In fact, one of the most surprising aspects of Rosenblat&apos;s hoax is that it obscured the impact of a real-life story that was, if anything, even more compelling.     An electrified barbed wire fence rings the perimeter of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany, photographed in 1988, near Weimar. Photograph: Ira Nowinski/Corbis    In 1942, Rosenblat and his three older brothers - Isidore, Sam and Abraham - were living in the Jewish ghetto of Piotrkow, Poland, when they were transported by cattle truck to Schlieben, a sub-camp of Buchenwald. Their father had died from typhus shortly before. The children were rounded up by the Nazis and separated from their mother whom they never saw again. Encouraged by Isidore, 11-year-old Herman lied about his age so that the brothers would not be separated - older boys were deemed more useful to the Nazis for labour. The brothers would later discover that 90 per cent of the town&apos;s inhabitants, including their mother, had been sent straight to the death camps. &quot;He told the SS men he was 16,&quot; says Debi Gade, a television producer from New York who met the Rosenblats three years ago and has since become a family friend. &quot;He told me that, in the camps, an older brother used to take his tiny piece of bread and give it to Herman so that he could sustain himself. He told me that he was once beaten so badly by the guards that he was blind for several days and he couldn&apos;t tell them because they would have killed him. I&apos;m Jewish, so it resonates particularly with me - it is the most horrible, horrible story.&quot; Since he lied about one aspect of his experience, the natural inclination is to question what else Rosenblat may have been tempted to exaggerate. But what is true is that Herman survived against the odds. After being liberated in 1945, he and his brothers were sent to England where he trained as an electrician. The Rosenblat siblings were among some 730 orphans who were brought to the UK to start a new life; their contemporaries included Ben Helfgott, who went on to represent Great Britain as an Olympic weightlifter. Rosenblat subsequently emigrated to America, serving in the US army during the Korean War, then returning to New York to set up an electronics repair shop in 1957. The following year, he married Roma Radzicki, a nurse who had emigrated to the States with her brother Harvey and sister Milla. The couple did meet on a blind date. That much, at least, is true. Roma&apos;s story, unearthed by Waltzer, proved equally remarkable. Her family, originally from the central Polish town of Krosniewice, lived under assumed identities in Germany from 1941 until the end of the war. One of her two sisters was deemed too young and too dark to pass herself off as a Christian. She was left behind to face certain death. Nearly all of Roma&apos;s extended family was wiped out. For the first 35 years of their marriage, there was no mention of the little girl who threw Rosenblat apples over the concentration camp fence to help him survive. Neither Rosenblat&apos;s brothers, whose closeness had been forged through extraordinary trauma, nor his wider friendship group of fellow survivors, had ever heard him reveal the remarkable happenstance that lay at the heart of his happy marriage. That changed in 1992 when Rosenblat&apos;s Brooklyn store was broken into by armed robbers. Rosenblat and his son Ken were shot at by the intruders. Ken, then only 32, was paralysed, consigned to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Rosenblat was more fortunate; his life was spared, although the bullet, according to Debi Gade, remains lodged in his body. It was while he was recovering in hospital that Rosenblat claimed his mother came to him in a dream and instructed him to share his story with a wider public. He started to tell his friends, explaining away his former reticence by saying that it had been a period of his life he had previously wished to forget. Then, three years later, he entered the newspaper competition. Herman Rosenblat&apos;s life was about to change forever. I meet Diana Moskovitz, a petite woman in strappy silver heels and sepia sunglasses, at a coffee house in Fort Lauderdale. Moskovitz, a journalist for the Miami Herald, reported the Rosenblat story as it unfolded in the normally quiet news days just after Christmas. She says that Rosenblat struck her not as a malicious con-artist but, rather, as a sweet, somewhat naive old man whose penchant for telling tales rapidly snowballed out of his control. &quot;He reminded me of my own grandfather [a Czechoslovakian Jew], the type who tells stories because it brings people happiness, but everyone knows they&apos;re not really true,&quot; she says. &quot;You know - if he says the fish is five feet long, it&apos;s really probably five inches.&quot; Interestingly, the Rosenblats initially demurred from appearing on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1996; the production team called their apartment twice without success before Winfrey herself picked up the phone to convince them. Rosenblat was doubtless flattered by the attention. &quot;His motivation was just to be known, to be loved, to tell the best story he could,&quot; says Sidney Finkel. &quot;He was a joyful, bountiful man, always telling jokes, but I can&apos;t say I warmed to him.&quot; For reasons that remain obscure, Roma agreed to go along with the ruse. The family members and friends I speak to are unwilling to guess at her motives, but almost all of them point to Roma&apos;s history of depression. There are rumours of suicide attempts and periods of hospitalisation. A nurse makes daily visits to the Rosenblat apartment. &quot;She&apos;s not a mentally healthy person,&quot; says her nephew Bernard Haykel. &quot;She has this tragic depressive streak and I don&apos;t think she was fully compos mentis.&quot; In public, Roma appeared to be the passive spectator while Herman took the conversational lead. Rabbi Anchelle Perl, a close acquaintance of the couple, says that whenever he met Roma &quot;there seemed to be lots of things playing on her mind&quot;. According to Rabbi Perl, Rosenblat would often appear strangely isolated from what was going on around him. When, in 2006, Rabbi Perl performed Rosenblat&apos;s bar mitzvah - the traditional Jewish ceremony that marks a boy&apos;s transition from youth to adulthood, which Rosenblat had been denied in the camps - he recalls that Rosenblat &quot;came, left and he didn&apos;t seem to identify with people as much as I thought someone from his background would. He was there and then he wasn&apos;t. &quot;He is a dreamer and I think his story mushroomed and got out of hand before he could stop it and after a while, it got so big that it was difficult to get out of.  &quot;I don&apos;t think he&apos;s manipulative, but he is not a person who shows an amazing amount of openness or emotion.&quot; While Rosenblat&apos;s fabrication expanded around him, his family knew he was lying. Both his children, Ken and Renee, were said to have been deeply uncomfortable with the story and urged their parents to stay out of the media spotlight. Rosenblat&apos;s rapid rise to semi-celebrity also caused an irrevocable rift with his last surviving brother, Sam, who died in February 2007, still refusing to speak to him. His wife Jutta remains estranged from her brother-in-law. &quot;My parents felt terrible about it,&quot; says their son, Ron Rosenblat, a 53-year-old estate agent in New York. &quot;At one point, when my father couldn&apos;t tolerate it any longer, he stopped speaking to his brother. They were as close as two brothers ever could be. It was a very sad set of circumstances. &quot;I think he [Herman] did it for fame and money. He took a horrible story and embellished it for what I believe were personal, psychological reasons and for financial gain.  &quot;What Herman did was reprehensible for the obvious reasons. One, it fuels anti-semitism and two, it maligns a horrible, horrible event. It makes almost a joke of it by creating an embellishment that&apos;s so ... almost comical.&quot; Did Ron&apos;s parents ever try to stop him? &quot;They spoke with him privately but it was not in their character to speak out publicly. In some ways, my mother is glad about what&apos;s happened because for her the truth is more important than anything else. It was more of a burden for my father - it was a source of incredible pain to him.&quot; Still, it seems astonishing both that no one challenged him for so long and that, once signed up by Berkley Books (an imprint of Penguin) no one thought to check Rosenblat&apos;s assertions against verifiable fact, despite concerned emails from Waltzer and others. Sidney Finkel, too, knew that Herman&apos;s story was a lie as far back as 1996. At dinner in a Chicago hotel the evening before the Rosenblats were due to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show for the first time, Finkel recalls that Roma admitted to him she had spent the war in hiding in Germany, aided by a Catholic priest, without once making reference to meeting Herman by throwing him apples over a concentration camp fence. &quot;I knew graphically then that the story had to be false because she was nowhere near the camp,&quot; says Finkel. &quot;For her, it was like living a fantasy. She had a terrific grip on reality - that was one thing - and then the other thing she treated as if she were on stage. &quot;I felt a little bit angry but I must admit that I was also kind of impressed he was going on The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot; The Buchenwald orphans, who remain a close-knit group, had their own suspicions. &quot;All the survivors thought it was improbable,&quot; Finkel says. &quot;There was not a single one of us who believed it. But we didn&apos;t want to make any judgment because we didn&apos;t think it would go any further.&quot; Bernard Haykel says that a similar sense of indulgence operated within the family. &quot;I told Herman on a couple of occasions that the Holocaust is a very serious thing and no fabrication should be made. I don&apos;t think I was taken very seriously. His reaction was, &apos;Oh what&apos;s the harm in it? It&apos;s a good story, people get to learn about the Holocaust , they get to feel good after it.&apos; It was a kind of joke.  &quot;You&apos;re talking about a man who is very uneducated, who didn&apos;t get to go to school from the age of 11, so I don&apos;t think there was a lot of thought given to the ethical issues. &quot;You have to realise the context: Herman had a terrible tragedy when he was held up at gunpoint where he worked. The family just thought anything that kept him busy and gave meaning to his life, well, what&apos;s the harm?&quot; And perhaps there is a sense in which Rosenblat&apos;s stories were a survival technique, a means of dissociating himself from the horrific experiences he underwent and of creating a new, happier ending for his own narrative. Perhaps, for the first time, Rosenblat felt in control of a life that had previously been buffeted by a series of external tragedies over which he had no power. But when it became clear that Rosenblat&apos;s supposedly harmless anecdotes were spiralling into something more worrying, there was a growing consensus that it was time to speak out. When Rosenblat started a publicity drive for his memoir (adapted by a professional ghost-writer from his oral transcripts), Finkel became &quot;concerned and angry&quot;. He told Waltzer of his suspicions. The other Buchenwald survivors, including their unofficial leader, Ben Helfgott, followed suit. According to Waltzer: &quot;There was a real fear that Herman Rosenblat would be adding a fraudulent written record to Holocaust history. That would discount the quality of other, true memoirs.&quot; And that, he says, would give further ammunition to Holocaust-deniers. In the weeks since their hoax was uncovered, the Rosenblats have shrunk from the attention they once courted. They have changed their phone number several times; there is now a screening device that ensures every caller has to identify themselves by name before they answer. Rabbi Perl says they have been shocked by the fall-out and did not expect the vociferous criticism levelled at them by fellow Holocaust survivors. They have received hate mail. Forced into a corner, the Rosenblats have retreated into a familiar position: they are doing what they have to do in order to survive. For understandable reasons, perhaps, Herman Rosenblat chooses not to speak to me. Of all the people I talk to, not one of them says he has ever apologised. &quot;He is still dreaming,&quot; says Rabbi Perl. &quot;It is hard for him to say, &apos;I made a mistake.&apos; &quot; A 20-minute drive south of the Rosenblats&apos; apartment takes you to the Holocaust Memorial in Miami Beach, a large, tiled square dominated by a central pool of water. At its nucleus, there is a giant sculpture of a hand grabbing at the sky in a gesture that lies somewhere between desperation and hope. As I look around, I am introduced to Joe, a white-haired man wearing a navy-blue Argyll V-neck. He stoops forward politely to shake my hand, but does not say anything. Later, Avi Mizrachi, the memorial&apos;s executive director, shows me a black-and-white photo, reproduced as part of a permanent exhibition. It depicts a group of thin, pale children being liberated from Buchenwald. He points at one gangly boy, gazing hopefully out of the monochrome smudge. &quot;And that,&quot; says Mizrachi, &quot;that is Joe.&quot; We stare at the picture in silence; the image requires no further explanation. Perhaps Joe did not need to speak to make his story worth hearing because it spoke for itself. And it strikes me that, with all the fabrications and lies that he built up around him, maybe the saddest realisation is that Herman Rosenblat did not believe his own survival was story enough. The truth will out: Rosenblat&apos;s claims vs the facts Claim: As an 11-year-old, Herman Rosenblat was interned by the Nazis in Schlieben, where an unidentified young girl came daily to the camp perimeter fence to give him apples and bread.  Fact: Rosenblat was at Schlieben concentration camp, but going to the fence was prohibited on pain of death. The only public road by the camp was closed to civilians from 1943. Claim: Rosenblat&apos;s &quot;angel at the fence&quot;, Roma Radzicki, was a Polish Jew in hiding with her family. They were living under false Catholic identities on a farm near the camp. Fact: Roma Radzicki was indeed in hiding under a false identity in Germany, but in Breslau, Lower Silesia, some 210 miles away from Schlieben.  Claim: Rosenblat was scheduled to die in the gas chambers at Theresienstadt at 10am on 10 May 1945. Two hours before the appointed time, the camp was liberated by allied forces. Fact: There were no gas chambers at Theresienstadt and, according to Holocaust historian Deborah Lipstadt: &quot;Jewish prisoners were not told ahead of time that they were going to be gassed.&quot;  Claim: In an incredible twist of fate, Rosenblat was reunited with his &quot;angel at the fence&quot; when he was set up on a blind date in New York in 1957. Rosenblat proposed then and there. Fact: Rosenblat and his wife did meet on a blind date in New York in 1957, but it was their first meeting. They were married a year later. False memoirs syndrome: Fakes, frauds and a million little lies In Love and Consequences: a Memoir of Hope and Survival, by Margaret B Jones Jones&apos;s 2008 memoir of her childhood as a mixed-race foster child growing up in poverty and running drugs for a Los Angeles street gang was exposed as a fake after her real-life sister read an interview with the author in The New York Times. In fact, Jones - real name Margaret Seltzer - grew up in an affluent, white family and attended an exclusive private school. Don&apos;t Ever Tell, by Kathy O&apos;Beirne This 2005 memoir painted a grim picture of growing up in 1960s Ireland. O&apos;Beirne said she was tortured by her labourer father, raped by four priests and sent to the notorious Magdalene laundries where she had an illegitimate child at 14. It sold 400,000 copies before it was revealed that the Magdalene laundries had no record of her. Five of her eight siblings claimed large parts of the book were fantasy. A Million Little Pieces, by James Frey Frey&apos;s 2003 account of his years of drug addiction and criminal activity was chosen by Oprah Winfrey as her Book Club selection in 2005 and became a bestseller. Though lauded by critics for his visceral prose, Frey was shown to have fabricated key events including his 87-day jail sentence: he was only incarcerated for a few hours. The book is now published with a note to readers in which Frey apologises for &quot;writing about the person I created in my mind to help me cope, and not the person who went through the experience&quot;. Misha: A Memoire of the Holocaust Years, by Misha Defonseca This 1997 book told the &quot;real-life story&quot; of a Jewish girl who survived the Holocaust by wandering through Europe in search of her deported parents. At one point, Defonseca claimed to have been sheltered by a pack of wolves. In February 2008 she admitted it was a fabrication: her real name was Monique de Wael and she was actually the daughter of two Catholic members of the Belgian Resistance. Although her parents were taken away by the Nazis, much else was untrue. De Wael said that the story was &quot;my reality, my way of surviving&quot;. Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood by Binjamin Wilkomirski First published in German in 1995, Fragments recounts the &quot;fractured memories&quot; of a Jewish boy traumatised by the Holocaust. Wilkomirski, a clarinettist and instrument maker living in Switzerland, said he was held in two concentration camps before being taken to an orphanage in Krakow. The book earned widespread critical acclaim and was translated into nine languages before an investigative journalist revealed it as a hoax. The Hitler Diaries In 1983 the German magazine Stern published extracts of the &quot;recently unearthed diaries of Adolf Hitler&quot;, covering the period 1932-1945. They were authenticated by experts, including the eminent British academic Hugh Trevor-Roper. But within two weeks of their publication they were revealed to be fakes, written on modern paper and littered with historical inaccuracies. They were actually written by Konrad Kujau, a forger from Stuttgart, who was subsequently sentenced to 42 months in prison. The Autobiography of Howard Hughes, by Clifford Irving In 1970 the American novelist Clifford Irving forged letters from the reclusive millionaire Howard Hughes that gave him permission to write Hughes&apos;s &quot;autobiography&quot;. Irving was given a $765,000 advance and, after a year of painstaking research, delivered the final manuscript to publishers. Irving eventually confessed in 1972 after Hughes publicly denounced him by telephone. The escapade was retold in the 2007 film, The Hoax, starring Richard Gere as Irving. Cradle of the Deep, by Joan Lowell Lowell, a silent film actress, claimed in her 1929 autobiography that her sea captain father took her as a baby to live on the trading ship Minnie A Caine. Lowell was supposedly raised alongside the all-male crew until the ship sank off the Australian coast when she was 17. The climactic chapter details her escape by swimming three miles with a family of kittens clinging to her back. The ship was discovered anchored safely in California after the book&apos;s publication. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 27 February 2009.

But behind the glitzy exhibition stands and the over-hyped press announcements there is a growing sense of panic as the effects of the global economic downturn start to show. Sales of mobile phones are expected to be at least 10% down this year \u2013 according to the world&apos;s largest manufacturer Nokia \u2013 at little more than a billion, and cash-strapped consumers are demanding ever cheaper deals. Attendance at the four-day Mobile World Congress is expected to be down on last year as companies, cutting staff and slashing costs, balk at the \u00a32,600 price of a delegate pass. Organiser the GSM Association is still hopeful of a last minute rush, but by the weekend 47,000 people had registered, down from 54,000 last year. Even Carphone Warehouse boss Charles Dunstone has decided to give the show a miss with his yacht \u2013 scene of many an industry party \u2013 missing from the harbour. Representatives of the GSM Association will meet many senior figures from the mobile phone networks at a &quot;Leadership Summit&quot; to discuss strategies for meeting the biggest economic challenge the industry has faced in its relatively short life. &quot;The business model of the mobile operators is creaking right now,&quot; according to Patrick Bossert from customer service experts Convergys, who has been watching the industry for years. &quot;They are having to look at where new revenue is coming from and they are on the back foot.&quot; Research house TNS reckons that in Britain the average spending of customers on monthly contracts has dropped by \u00a34 in the last year as they squeeze \u00adbetter deals from their supplier. Vodafone and O2 have admitted recently that many mobile phone customers are holding on to their existing handsets and &apos;trading down&apos; to SIM-only packages or even abandoning contracts for pre-pay deals. The traditional heartland of the industry \u2013 the mid-range phone market \u2013 has all but disappeared in the more mature markets of Europe, while growth in new subscribers is slowing across the world. The glimmer of hope that many in the mobile phone industry see is the paradoxical explosion in the so-called smartphone market in the wake of the arrival of Apple&apos;s iPhone a year and a half ago. The number of smartphones \u2013 handsets with multimedia functions, web browsers and high-specification cameras \u2013 purchased has doubled in the last year, according to TNS. They accounted for about 13% last year according to Juniper Research \u2013 but are bucking the overall gloomy trend. This fact, however, means that competition is increasing among manufacturers as electronics companies that have not traditionally made phones move in to grab market share. American electronic organiser maker Palm, for instance, hopes to resuscitate its fortunes with the Palm Pre Smartphone while this year&apos;s conference will play host to the release of the first smartphone from Toshiba \u2013 with the TG01 touchscreen Windows Mobile device \u2013 as well as handsets from Taiwanese notebook producer Acer. There is even speculation that PC manufacturer Dell is looking to get in on the act, although the company has denied it will be attending the show. Moreover, traditional handset manufacturers including China&apos;s ZTE, Taiwan&apos;s HTC, Nokia and Samsung, which last year leapfrogged Nokia to become the UK&apos;s number one handset provider, will be revealing their latest smartphones at the show. But the boom in smartphones is a double-edged sword for the mobile phone networks. TNS research shows the UK users with a smartphone spend about \u00a341 a month on their bill, double the average, but the phones are also generating a lot of revenue and internet traffic for rival companies \u2013 such as Google, Facebook and Apple \u2013 driving a wedge between the networks and their customers. The thin end of that wedge is the facility for consumers to download their own applications or onto their phone from an &apos;Apps store&apos;. The obvious example is Apple&apos;s iTunes which has programmes from games and weather maps to iPhone \u00adversions of popular social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter. This year&apos;s conference is expected to see mobile application stores launched by Samsung and Microsoft, which will also be updating its Windows Mobile operating system. RIM, maker of the BlackBerry, is working on its applications store; rumours are it will be launched next month. The worry for the phone networks is that these application stores are not under their control. The widgets do increase mobile phone usage, but as most smartphone users are on flat rate &quot;all you can eat&quot; internet access packages, that does not result in increased revenues. &quot;App stores distance the consumer from the network even further,&quot; according to Sam Curtis, sector development manager at TNS Technology. &quot;The traditional way of looking at it is: he who controls the screen controls the strategy and controls the consumer. First it was the handset manufacturer, then the network operator through their own portals, and now you are getting applications coming in which has taken the interface away from the network provider. Because the application stores and the mobile internet are open there is a huge question mark over who controls the consumer. &quot;So one of the things the networks are trying to do, especially in the UK, is to build more of an emotional connection with their customers such as what O2 is doing with the O2 arena&quot;. O2 is also trying to produce its own application community with its Litmus application store. The company will announce tomorrow that customers who sign up to try out applications that are under development will get the chance to earn money for their time. Orange, meanwhile, will announce that it is expanding its application store \u2013 that is accessed through the Orange World portal \u2013 to support more operating systems to keep its relationship with customers. What the networks are also trying to do is capitalise on one of the last winning cards they hold: information about what their customers are doing with their mobile phones. The mobile phone industry has talked about the potential for mobile advertising for years and while there are notable exceptions such as Blyk \u2013 which gives 16- to 24-year-old free calls and texts for taking part in market research \u2013 there has been very little progress. Part of the reason, the mobile phone industry reckons, is because it has been unable to provide advertisers with the sort of market data that they require to launch serious mobile advertising services. As a result the GSM Association will announce that it has successfully collected information about which websites are visited by mobile phone users in the UK and it will provide advertisers with mobile internet traffic data towards the end of the year. &quot;There are these two competing forces right now,&quot; according to Sam Curtis at TNS. &quot;On the one hand the recession and on the other hand the fact that for the first time in a while consumers are actually pretty excited and energised about the sorts of products and services that are being offered in the market. The big question now is: who is going to own this space.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/feb/18/netbooks-market-apple", "publicationDate": "2009-02-18T19:42:27Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Apple", "Computing", "Netbooks", "Acer"], "sentences": ["DigiTimes reports that: &quot;The global netbook market reached a scale of 14 million units in 2008, and with shipments continuing to rise, the scale will reach 25-30 million units in 2009, and 40-45 million units in 2010, according to Scott Lin, president of Acer Taiwan.&quot; This is rather more than even the Taiwanese were predicting last year.", "For example: back in August, MIC (Taiwan&apos;s Market Intelligence Center) predicted &quot;that the market size of mini-low price notebook PC will reach 8.02 million units in 2008, and will reach 18.3 million in 2009, a 128% growth from 2008.&quot; Western analysts were, I think, predicting rather smaller numbers.", "And since Apple uses exactly the same Taiwanese contract manufacturers as everybody else, I don&apos;t see why they shouldn&apos;t be."], "title": "Netbook market could hit 30m units this year -- is that enough to tempt Apple?", "article": "DigiTimes reports that: &quot;The global netbook market reached a scale of 14 million units in 2008, and with shipments continuing to rise, the scale will reach 25-30 million units in 2009, and 40-45 million units in 2010, according to Scott Lin, president of Acer Taiwan.&quot; This is rather more than even the Taiwanese were predicting last year.

As I reported, Gartner was predicting 5.3m for 2008, and 7.8 million in 2009. But netbooks are still a rather small part of the market. There should be around 300m PCs sold this year, based on actual sales of 271m in 2007 and 302m in 2008. (You can make your own guess about how bad things might get.) Anyway, 30m netbooks (topside) out of 300m PCs would only give netbooks 10% of the market. Or, if you want to look at it another way, netbooks would have at least 20% of the market for portable PCs, probably more. It would be interesting to know what Apple is thinking at the moment. It does not usually compete in low volume markets -- tablets, convertibles, handheld PCs etc -- and it does not compete at all in low cost markets. However, Apple has roughly 3.3% of the PC market today (based on Apple&apos;s November 10-K statement that it sold 9.7m Macs in fiscal 2008), and I reckon it could sell at least 10m Mac netbooks, if they were competitively priced. And since Apple uses exactly the same Taiwanese contract manufacturers as everybody else, I don&apos;t see why they shouldn&apos;t be. Yes, it might well hurt sales of more expensive MacBooks, but the gains -- including market share gains -- might be worth more than the losses."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/20/chinese-imperial-treasures-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2009-02-20T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "China arts 2008", "Heritage", "Art and design", "Culture", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Chinese imperial treasures kept in Beijing and Taipei are to be temporarily reunited after six decades - but only on one side of the Taiwan strait.", "China&apos;s state media reported this week that 29 Qing dynasty relics would be lent to Taiwan for an exhibition this year, as leaders seek to improve relations.", "But yesterday officials in Taipei said they had not made a reciprocal offer, despite mainland hopes that antiques carried to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek could return.", "The National Palace Museum in Taiwan is renowned for its 650,000 treasures, regarded by many as the finest collection of Chinese antiques in the world, many of which were from the Forbidden City, where the emperors resided.", "They formed part of the assets taken to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the civil war to the communists in 1949.", "China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, but relations have improved since Ma Ying-jeou became president of Taiwan last year, paving the way for discussions between Taiwanese and Chinese museum officials.", "Earlier this week the state-owned China Daily newspaper said Beijing would lend portraits of the 18th-century emperor Yongzheng and his concubines for an exhibition in Taiwan.", "But while officials reached several agreements, there was no deal on loans to the mainland, Taipei&apos;s museum director Chou Kung-shin told a press conference on her return to Taiwan yesterday.", "Taiwan fears that China may not return any treasures it sends over, a museum publicist told Reuters."], "title": "Chinese treasures to be reunited in Taiwan", "article": "Chinese imperial treasures kept in Beijing and Taipei are to be temporarily reunited after six decades - but only on one side of the Taiwan strait.

Now it is much less sanguine", "article": "As Hillary Clinton arrives in Beijing today, following her stops in Japan, Indonesia and South Korea, she will be well aware that the Obama administration&apos;s relations with China did not get off to a good start.  Beijing regards Barack Obama as an unknown quantity who, the Chinese suspect, is inclined both to defer to his party&apos;s protectionist instincts and to raise China&apos;s human rights record to uncomfortable public prominence. George W Bush&apos;s presidency, on the other hand, was a pleasure for Beijing to deal with: it distracted itself with two unwinnable wars, leaving China to expand its influence, quietly contrasting Beijing&apos;s peaceful international profile with the US&apos;s embattled one. By playing the bad boy in international climate politics, the Bush administration eased the pressure on China to do more about its own soaring emissions. And in the most active and important aspect of Bush&apos;s China policy, the strategic economic dialogue, set up in 2006 to strengthen ties, the US depended on China first to soak up US debt and then to help manage the consequences of the crisis. Bush&apos;s treasury secretary Henry Paulson made more than 70 trips to China and, in between, there were frequent phone calls. &quot;People have no idea how closely we co-operated with China on the economy and terrorism,&quot; said one Washington insider last week.  In nearly two years of Obama campaigning, on the other hand, China was hardly mentioned. When Timothy Geithner, Obama&apos;s new treasury secretary, accused Beijing of currency manipulation last month, it took a phone call from Obama to Hu Jintao to thaw the resulting frost. It was not the most adroit start to this new phase of the world&apos;s most important bilateral relationship and there was much at stake: not only is China&apos;s economic co-operation necessary, but, if catastrophic climate change is to be avoided, joint action by the two countries that together produce half the world&apos;s greenhouse gas emissions is essential.  A week ago, on the eve of her departure for Asia, Clinton delivered her first major policy speech, appropriately enough, to an invited audience in the Asia Society in New York. For the first time in US history, the new secretary of state&apos;s first outing was not to be across the Atlantic but across the Pacific, a strong signal that the new administration shares Asia&apos;s sense of its current and future importance. For Clinton personally, an early trip was necessary to build her profile. She faced the delicate business of re-balancing the political and the economic relationship with China, despite the fact that the economic crisis continues to dominate both capitals.  Clinton has relatively little room for manoeuvre: the economic relationship must stay on course and that dialogue belongs to the US treasury department. The military dialogue, suspended last November, will shortly resume; diplomatically, the US will continue to need China to keep North Korea in line in the six party talks; cross-straits relationships with Taiwan are stable and improving. The US will continue to rely on Japan as its strategic ally in the region and China will continue to resent it. None of this will change.  There is, though, one area in which Clinton can draw a clear line between the Bush administration&apos;s China policy and the new &quot;smart power&quot; approach: on climate change, the road is clear for an accelerated co-operation between the world&apos;s two biggest emitters that could stimulate a radical, global transformation to low carbon development. In her speech on Friday, Clinton acknowledged the Asia Society&apos;s Orville Schell, who has led a team that, with the Pew Centre on Global Climate Change, spent much of last year working on a road map for US-China co-operation on climate policy and technology. It is one of several informal diplomatic initiatives that have been developed in anticipation of regime change in Washington and which are now vying for the new administration&apos;s endorsement.  The group&apos;s report, released last week, argues that the US and China should use the synergies in their economies to work together on the development of low carbon technologies, especially - for these coal-dependent giants - in carbon capture and storage. Other technical collaboration should include energy efficiency and renewable technologies, advanced electrical grids and data collection, and they pressed for a joint high-level taskforce to be established to take the collaboration forward. The devil may be in the detail, but Clinton left her audience with the impression that she, and the US&apos;s new special envoy on climate change, Todd Stern, were ready to explore these ideas with China. There is a high risk that efforts to reach a global deal on climate in Copenhagen this December will fail, given the tight timetable, and if that happens, the laggard United States would have contributed to that failure. Rapid bilateral deals on the climate with China, though, are easier to implement than a complex international treaty that would need ratification by a still obdurate congress. The US under Obama will stay in the Copenhagen talks, but the US-China forum may be where the action really happens.  isabel.hilton@theguardian.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2009/feb/20/angloamerican-ftse", "publicationDate": "2009-02-20T09:16:33Z", "tags": ["Business", "Anglo American", "FTSE", "Rio Tinto", "Xstrata", "Liberty International", "Land Securities", "Hammerson", "Prudential"], "sentences": ["Prudential shares rose almost 8% to 276.25p after it said the transfer of its operations in Taiwan would boost its capital position by around \u00a3800m."], "title": "Miners give market a major problem", "article": "Mining group Anglo American led the FTSE 100 down more than 100 points this morning, as the blue-chip index crashed through the 4000-point mark.

On a day when Japan&apos;s once all-conquering car exporters reported dramatic falls in output, the world&apos;s second biggest economy could only look to the other side of the Pacific ocean for its salvation. Earlier in the week the prime minister, Taro Aso, urged President Obama, not to retreat into protectionism to kick-start demand, and had won assurances that recovery would be achieved in tandem, or not at all.

They pass through Walsall and on to neighbouring Aldridge where they visit a former foundry that was recently converted - &quot;recycled&quot;, according to its owners - into the country&apos;s largest &quot;materials recovery facility&quot;(MRF, pronounced &quot;merf&quot;).  &quot;We had them here again just a few weeks ago,&quot; says Mick Davis, the business development director at Greenstar, the site&apos;s owners. From a gantry high up above the loud confusion of conveyor belts, thrashing bag splitters and giant spinning magnets below, he points to a towering pile of bales being stacked by a forklift truck in the corner of the hangar-like building. The sweet, acidic stench of rotting refuse attacks the nostrils.  &quot;The inspectors reserve the right to split open any of those bales containing plastic bottles and check for quality and contamination,&quot; says Davis. &quot;They are very fussy about standards. They will also closely inspect our &apos;soft mix&apos; paper bales, too. We now have to take a photograph of every bale before it gets shipped to China. It&apos;s all about traceability and quality control. But it&apos;s their right to be fussy: they pay us good money for these materials. We&apos;re getting about \u00a350 for a 300kg PET [polyethylene terephthalate, a thermoplastic polymer resin] bail at the moment.&quot; This is the vision of recycling we all want to hold dear in our heads as we wash up baked bean cans and sort wine bottles from plastic milk cartons ready for collection: confirmation that as much of our waste as possible is collected, sorted and sold on for a profit. But the reality - somewhat at odds with the evidence to be found in Aldridge - is that recycling is undergoing a crisis of confidence. Amid stories of old televisions being sent for recycling but instead heading for Nigerian landfill sites, and popular revolts against &quot;bin taxes&quot; and fortnightly collections, many householders say they are beginning to lose confidence in a system that has only been in existence for the last decade. (It&apos;s easy to forget that as recently as 2000, as much as 90% of waste in England was still being sent to landfill: in 2008, it stood at 59.9% of household waste.) Compounding this sense of anxiety is the news that the international market for recyclable commodities has taken a dive alongside the rest of the global economy, sparking headlines about piles of unsold recycled materials across the country. And hovering over this are longer-term questions about the direction our waste management strategy is headed, with an increasing push towards incineration as landfill is slowly squeezed out of the equation by ever-tightening environmental directives, regulations and taxes. Would it, in fact, make more sense both environmentally and economically, as one government waste adviser controversially suggested recently, to be burning some of our recycling to generate both electricity and heat instead of, say, exporting it? Inside the warmth of the boardroom, away from the noise and hurry of the machinery, Ian Wakelin, Greenstar&apos;s CEO, offers up a passionate defence of recycling: &quot;Yes, there is a backlash against recycling at the moment, but there is also a real lack of balance in the debate. Is recycling being landfilled, as some are claiming? Beyond the contaminated matter that we have to extract from the recyclate we receive [about 5-10% of the total weight], I think this is nonsense. I haven&apos;t talked to anyone in the recycling industry who has landfilled anything that is recyclable. The economics just don&apos;t stack up. Why would they when landfill gate fees are so high? [Currently, about \u00a350-60 a tonne.] They can give it to me and I will readily take it off them.&quot; Wakelin feels that the UK still has a long way to go before it feels at ease about how it deals with its waste. &quot;We are such a nimby culture here in the UK,&quot; he says. &quot;Would you rather have a landfill or an incinerator on your doorstep? Look at Vienna, where they&apos;ve built an incinerator right in the centre of the city that is so beautiful that it now attracts tourists. The danger is that public perception is bloody difficult to change. We need more positive education programmes about what we do with our waste. For example, it&apos;s immoral not to ship our recycling back to India and China if it&apos;s helping them to grow their economies and develop. Who are we to deny them this resource?&quot; Wakelin believes that one of the tricks to winning over a sceptical public is to make recycling far easier for the average householder. &quot;I always get asked the same questions at dinner parties,&quot; he says. &quot;Why do I have to have so many bins at home? And why can&apos;t I recycle more plastic?&quot;  The solution, says Wakelin, is to &quot;leave it to the machines&quot;, rather than have &quot;Mr and Mrs Average sorting it all at home&quot;. His company&apos;s philosophy for waste is that &quot;co-mingled&quot; collections (where all dry recyclables are placed by householders into just one bag ready for collection) are the way forward, as opposed to kerbside collections (where householders are expected to separate their recycling at home for refuse workers working &quot;kerbside&quot; to then put these sorted materials by hand into separate containers on their vehicle) which, he says, are less efficient, both environmentally and economically. The MRF at Aldridge processes 500-600 tonnes of municipal recycling (collected from households, restaurants, small businesses etc) a day, serving 15 local authorities, some as far away as London and North Wales. This represents 3-4% of the UK&apos;s dry recyclate. &quot;The traditional argument against co-mingled is that it gets more contaminated than kerbside,&quot; he says. &quot;That was the case five to 10 years ago, but the technology is much better now. The industry is going through a revolution right now, from the rag-and-bone man through to the machine. We are seeing a rush by councils towards co-mingling. Nine out of the 10 best-performing local authorities, when it comes to recycling rates, use co-mingled collections. When they switch over, they typically see a 20% leap in recycling rates overnight.&quot; Back out on the shop floor, Davis edges past the 40-strong team of &quot;pickers&quot;, who are all intently scanning the recycling as it flashes past them on the conveyor for any contamination missed by the machines. &quot;We see all this as a commodity, not waste,&quot; he says. &quot;We then process it into soft-mix paper, glass, aluminium, metal cans and soft plastics by polymer type and colour. About 10-15% of our materials go to China, but the majority stays in the UK. All our newsprint, for example, goes to a processing site in Aylesbury.  &quot;Steel cans used to go to the steel firm Corus, but they have currently abandoned this due to the downturn in the car industry. Last year we were getting \u00a360 a tonne for steel, but that&apos;s down to \u00a330-\u00a350. Yes, this has hurt us. But we are tied to the global economy and we think the sharpest shocks are over. People had been running down their stocks of recycled materials, especially in China, but now that they&apos;ve exhausted those supplies they are coming back into the market and prices have strengthened again. It&apos;s a total myth that we can&apos;t sell this stuff. The main problem is that there&apos;s a real shortage of processing facilities like this around the country.&quot; Chris Allen is one of the reprocessors waiting keenly &quot;downstream&quot; for these materials to turn them back into &quot;useful stuff&quot;. As CEO of Smurfit Kappa Paper UK, he oversees a firm that produces 450,000 tonnes of 100% recycled brown paper at two paper mills, in Kent and Birmingham, for use by corrugated box manufacturers across the UK and Ireland. &quot;We turn things such as newspaper, old cardboard boxes and cornflake packets into quality brown paper,&quot; he says. &quot;The UK produces 2m tonnes of cardboard boxes a year. We should do our level best to produce these with locally recycled materials. At the moment, I&apos;m paying \u00a350-55 a tonne for mixed waste paper and card, whereas I&apos;m selling it as brown paper for \u00a3280 a tonne. This is a viable business, believe me. The fibres from those trees that get cut down have a bloody good life.&quot; Allen has strong views about media reports that some local authorities and collection companies have been stockpiling paper, and other sorts of recycling, as market prices have collapsed: &quot;The Chinese buy paper in huge volume and have been outbidding us. They had been buying like hell and paying incredible sums for it. But the downturn caught up with China at the end of last year and they suddenly stopped buying the expensive stuff from far-off Europe. But they are now coming back into the market and we are seeing prices rise again. There&apos;s always been ups and downs in the market, but it was the collection companies who had been exclusively selling to the Chinese that were bleating at the end of last year that the market had collapsed. I hate to say, &apos;I told you so,&apos; but if they had had a balanced supply portfolio they wouldn&apos;t have been in that pickle. The quiet, sensible ones just got on with selling to buyers like me. Look at Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in the country. They didn&apos;t have one single problem, because they sell paper that is well sorted and of a high quality. It&apos;s the shit-quality paper that you saw being stockpiled on the TV.&quot; Tom Freyberg, editor of Recycling and Waste World magazine, agrees there are signs the market is recovering from its trough in December 2008. &quot;Problems started in October when the prices of materials such as paper and plastics fell dramatically,&quot; he says. &quot;However, prices are now climbing. For people to lose faith now in recycling would be disastrous.&quot; But it&apos;s not just the availability of buyers that has helped to depress prices, say some prominent voices within the industry. There is a problem with quality, too. The Campaign for Real Recycling, which is made up of some of the UK&apos;s largest materials reprocessors, in addition to community recycling representatives and Friends of the Earth, argues that the overall quality of recycled materials in the UK just isn&apos;t as high as it should and could be, and that this is largely down to the trend for co-mingled collections. Earlier this year, the campaign group sent an open letter to Jane Kennedy MP, the minister for farming and environment at Defra, urging the government to reverse this trend. It lamented the fact that the recycling system in the UK was producing &quot;extremely low-grade mixed materials masquerading as paper, aluminium, glass&quot; and, as a result, many reprocessors were having to import materials from abroad unnecessarily.  Caught in the middle of this debate is the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap), the not-for-profit company set up as part of the government&apos;s waste strategy published back in 2000. Phillip Ward, as director for local government services, has the task of advising local authorities on what types of collection systems they should opt for.  &quot;We are going through a large transitionary period,&quot; he says. &quot;As recently as 2000 we were largely putting all our stuff in the ground. But we&apos;re now at 35% recycling rates. Local authorities had to invent a new system but no one knew the best way to do it. That&apos;s why we now have a patchwork solution across the country. It&apos;s not a finished system yet.&quot; Yes, he says, we must all aim to produce cleaner, better quality recyclate, as well as aim to &quot;narrow the variations between the local authorities&quot;, but he adds that a patchwork of collection and sorting methods will always be necessary to some degree due to the rural/suburban/urban split across the country. Co-mingling better suits the often cramped &quot;internal logistics&quot; of people living in built-up city centres, whereas kerbside collection suits those out in the leafy suburbs with enough space to sort everything into neat, tidy piles. Psychology plays an important role in public engagement, says Ward. &quot;Surveys have shown that most people have fairly mundane criticisms of recycling: &apos;Nobody explains to me what happens next to my waste&apos;, or &apos;Nobody says thank you for my efforts&apos;. People do respond to this, rather than a punitive atmosphere.&quot; Ward accepts that the media backlash (&quot;propaganda by papers with an agenda,&quot; as he describes it) against &quot;pay-as-you-throw&quot; schemes, which aimed to impose an extra charge on householders who produced excessive waste, means that these are now politically untenable. Give people the right signals, as well as the right collections, he says, and most people are only too happy to &quot;do their bit&quot;. &quot;Our research has shown that giving people two 55-litre boxes for recycling, collected once a week, is the ideal combination. We have also found that if you get plastic recycling right it triggers further engagement. This is now a key area for us, alongside increasing food waste collections. [According to Wrap, we still throw out about one-third of the food we buy.] The next frontier is getting plastic items such as yoghurt pots and margarine lids collected. It has to be shown to be viable. For example, a new plant called Closed Loop has recently opened in Dagenham, Essex, processing plastic milk cartons and clear drinks bottles into food-grade packaging.&quot; But Ward also wants us all to ask some broader, deeper questions about our whole &quot;cradle-to-grave&quot; waste economy. The waste industry has been talking about the so-called &quot;waste hierarchy&quot; for decades - the mantra that places waste prevention as the first goal followed, in descending order, by minimisation, reuse, recycling, energy recovery and, finally, disposal - but it has still not yet fully met these words with deeds. After all, it is now almost 50 years since the US social critic Vance Packard wrote about the excessive waste produced by western consumerism (principally, how we are all encouraged to buy things we don&apos;t need) in his landmark bestseller The Waste Makers - the Silent Spring of the waste world - and still we have yet to fundamentally heed his warnings. &quot;We need a manufacturing system that uses far more recycled materials,&quot; says Ward. &quot;We need to tackle planned obsolescence. At the moment it&apos;s still hard to make the economic case to mend something, but, as we have already seen in places such as Japan and Taiwan, the labour pool in China will become less and less cheap as their standard of living rises. This should lead to the return of the repair man for items such as broken dishwashers, kettles and washing machines. We can do this by getting the manufacturers together. That&apos;s how we tackled standby power. Ten years ago, standby used 25-30 watts; now that&apos;s down to 1-2 watts.&quot; Ask most householders what their No1 irritant is when it comes to waste and the response is immediate: excessive packaging. Why is the onus placed on householders and consumers to dispose of it dutifully and correctly, they ask, when the problem could be more readily tackled upstream? The Local Government Authority also recently weighed into the debate saying that supermarkets should contribute towards the costs of recycling, adding that almost 40% of the packaging used by supermarkets still cannot be easily recycled.  Ward shares this frustration, but he doesn&apos;t have a word of comfort for those who express concern about the slow creep towards incineration as opposed to, say, waste minimisation or greatly increased recycling. &quot;Incineration is going to be inevitable,&quot; says Ward. &quot;[But the] cleaner we can get our waste, the less of it we&apos;ll need to burn. That&apos;s why we always plead for people to keep their recycling as clean and well sorted as possible. Curry sauce all over your recycling will render it useless.&quot; There are those, though, who believe that recovering energy by incinerating waste is better, by and large, than recycling it. The Institute of Mechanical Engineers, for example, has recently urged the government to invest in heating and energy projects with local waste being used as the fuel resource, much like the schemes found in countries such as Germany and Austria. &quot;The government should abandon its focus on recycling as the only way to rid us of landfills,&quot; it says, &quot;as this is quite unachievable and is clearly deceiving the public about what is really happening to their waste. Recycling should only be for waste products that cannot be more sustainably converted into electricity, heat and/or transport fuels.&quot; Adam Read, a former professor of waste management at Northampton University, believes that the industry is still in the foothills when it comes to understanding the full environmental implications of each form of waste treatment. &quot;We certainly need to understand our waste-flow better,&quot; he says. &quot;We need a better grasp of the calorific values, water content, market values and the like of each waste source before pushing ahead. Yes, it sometimes will be more economical to burn waste, but the environmental impact is always going to be less when recycling. However, incineration will always be better environmentally than landfill because of the methane generated when organic waste rots underground.&quot; On the site of a former quarry at Allington in Kent sits a facility that is squarely at the heart of the debate about whether we should be burning more of our waste, especially the portions of our waste that some argue could and should be recovered for recycling. The Enviropower energy from waste (EFW) facility, with its 80m-tall chimney, is the country&apos;s newest and largest incinerator. It also operates a MRF and, as a result, can now claim to be Kent&apos;s one-stop-shop for waste. The Waste Recycling Group, the Spanish-owned company that built the site, says the UK can expect to see more and more combined &quot;waste management facilities&quot; such as Allington Quarry being built in the coming years. &quot;We burn 1,500 tonnes of waste a day - 24/7, 365 days a year - at temperatures of 600-650C,&quot; says Paul Andrews, Enviropower&apos;s managing director, as a huge mechanical claw swoops down, grabs several tonnes of black bin bags from a concrete bunker below, and lifts them up into a shredder in preparation for entering the combustion chambers. &quot;Doing so provides us with 43 megawatts of electricity - easily enough to power the whole of Maidstone.&quot; As much of the recyclable material as possible, he explains, is recovered from the black bins as they pass through the shredders, but this only amounts realistically to any ferrous metals that manage to be caught by magnets. The vast majority of what Kent now puts into its black bin bags - chicken bones, bottle tops, cling film, nappies - ends up being burned inside Allington Quarry&apos;s fluidised-bed combustion chambers (ovens with 120 tonnes of sand at the bottom that is blasted with air to help increase the &quot;burn efficiency&quot; of the materials that pass over it). It&apos;s a one-way ticket, but Enviropower says by burning this waste it helps to divert almost half a million tonnes of Kent&apos;s waste from going to landfill each year. For every black bag that passes into the system, 85% of the weight will be vapourised and the remaining 15% will be extracted, either as an anaerobic sludge or a dry ash. The sludge is sent to landfill, whereas the ash is either landfilled or used as aggregate for roads. But what most of the surrounding residents want to know is what is coming out of that tall chimney. When the site was going through planning, for example, local campaigners opposing its construction said they were fearful of being exposed to soot, heavy metals, PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl) and cancerous dioxins. Paul Andrews makes a pretty remarkable defence when probed on this matter: &quot;It would take 25 years for this facility to produce as much pollution as is emitted by vehicles on the M25 in just three days. The legal limit for dust particles from a coal-fired power station is 160mg per cubic metre, where as for us the limit is 10mg per cubic metre. Proportionally, fireworks throw up far more in the way of dioxins. So does cooking bacon. We have even reached the limit of detection with some of the gases, but we could still go further with nitrogen oxides. The regulations on emissions are incredibly stringent now and, to be honest, we would welcome even tighter rules.&quot; Andrews says that when most people think of incinerators now they think of the ones dating back to the postwar period. But today&apos;s incinerators, he says, are many orders of magnitude cleaner because they go to &quot;extraordinary lengths&quot; to clean up the gases as they leave the combustion chamber, including passing them through a lime and carbon bath to remove the acidic gases and through filter bags to remove dust particles. &quot;We have this Englishman-and-his-castle attitude here in the UK,&quot; he says. &quot;Zero waste is just not possible. We live in a society where some waste streams just don&apos;t have a home other than disposal. As a country, we need to work out where we are ultimately heading with waste. The government needs to set out clearly what our waste vision is.&quot; Recycling as much of our waste as possible is still the goal, says Andrews, but we must accept that some of it will need to be either incinerated or landfilled. But the wider, as yet unanswered, question is what happens when incinerating waste is seen to be more convenient than going to the cost and bother of recycling it? Do we block this from happening with regulation and taxes, as we are doing with landfill, or do we slide into a society that predominately incinerates its waste? The way Liz Parkes, head of waste at the Environment Agency, sees it, we are going through some inevitable growing pains as we move from a nation that once unthinkingly threw its waste in the ground and buried it to one that attempts to make as much use of it as it can. &quot;Yes, it is taking time to turn this around, and it&apos;s a shame that the current debate could turn attitudes away from recycling, but there is a demand out there for our materials,&quot; she says. &quot;We have to keep building up public trust with things such as open days and school visits.

It was also a low-key launch that mainly consisted of updating a web site, without a speech from Steve Jobs or anyone else from Apple&apos;s management. The Mac Mini got the biggest update, partly because it was the most out of date. As rumoured, the new Mini has an Intel Core 2 Duo running at 2.0 or 2.26GHz, an nVidia 9400M integrated graphics chip, and a slow 120GB, 250GB, or 320GB hard drive. It also has have five USB ports and, for reasons unknown, both Mini-DisplayPort and Mini-DVI ports. (But still no Blu-ray drive, and no HDMI port.)The iMac refresh brings faster Core 2 Duo processors (2.66GHz, 2.93GHz, or 3.06GHz), integrated nVidia graphics, and fast hard drives from 320GB to 1TB. All the iMacs have glossy displays, so if you want matt, you&apos;re out of luck. The nVidia graphics chips use shared memory, which is a very good approach for economically priced notebooks. However, you have to go to the 2.93GHz (\u00a31.499) and 3.06GHz (\u00a31,799) 24-inch iMacs to get a real nVidia GeForce or ATI Radeon graphics card.  The Mac Pro gets an upgrade to Intel&apos;s new Nehalem-based quad-core Xeon processors with up to 8GB of memory, and eight-core systems with up to 32GB. All have four FW800 FireWire ports. As my colleague Charles Arthur noted, one with everything maxes out at around \u00a314,000. Apple reckons its new machines are more affordable than before, and in the US, that seems to be true. Whether they will prove to be &quot;more affordable&quot; enough is another matter. The fact is, most buyers won&apos;t pay Apple&apos;s prices, or Sony&apos;s prices, or the high price of Dell&apos;s all-in-ones, so it&apos;s pointless to argue that they&apos;re equivalent or cheaper.  In the UK, things are a little worse, and the BBC&apos;s Rory Cellan-Jones talked of Apple&apos;s &quot;brave&quot; price rise. He says:   From now on, Apple&apos;s entry-level computer, the Mac Mini, which comes without a screen or a keyboard, starts at \u00a3499 - as compared to \u00a3391 before today. The 20in iMac now costs \u00a3949 - the old price was \u00a3782. Right at the top of the range, the brand new 8-core Mac Pro costs \u00a32499, but the quad-core costs \u00a31899, up from \u00a31712.  On Twitter, Ian Betteridge, former editor of MacUser, posted some comparisons, saying: &quot;The closest specced equivalent Dell I can find to the \u00a3649 Mac mini costs... \u00a3379. That&apos;s with a 2.8GHz Core 2 Duo, rather than a 2GHz one. Of course, if you go for the pretty Dell Studio Hybrid, the price is closer - \u00a3598 vs \u00a3649. But at least you have the choice not to.&quot; The problem, says Apple UK, is that the pound has declined against the dollar -- though it might have been more pertinent to know how the Taiwanese and Chinese currencies were doing, since Apple uses Taiwanese suppliers who may assemble machines in China. In the PC market you can easily pick up a notebook or desktop PC for \u00a3250-\u00a3350, or a quad-core tower for \u00a3500. Netbooks are available for \u00a3150 to \u00a3300. They&apos;re assembled in Taiwan or China as well. People who have jobs will still be able to afford Macs, and there are plenty of Mac enthusiasts who aren&apos;t overmuch bothered about the price, but just want the latest systems. But people who want to conserve their cash could either reduce their ambitions or put off purchases until later."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/04/china-boosts-military-spending", "publicationDate": "2009-03-04T15:18:55Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Arms trade", "US news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["&quot;There certainly is a sense of concern in countries like India, Japan, Vietnam, and even Australia about a much more powerful China and what this is going to mean in the future.&quot; US national intelligence director Dennis Blair said last month that China&apos;s military budget increases &quot;pose a greater threat to Taiwan&quot;.", "Although relations have improved, Beijing has warned it would use force to prevent Taiwan moving from de facto to formal independence."], "title": "China announces double-digit military spending boost", "article": "China will boost military spending by 14.9% this year despite the economic slowdown, continuing a run of double-digit increases that have unsettled the US and Asian neighbours. The spokesman for the National People&apos;s Congress \u2013 China&apos;s rubber-stamp parliament, which begins its annual session tomorrow \u2013 told reporters it was a &quot;modest&quot; increase which would increase capabilities and improve conditions for the 2.3 million members of the world&apos;s largest army. Li Zhaoxing said defence spending will reach 480.6bn yuan (\u00a350bn), 62.5bn yuan more than 2008. But the rise is slightly below last year&apos;s 17.6% increase \u2013 and the total is still dwarfed by US military spending. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimates that even when comparative buying power is considered, China spent the equivalent of $140bn (\u00a399bn) in 2007, to America&apos;s $547bn. The UK spent the equivalent of $54bn. SIPRI suggests defence spending in China has risen threefold in real terms over the last decade. Chinese officials argue that heavy investment is needed to modernise its military after years of financial neglect and in the light of other countries&apos; increasing capabilities and China&apos;s growing responsibilities. It has begun contributing to peacekeeping efforts and recently sent ships to join the taskforce battling Somalian pirates. Li said the rise would mainly go towards raising wages and conditions, improving the military&apos;s hi-tech ability and enhancing its emergency response capabilities in &quot;disaster relief, fighting terrorism, maintaining stability and other non-warfare military operations&quot;. The former foreign minister added: &quot;China&apos;s limited military strength is to protect national sovereignty and territorial integrity and would not threaten any country.&quot; A Japanese foreign ministry deputy spokesman, Takeshi Akamatsu, said there were &quot;untransparent points&quot; in the defence budget. Last year a Pentagon report suggested China&apos;s true budget was two to three times the official figure. But Li insisted: &quot;There is no such thing as so-called hidden military expenditure in China.&quot; Rory Medcalf, of the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney, Australia, told Reuters: &quot;It is a bit surprising that they have maintained this level of spending despite the global economic crisis. Fifteen per cent is certainly not modest. &quot;There certainly is a sense of concern in countries like India, Japan, Vietnam, and even Australia about a much more powerful China and what this is going to mean in the future.&quot; US national intelligence director Dennis Blair said last month that China&apos;s military budget increases &quot;pose a greater threat to Taiwan&quot;. Although relations have improved, Beijing has warned it would use force to prevent Taiwan moving from de facto to formal independence. Teng Jianqun, a retired colonel and now deputy secretary general of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, told the Associated Press that spending should go down, but predicted that &quot;the double-digit rate will remain for at least a few years&quot;. China observers are also watching closely this week for details of the 4tn yuan stimulus package announced in November. It aims to boost domestic consumption in the face of slumping exports, largely through spending on public works. A group of respected Communist elders has written to the leadership supporting the plan but warning that corrupt officials could squander the money. &quot;We are very concerned that privileged and corrupt individuals may use this opportunity to enrich themselves, damaging relations between the party and the people and exacerbating social conflicts,&quot; said the letter, obtained by Reuters, and signed by a former secretary to Mao Zedong and other liberal elders. Yan Yiming, a prominent Shanghai lawyer, has also filed two government information disclosure requests demanding more details. China&apos;s growth fell to a seven-year low of 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2008 and analysts say the government will struggle to meet its 8% target this year even with the package. Standard Chartered economist Stephen Green suggested this week could see an announcement of further investment. He said in a report that officials had told him as much as 8tn to 10tn yuan in investment over two years was &quot;possible, if not likely&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/05/newsbytes", "publicationDate": "2009-03-05T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Open source", "Internet", "Computing", "Marcus du Sautoy"], "sentences": ["Tiny Atoms for Taiwan TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor) has signed a deal to make Intel Atom chips for consumer electronics products and industrial devices."], "title": "Newsbytes: March 05 2009", "article": "Open source action The UK minister for digital engagement, Tom Watson, has announced an action plan for open source in public sector IT projects.

The approach to Taiwan built on earlier comments by the Chinses president, Hu Jintao, and omitted last year&apos;s warning that China would never allow anyone to separate Taiwan from &quot;the motherland&quot;. Taiwan broke away when the Kuomintang fled there after losing the civil war to the communists in 1949.

Global markets rose yesterday amid speculation that such an announcement would be made. The boost in expenditure will see the Chinese deficit balloon to its highest level in 60 years, from 0.4% of national income last year to 3% this year. But the 950bn yuan deficit is still small in comparison to other countries, such as the US, where the deficit is more than 12% of income. &quot;The continuous drop in the economic growth rate due to the impact of the global financial crisis has become a major problem affecting the overall situation,&quot; Wen warned. The warning was in stark contrast to last year&apos;s speech, in which he said the main dangers facing the Chinese economy were inflation and overheating. While he has set the same growth target for many years in succession, analysts said the challenge this year would be to hit the 8% figure. In previous years, China has far exceeded it. &quot;Maintaining a certain growth rate for the economy is essential for expanding employment for urban and rural residents, increasing people&apos;s incomes and ensuring social stability,&quot; Wen said.

Sands says: &quot;Pay structures played a role, but to see them as a primary or sole cause of the crisis is a mistake. Things are more complex.&quot; His remarks come in the wake of the furore over rewards for failure in the banking industry and the \u00a3703,000-a-year pension awarded to Sir Fred Goodwin, the former head of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that has been bailed out by the taxpayer. Sands says that while banks and bankers should acknowledge that mistakes were made, many executives lost out in the crash because shares in their own banks collapsed as panic swept the markets. &quot;Dick Fuld [head of failed Lehman Brothers] reinvested his money in the bank&apos;s shares, but that didn&apos;t help him in the end,&quot; says Sands. He acknowledges that excessive leverage by the banks was a big factor in causing the credit crunch, but that other things, such as inadequate regulation and poor oversight, shouldn&apos;t be ignored.  &quot;With huge amounts of liquidity building up in the system during the good years, it was perhaps inevitable that we were storing up problems,&quot; he adds. Sands was one of the few banking executives that the government turned to for advice, when it became clear last year that only a huge public bailout of banks would avert a meltdown. Standard, with its main operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, has avoided the sub-prime debacle and last week reported record annual figures.  On regulation, Sands says: &quot;[Regulators] focused too much on individual institutions, rather than inherent, systemic risk. Basel Two [new banking standards introduced in 2004], had its merits, but concentrated too much on capital rather than liquidity; what kills banks is a lack of liquidity.&quot; Although his bank had little exposure to the housing crash that has brought down HBOS, Bradford &amp; Bingley and Northern Rock in the UK, and countless other institutions in the US, not everything is rosy. Standard&apos;s strong headline profits mask contrasting numbers elsewhere: for instance, bad-debt provisions nearly doubled to $1.32bn in 2008, and Sands admits that life is about to get harder as the Asian export slump brings hardship to corporate customers. &quot;I don&apos;t want to gloss over the challenging economic backdrop,&quot; he says. Last year, Standard launched a \u00a31.8bn rights issue to bolster its balance sheet and hasn&apos;t been entirely unscathed by the turmoil: it took a $116m hit on its Whistlejacket structured investment vehicle in 2007, which was put into receivership a year ago. With its focus on emerging markets, Standard has reaped the benefits of the Asian economic boom that has been driven by spectacular growth in China and, to a lesser extent, India. With operations across the continent, Standard has developed relationships with business people, politicians and officials, that have &quot;stood us in good stead when it comes to managing risk,&quot; says Sands. &quot;Banks get into trouble when they do things they and their customers don&apos;t understand.&quot; But what does the future hold for western banking, when many of Standard&apos;s competitors are now owned by the state? Sands say he doesn&apos;t know, &quot;but I would think that the landscape will change irretrievably. How it will work is pretty uncertain, really&quot;. Standard, meanwhile, is benefitting from the disruption that is affecting rivals, gaining market share as institutions such as Citigroup and AIG, which have been rescued by the US government, come under pressure to reduce their operations overseas and focus instead on their home markets. &quot;Their distractions present an opportunity for us; the competition, in many cases, simply isn&apos;t there.&quot;  A former McKinsey consultant, who previously served as the bank&apos;s finance director, Sands spends half his working life travelling to the far-flung outposts of Standard&apos;s empire, from Taiwan to Seoul, then on to Beijing, Mumbai or South Africa. His parents were born in Asia, so he professes an affinity with the continent, and says he loves jetting around the globe. Now 47, he was educated at a south London comprehensive school, an international school in Canada, then Oxford and Harvard. Sands was headhunted by current chairman Mervyn Davies when he was at McKinsey and Standard was a client. Until the financial crisis, Standard was frequently the target of bid speculation, but Sands says he hardly gave such stories a second&apos;s thought. Temasek, the Singapore government&apos;s wealth fund, is the bank&apos;s biggest shareholder with 19%, but Sands is reluctant to answer a question about whether the fund could increase its stake, or launch a bid. &quot;You&apos;ll have to ask them,&quot; he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/mar/09/apple-netbook-touch-screens", "publicationDate": "2009-03-09T15:07:49Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Technology", "Netbooks"], "sentences": ["DigiTimes in Taiwan says: &quot;Taiwan-based Wintek will supply touch panels for Apple&apos;s new netbook, and shipments will start in the third quarter this year, according to a Chinese-language Commercial Times report.&quot; Further: &quot;Quanta Computer will be the maker of Apple&apos;s new netbook, the Commerical Times report said.&quot; It&apos;s not absolutely clear whether we&apos;re talking about an Apple Newton/Microsoft Origami-style tablet, which might be like a bigger iPod Touch with an ARM Cortex chip, or an Apple eMate/Intel Classmate 2-style netbook with a keyboard and an Intel Atom processor, or something completely different."], "title": "Wintek to supply touch panels for Apple netbook, says paper", "article": "DigiTimes in Taiwan says: &quot;Taiwan-based Wintek will supply touch panels for Apple&apos;s new netbook, and shipments will start in the third quarter this year, according to a Chinese-language Commercial Times report.&quot; Further: &quot;Quanta Computer will be the maker of Apple&apos;s new netbook, the Commerical Times report said.&quot; It&apos;s not absolutely clear whether we&apos;re talking about an Apple Newton/Microsoft Origami-style tablet, which might be like a bigger iPod Touch with an ARM Cortex chip, or an Apple eMate/Intel Classmate 2-style netbook with a keyboard and an Intel Atom processor, or something completely different.

US crew members sprayed the smaller vessels with fire hoses, hoping to keep them away. &quot;[But] the Chinese crew members disrobed to their underwear and continued closing to within 25 feet,&quot; the statement added, in what the Pentagon has described, with some understatement, as a &quot;bizarre&quot; incident. Denny Roy, a US-based expert on Asia-Pacific security, told Reuters the confrontation did not appear accidental. &quot;I don&apos;t think this happened spontaneously ... No doubt it had the endorsement of central leaders in Beijing,&quot; said Roy, of the East-West Centre in Honolulu, Hawaii. &quot;For some years now we&apos;ve seen China sending a signal to the United States that they expect to be accorded a certain amount of respect.&quot; Shi Yinhong, an expert on regional security at Renmin University in Beijing, told Reuters: &quot;The United States is present everywhere on the world&apos;s seas, but these kinds of incidents may grow as China&apos;s naval activities expand ... This reflects the hardening line in Chinese foreign policy and the importance we attach to the strategic value of the South China Sea.&quot; But he added: &quot;Overall, this won&apos;t have a major impact, because financially the United States needs China too much, and China also needs the United States.&quot; The foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, is visiting the US this week for talks ahead of next month&apos;s G20 summit. The incident comes weeks after the two sides agreed to resume military talks that were postponed late last year after a US announcement of arms sales to Taiwan. It has echoes of the 2001 dispute after a US spy plane made an emergency landing on Hainan following a collision with a Chinese fighter jet. People&apos;s Liberation Army commanders have said they are looking to build the country&apos;s first aircraft carrier and the navy last year began its first active deployment outside the Pacific, joining the international fleet battling Somalian pirates in the Gulf of Aden."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/mar/10/china-usa", "publicationDate": "2009-03-10T19:30:00Z", "tags": ["China", "US news", "World news", "US foreign policy", "Hillary Clinton", "Barack Obama", "US politics", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Possible flashpoints include Chinese attempts to thwart a notional American defence of Taiwan, sovereignty disputes over islands in the South China Sea and western Pacific, associated disagreements over oil, gas and seabed mineral exploitation rights, and policing of international sea lanes.", "The two sides recently agreed to resume regular military contacts, broken off last year after Bush sold $6.5bn in arms to Taiwan.", "But Beijing had shown no interest, for example, in a US offer to host military-to-military talks with Taiwan."], "title": "Simon Tisdall: Will US-China relations sink or swim?", "article": "A hosepipe fight between US and Chinese sailors in the South China Sea has put a temporary dampener on the feelgood glow created by secretary of state Hillary Clinton&apos;s recent Beijing visit. China&apos;s foreign ministry angrily accused the Pentagon today of breaking maritime law, distorting the truth, and engaging in &quot;totally unacceptable&quot; behaviour. Chinese military officials went further, hinting that the Impeccable, an unarmed US ocean surveillance vessel intercepted on Sunday off Hainan island by five Chinese ships, was on a spying mission. If so, this would be unsurprising. Among other facilities, Hainan houses a base for China&apos;s ballistic missile submarine fleet. It is an obvious target for US military intelligence-gatherers. In April 2001, a US spy plane was forced down over the island after a mid-air collision with a Chinese fighter. It was George Bush&apos;s first international crisis; he was obliged to write and say sorry. In 2002, another supposedly innocent American survey ship, the Bowditch, got into a similar scrape in the Yellow Sea. Beijing has repeatedly protested US naval incursions into its &quot;exclusive economic zones&quot;, 200-mile nautical no-go areas such as that around Hainan. Washington has not ratified the UN&apos;s 1982 Law of the Sea treaty that created the zones and maintains its ships operate in international waters. It claims to be protecting its commercial interests in busy South China Sea shipping lanes traversed by half the world&apos;s oil tankers. Although world oil prices rose briefly in reaction, the Impeccable incident is hardly on a par with the confrontation between waterborne western imperialists and fanatical Yangtze River nationalists depicted in The Sand Pebbles, the 1966 movie drama starring Steve McQueen. Regional analysts have downplayed its importance, arguing both countries have bigger fish to fry. Clinton certainly devoted considerable energy in Beijing to stressing the need for joint efforts to fight global recession, climate change, and nuclear proliferation. With an uncanny choice of metaphor given recent events, she declared: &quot;We are truly going to rise or fall together. We are in the same boat and thankfully, we are rowing in the same direction.&quot; All the same, this latest spat could serve as a timely reminder of the many fault lines that run through Sino-American relations, which even a post-Bush policy of closer bilateral engagement and co-operation cannot wholly hide. If the Obama administration was in danger of glossing over these points of friction, the Impeccable provided a reality check. Accelerating military competition in the Asia-Pacific region is one major area of concern. China&apos;s latest 14.9% annual increase in military spending, its recently confirmed plans to build aircraft carriers, and its evident intention to project &quot;blue water&quot; naval power eastwards into the Pacific foretell a significant challenge to US dominance by mid-century or earlier. Possible flashpoints include Chinese attempts to thwart a notional American defence of Taiwan, sovereignty disputes over islands in the South China Sea and western Pacific, associated disagreements over oil, gas and seabed mineral exploitation rights, and policing of international sea lanes. The two sides recently agreed to resume regular military contacts, broken off last year after Bush sold $6.5bn in arms to Taiwan. But the agreement, specifically intended to avoid &quot;misunderstandings&quot;, did not prevent the Impeccable incident. Speaking recently, Admiral Timothy Keating, head of US Pacific Command, complained of a continuing lack of transparency and candour on the Chinese side. &quot;It&apos;s our desire to have more exchanges with the Chinese. We want to do more with them,&quot; Keating said. But Beijing had shown no interest, for example, in a US offer to host military-to-military talks with Taiwan. Despite Clinton&apos;s assertion that a strong China could help boost global security, concerns persisted about its military expansion and its development of &quot;area-denial&quot; weapons and anti-satellite and cyber-warfare capabilities, he said. This week&apos;s fierce Chinese crackdown in Tibet, Beijing&apos;s snarling rejection of state department criticism of its human rights record, and its ongoing obduracy on trade and currency issues present additional tripwires for advocates of unconditional engagement. China&apos;s blocking last week of an American move in the UN security council to condemn Sudan&apos;s expulsion of aid workers from Darfur showed how, on some key issues, China, far from rowing together with the US in the same boat, is not even on board. Next month&apos;s G20 summit in London, when Barack Obama and China&apos;s president, Hu Jintao, will discuss co-ordinated action to beat the recession, will be the biggest test yet of a relationship holed below the waterline. It could be sink or swim."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/12/apple-mini-netbook", "publicationDate": "2009-03-12T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Technology", "Netbooks"], "sentences": ["There is a good chance that Apple is producing something, because the Chinese-language Commercial Times has just reported that: &quot;Taiwan-based Wintek will supply touch panels for Apple&apos;s new netbook, and shipments will start in the third quarter this year.&quot; This was picked up by DigiTimes in Taiwan, but it doesn&apos;t tell us much."], "title": "Newly asked questions: Is Apple really going to produce a netbook?", "article": "It&apos;s possible, but sounds unlikely.

Clearly there is a gap between Apple&apos;s small-screen pocketable products, including the iPhone and iPod Touch, and its big-screen portable MacBooks. But if Apple wants to bridge it, it could start from either end. Apple could produce a mini-notebook running Mac OS X on an Intel Atom processor, which would compete with popular models such as the Asus Eee PC range and Acer Aspire One. Or it could produce a tablet computer running OS X (not the Mac version) on an ARM Cortex processor, which would be like a large iPod Touch. The Wintek deal, if the reports are correct, suggests the latter is more likely. Wintek is pioneering what it calls Capacitive Type Touch Panels, with the initial target market being smart phones and handheld games consoles. The company thinks that, over the long term, they will be used in large-screen machines such as netbooks and TVs, but it&apos;s starting small. An ARM-based device may also be considered more likely if it exploits the skills that Apple brought in when it bought a chip firm, PA Semi. On the other hand, touch screens are also the new frontier for the netbook market. Intel&apos;s Classmate 2 reference design is a convertible netbook/tablet PC design with a touch-sensitive screen, and advanced touch features are built into Microsoft Windows 7. There are also plans for devices that have two screens and work like electronic books. If you want to do computing, you turn them around and one screen becomes a touch-sensitive keyboard. The OLPC (One Laptop Per Child) project is developing an XO-2 along these lines, and Asus has shown a similar device in prototype. It&apos;s a market that Apple could pioneer, making its new machine the Nintendo DS of twin-screen netbooks. But I don&apos;t think it will. It&apos;s risky. Although netbooks and touch-screen tablets are becoming popular today, both ideas go back to the 1980s, if not earlier, and have been tried many times before. Apple launched the infamous Newton MessagePad, a touch-screen tablet/PDA, in 1993, and did a small portable netbook version, the eMate, for the education market. Steve Jobs killed them off in 1998, when Apple was in a difficult financial position. In these difficult financial times, a big-screen iPod Touch looks a better bet than a small-screen MacBook, and less likely to undermine sales of Apple&apos;s very profitable portables."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/13/us-china-naval-standoff", "publicationDate": "2009-03-13T11:22:19Z", "tags": ["US news", "China", "US foreign policy", "World news", "US military", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Military ties between the two superpowers were reinstated in February after China froze all exchanges with the US last October in protest at a $6.5bn US arms sale to Taiwan."], "title": "Naval standoff threatens US-China military relations", "article": "Military tensions between the US and China are under threat of escalating after Barack Obama diverted a destroyer to protect a US ship which the Pentagon claims was being harassed by Chinese boats. The heavily armed USS Chung-Hoon is now escorting the US navy surveillance ship Impeccable, which found itself at the centre of a naval standoff in the South China Sea earlier in the week. On Sunday, five Chinese vessels surrounded the unarmed ship amid claims it was on a spying mission in Chinese waters. Pentagon officials said the boats had come within 8 metres (25ft) of the Impeccable, forcing its civilian crew to take emergency action. The Impeccable turned its high-pressure water hoses on the Chinese crew, who then stripped to their underwear as they dropped wood and other debris into the water to block the ship&apos;s progress. Washington lodged formal protests with Beijing after the incident. China rejected the protests, saying the US had provoked the standoff by conducting illegal surveying activities in one of China&apos;s exclusive economic zones. Washington claimed the confrontation happened in international waters. Yesterday, a Pentagon official said: &quot;The USS Chung-Hoon is there, in the area, keeping an eye on Impeccable, which continues its lawful military operations.&quot; The Hawaii-based destroyer, with a crew of about 275, was in the region for a regularly scheduled deployment and was diverted to the escort mission, the official said. &quot;It&apos;s not like we specially deployed another ship,&quot; he said. The arrival of the destroyer underlines the Pentagon&apos;s determination to continue with the surveillance mission, which Beijing claims is to monitor China&apos;s expanding fleet of submarines south of Hainan island. The heightened US-China tensions came as the US president met with the Chinese foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, at the White House. The two leaders called for strengthening co-operation to build &quot;a positive and constructive&quot; relationship, according to a White House statement. Obama stressed &quot;the importance of raising the level and frequency of the US-China military-to-military dialogue in order to avoid future incidents&quot;, the statement said. The national security adviser James Jones raised the incident at an earlier meeting with Yang, according to the statement. Pentagon officials did not say whether such escorts would now be routine for surveillance ships in the area, but they suggested it would continue for the duration of the Impeccable&apos;s current operation. On Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said: &quot;The US claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white, and they are totally unacceptable to China. &quot;We demand that the United States put an immediate stop to related activities and take effective measures to prevent similar acts from happening.&quot; The episode complicates fragile military relations between the US and China, which appeared to have improved after the two held defence talks in Beijing last month. Military ties between the two superpowers were reinstated in February after China froze all exchanges with the US last October in protest at a $6.5bn US arms sale to Taiwan. This is the most serious incident between the two countries since 2001, when a US spy plane collided with a Chinese F-8 jet over the South China sea, killing the fighter pilot. Relations have since thawed and a &quot;hotline&quot; between the Chinese defence ministry and the Pentagon has been established. It was not used during or after Sunday&apos;s standoff."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/14/china-us-economy", "publicationDate": "2009-03-14T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "US economy", "Global recession", "World news", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Underlying frictions persist over Taiwan, China&apos;s military build-up and China&apos;s interests in Africa, particularly Sudan."], "title": "China 'worried' about safety of US assets", "article": "Wen Jiabao, China&apos;s prime minister, issued a veiled warning to America yesterday to maintain control over its economy in the latest sign the global economic crisis is testing the most important bilateral relationship in the world. In forthright remarks on the intertwined nature of US and Chinese finances, Wen told a news conference he was &quot;worried&quot; about Beijing&apos;s holdings of American government debt. Analysts believe China has $1trn (\u00a3716bn) of US treasury bills in its coffers, implying a delicate balance between two powers whose fortunes are interlinked. Speaking at an annual press conference at the end of China&apos;s rubber-stamp parliament, Wen said: &quot;President Obama and his new government have adopted a series of measures to deal with the financial crisis. We have expectations as to the effects of these measures. &quot;We have lent a huge amount of money to the US. Of course we are concerned about the safety of our assets. To be honest, I am definitely a little worried.&quot; In rare comments on another country&apos;s financial health, he added: &quot;I&apos;d like to take this opportunity here to implore the United States ... to honour its words, stay a credible nation and ensure the safety of Chinese assets.&quot; Economists said Beijing was worried Washington would overspend as it tries to get the economy moving, eroding the value of the dollar. Wen&apos;s intervention came as finance ministers and central bankers meet in Britain to lay the groundwork for next month&apos;s G20 summit.  Wen&apos;s comments were the latest in a testy exchange over economic policy, and also followed a naval spat between the two countries as America accused five Chinese ships of harassing one of its surveillance vessels in international waters in the South China Sea. Beijing said the US vessel was operating illegally, but the Pentagon has dispatched a destroyer to the region to protect the American ship. In another potential irritant for relations, the family of one of China&apos;s most prominent dissidents surfaced in America after being spirited out of China. Geng He, wife of Gao Zhisheng, a lawyer whose causes included disgruntled investors and the outlawed Falun Gong sect, made the trip in January, and flew to the US on Tuesday. She paid human traffickers to smuggle her and her two children across south-east Asia by motorbike. China and America have moved in recent years to keep dealings cordial, and relations have improved. They have worked together on international problems such as North Korea and Iran, and America has softened its criticism of China&apos;s human rights record: there was little mention of Tibet in Washington this week during the anniversary of last year&apos;s unrest.  Underlying frictions persist over Taiwan, China&apos;s military build-up and China&apos;s interests in Africa, particularly Sudan. Then there is the economic dimension. There was friction in January when Timothy Geithner, the US treasury secretary, said Obama believed China was manipulating its currency, but the US administration subsequently rowed back. Analysts said Wen&apos;s remarks were a coded message to Washington to exercise caution. &quot;China is telling the US to be careful, not to overspend and keep an eye on the dollar,&quot; Kelvin Lau, regional economist at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong, told the Associated Press. Washington needs to continue selling treasury notes to fund its $787bn stimulus package. Last month Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state, urged China to maintain its stock as she visited the country.  &quot;They are worried about forever rising deficits, which may devalue treasuries by pushing interest rates higher,&quot; JP Morgan economist Frank Gong told Reuters. Beijing is aware that abrupt action would punish the dollar, damaging the value of existing holdings and affecting the sale of goods to its biggest export market. Turning to the wider economic picture, Wen said China would find it difficult, but possible, to reach its 8% growth target. Independent economists suggest the figure could be as low as 5% - enviable to most major economies, but potentially too low to keep unemployment down. China&apos;s authorities are worried about the prospect of millions of laid-off workers returning to the disgruntled provinces."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/26/former-taiwan-president-graft-trial-begins", "publicationDate": "2009-03-26T10:02:41Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan&apos;s former president went on trial amid tight security today accused of multimillion dollar embezzlement, bribery and money laundering while in office.", "Chen Shui-bian, 58, faces life imprisonment if convicted on charges of embezzling 104m New Taiwan dollars (\u00a32m) from a special presidential fund, receiving bribes worth at least \u00a36m in connection with a government land procurement deal, and laundering part of the funds by wiring the money to Swiss bank accounts.", "Millions of Taiwanese have been engrossed by the spectacle of the former leader being accused of the same type of corruption he pledged to eradicate when he first ran for president in 2000.", "Yesterday, her husband&apos;s office released a statement in his name, alleging that all the proceedings against him were part of a deliberate government effort to silence dissent and placate China \u2013 which still sees Taiwan as part of its territory, 60 years after the sides split amid civil war.", "&quot;The judicial system in Taiwan has become a mere tool for political suppression and persecution,&quot; the statement said."], "title": "Former Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian's graft trial begins", "article": "Taiwan&apos;s former president went on trial amid tight security today accused of multimillion dollar embezzlement, bribery and money laundering while in office.

Chen was replaced by Ma last May after serving eight years in office. Arriving at the courthouse from a Taipei detention facility where he has been held since December, Chen looked wan and thin, as dozens of police officers maintained order. Today&apos;s trial follows two months of pretrial hearings to review key elements in the case against Chen, his wife, Wu Shu-chen, their son, daughter-in-law and several aides and associates. Millions of Taiwanese have been engrossed by the spectacle of the former leader being accused of the same type of corruption he pledged to eradicate when he first ran for president in 2000. The charges against him and his wife outline a complex scheme in which Chen allegedly allowed Wu to take bribes from businesspeople seeking political favours. Chen has professed ignorance of those alleged transactions, stressing that the former first lady alone managed millions of dollars in political donations and other funds. On the first day of the trial, expectations about its outcome were mixed. While analysts say much of the pretrial evidence against Chen seems overwhelming, they suggest prosecutors will be hard pressed to present concrete proof to convict him of taking bribes. &quot;There are many grey areas that Chen could use for his defence,&quot; said Huang Chih-hsien, a political commentator. &quot;Unlike America, Hong Kong or Singapore, we cannot convict a politician simply for failing to prove his wealth has come from legitimate means,&quot; Huang said. &quot;The prosecutor must also prove that a deal was struck to hand out political favours in exchange for bribes.&quot; In February, Wu pleaded guilty to accepting a \u00a31.5m political donation in connection with a land purchase deal, but denied that it had been a bribe, as alleged by prosecutors.

The actor Ron Silver, who has died of oesophageal cancer aged 62, was more politically active than most, often becoming associated more with Capitol Hill than Beverly Hills. &quot;I&apos;m an actor by calling but an activist by inclination,&quot; Silver once explained. This side of Silver resulted in his alienating many of his colleagues in the film industry, especially when his views shifted drastically from left to right. Silver was born in New York, the son of Jewish immigrants, in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. His father was an executive in the menswear business, his mother a supply teacher. Working his way through the state school system, Silver finally graduated with a master&apos;s degree in Asian studies at St John&apos;s University in New York and the College of Chinese Culture in Taiwan, with the intention of becoming a China expert for the CIA. Back home, deciding that he had all the attributes to become an actor - dark good looks, piercing eyes, a sonorous speaking voice and few inhibitions - he trained at the Herbert Berghof Studios and the Actors Studio. He began his acting career in the early 1970s on stage in the off-Broadway musical revue El Grande de Coca-Cola (1973). There followed several years in television series, notably in Rhoda, as the eponymous bachelor girl&apos;s shy downstairs neighbour. He made an inauspicious debut on the big screen in the puerile sketch film Tunnel Vision (1976), in which he played Dr Manuel Labor. He then had a small role as a non-English-speaking American footballer in Semi-Tough (1977), and starred as Barbara Hershey&apos;s psychiatrist in the dispensable horror film The Entity (1981). His first decent role came as a union leader in Mike Nichols&apos;s Silkwood (1983), which starred Meryl Streep as a nuclear plant&apos;s whistle-blower. Nichols directed him again on Broadway in David Rabe&apos;s Hollywood satire Hurlyburly (1984-85) and he won a Tony award for his performance as a detestable Hollywood movie producer opposite Madonna in David Mamet&apos;s Speed-the-Plow (1988). He showed a sensitive side as Anne Bancroft&apos;s devoted son in Sidney Lumet&apos;s Garbo Talks, but was suitably slimy as a record producer in Oh, God! You Devil (both 1984) and as the demented and villainous bearded stock exchange trader in Kathryn Bigelow&apos;s Blue Steel (1989), who says: &quot;Death is the greatest kick of all. That&apos;s why they keep it for last.&quot; However, it was Paul Mazursky&apos;s Enemies: A Love Story (1989) that allowed him one of his few romantic roles. In the New York of 1949, Silver plays a Polish Jew who escaped the Holocaust, only to have to juggle his relationships with three women. The role suited Silver&apos;s rather kinetic style of acting, as did his portrayal of Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer who defended Claus von Bulow (Jeremy Irons) against conviction for putting his wife into a coma, in Barbet Schroeder&apos;s Reversal of Fortune (1990). &quot;You have one thing in your favour. Everybody hates you,&quot; says Dershowitz to his client. That phrase could have referred to Silver after he seemed to betray his leftist leanings. Originally a vocal supporter of abortion, gay rights and stem cell research, an environmentalist and anti-nuclear campaigner, he changed his political orientation after 11 September 2001. At the Republican National Convention in 2004, he brought the cheering delegates to their feet by declaring: &quot;The president is doing exactly the right thing, and that is why we need this president at this time.&quot;  After playing the boxing trainer Angelo Dundee in Ali (2001) he landed the role of the political strategist Bruno Gianelli, who moves from the Democrats to the Republicans, in 19 episodes of the liberal-leaning The West Wing (2001-06). He claimed, however, that his backing of George W Bush had lost him acting jobs. &quot;As for those who mock celebrity participation in politics,&quot; Silver said in an 1993 interview, &quot;what do you want us to do? Have affairs? Become drug addicts? We have a certain visibility and power in the society. We&apos;re a celebrity-driven society. Why not use that to try to do a little good?&quot; He was also a keen supporter of Israel.

The member governments are by no means lightweights; as they themselves often remind us, they represent 85% of world production, 80% of world trade and two thirds of the world population. However, these are merely quantitative values and have little to do with legitimacy. For Bangladesh, having a population six times greater than that of Saudi Arabia does not make it part of the group. The only representative from the continent of Africa is South Africa. The institution also lacks logic where money is concerned: Spain, Iran, Taiwan, the Netherlands and Poland have a gross domestic product exceeding that of Saudi Arabia, Argentina and South Africa, but they have not been invited. Other countries of crucial importance for the world&apos;s financial architecture, such as Switzerland with its banking system and the Arab Emirates with its &quot;sovereign wealth fund&quot; assets, are also absent. The 173 countries in the world that have been left out can only wait to see what is decided in London. It could be said that a group of 20 is still better than the G8, which groups the governments of only 14% of the world population, all of which located in the northern hemisphere. It might also be argued that to enlarge the meeting and turn it into a G192, a kind of UN general assembly on a school outing, would make it more representative but pretty useless. The crisis that has hit the financial markets undoubtedly calls for powerful remedies and strong messages \u2013 which can only come from those governments that have fat wallets. But without a proper democratic mandate, are these governments really interested in, or able to, act on behalf of us all? The inability of the G20 to come up with solutions is largely dependent on its institutional nature. In a world that demands greater accountability in world politics it is inconceivable that everyman&apos;s problems should be addressed in summits held outside the confines of democratic logic. When the world markets were still in a state of great euphoria, some visionaries such as Frances Stewart and Sam Daws proposed setting up an economic security council on which the seats are elective and the member countries selected on the basis of their population, income and their capacity to contribute to financial stability. The fundamental difference between this proposal and the G20 is that each government would be empowered to act in the interest of all and not just in the interest of its own country. Now that the crisis has laid low Wall Street and the City, we can only hope that the London summit will discover that the absence of democracy is a luxury we can no longer afford."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/29/bernard-madoff-hsbc-holdings", "publicationDate": "2009-03-29T00:01:00Z", "tags": ["Bernard Madoff", "HSBC", "Business", "US news", "World news", "Hedge funds"], "sentences": ["Fabian Perrone, an Argentinian hedge fund investor, and Chia Hung Kao, who is from Taiwan, filed the complaint in New York last week."], "title": "Madoff victims sue HSBC in US", "article": "British Bank HSBC and accountants Ernst &amp; Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers have been named as defendants in a $3bn class-action suit filed in New York by investors in offshore hedge funds who fell victim to disgraced investor Bernard Madoff.

The reports, published by the universities of Cambridge and Toronto, detail a &quot;murky realm&quot; where cyber spooks infiltrate email, take over humble desktop computers and use them to spy on organisations, individuals and governments. The reports name the system GhostNet, and claim that it has been used to attack governments in south and south-east Asia as well as the offices of the Dalai Lama. In two years, the reports suggest, the operation infiltrated 1,295 computers in 103 countries. While one of the reports remains mute on the identity of the perpetrators, the other has no such qualms, warning that the Chinese government ran a series of cyber attacks on Tibetan exile groups. The Chinese foreign ministry could not be reached for comment. &quot;What Chinese spooks did in 2008, Russian crooks will do in 2010 and even low-budget criminals from less developed countries will follow in due course,&quot; conclude the Cambridge authors of The Snooping Dragon: Social Malware Surveillance of the Tibetan Movement. But the authors of Tracking GhostNet argue that things may not be as they seem in the world of electronic espionage. &quot;We&apos;re a bit more careful about it, knowing the nuance of what happens in the subterranean realms,&quot; said Ronald Deibert from the University of Toronto. &quot;This could well be the CIA or the Russians. It&apos;s a murky realm that we&apos;re lifting the lid on.&quot; The attacks were simple and direct. Infected emails bearing attachments or links to websites were sent to organisations including the private office of the Dalai Lama. Once opened, the virus allowed hackers to operate the host computer, including moving files and sending and receiving data. Their potential control was such that they could turn on an infected computer&apos;s camera and microphone, creating a surveillance bug. The investigations began after Toronto researchers were asked by the Dalai Lama&apos;s offices to examine their computers. Officials had become concerned that communications were being intercepted. The researchers found that computers had been infected by a virus created by malicious software - or malware. That discovery led them to a group of servers on Hainan Island, off China. Other servers they tracked were based in China&apos;s Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region, where intelligence units dealing with Tibetan independence groups are based. &quot;We uncovered real-time evidence of malware that had penetrated Tibetan computer systems, extracting sensitive documents from the private office of the Dalai Lama,&quot; researcher Greg Walton said.  The 10-month investigation also detected bugged computers in the foreign ministries of several countries, including Iran and Indonesia, and in the embassies of India, South Korea, Taiwan, Portugal, Germany and Pakistan. The reports come in the wake of the annual report of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, published in November, which found the computer systems of US government agencies and defence companies had been compromised by Chinese hackers. The Snooping Dragon, produced by two researchers at Cambridge University&apos;s computer laboratory, warns that what they term &quot;social malware surveillance&quot; are likely to spread. Defence, they suggest, is almost impossible.  &quot;Although the attack we describe came from a major government, the techniques their agents used are available even to private individuals and are quite shockingly effective,&quot; they write."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/02/g20-china-world-power-economy", "publicationDate": "2009-04-01T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["China", "G20", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["So long as cross-straits relations with Taiwan can be improved by political and economic means, China - unlike Russia - shows no signs of being a revisionist, let alone an expansionist, power."], "title": "Timothy Garton Ash: China arrives as a world power today - and we should welcome it", "article": "Today - 2 April 2009 - may yet be marked as the day on which, through the catalysis of a global economic crisis, China definitively emerged as a 21st-century world power. Just a few months ago, the talk in western capitals was still about graciously inviting China to join the western club of G7 plus Russia. Now G20 is widely accepted as the new top table of world politics, and China is already seen as one of the biggest players at that table. The question now is: what kind of world power will China be?  Until recently, China&apos;s official policy was of demonstrative modesty - the dragon as gecko. Yes, it sought a &quot;harmonious world&quot;, no less, but China&apos;s best service to that end, it suggested, was its own peaceful domestic development. China was outspoken only on issues that related directly to its own economic development and immediate state interests. Now it seems to be moving gingerly beyond the paradigm of developmental modesty. As, in this crisis, the world asks more of it, so it starts to ask more of the world. The most striking example is a recent article by the country&apos;s central bank governor, suggesting the creation of a supra-sovereign international reserve currency &quot;that is disconnected from individual nations&quot;. In other words, not the US dollar. The idea of extending the IMF model of special drawing rights based on a basket of currencies has been widely mooted - not least by a UN panel headed by Joseph Stiglitz, as outlined recently in these pages. But this idea does acquire a particular complexion when it is China&apos;s central bank governor who suggests toppling the US dollar from its throne. In London yesterday, Gordon Brown and president Hu Jintao discussed giving China more voting weight in the IMF, in return for a larger financial contribution. An eminently reasonable suggestion. This February Xi Jinping, China&apos;s vice-president and heir presumptive to Hu Jintao, sounded off to a Chinese audience in Mexico about rich, powerful countries &quot;messing around&quot; with poorer ones. Now who could he be thinking of? Last year a senior official in China&apos;s defence ministry said the world should not be surprised if China builds its own aircraft carrier. Beijing and Washington have publicly locked horns about the level of Chinese defence spending. At the same time, the Chinese are fascinated by the idea, originally promoted by an American scholar, of a G2 within the G20. China and the United States - this Group of Two - should be to the world what the Franco-German couple used to be to Europe.  China is also investing more in public diplomacy, with nearly 300 Confucius Institutes around the world, increased international broadcasting, and Chinese leaders placing op-ed pieces in western newspapers. &quot;Soft power&quot; is well on the way to becoming a Chinese phrase. So in all three key dimensions of power - economic, military and soft - China is stepping up its game. There&apos;s many a slip twixt cup and lip. China has so far weathered the economic crisis better than America. Millions of suddenly unemployed migrant workers have not yet shaken the system. But bigger tests are still to come. Stephen Roach, a seasoned American observer of the Chinese economy, says it grew in the last quarter of 2008 by &quot;a number very close to zero&quot;, when compared with the previous quarter. In the longer run, the Chinese question of questions remains: can you continue to combine command politics with market economics? Or, to frame it more positively: can you achieve a controlled, step-by-step evolution of this political system into one that is more responsive, transparent, accountable and therefore durable? Let us optimistically assume, for the sake of argument, that China masters these domestic challenges and continues its peaceful rise. What then? What kind of world power would it wish to be? Nobody knows, not even the Chinese. The answer will depend on a generation of leaders not yet in power, and on younger Chinese whose views are scarcely formed. One cannot simply extrapolate forward from the attitudes of older generations seared by memories of colonialism, civil war and the cultural revolution. It seems likely that for the foreseeable future China will continue to put a very high value on unquestioned sovereignty (of the kind most European states no longer practise or preach), on the unity of the motherland (including Tibet), on a many-holds-barred kind of respect (being sensitive to any hint of colonial-style humiliation), and on the requirements of its own economic development. So long as cross-straits relations with Taiwan can be improved by political and economic means, China - unlike Russia - shows no signs of being a revisionist, let alone an expansionist, power. Its current foreign policy style, though often stubborn, is peaceful, cautious, pragmatic and evolutionary.  Beyond this, no one knows how China will behave as a major player in the international system when it is called upon, whether it likes it or not, to speak and act on issues far removed from its domestic concerns. Unlike in the case of the US, Britain or France, China&apos;s history of the last 200 years does not offer a set of foreign policy traditions - such as the Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, Hamiltonian and Wilsonian ones detected in US foreign policy by Walter Russell Mead - that are reference points for future action as a great power. Some analysts, western and Chinese, attempt to reach further back into Chinese history, to the traditions of Confucianism or so-called legalism, to discover buried cultural signposts. Intriguing though this is, the leap is a big one. So it&apos;s a fair guess that Chinese policymakers will make their tradition up as they go along. If Deng Xiaoping&apos;s pragmatic recipe for domestic reform was &quot;crossing the river by feeling for the stones&quot;, China will cross the oceans by testing the water as it goes. This means that a great deal will depend on the welcome it gets from the powers that still set much of the agenda of world politics, especially the United States and the European Union. In short, the process of defining what kind of world power China becomes will be deeply interactive.  What, for example, is the attitude to a more united European foreign policy? &quot;It depends&quot; is the answer I receive here from some of China&apos;s best-informed Europe specialists. It depends above all on Europe&apos;s political attitude to China. That is even truer of the younger generation of China&apos;s elites, eager to study in and learn from the west - before going on to do things their own way.  So the next decade, the 2010s, will be formative. Starting in London today, we in the west should welcome China as a big player and full participant in the liberal international order that has been built since 1945. Far from resisting Chinese requests for a larger voice in international organisations, we should offer it ourselves. Then we should patiently and consistently, across the whole decade, make the argument that the essentials of liberal international order reflect not merely western but rather universal values. That was the claim of the Enlightenment, and I believe it to be true. This will not be easy, especially on the most sensitive issues inside China&apos;s frontiers - but today&apos;s China is full of sharp and open minds. There is still everything to play for. www.timothygartonash.com"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/07/megamouth-shark-rare-fish-endangered", "publicationDate": "2009-04-07T14:26:34Z", "tags": ["Marine life", "Environment", "Conservation", "Wildlife", "Endangered species", "Fishing", "World news", "Animals"], "sentences": ["Others megamouths have been encountered in California, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Brazil, Ecuador, Senegal, South Africa, Mexico and Australia."], "title": "Philippine fishermen net and eat rare megamouth shark", "article": "Fishermen in the Philippines accidentally caught a megamouth shark, one of the rarest fish in the world and later ate it after it had been identified.

The 500kg, four metre megamouth (Megachasma pelagios) died while struggling in the fishermen&apos;s net on 30 March off Burias island in the central Philippines. It was taken to nearby Donsol in Sorsogon province, said Gregg Yan, a spokesman for WWF-Philippines. WWF project manager, Elson Aca, took pictures of the megamouth and tried to dissuade the fishermen from eating it. However, they went against his advice and made a local speciality dish called kinunot - shark meat sauteed in coconut milk. The first megamouth was discovered in Hawaii in 1976, prompting scientists to create a new family and genus of sharks. The discovery was hailed as the marine find of the 20th century, rivalling the discovery of the coelacanth in the 1930s. The megamouths are docile filter-feeders. Their blubbery mouths are almost one metre wide and are lined with a brilliant silver band to attract plankton. Yan said the Burias megamouth&apos;s stomach revealed it had been feeding on shrimp larvae. Yan said the fish was tagged Megamouth 41, the 41st megamouth recorded in the world by the Florida museum of natural history. It was the eighth reported megamouth encountered in Philippine seas. He said the megamouth was caught in waters 200 metres in depth, which are also frequented by the endangered whale shark, the world&apos;s largest fish and also a filter-feeder in the Donsol area, about 185 miles south-east of Manila. &quot;The presence of two of the world&apos;s three filter-feeding sharks warrants special attention for the Donsol-Masbate region,&quot; said Aca. &quot;Whale and megamouth sharks, manta rays, dolphins and other charismatic giants indicate that the region&apos;s ecosystem is still relatively healthy. By protecting megafauna, we help maintain the dynamic balance of our seas and ensure the entire ecosystem&apos;s resilience and natural productivity.&quot; Yan urged fishermen who encounter the rare shark to immediately report to the authorities or the WWF.

It is right that the United States table tennis team should accept China&apos;s invitation to make a tour. But America needs to look at a more serious aspect of its China policy which has become less credible with the passing of time. Some changes have been made. Formosa&apos;s new Foreign Minister recently grumbled that he sensed the US was turning towards a &quot;two China&quot; policy and towards ending opposition to Peking&apos;s membership of the United Nations. It will pay President Nixon to push his policies further in these two directions.  That China should still be technically an international political pariah in spite of having more than 700 million citizens, satellites and deliverable nuclear weapons, is patently both absurd and dangerous. China has now made efforts to take part again in world politics. It deserves to be treated by its fellow nuclear nations and Super Powers as a peer. China might pursue selfish policies if its gestures are not responded to.  The US position has changed. Trade and travel restrictions have been eased. American oil companies operating abroad can bunker vessels travelling to and from the Chinese mainland. These may seem small steps but it is through ping pong balls, oil, and passport stamps that steps towards more rational policies have to be taken. President Nixon showed in his State of the World message that he wanted to draw China &quot;into a constructive relationship with the world community and particularly with the rest of Asia&quot; - but not at the expense of the US&apos;s treaty commitments to Formosa or of its place in the United Nations. At the United Nations the annual game of voting the China question to be &quot;an important question&quot; as a first step to making China&apos;s entry dependent on a two thirds majority will have to stop. Last November China obtained an ineligible majority for the first time. The US now concentrates its efforts on ensuring that Formosa stays in the organisation. Officially neither Formosa nor China can abide sitting under the same diplomatic roof. But China, to obtain recognition, has been ignoring this. And the gamble has paid off. Acceptance of a &quot;two China&quot; policy would mean that both would be in the mainstream of world politics. Peking&apos;s control over the mainland would be unchallenged and Formosa&apos;s mainland pretentions curbed. If China is interested in advancing relations with the US it should avoid threats to regain the province of Taiwan. In the long run good relations depend on the outcome of Vietnam.

The news sparked a stockmarket rally and sent the benchmark Nikkei index in Tokyo soaring by 3.7% to 8916.06. Shares in Seoul and Taiwan jumped by more than 4%. Shares in Toyota, maker of the Prius hybrid, rose 4.3%, while those of Sharp, the world&apos;s second-largest maker of solar cells, surged 10.7%. The measures \u2013 equivalent to 3% of the country&apos;s GDP \u2013 were approved by the ruling Liberal Democratic party&apos;s executive council. The proposal is expected to get the green light from the government tomorrow. The prime minister wanted new government spending to exceed 2% of GDP because of &quot;the extent of the fall in Japanese economic output recently, which is larger than other advanced economies, and also given the need for international co-operation to revive the world economy&quot;. Japan has slipped further into recession this year as global demand for its cars and electronics has plunged. The package is designed to help contract workers and small businesses with tax cuts and credit guarantees; boost regional economies; expand green technologies, and support elderly care. The government also said it would implement &quot;bold&quot; reforms and direct public and private-sector investment into three areas of focus: creating the world&apos;s leading low-carbon society; strengthening nursing and medical services, and boosting tourism and cultural activities, including the arts. It will also encourage the start of mass production of electric cars in three years and boost solar power generation to 20 times the current level of 1.42m kilowatts. The government also plans to subsidise salaries of workers at nursing homes, aiming to create 300,000 jobs in the next three years, to add to the current 1.3m. The stimulus package also includes a car scrappage scheme similar to the &quot;cash for clunkers&quot; programme being debated in the US Congress. Japan, home to several of the world&apos;s biggest carmakers, is considering giving \u00a5250,000 to consumers who trade in a car 13 years or older for a more fuel-efficient model. Such schemes already exist in a dozen European countries and have boosted car sales. Britain&apos;s ailing motor industry has called on the government to introduce a similar incentive in this month&apos;s budget. Last month, Japan&apos;s parliament passed a record \u00a588.5tn budget for the new fiscal year, which started on 1 April, including parts of Aso&apos;s two previous stimulus packages. Officials have not said where they would find the extra money, though Aso recently said he would turn to issuing bonds if needed.

I&apos;m told the figure is &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot;, as such figures often are. Either way it isn&apos;t the fact that the former prime minister can command large sums for speaking engagements. If rich people want to shell out to hear him, that&apos;s their business. No, it was the idea that he was doing it in the Philippines which got to me. I know the place a little \u2013 just a few of its 7,000 islands \u2013 having covered the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos there in 1986 for the Guardian. I had my pocket picked as I battled my way through the crowd squeezing into Manila&apos;s Malacanang Palace to inspect Imelda&apos;s shoe collection: 600 pairs, no less. I never got to see any of them. Friendly people Filipinos, but also poor people whose pockets have been picked long and hard by their own elite. Always coy about his earnings \u2013 reportedly \u00a315m since leaving office, what with books, banking and blagging \u2013 Blair&apos;s people tell me the reported fees for his 36-hour visit to Manila was &quot;greatly exaggerated&quot;, which apparently means they were less than half what appeared in the press. Good, but it&apos;s still too much money for a well-heeled European to take out of one of Asia&apos;s poorer countries. The Sunday Times claims that TB is now commanding more than Bill Clinton; surprising if true. Back in the early 1950s the Philippines was widely expected to become the first of the Asian tiger economies, smaller states following Japan&apos;s developmental lead. Instead, it fell to a kleptocracy under Marcos, leaving South Korea and Taiwan to become South Korea and Taiwan. Since there are repeated hints that Blair is still interested in becoming the EU&apos;s first full-time president (two terms totalling five years is the proposed maximum) he may be busy trying to make hay while he can, although the Europe job is not penury either. I remain sceptical either that he really wants to do the job or that EU comrades would have such a skilful grandstander who might put their own lights into relative darkness. In any case, the small matter of ratification of the Lisbon Treaty by Ireland (and several others) lies between Blair and any such hope. Why has he been popping up in Britain this week, I wonder? No change in his plans, just coincidence, Blair aides insist (he&apos;s not planning a comeback). Blair is being interviewed about his faith on Radio 3 at 11 tonight, by classy Joan Bakewell, too. He also gave an interview to Attitude magazine which generated some ink. That was because Blair appeared to be lecturing his spiritual guide, Pope Benedict XVI, on the need to rethink his &quot;entrenched&quot; hostility to homosexuality. Most Catholics no longer feel that way about gay people, the new Catholic convert breezily explained. Apparently Pope Benny (TB refers only to the Catholic &quot;leadership&quot;) does view such things as saving the world from homosexual misbehaviour as being as important as saving the rainforests. But Pope Tony&apos;s magnificent self-confidence is comic, too, in its way as he thunders against an over-literal interpretation of the Old Testament, one unfit for the 21st century (&quot;hordes of concubines and so on&quot;). Blair told Attitude that organised religion is a bit like politics when facing change: &quot;You can either hold to your core vote or you can say &apos;Let&apos;s accept that the world is changing&apos; and work out that we can lead that change.&quot; So there.

The manga genre encompasses every possible theme, from tales involving lovable characters for children, to historical and political themes, sports and pornography. Many of the most popular titles are turned into hit TV series and films. Sazae-san, a comic strip about a typical Tokyo family that first appeared in 1946, moved to the small screen in 1969 to become the longest-running animated programme of all time. It still airs every Sunday evening. &quot;Manga used to be regarded as something for children until they were around 15,&quot; manga critic Haruyuki Nakano told Kyodo News last month on the 50th anniversary of two of Japan&apos;s pioneering weekly manga titles. &quot;But baby boomers in postwar Japan kept reading their favorite manga even after they entered college and became adults. That helped make manga widespread in Japanese culture,&quot; Nakano said. While translated Japanese manga are proving popular in the US market, sales at home have been hit by the spread of game consoles and online comics, and the dramatic growth of titles that can be read on mobile phone handsets.

The rebellion was crushed. The Dalai Lama fled to India, and for at least a decade things became a lot worse. Many Tibetans, possibly more than a million, starved to death during Chairman Mao&apos;s Great Leap Forward campaign. Temples and monasteries were smashed, sometimes by Tibetan Red Guards, during the Cultural Revolution, and a large number of people died in the violence. Chinese officials are noticeably jumpy in this year of anniversaries (20 years after the Tiananmen Square protests). Last month I was in Chengdu, in Sichuan province, where many Tibetans live. Even foreign tourists who had no clue about the anniversary were stopped in the streets by police looking for signs of rebellion. The colourful Tibetan district was cordoned off. Not only was it forbidden to take pictures there; one couldn&apos;t even walk through. The Chinese press, however, marked the anniversary with effusive articles describing Tibetan joy at being liberated from centuries of feudalism and slavery. If the China Daily, among other publications, is to be believed, &quot;pre-Liberation&quot; Tibet was a living hell, and Tibetans are now grateful to be citizens of the People&apos;s Republic of China. Some probably are. Many are not. But if Chinese propaganda paints too dark a picture of the Tibetan past, westerners who sympathise with the Tibetan cause are often too sentimental. The personal charm of the Dalai Lama has promoted a caricature of a mystical, wise and peace-loving people being crushed by a brutal empire. It was not for nothing, however, that quite a few educated Tibetans actually welcomed the Chinese communists in 1950. The Buddhist clergy was seen, not without reason, as hidebound and oppressive. Chinese communism promised modernisation. And that is what China&apos;s government has delivered in the past few decades. Lhasa, a sleepy, rather grubby backwater only 30 years ago, is now a city of huge public squares, shopping centres, and high-rise buildings, connected to the rest of China by a high-speed railway line. It is true that Tibetans, sparsely represented in local government, may not have benefited as much as the Han Chinese, whose presence in cities such as Lhasa as soldiers, traders and prostitutes is so overwhelming that people worry about the extinction of Tibetan culture, except as a tourist attraction. Still, there is no question that Tibetan towns are now more modern \u2013 in terms of electrification, education, hospitals, and other public facilities \u2013 than they were before. This is one of the arguments used not only by Chinese officials, but by almost all Chinese, to justify Tibet&apos;s absorption into greater China. This argument has a long history. Western (and, indeed, Japanese) imperialists used it in the early 20th century to justify their &quot;missions&quot; to &quot;civilise&quot; or &quot;modernise&quot; the natives. Taiwan, under Japanese rule, was in fact more modern than other parts of China. And the British brought modern administration, as well as railways, universities, and hospitals, to India. Outside a fringe of nostalgic chauvinists, however, most Europeans and Japanese are no longer so convinced that modernisation is sufficient validation of imperial rule. Modernisation should be carried out by self-governing people, not imposed by foreign force.  But the Chinese have another argument up their sleeve, which seems more plausible (and more modern). They are justly proud of the ethnic diversity of China. Why should nationality be defined by language or ethnicity? If Tibetans should be allowed to break away from China, why not the Welsh from Britain, the Basques from Spain, the Kurds from Turkey, or the Kashmiris from India? In some cases, the answer might be: well, perhaps they should. But ethnicity as the main marker of nationality is a vague and dangerous concept, not least because it leaves all minorities out in the cold. So are people wrong to support the Tibetan cause? Should we dismiss it as sentimental nonsense? Not necessarily. The issue is not so much Tibetan culture, or spirituality, or even national independence, but political consent. In this respect, the Tibetans are no worse off than other citizens of the People&apos;s Republic of China. Historic monuments are being bulldozed everywhere in China in the name of development. Culture is being sterilised, homogenised and deprived of independence and spontaneity in all Chinese cities, not just in Tibet. No Chinese citizen, regardless of whether he or she is Han, Tibetan, Uighur or Mongolian, can vote the ruling party out of power. The problem, then, is not mainly one of nationality or discrimination, but of politics. The Chinese government claims that Tibetans are happy. But without a free press and the right to vote, there is no way of knowing this. Sporadic acts of collective violence, followed by equally violent oppression, suggest that many are not. Without democratic reform there will be no end to this cycle, for violence is the typical expression of people without free speech. This is true not only for Tibet, but also for the rest of China. Tibetans will be free only when all Chinese are free. In that sense, if in no other, all citizens of China hang together. \u2022 Ian Buruma&apos;s latest book is The China Lover.

Those, especially over-50s, who consume a lot of soy can &quot;significantly&quot; cut their risk of developing the disease, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.  Researchers who studied the diet and health of 68,412 women aged 40-70 in Shanghai concluded: &quot;After adjustment for age, birth calendar year and total energy intake, consumption of soy foods was significantly associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. We found that risk of colorectal cancer decreased with increasing soy food intake, primarily among postmenopausal women.  &quot;The risk decreased more than 30% among women who were in the top tertile [third] of soy food intake compared with women in the bottom tertile of soy food intake,&quot; said the authors, from the Vanderbilt University school of medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, led by Gong Yang.  Bowel cancer is the second most lethal form of the disease affecting women in the UK after breast cancer, killing 16,600 each year and accounting for just over one in 10 of all cases of cancer among females, according to Cancer Research UK figures.  The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF), global experts in preventing the disease, said the results were exciting. Dr Panagiota Mitrou, its science programme manager, said: &quot;These findings are exciting because this is a well designed study carried out where a lot of soy food is eaten and it is consumed at different levels. This means it is a good place to find out how soy affects cancer risk. The study shows that the risk of bowel cancer is decreased with increasing soy intake and this is especially the case for postmenopausal women.&quot;  The findings may help explain why many fewer people in countries such as China and Japan, where soy is a staple part of the diet, develop bowel cancer compared with Western countries, where soy consumption is low. Soybeans are eaten whole boiled with salt, while soya is widely used, for example as an alternative to dairy produce in products such as milk, yogurt and cream cheese. There is also a niche market in soy supplements for those convinced of its healthy properties. It has also been credited with helping to reduce levels of cholesterol.  However, the WCRF would like to see the findings repeated among non-Asian women, who have a different genetic background and different lifestyles from those in the study, before it could give any public health advice based on the new research, added Mitrou. &quot;If we were able to repeat these findings in this country, it would mean that including things like tofu and soya beans in their diet would be something positive that women could do to reduce their risk of bowel cancer.&quot;  The best ways to prevent cancer were to eat a plant-based diet without much salt or alcohol, be physically active and maintain a healthy weight, she added.  Separate research last week, in the journal Nutrition and Metabolism, suggested that soybean chemicals called soy aglycons of isoflavone may help reduce the effects of the menopause. The researchers, from Taiwan, said dietary soy supplementation could ultimately prove to be an effective alternative to hormone replacement therapy, which has been linked to increased cancer risk."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/16/youchoose", "publicationDate": "2009-04-15T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Internet", "Technology", "YouTube", "Mobile phones", "Robots"], "sentences": ["Elan gives iPhone the eFinger     Touchscreen for YouChoose Photograph: YouTube    Taiwan&apos;s Elan Microelectronics shows how to do a multi-touch phone, with its eFinger system running on Google Android."], "title": "YouChoose: Online Easter egg hunt, how to do a multi-touch phone and a new obsession", "article": "Show me the bunny, honey     Egghunt for YouChoose Photograph: YouTube    We know Easter is over, but this was simply too clever to resist - an online, interactive, Easter egg hunt.

Wild said cycling had become more popular because of concerns about health and the environment as well as the recession: &quot;The first two reasons will be relevant whatever happens to the economy, although that is particularly important today.&quot; The strong bike market helped Halfords beat City expectations with profits of \u00a392m in the financial year just ended. It said like-for-like sales in its leisure departments, which include bikes and accounts for a third of sales, were positive in the quarter but down 3.8% overall. Much of the dip was down to falling demand for gadgets such as satnavs, as motorists were forced to spend money on essential maintenance or decided to switch to two wheels. In recent years Halfords&apos; margins on satnavs were being squeezed in a competitive market place, but Wild said price deflation had slowed as European manufacturers such as TomTom, which imports from Taiwan, juggle buying in dollars and selling in pounds. Sam Hart, an analyst at Charles Stanley, warned the depreciation of sterling could become a bigger issue further down the line as many Halfords&apos; products were sourced in dollars. Despite the surge in popularity of cycling, Halfords has abandoned plans to open a chain of bike shops aimed at the high end of the market."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/china-taiwan-asia-boao", "publicationDate": "2009-04-16T19:00:01Z", "tags": ["China", "International trade", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Indeed, it was at last year&apos;s Boao Forum that the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, began to express public optimism about the positive trends in mainland China-Taiwan relations.", "That rapprochement was possible because Taiwan&apos;s then newly elected vice-president, Vincent Siew, was given permission by China to attend the forum, where he was able to meet Hu informally.", "That mission&apos;s highlight was my dialogue with the Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, who stressed the importance of connecting Taiwan to the China-Asean Free Trade Area (pdf) (Cafta) in the light of warmer relations developing between the mainland and Taiwan.", "At this time of economic turmoil around the world, increasing Taiwan&apos;s formal economic links with China and its regional partners can only benefit everyone involved, because an inevitable side-effect will be a lessening of tension.", "Unfortunately, some analysts suggest that a Taiwan-Asean free trade agreement of the likes of Cafta may not yet be possible, so, in the interim, Ma&apos;s administration is striving to achieve separate free trade agreements with various Asean members.", "Understandably, the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) has taken the stand that Taiwan should seek closer ties with Asean countries rather than depend too much on mainland China, but Ma does not see the two efforts as being mutually exclusive.", "From a wider perspective, Ma and I exchanged views on the synergy of an emerging &quot;Central East Asia Growth Polygon&quot; (Ceagpol) consisting of the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian \u2013 plus, eventually, Hainan, Okinawa, and Guam/Marianas.", "An economic bonus of such an effort for the entire region would come from the opening of direct flights and sea transport across the Taiwan Strait.", "The easing of tensions between China and Taiwan can, perhaps, set a tone for all of north-east Asia.", "At the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Message to Compatriots in Taiwan&quot; last January, Hu offered six proposals to improve relations: 1) Abandon the Taiwan independence movement 2) Stop confrontation and reach peaceful agreements 3) Increase military contacts/exchanges 4) Discuss Taiwan&apos;s participation in international organisations under the &quot;One China&quot; umbrella 5) Establish a Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement (Ceca) 6) Promote China&apos;s traditional civilisation with strengthened spiritual ties There is now real hope that talks along these lines can succeed.", "But there is a major obstacle to easing tensions: the proposed $6.5bn sale by the US to Taiwan of 30 Apache attack helicopters and 330 Patriot missiles.", "All three parties involved will need to tread with care to make certain that the thaw in China-Taiwan relations is not set back by this proposed arms deal.", "For if Asia is to begin to build the type of dense institutional infrastructure that has brought Europe peace and prosperity, the flashpoint between China and Taiwan will need to be transformed into a foundation stone of regional co-operation."], "title": "Fidel V Ramos: Asian nations must unite at the Boao Forum", "article": "China&apos;s government has just announced that Premier Wen Jiabao will be the main speaker at the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia, where the roster of leaders expected to participate is a virtual Who&apos;s Who of the continent: Asif Ali Zardari, president of Pakistan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of Kazakhstan, Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, president of Togo, Sanjaagiin Bayar, prime minister of Mongolia, Thein Sein, prime minister of Burma, Nguyen Tan Dung, prime minister of Vietnam, John Key, prime minister of New Zealand and Kopsak Saphawasu, the deputy prime minister of Thailand. Such meetings are vital for Asia, because the continent lacks the dense institutional infrastructure that Europe has built up over the past five decades. This year&apos;s Boao Forum has become even more important because of the cancellation of the East Asia Summit due to the action of violent protesters. Multinational companies increasingly treat Asia as a single economic space, at least as far as production is concerned. This, of course, does not mean that Asia is, or is becoming, a single market, but rather a tight-knit pan-national supply chain. But although Asia is becoming more like Europe in terms of economic integration, political and diplomatic integration lags behind. So because Asia lacks such institutional arrangements, personal diplomacy of the type that the Boao Forum represents, like the annual global winter gathering at Davos, remains vitally important. Indeed, it was at last year&apos;s Boao Forum that the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, began to express public optimism about the positive trends in mainland China-Taiwan relations. That rapprochement was possible because Taiwan&apos;s then newly elected vice-president, Vincent Siew, was given permission by China to attend the forum, where he was able to meet Hu informally. Last February, I headed a 40-member trade delegation to Taipei. That mission&apos;s highlight was my dialogue with the Taiwanese president, Ma Ying-jeou, who stressed the importance of connecting Taiwan to the China-Asean Free Trade Area (pdf) (Cafta) in the light of warmer relations developing between the mainland and Taiwan. At this time of economic turmoil around the world, increasing Taiwan&apos;s formal economic links with China and its regional partners can only benefit everyone involved, because an inevitable side-effect will be a lessening of tension. Unfortunately, some analysts suggest that a Taiwan-Asean free trade agreement of the likes of Cafta may not yet be possible, so, in the interim, Ma&apos;s administration is striving to achieve separate free trade agreements with various Asean members. Understandably, the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP) has taken the stand that Taiwan should seek closer ties with Asean countries rather than depend too much on mainland China, but Ma does not see the two efforts as being mutually exclusive. From a wider perspective, Ma and I exchanged views on the synergy of an emerging &quot;Central East Asia Growth Polygon&quot; (Ceagpol) consisting of the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and the mainland Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Fujian \u2013 plus, eventually, Hainan, Okinawa, and Guam/Marianas. With goodwill on all sides, real advantages can materialise from building up this informal grouping, as it is a gateway to the huge markets of south-east and north-east Asia. An economic bonus of such an effort for the entire region would come from the opening of direct flights and sea transport across the Taiwan Strait. Ceagpol could even become a building block for a north-east Asian version of Asean \u2013 an &quot;association of north-east Asian nations&quot;. As a result of historical suspicion between China, Japan and Korea, north-east Asia&apos;s economic heavyweights form the world&apos;s last remaining regional bloc to still lack an inter-governmental organisation of the likes of Asean. The European Union is even more instructive, because centuries of war, culminating in the two world wars of the 20th century, inspired, rather than deterred, European economic, political and security integration. At this time of worldwide uncertainty, Asia-Pacific leaders must redouble their efforts to exploit their partnerships and strategic combinations to foster stability and growth. The easing of tensions between China and Taiwan can, perhaps, set a tone for all of north-east Asia. At the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Message to Compatriots in Taiwan&quot; last January, Hu offered six proposals to improve relations: 1) Abandon the Taiwan independence movement 2) Stop confrontation and reach peaceful agreements 3) Increase military contacts/exchanges 4) Discuss Taiwan&apos;s participation in international organisations under the &quot;One China&quot; umbrella 5) Establish a Comprehensive Economic Co-operation Agreement (Ceca) 6) Promote China&apos;s traditional civilisation with strengthened spiritual ties There is now real hope that talks along these lines can succeed. But there is a major obstacle to easing tensions: the proposed $6.5bn sale by the US to Taiwan of 30 Apache attack helicopters and 330 Patriot missiles. China-US talks on defence co-operation had stalled because of such arms negotiations. They have since been restarted, an olive branch sent to the Obama administration by China&apos;s government. All three parties involved will need to tread with care to make certain that the thaw in China-Taiwan relations is not set back by this proposed arms deal. For if Asia is to begin to build the type of dense institutional infrastructure that has brought Europe peace and prosperity, the flashpoint between China and Taiwan will need to be transformed into a foundation stone of regional co-operation.

Surrounded by mountains on three sides and volatile open sea on the other, and fed by the pristine waters of a fast-flowing river, it is the stuff of distillers&apos; dreams. The Highlands of Scotland, though, lie thousands of miles to the west: the home of the best single malt whisky in the world is Yoichi, until last year a little known town on Japan&apos;s northernmost island of Hokkaido. Its rise to the pinnacle of the centuries-old tradition of turning barley into &quot;the water of life&quot; was enough to make any proud Scotsman weep into his tumbler of Glenfiddich. Not only did Nikka&apos;s Yoichi 1987 vintage beat dozens of other labels to claim the single malt title at last year&apos;s world whisky awards - in Glasgow of all places - its rival distiller, Suntory, won the best blended whisky award with its 30-year-old Hibiki. Today, as expert tasters meeting in London prepare to name this year&apos;s winners, Suntory and Nikka, Japan&apos;s two biggest distillers, are again preparing to ruffle a few traditionalist feathers. &quot;We were very surprised to win the award,&quot; said Masatoshi Takeuchi, a spokesman at Yoichi, which still uses coal fires to heat its pot stills, a labour-intensive method most Scottish makers have discarded. &quot;It has definitely helped create a new breed of Japanese whisky fan. And the most ardent converts don&apos;t care about the price.&quot;  Though Japanese interest in single malts has undergone a dramatic transformation since the days when salarymen swilled glasses of cheap blended concoctions - liberally diluted with water and ice - the growing popularity of wine and shochu, a fiery Japanese spirit, is forcing distillers to court new markets. Whisky sales in Japan have fallen 75% since the bubble-era peak of the early 1980s, while exports have accounted for only a tiny percentage of total production. But the cachet that comes with recognition at international tastings and competitions has transformed Japanese whisky from laughing stock to serious contender for the affections of imbibers from Tokyo to Tulloch. Nikka is targeting the emerging markets of Sweden and France, while Suntory is about to launch an overseas promotion driven by its 86-year-old distillery in Yamazaki, on the outskirts of Kyoto. &quot;We want to sell in overseas markets where drinkers are looking for something real, but different,&quot; said Keita Minari, global marketing manager at the Yamazaki distillery. &quot;First timers are sceptical, but once they&apos;ve tried our whisky we find that they are always pleasantly surprised.&quot;  The Yamazaki distillery shipped 1,500 cases overseas in 2003, the year its 12-year-old single malt won the gold medal at the International Spirits Challenge. A slew of awards since then has driven annual shipments up to 20,000 cases, with sales to China and Taiwan now rivalling those to the US. Yamazaki has selected the UK to launch a 12-year-old Hibiki blend next month in an attempt to steal market share from the likes of Johnny Walker and Chivas Regal. Consumers in Japan will have to wait until September. Tastings in Britain have generated a fantastic response, according to Minari: in a recent promotion at Heathrow&apos;s Terminal 5, 1,000 bottles of Yamazaki single malt sold out in a month. While Scottish distilleries are free to buy in whiskies from other makers to orchestrate the desired blend, their Japanese counterparts do everything in-house. This arrangement, with a variable climate and reverence for traditional distilling methods, is turning this relative newcomer into a whisky powerhouse. Suntory, which controls 70% of the domestic market, has more than 100 types of unblended whisky at its disposal.  &quot;Although some Japanese people are the last to believe in the quality of their own products, their malt whiskies are as good as any in the world,&quot; said Chris Bunting, an expatriate Yorkshireman who blogs about the country&apos;s whisky at Nonjatta.  &quot;No one can say that Japan isn&apos;t making the genuine article.&quot; Man behind the malt Suntory and Nikka have Masataka Taketsuru to thank for their success. He fell in love with whisky while studying chemistry at Glasgow University in 1918, trained as a blender in Campbelltown and Speyside, then returned to Japan. Taketsuru was headhunted by Suntory&apos;s founder, Shinjiro Torii, to launch the firm&apos;s Yamazaki distillery in 1923. Ten years later he and his Scottish wife, Rita, opened the Yoichi distillery. He died, aged 85, in 1979."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/24/last-nights-tv-review", "publicationDate": "2009-04-23T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Television", "Television industry", "Media", "Culture", "Channel 4", "Television & radio"], "sentences": ["Someone in Taiwan makes him a sort of offer, but then retracts it because he thought he was only doing it for the cameras.", "In this episode he has hung out with jade carvers, had a stall in a Taiwan market, met the dodgiest tea trader in Hong Kong, caught a few fish in Japan and sold them at market."], "title": "Sam Wollaston on last night's TV: Around the World in 80 Trades", "article": "People like to do different things when they go on holiday abroad. My mum, for example, likes to look at Augustinian churches. So her take on a place is largely informed by what was going on there about 800 years ago. My girlfriend likes to do what her Lonely Planet tells her to do, so her experience of a country is meeting people like herself, also with Lonely Planets, in front of well-known world heritage sites, or eating banana pancakes. I like to go to football matches, so to me every country is the same - full of foul-mouthed men who jump up and down and sing badly. All three are fine - a holiday is, after all, about doing what you want. But they have their flaws when it comes to getting an idea of what somewhere is actually like. For that, Conor Woodman&apos;s approach to travel is infinitely preferable. Conor&apos;s the guy in Around the World in 80 Trades (Channel 4). When he goes somewhere he likes to make money. Well, he tries to. He&apos;s reached the Far East now, and he&apos;s in the black after some successful business involving chilli sauce and wine. The camels and horses were less successful - that thing about never working with animals goes for international trade as well. Children too, but that&apos;s also illegal. Of course, if Conor really wanted to make serious money he&apos;d get involved in trafficking people, arms or drugs, but for now he&apos;s staying on the right side of the law. And that means jade. The piece he picked up last week has been carved by the jade carvers of Suzhou in China, and Conor is pleased with the result. &quot;Oh wow,&quot; he says, knowledgably. But what is it worth? &quot;Like all art, its value is what a collector is prepared to pay,&quot; he says.  Which turns out to be precisely nothing. Someone in Taiwan makes him a sort of offer, but then retracts it because he thought he was only doing it for the cameras. No one in Hong Kong wants to know. To be honest, I&apos;m not surprised - Conor&apos;s piece of carved jade is possibly the most hideous thing I&apos;ve ever seen in my life. But the thing about Conor is that you can&apos;t keep him down for long. And he quickly gets into hot beverages, buys a small pot of &quot;vintage tea&quot; for \u00a3750 and takes it to Japan. Weirdly, no one in Japan wants the old tea, so Conor turns to fish, and finally makes a profit - only 75p, but it could be a turning point.  Conor&apos;s a little bit annoying - there&apos;s something of an Apprentice candidate about his eternal optimism. But I do like his approach to travel. In this episode he has hung out with jade carvers, had a stall in a Taiwan market, met the dodgiest tea trader in Hong Kong, caught a few fish in Japan and sold them at market. And I reckon that, in doing so, he&apos;s learned much more about these places than he would have done by visiting the Great Wall, going up Taipei 101 or Victoria Peak in Hong Kong, or seeing the cherry blossom in Osaka. Or by going to watch Grampus 8 play football. I don&apos;t think there are any Augustinian churches in the Far East. I&apos;d still rather go on holiday with either my girlfriend or my mum (maybe not together), but I&apos;m going to start adopting some of Conor&apos;s ideas. In fact, we&apos;re off to Newcastle at the weekend. I thought I&apos;d take something to try to sell. I&apos;m thinking coal could be good. In Kimberley: Young Mum Ten Years On (Channel 4), classy filmmaker Daisy Asquith revisits the subject of a film she made in ... well, it&apos;s obvious when she made it. Not much has changed, except that Kim now looks like Posh Spice. She still lives in south London, she&apos;s still pregnant - or &quot;up the fucking spout&quot; as she charmingly puts it. Well, she&apos;s up the spout again, obviously; her first baby was taken from her, they&apos;re keeping an eye on number two, and this one will be the third. Oh, and she&apos;s still dead entertaining.  It&apos;s bleak but brilliant telly - an honest portrait of being a single young mum on benefits. Incredibly frustrating, too. It must be so for Daisy, who&apos;s become a mate of Kimberly&apos;s, and the godmother of two-year-old Harvey. Most of the time Kim is great, warm and lovely with Harvey, generous. Funny, too (&quot;that&apos;s the postman, must be a cheque for a million pounds&quot;). But then she&apos;ll suddenly lose her rag, and yell, &quot;You little shit, you better come here now,&quot; to Harvey in the playground. I&apos;m pretty sure that&apos;s not in any of the childcare manuals. And you can almost here the alarm bells going off down at Lambeth social services."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/apr/24/tefl", "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["Tefl"], "sentences": ["Now people in Taiwan consider me a qualified ELT teacher and I&apos;m working as a lecturer at my university in Taipei,&quot; he said."], "title": "Tesol qualifications: mastering the 'long conversation'", "article": "Most teachers of English who undertake a master&apos;s in ELT or applied linguistics are seeking to engage more deeply with their chosen profession. What might come as a surprise to some is the kind of engagement they are likely to have with other students on their course and what this can bring to their studies. Sarah Mattin, currently teaching at Salford University, England, completed an MEd in ELT at Manchester University. Like many ELT master&apos;s programmes, her group was made up of teachers from a diverse range of countries. As well as native English speakers, the group included a significant number of English teachers from European and east Asian countries.&quot;There were a lot of Chinese teachers on my course,&quot; said Mattin. &quot;This was useful for me, as although I had experience of teaching in Europe and Australia, I had no real idea what English teaching in Asia was like. Now I feel I have a much better insight into the previous language learning experience of Asian students, which is helpful in my current job.&quot; Bringing together a wide variety of English teachers, each with their own context-specific professional experience, adds to the value of master&apos;s programmes. Academic discussions during course time about language learning, teaching and linguistics are enriched through having a multicultural group willing to share their teaching experience and often culturally bound attitudes and opinions. This is a point that American Angie Brice, an English teacher for the UN in Geneva, highlighted: &quot;I completed an MA in ELT and applied linguistics at King&apos;s College London last summer. Being at university full-time gave me the opportunity to surround myself with students and professors whose ideas and interactions become part of my learning experience.&quot; Dr Richard Keily is the co-ordinator of master&apos;s and doctoral programmes in Tesol and applied linguistics at the University of Bristol. He describes the interactive element of university-based MA programmes as &quot;extremely valuable&quot;, which he says gives students a significant advantage over those completing a potentially &quot;isolating&quot; distance-taught equivalent. &quot;Postgraduate courses are essentially a series of long conversations, not merely an isolated process of reading and reproducing their understanding in writing. Face-to-face interaction helps students to make sense of what they are reading. It enables them to develop arguments and check understanding in an engaging way.&quot; Keily also stresses the benefits of face-to-face study to grasp &quot;the unwritten culture of learning&quot;. &quot;This aspect of learning is particularly important for those teachers who would like to progress to doctoral study after the master&apos;s,&quot; he said. Two other former King&apos;s College students, Pawe\u0142 Mayevsky, now working to establish his own private language school in Wroc\u0142aw, Poland, and Chieh-Wei Shiue, lecturing at Shih-Chen University in Taipei, highlight more pragmatic benefits underlying their decision to study in England for a year. Pawe\u0142 says that he chose to complete his MA in London for two main reasons: &quot;First of all, as an English teacher in Poland, an MA from a British university is very highly regarded. Secondly, although my English is good, I knew I would find writing assignments in English challenging. Coming to the UK gave me the opportunity to use and improve my English every day. It helped me to be able to go to lectures in English, and have the opportunity to discuss my assignments with professors and the other students.&quot; Chieh-Wei acknowledges that the primary motivation behind his decision to complete an MA in the UK lay in enhancing his professional status back home. &quot;Although I had four years of ELT material editing experience, I still needed to obtain a master&apos;s degree in ELT in order to become an ELT teacher. Now people in Taiwan consider me a qualified ELT teacher and I&apos;m working as a lecturer at my university in Taipei,&quot; he said. Distance learning master&apos;s programmes have the advantage of flexibility, allowing teachers to fit their learning around work commitments. However, if you have the time, and money, studying for a master&apos;s at university alongside fellow teachers from around the world offers a richer interactive, shared learning experience. As Chieh-Wei noted: &quot;Attending the programme enabled me to know the faculty in person and encounter interesting classmates. I learned a lot from them. Discussion and networking are also crucial. You won&apos;t get those so easily through a distance programme.&quot; \u2022 Colm Downes is an English language teacher and recent MA Tesol graduate."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/apr/25/internet-picks", "publicationDate": "2009-04-24T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Internet", "Technology"], "sentences": ["On X Factor in Taiwan they do folk New Order covers Film-maker Michel Gondry sells his own toilet paper It&apos;s not OK to Twitter through a movie."], "title": "What we learned on the web this week", "article": "The exciting new way to carry a baby What would Andy Warhol do on the internet?

With its four soaring buttresses topped by statues, the Palais forms the centrepiece of the Parc des Expositions in Brussels - a trade-fair complex built in the 1930s to commemorate a century of independence from the Netherlands. This is the temporary home of thousands of fish products from around the world as 23,000 delegates descend from 80 countries for the annual European Seafood Exposition - the world&apos;s largest seafood trade show and a grim reminder of man&apos;s dominion over the oceans. &quot;If I wanted people to understand the global fishing crisis, I would bring them here,&quot; says Sally Bailey, a marine programme officer with the World Wide Fund for Nature, one of the more moderate NGOs combating the exploitation of the seas. Last year, one of the more militant groups - Greenpeace - managed to &quot;close down&quot; five exhibitors trading in critically endangered bluefin tuna, by deploying 80 activists to drape their stands in fishing nets, chain themselves to fixtures and put up banners that read: &quot;Time and tuna are running out&quot;.  Their main target was the Mitsubishi Corporation, the Japanese car manufacturer that is also the world&apos;s largest tuna trader, controlling 60% of the market and accounting for 40% of all bluefin tuna imported into Japan from the Mediterranean. The other companies were Dongwon Industries (Korea), Moon Marine (Taiwan/ Singapore), Azzopardi Fisheries (Malta) and Ricardo Fuentes &amp; Sons (Spain). The day I am there, Greenpeace activists are stalking EU fisheries ministers and waiting for a chance to unfurl their banners - but the security guards thwart them. However, the gargantuan catch on display speaks for itself. At the stand run by the Sea Wealth Frozen Food Company of Thailand, the shelves are groaning with jauntily designed packets of frozen squid, surimi (minced fish) dumplings, spring rolls, samosas and deep-fried cones with shrimp tails poking out of them. In the next aisle, a frenetic chef is wok-frying prawns from Madagascar, dipping them in little square dishes of cumin, coriander, chilli powder, salt, cinnamon and garlic. At the Taiwan Pavilion, the cabinets are full of chilled and frozen tilapia, barramundi, sushi, eel and vacuum packs of tobiko - orange flying-fish roe, salty, crunchy as granola and served by a young woman in national dress who literally has not heard of sustainability. &quot;All the boats are out there catching fish with roe,&quot; she tells me. &quot;With so many after the same species, this is a very difficult business for us.&quot;  These halls take several hours to negotiate, and the stands seemingly go on forever - 1,650 businesses in all, together peddling most of the 147m tonnes of seafood produced globally every year. Of this, 100m tonnes is caught in the wild while the rest is farmed to satisfy an insatiable demand. Already, 1.2bn people depend on fish in their diet - and in Europe we each consume 20kg per year on average, compared to 5kg per person in India. However, as the emergent middle classes in Asia develop a taste, and a budget, for seafood - considered a luxury item until now - demand will rocket further. What the organisers must know, but are keeping mum about, is that the oceans are in a parlous state. The UN&apos;s Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that 70% of the world&apos;s fisheries are now fully exploited (ie, fished to the point where they can only just replenish themselves), overexploited or depleted. The majority of fish populations have been reduced by 70-95%, depending on the species, compared to the level they would be at if there were no fishing at all. In other words, only five per cent of fish are left in some cases. In more practical terms, fishermen are catching one or two fish per 100 hooks, compared to 10 fish per 100 hooks where a stock is healthy and unexploited - a measure of sustainability once used by the Japanese fleet. In England and Wales, we are landing one fish for every 20 that we landed in 1889, when government records began, despite having larger vessels, more sophisticated technology and trawl nets so vast and all-consuming that they are capable of containing 12 Boeing 747 aircraft.  Where have all those other fish gone? In short, we have eaten them. &quot;Tens of thousands of bluefin tuna used to be caught in the North Sea every year,&quot; says Callum Roberts, professor of marine conservation at the University of York. &quot;Now, there are none. Once, there were millions of skate - huge common skate, white skate, long-nosed skate - being landed from seas around the UK. The common skate is virtually extinct, the angel shark has gone. We have lost our marine megafauna as a consequence of exploitation.&quot; Then there are the devastating effects of bottom trawling around our coasts, which began with the advent of the steam trawler 130 years ago. &quot;Sweeping backwards and forwards across the seabed, they removed a whole carpet of invertebrates,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;such as corals, sponges, sea fans and seaweeds. On one map, dating from 1883, there is a huge area of the North Sea roughly the size of Wales, marked &apos;Oyster beds&apos;. The last oysters were fished there commercially in the 1930s; the last live oyster was taken in the 1970s. We have altered the marine environment in a spectacular way.&quot;  Worse still, after stripping our own seas bare, we have &quot;exported fishing capacity to the waters of developing countries&quot;, Professor Roberts warns. Off Mauritania, Senegal and other West African countries, fleets from the rich industrial north are &quot;fishing in a totally unsustainable way with minimal oversight by European countries&quot;. In return for plundering the oceans, which deprives local people of food, and artisanal fishermen of their livelihood, these vessels pay minimal fees that impoverished countries are happy to accept. &quot;It is a mining operation,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;a rerun of the exploitation of terrestrial wealth that happened in colonial days. This is colonialism in a new guise, albeit with a respectable cloak in the form of access agreements.&quot;  Such is the human feeding frenzy, there may come a time when there are no fish left to catch. In 2006, a study in the US journal Science warned that every single species we exploit would have collapsed by 2048 if populations continued to decline as they had since the 1950s. By 2003, nearly a third of all species had collapsed, the study found - meaning their numbers were down 90% or more on historic maximum catch levels. Extrapolate that on a graph, and the downward curve reaches 100% just before 2050.  That prognosis - now disputed - was based on a four-year study of fish populations, catch records and ocean ecosystems. &quot;We really see the end of the line now,&quot; said the author Boris Worm of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, at the time. &quot;It will be in our lifetime. Our children will see a world without seafood, if we do not change things.&quot; Many imagined a world where there would be no fish protein left to eat apart from jellyfish and marine algae. What the study did not make sufficiently clear was that some fish populations had bounced back as a result of drastic measures by the authorities. In countries such as Iceland, Norway, the United States, New Zealand and Australia, fisheries management has been strengthened by controls that limit fishing effort (the number of boats out there, the time they spend at sea and the areas where they are allowed to fish). Another management approach, especially in Europe, is to control output (the amount of fish landed) using Total Allowable Catch quotas, or TACs. These are designed to maintain a stock&apos;s biomass - the estimated weight of fish left in the sea after fishing and natural deaths are taken into account. It should never be allowed to fall so low that a species is unable to spawn a healthy generation the following year. Drawn up by scientists and organisations such as Ices (the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), these quotas are discussed by fisheries ministers and fishermen at forums such as the EU. Both have vested interests, whether political or commercial. &quot;If you put the fox in charge of the henhouse,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;decisions will be based on short-term constraints, such as paying the mortgage on the boat. Politicians, too, make choices that are beneficial to them or their constituents in the short term.&quot;  In other words, such gatherings often ride roughshod over the scientists&apos; recommendations - as happened at a meeting of ICCAT (the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas) in Luxembourg in 2007, where quotas were being thrashed out for bluefin tuna from the Mediterranean. Scientists recommended an annual catch of 15,000 tonnes a year, with a preference for 10,000 tonnes - but EU ministers agreed a quota of 29,000 tonnes, enough to guarantee the collapse of the species. (Last year, quotas for 2009 were again set far higher than scientists were advising.) In fact, the real amount of bluefin landed was 61,000 tonnes - four times what scientists had recommended - due to illegal and unreported fishing. Last month, the European Commission implemented a two-year control and inspection programme for bluefin tuna fisheries in seven Mediterranean countries, to clamp down on things such as illegal spotter planes used to track down tuna schools. Globally, black-market fishing is worth US$25bn (\u00a317bn) a year. In Europe, 50% of the cod we eat has been caught illegally. Those figures, and the Luxembourg debacle, are recorded in The End of the Line - the documentary, based on Charles Clover&apos;s book of that name, to be screened in UK cinemas from 8 June. However, the blatant disregard for science it portrays is not an isolated case. &quot;We have analysed the decision-making of European fisheries ministers over the past 20 years,&quot; says Professor Roberts, &quot;and systematically, year on year, they have set quotas that are 25 to 35% higher than the levels recommended by scientists.&quot;  How can our politicians get away with it? &quot;There is no obligation upon them to take scientific advice,&quot; Professor Roberts explains. &quot;What they will tell you is that it is only one of the things they have to consider. While they might be protecting a fisherman&apos;s livelihood in the term of one or two years, short-term decision-making like that guarantees stock collapse. It is not just a possibility, it is a certainty. The only uncertainty is how long it will take.&quot;  According to Professor Roberts: &quot;What politicians should be deciding is how the catch is allocated within different nations. That is politics. What they shouldn&apos;t be deciding is how big the catch should be in the first place. That is science.&quot;  In Norway and the US, &quot;they respect the advice of scientists&quot;, he adds - the best example being New England, where stocks of ground fish were in serious decline in the mid-1990s, but enlightened management brought them back. &quot;At Georges Bank, they created a closed area of 20,000 square kilometres that was off-limits to mobile fishing gear [such as trawl nets],&quot; Professor Roberts explains. They also cut fishing effort by a draconian 50% - putting many fishermen out of business. In the past 10 years, however, there has been &quot;a spectacular recovery&quot; of key economic species, Roberts says. &quot;The haddock has bounced back, the flounder has bounced back, the scallops have bounced back, so it has been a great success story.&quot;  What this demonstrates is that, where there is political will, the tide can be turned on overfishing. In the US, a piece of 1976 legislation called the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act has recently been reauthorised, requiring the industry to end overfishing in all federal waters by 2011. There is no such legislation in Europe. Under the existing Act, fisheries in Alaska and the North Pacific are already well managed - which is why wild Pacific salmon, Pacific cod and pollock from Alaska were prime candidates for certification by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), the international NGO that created a standard for sustainable fisheries in the late 1990s and upholds it. Why do these US fisheries tick all the boxes?  &quot;They have very progressive management under the North Pacific Fishery Management Council,&quot; Professor Roberts says, &quot;with precautionary targets - so they go for a relatively low fraction of the fish population each year. They have closures to protect habitats and valued species such as Steller sea lions and sea otters [which can get caught in fishing gear] plus extensive areas that are closed to protect deep-water corals from destruction by bottom trawling.&quot;The authorities also impose quotas for bycatch - other species caught by mistake - to protect them from exploitation.  These are the kinds of issues the MSC is looking at when certifying fisheries. So far, 43 have been certified, including 10 in Britain, while more than 100 are under assessment - but what exactly does that mean? &quot;Right from the start, the idea was that fisheries would be independently assessed by a third party,&quot; says James Simpson, communications officer at the MSC, &quot;so although we set the standard, we don&apos;t carry out the assessments. That is important, because it means we don&apos;t have any influence over the results.&quot; Instead, marine scientists from certifying bodies such as Food Certification International and Moody Marine do the work, delving into every aspect of sustainability and producing a report up to 900 pages long. &quot;They look at stock levels, based on historical records,&quot; says Simpson, &quot;at the impact fishing is having on the environment and at the management plan for the fishery.&quot;  A score of 80 or more must be achieved against each of these three criteria for a fishery to be certified.  The initial assessment is peer-reviewed by fellow scientists, stakeholders such as environmental groups have their say - and the fishery gets to carry the eco-label on its products. &quot;To do that, you have to be able to trace the fish all the way through the supply chain,&quot; says Simpson, &quot;because you don&apos;t want any non-certified species or illegally caught fish slipping into an MSC batch.&quot;  The science may be rigorous, but will the MSC label change the world?  With some species, the label is making a big difference: 42% of the world&apos;s wild salmon catch is MSC-certified, and 40% of its prime white fish catch. Altogether, five million tonnes of seafood are certified by the MSC every year.  However, that is just five per cent of the wild-caught seafood market, which is why Professor Roberts believes the label itself &quot;can only change a small number of well-informed people who actually care&quot;. The big effect, he says, is that supermarkets &quot;have taken on board what the MSC is saying and have developed better fish sourcing policies of their own. They are the ones who can buy or not buy from a particular supplier, so they have a lot of power.&quot;  Sainsbury&apos;s - the largest retailer of MSC-certified seafood in the UK - has pledged that, by the end of 2010, it will source 80% of its seafood from MSC-certified fisheries or from the &quot;green list&quot; of species approved by the Marine Conservation Society. Marks &amp; Spencer has promised that, by 2012, all its seafood will be either MSC-certified or from other independently certified fisheries. In May, it will launch a new range of prepared meals for outdoor eating and barbecues, based around gurnard, John Dory and black bream. Caught in season in British waters, these are a more sustainable choice than the &quot;Big Five&quot; overfished species - the cod, haddock, prawns, tuna and plaice that account for 80% of all seafood sold in Britain. If we take the pressure off these overexploited stocks, they will hopefully recover. However, the MSC programme is about far more than shopping. In Europe, the growing number of certified fisheries has transformed the mood of EU fishing negotiations. The Dutch based Pelagic Freezer-Trawler Association (PFA) was the first North Sea herring fishery to be MSC-certified in May 2006, and the Swedish, Danish and Scottish herring fleets followed. Their representatives meet regularly in Brussels to talk about fisheries management. &quot;All the major herring players in Europe are MSC-certified or under assessment,&quot; says Gerard van Balsfoort, president of the PFA, &quot;and this has led to a certain kind of behaviour in the advisory process. From the point of view of stocks, you can&apos;t just ask for a higher quota if it isn&apos;t scientifically based. You can&apos;t just shout for what you want. &quot; In the seas around South Georgia - a remote Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom 1,300km from the Falkland Islands - the Patagonian toothfish fishery was required by MSC certifiers to initiate research that would locate deep-coral areas vulnerable to damage by trawl gear. If such areas were found, efforts to protect them &quot;should be considered&quot;, the certifiers said. In fact, the fishery went further. It identified three deep-coral areas that needed protecting and closed them to fishing vessels entirely. That way, fish and fragile habitats would have a chance to recover.  In South Africa and New Zealand, too, MSC-certified fisheries (for hake and hoki respectively) have helped create Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) where trawling is banned, either by funding research or by lobbying the government. In New Zealand, 30% of the Exclusive Economic Zone - an area extending 220 miles out to sea over which it has rights - has been closed with fishing industry approval. Such closures could provide the answer to the fishing crisis, allowing our children and our grandchildren to eat fish with a clear conscience. In Iceland, Canada and the US, the creation of MPAs &quot;has brought real increases in fish populations and real recovery of seabed habitats&quot;, Professor Roberts reports. &quot;Populations of exploited species have increased five-, 10- or even 20-fold within five, 10 or 20 years,&quot; he says. &quot;What you see is the flourishing of life.&quot; Over time, this explosion of fecundity spreads to other parts of the ocean. &quot;The benefits of protection flow to the surrounding fishing grounds through the emigration of animals from protected areas, and the export of their offspring on ocean currents,&quot; Professor Roberts says. &quot;The eggs and larvae of these protected animals are transported to fishing grounds and can replenish them.&quot; In his view, 30% of the world&apos;s oceans should be protected &quot;to set the clock back 200 years&quot; and reverse the fishing crisis. After that, responsible fisheries management &quot;in the North Pacific mould&quot; could avert the 2048 scenario. The trouble is, only 0.8% of the oceans are currently closed to fishing - despite the efforts of former President George W Bush, who &quot;single-handedly created MPAs, dotted throughout the Pacific Ocean, which now constitute 31% of all MPAs worldwide&quot;, Professor Roberts says.  In Britain, too, MPAs are seen as part of the solution. The Marine Bill is grinding its way through Parliament, with a provision to create MPAs in territorial waters up to 12 nautical miles from our coast. Britain and Europe have pledged to create networks of MPAs by 2012. Far from campaigning for a total ban on fishing, Professor Roberts believes it should be allowed. If properly regulated, it will increase global fish production rather than decimate it. &quot;Fisheries science suggests that a species is healthiest when you reduce its population size by 50%,&quot; he says. &quot;That way, you remove the larger, older, slower-growing animals and the population becomes dominated by smaller, faster-growing fish. For them, the availability of food increases and they thrive. That gives you a boost in population growth rate, which gives you a higher rate of production to exploit.&quot; Perversely, fishing could swamp the world with fish protein rather than starve it - but it has to be done differently. &quot;We should abandon quotas,&quot; Professor Roberts believes, limiting fishing effort rather than output. &quot;If you&apos;re not out there catching fish, they&apos;re not going to die.&quot; At present, EU vessels that exceed their quota have to dump fish overboard dead, rather than land it illegally. &quot;You&apos;ve got one or two times as many fish being killed and discarded, sometimes, as are being landed,&quot; Professor Roberts says. &quot;That is no way to manage a fishery; that is not sensible at all. You have to land all your catch.&quot; Reforms such as this will require &quot;a major change of political direction on this side of the Atlantic&quot;, Professor Roberts warns - &quot;but if we have that, we can turn back the clock within 20 years, to the point where a lot of species are in a far more productive state. None of this is rocket science. Perhaps we need good old George W Bush back... the world&apos;s greatest marine conservationist!&quot;  \u2022 Read more from Andrew Purvis about fish on OFM&apos;s food blog, Word of Mouth.

The outbreak of swine flu in Mexico has rapidly claimed more than 100 lives, with another 400 people in hospitals around the country. The news sent airline and tourism stocks plunging today while shares in drug companies and medical glovemakers soared. The dollar dropped to its lowest level against the yen in a month and the Mexican peso lost about 3% in electronic trading last night. Oil prices also fell on concerns that swine flu could deal a fresh blow to the beleaguered world economy and commodities such as copper were also lower. Though the deaths have been limited to Mexico, swine flu is spreading with 20 cases in the United States and six in Canada, and possible cases reported as far afield as Israel, New Zealand and Scotland. Spain today became the first European country to confirm a case of swine flu when a man who returned from a trip to Mexico last week was found to have the virus. Following Asian and European markets lower, Wall Street fell more than 60 points after the open. The Dow Jones was down 0.75% at 8016 points. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost more than 60 points this morning, falling to 4095.06, a decline of about 1.5%. By early afternoon, it was down 28 points at 4128.02. British Airways plunged nearly 17% to 139.7p in early trading and later traded more than 8% lower. Travel stocks including the cruise company Carnival, InterContinental Hotels, TUI and Thomas Cook were also among the biggest losers on the FTSE. However, the pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Shire and Smith and Nephew rallied. GSK gained nearly 5% to \u00a310.55, while Switzerland&apos;s Roche rose more than 4% to Sfr145.20. Drugmakers said yesterday they could supply millions of doses of medicine and were ready to work on a vaccine against swine flu. Roche&apos;s Tamiflu and GlaxoSmithKline&apos;s Relenza anti-viral treatments have been shown to work against samples of the new disease. Roche said it was trying to boost production of Tamiflu but cautioned that this would take time. Medical glovemakers also benefited from the flu scare. Shares of Top Glove, the world&apos;s largest listed rubber latex glovemaker, jumped more than 8% on the Malaysian stock exchange. Kossan and Supermax, both rubber glovemakers, also rallied. In Asia, most stockmarkets ended in the red, with Hong Kong and Taiwan losing nearly 3%. Investors in Asia are particularly nervous after a panic about bird flu in 2005 and 2006 hit tourism in the region, following an outbreak of Sars in 2003. Sars lasted six months and killed 775 of 8,000 infected people in 25 countries. &quot;A nasty chill will run through the market with swine flu as people think back to the Sars virus,&quot; said Justin Urquhart Stewart, of Seven Investment Management. &quot;The threat of the pandemic will add further weakness to global trade \u2013 we saw with Sars tangible percentage points knocked off the index and that was in a buoyant time. Put that in a weaker time and it is likely to be more unpleasant.&quot; The swine flu scare comes just as policymakers have spotted signs of stabilisation \u2013 the famous green shoots \u2013 in the global economy. Lawrence Summers, economic adviser to Barack Obama, said yesterday: &quot;Six or eight weeks ago, there were no positive statistics to be found anywhere. The economy felt like it was falling vertically. Today, the picture is much more mixed. I think that sense of unremitting freefall that we had a month or two ago is not present today.&quot; The World Health Organisation declared the flu a &quot;public health emergency of international concern&quot; that could become a pandemic, and the United States declared its own public health emergency. US officials ordered the immediate release of 12m doses of the anti-viral treatments Tamiflu and Relenza \u2013 a quarter of the US stockpile collected over the last few years after the outbreak of avian flu. Governments around the world ordered \u00a3220m worth of Relenza and Sfr304m (\u00a3203m) of Tamiflu between January and March. There was some hope, however, as the majority of infected patients in Mexico have recovered from the illness, according to the government. The World Bank estimated last year that a flu pandemic could cost $3tn (\u00a32tn) and trigger a near-5% slide in global gross domestic product. The fragile state of the world economy was underlined by Japan slashing its growth forecast today to a decline of 3.3% in the year to next March, from an estimate of zero growth."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/may/02/ed-pien-exhibition-manchester-chinese-arts-centre", "publicationDate": "2009-05-01T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Exhibitions", "Art and design", "Culture", "North listings"], "sentences": ["Apparently, illegal immigrants from China are informally known as &quot;ghosts&quot;, a fact that Taiwan-born artist Ed Pien plays on here in Memento, an installation about displacement and disorientation that is as eerie as it is dreamy."], "title": "Exhibition preview: Ed Pien, Manchester", "article": "Apparently, illegal immigrants from China are informally known as &quot;ghosts&quot;, a fact that Taiwan-born artist Ed Pien plays on here in Memento, an installation about displacement and disorientation that is as eerie as it is dreamy.

The movement was inchoate, contradictory and politically confused but it remains the biggest peaceful pro-democracy movement in human history. For the millions who took part, life would never be the same again. Last week I listened to a man in his 40s unburden himself of a secret he had carried for two decades. He was a student leader in a major provincial city, and although he was arrested in mid-June 1989, he was released after a month of enforced confessions. He moved to another city and eventually made a successful career. But for 20 years the burden of the hopes that were shattered on 4 June, and the apprehension that he could be targeted at any time by a regime that never forgets and rarely forgives, has weighed on his spirit. It is part fear, part depression, part rage.  Some are still in prison. Others, in mourning, are still harassed. A few campaign openly for a reversal of the Communist Party&apos;s verdict that the movement was the work of &quot;a small clique of counter-revolutionaries&quot; who wanted to overthrow the party and the socialist system. Behind the few high-profile campaigners and dissidents is the much larger throng of those who still nurse memories too painful to discuss.  It&apos;s been two decades since that lone protester defied a column of tanks on Beijing&apos;s Avenue of Eternal Peace, before vanishing, never to be identified. Since that time, China has prospered economically. The party has embraced the market and traded the socialist system it claimed to defend for the pleasures of getting rich. Younger generations are vague about a movement that still cannot be publicly discussed or documented. But the suppression at Tiananmen continues to exact a high price: the constant falsification of history, a political system frozen by the fear of the people&apos;s judgment, and a leadership that sees the ghosts of Tiananmen wherever voices call for political reform.  Four years ago a cautious official commemoration of Hu Yaobang raised hopes that Tiananmen might finally be reassessed. Since then the party has stalled, perhaps waiting for the deaths of the chief perpetrators and beneficiaries, Li Peng and Jiang Zemin, before it begins to re-examine the single most traumatic episode of recent times.  Tiananmen marked the moment when the Chinese Communist Party relinquished its ideological claim on the loyalty of the people. After that, its message was material: as long as its citizens were content to leave politics to the party, the party would deliver prosperity. Superficially, it has worked - and the ideas so vigorously discussed in 1989 have given way to the truculent nationalism of new generations.  But China has a culture that honours its dead, and Tiananmen&apos;s dead are privately remembered by millions. Until the democracy movement of 1989 is acknowledged for what it was, a massive expression of popular demand for a government accountable to its people, the ghosts of the dead and nightmares of the living will not be laid to rest. \u2022 Isabel Hilton is the editor of online magazine Chinadialogue &apos;What happened that night reshaped my life completely&apos;     Wuer Kaixi: &#8216;I feel sorry for the victims. We were the leaders &#8211; we survived.&#8217; Photograph: Dan Chung    Wuer Kaixi, 41, was a leader of the student protests and number two on the Most Wanted list. After the crackdown he fled first to France, where he was a founder of the Federation for a Democratic China, and then to the US. He now lives in Taiwan.  Two decades on, Wuerkaixi still slips between past and present tense as he talks about that night in June; still gulps and falters. &quot;The tanks sounded enormous ... Bullets were in the air... The blood was very real. You can smell it. People&apos;s panic and anger... In the hospital the doctors&apos; gowns were no longer white. And you knew it wasn&apos;t from just one person ... it was overwhelming.&quot; What happened that night &quot;has reshaped my life completely&quot;, he says. Outwardly, there is little now to connect him to the angry young man who became world-famous for rebuking hardline premier Li Peng and subsequently held second place on Beijing&apos;s Most Wanted list. Aged just 21, he was smuggled out of the country and fled to France via Hong Kong. Since the mid-90s he has lived in Taiwan, where he works for an investment fund, writing political commentaries in his spare time. He has not seen his parents for 20 years - they are not allowed to leave China - but he is married to a Taiwanese woman and they have two sons. &quot;I&apos;m more fortunate than other exiles. I have a home,&quot; he says. Like many protesters, he had no history of political involvement. As a freshman at Beijing Normal University he shared the gloom that was spreading through China: the initial enthusiasm for economic reforms was waning as inequality crept in and political reform stalled. A failed student movement in 1986 had merely spurred the downfall of Hu Yaobang, the popular, reformist general secretary of the Communist party. News of his death three years later was &quot;a spark thrown into a gunpowder keg&quot;. One thousand students rallied on campus. Drawn deeper into activism, Wuer Kaixi became one of the founders of the hunger strike as the student movement swelled. He was hospitalised but rushed back to the square when told that a government leader would come to speak to the students. He was still in his hospital gown when he confronted Li Peng: the images of him rebuking the premier were beamed around the world.  Wuer Kaixi insists it was not a stunt. They had hoped for real dialogue, he says, but arrived to find a government showcase, with TV cameras and Li&apos;s &quot;never-ending monologue. It was the mentality of the government - an old man lecturing troubling youngsters. I said, &apos;This may be a little impolite, but we do not have time to go on like this.&apos; Li Peng said he was sorry he arrived late and blamed the students for blocking traffic. I said, &apos;You were late not by 10 minutes but by one month.&apos;&quot; It is to the credit of journalists, he says, that the footage was broadcast to the nation. Like the fan mail that filled a truck in the following days, it reflected widespread support for the students. But, like many of the original activists, Wuer Kaixi was already dismayed by the development of the protests as more radical voices gained increasing sway among the crowd. &quot;We were no longer in control of the masses in the square. I felt it was the beginning of the failure,&quot; he says.  But Wuer Kaixi is still proud of &quot;one of the most rational and well-organised and remarkable movements of all time in human history&quot;, and has little patience for critics. &quot;I will always feel sorry for the victims. We were the student leaders and we survived - they didn&apos;t. But we have done our reflection. If anyone needs to be blamed, it is the Chinese government.&quot; Tania Branigan &apos;I feel I have to be doing something political&apos;     Chaohua Wang who was involved in the 1989 Beijing Tiananmen Square protests photographed near her home in North London. Photograph: Richard Saker    Chaohua Wang, 56, was a student leader in the spring of 1989, and after 4 June was on the Chinese government&apos;s Most Wanted list. She is now a writer and editor living in Los Angeles. Chaohua Wang was a key organiser of the protests but escaped with her life while many of her friends were killed. She still agonises over what went wrong. &quot;Ultimately it comes down to the fact that we didn&apos;t have enough intellectual preparation to make meaningful demands,&quot; she says. Wang may have survived but she made other sacrifices - a six year-old son she was forced to leave when she went into hiding before escaping to Los Angeles. She did not see him again for 15 years. Her father died, too, while she was in hiding. &quot;He thought I would be imprisoned - he lost all hope.&quot;  In LA Wang worked as a cleaner until she had learned enough English to enrol as a an MA student at UCLA, from where she later earned her MA and PHD degrees. She set up a website and began writing political essays. &quot;I feel I have to be doing something political, even if it&apos;s just self-comforting.&quot; In 1989 she was two years into an MA in modern Chinese literature when she heard a man with a megaphone in Tiananmen Square asking for representatives from Beijing&apos;s 47 universities. Wang found she had one of the strongest voices. &quot;During the cultural revolution we had been encouraged to be argumentative, to stand up and speak.&quot; She became part of the students&apos; organising committee and oversaw the protests from beginning to end. The 27 April march where students and workers came together was the high point for Wang. &quot;It was a huge demonstration of public will. But we had no plan - we stopped running events and events started running us.&quot;  The student leaders weren&apos;t eating or sleeping properly. Wang lost her voice. Her hair got so dirty she cut it off. When the military entered central Beijing, she was in hospital with exhaustion. She dreamed of New Year firecrackers. When she awoke, the ward was deserted. &quot;People were sitting crying on the kerbs. The atmosphere in the city was more anger than fear.&quot;  In hiding, she saw her name on the government&apos;s &quot;21 Most Wanted&quot; list. If caught, she faced imprisonment or execution. She had no choice but to leave. The closest she has since been to China was in 2004 at Hong Kong airport, where she met her son, by then aged 21. Tom Templeton &apos;Did we make any difference? I&apos;m not sure that we did&apos;     Shen Tong at the offices of his software company VFinity, New York City. Photograph: Anna Schori    Shen Tong, now 40, was a leading organiser of the protests. He was on Changan Avenue when troops opened fire on the students. Days later, he fled to the US. Twenty years ago, Shen Tong was 20. He was a thoughtful student at Beida University who became one of the main negotiators of the Tiananmen Square demonstration, co-chairing the committee on dialogue with the Chinese government. &quot;I always expected things to be harsh,&quot; he recalls when I meet him in the New York office of his software company, VFinity. But when the harshness came, even he didn&apos;t believe it. The person standing next to him on Changan Avenue collapsed and died and still he thought: &quot;Oh, it&apos;s a rubber bullet.&quot;  People were bleeding in the courtyard of his home, being dragged on to roofs for safety, and yet, he says: &quot;You somehow felt you were invincible. It took so long for reality to sink in.&quot; Shen had been accepted to do a masters in biology at Brandeis University in Massachusetts; by means he still cannot reveal, he managed to collect his new passport, remain in hiding for six days and fly to the US, where he gave a press conference supplying the first eyewitness account by a student leader of the massacre. Months later, he was named one of its people of the year by Newsweek. For the next 10 years, he worked tirelessly to raise awareness of human rights in China. Under the umbrella of his non-profit organisation, the Democracy in China Fund, he returned to China in 1992, testing Deng Xiaoping&apos;s assertion that students who had left would be welcomed. &quot;Sure enough,&quot; he says with an ironic smile, &quot;they put me away.&quot;  He was imprisoned for 54 days and released only after he became a figurehead for human rights as part of Bill Clinton&apos;s presidential campaign. &quot;We&apos;re still too close to it to understand what happened,&quot; he says when I ask what 1989 achieved. &quot;We&apos;re too close to the French Revolution, let alone to Tiananmen.&quot; Broadly, intellectually, he can say this: &quot;If there is a simple answer, it highlighted the key question of how to keep in step with the rest of the world. Right after 89, the government said: we really need to justify the regime. A completely self-righteous totalitarian regime is much worse than a technocrat-run authoritarian regime justifying its legitimacy by some means that&apos;s close to human life, such as economic development.&quot; Personally, though, his feelings are far more ambivalent. &quot;Did we make any difference? I&apos;m not sure we did,&quot; he reflects. &quot;It&apos;s a huge price to pay: my youthful years, all of them. Second only to my own family, my beliefs remain probably the most important thing to me. But I don&apos;t know what to do with them.&quot; He has done many things: he has written a memoir, Almost a Revolution; scholarly essays; film criticism; novels. He set up a TV production company and opened a bookshop. Then he hit upon the idea of using technology to empower people. Since the early 90s he had been involved in smuggling modems into China. Now he does business there officially.  In general, the people Shen knew in exile became very hard. He sought a different way of being: he has married and has two young children. They live in SoHo and collect art. Emphatically, he says: &quot;I have a normal life. It sounds so basic, but among the exiles, that hasn&apos;t been basic at all.&quot; Gaby Wood &apos;In some ways no ideal is worth those human lives&apos;     Diane Wei Liang at home in London. Photograph: Katherine Rose    Diane Wei Liang, 42, is a detective novelist living in London with her husband and two children. Her books include The Eye of Jade and Paper Butterfly. She took part in the 1989 protests while a student in Beijing and fled to the US soon afterwards.  In Diane Wei Liang&apos;s smart Holland Park town house, a street away from the school where her children play with George Osborne&apos;s, the revolutionary spirit of mid-1980s Beijing seems impossibly distant. Impeccably groomed in skinny jeans with a shiny curtain of hair, Wei Lang has removed herself from her past in every possible way, changing not just her country of residence but her name, her nationality and the language she speaks. She renamed herself Diane as soon as she reached the west. Since then, she has renounced her Chinese citizenship and speaks only English to her children. She says her husband, a management consultant born in Germany, is upset they will not learn Mandarin but you get the sense that Liang is happy to put as much distance as she can between her new life and the one she led before the Tiananmen crackdown.  In 1989 she was 22, an academic high-flier, keen to escape her background and study in America. The daughter of two college-educated professionals, she had grown up in a labour camp where her parents had been sent with other &quot;intellectuals&quot;. However, as some of her friends were politically engaged, Liang was drawn almost by osmosis into the pro-democracy movement which culminated in the massacre on 4 June. She marched, took water to the hunger-strikers and climbed up on top of a tank, pushing leaflets on its occupants. She is not sure she would be as brave today. &quot;It&apos;s in the Chinese culture to exchange blood for freedom, but I&apos;ve seen the bodies and I&apos;ve seen children being killed by a stray bullet, and in many ways I think that no ideal is worth those human lives.&quot; She recalls the days following the crackdown. &quot;China is a very noisy place but you didn&apos;t even hear children cry. Everyone was shut in. Soldiers&apos; fingers were on the triggers, they shot windows when they heard an insult. Arrests were made. There were telephone hotlines - every day you worried someone would report you.&quot; In those fearful weeks she was amazed to find that a passport application to study abroad which she had entered on the first day of the protests had been approved. Three months later she was in America with $40 and just a few words of English. A month later, in Virginia, she watched the Berlin wall come down.  Liang taught herself English, and took a PhD in business administration at Pittsburgh&apos;s Carnegie Mellon University. She became an economics professor and in the mid-90s was invited to teach on the very first MBA course in China, a measure of the direction the country had taken post-Tiananmen. &quot;When I arrived in Beijing I didn&apos;t know where I was, things had changed so much. I remember talking to my students about Tiananmen. It wasn&apos;t in the text books. Those who had heard of it simply knew the government version, but the rest knew nothing and weren&apos;t interested in it and they were not interested in leaving China either. Everyone just wanted to make money.&quot; Liang married and moved to London where she took a post at Royal Holloway college, part of the University of London. While on maternity leave she wrote a memoir of her childhood in the labour camp and her role in the Tiananmen protests called Lake with No Name. This started her down the road to becoming a full-time novelist, fulfilling a childhood ambition. It has been a long and twisted road.Tom Templeton &apos;When I saw the first dead body I felt cold in my heart&apos;     Wang Juntao in New York. Photograph: Anna Schori    Wang Juntao, 50, ran an independent thinktank and published an underground magazine in China in the 80s. He was an adviser to the student leaders and spent four years in prison following the protests before going into exile in the US. Wang Juntao, one of the most influential thinkers behind the pro-democracy movement in China, was born in 1959, just as construction on Tiananmen Square was nearing completion. His father was a Party general; Wang&apos;s given name, Juntao, means &quot;billowing wave of the army&quot;. After the events of 1989, Wang was arrested, held for 13 months without charge and eventually sentenced to 13 years in prison for his alleged work as a &quot;black hand&quot;, or evil mastermind, of the student demonstration. In prison he contracted hepatitis B and, under pressure from Bill Clinton, the Chinese government offered to send him to the US for a medical exam in 1994. Upon his arrival, he heard himself being called an &quot;exile&quot;; only then did he understand that he could never return. &quot;Although I lost an opportunity to promote democracy in China, I got a chance to find out about other countries,&quot; he tells me when we meet in a Starbucks in New York City, near where he now lives. &quot;And in the future, that will be very helpful to China. When I saw what was happening in Russia and other Soviet countries in the early 1990s, the transition was not too good. Nobody prepared how to deal with the transition - it was just thought, &apos;When the transition happens, everything will be better.&apos; But it&apos;s not true. On the one hand the political system is much better than before, on the other hand the social and economic situations were not good.&quot;  Wang has spent the intervening years studying the matter closely, completing a Masters at Harvard and a PhD at Columbia. Inflation, corruption, military coups, American foreign policy and, above all, the rise of neoconservatism in China since the death of Deng Xiaoping: all of this has come under his intellectual lens. Now he has had offers to teach at many universities, including Oxford. In Beijing Wang was a charismatic figure. He was a poet who co-founded the country&apos;s most professional pro-democracy magazine, Beijing Spring, and throughout the 1980s he campaigned on university campuses, held non-violent demonstrations, established a thinktank. He was methodical and patient, and had Deng Xiaoping&apos;s tacit support. So why was he imprisoned? &quot;They didn&apos;t follow our ideas,&quot; he says now. &quot;I tried to give them some advice, but the students wouldn&apos;t listen to me. I told them very clearly: &apos;You want democracy? We need to very carefully defend what we have built.&apos;&quot;  He wasn&apos;t angry with the students: &quot;I think they did a good job: their demonstration was large-scale and peaceful, their slogans were carefully thought out. But when I saw the first dead body lying in the middle of the road, I felt cold from my heart to my feet. I knew that everything we had worked for was over. The last chance of peaceful transition in China: over. In the west, you think we lost one battle. We lost more than that - not just lives, but opportunity.&quot; Though he cannot go back, he has a vast amount of knowledge, and every other Friday he circulates a &quot;powertalk&quot; - a speaking PowerPoint presentation - in China, continuing to influence the grass roots from abroad. As for the future, he suggests, it is unknown: &quot;The road to democracy is long, and paved with many stones. We don&apos;t know where we are in the road.&quot; As we are leaving, Wang looks around the crowded Starbucks and shrugs with an expression of something like distaste. &quot;To be honest,&quot; he says, &quot;I don&apos;t like democracy. In fact, I hate it. I don&apos;t like the food, the clothes ... my ideal is a traditional Chinese one, of sitting in a boat on a lake in the moonlight, with some friends and a drink. But,&quot; he concludes, &quot;I think people deserve their rights, and I&apos;ve spent my life paying for them.&quot; Gaby Wood &apos;We didn&apos;t have the experience to feel fear&apos;     Wang Dan photographed at The British Museum&#13; Photograph: Jim Powell    Wang Dan was a key organiser of the democracy protests. Made China&apos;s number one Most Wanted after the crackdown, he spent 10 years in prison. He fled to the US and is now studying at Oxford. It seems absurd that a skinny, bespectacled student who had barely turned 20 should be ranked number one on a Most Wanted list of leaders sought for &quot;counter-revolutionary rebellion&quot; - but Wang Dan was portrayed as the mastermind behind the events of 4 June.  In fact, he was not. But his resistance to the authorities endured even after his arrest and imprisonment. When he left prison in 1993, he was certain he would return. &quot;I already knew there would be a second time, because I didn&apos;t want to give up and the government would not be tolerant,&quot; he says. &quot;With the student movement in &apos;89 we didn&apos;t achieve anything and friends lost their lives. I had an obligation to continue their dream.&quot;  Studying at liberal Beijing University, he had already created a democracy salon, and was naturally drawn into protests the following year. &quot;We were very young - I don&apos;t think we knew the true meaning of democracy,&quot; he recalls. &quot;We hoped we could have freedom - not necessarily the right to vote, but a free life. That was our understanding.&quot; One event in particular proved a turning point that spring: the now notorious People&apos;s Daily editorial accusing the students of creating turmoil. Intended to cow protestors, it instead provoked huge demonstrations.  &quot;It was the first time when the government told people not to go on the streets and they went anyway. We were making history.&quot; Yet the demonstrators had little idea what they were getting into. &quot;I don&apos;t think we were brave. We didn&apos;t have the experience to feel fear.&quot;  He was at the university when friends called him to tell him the military were shooting people in the streets. &quot;For several days I was totally numb. I never believed the government could do this,&quot; he says. While others escaped overseas, he stayed, still hoping that reformists would somehow triumph within the leadership. His arrest was an odd relief after weeks of hiding, though his family would bear the brunt too; his mother was jailed for 50 days. He plays down his own years in custody: &quot;I was a special case - I drew attention from the international community. They didn&apos;t beat me. They treated me OK. &quot;Workers were put to death. The treatment of students was better than the workers and ordinary citizens; they were the real victims.&quot;  Freed in 1993, he was back in jail within two years, this time sentenced to 11 years for criticising the government and attempting to organise. US pressure won him &quot;medical parole&quot; in 1998, but his escape to the US was bitter-sweet, since he could not return to China. He completed his studies at Harvard and is currently a visiting scholar at Oxford. He remains an outspoken critic of the government.

It began in his youth, in 1975, when he spoke out to support Deng Xiaoping \u2013 purged for a second time by Mao Zedong \u2013 and was sentenced to reform through labour. At the end of the decade, he helped to found the Beijing Spring magazine during a brief flourishing of political freedoms. Later, he took a leading role in experimental direct elections.  &quot;I was first in prison in my 20s ... I had already decided to devote myself to a career of freedom and democracy in China. Although I was caught a few times later, these ideals established in my youth cannot be changed,&quot; he says. In the mid-1980s, he launched the country&apos;s first private thinktank: the progressive Beijing Social and Economic Research Institute, which published the challenging Economics Weekly. But experience had made him wary as well as determined. &quot;Because of that, I acted very cautiously [in 1989]. I knew if I did anything, they would have something to say about it.&quot;  He was not cautious enough. He spent 13 years in prison and under house arrest as one of the &quot;black hands&quot; blamed for the Tiananmen protests. To this day, police watch his flat in the Beijing suburbs. &quot;Nothing to worry about,&quot; he says calmly. Now in his 50s, Chen is hardly a firebrand, but very much the academic. He speaks in long, carefully structured paragraphs with numerous elucidatory clauses \u2013 and a hint of humour. He says that in 1989 he simply offered advice to inexperienced students who had sought his help, as reformers in the leadership leant towards dialogue (others suggest that downplays his role, but stress he was a mediator between parties, not a leader). &quot;What happened next was really out of our expectations. Zhao Ziyang [the pro-reform general secretary] lost his job and people like us were put into prison. It wasn&apos;t a preordained outcome,&quot; he maintains.  &quot;[The student leaders] were naive. They didn&apos;t really believe the communist party could shoot them or put them in prison ... Sadly, because there&apos;s no article about 6/4 [the date of the crackdown] allowed on the net, no publication about it, students of this generation possibly could make the same mistakes.&quot; He was at home when the shooting began: &quot;Of course I felt very angry. Most of the Beijing citizens felt angry. Our neighbours gathered to talk about events and an old lady said, there have been three changes of dynasty [from the Qing to the Republic of China, the Japanese invasion, and the People&apos;s Republic] and they were not as bloody as this.&quot; Soon afterwards, the authorities released the &quot;most wanted&quot; student warrant and another naming leading intellectuals. Chen, warned that his name would appear on the second list, had already fled but was caught in southern China. Others had escaped overseas. &quot;I felt I hadn&apos;t done anything wrong or broken the law so of course I could stay in China. Both me and Wang Juntao [his long term friend and colleague, now living in the US] had experience of being in prison so neither of us was that scared of it. The government had to send some intellectuals as scapegoats, so we thought, why don&apos;t we take that role?&quot; he says. He had no idea how long he would serve, &quot;but I thought, they even shot students in the square, so it couldn&apos;t be short. My wife was imprisoned for 400 days as well ... She was told that it was uncertain whether her husband would live or not.&quot; He thinks that attention from the international community helped to lighten his sentence.  Chen acknowledges the &quot;great progress&quot; made in his years in detention. But while economic freedoms have expanded, he thinks political rights and freedom of expression have been squeezed. In 2004 he won permission to set up the Reform and Reconstruction website with a friend \u2013 but once it garnered a following, it was shut down. Now hosted on a foreign server, it cannot be accessed from China.  &quot;Even before 1989, you could have private publications ... Our comments and content were much more independent and better than the ones they have now and the central government never really bothered us about what to write and not to write,&quot; he recalls. &quot;Now they have very strict controls. Where is that free spirit of the past?&quot; Tania Branigan &apos;The government finally and totally lost their legitimacy&apos;     Novelist Ma Jian photographed at his West London home. Photograph: =/Richard Saker    Ma Jian, 55, is a novelist. His books include Red Dust, The Noodle Maker and Beijing Coma. He spent six weeks in spring 1989 living with protestors in the tent city in Tiananmen Square. He now lives and writes in London. Ma Jian has travelled a long way during the past 20 years but his heart remains in the country he has left behind. &quot;Living in London is like being on a luxury cruise liner,&quot; he said recently. &quot;It&apos;s very comfortable but I&apos;m not in control of where it&apos;s going and I don&apos;t have both feet on the ground. This is something I can only ever feel in China.&quot; Ma is allowed to return to China but with the proviso that he does not speak in public. His books are banned there.  They were already banned and branded as &quot;spiritual pollution&quot; long before the Tiananmen crackdown: he had spent years travelling through remote parts of China adopting various identities to avoid police surveillance before he arrived at the tent city. After the protests, he feared for his life and fled to Hong Kong. Then, when censorship was ramped up after the 1997 handover, he moved to Germany. A year later he decamped to London where he now lives with his wife, the translator Flora Drew, although he still speaks very little English. Described by Nobel laureate Gao Xingjian as &quot;one of the most important and courageous voices in Chinese literature&quot;, he has written on many subjects during the past two decades but it was only recently that he felt able to draw on his experiences during spring 1989.  The resulting novel, Beijing Coma - translated into English by Drew - was published last year to wide acclaim. It tells the story of a man who lies in a coma for a decade after being shot in the events of 1989, his mind racing while his country falls collectively into a stupor. This, in Ma&apos;s view, is what has happened in China over the past 20 years: despite the apparent loosening of restrictions, he feels he has witnessed the &quot;stupefaction of a nation&quot;. &quot;Although on the surface much seems to have changed the thought control still exists,&quot; he says, over tea in a Kilburn cafe, &quot;In essence nothing is different. The Chinese people have grown a hard protective shell under which they hide their thoughts and ideas. Since the Tiananmen protests the universities have become the most heavily policed parts of society. They are now hotbeds of hyper nationalism and love of the party,&quot; he says sadly. Growing up in Quingdao, a sea port in south east China as a young Communist Party pioneer he was taken to watch public executions, saw his teacher beaten by classmates, and joined in book burnings. &quot;There was no space to form an objective critical attitude to what I was being fed,&quot; he recalls. It was only through working as a photojournalist in his twenties that he &quot;gradually awoke to the fact that what was happening was wrong.&quot;Twenty years on, Ma still feels that the Tiananmen Protest was a triumph for the people and marked a sea change in the history of China. &quot;Differences in opinion about how things were done should not undermine the huge nobility of what occurred.  &quot;With the crackdown, the government finally and totally lost their legitimacy. They don&apos;t even believe in themselves any more.&quot; &quot;And the Chinese people showed they would sacrifice their lives in the name of freedom.&quot;Tom Templeton \u2022 Beijing Coma by Ma Jian is published by Vintage. &apos;I sued the government over my detention&apos;     Shao Jiang photographed at Westminster University, London. Photograph: Richard Saker    Shao Jiang, 42, is a PhD student in political science at Westminster University and runs a blog on Amnesty International&apos;s website in support of human rights in China. A key player in the protests, he was named on the notorious Most Wanted list and imprisoned repeatedly in China during the ten years following the Tiananmen crackdown.  Shao Jiang has devoted the last 20 years to honouring the lives of those who died in the protests of spring 1989. &quot;My life doesn&apos;t belong to me anymore, it belongs to them,&quot; he says, referring to those who died in the bloody denouement of the 1989 protests. He is a small man with cropped hair, oval spectacles and a ready sense of humour. Perhaps as a result of the things he has witnessed he seems to see life as Kafkaesquely absurd and deadly serious at the same time.  He spent three months on the run following the massacre before being captured. He then endured 18 months of interrogation in detention centres from Guangdong to Beijing. &quot;Like many students I didn&apos;t get beaten as badly as the workers, they were punished the worst.&quot; When he was finally released he knew exactly what to do with his new-found freedom. &quot;I sued the government over my detention, I wrote letters and essays and criticised the government&apos;s failure to reform politically. Too many people had died not to continue the struggle for political reform.&quot;Regularly jailed, placed under house arrest, and trailed when free, Shao was unable to get a job, as secret police leaned on potential employers. They then tried to bribe him. &quot;They wanted to control me in any way they could, but I refused.&quot;Shao eventually escaped China, first to Sweden and then to London, though he will not discuss the route, just in case it causes trouble for those who helped him. In 2003, working in IT and researching a PhD in China&apos;s underground publications, Shao heard that his mother had suffered a severe stroke. He received a message from the Chinese police that he could return to visit her if he renounced his former actions. &quot;Of course I couldn&apos;t do it,&quot; he says, and smiles. Shao&apos;s participation in the Tiananmen Square protests began back in 1985, a week after his arrival at Beijing University when he attended a debate headlined: &quot;Why won&apos;t the government allow political reform?&quot;  It was the opening salvo in a four-year battle between students and government, including arrests, blacklisting, sham elections, marches and rallies. At the same time Shao and his fellow students studied Locke, Montesquieu and Gandhi, the Prague Spring and Hungarian revolution, and Chinese thinkers Fang Lizhi, Wei Jingsheng and Hu Ping. After Hu Yaobang&apos;s death everyone headed to the Square. &quot;I thought we needed specific demands. As we walked I wrote down a list and checked it with my fellow students. When we got to the square we handed in and then shouted our demands at the Congress.&quot; By the time the army advanced Shao and his friend Liu Gang had spent five days trying to convince people to leave Tiananmen Square: &quot;I felt the best long-term move was retreat. I saw the army start shooting civilians. We had never imagined anything like this. To kill their own people, their own nationality. I helped get some of the wounded onto tricycles, to be taken to hospital. People shouted &apos;fascists&apos; , &apos;murderers&apos; \u2013 and were mown down. &quot;This guy wearing a white coat walked slowly towards the wounded saying to the soldiers, &apos;Don&apos;t kill me, I&apos;m a doctor.&apos; They shot him dead. It was truly terrible. &quot;Then the army said over loudspeakers that if people didn&apos;t leave by 7am they would clear the square by any means necessary, so we got the hell out. When I got back a friend said &apos;What happened to your T-shirt?&apos; It had brains and blood on it. I don&apos;t know whose.&quot; Tom Templeton"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/may/04/netbooks-acer-aspire-one", "publicationDate": "2009-05-04T22:57:37Z", "tags": ["Netbooks", "Microsoft", "Technology", "Acer", "Asus"], "sentences": ["Acer is about to start shipping Aspire One netbooks with 11.6 inch screens -- I&apos;m expecting a short term loaner this week -- and Asus will have a model later this month, according to DigiTimes in Taiwan."], "title": "Netbooks are going to 11.6-inch screens", "article": "Acer is about to start shipping Aspire One netbooks with 11.6 inch screens -- I&apos;m expecting a short term loaner this week -- and Asus will have a model later this month, according to DigiTimes in Taiwan.  Both systems run the ultra-cheap version of Windows XP, which has only been available for use on netbooks with up to 10 inch screens. Apparently Microsoft has been persuaded to move the goalposts in the light of what both Acer and Asus tell me is a consumer demand for bigger screens. &quot;The real limitation now is that it cannot be more than 12 inches,&quot; says Massimo D&apos;Angelo, the Acer vice president in charge of Europe.  Dell, of course, may have been instrumental in this: it is offering the Dell Inspiron Mini 12 with a 12.1-inch screen. Asus has also shown me a system with a &quot;12 inch screen&quot;. I won&apos;t be shocked if all these screens turn out to be the same size when I get chance to measure them.Acer showed 11.6 inch Aspire One 751 at its press conference in London last week. It looks like earlier models, but it&apos;s a little thinner (about an inch or less) and has a full-size keyboard. It also has an Intel Atom processor (Z530 or Z520), 1GB of memory, a 160GB hard drive, a webcam, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, three USB Ports and a multi-touch keypad. It can take an embedded SIM for mobile 3G communications. The external casing comes in several colours. Acer reckons you&apos;ll get around 8 hours of battery life, so if you carry a spare (which I do) then you&apos;ll get all-day computing without ever having to worry about running out of power. As always, I asked Massimo about Linux, since Acer had been gung-ho about it when the Aspire One was launched. Of course, netbook manufacturers never actually tell you, because it&apos;s regarded as competitive information. Still, I asked: &quot;What proportion of your netbooks now ship with Linux?&quot; &quot;Now? It&apos;s very very minimal,&quot; he said. &quot;Less than 10%?&quot; &quot;Very very minimal\u2026&quot; &quot;Less than 5%?&quot; &quot;Very very minimal\u2026&quot; &quot;Less than\u2026&quot; I was going to say 2% but at that point he decided to do something more interesting. But he was nodding as he left.  Among the problems: too many versions of Linux, too many driver and driver installation problems for too many types of mobile dongle, qualifying all of them for 24 of the world&apos;s top 25 telcos, and the telcos&apos; general unwillingness to support Linux. From this, you can deduce that the telcos are the key to profitable volume sales in the netbook market, at least for Acer."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/may/05/netbooks-defined", "publicationDate": "2009-05-05T22:48:40Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Windows", "Netbooks", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Six Taiwanese notebook makers are now preparing to launch CULV-based ultra-thin notebooks for the white-box market, according to DigiTimes in Taiwan."], "title": "Netbooks, screen sizes, CULV, and Apple's 'netbook'", "article": "I&apos;ve been asked a reasonable question: &quot;How big a screen means you&apos;re not a netbook any more?&quot; The answer, of course, is that it depends how you define a netbook. And there are at least three key definitions.  First, a netbook is a cheap portable computer that fits the definition of an ULCPC (ultra-low cost personal computer), under which Microsoft provides a cheap version called Windows XP Home Edition ULCPC, optimised for small machines. Since we&apos;re not Microsoft customers, we don&apos;t know exactly what this definition entails. However, looking at netbooks on the market, it clearly allows for an Intel Atom processor (there are alternatives), 1GB of memory, a 160GB hard drive and a 12-inch screen. This definition has changed since it first appeared. It used to allow an 80GB hard drive and screen sizes up to 10 inches.If Microsoft decided to change the definition again \u2013 under pressure from its PC partners, perhaps -- it could allow screen sizes up to 13.3 inches. If it did, there would be a flood of 13.3in netbooks. But this is unlikely, because most PC manufacturers charge less for netbooks than they do for notebooks, and they make less money on them. Allowing 13.3in screens would hit most PC manufacturers&apos; profits, not just Microsoft&apos;s. Of course, PC manufacturers can make any type of portable PC they like, with whatever specification they want. They can load it with any operating system they choose, if it&apos;s legally available. However, if they want to load it with XP Home ULCPC at about a third of the price of Vista, they have to meet the ULCPC spec, just as they would for Tablet PC Edition or whatever. Their choice. The second definition of a netbook is a functional one. A netbook is a cheap portable computer that is suitable for using net-based applications such as Gmail and Zoho. It is not designed to run large desktop applications, and certainly not for multi-tasking them. It is optimised for long battery life, not for performance. Under this definition, it doesn&apos;t matter what the screen size is. The problem is that a big screen will use more power (shortening battery life) and be much less portable than a small screen, so netbooks will tend to have smaller screens than notebooks. The Intel Atom chip is suitable for netbooks because it is small, cheap and very efficient (long battery life) but not very powerful. If you want to run large applications, or multi-task, then you&apos;re much better off with a 64-bit Core 2 Duo (410 million transistors, 3MB L2 cache) than a 32-bit Atom (47m transistors, 512K L2 cache). Another major drawback with the Atom is that it can&apos;t handle out-of-order instructions. The Atom wins in power consumption (4W instead of 65W). Most ordinary people don&apos;t run demanding desktop applications, unless they&apos;re into video processing or gaming, and they don&apos;t actually do much multi-tasking so an Atom is often good enough. (Indeed, much more powerful Atom chips are on the way, though it remains to be seen just how far Intel will push the design.) The Atom&apos;s limitations make sense because it was designed for use in what Intel calls MIDs, for Mobile Internet Devices. It was targeted at delivering all-day use with systems that have 4-6 inch screens -- just a bit below Intel&apos;s UMPC (Ultra Mobile PC), aka Microsoft&apos;s Origami, which targeted 5-7 inch screens. It just happened to arrive when PC manufacturers were looking for small cheap chips for netbooks. The third definition actually trumps the other two: a netbook is anything the manufacturer decides to call a netbook. The Sony P Series, for example, is not a netbook because Sony says so. It&apos;s right: it doesn&apos;t have an Atom processor or a ULCPC copy of Windows XP. The Asus N10 isn&apos;t a netbook either; it&apos;s a portable PC, even though it does have an Atom processor. It&apos;s made by Asus&apos;s laptop division, not its Eee PC division.  In the end, you just have to accept that life is fuzzy: there is no hard and fast definition of a netbook. But as a matter of fact, most netbooks fit all three of the definitions above. The situation is about to get a little more complicated with the arrival of CULV (Consumer Ultra Low Voltage) systems such as the Acer Timeline range. These fit the space between netbooks and traditional notebooks. They have super-efficient chipsets and hardware designs to provide long battery life, but they use Core 2 Solo or Duo chips, run Vista or Windows 7, and can have screens as big as you like. I&apos;ve written about CULV systems in this week&apos;s column, which will be in the Technology section on Thursday. CULV designs are pretty much what used to be sold as ultraportables for travelling business executives to use on planes. The main models included IBM&apos;s X series and Toshiba&apos;s Prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, with Apple&apos;s MacBook Air being a late arrival on the scene. The difference is that they used to cost $2,000 to $3,000, whereas CULV systems should cost around $750-$1,000, or less. Six Taiwanese notebook makers are now preparing to launch CULV-based ultra-thin notebooks for the white-box market, according to DigiTimes in Taiwan. These are Pegatron Technology (part of Asus Group), Clevo, Micro-Star International (MSI), Compal Electronics, Elitegroup (ECS) and Mitac. If you want to badge-engineer a CULV notebook, now&apos;s your chance. Another interesting thing is that CULV designs provide an opportunity for Apple to provide a &quot;netbook&quot; that&apos;s lighter and has much better battery life than a MacBook Air for much less than half the price. And although parts are in somewhat variable supply, it could do it in July. Whether Apple actually wants to compete with Acer and Asus is another matter. It could just use the more modern CULV technology to redo the kludge that is the MacBook Air."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/may/05/china-child-trafficking-heathrow", "publicationDate": "2009-05-05T22:56:44Z", "tags": ["Child protection", "Prostitution", "Drugs trade", "Immigration and asylum", "Crime", "UK news", "China", "World news", "Society", "Organised crime", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["This province in the south-east of the People&apos;s Republic enjoys strong trade with Taiwan, but has earned a reputation as the Chinese centre of people trafficking."], "title": "People trafficking: a phone call, a car door opens - and another child vanishes", "article": "Squeezed between a rundown hotel and an unloved cottage, the block of flats at the perimeter of Heathrow airport is about as anonymous as a children&apos;s home can get. The only sign of youthful life is a broken five-a-side football goal on the driveway. The youngsters who live here have been intercepted by the Border and Immigration Agency. About half of them are Chinese children on their way to a life of exploitation in prostitution, the drugs trade and illegal unpaid labour in London and beyond. They are suspected victims of trafficking and given the danger they are in, this block of 59 rooms should be the safest place in the world \u2013 but it isn&apos;t. According to an internal intelligence report obtained by the Guardian, at least 77 Chinese children have gone missing from this place since March 2006 and the authorities believe they have fallen straight back into the hands of their \u00adtraffickers. They are picked up with \u00adastonishing ease. &quot;The last absconder we heard of was a girl who came in through the front door and went straight out the [other] side,&quot; said a police source. &quot;The social workers just heard the car door shutting and the car pulling off and she was gone. It was panic stations. It was clear she&apos;d called her handler and they had co-ordinated it.&quot; Sometimes individuals the authorities suspect to be traffickers walk up to the intercom at the front door and ask after the whereabouts of their victim, according to an official who helps run the home. The report into the loss of Chinese \u00adchildren from care at Heathrow provides the most detailed picture yet of the \u00adChinese child trafficking into the UK operated by organised crime networks with tentacles as far apart as Sao Paulo, Nairobi and Malaysia. It shows how immigration officers believe organised crime groups have exploited the relatively unsecure centre at Heathrow as a kind of clearing house for their trade in children. And it reveals concern that not enough has been done by the police to investigate and prosecute those responsible. The story starts in Fujian for most of the children who arrive at Heathrow. This province in the south-east of the People&apos;s Republic enjoys strong trade with Taiwan, but has earned a reputation as the Chinese centre of people trafficking. The 23 cockle pickers who died in \u00adMorecambe Bay came from there and the largest number of Chinese illegal immigrants in the US are said to be from the province. In recent years more and more of its young people have been sent to the UK to work in the labour-hungry illegal industries of prostitution and drug production \u2013 cannabis in particular \u2013 in which Chinese criminal gangs are active. The traffickers, known as snakeheads in China, prefer &quot;the use of circuitous and multi-stage routes to the UK&quot; to make it difficult to for the authorities to link \u00advictims to their traffickers, the report states. That certainly seems to be borne out by what is known of the itineraries of the Heathrow victims. Two have been linked to travel agencies in Florence and Milan while a named Chinese travel agency is linked to at least four cases who came from China via other European airports. Last year the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca) disrupted a \u00adsuspected \u00adtrafficking ring operating through \u00adManchester airport in which Chinese \u00adchildren were routed through Italy. In several cases the children appear to have travelled with the assistance of a suspected boarding card swapper from Japan named in the document, who puts them on planes to London from the far east. The swapping system is another ruse to shake the authorities off. Another child arrived with the help of two Malaysian facilitators while three more came via \u00adNairobi having bought \u00adtickets from the same Kenya Airways agent using cash. But the longest route, clocking up 17,500 miles, was taken by six children who flew across the Pacific via Brazil. At least two children are known to have been aided by a man and a woman who act as facilitators and organised flights on the Brazilian airline TAM from Sao Paulo to London. A &quot;threat assessment&quot; of child trafficking published last month by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Agency (Ceop) makes clear that the trafficking process can take up to a year, with victims sometimes being forced to pay off some of their bonded debt before being transported to their final destination. Being trafficked is not cheap. Debts have risen to \u00a340,000 in at least one case noted by Ceop. In some cases children adopted the identities of Chinese students with valid leave to remain in the UK, but more often they destroyed their \u00adpaperwork in transit before they arrived at the UK in an effort to cover their tracks and, in some cases, to mask the fact that they are in fact 18 or older, which means they would stand less chance of staying in the UK. Once in London the border officials, if satisfied that an unaccompanied arrival may be under 18, hand over the child to the social services and they are taken to the discrete processing centre which is five minutes drive from Terminal 5. &quot;Typically a Chinese young person will seek to contact a &apos;relative&apos; at an address or restaurant premises,&quot; states the report. &quot;Some of the addresses used by them are already of interest to the Border and Immigration Agency in relation to other adult Chinese immigration offenders.&quot; Two addresses often provided are a single London hotel and a secluded suburban street of semi-detached homes in Haringey, north London, which has a Chinese population of around 2,500. At least one Chinese family is accommodated in a block of flats on the street. Otherwise there are few leads as to where the childrenmight go. &quot;It is very difficult to get information out of these people,&quot; said Detective Inspector Gordon Valentine, who heads the Metropolitan police&apos;s child trafficking unit. &quot;They are afraid of the traffickers and they are afraid of retribution against their families back home if they talk.&quot; &quot;There is an intelligence black hole,&quot; added Peter Clark, the Chinatown community police officer in London who hears of one or two cases of absconded Chinese children every week. They disappear into the community and they are gone. We think that most of the children go into cannabis cultivation all over the country from Scotland to Cornwall.&quot; The report states: &quot;The concerns are that with the organised nature of Chinese illegal immigration, the absconding is at the behest of trafficking or facilitation organised crime groups and the \u00adchildren may be exploited for financial gain.&quot; It seems it is not by chance that traffickers regain control of these children. In fact everyone, from police to social workers, appears to know what happens here beside the \u00adrunway. Soon after a child arrives, in most cases within 48 hours, he or she calls their \u00adtrafficker on a pre-programmed mobile phone they have brought with them, they pack their bag and either walk out the front door or jump from one of the sliding bedroom windows, many of which are conveniently located on the ground floor. Room 12 seems to be a popular jumping-off point \u2013 four absconded from there recently, says the report. The authorities think a waiting car usually whisks them away. However, the borough of Hillingdon believes it has now started to fight back. &quot;There are still a large proportion of Chinese children who go missing, but the numbers are going down,&quot; said deputy director of children&apos;s services at Hillingdon, Julian Worcester. &quot;We now carry out a risk assessment looking at whether the young person is vulnerable in the UK. We vet telephone calls and confiscate mobile phones and this has had an impact.&quot; But he said Hillingdon remains \u00adpowerless to stop children leaving \u00adaltogether because it would have to obtain a court order proving that a child is in immediate danger to keep them. He said this was not practical and has urged the government to target the source with a diplomatic campaign led by the Foreign Office to urge the \u00adChinese authorities to clamp down on the traffickers. There is no suggestion that anyone with adminstrative responsibility for the home facilitates the trafficking operation. Soca believes the recent disruption may have been due to the Beijing Olympics and the tighter immigration controls in China that came with the games. If true, \u00adbusiness as usual may be about to start again. Across the UK, 20% of all the suspected victims of trafficking who have been taken into care are missing and there have been no convictions of Chinese traffickers under a trafficking offence where a child has been a victim. This failure now worries the United Nations rapporteur on human trafficking, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo. &quot;When I look at the legal aspects there are gaps,&quot; she said. &quot;Trafficking victims need to be treated \u00addifferently from irregular migrants. That is not happening well, especially when the victims are not willing to co-operate. &quot;The authorities are not mindful of the trauma the victims have experienced and the real threats to their lives. Too often the victims are just treated as illegal \u00adimmigrants. There is also a lack of \u00adcapacity among the authorities to identify the \u00advictims and this needs to be looked at.&quot; That lack of capacity may have had a serious effect on attempts to safeguard the Chinese children of Heathrow. For a while a surveillance operation was in place at the home to see who was \u00adpicking up the children. But according to the leaked report, it was cancelled in \u00adFebruary 2008."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/07/swin-flu-rebranding", "publicationDate": "2009-05-07T13:00:00Z", "tags": ["Swine flu", "Health", "Health policy", "Egypt", "Politics", "The meat industry", "Animal welfare", "Environment", "World news", "Flu", "Life and style", "Africa"], "sentences": ["Taiwan calls it &quot;new flu&quot;, the European commission uses &quot;novel flu virus&quot; and the World Health Organisation &quot;Influenza A (H1N1)&quot;."], "title": "Swine flu needs to be rebranded | Duncan Turnbull", "article": "Last month Sainsbury&apos;s renamed pollack, the white fish useful as an alternative to cod, Colin.

The 1918 pandemic was named Spanish flu, but some scientists believe it started in Kansas. The genetic structure of the 2009 disease is very similar to that of swine influenza, a malady that causes fever and (increased) lethargy in pigs, and as a result, &quot;swine flu&quot; stuck. However, intense lobbying from the US pig industry is making people question the relevance of pigs in this crisis. In Book Three of the Republic, Plato writes that doctors are forced to give &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;newfangled&quot; names to diseases. Nowadays it is more likely for the media to do the naming, one consequence of which is the emergence of a panoply of misnomers which mislead and confuse the public. In doing so, they may cause untold economic harm to an innocent section of the economy. It is thought that swine flu may have come from one of the industrialised and intensive pig farms in Mexico. However, the point is that this strain of flu is passed from human to human. Pigs no longer play any role in viral transmission and the newly mutated H1N1 virus is not found in them. Pigs do not spread the flu, nor can you catch swine flu from pork products. Given this knowledge, calling the disease &quot;swine flu&quot;, &quot;pigfluenza&quot; or &quot;pig flu&quot; seem tenuous at best. Yaakov Litzman, a deputy health minister of Israel, went even further, saying &quot;swine flu&quot; is an offensive term as it refers to animals which are unclean in the Jewish and Islamic faiths. &quot;We will call it Mexico flu. We won&apos;t call it swine flu,&quot; Litzman stated, somewhat to the dismay of Mexicans. Taiwan calls it &quot;new flu&quot;, the European commission uses &quot;novel flu virus&quot; and the World Health Organisation &quot;Influenza A (H1N1)&quot;. At the end of the day, referring to it as &quot;swine flu&quot; is more than just tenuous; it is misleading and potentially dangerous. In Egypt the health minister, Hatem al-Gabali, bizarrely ordered the cull of 350,000 pigs. Four days later, hundred of Christian pig farmers rioted in Cairo, exchanging stones for tear gas with police. If the aim of the Egyptian government was to prevent panic then it seems it has not worked; if their aim was to prevent large groups of people coming into close contact with each other to prevent the spread of disease, then it has been a disaster. As one commentator said, only their capriciousness tops their ignorance. The last four days of April saw strong losses in the pork markets with lean hogs and pork bellies falling by as much as 10%. Evidence like this supports the view that such a careless naming may have dire consequences for a pig industry which has taken its fair share of pain over the past five years. As the chief veterinary officer at the UN says, &quot;it is not a swine influenza, it&apos;s a human influenza&quot;. Swine flu is spread by people, not pigs. It would be a great shame if the rebranding of swine flu to something more neutral comes too late."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2009/may/08/didier-drogba-tom-henning-ovrebo-footwear", "publicationDate": "2009-05-08T14:11:20Z", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport", "Didier Drogba"], "sentences": ["&quot;Taiwan participant Wang misses Australia&apos;s &apos;best job&apos;&quot;, said the website eTaiwan News."], "title": "Didier Drogba really put his foot in it by wearing flip-flops, writes Simon Burnton", "article": "Didier Drogba is going to get in an awful lot of trouble after his wild-eyed, foul-mouthed rant at Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo following Chelsea&apos;s Champions League defeat to Barcelona this week \u2013 and quite rightly so. After all, he was wearing flip-flops. Perhaps they could better be described as slide shoes. There was no thong between the Ivorian&apos;s toes, if that is the flip-flop&apos;s defining characteristic. What&apos;s for sure is that they were designed to be worn pool-side, not pitch-side. On a Caribbean break they would have been just the ticket, but at a football match on a cold night in west London they were completely unsuitable. It&apos;s like running the marathon in a diving suit: people might do it for charity, but otherwise it&apos;s a bit weird. Giving Drogba the benefit of the doubt, it&apos;s possible he simply got confused over English idiom. Perhaps he was told that his actions were going to land him in hot water and simply wanted to be appropriately shod. You wonder if this was why Drogba was booked. The Norwegian official must have been sympathetic to the complaints about his own performance \u2013 after all, soon after the game he admitted he had messed up and went into hiding, hardly the actions of an innocent man. But he may well have taken umbrage at a player entering the field of play without the proper footwear as stipulated in Fifa&apos;s Laws of the Game. For many neutrals the initial reaction to Chelsea&apos;s defeat might have been pity, because they played well and should have been given lots of penalties. But perhaps it is the evening&apos;s designated villain who truly deserves our sympathy, because while the Chelsea players are terrifically good at what they do and know they have a good chance of reaching the final next year, neither statement is true of the referee. But instead of blaming Ovrebo&apos;s poor performance on his manifest individual inadequacies, many instead focused on his nationality. &quot;I don&apos;t know why we can&apos;t have the best ref from Germany or Italy,&quot; sniffed Jamie Redknapp on Sky. &quot;How many big games has he reffed in Norway?&quot; Why, Jamie, just last week 9,458 people witnessed Ovrebo&apos;s masterly handling of Stabaek&apos;s goalless draw against Lyn, the hotly contested battle between the teams currently lying 12th and 15th in the Norwegian Eliteserien. Though our football teams, with their multinational selection of staff and owners, have lost all but the most arbitrary connection to their locations, nationality remains strangely central to us. Not just in sport, either. This week Ben Southall, a charity worker from Hampshire, was chosen ahead of 15 rival candidates to become the caretaker of Hamilton Island, in the Great Barrier Reef, after a lengthy and high-profile selection process which, unlike any job interview I&apos;ve ever been involved in, largely involved being massaged and fed lobster. &quot;Briton lands &apos;world&apos;s best job&apos;&quot;, read the Guardian&apos;s headline. &quot;Irishman misses out on &apos;best job in the world&apos;&quot;, wrote the Belfast Telegraph. &quot;Dallas woman makes short list, but doesn&apos;t land &apos;best job in the world&apos;&quot;, said the Dallas Morning News. &quot;Taiwan participant Wang misses Australia&apos;s &apos;best job&apos;&quot;, said the website eTaiwan News. &quot;Vancouver journalist loses shot at best job&quot;, was the headline on Canada.com, though papers in the country revelled in Briton&apos;s plan to share the island with his Canadian girlfriend, Bre. And so the story spread around the world, everyone knowing precisely what happened to their local representative and caring not a jot about anyone else. The coverage taught us something else: elite professional footballers are normally accused of having the best job in the world, but it turns out that their pressurised if well paid existence is not as appealing as lounging about on your own private beach. Which is perhaps why, in his hour of anguish, Drogba slipped off his boots, slid on his flip-flops and transported his feet to a happier place."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/10/china-foreign-currency-reserves", "publicationDate": "2009-05-10T22:57:45Z", "tags": ["China", "Global economy", "Global recession", "Business", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["China&apos;s investments last year in Costa Rica appear to have been made on condition that the country shifted its allegiance from Taiwan to the People&apos;s Republic of China."], "title": "Beijing's capital ideas", "article": "While much of the world sinks in a welter of public and \u00adprivate debt, and stock \u00admarkets \u00adcontinue to \u00adstruggle, there is one place where the money is still looking good. China&apos;s \u00a32\u00a0trillion of\u00a0foreign currency reserves \u2013 accrued through two decades of strong exports and foreign investment \u2013 is \u00adcasting a long shadow. While the developed world has spent, China has been saving. This mountain of capital, in the hands of the world&apos;s last major one-party state, is the result partly of the non-convertibility of the Chinese currency, the yuan, and part of the hunger of the EU and the US in the last decade for cheap goods from China. And as the G20 in April made clear, \u00adhaving helped China build up this mountain of money, it now expects \u00adBeijing to contribute some of these riches towards solving the current \u00adglobal economic crisis. The question is how much will China play along with this. Having this much money, as the \u00adChinese premier, Wen Jiabao, admitted a year ago, is a mixed blessing. A weak dollar back then meant that billions were wiped off the value of these reserves (70% of the money is kept in dollars). The strengthening of the \u00addollar\u00a0has solved that problem, for the moment. But the challenge to Chinese policymakers of how to use this money remains \u2013 and using a universal \u00adcurrency, as one Chinese minister \u00adspeculated earlier this year, only solves the problem of currency depreciation. It does nothing about what use to actually put this capital to. There is one clear area where the \u00adChinese can, and are, using their money: overseas investment. China now ranks as the world&apos;s sixth largest outward \u00adinvestor, according to the UN \u00adConference on Trade and Development. Even this figure is almost certainly an underes-timate. Chinese financial institutions have significant minority shareholdings in US and European financial institutions. In 2008 the UK overtook Germany as the largest destination for outward-bound money. As one commentator has said, the era of Made in China is drawing to a close. The era of Owned by China is starting. And we had better be ready for a rapid transition. The Chinese government encourages its large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and some of its non-state companies to &quot;go out&quot;. The aim is to expose Chinese companies to international markets and to show others that China is not only interested in selling but also in investing and building globally competitive \u00adcompanies and brands. Partly as a result of this, China&apos;s global integration has moved up several notches in the last two years. The current economic crisis has accelerated this. Foreign governments ask two questions about Chinese investment. Will it be managed on a purely commercial, profit-driven basis? And will the Chinese government seek to use investments for political ends? The answers at present are mixed. China&apos;s investments last year in Costa Rica appear to have been made on condition that the country shifted its allegiance from Taiwan to the People&apos;s Republic of China. But the behaviour of Chinese SOEs has evolved considerably over the past decade. The government has made it clear that it expects them to\u00a0generate a return and pay dividends to the state. The top managers of \u00adChinese SOEs themselves have become\u00a0a lobby group in their own right,\u00a0seeking increasingly to maximise their own interests. The west needs to overcome its doubts about Chinese outward investment and recognise that a more \u00adwelcoming approach will bring not only\u00a0immediate economic gain, especially welcome at the moment, but also longer-term strategic benefits. The \u00adbenefits ought to be obvious. Western economies will receive much needed investment. The economic integration between China and the west will deepen. A powerful interest group within the Chinese elite will be drawn into fuller engagement with their western counterparts. And perhaps the west will find that the political influence of which it is most afraid works both ways. One thing is certain: some time in the\u00a0coming year, we have to expect a bold move from China. We had better make our minds up before then how we\u00a0are going to respond to this. Otherwise it will look as if we&apos;ve just allowed ourselves to be bought out. And that is in no one&apos;s interests.

China, the country that has based its development strategy on becoming the low-cost workshop for the world, was feeling the impact of an implosion in global trade caused by the financial crisis. Across Asia, empty container ships lay idly at anchor as consumer demand collapsed and stocks of manufactured products were run down. China had always expected \u2013 indeed, had planned \u2013 a slowdown in its economy once the 2008 Beijing Olympics finished, but it was not ready for the global collapse that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers last September. Suggestions that China might be able to decouple itself from the problems that originated in the US housing market proved fanciful. Having caught the flood tide of globalisation for a decade and a half, the world&apos;s most populous country was inevitably affected as the tide went out. Yet everything is relative. Beijing expects China&apos;s economy to expand by 8% this year \u2013 down on the explosive double-digit pace since the turn of the millennium, but a growth rate to die for if you are Gordon Brown, Barack Obama or Angela Merkel. Already there are signs that the government&apos;s fiscal boost \u2013 worth 16% of gross domestic product over two years \u2013 is having an impact. A country that for three decades has been a curious mix of Karl Marx and Adam Smith has now turned to John Maynard Keynes to speed its way out of the global downturn. &quot;Because of China&apos;s structure, the government has direct levers to spend money quickly,&quot; said Prof Peter Williamson, of the Judge Institute of Management in Cambridge. &quot;Whereas in Britain it can take years to get an infrastructure project going, in China things can happen immediately.&quot; Much of the stimulus package is planned investment that has been fast-tracked rather than new money, but Gerard Lyons, the chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, says it will make a difference. &quot;The reality is that Beijing has announced a lot of new measures and they have started to push these measures through. They have pulled out all the stops.&quot; Political structure The real issue for China, however, is not whether the state can push the growth rate back above 10% next year; the consensus among economists is that it certainly can. Periods of rapid growth are by no means exceptional in Asia: Taiwan grew at 9.4% a year for more than a quarter of a century after 1962; Singapore expanded at much the same pace between 1967 and 1993; Japan&apos;s purple patch was the period between 1960 and 1973, when its average growth rate was 10%-plus. But China faces three sets of challenges that will shape the way it \u2013 and the global economy \u2013 evolves over the next half century. At the root of everything lies the question of whether the country&apos;s political structure is conducive to sustained growth. In the west, the classic pattern of development has been for economic change to stimulate demands for political reform and greater democracy. Despite the arrival of designer labels to the glitzy shopping malls of Shanghai, China remains a one-party state and there is little evidence that the ruling Communist party has any intention of loosening its grip. Anxiety that rapidly rising unemployment, particularly among disaffected graduates, might put millions on the streets this summer demanding change, helps explain both the scale and the speed of China&apos;s economic stimulus. Memories of Tiananmen Square are still vivid for the policy elite in Beijing. But some economists believe the fear of political change will hold China back. Prof Andrew Tylecote, of Sheffield University, believes the top-down fiscal package exacerbated the fundamental weakness of the economy \u2013 its lack of a thriving private sector. &quot;You tell state-owned banks to lend more money and they will do so. You tell state-owned enterprises to take on more staff and borrow more money and they will do so. If you throw money at anything remotely shovel-ready in terms of infrastructure, you will have an impact. &quot;But what they are not doing is beefing up the private sector. The dynamism ought to be coming from the private sector, which has been hammered by the crisis yet is not being looked after by the stimulus or by the boosting of credit. The stimulus is going to produce a more top heavy, muscle-bound economy full of rather expensive, poorly-utilised equipment.&quot; China, though, is the country that pioneered paper, the compass, steel, the wheelbarrow, gunpowder, canals and a host of other innovations while western Europe was still struggling to emerge from the Dark Ages.  New challenges In more recent years, Chinese expats have taken their entrepreneurial skills around the world, and in the domestic market Chinese companies are about to overhaul western multinationals in patent filing for the first time. &quot;There is a lot of innovation,&quot; says Williamson. &quot;The really interesting companies are hybrids, which are 30% state owned and which get the best of both worlds \u2013 autonomy but support from the state. The idea that there is a Soviet Russia-style state sector is completely incorrect.&quot; Every bit of that innovation will be needed as China grapples with its next set of challenges, all of which \u2013 according to Lyons \u2013 relate to significant imbalances. These are the gap between living standards in the cities and in the countryside; the comparison between the wealth of the coastal strip and the poverty of the inland regions; the mismatch between the country&apos;s projected growth rate and its energy needs; the rudimentary social safety net which encourages the population to save rather than spend; and the way that lack of domestic consumption exacerbates tensions in the global economy between those countries that export too much and those that export too little. None of these challenges will be solved quickly or easily. China&apos;s energy needs are enormous, and it has started to channel part of its export earnings into sovereign wealth funds, which are now taking advantage of the global recession to buy up assets at knockdown prices. &quot;Cash-rich Chinese concerns are taking advantage of depressed asset prices and debt deleveraging in the resources sector to lock in future energy and resources needed for continued growth&quot;, said Jan Randolph, of IHS Global Insight. Recent coups have been &quot;loan-for-oil&quot; deals with Russia, Brazil and Kazakhstan; in Africa, China has helped build roads, railways and ports to secure access to the raw materials it needs to sustain its high growth rate. These needs are \u2013 and will remain \u2013 substantial. China is undergoing the most rapid urbanisation the world has ever seen and has 221 cities with a population of more than 1 million. To put that in perspective, Europe has 35. The gap in living standards between those living in the cities and the rural population is large and growing: China&apos;s development has been accompanied by a widening of income inequality. Welfare state costs Yet because it is unusual in experiencing the problems of both a developing and developed country \u2013 high growth and an ageing population \u2013 the government is worried about the cost of a western European-style welfare state. Rudimentary healthcare and the cost of a decent education means that families save far more heavily than in the west, leaving them with less money left over at the end of the month to spend in the shops. Unless that changes, the imbalances in the global economy that were at the root of the crisis will remain a threat. In the longer term, Beijing has to decide how to use China&apos;s growing economic clout on the global stage. China has allowed Americans to live beyond their means for years by using its export earnings to buy US Treasury bonds; the fear in Washington is that Beijing will pull the plug once it is ready to challenge US hegemony. According to Tylecote, China&apos;s geopolitical objectives are far more limited. &quot;Taiwan is clearly a massive issue and China does not want to be told it cannot reclaim the motherland because an American fleet is sitting in the Taiwan Strait. It wants to challenge US hegemony in its own sea lanes. But I don&apos;t think policy makers have a 30-40 year time horizon; they are much more focused on short-term issues.&quot; One of these issues \u2013 which runs through decision making in the short, medium and long term \u2013 is how to make China&apos;s growth environmentally sustainable. Jeffrey Sachs, the US economist, believes that by 2050 China and America will have economies of a similar size, yet if China operated at the same level of resource use and energy intensity as the US it would require four planets to support its 1.5 billion people. &quot;Pollution is a really serious issue,&quot; said Williamson. &quot;But it is only partially being addressed. The government is looking at nuclear power, solar power, and renewables in an attempt to improve efficiency but in some cities there is a dash for growth and the environment is low on the priority list.&quot; China&apos;s stance at December&apos;s climate change summit in Copenhagen is seen as crucial in piecing together a successor to the 1997 Kyoto agreement. Western diplomats say they detect a softening in Beijing&apos;s approach, but China will not be pushed around. Its growth rate means it will get the one thing its policymakers want more than anything else: respect."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/20/taiwan-solar-stadium", "publicationDate": "2009-05-20T12:11:58Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Solar power", "Renewable energy", "Energy", "Taiwan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Taiwan recently finished construction on an incredible solar-powered stadium that will generate 100% of its electricity from photovoltaic technology!", "On days where the stadium is not being used, the Taiwanese government plans to feed the extra energy into the local grid, where it will meet almost 80% of the neighboring area&apos;s energy requirements."], "title": "Guardian Environment Network: Taiwan's solar stadium 100% powered by the sun", "article": "Taiwan recently finished construction on an incredible solar-powered stadium that will generate 100% of its electricity from photovoltaic technology!

The project will officially open later this year to welcome the 2009 World Games. Building a new stadium is always a massive undertaking that requires millions of dollars, substantial physical labor, and a vast amount of electricity to keep it operating. Toyo Ito&apos;s design negates this energy drain with a stunning 14,155 sq meter solar roof that is able to provide enough energy to power the stadium&apos;s 3,300 lights and two jumbo vision screens. To illustrate the incredible power of this system, officials ran a test this January and found that it took just six minutes to power up the stadium&apos;s entire lighting system! The stadium also integrates additional green features such as permeable paving and the extensive use of reusable, domestically made materials. Built upon a clear area of approximately 19 hectares, nearly 7 hectares has been reserved for the development of integrated public green spaces, bike paths, sports parks, and an ecological pond. Additionally, all of the plants occupying the area before construction were transplanted. Non-sports fans in the community have a lot to jump up and down for as well. Not only does the solar system provide electricity during the games, but the surplus energy will also be sold during the non-game period. On days where the stadium is not being used, the Taiwanese government plans to feed the extra energy into the local grid, where it will meet almost 80% of the neighboring area&apos;s energy requirements. Overall, the stadium will generate 1.14 million KWh per year, preventing the release of 660 tons of carbon dioxide into atmosphere annually. \u2022 This article was shared by our content partner Inhabitat, part of the Guardian Environment Network"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/20/obituary-henry-hsu", "publicationDate": "2009-05-20T22:41:02Z", "tags": ["China", "Japan", "Second world war", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["An athlete before the second world war, he later became a leading businessman and politician in Taiwan, and a\u00a0member of the International Olympic Committee from 1970 to 1988.", "After the war he became a successful businessman in Hong Kong, and later moved to Taiwan where he served as an MP and presidential adviser.", "He owned a string of hotels in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US."], "title": "Obituary: Henry Hsu", "article": "One of the great novels of Chinese literature tells of the exploits of a\u00a0group of Song dynasty outlaws known as the 108 Lo-Hon, or heroes. Many centuries later, on Christmas Day 1941, as Hong Kong surrendered after a bitter 18-day battle, another band of fighters broke through the Japanese lines and marched for four days across the bandit-infested hills of occupied China to freedom. This gang numbered just 68 and was mostly British. But the two Chinese men who led it were so impressed by its swashbuckling spirit that they declared: &quot;Our number has grown to 108.&quot; Henry Hsu, who has died aged 96, was one of those leaders. An athlete before the second world war, he later became a leading businessman and politician in Taiwan, and a\u00a0member of the International Olympic Committee from 1970 to 1988. Shortly before his death, he was approached by a group of the escapers&apos; descendants who are planning to re-enact the journey. He agreed to be their &quot;commander-in-chief&quot;, hoping to be able to wave them off from Hong Kong next Christmas. As a young officer in the Chinese navy, Hsu was to play a crucial role in the success of the escape. When the Japanese invaded Hong Kong, hours after Pearl Harbor, Hsu was based in the city as the aide-de-camp of Admiral Chan Chak, a one-legged ex-warlord and southern president of the Kuomintang (Nationalist party of China). The pair were soon in the thick of the action, helping to eliminate Chinese fifth columnists and liaising with British intelligence to combat Japanese efforts to buy off the local triads. When the colony finally fell, Britain felt honour-bound to help Chan and Hsu escape and duly promised them places on the last motor torpedo boat leaving Hong Kong. So began a sequence straight out of a Boy&apos;s Own annual. As Japanese troops poured into the city centre, Hsu bundled the admiral into the front seat of his car with assorted British officers in the back and drove off at high speed for the fishing village of Aberdeen. The promised boat gone, they borrowed an abandoned launch, coming under fierce fire as they left the harbour. With their boat shot up and at least two dead, the group took to the water. As the admiral removed his wooden leg (in\u00a0which he had stashed HK$200,000), a bullet entered his wrist. He was pulled to a\u00a0small island by Hsu, who left his boss bleeding behind a rock and scampered off to find a small flotilla of motor torpedo boats waiting in the bay behind. The group sailed through the night to Mirs Bay and the coast of the mainland. There, Hsu contacted local guerrillas to help fend off Japanese patrols. He then plotted the route that the group would take and, during the 80-mile trek into free China, arranged food in villages and lodging on temple floors. The leadership skills and determination that marked his later careers shine through in the many diaries that survive of the escape. Heng Hsu - known as Henry - was born in Guangdong province, in southern China, and went to Whampoa military academy before studying law in Shanghai. A versatile athlete, he competed in the 10th Far East games, in Manila in 1934, winning medals in football and volleyball. After the war he became a successful businessman in Hong Kong, and later moved to Taiwan where he served as an MP and presidential adviser. He owned a string of hotels in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the US. Hsu was appointed OBE in 1942. He is survived by his son and two daughters. His wife, Amy, predeceased him.

Chen Yee Lin stands attentive, notepad in hand. Xiao Pei Wen closes her eyes and hums a note, barely louder than a whisper. When he is sure that he has heard its exact pitch and quiver, Chen Yee Lin lets out a flat, toneless bark of &quot;MmmmaaAAAA.&quot; Then she hums again. The next note is louder; it is met with the same response from Chen Yee Lin. The next hum is louder still, shorter this time, until they create together a fast crescendo of singing and barking. After a minute or so (sometimes less), she opens her eyes, smiles, glances over his notes, always nods (she never makes a comment or suggestion) and moves on to the next exhibit. The notes will be translated back into sound by Chen Yee Lin, during long hours in a recording studio at the next location. Sometimes tourists take photos of her in action. She sighs each time, wishes she could escape her fame, but in fact they just find her amusing, and none of them know who she is."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/21/china-identity-foreign-relations", "publicationDate": "2009-05-21T21:00:03Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Relations with Taiwan are at their best for decades, as Beijing engages with a more mainland-friendly president."], "title": "David or Goliath? China's battle to win the war of perception", "article": "     Xu Shunjian is a diplomat. Not the official, suave and suited, our-man-in-Kampala kind. But for three years he has been doing his bit to change perceptions of China. He had never left Fujian province before he flew 6,000 miles to Uganda, where his team is turning a remote, dusty, rutted track into a smooth road winding 76 miles (122km) across the country. &quot;Before we came here, the locals had only seen Chinese people in movies. So they believed every Chinese man could do kung fu and was tough,&quot; the slim, bespectacled graduate said with a chuckle. &quot;I thought African people were wild. Now that I&apos;ve come here, I see they are much more friendly.&quot; Three decades ago, Xu and his compatriots had little opportunity to leave their country nor meet the few foreigners who visited. Now China is wide open to the world. But while its growing reach has forged new alliances and better understanding, it is also creating new tensions. From its recent naval confrontation with the US in the South China Sea, to its anger at western pressure over Tibet, Beijing appears ever more confident as its reach extends around the globe \u2013 and its rivals appear more watchful. For years, foreign policy was guided by Deng Xiaoping&apos;s cautious injunction, Tao guang yang hui (&quot;hide brightness, cherish obscurity&quot;) \u2013 or, in the official translation, &quot;nourish capabilities and bide our time&quot;. But there is nothing obscure about China these days; it seems that its time has arrived. Just scan the recent headlines: Chinese workers strike in Romania; Chinese property hunters seek bargains in New York; Chinese peacekeepers patrol Darfur and Kosovo; the Chinese navy battle Somalian pirates. The premier, Wen Jiabao, publicly frets about the safety of its vast US treasury holdings, and President Hu Jintao took centre stage at the G20 meeting in London. Analysts begin to talk of the &quot;G2&quot;; Americans of &quot;our most important bilateral relationship&quot;. Vice-president and heir apparent, Xi Jinping, struck a very different note to Deng on an overseas trip this spring. &quot;There are some well-fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than point fingers at our affairs,&quot; he complained, in brusque remarks unreported by the state media but quickly noted on Chinese blogs and by foreign diplomats. &quot;China does not, first, export revolution; second, export poverty and hunger; third, cause troubles for you. What else is there to say?&quot; Western media bias Xi&apos;s aggrieved tone might confuse the west, but it resonates with his public. This year&apos;s publishing sensation is China is Unhappy, a collection of angry essays railing at foreign bullies and domestic fascination with western ways. Grievances range from protests during the Olympic torch relay to high-consuming nations&apos; calls for China to cut pollution; one author suggests China might have to break with the west one day. Despite sniffy, sometimes despairing reviews from liberals, it topped the bestseller lists. Its lengthy list of gripes includes western media bias, but its \u00adpublicity-savvy authors are happy to take their chances; they chose to meet the Guardian in a Starbucks in central Beijing. Between sips of his cappuccino, co-author Wang Xiaodong explained why China should engage in the arms race; he deems this year&apos;s 14.9% rise in military spending insufficient. A slight man in his fifties, he has the air of a schoolmaster but a shock-jock&apos;s sense of mischief and flair for incendiary statements. &quot;China must have the power to wipe America from the earth. It&apos;s the only way to deter them,&quot; he said cheerfully. &quot;China is really willing to co-operate with the west, but is still refused by western nations. &quot;We have felt very comfortable over the years of free trade, because we have kept winning. But also, the west keeps losing. So we worry that at some point the west will use military or political power to fight China. The other thing is that, for a long time, China has needed more resources \u2026 That must create conflicts.&quot; Though many Chinese dispute his conclusions, few disagree with his basic premise. &quot;People outside see China as much more powerful than China perceives itself to be. Our challenges and troubles have expanded as well as our interests,&quot; explained Professor Shi Yinhong, a highly respected foreign policy expert at Renmin university. He dismisses the idea of a bipolar world; China&apos;s current status is perhaps &quot;a regional power, plus&quot;. Historic humiliations To outsiders, China is a giant: a huge, populous, monolithic state, with rapidly rising military spending, vast coffers for foreign investment and an increasing keenness to impose its views. But where they see Goliath, China sees David: an over-populated, under-resourced developing country still recovering from historic humiliations at the hands of foreign powers \u2013 including the British \u2013 and still pushed around by the west. &quot;There&apos;s concern [among leaders] that if China&apos;s growing power becomes too conspicuous, other countries will view it as a threat, gang up on it and try to contain it,&quot; said Professor Susan Shirk, author of China: Fragile Superpower and a former US deputy assistant secretary of state. &quot;They have worked very hard to show they want to be more co-operative and that as they become more powerful they&apos;re not a threat. They&apos;re willing to compromise, negotiate; they&apos;re dealmakers.&quot; China is willing to show its strength; last winter it postponed an entire EU summit because Nicolas Sarkozy had met the Dalai Lama. But it also wants the world to like it. Relations with Taiwan are at their best for decades, as Beijing engages with a more mainland-friendly president. It&apos;s pouring billions into &quot;soft power&quot; projects, setting up Confucius Institutes and expanding its foreign-language media. Yet a recent poll for the BBC World Service found that while 92% of the Chinese surveyed believed China&apos;s global influence was mainly positive, only 39% of respondents in other nations agreed \u2013 a 6 point drop on the previous year. It was the largest perception gap in any of the 21 countries. &quot;The public hold a strong hatred against the Chinese,&quot; declared Wang. &quot;Sometimes people in government are actually more friendly \u2013 they are more practical. But American people have a stronger hatred against Chinese people aroused by the media. It&apos;s the same in Germany, France and Britain,&quot; he insisted. Mutual suspicions erupted with last spring&apos;s fatal riots in Lhasa and the subsequent explosion of wrath from nationalists. They accused the western media, and wider public, of indifference to Chinese deaths, an exaggeration of Tibetan sufferings and deliberate distortions of the truth. China&apos;s fenqing (&quot;angry youth&quot;) roared into action, bombarding journalists with death threats. When a Tibetan activist tried to wrench the Olympic torch from a Paralympian during the Paris leg of the relay, passions went into overdrive. Thousands of flag-waving activists besieged Carrefour&apos;s Chinese stores; in Hunan, an American shopper fled as a crowd yelled &quot;Kill the Frenchman&quot;. Simmering rage Years of &quot;patriotic education&quot; and media manipulation have helped to create this simmering rage. But nationalism is a longstanding force which China&apos;s leaders fear as well as foster. It bolsters support for an unelected government. It can also push them towards foreign policy positions they suspect are unwise and it has a history of toppling regimes which fail to meet patriotic expectations. The Carrefour protests were squashed before they could spread. Wang is well-versed in western thinking, from classical philosophers to Jared Diamond and Francis Fukuyama. He has travelled abroad and reads and watches western media. But he says there is no paradox in the fact that increasing western influence is accompanied, in many cases, by increasing hostility. He sees it as a natural reaction to the idealisation of the west. &quot;When Chinese people go outside they realise the outside world is not as good as it was described and China is not as bad. That&apos;s why the more Chinese people travel, the more nationalistic they become. &quot;Our book is focused on these points because many Chinese think westerners are angels. [But] to be honest, I don&apos;t think there should be such huge resentment. We&apos;re business partners,&quot; he said. Cheap Chinese labour has undercut western manufacturers, but also kept inflation down. Meanwhile, western shoppers have kept Chinese citizens in work. China has taken vast amounts of mineral wealth from Africa; but it has also provided infrastructure. China and other nations will continue to clash on many fronts \u2013 from human rights to resources. But China&apos;s citizens are looking to a multipolar world, not to global supremacy. When a recent internet survey asked whether China had the power to lead the world, 54.4% agreed it &quot;should seize the best opportunity created by the financial crisis&quot;. Another 41.3% reached very different conclusions, judging that &quot;this radical nationalism must be brought under control&quot;. Thousands of miles away from home, Xu Shunjian is digging into rice and stir-fried vegetables with his chopsticks, as Chinese state television blares in the background. He came to Africa only to make money, and he misses his motherland. But after supper he shows off photographs of dinner at a Ugandan colleague&apos;s home: &quot;I learned to use fingers to take food like that \u2026 you see!&quot; he exclaimed happily. &quot;I want to learn things from different countries and learn about their differences,&quot; he said. &quot;Of course, when you go to another country, your patriotic feelings will rise. But I&apos;ve also become more open-minded.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/may/21/archipelago-wind-farm-goats-deaths", "publicationDate": "2009-05-21T21:14:12Z", "tags": ["Wind power", "Environment", "Animal behaviour", "Science", "Animals", "World news"], "sentences": ["Officials investigating the unexplained deaths of scores of the animals on the windy island chain in the Taiwan strait believe that the introduction of noisy wind turbines could have given the unfortunate goats a fatal case of exhaustion."], "title": "'Turbines wind up my goats'", "article": "After three years of intrigue and confusion, not to mention a death toll of 400, the great Penghu archipelago goat mystery may finally have been solved.

He said that the agricultural authorities would do more tests to rule out any other causes of death, adding that if the giant power-generating turbines proved to be at fault, Taipower might help the farmer with moving costs.

But the world&apos;s economic woes cast long shadows down those same sunny streets, with jobless figures rising sharply and industries in peril. The US media are going through particular hell at the moment. Advertising is disappearing, newspapers are closing and thousands are losing their jobs. To hold an international media conference against this backdrop was going to be a challenge, but the Organization of News Ombudsmen was determined that its annual soul-search was to be a positive one, because, in spite of the heartache in the west, media in the rest of the world are quietly embracing this unique form of self-regulation. Ombudsmen from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Estonia, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Turkey and the US gathered to share their experiences and hear that newspapers and broadcasters in Taiwan, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Lebanon and the Pacific Islands want to employ ombudsmen in their newsrooms and want ONO to help. I have spent the past 10 months urging funding bodies to support ONO&apos;s aim to appoint an executive director who can co-ordinate these and other projects. I&apos;m pleased to report that the Open Society Institute has given $56,100 towards these aims and that the conference voted to appoint Jeffrey Dvorkin as executive director. Dvorkin is a highly experienced journalist and former ombudsman who will bring much-needed evangelistic zeal to the post. But we are not stopping there. The media are changing faster today than at any time since the invention of the printing press, and readers&apos; editors, public editors, readers&apos; advocates, call them what you will, have to adapt, too. We have to devise ways to make our ethical standards work within the blogosphere and we have to consider allowing online media critics into the fold. That will be a tough one, as there is plenty of suspicion on both sides, but ONO can&apos;t sit on its hands; it has a wealth of experience that should be shared as widely as possible. Our conference was held at the Washington Post, National Public Radio and the Washington bureau of the New York Times, institutions that believe in having an advocate for the audience within the newsroom, unlike the 14 US newspapers that have dissolved their ombudsmen&apos;s posts in the past year. Even Rupert Murdoch, not noted for his warmth towards the idea of ombudsmanship, was talking recently about &quot;a newspaper&apos;s most precious asset: the bond with its readers&quot;.

Beyond are the skyscrapers of downtown Manila and the chaos of the streets - the calls of hawkers and warbling Pinoy radio music mingling with the snarling engines of Jeepney taxis stalled in traffic and the shrill whistles of traffic police, trying to rein in the uncontrollable energy of one of the world&apos;s most frenetic cities.  We are perched on the stilted home of Maritess Ruga, which looks out over the vastness of the Tondo slum - a floating city of rusted roofs. As the teenager is gutting a rotting pile of tilapia, blood runs down her wrists and elbows. Inside the two-room hovel, her three younger siblings and an elderly aunt are gathered around the small television set, silently engrossed in one of Manila&apos;s favourite soap opera&apos;s, Dahil sa Iyong Paglisan (Because You Left), a ham-fisted tele-novella based on the hardships endured by the Philippines&apos; eight million or so foreign workers. On the wall above the crackling TV is an oversized photograph of the children&apos;s mother. Shrine-like, the photocopied image is surrounded by rosary beads, candles and plastic flowers. &quot;She works as a maid in Dubai, like all our mothers,&quot; says Maritess. At 15 she has had to take on the role of family matriarch. Her father is sleeping, as usual, on the mat he shares on the narrow balcony with two stray dogs.  Like most of the slum&apos;s eldest daughters, Maritess has been up since dawn preparing the home and will go to bed only after her day&apos;s chores are finished. It&apos;s been this way since she was nine. In Tondo, a local schoolteacher told me a few days later, the schools don&apos;t have parents&apos; nights - the children are brought up by their older siblings. In most families, one or both parents are working abroad. &quot;This is the Philippines in 2009,&quot; the teacher tells me. &quot;Slum girls like Maritess face two tough choices for their future: to provide for their family they can go into prostitution, or they can go abroad, like their mothers.&quot;  Today, the slum mothers of Manila Metro are permanently elsewhere, maids and nannies to the world, with about one in seven Filipino workers abroad at any given time. It&apos;s a worldwide phenomenon. About 300m economic migrants from India, sub-Saharan Africa, South and Central America and southeast Asia are scattered across the globe, supporting a population back home that is closer to a billion. Were these international foreign workers to constitute a state, a migration nation if you like, it would rank as the world&apos;s third largest. They are an economic powerhouse. Migrants from the developing world sent home an estimated $300bn last year.  Consider the figure. It&apos;s nearly three times the world&apos;s foreign-aid budgets combined. These sums, or &quot;remittances&quot; as they are known, bring Morocco more money than tourism, Sri Lanka more money than tea and, in the Philippines, this foreign legion of workers is so essential to the government that the economy would collapse without them. More than half the world&apos;s migrants are women, many caring for children abroad while leaving their own at home.  More than any other country, though, the Philippines has become synonymous with migrant labour. In Greece, for example, the modern Greek word for a maid is a &quot;Filipineza&quot;. The most recent figures show that there are 1.2m Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) registered in Saudi Arabia, closely followed by Japan, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. And with workers in at least 170 other countries, OFWs are everywhere, including the high seas. About a quarter of the world&apos;s seafarers come from the Philippines. But behind the hard-earned dollars sent home, there are many tales of abject exploitation and sorrow, sexual abuse, violence and even murder.  A tattered billboard welcomes drivers on the dusty highway that winds its way towards the down-at-heel town of Alaminos, 170km north of Manila: &quot;May God Praise Our Seafarers and Overseas Foreign Workers&quot;. Underneath the sign is the sponsor of the tribute, the town&apos;s largest shopping mall, which has sprung up largely on the back of OFW remittances. Just short of her 22nd birthday, Jennifer Perez would have passed the same sign as she left her village home in the northern Luzon province of the Philippines in the summer of 2006.  Like most migrant domestic workers heading for the Middle East, she packed a roll-on bag, stuffed with loose clothing, befitting Jordan, the Muslim country that would become her new home. Fatefully, she also packed her aunt&apos;s mobile phone to allow her to text her parents. Clutched in her left hand was the rosary her mother had given her before departure. She was proud of the carefully laminated documents in her luggage: certificates for 12 hours of on-the-job-training in elderly care, first aid, CPR and hospitality services, and the driver&apos;s licence she would never get to use.  A college graduate with a degree in physical education and dance, Jennifer had signed up to work for two years in the Jordanian city of Irbid, a dusty, nondescript settlement an hour north of Amman. A few days later, barely 24 hours after arriving in Jordan, Jennifer fell asleep in her small room in her employers&apos; house. She was woken by her female employer (a dentist whose husband was a member of the prominent Obeidat tribe), who stormed into the room with the mobile phone that had been hidden in Jennifer&apos;s luggage, and threatened to confiscate it. Like most foreign domestics, Jennifer was banned from having contact with the outside world.  A fight broke out between the two women and, moments later, Jennifer fell four storeys from the kitchen veranda, landing squarely on her back. As the young woman lay in a coma in a Jordanian hospital, her employer claimed it was a suicide attempt. Jennifer&apos;s family say their daughter, like hundreds of Filipina workers in the Middle East over the past two decades, was simply thrown off the balcony. The woman was arrested and charged with assault as Jennifer, by now a quadriplegic, fought a losing battle to stay alive. Her employer was released after posting an undisclosed bail.  Speaking two years later from Alaminos, Jennifer&apos;s father, Herminiio, himself a former OFW in Saudi Arabia, claims his daughter&apos;s death - and those of hundreds of domestic workers abroad - is a tragedy of globalisation.  &quot;It is easier for these girls to go abroad than ever, with agents now paying their airfares and then taking half their salaries,&quot; Herminiio says. &quot;My daughter was a slave. She was treated like an animal, a nothing. Every day we read in the newspapers about families who have gone through similar hell: young girls raped, abused, beaten, murdered. A transaction seems to take place when a Filipina domestic helper goes abroad. When she steps over the threshold of her employers&apos; home she gives up her human rights and her freedom. My message to these girls is the money is not important. Poverty is terrible, but it allows its own freedoms from violence and abuse.&quot;  What made his daughter&apos;s story harder to take was the fact that it took so long for her to die - nine months in total. &quot;We had to fight to get her home,&quot; says Herminiio. &quot;We were crippled with medical expenses and had to hold a television appeal to raise funds for her flight. She came home a quadriplegic and died of a broken heart, despite being surrounded by the people she loves and who loved her. Every time a domestic helper returns to the Philippines dead, why is she always ruled to have killed herself? Why are so many of our girls killing themselves, jumping out of windows, off roofs and balconies; are they all insane?&quot;  Migrants have been leaving the Philippines in search of work for decades. The key difference now, however, is where they migrate to. Mired in red tape and post-9/11 paranoia, the US is no longer an attainable promised land. That role has been taken on by the Middle East. The big Arab oil states have small populations but, until recently, grand development ambitions. Only through foreign labour can their lofty aims be achieved, which is why more than 14m migrants, many of them Filipino, are active in the Arabian peninsula alone. The winter rain is whipping off the Mediterranean sea and pounding the stained glass windows of the 17th-century crypt in the heart of Old Beirut. Inside, the narrow pews are packed with browbeaten women: a league of nations in their Sunday best - maids from India, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Philippines. Below, in the catacombs, there is only silence. There, the women who have chosen not to be part of the morning congregation sit and contemplate their lives. In the darkness of the church, they seek sanctuary from their lives as slaves. In the past two years alone, more than 100 maids have died in Beirut in sinister circumstances, victims of abuse by cruel masters and mistresses. Countless more have been beaten, raped and even tortured. The walls of the basement are plastered with &quot;Missing&quot; posters of maids who have fled abusive owners, their whereabouts now unknown.  One unnamed Ethiopian maid, in a government hospital after &quot;falling&quot; from a 12th-floor balcony, says her Lebanese employer pushed her off. The police, as is normally the case, dispute her claim and are hoping to deport her as soon as possible. The 25-year-old&apos;s testimony, which has been made public, is chilling: &quot;Madam asked me to hang the clothes. Then she came and pushed me from behind.&quot; Too frightened to let her name be published, she said her employer had frequently threatened and abused her. &quot;Madam would tell me, &apos;I will spill hot oil on you.&apos; She would take a knife and threaten to kill me. She would beat me with shoes, pull my hair to the floor.&quot;  Her testimony, along with thousands of others&apos;, has been gathered by Human Rights Watch (HRW). The group claims that, every week, one of an estimated 200,000 migrant domestic workers in Lebanon dies. Normally it is recorded as &quot;suicide&quot; or falling while trying to escape their employer. Another major cause of death is untreated illness - hospitals cost money and maids aren&apos;t seen as worth the expense. HRW claims that maids in Lebanon, as elsewhere in the Middle East, are increasingly vulnerable to beatings, rape and murder - and there are no laws to protect them from abusive employers. Indrani Ekanayaka is a 27-year-old Sri Lankan who has lived for the past year in the basement of a Beirut shelter run by the Christian charity group Caritas, after fleeing an abusive employer. She says there are thousands of women like her still suffering in silence. &quot;I was paid for the first year and a half, but then I wasn&apos;t paid for the next eight years. When I asked for money, Madam would swear at me and break glasses against the wall. I was only given some bread and rice to eat. Fruit was forbidden. I was not allowed to speak to my parents. They thought I had died,&quot; she says, the tears welling up. &quot;I managed to escape. I got a copy of the key they used to lock my door at night and I crept out. I&apos;m certain if they&apos;d caught me they&apos;d have killed me. I filed a police report, but they only told me I would be deported. Now, they have a new maid, a Filipina. They are abusing someone else. I came to Beirut from Lebanon because I had the chance to help build a home for my parents and sisters, but my life is a nightmare.&quot;  Indrani, who has four sisters at home and a family torn apart by the country&apos;s civil war, believes she has let her family down. &quot;My family expected great things of me, that I would have enough money for a house and a good life, but all I have had is torture and misery and I am left with nothing to show for it. I am penniless. I think I will go back next year and then I will probably have no option but to try another country. I know there is no work for me at home and that&apos;s why there are so many young Sri Lankan women all over the world, suffering like me, to send money home.&quot;  The majority of abused domestic workers in Beirut, however, are Filipina. One is Mila, 27. &quot;I left Manila for Beirut at 22,&quot; she says, &quot;because it was an easy choice to make. Stay and watch my family starve or leave and help to feed and clothe them. My parents were getting elderly and it was me and my sister&apos;s jobs to make sure they were secure. I approached an agent in Manila who told me a job in Beirut as a domestic maid, a cleaner, a cook and a babysitter rolled into one would make 10 times as much as I could make in Manila. I accepted on the spot and my parents spent their last few pesos for admission to the airport lounge from where I left. And then I suppose they went home to cry and wait for the money. I wasn&apos;t paid for a year and my sister was also struggling abroad, so they had to rely on loan sharks.&quot;  When Mila arrived in Beirut she was imprisoned in the basement of a home with only iron bars for a window. &quot;It was damp and it felt like a torture chamber. At times my madam, who told me she was my &apos;owner&apos;, made me do everything. I had to cut her toenails, scrub her feet, wash her clothes, cook and clean. I had to look after her nephews, light her cigarettes. My life was a living hell. Her partner would try and molest me and threatened to tell the mistress I was a prostitute if I didn&apos;t comply. I only managed to escape in the end because I got a letter out to a lawyer who turned up at the door and then the mistress simply threw me out on the street. I&apos;m still fighting to get my salary from her. She owes me a year and a half&apos;s wages, about $5,000.&quot;  Nigerian Agnus Iyo Emeka, 27, is another maid at the Beirut refuge. She came to Lebanon to be a domestic worker, suffered beatings and torture at the hands of her employer and was sexually assaulted by her employer&apos;s husband. &quot;Many women who come to the centre talk about how they are treated as sex objects by the Arab men,&quot; she says. &quot;It starts off with simple groping, but in most cases ends up in full rape. I was assaulted by my owner&apos;s husband. I also had a friend who was raped; she lived in the same apartment block and the man of the house raped her every day for months, until she jumped from a third-floor window and broke her pelvis. So many young women have died in Beirut. I have personally known two who have died - I knew them from church. Praying one day and dead the next.&quot;  Another victim of abuse in the Beirut refuge is Ayalnesh Alameraw, a 26-year-old from Ethiopia. &quot;I came from Addis Ababa five years ago. An agent approached my parents and offered to take three of their daughters to &apos;Europe&apos;, but they only took me. My sisters were spared. I thought I was going to London. I had never heard of Beirut until I boarded the plane.&quot; Ayalnesh was taken to the agency offices and given her uniform, a pink domestic outfit, but no training. &quot;My first madam was the cruellest woman I have ever met,&quot; she says. &quot;I was beaten for staining clothes and fined six months&apos; wages for &apos;damage&apos;. I was beaten with shoes, belts and even a thin iron bar. I tried to escape five times and each time I was taken back to her by the police. They always caught me and ordered me to return or I would be put in prison. They never listened to any of my stories. They didn&apos;t waste a single drop of ink on me until I jumped from a fourth-floor window. Looking over a balcony and being so desperate to escape that you will risk your life is impossible to explain to someone who has never been imprisoned. You may think being imprisoned in a tiny apartment isn&apos;t really a prison, but in a city where you have no voice and no rights and nobody hears your screams or cries for help you are in a hell.&quot;  When Ayalnesh recovered from her fall she was sent to a detention centre to await deportation. &quot;My madam filed a complaint with the agency and accused me of stealing. I was inside the centre during the 2006 bombing campaign by the Israelis and we thought we would be buried alive in the rubble.&quot; The sick went untreated, and almost everyone, eventually, in the stifling summer heat, became ill. &quot;As the war continued we became a hindrance and six of us were taken to Caritas, who still look after me now. I can&apos;t go back to Addis. I have a family of seven brothers and sisters and my parents are simple cattle raisers. I have more chance of being a success abroad.&quot; Ayalnesh, like many foreign workers, believes her best chance of being treated fairly is now in London, a growing market for domestic workers.  A ragged flock of starlings flies across the roof of the Kalayaan drop-in centre in Holland Park, west London. It&apos;s a hard building to find. The narrow entrance blends into the concrete facade rendering it almost as invisible as the women the unit was created for. Only thin writing scratched on the buzzer identifies your location. In the adjacent courtyard, wealthy Londoners sit in the garden of a wine bar. Laughter fills the air. Above them, in a cramped office, domestic workers sit crouched over plates of noodles speaking to each other frantically in broken English. &quot;The foreign girl next door to you in London never rests,&quot; says Gita, a maid from northern India. &quot;She works day and night and is never allowed to leave the apartment. She sleeps in the kitchen with the dog. She does the dirty work. She wipes the bottoms of the young and the old, she gives baths, she washes clothes. She barely eats. That is my story, this is my life even now.&quot; And according to Gita, this is the story all over London. &quot;It is happening next door to many of you,&quot; she says, &quot;but you just don&apos;t realise it. The girl escapes, but her owner finds her in the street and takes her back. I was held prisoner for two years and I wasn&apos;t paid a penny for my last year&apos;s work. This is the dream your country has to offer.&quot;  Around Gita, the other women softly clap their hands in timid solidarity. Few have the confidence to raise their own voices. Britain, and London in particular, is one of the fastest growing markets in the world for recruiting foreign domestic workers. Many of these workers are migrants, serving &quot;cash-rich, time-poor&quot; British families as cleaners, nannies and cooks. Behind closed doors many are exploited and abused. Kalayaan, a campaigning group for migrant domestics, recently conducted a survey which showed that 86% of migrant maids work more than 16 hours a day, 71% have been deprived of food, 32% have had their passports withheld by their employers and 23% have been physically abused. Many of the women who visit the Kalayaan shelter sleep in hallways or in converted cupboards in small London apartments. Gita, who now works for a new family, also claims, like many of the domestic staff, to have been sexually abused. &quot;I worked for an Indian family in Hampstead. There were bars on the basement window where I slept. At first I only had a duvet cover to sleep on and then later a mattress on the floor. I was up at 5am to prepare roti for the madam and I worked until midnight each night. Sometimes I wasn&apos;t given any food and was pushed around by their eldest daughter. Although I shopped for the children&apos;s food, the wife never asked me to eat with them. I felt she would notice if I ate their food, so I borrowed money from a neighbour&apos;s maid to buy noodles and ate when I could.&quot; The family told Gita they were sending her money home, but they never did. &quot;The husband would come home and make advances on me. After a few months he started raping me. This went on for five months. Many of the maids in the UK are sexually abused, but are too frightened to report it for fear of deportation. Eventually I broke down in tears in front of his wife, but she didn&apos;t believe me, and later she was so furious she came at me with a hot iron. I realised she was going to burn my face. I put my arm up when she charged at me and she burnt that instead. Later that night she threw me on the street at 3am and I turned to Kalayaan.&quot; Proving what happened to Gita is impossible, she says.The family left Britain earlier this year.  Another London-based worker, Divia, reveals how she was forced to sleep on the stone floor of her madam&apos;s kitchen in the West End. She was fed so little her eyesight started to fail and she began to show symptoms of severe malnutrition. Her diet was entirely based on leftovers from the family table. &quot;I was so thin I would faint with hunger. But I have heard stories worse than mine in Kalayaan. When I hear of young girls who work for Arabs in London swallowing acid it makes me depressed. I know that could have been me. &quot;Sometimes I feel thankful that I had the strength not to try and take me own life. The women I met here are so filled with sadness, they are constantly on the verge of tears at the abuse they receive behind closed doors, but they have no voice and are too terrified of the authorities to trust them. They have seen other women deported for causing a fuss.&quot; According to Kalayaan, stories like Divia&apos;s are not uncommon. In the past few weeks a domestic worker in Knightsbridge, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, attempted suicide after years of abuse by her employer. The woman, a Filipina, swallowed acid and is now permanently disabled. Scotland Yard is investigating the case. Kalayaan spokeswoman Jenny Moss believes the situation is not improving. &quot;There is a saying here which is used by the Filipina workers: &apos;Kung walang hirap, walang ginhawa&apos;, which means &apos;Without suffering, there can be no ease,&apos;&quot; she says. &quot;Many of these women enter their working relationships here in Britain quite simply expecting to be treated badly. At Kalayaan we register about 350 new domestic workers each year, the majority of whom have been exploited or abused in the UK. Domestic workers are dependent on one employer for their work, their immigration status and their accommodation, and this makes them extremely vulnerable. They often feel they have little choice but to accept their working conditions - no matter how abusive.&quot; It is late in downtown Manila. A young prostitute, no older than 14, stands in a yellow mini-skirt in front of a paunchy Welshman who has, fingers clicking, called her out from a group of around 30 skinny girls. As he heaves himself off a tiny bar stool he flicks up her skirt at the front to inspect her and with a wave of his hand sends her back to the goldfish bowl they stand in. Outside on Burgos Street, one of the most notorious red-light strips in Asia, the dark skies finally open up, breaking the intolerable humidity. Within moments the hot rain runs down the heavily made-up faces of the lowly street girls, the youngest of all the prostitutes, pathetic and ghoulish in their thin clothes and tottering high heels. Sheltering under the awning of a snack bar, Cristiana puts her hands out for a cigarette and shivers.  &quot;The rain is bad for business,&quot; says the 15-year-old. As she speaks, she absentmindedly scrawls her number in the menu of the caf\u00e9 she is taking shelter in. The menu she is holding is scribbled over with messages: &quot;Hi! Hello! My name is Maria.&quot; &quot;I&apos;m Tina. Call for your heart&apos;s desire.&quot; Inside the caf\u00e9 western men bounce tiny Filipina girls on their thighs like babies, the youngsters&apos; infantile appearances exaggerated by their white ankle socks. The younger they look the more money they will make.  &quot;I want to go to Europe, to work abroad as a massage therapist or a nurse. I would be happier there,&quot; says Cristiana. &quot;I am working here to pay my way through my entrance exams to become a nurse. That is the dream we all share. To leave these islands for a better life.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/may/28/netbooks-sales", "publicationDate": "2009-05-27T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Netbooks", "Computing", "Technology", "Dell", "IBM", "Sony", "Windows", "Linux", "Apple", "Google"], "sentences": ["The booming netbook market has not been driven by US companies but by three suppliers from Taiwan: Asus, Acer, and MicroStar International (MSI).", "Linux&apos;s failure in the UK market has been striking because the three Taiwanese manufacturers were keen to support it, and both Asus and Acer launched their first netbooks with Linux only.", "Asus is announcing its new systems at the Computex trade show in Taiwan at the beginning of June."], "title": "Netbooks: Are netbooks losing their shine? Jack Schofield reports", "article": "Netbooks have been the PC market&apos;s bright spot over the past nine months, but sales have slipped recently, and they now face an uncertain future. They are losing some of their price advantage over notebooks, and soon will be challenged by a new type of ultra-slim notebook PC with a long battery life. Netbooks first appeared in 2007 and have been a big success. Sales have far outstripped the predictions of analysts such as Gartner - 14m units last year, against a forecast of 5.3m - and now make up 20% of the portable PC market. The Asus marketing specialist John Swatton points to &quot;tech novices&quot; adopting netbooks in the way they have adopted mobile phones and MP3 players, which he says &quot;will drive further growth in the netbook market. We are also seeing more and more users purchasing netbooks as a second, and more portable, device to provide connectivity when away from their primary laptop or PC.&quot; An affordable, everyday option  &quot;The netbook has changed the landscape for good,&quot; says Ian Fogg, an analyst with Forrester. &quot;The netbook category has overturned the idea that users should pay a big price premium for ultraportables.&quot; Ultraportable notebook PCs have been available from companies such as IBM and Sony, but they typically cost \u00a31,500 to \u00a32,500. Today&apos;s netbooks cost around \u00a3200-\u00a3300, which makes them affordable enough for everyday commuters. Women like them because they can fit inside a handbag. Kids like them because they can have their own machine, and they may get one from their school - Dell has just launched a rubberised Latitude 2100 in a variety of colours for the education market. The netbook has also changed PC retailing, as high-street stores now sell them with USB modems for portable internet use. The Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal says: &quot;Sales through the telecoms channels have opened up a new target market.&quot; The netbook has even changed the competitive landscape for PC manufacturers. The booming netbook market has not been driven by US companies but by three suppliers from Taiwan: Asus, Acer, and MicroStar International (MSI). On Gartner&apos;s figures for this year&apos;s first quarter Acer&apos;s sales grew by 26.7% in a declining market, and it is now shipping roughly as many PCs worldwide as Dell. Because of the success of the Acer Aspire One, the company expects to be the market leader by volume in Europe this year. However, the netbook market seems to have slowed. US-based DisplaySearch indicates that while first quarter netbook sales were up by 556% compared with the same quarter last year, they were down by 26% sequentially, compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Notebook sales declined 24% sequentially, so netbooks are no longer growing against the market trend. This may be partly to do with the increase in specifications that has pushed up netbook prices. The classic netbook was cheaper than a notebook because it had a 7-inch screen, a small Flash drive, an Intel Atom processor, and used Linux instead of Microsoft&apos;s Windows Vista. Today&apos;s netbooks have 10- or 12-inch screens, 160MB hard drives, and run Windows XP. It is still cheaper to make a netbook than a notebook, but the gap has narrowed. Linux&apos;s failure in the UK market has been striking because the three Taiwanese manufacturers were keen to support it, and both Asus and Acer launched their first netbooks with Linux only. But after Microsoft made a cheap version of the supposedly obsolete XP available for ultra-low-cost PCs, Windows took over. Acer&apos;s European boss, Massimo D&apos;Angelo, says Linux sales are &quot;very, very minimal&quot; - less than 5% - while Asus and MSI have also seen rapid declines. MSI&apos;s UK marketing manager, Richard Stewart, says: &quot;We offered Linux for the first six or nine months of the Wind, but, as time went on the gap [to Windows] increased to the point where it wasn&apos;t worthwhile to offer Linux any more.&quot; Consuming not creating This is not just the failure of Linux, it is the failure of the netbook idea. You were supposed not to need a big hard drive and a powerful processor running Windows because all your applications would be on the net, and you&apos;d access them via a browser. But it seems most people preferred the system they already knew. Atwal says that when consumers buy new phones they are usually prepared to learn a new user interface - &quot;but on a phone, you&apos;re more likely to be viewing rather than creating content. I think that&apos;s the dividing line. When you&apos;re creating content, you&apos;re going to go with Windows.&quot; The problem with consuming as against creating, he says, is that &quot;most PC vendors haven&apos;t been able to segment their product lines on that basis, which is why we&apos;re seeing bigger keyboards and screens on netbooks. Then the chance of netbooks taking more of your mainstream market becomes much more apparent ... &quot; And that could be bad news. Netbooks are cheaper, and have slimmer profit margins, so vendors would rather sell you a notebook. Asus and MSI, of course, had fewer notebook sales to lose. Netbooks and notebooks are going to get even closer this year, for two reasons. First, Intel and the PC vendors are launching a new PC platform code-named Montevino Plus, for CULV (Consumer Ultra Low Voltage) machines. Second, Microsoft is launching Windows 7, which has been optimised so that even the Ultimate version will run pretty well on a netbook. Acer looks like being first to market with the new platform in its Timeline series. MSI has also announced its first machine, the X340 X-Slim, which is like a MacBook Air, but lighter and much cheaper. Asus is announcing its new systems at the Computex trade show in Taiwan at the beginning of June. CULV machines will offer a similar sort of battery life to netbooks, perhaps 6-8 hours. They may also weigh about the same - MSI&apos;s X-340 is 1.3kg, in spite of having a 13.4-inch widescreen. But they will have the processing power required for content creation, rather than content consumption. Initially, CULV machines will be two or three times the price of netbooks, but PC vendors think they will sell. Acer&apos;s UK managing director, Bobby Watkins, says: &quot;Half my demand from the channels [retailers] for the back-to-school period is for Timeline. They believe the pull for it is going to be really, really strong.&quot; A question of category The result could be that netbooks blend into the bottom part of the notebook market, with screens up to 12 inches in size, rather than being a distinct category. The question is whether consumers will pay for what they appear to want - a light, slim notebook with a decent screen and long battery life - or whether they are buying netbooks mainly on price. Microsoft similarly expects the demand for Windows 7 to be strong, and it is encouraging vendors to pre-install the Home Premium version on all the machines aimed at consumers - both netbooks and notebooks. The netbook suppliers want a cheaper version to maintain their price differential. Microsoft has a Starter version that will do the job well on a netbook (where applications are run in the browser) but won&apos;t be much good for notebook use, because it will only run three applications at once. The danger is that PC vendors will turn to another free operating system instead: Google&apos;s Android version of Linux, as used in the G1 mobile phone. That could emerge as the big battle over the next year."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/28/tiananmen-china", "publicationDate": "2009-05-28T09:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Tiananmen Square protests 1989", "Protest", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["It is only presenting a reasonably pacific face on issues such as Taiwan, Japan and the other irritations to its ambitions about regional hegemony and control of under-sea energy resources, because it is not quite ready to use military means instead \u2013 though it is rapidly getting there."], "title": "China's race to supremacy | AC Grayling", "article": "This year, 4 June will be the 20th anniversary of the day the tanks rolled over the democracy camp in Beijing&apos;s Tiananmen Square. The regime in Zhong Nan Hai, the government complex on the lake near the Forbidden City, which ordered the violent suppression of the reform demonstration, is still in power \u2013 politburo faces and names change, but the regime does not \u2013 and the number of dissidents who are brave enough to put their own names and faces to opposing it are now very few. A few of those few \u2013 19 of them, to be exact \u2013 met in Beijing on 10 May to commemorate the event, choosing to do so early to dodge state vigilance. The commemoration took the form of a round table discussion of what happened on 4 June 1989, the significance and consequences of the reform demonstrations leading to it and the current prospects for democracy in China. The 19 consisted of lawyers, editors, public intellectuals and some of the activists jailed because of their participation in the 4 June event itself. One of those present was my friend and co-author Xu Youyu, alongside whom I once taught at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, and whom later I was able to bring to Oxford for a period of research, during which we together wrote a book entitled The Long March to the Fourth of June (under the joint pseudonym Li Xiao Jun) on the history of the Chinese Communist party. I mention Xu Youyu, now celebrated in reform circles in China both for his dissident stance and his memoir of being a Red Guard during the Cultural Revolution (an experience that converted him to the ideals of liberal democracy), in order to do what I can to protect him. International recognition is one way that the extraordinarily courageous reformists in China can be somewhat helped against the remorseless iron-fistedness of a regime apparently so insecure and guilty-minded that it has to silence people who criticise it by locking them up and maltreating them. Those of us who maintain connections with members of the democracy movement inside China have covert methods of ensuring that our contacts are still at large; we know when they have been arrested, something that makes it more difficult for the regime closeted in Zhong Nan Hai to &quot;disappear&quot; their annoyingly intelligent, brave and insistent opponents. Xu was recently awarded a prize in Prague for his courage as a reform campaigner; that kind of thing can prove to be a lifeline in the most literal sense. The campaigners of Tiananmen Square in 1989 were the vanguard for the liberation of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union later that same year. They were crushed by the Chinese regime and its tanks, and failed to free their own fellows, but they freed scores of millions elsewhere in the world from one-party dictatorship and the surveillance of secret policemen. They did it by their example. They made the Chinese regime the unwitting key to turning the prison-house locks of East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia and elsewhere, by making it impossible for all but Romania (and even there half-heartedly) to try the same trick of opposing political protest with tanks and automatic rifles. They created a permanent outside opposition to the Chinese regime that with the same implacability as the regime itself \u2013 but by argument, organisation, and moral strength instead of armed force and bullying \u2013 is set on winning the argument for the liberation of China. Churchill&apos;s famous remark about the Battle of Britain pilots, the few to whom so many owed so much, could now be applied to China&apos;s dissidents, the few to whom the many (the world&apos;s population) could come to owe a very great deal indeed, because the burgeoning economic, industrial and political influence of China in the world \u2013 it is the next great superpower \u2013 makes it absolutely imperative that the country should be a democratic one, signed up to the rule of law and the idea of human rights, rather than what it is now: an imperialist, irredentist, massively human-rights-violating totalitarian state that will use any means to get its way. It is only presenting a reasonably pacific face on issues such as Taiwan, Japan and the other irritations to its ambitions about regional hegemony and control of under-sea energy resources, because it is not quite ready to use military means instead \u2013 though it is rapidly getting there. I have been writing intermittently for years about the dangers of China&apos;s long-term foreign policy aims, premised as they are on its totalitarian domestic attitudes, feeling like a Cassandra the while. In those years China has come to support even more delinquent regimes such as Burma, Zimbabwe and Sudan in order to keep the international arena unsettled, and to insinuate itself into parts of the world where it sees future profit and either supplies of energy or security for its energy routes (thus the deep-water harbours it has built, with its own labourers, for its tankers in Pakistan and Burma). It rattles its sabre, soon to be ready to use in earnest, over the gas and oil under the South and East China Seas, claiming the Spratly islands far to the south of Hainan and the whole of the continental shelf almost to the shores of Japan in the east. In its headlong rush for industrialisation it has grossly poisoned its own air, soil, rivers and people, loading itself with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of environmental clean-up costs for the future \u2013 if ever it cares to undertake it. In that rush it kills dozens of its own workers every week \u2013 its coal mines, where the frantic 24-hour grab for energy supplies proceeds with total disregard for safety, are the most dangerous mines in the world. It is in a race with time: its population is rapidly ageing and not replacing itself, its crazy tradition of female infanticide and selective abortion of females means there is a superfluity of males so that girls are being kidnapped as brides. China&apos;s totalitarians want economic and military (it sees them as the same thing) superpower status before the age of its population and the poison of its environment jointly scupper the ambition. For then it can use that status to find other ways of solving those problems \u2013 ways not so friendly to a world in whose nest it will be the largest cuckoo ever seen. I hope I am wrong. I hope those very brave, very few people around the table in Beijing on 10 May, Xu Youyu among them, will bring it about that these prognostications are wrong; that they will keep alight the torch of democratic liberty lit in Tiananmen Square, and that its light will eventually banish the thick dark clouds that roll perpetually out of Zhong Nan Hai."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/may/31/obama-foreign-policy-us", "publicationDate": "2009-05-31T22:00:00Z", "tags": ["Barack Obama", "Egypt", "US news", "World news", "Hosni Mubarak", "Africa"], "sentences": ["The administration needs China to co-operate on North Korea \u2013 not to mention climate change and the economy \u2013 which is why Hillary Clinton told reporters in February that Tibet and Taiwan &quot;can&apos;t interfere&quot; with these other matters."], "title": "The Obama doctrine? Let's see what he says to Mubarak | Michael Tomasky", "article": "On Thursday Barack Obama is set to deliver a much-anticipated speech from Cairo in which he will reportedly discuss democracy and human rights. These two traits, of course, are in scant supply in his host country. Whether this is an irony that the president hopes to side-step or a condition he will address head-on is an interesting question. The answer will help us address the larger question of whether, four months along, there \u00adexists anything that we might call &quot;the Obama doctrine&quot; of foreign policy. There are three basic schools of \u00adforeign-policy thought in America.\u00ad \u00adNeoconservatism holds that \u2026 well, I suspect you&apos;re familiar with that one. Realism opposes neoconservatism&apos;s zeal\u00a0to remake the world through force and \u00adsuggests the US act chiefly on the basis of\u00a0national interest, not messianic or human\u00adi\u00adtarian urges (the coarsest expression of this view in recent history: George Bush Sr&apos;s secretary of state, James Baker, telling Congress as war raged in Bosnia that &quot;we don&apos;t have a dog in this fight&quot;). Third, there is liberal internationalism, a sort of realism with sugar on top. Liberal internationalism also privileges the national interest but defines it more\u00a0broadly than realism does. Here, national interest is advanced through international co-operation and by expansion of human rights. The liberal internationalist argument on Bosnia, for example, saw US interests as explicitly tied to\u00a0post-communist European freedom and stability \u2013 and wanted to encourage the Bosnian attempts to create a multi-\u00adethnic rather than pan-ethnic society. Realists would say the society they chose to have was their business alone. There are two smaller schools \u2013 left\u00adwing anti-imperialist and rightwing isolationist \u2013 that have traction here and there. But the above are the big three. So where does Obama fit? We can&apos;t say yet. But if you made me, I&apos;d say it&apos;s mostly realist, with a few shots of liberal internationalism and even a jigger or two of neoconservatism. In fairness to the new administration, it was handed a mountain of calamities that, the world being the messy place it is, had the gall to refuse to fit neatly into these three categories. In Afghanistan, he inherited a full-on war. In Iraq, he took on a problem that he hopes doesn&apos;t get worse. Iran, North Korea, Israel and the Palestinians; the world economic meltdown, global warming and pollution; nuclear proliferation \u2026 these are all problems Obama&apos;s predecessor either created or exacerbated, and they&apos;re all at crisis or near-crisis point. In such circumstances, insistence on one -ism would be not only unattainable but outright undesirable. The problems require different approaches. As to Afghanistan, like it or not, no US president can inherit a war and walk away from it \u2013 for a host of political and substantive reasons, that&apos;s ill-advised. Even the neocons have cheered Obama&apos;s approach there (which makes me a little twitchy, but neocons, like stopped clocks, can be right sometimes). In the current North Korea crisis, we&apos;re looking at old-school, textbook realism. The administration needs China to co-operate on North Korea \u2013 not to mention climate change and the economy \u2013 which is why Hillary Clinton told reporters in February that Tibet and Taiwan &quot;can&apos;t interfere&quot; with these other matters. Finally, and more hopefully, there are, to borrow from our current economic lexicon, green shoots of something more humanitarian and forward-looking. The opening to Cuba was long overdue and ought to be the first step of several. The overtures to Iran are, at very least, worth a shot, given how badly the previous belligerent posture failed. And the recent admonition to Binyamin Netanyahu about stopping all settlements puts on the table an issue that US administrations of both parties avoided for years. And so all this returns us to Thursday. The most interesting question, to me, is how he&apos;ll describe his vision of what America can do to promote democracy and liberty. Yes, these were neocon goals. But it&apos;s not the goals that were wrong, just the ends (military force). During the Bush years, some American liberals came to reject even these goals just because Bush endorsed them. So one of Obama&apos;s tasks on Thursday is to reclaim these goals, yank them out of their neoconservative context and place them in a liberal-internationalist one. That discourse will be directed toward Americans, and others living in countries where freedom is secure. But much of the speech has to be aimed at people \u2013 and leaders \u2013 in the developing world, where it is not. Obama&apos;s election inspired the world. Can he inspire now that he&apos;s president? Can he lay out principles and values that a complex and defiant and snappish world will hear, absorb and maybe even try to live by? Egypt is a ripe test case, and I wonder whether Obama will have the bad manners, but laudable courage, to direct any words about freedom to President Hosni Mubarak. It&apos;s not cause for alarm that there&apos;s no Obama doctrine yet. There was no Bush and no Clinton doctrine at this point. One may begin to take shape in Cairo, but I suspect two things. First, that it will be years in the making. Second, that it \u00adwill re-prove the imperishable insight that all the \u2013isms are now \u2013wasms."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/jun/02/breakfast-briefing", "publicationDate": "2009-06-02T05:00:00Z", "tags": ["Games", "Microsoft", "Sony", "Nintendo", "Amazon.com", "Ebooks", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Intriguing, then, that the E-Ink - the company that makes the crucial display technology for many ebooks was sold yesterday to Taiwan&apos;s Prime View International for just $215m."], "title": "Breakfast briefing: E3 wowed by Microsoft, E-Ink leaves them puzzled", "article": "\u00b7 The gaming world has converged on Los Angeles for E3, where yesterday EA and Ubisoft showed off their wares, while Microsoft stole the show with appearances by the Beatles, Steven Spielberg, and a host of very pretty gaming demos.

It would be available in Q3 2009.  The introduction of Android into Acer netbooks presents customers with another choice of operating system. In addition to Microsoft&apos;s operating system, the majority of Acer netbooks will also offer Android in the future. Users may then select their preferred choice of operating system. Acer believes the Android operating system will contribute significantly to the worldwide netbook market growth.  One of the benefits -- and drawbacks -- of Android is that it&apos;s open source so suppliers can customise it. One of the reasons Linux failed on netbooks was that the leading suppliers offered their own versions instead of uniting behind a common platform. It remains to be seen whether the netbook market will end up with different versions of Android, and how different they will be. However, shipping both Windows and Android on most Aspire One netbooks will remove the high cost of having separate stock-keeping units (SKUs) for Windows and Linux. It won&apos;t cost Acer anything to include it, and it should still benefit netbook buyers if they have a choice of operating system -- always assuming it&apos;s done as some sort of dual-boot system where you can switch between them. (Just offering users the option to delete Android during the first configuration makes no sense at all. They&apos;ll already have paid for Windows.) It remains to be seen how many Aspire One buyers might actually use Android because, in Q3, Acer will presumably start shipping netbooks running Windows 7. Even the Starter version (which no longer has the threatened limit of only being able to run three apps at once) looks better than Android.

We&apos;ll soon call them the new US industrial policy. America would do well to learn from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and now China \u2013 countries where government helped foster industries that became world leaders. But they did so under a different global trade regime. In order to recover from the crisis and address global imbalances the US needs to start producing again, rather than go back to credit-fuelled consumption binges. What&apos;s more, US production and consumption will have to be a lot more environmentally friendly. We recognise that. As part of the recovery, the US is bailing out our automobile industry and investing heavily in the energy sector \u2013 both of which the US hopes to &quot;green&quot; in the process. Most recently, the US said it will trade its debt from General Motors for equity. Such action would give Uncle Sam a 60% stake in company. The stimulus package will spend $52bn to build up a green energy industry.  Many will cry that industrial policy \u2013 government fostering of specific sectors, industries or firms \u2013 is protectionism. It certainly can be. These policies are justifiable only to the extent they correct for market failures in the economy. Of course we all know that the free market is failing to supply credit to firms in the real economy. There is also an underproduction of green technologies, because firms are not compensated for the environmental benefits they bring. This is accentuated because dirty producers don&apos;t have to pay for their environmental sins.  If US policy rectifies market failures, these policies should be seen as correctionism rather than protectionism. When pressed, economists acknowledge this. However, most are shy to advocate for industrial policy because government failure can be worse than market failure. What do government bureaucrats know about which sectors to invest in, let alone manage them? How can the government and the private sector collaborate without corruption? These points should be taken very seriously, because for every industrial policy success there&apos;s a failure. Brazil tried to build a world-class computer. Indonesia, cars. The list goes on.  Asian countries such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China have all successfully experimented with industrial policy. Conventional economic theories would have told these nations to produce rice, fish and perhaps some clothing for the world economy. However, over time governments enabled firms like Toyota, Kia, Hyundai, Acer and Lenovo to become household names across the world. Chinese cars are coming around the corner. China plans to export autos into the US by 2012. GM is assessing a bid for Hummer from the Chinese manufacturer Sichuan Tengzhong, and another for Saab from the Chinese auto firm, Geely. Geely and another Chinese firm, Chang&apos;An Auto, are reportedly also looking at buying Volvo. When countries succeed at industrial policy they usually form public-private partnerships, put conditions on favoured recipients and have systems for government accountability.  Public-private partnerships help alleviate the problem of governments picking winners by creating mechanisms whereby governments get important input from the private sector. Enforceable conditions are also important, such as performance requirements to export a certain percentage of output before receiving additional support. Government accountability needs to be ensured as well. The one catch is that Asia didn&apos;t have the current trading regime to worry about. Japan, South Korea and Taiwan largely deployed these policies before the WTO was formed. China build most of its capabilities before it joined the WTO in 2001. So in addition to orchestrating a system of partnerships, conditions and accountability, the US will have to change its stance in global trade negotiations. Many nations such as Brazil, South Africa, China and India (as well as the EU when it comes to green technologies) want the policy space to continue to build new and cleaner industries.  If the US wants cover for green industrial policy, it will have to grant that policy space to our trading partners so they can correct for market failures as well. If we don&apos;t get these other policies right, it could accentuate the crisis, cost the US taxpayer a lot of money and eventually come to roost at the ballot box."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jun/03/bolivia-chile-pacific-tunnel", "publicationDate": "2009-06-06T16:00:00Z", "tags": ["Bolivia", "Chile", "Environment", "Engineering", "International trade", "World news", "US news", "Americas"], "sentences": ["Eliash explained that many diplomatic, trade and migration-related problems are currently being resolved with tunnels in various parts of the world, including the construction of a tunnel between China and Taiwan."], "title": "Bolivia and Chile's tunnel vision | Benjamin Dangl", "article": "In the war of the Pacific in 1879, a conflict in part over access to guano for fertiliser, Chile took away Bolivia&apos;s only access to the Pacific Ocean. More than a century later, demands from Bolivia for the recuperation of this land are now louder than ever.  The most recently proposed solution to the diplomatic crisis seems to be straight out of a science fiction novel: the construction of a 150km tunnel from Bolivia to an artificial island created by the excavated dirt. The tunnel, proposed by three Chilean architects, would allow for regular vehicle transport and include a gas duct to export gas (Bolivia is home to extensive natural gas reserves).  Similar to many Bolivians&apos; demands for a fully nationalised gas industry and land reform, Bolivia&apos;s call for access to the ocean is bound up in a widespread desire to recuperate looted riches and natural wealth. However, this most recent proposal falls significantly short of the full access due to Bolivia, and seems to be yet another sign that Chile is not taking Bolivia seriously in its demands.  Tito Hoz de Vila, a Bolivian senator and president of the government&apos;s commission on foreign relations, said the tunnel idea was &quot;a mockery and insult to the intelligence of the Bolivian people&quot;. Bolivian President Evo Morales has been a strong advocate for access to the ocean, and in recent years has been in negotiations regarding the issue with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet.  Mariano Fern\u00e1ndez, the Chilean foreign minister, told reporters that he considered the tunnel plan &quot;an avant-garde proposal that will be interesting to hear about. \u2026 It&apos;s an important subject for Chile, very important for Bolivia and it&apos;s not easy to find ways to solve all our problems from one day to the next.&quot; Yet this time-consuming and expensive project is far from a solution, and more likely another way to delay action on the part of the Chileans.  David Choquehuanca, the Bolivian foreign minister, said that he &quot;laughed a bit&quot; when he heard of the proposed tunnel. The minister explained: &quot;What&apos;s important is that even imaginative people are speaking about sea access for Bolivia.&quot; Choquehuanca said he would not comment further on the proposal until it is officially presented by his Chilean counterpart.  After a meeting between President Bachelet and Fidel Castro in Cuba last February, Castro wrote a column in which he criticised Chile for not respecting Bolivia&apos;s demands for access to the sea. He wrote that the Chilean &quot;oligarchy&quot; has been denying Bolivia its ocean port, and that the land taken over by Chile contains the largest copper reserve in the world, providing the Chilean economy with millions of dollars each year. This is another reason Chile should simply give over the land that is indeed Bolivia&apos;s. Humberto Eliash, one of the Chilean architects proposing the tunnel, told the BBC: &quot;Poets say that we must build a bridge between Bolivia and the Pacific that jumps over Chile. We wanted to see if it could work in reality.&quot; But instead of going high above ground, Eliash and his colleagues are looking underground.  The tunnel would be one of the longest in the world and take approximately a decade to complete. &quot;In the beginning, we thought the idea was a little crazy, but now we think it can really be viable,&quot; Eliash said. &quot;I see this as a possible dream, not madness.&quot; But such a plan does appear to verge on madness, especially when he proposes that the impoverished country of Bolivia should cover the tab. Taking a decade to complete would also allow politicians to simply push away responsibility for fully addressing this urgent issue.  Eliash explained that many diplomatic, trade and migration-related problems are currently being resolved with tunnels in various parts of the world, including the construction of a tunnel between China and Taiwan. The architect also cited the plans to connect Spain to Morocco through a tunnel.  A major challenge faced by such construction in Bolivia and Chile is financial. The architects suggest that Bolivia fund the costly project, using the profits generated by the sea port to help recover costs. According to the proposal, part of the tunnel would pass under Peru, and later resurface in the Pacific in a territory owned by Chile, Bolivia and Peru. These factors could all create political problems with Peru. And recently, Peruvian-Bolivian relations have taken a turn for the worse.  Peru has made the deplorable decision of offering refuge to ex-ministers under former Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. The ex-ministers are accused by the Bolivian government of being involved in the 2003 massacre of 67people in the Gas war, a popular uprising which developed in part due to outrage over a plan to export Bolivian gas to the US through a Chilean \u2013 formerly Bolivian \u2013 port.  Morales told reporters that relations with Peru are now at &quot;high risk&quot; after what he said was a &quot;provocation and an open aggression&quot; by Peruvian President Alan Garcia. The trial against Sanchez de Lozada and his cohorts began on 18 May in Bolivia. If Chile formally proposes the tunnel option, it is difficult to say what Morales&apos;s response will be. In previous speeches, he has said he will never give up fighting for Bolivia&apos;s access to the sea, and in early March promised that &quot;if we recuperate Bolivia&apos;s access to the sea, I promise I will dance the [traditional] Morenada dance at Carnaval.&quot;  Yet when Morales made that promise he was talking about full access to the land and ports stolen by Chile in an unfair war over a century ago. He wasn&apos;t talking about an incredibly costly, dangerous, time-consuming and, thanks to relations with Peru, diplomatically impossible tunnel. It&apos;s time for the Chilean government to start taking its Andean neighbour seriously in its demands for recuperation of the land and resources that are rightfully Bolivian and stop suggesting proposals that will only worsen diplomatic relations, not help them."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jun/11/intel-culv-sean-maloney", "publicationDate": "2009-06-10T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Intel", "Technology"], "sentences": ["He&apos;d gone to Russia from Taiwan, where he gave a keynote speech at last week&apos;s Computex trade show, and on Monday, he emailed me from another WiMax event in Tokyo.", "Culv was big at Computex Taiwan, I remind him, with Acer, Asus and MSI all backing Intel&apos;s new chip set."], "title": "Interview: Sean Maloney,  executive vice president of Intel", "article": "Any Englishman (or woman) would describe Sean Maloney as a good bloke. He&apos;s a rugby fan who supports Bath and England, loves rowing, and looks comfortable wearing jeans. He was the youngest of six, and didn&apos;t finish his diploma course at Thames Poly before getting into programming and discovering an enthusiasm for computing. What&apos;s unusual about this former lad from Lewisham is that he&apos;s executive vice-president of Intel, and its chief sales and marketing officer, which makes him one of the US&apos;s top businessmen. Or, rather, the world&apos;s. When I met him for lunch in London on Friday, he&apos;d just got off a plane after a WiMax launch in St Petersburg. He&apos;d gone to Russia from Taiwan, where he gave a keynote speech at last week&apos;s Computex trade show, and on Monday, he emailed me from another WiMax event in Tokyo. Around 80% of Intel&apos;s business comes from outside the US, and Maloney reckons he spends about half his time travelling. But he&apos;s due some time off, and his holiday will include watching some rugby in South Africa. Blunt force It&apos;s not the kind of lifestyle he&apos;d envisaged in the 1970s, when he was selling leftwing newspapers outside the dock gates in London (his grandfather had been a docker), but joining Intel helped change that. It gave him the chance to rise through the ranks in the UK then move to the US, where he spent a couple of years as Andy Grove&apos;s assistant. Grove, who had arrived in the US as a refugee from Hungary, built Intel: he was like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer rolled into one. What was it like working for him? &quot;He was extremely blunt,&quot; says Maloney. &quot;We had some very blunt arguments. As a manager he was extraordinarily demanding: he paid you the compliment of taking your word seriously, and then expecting you to do better. You owe that to the people who work for you, who put so much of their lives into their jobs. He paid me an extreme level of attention, which is what I wanted: life goes by in a flash, so you might as well do your best!&quot; Much of the world runs on Intel processors, and Maloney&apos;s current task is encouraging the adoption of WiMax wireless networking, which is like longer-range Wi-Fi - but isn&apos;t being adopted as rapidly as hoped. Intel is also making an impact with the Atom chip, which is at the heart of the netbook market, and the new Culv (consumer ultra low voltage) platform. Culv was big at Computex Taiwan, I remind him, with Acer, Asus and MSI all backing Intel&apos;s new chip set. Was I right in thinking Culv was driving a wedge between netbooks and notebooks? &quot;That was the idea,&quot; Maloney says, &quot;but that&apos;s not what&apos;s happened. It turns out you can tune your manufacturing processes for higher clock speeds or for lower power consumption. And we found that in all the market segments, there was utility in coming out with better battery life, lower temperatures, less electricity use. Now it&apos;s a parallel universe, where each processor will have its own shadow.&quot; Maloney reckons Culv chips will lead to thin notebooks that have extraordinary battery life, probably eight or nine hours instead of three or four. Intel is investing more than $7bn in factories to produce smaller 32nm versions of its chips, which it hopes will take battery life over 12 hours. Intel had low-power chips before, of course, but they weren&apos;t x86 software (DOS/Windows) compatible: they were based on ARM designs, which dominate the markets for PDAs and mobiles. But after acquiring what had been Digital&apos;s StrongARM business and changing it to XScale, Intel sold it on. How did that make sense? &quot;XScale still exists and it&apos;s doing well,&quot; says Maloney, &quot;but we were the 14th or 15th ARM licensee, and didn&apos;t really bring that much to the party. In 2003-04, we were trying to prioritise between doing another version of ARM or doing another version of Banias [the Centrino processor]. We had a budget crunch and we didn&apos;t have the headcount to do both. We realised we had a greater commitment to x86 so we shifted resources to that. It turned out to be a strategic decision.&quot; So instead of having its own ARM range, Intel is now driving into ARM territory with the Atom chip - and, of course, ARM chips are starting to attack the low end of the netbook market with what Qualcomm is calling smartbooks. But does the Atom make economic sense? Microsoft took a financial hit by selling cheap copies of Windows XP into the netbook market instead of Vista: doesn&apos;t it hurt Intel to sell cheap Atom chips instead of more expensive Core 2 Duos? Mighty Atom Maloney doesn&apos;t think there&apos;s too much cannibalisation of sales at the low end - 80% of netbook buyers wouldn&apos;t have bought a notebook - and he sees a big netbook market emerging for the 7-12 age group. But, he says: &quot;The alarm bells should ring if you&apos;re defending a business - it&apos;s a wake-up call.&quot; The message is: &quot;Do it to yourself before someone does it to you.&quot; Intel has followed up on the Atom by buying a software supplier, Wind River Systems, for $884m. That doesn&apos;t seem to make sense either, because Wind River has been supporting the ARM camp, and Intel already had Mobilon, its own version of Linux tuned for netbooks. &quot;We&apos;re moving Atom into the embedded [processor] market, and Linux is the game there,&quot; he says. &quot;Wind River is bulking out our knowledge in embedded applications.&quot; In other words, to penetrate the business for chips in TVs, set-top boxes and portable devices, Intel needs Wind River to provide the sort of support for Atom that it provides for ARM. It&apos;s an answer to the chicken-and-egg problem of hardware needing software, and vice versa. Intel is aiming the Atom at the market for MIDs (Mobile Internet Devices), and perhaps even mobile phones, where x86 chips have not been able to go because of their high power requirements. These sell in much bigger quantities than PCs, which ship about 300m a year, but without much of a price premium. Maloney says that with the Atom &quot;we knew we were going to make lower margins than ever before, so we had to design it that way, using different people, with a different culture. We made a decision to go that way, so that&apos;s what we did. If we can&apos;t make money in high-volume, low-cost markets, we&apos;re doomed anyway. &quot;That&apos;s not to say it wasn&apos;t an emotional discussion,&quot; he says. &quot;It was. It still is.&quot; The chip business has always been a bit of a gamble, and in this case, Intel is betting tens of billions of dollars. It&apos;s something for Maloney to think about when he&apos;s at home in Palo Alto, rowing his wooden Carl Douglas boat around, watching the dawn break over San Francisco bay. He could, after all, be Intel&apos;s next chief executive."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/jun/19/disney-netpal-asus-netbook", "publicationDate": "2009-06-19T00:21:00Z", "tags": ["Netbooks", "Walt Disney Company", "Technology", "Asus"], "sentences": ["DigiTimes in Taiwan says the XP-based Netpal &quot;is durable with a reinforced mechanical design, while offering a unique Disney user interface&quot;."], "title": "Pink and Blue Disney netbooks coming from Asus", "article": "Steve Jobs&apos; other company is entering the Windows netbook market with the Disney Netpal, aimed at children aged 6-12.

There is no prospect of China ruling the world. This is a country whose uncertainties of identity and economic frailties prevent it from ever projecting hegemonic hard and soft power. Its authoritarian institutions, far from being a source of strength, are a source of weakness. China is simultaneously big but poor, powerful but weak. And there, until wholesale political change occurs, it will stay, notwithstanding its considerable growth rates and economic achievement. Indeed, its current economic model, dependent on high exports and mountainous savings, is disintegrating, as both insiders and close observers recognise. Martin Jacques partially acknowledges that economic problems exist even as he breathlessly rehearses the economically impossible extrapolations of China&apos;s recent growth far into the future. His intellectual difficulty is that he needs to make the grandiose claim that China will rule the world to drive home his interesting thesis that western-defined modernity - the belief in the marriage of democracy, Enlightenment values, capitalism and progress - is about to be contested seriously for the first time by a non-western power.  China is not a nation state, he writes, but a civilisation state. As such, it cannot make accommodations with others as it rises. It will be condemned to be true to its past; rather than submit to multilateral law and institutions, it will &quot;feel free to be what it thinks it is and act accordingly to its history and instincts which are those of a civilisation state&quot;.  Historically, China has regarded itself as being at the centre of the world and has sought tribute from others as acknowledgement of its inherent superiority, a racism that is embedded in the Chinese psyche, Jacques argues provocatively. Its instincts remain essentially Confucian: a strong central state seeking benevolently and collectively to improve the condition of the people. Communism is a contemporary expression of Confucianism. This is the most eyecatching part of what is in essence another of the Beware China is coming, Asian values are superior books. However, the affinity between Confucianism and communism is hardly a new insight. Liu Shaoqi, one of the party&apos;s five leaders in the 1940s, drew a parallel between the self-discipline and self-cultivation needed to be a Confucian scholar and becoming an effective communist. Where Jacques scores is in arguing that it is Chinese civilisation, rather than the Communist party, that will drive China.  Yet the more I reflect on the idea of a civilisation state standing in tension with a conventional nation state, the less am I persuaded the distinction holds. Britain, France, Germany and the US are also civilisation states, defined as much by their different cultures and histories as their jurisdictional boundaries, languages and national assemblies. All in varying ways are creatures of the European Enlightenment; all can trace core values to republican Rome and the philosophers of Greece.  Western states frequently do not meet their own standards any more than China does. But I agree with Rousseau, Kant and Paine that all human beings have a sense of self and are thus worthy of equal respect as individuals, as I agree with Aristotle and Plato about the importance of due desert underpinning justice. There is a universal hunger for these values which does not stop at China&apos;s borders because of some mystical adherence to Asian values. We all want to live lives we have reason to value - whether we are Chinese or British. Indeed, the processes thrown up by the western tradition - the rule of law, the drive to experiment and innovate, the prevalence of free argument and exchange of ideas - also drive successful, long-term economic performance. China can approach the frontier of technological knowledge developed by others, but it has a limited capacity to get beyond it. It is deeply corrupt, deeply uninnovative, deeply environmentally wasteful and these deformations can be traced back to its lack of institutions rooted in Enlightenment values. China has no checks and balances; it needs them.  The great reforming revolutionary Sun Yat-Sen wanted them for China; the Tiananmen protesters in Beijing and other cities across China risked their lives for them; Charter 08, instigated by more than 300 Chinese intellectuals last December, campaigns for them; and the Chinese in Taiwan have succeeded partially in implanting them. Jacques&apos;s argument implies that Chinese workers don&apos;t want representation at work, nor Chinese shareholders any influence on company managements, nor Chinese citizens to hold their government to account. It is profoundly mistaken. The majority do want these things and the fact they don&apos;t have them holds China back.  China cannot build its economy for ever on a savings rate of 40 per cent of GDP, or exports growing at such a rate that by 2020 they will constitute half of the world&apos;s merchandise exports. The model is cracking because it must. China must save less and consume more, as Jacques acknowledges.  But it will not make the transition without political change. The Chinese save because they do not trust the future. They know the Communist party&apos;s grip is unsustainable. The real story of the next generation will be of the west drawing ahead of a China facing political turmoil and increasing economic difficulties. The problem we will have to manage is not China ruling the world. It will be of bridging the already high and growing gap between the west and the rest. Martin Jacques&apos;s extensive research is marred by the book&apos;s central thesis. He is too suspicious of the west to offer real insight into the future. \u2022 Will Hutton is the author of The Writing on the Wall: China and the West in the 21st Century (Abacus)"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/jun/22/laura-robson-wimbledon-debut-daniela-hantuchova", "publicationDate": "2009-06-21T23:05:02Z", "tags": ["Wimbledon", "Tennis", "Sport", "Laura Robson", "Wimbledon 2009"], "sentences": ["I think she&apos;ll just treat it very professionally.&quot; Roger Federer, who in the absence of the champion, Rafael Nadal, will be the first man on Centre Court, playing \u00adYen-Hsun Lu of Taiwan, said that nobody should read too much into his four successive defeats by Murray."], "title": "British wild card Robson prepares for debut", "article": "Britain&apos;s Laura Robson, last year&apos;s junior Wimbledon champion, steps out for the first time in the main draw of a grand slam this morning, with many in the tennis world convinced that the 15-year-old will soon be treading the same path to the top of the sport as Andy Murray. &quot;Here is another great player coming,&quot; said Peter Lundgren, a former coach of Roger Federer. &quot;She is the best girl I have seen in a long time.

I&apos;m standing astride a bike crafted from an armful of bamboo cane, about to push out into rush-hour traffic. As a material for a bicycle frame, it makes more sense than it sounds. In Asian countries it&apos;s often used as scaffolding, and even to reinforce concrete, so it&apos;s certainly strong. But the important part is that it&apos;s also incredibly springy. Next time you&apos;re on your bike, find somewhere away from traffic and look down at your frame when you set off. Most people don&apos;t realise that bikes are not rigid, they warp and bend slightly when you ride them. The largest of my bikes flexes so much when I corner hard that I can actually feel it distort underneath me. As well as such practicality, bamboo offers sustainability \u2013 so long as it&apos;s done right. Some bamboo production is far from green, causing biodiversity problems and creating toxic dioxins from treatment with chlorine. The cane used here, though, is reportedly grown responsibly in Taiwan&apos;s Yushan national park, and hand-picked before being shipped to bike manufacturer Calfee&apos;s California headquarters. It&apos;s also smoked and heat treated, rather than chemically hardened. There are definite environmental benefits to using bamboo as a raw material: it grows extremely quickly, requires minimal pesticides and water and is a prolific producer of oxygen. So, why not build bikes from it, rather than more energy-intensive steel or carbon? Well, people have. In fact, look up English patent number 8274, filed in 1894, and you&apos;ll see that it&apos;s far from a new idea. It&apos;s just never taken off. Craig Calfee intends to change all that. He was one of the early pioneers of carbon fibre bikes, and he&apos;s been experimenting with bamboo since 2005. He now builds high-end bamboo racing, mountain and cargo bikes, and is working on bringing cheap and simple utility bikes to Africa. Because of the climate there, the raw material grows well, and local people could be trained to produce the frames themselves. It&apos;s one of Calfee&apos;s racing bikes I&apos;m riding today, all \u00a33,000 of it (available in the UK via Eco Age). Worryingly, it&apos;s incredibly light and looks fragile, but it does come with a 10-year guarantee. So, what does it feel like to ride? When you played with a bamboo cane as a child, and swished it through the air, it felt like energy incarnate. That&apos;s a little how this bike feels to ride. When I first sprint off, nothing happens for a split second, just like when you swish that bamboo cane. Then, almost before you&apos;ve noticed, it springs ahead as though it has more energy than you&apos;ve put in. It rivals carbon, steel, anything I&apos;ve ridden. It&apos;s also comfortable. But not like a big, heavy commuter bike with large, bouncy tires. It just soaks up the bumps, with no lolling around. The incredible part of this bike is that this feel comes from something that grows naturally \u2013 technically, it&apos;s a grass. It&apos;s simply harvested and crafted in a workshop. It&apos;s not a hi-tech carbon fibre bike which has been moulded, layered, glued, baked and finished. Even the joints are made of natural hemp. But will it become the next big material for bike builders? In the developing world it makes perfect sense, but it will be a big task to oust carbon fibre in the west. It took almost a decade for riders to trust that material, and bamboo somehow feels even more alien than that did. Maybe everyone should have a test-ride on Calfee&apos;s bike."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/25/sharks-extinction-iucn-red-list", "publicationDate": "2009-06-24T23:00:00Z", "tags": ["Endangered species", "Conservation", "Science", "Biodiversity", "Marine life", "Zoology", "Environment", "Fishing", "Wildlife", "Oceans", "Animals", "IUCN red list of endangered species"], "sentences": ["The top five \u2013 Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Spain and Mexico \u2013 accounted for 42%."], "title": "One third of all oceanic shark species at risk of extinction", "article": "Overfishing threatens to drive a third of the world&apos;s open-ocean shark species to extinction, say conservationists. Hammerheads, giant devil rays and porbeagle sharks are among 64 species on the first ever red list for oceanic sharks produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Sharks are vulnerable because they can take decades to mature and they produce few young. The scalloped hammerhead shark, which has declined by 99% over the past 30 years in some parts of the world, is particularly vulnerable and has been given globally endangered status on the red list, which means it is nearing extinction. In the Gulf of Mexico, the oceanic whitetip shark has declined by a similar amount. Scientists estimate that shark populations in the north-west Atlantic Ocean have declined by an average of 50% since the early 1970s. Announcing the red list of open-ocean or &quot;pelagic&quot; sharks and rays today, scientists called on governments to set limits for catching the animals on the high seas and to enforce strict bans on &quot;finning&quot; \u2013 the practice of catching sharks, cutting off their fins and throwing the bodies back in the water. &quot;Despite mounting threats, sharks remain virtually unprotected on the high seas,&quot; said Sonja Fordham, deputy chair of the shark specialist group at the IUCN and policy director for the Shark Alliance. &quot;The vulnerability and lengthy migrations of most open-ocean sharks call for coordinated, international conservation plans. Our report documents serious overfishing of these species in national and international waters, and demonstrates a clear need for immediate action on a global scale.&quot; Pelagic sharks are usually caught on the high seas in tuna or swordfish fisheries. In 2007, 21 shark-fishing nations reported catching more than 10,000 tonnes of shark. The top five \u2013 Indonesia, India, Taiwan, Spain and Mexico \u2013 accounted for 42%. At one time, sharks were considered worthless bycatch, but they are increasingly being fished on purpose to serve emerging markets for their meat and fins, which are used in soups and can fetch more than \u00a3100 per kilogram. In places such as China, shark-fin soup could once only be afforded by the elite, but the growing numbers of middle-class people in the country has driven up demand. To satisfy the growing market, some fishermen have taken to finning sharks. There are bans on this practice in operation around the world, but Fordham said the coverage is patchy and, in any case, enforcing the bans is difficult due to a lack of policing on the high seas. &quot;The overarching problem for sharks is that, for a variety of reasons, they&apos;ve been considered low priority and they&apos;re traditionally low value compared with something like the tuna,&quot; said Fordham. &quot;Also public image feeds into that \u2013 I don&apos;t know if there are people clamouring for their conservation.&quot; Most species of pelagic shark take many years to mature and have relatively few young when they do reproduce. The IUCN&apos;s report highlights a study by scientists in Canada which showed that the population of porbeagle sharks, classified as vulnerable in the red list, has been so affected by fishing that it will take at least 100 years to recover. Yet the government still allows the animal to be fished in its waters. The global dusky shark popualtion, also classed as vulnerable by the IUCN, could take up to 400 years to recover because the animals are not sexually mature until around 20 years of age and usually raise only one offspring at a time. Fordham said that because many of the sharks on the red list are at the top of the food chain, their extinction could also cause major local ecological problems. &quot;We know that most of these species are top predators and we know that removing the top predators usually has negative consequences to the system as a whole.&quot; In 2007, Julia Baum of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California, who is also a member of IUCN shark specialist group, published a study showing how a major decline in the numbers of predatory sharks in the north Atlantic after 2000 had allowed populations of cownose rays, which are their prey, to explode. The rays in turn decimated the populations of bay scallop off North Carolina. &quot;There was a fishery for bay scallops in North Carolina that lasted over a century uninterrupted and it was closed down in 2004 because of cownose rays,&quot; she said last year. Conserving threatened shark species might not be difficult. Last year, Peter Klimley of the University of California, Davis, found that scalloped hammerhead sharks migrate along fixed &quot;superhighways&quot; in the oceans, speeding between a series of &quot;stepping stone&quot; sites near coastal islands ranging from Mexico to Ecuador. Focusing marine reserves around these hotspots might be a cost-effective way to conserve the species. The IUCN sharks red list is published a few days before Spain is due to host an international meeting of the managers of tuna fisheries, where many of the sharks are caught. Scientists are also meeting in Denmark this week to produce advice for authorities on how to manage populations of Atlantic porbeagle sharks. &quot;The completion of this global assessment of pelagic sharks and rays will provide an important baseline for monitoring the status of these keystone species in our oceans,&quot; said Roger McManus, vice-president for marine programmes at Conservation International. \u2022 This article was amended on Friday 26 June 2009.

Rather, it is taking steps to do this, and so has resumed reprocessing spent fuel rods.   North Korea today threatened to retaliate with a nuclear &quot;fire shower&quot; if it is attacked by the US and warned it would expand its nuclear arsenal, a month after it carried out a controlled nuclear explosion in defiance of the UN security council. The regime used the 59th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war to step up its threats against the US, whose navy is tracking a North Korean vessel off the Chinese coast that is suspected of carrying weapons. Earlier this month the UN banned all weapons exports from North Korea in response to the May 25 nuclear test, its second in three years. The latest warning came as speculation mounted that Pyongyang is preparing to test launch short- and medium-range missiles. North Korea has banned ships from the waters off its east coast until July 10 for &quot;military exercises&quot;, but South Korean and US intelligence officials do not believe the tests will involve a long-range Taepodong-2 missile, which is theoretically capable of reaching Hawaii. Yesterday President Barack Obama extended Washington&apos;s sanctions against North Korea for another year and warned that the regime&apos;s nuclear weapons programme posed &quot;an unusual and extraordinary threat&quot; to the US. North Korea, which is thought to possess between five and seven nuclear bombs, recently restarted its main nuclear reactor, which is capable of reprocessing spent fuel rods used in the production of weapons-grade plutonium. In Pyongyang the state-run media accused the US of provoking the Korean war \u2013 most historians agree the conflict was started by the North \u2013 and of looking for an excuse to launch another attack. The Rodong Sinmun newspaper said the North had every right to defend itself in the face of what it called US hostility. The regime &quot;will never give up its nuclear deterrent \u2026 and will further strengthen it,&quot; it said. The newspaper said a recent US pledge to use nuclear weapons to defend South Korea amounted to &quot;asking for the calamitous situation of having a fire shower of nuclear retaliation all over South Korea&quot;. The three-year Korean war ended in 1953 with a fragile truce and the creation of the most heavily fortified border in the world. Last month Pyongyang said it was no longer bound by the armistice after the South agreed to take part in US-led searches of vessels suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction. The ship now being tracked by a US navy destroyer has reportedly cleared the Taiwan Strait and is thought to be heading to Burma with a shipment of conventional munitions. The US and its allies have yet to decide whether to intercept and search the ship, a move that North Korea said it would view as a declaration of war."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/jun/28/jay-rayner-reviews-keelung-london", "publicationDate": "2009-06-27T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Restaurants", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "sentences": ["I had hoped for great things from Keelung, which is Taiwanese.", "While reports I&apos;ve read - I&apos;ve never been there - indicate that food in China has come on immensely in the past decade, it has long been held that Taiwan, to where the aristocracy and their chefs retreated after the communist victory in 1949, is the true torch bearer for Chinese gastronomy.", "What remained of chef culture in China had to deal with the privations and ideological strictures of endless purges and cultural revolutions; in Taiwan, meanwhile, chefs were allowed to pursue as many Chinese traditions as they wished.", "From the bizarrely named night-time market tapas menu - clearly from that bit of Taiwan just to the edge of Seville - came a dry piece of braised pork in a pleasingly soft pancake.", "Unless, of course, you&apos;re Taiwanese and pining for the taste of an impoverished life back home."], "title": "Jay Rayner reviews Keelung, London WC2", "article": "Keelung, 6 Lisle Street, Leicester Square,London WC2(020 7734 8128).Meal for two, including service, \u00a375 We stared at the menu, my friend and I, both baffled and bemused. We&apos;d seen a document like this before and we knew exactly where: pinned to our respective fridges by magnets. It looked just like the star charts we used to coax our children into eating their greens and not torturing their siblings with pliers. Down the side was a list of seafood. Along the top was a variety of cooking methods. Across the grid were a bunch of stars, listed as &quot;chef&apos;s recommendations&quot;.  I have always been deeply suspicious of this sort of thing. Generally I go to restaurants hoping that smart people, who have spent a long time learning to cook, will offer me things to eat which they know taste nice. Giving diners the opportunity to make it up can only end badly, as indeed it did, though not in the manner expected. Still, I do put our troubles down to the complexity of the menu, or should I say menus, for we were up to our nipples in the damn things: not merely the star chart, but the chef&apos;s specials, and the list of &quot;night-time market tapas&quot;, and the congee and so on. Too much reading. I had hoped for great things from Keelung, which is Taiwanese. While reports I&apos;ve read - I&apos;ve never been there - indicate that food in China has come on immensely in the past decade, it has long been held that Taiwan, to where the aristocracy and their chefs retreated after the communist victory in 1949, is the true torch bearer for Chinese gastronomy. What remained of chef culture in China had to deal with the privations and ideological strictures of endless purges and cultural revolutions; in Taiwan, meanwhile, chefs were allowed to pursue as many Chinese traditions as they wished.  Keelung is certainly a grown-up space, all clean, dark wood and shiny wine racks, plus an icy display of seafood in the window (though the choice of photographs - Marilyn Monroe, the Shadows, Cliff Richard - makes random look considered). Could it be that London&apos;s Chinatown, once the place to go for a reliable level of quality, for too long the place to go to have your mouth brutalised, would once again have a restaurant worthy of it? No, actually, it wouldn&apos;t. A couple of the dishes were good but one of those, the crispy chilli beef, was only ordered to see how they managed an old stager: beef that crunched between the teeth, a sauce the colour of Dale Winton, not too cloying, a little heat. The other was a basket of crab siu long bao, tiny dumplings whose casings held a bolus of meat surrounded by broth. Eat in one go or the stock dribbles down your chin. Much else was mediocre to bad. A dish of pig&apos;s liver with morning glory, a crisp green vegetable, should hit you in the face with its offal origins. If it doesn&apos;t there&apos;s no point to it. I would have needed the menu description to identify the meat. Sea-spiced spare ribs were tough and lukewarm. From the bizarrely named night-time market tapas menu - clearly from that bit of Taiwan just to the edge of Seville - came a dry piece of braised pork in a pleasingly soft pancake. And then there was the order from the star chart. I can suggest half a dozen places in London which do prawns kung pao better than here and which would include the necessary peanuts rather than just dunking them in a slick of something bronze and surrounding them with red chillies. After that I wanted to prove how silly these ordering sheets are by choosing a piece of fish cooked in a style not recommended by the chef, in this case mackerel in preserved vegetables.  It turns out the kitchen wouldn&apos;t let you do that, which is a good thing. But then why have the star chart? Flustered, I went for something else. Which is why we ended up with half the head of a salmon: jaws, teeth, eyes, everything. Not that I realised immediately. It took a bit of spoonwork to get there. It&apos;s proof again that authentic isn&apos;t the same as good. Unless, of course, you&apos;re Taiwanese and pining for the taste of an impoverished life back home. They accepted it had been a mistake but frankly it wasn&apos;t worth the effort: an insipid, slippery, flavourless piece of fish, beneath a sodden pile of forest-floor leaf mulch. Another searing disappointment in London&apos;s Chinatown, and certainly not deserving of a star on anybody&apos;s chart. \u2022 jay.rayner@observer.co.uk"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/28/elephant-dna-illegal-ivory-trade", "publicationDate": "2009-06-27T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Conservation", "Wildlife", "Forensic science", "Endangered species", "Science", "Animals", "Tanzania", "Mozambique", "US news", "World news", "Environment", "Africa", "Illegal wildlife trade"], "sentences": ["The extent of this trade is revealed through recent seizures of thousands of tusks in separate raids on docks in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan.", "In this way, Wasser and his colleagues analysed ivory seized when more than 11 tonnes of tusks were found in containers in raids on Taiwan and Hong Kong docks in July and August 2006."], "title": "Map of elephant DNA reveals trail of ivory smugglers", "article": "Scientists have used a revolutionary genetic technique to pinpoint the area of Africa where smugglers are slaughtering elephants to feed the worldwide illegal ivory trade. Using a DNA map of Africa&apos;s elephants, they have found that most recent seizures of tusks can be traced to animals that had grazed in the Selous and Niassa game reserves on the Tanzania and Mozambique borders. The discovery suggests that only a handful of cartels are responsible for most of the world&apos;s booming trade in illegal ivory and for the annual slaughter of tens of thousands of elephants. The extent of this trade is revealed through recent seizures of thousands of tusks in separate raids on docks in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the Philippines and Japan. These were aimed at satisfying the far east&apos;s growing appetite for ivory, a new status symbol for the middle classes of the region&apos;s swelling industrialised economies. As a result, ivory prices have soared from $200 a kilogram in 2004 to more than $6,000. At the same time, scientists estimate that between 8% and 10% of Africa&apos;s elephants are now being slaughtered each year to meet demand. &quot;In the past, law enforcement agencies - including Interpol - thought these shipments of ivory had been put together by traders cherry-picking small stockpiles across Africa,&quot; said Professor Sam Wasser, director of the University of Washington&apos;s Centre for Conservation Biology, where the DNA elephant map was developed. &quot;Our work shows that isn&apos;t true. The vast majority of poaching is being carried out by a few big organisations - possibly one or two major syndicates - that are targeting one area and then hammering its elephants. It is grim, but it also suggests we can target our anti-poaching efforts very specifically by focussing efforts on these regions.&quot; At present, Tanzania is at the centre of the world&apos;s ivory slaughter. However, other work by Wasser and his team indicates that different areas, including parts of Zambia and Malawi, have been targeted in the recent past. Ivory poaching was halted by an international campaign in the 1990s after it reached a peak between 1979 and 1989, when more than 700,000 elephants were killed for their tusks. However, aid that helps African nations fight poachers has dried up and the illegal ivory trade has returned to its previous high levels. Killing for tusks is a particularly gruesome trade. Elephants are highly intelligent animals whose sophisticated social ties are exploited by poachers. They will often shoot young elephants to draw in a grieving parent, which is then killed for its tusks. &quot;Our estimates suggest that more than 38,000 elephants were killed using techniques such as this in 2006 and that the annual death rate is even higher today,&quot; said Wasser. His team&apos;s technique - outlined in the current issue of Scientific American - involves two separate sets of analyses. First, volunteers and researchers across Africa collected samples of elephant dung. Each contains plentiful amounts of DNA from cells, sloughed from the intestines of individual animals. These provide material for DNA fingerprints, which have since been mapped for the whole of Africa. Animals from one area have very similar DNA fingerprints, the researchers have found. As part of the second analysis, a section of tusk seized from smugglers is ground up and its DNA is carefully extracted. Again a DNA fingerprint is made and compared with those on the dung map, in order to pinpoint the origin of the elephant. In this way, Wasser and his colleagues analysed ivory seized when more than 11 tonnes of tusks were found in containers in raids on Taiwan and Hong Kong docks in July and August 2006. About 1,500 tusks were discovered and all were traced to elephants from the Selous game reserve, a Unesco heritage site in Tanzania, and the nearby Niassa game reserve in Mozambique. However, Japanese authorities - who had made another seizure of ivory that summer in Osaka - refused to co-operate and have since burnt the 260 tusks they found before their origins could be established. &quot;You can draw your own conclusions,&quot; said Wasser.

Until last weekend, world leaders were unanimous in their condemnation of the so-called military coup. But having been forced to watch the spectacle continue for a second straight week, the world has now become painfully aware of two things they had not anticipated. The first is how ardent, unanimous, and organized the interim government in Honduras is against any sort of reprieve for Zelaya, much less his reinstatement. The second is how erratic and unfit for leadership Zelaya has become. Both realisations have caused diplomats to rethink their strategies in the push for Zelaya&apos;s immediate and unrestricted return to power. As the standoff continues this week, the international community would be wise to bite its tongue and instead, push for what world leaders initially called a &quot;Honduran solution&quot; \u2013 even if it&apos;s not the one they had in mind.  Last week&apos;s stance was simple: whether or not Zelaya&apos;s ouster is deemed a coup or not, removal of a democratically elected president by military force cannot be endorsed. With little further understanding of the contemporary politics of Honduras, this was the starting point with which the international community reacted. Initially, it appeared highly unlikely that the interim government assembled last week would be able to resist the mounting international pressure and growing isolation to reinstate Zelaya. Central American neighbours temporarily closed their borders to Honduras, donor agencies suspended aid, and some governments even threatened military intervention. As of last week, not a single country had agreed to recognise Roberto Micheletti as the new head of state. For one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere, economic and political isolation in the name of liberty is simply not tenable, so the reasoning went.  Over the weekend, that reasoning changed. On Sunday, Zelaya&apos;s triumphant return was stymied by a determined Honduran military, and bolstered by popular support for the interim government. Zelaya&apos;s premature and embarrassing return attempt may well prove to be the turning point in this high-stakes drama. As the clock ticks on Zelaya&apos;s comeback, the option of moving up November&apos;s elections to September becomes an increasingly appealing resolution for the international community. Widely reviled by the political class in Honduras (including the leaders of his own Honduran Liberal Party), Zelaya is now known not only as the hapless president ousted at gunpoint in his pajamas, but also by his atrocious governance record and erratic behaviour \u2013 which includes nearly doubling the minimum wage to the severe detriment of his country&apos;s economy, repeatedly refusing to submit a 2009 budget to congress, and ultimately disavowing both legislative and judicial checks on his power. Some countries, such as Canada, Taiwan and Israel are beginning to hedge their initial tacit support for Zelaya&apos;s return. Others that were only last week pushing for Zelaya&apos;s reinstatement are starting to realise that the bloodshed and turmoil that his return would inevitably cause may simply not be worth the trouble.  With the standoff as it is, key international leaders and organisations should take the following steps \u2013 some of which they may already be doing behind closed doors - to help Honduras move forward.  First, someone in Micheletti&apos;s circle needs to help his interim government understand the necessity of managing its international public relations to help position itself for the coming negotiations. Loyalist partisans now serving as spokespeople for the government have failed miserably in persuading anyone outside of Tegucigalpa that the Honduran constitution \u2013 which has no single mention of a provision for the removal of a president from office \u2013 provides a legal basis for their actions. Blind intransigence worked to create the impasse thus far, but it will undercut their position as they seek to regain the confidence and repeal the sanctions of their allies, as well to placate a confused and increasingly indignant Honduran population.  Second, outsiders must ratchet down the rhetoric on &quot;the future of Hemispheric democracy,&quot; the pressure to cut out aid for the poor, and the impending loss of OAS membership. They should focus less on pure democratic principles \u2013 which have clearly failed Hondurans in one way or another over the past several months \u2013 and more on pragmatic solutions that take into account both the precarious conditions on the ground and alternative resolutions that don&apos;t necessarily include Zelaya&apos;s full restoration.  Third, as Zelaya returns this week to Washington DC for meetings, key players like Hillary Clinton and Jose Miguel Insulza should take the opportunity to privately remind Zelaya and his entourage that without widespread international support, he would quickly join the lonely ranks of other regional coup victims such as Haiti&apos;s Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Ecuador&apos;s Jamil Mahuad \u2013 inept and corrupt heads of state that were also removed from office, but with less than fierce global support for their respective reinstatements (both men live quite comfortably in exile today). This might temper Zelaya&apos;s sense of entitlement and help him see the merit of scenarios that entail him standing down for the good and safety of his country. If some world leaders \u2013 perhaps Brazil&apos;s Lula \u2013 can shake some sense into Zelaya by threatening to temper international support, Zelaya could be forced to acquiesce to a brokered deal of immunity in return for a voluntary resignation. If he refuses, his only other option would be taking shelter within the Latin American left led by Venezuela&apos;s Hugo Chavez, a bloc which would make him a political martyr but likely be ineffective in retuning him to power, especially as the Honduran interim government seeks to run out the clock on Zelaya&apos;s remaining term in office.  We now know that a deal must be brokered, and that cooler heads must prevail. In order to curtail increased suffering and possible bloodshed, swift action towards a peaceful resolution is called for. Swift action this week, however, as opposed to last week, will now need to be coupled with more nuanced consideration of the problems and a focus on pragmatic solutions."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2009/jul/07/ie-security-flaw", "publicationDate": "2009-07-07T22:54:31Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Windows", "Data and computer security", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Today, McAfee reported a new variant appearing in queries from &quot;Korea, Japan, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan and the US in very small numbers&quot;."], "title": "Zero-day IE vulnerability hits China, and starts spreading", "article": "Microsoft has published a Security Advisory (972890) for an unpatched flaw in a Video ActiveX Control that was being exploited in China as long ago as June 11.

If you do get attacked, McAfee notes that the site attempts to compromise other applications -- &quot;Internet Explorer 6 and 7, DirectShow ActiveX, RealPlayer, Baidu Toolbar&quot;. The attackers simply want to download a Trojan, and they really don&apos;t care whether the vulnerability is in Microsoft&apos;s code or somebody else&apos;s. On the good side, if they had managed to install their Trojan, anti-virus software should have detected it. Also, McAfee and presumably other vendors have already added detection for the zero-day exploit. However, there&apos;s always a risk that other attackers will make better efforts to exploit vulnerable PCs, and do it over a much wider geographical area.

Google, the web upstart founded 11 years ago, has announced it will go head-to-head with Microsoft with an operating system (OS) \u2013 the programs that make a computer work \u2013 for machines ranging from handhelds up to desktop computers. If Google can get enough people to buy computers running its new Chrome OS, it will cut into Microsoft&apos;s two biggest cash cows: Windows and its Office suite of programs, including Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Microsoft, which once spoke of &quot;cutting off the air supply&quot; of a web-based rival, Netscape, has woken up to find a new threat reaching for its throat. The confrontation has been expected for years \u2013 despite Google&apos;s insistence it had no such ambitions \u2013 but it still caught observers by surprise when a Google spokeswoman confirmed to IT news service IDG that it plans to announce this week the names of computer makers in Taiwan and China signed up to work with Chrome OS, and said that it will show off Chrome&apos;s user interface later this year. The challenge to Microsoft is implicit, yet also direct. In a blog post, Sundar Pichai, Google&apos;s vice-president of product management, and Linus Upson, engineering director, explained that &quot;the operating systems that browsers [used to access pages on the web] run on were designed in an era when there was no web&quot;. That is a swipe at Windows, which dates back to the 1990s. Pichai and Upson also promise that with Chrome OS, &quot;we are going back to the basics and completely redesigning the underlying security architecture of the OS&quot; to ensure that &quot;users don&apos;t have to deal with viruses, malware and security updates&quot; \u2013 another swipe. An operating system is the set of programs that makes a computer act as it does: the same computer can run Windows, Apple&apos;s Mac OS X or the free Linux operating system. Each computer will then behave differently, and do different things; but connecting to the internet is key for all. So even if Google&apos;s dramatic attack fails, it still wins. The reason is its dominant position as a search engine \u2013 a key activity \u2013 and in selling adverts against search (&quot;AdWords&quot;) and web pages (&quot;AdSense&quot;), which is how it makes money. As Nick Carr, an author and journalist who has studied Google for books such as The Big Switch, observes: &quot;For Google, literally everything that happens on the internet complements its main business. The more things people and companies do online, the more ads they see and the more money Google makes.In addition, as internet activity increases, Google collects more data on consumers&apos; needs and behaviour and can tailor its ads more precisely, strengthening its competitive advantage and further increasing its income.&quot; Chrome OS will be based around the Linux operating system, and will initially be offered on &quot;netbooks&quot; \u2013 the small, cheap laptops that have seen explosive growth in the past two years due to their size, weight and price. Data from IDC suggests that while the PC market as a whole shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2009, netbook shipments kept growing (from a low base) to 9.5% of all computer shipments. If any significant share of the market moves to Chrome OS, Microsoft will lose the Windows revenue and revenue from its Office products, which won&apos;t run on Linux. That could slowly bleed the giant to death. Not everyone is convinced Google will succeed, however. Michael Gartenberg, a consumer devices analyst at Interpret, based in Los Angeles, was unimpressed. &quot;Folks who have never seen it, used it or spent five minutes with it are claiming it&apos;s huge threat to Windows.(If that&apos;s the case, wouldn&apos;t it also be a threat to Apple and Mac OS, an argument I&apos;ve not seen this morning?)&quot; He added that history doesn&apos;t run in favour of Chrome OS&apos;s principles: &quot;Consumers have overwhelmingly rejected Linux-flavoured netbooks for Windows-capable machines that they could actually accomplish things on, such as run PC applications.&quot; He thinks that the aim is to distract from Microsoft&apos;s next version of Windows,release of latest version of Windows 7, which will be released, due this October: &quot;By creating of lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt this morning (after all, every PC runs web-apps really well and no one is looking for devices that web based only for the most pat). they hope to take the attention and lustre off Windows 7.&quot; It may in fact be rival Apple that determines whether Chrome OS succeeds. Its iTunes music playing, organisation and purchasing program is installed on around 100m computers, more than half of which are Windows machines. If Google can persuade Apple to provide a version that runs on Linux, people may move over to Chrome OS. Otherwise, leaving behind their music collections the dearest digital property many of them own, might be too much. Still, Google has a good chance of getting a hearing: Eric Schmidt, its chief executive, has been on Apple&apos;s board since 2006. Perhaps Steve Ballmer, Microsoft&apos;s chief executive, should start worrying now."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2009/jul/09/bolivia-lithium", "publicationDate": "2009-07-09T15:30:00Z", "tags": ["Bolivia", "Electric, hybrid and low-emission cars", "Mining", "International trade", "US news", "World news", "Business", "Environment", "Technology", "Americas"], "sentences": ["Nations such as Taiwan leveraged their assets to attract foreign firms and learn from them."], "title": "The Li of Bolivia's land | Kevin Gallagher", "article": "Bolivia idles at a crossroads. The country has an unprecedented opportunity to use its newfound lithium deposits to bring itself out of poverty and in part save the planet from climate change. The trouble is, Bolivia can&apos;t fully do so without the help of foreign firms. Lithium is a mineral that currently serves as the battery for BlackBerrys and other electronics. The big hope for lithium is in the automobile industry \u2013 it is so light that electric cars running on lithium batteries can store more energy, emit less pollution, and drive longer distances. General Motors&apos; Volt, the new car GM hopes can rescue it from near bankruptcy, will deploy a lithium-ion battery with a petrol engine. Future models of Toyota&apos;s hybrid Prius intend to use lithium batteries as well. This is great news for Bolivia. According to the United States Geological Survey, 5.4 million tons of lithium could potentially be extracted in Bolivia&apos;s Salar de Uyuni region. Bolivia may lack the technological capacity to exploit this resource to its full long-term potential in an environmentally sound manner. Yet because the World Bank and US-based Bechtel corporation so horridly botched water privatisation in Bolivia, and the IMF recommended that Bolivia lift taxes from corporations and tax the poor, engaging with foreigners of any kind can be seen as complete blasphemy. Indeed on 14 June the head of Bolivia&apos;s mining agency told the Latin American Herald Tribune that the government may want to mine and manage lithium without foreign help. This is a marked change from the famous UN speech where President Morales said he would partner with foreign firms but that &quot;we want partners, not bosses&quot;. A bold negotiating stance would be for Bolivia to leverage foreign technological capabilities for mining lithium and for moving up the value chain. What if Bolivia demanded that foreign firms not only formed joint ventures for mining lithium, but foreign firms would also be required to form ventures: to bring battery makers and assembly plants and an automobile manufacturing plant or two; to establish research and development centres in Bolivia; to help build Bolivian infrastructure for exporting lithium, batteries, and cars; and to help train Bolivians to be engineers? What&apos;s more, such a deal would also require fair wages, labour rights, and environmental protection. Now that&apos;s a partnership. Similar deals were commonplace in East Asia during the second half of the 20th century. Nations such as Taiwan leveraged their assets to attract foreign firms and learn from them. In exchange for allowing foreign firms to come to these countries, foreign companies were required to form joint ventures with domestic firms, to locate research and development facilities that employed local engineers, source inputs from domestic firms, pay taxes, train the workforce, and more. Though tensions with Brazil over energy have been acute, Bolivia need look no further than the state-owned Petrobras as a Latin American success story in terms of leveraging foreign technology for local benefit. Petrobras serves as the lead co-ordinator of a web of foreign firms that helped Brazil acquire ultra-deep water drilling for oil. Brazil complements such efforts with policies to enable domestic producers and upstream technologies. Now Brazil is not only poised to be one of the world&apos;s biggest oil exporters but it has collaterally developed a biofuel industry and a flex-fuel engine that can take oil or biofuels \u2013 all through carefully targeted government policy. Mexico, on the other hand, provides an example of how to drive a great opportunity into the ground. It sat on huge oil deposits but hijacked its state-owned oil company Pemex for close to 100% of its profits to supply the government with close to 40% of its revenue. Unlike Brazil, Mexico doesn&apos;t allow the company to deploy Petrobras-like policies that learn from foreign firms. Now, Mexico has only nine years of proven oil reserves left and at this point if they wanted to be pro-active they would be shot down by Nafta. Given that the country has so much lithium, and that the world is looking for every opportunity to develop in a climate friendly manner, Bolivia has more leverage than most nations before it. Japan, with its hybrid and electric car technology, might make an interesting partner. If Bolivia chooses an East Asian or Brazilian path and partners with foreign firms it can accelerate sustainable economic development. Slamming the breaks on carefully thought out foreign partnerships may jam Bolivia&apos;s development prospects and steer the planet away from a cooler road."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/10/google-chrome-microsoft", "publicationDate": "2009-07-10T08:00:00Z", "tags": ["Google", "Microsoft", "Linux", "Technology", "World news"], "sentences": ["The most recent attempt to challenge Microsoft&apos;s monopoly was last year when the Taiwan-based Asus and others introduced so-called netbooks, small inexpensive machines geared to working on the internet rather than on the hard disk of your computer, the territory that Microsoft dominates."], "title": "Can Chrome steal Microsoft's shine? | Victor Keegan", "article": "Google and Microsoft, the two giants of the digital revolution, have been shadowboxing for years. Now the gloves are off. They will meet in hand-to-hand conflict in the area most vital to Microsoft: its Windows operating system that gives instructions to nearly 95% of the world&apos;s personal computers. Google announced yesterday that it would be shipping low cost computers next year with its own version of the open source Linux operating system, which is free but so far mainly used by geeks. Anyone who believes that competition is a force for good has got to welcome this move. Microsoft&apos;s near-95% monopoly is an extraordinary one. It extends not just to the operating system but also to the most lucrative programs that run on it, the Word word-processing package and the Excel spreadsheet. Why on earth should one company have a monopoly of all three of these key business products, none of which it invented? There are dozens if not hundreds of different mobile phones and computers yet only one globally successful spreadsheet and word-processor on which Microsoft spends billions of dollars protecting. Even though the company was found guilty of illegally maintaining a monopoly by judges appointed by the Bush administration, it does not seem to have made any difference, partly because Windows is so deeply embedded in the vast majority of computers in businesses. This means it is very expensive for companies to change systems and when employees want a computer for home use they naturally tend to buy a Windows machine because that is what they know and it will be compatible with software run on their office machines. This is bad for the economy because consumers are deprived of the choice and innovation that we enjoy elsewhere. If Microsoft didn&apos;t spend so much of its vast profits defending its monopolies think of the resources that would be released for other innovative purposes. The most recent attempt to challenge Microsoft&apos;s monopoly was last year when the Taiwan-based Asus and others introduced so-called netbooks, small inexpensive machines geared to working on the internet rather than on the hard disk of your computer, the territory that Microsoft dominates. Netbooks soon took the lion&apos;s share of the market in an area Microsoft had neglected. Microsoft retaliated with brutal efficiency quickly giving the likes of Asus offers they couldn&apos;t refuse. The result? Microsoft has established a 95% hold on netbooks and Asus has come on board evangelising for Windows. This is why Google&apos;s entry into the market is potentially so important. If, and it is a big if, Google can make its own &quot;Chrome&quot; version of Linux work efficiently in low-cost computers then it would act as a Trojan Horse in Microsoft&apos;s lucrative empire. Interestingly, Asus is one of the companies it has signed up. It doesn&apos;t follow that Google will succeed. This is partly because Microsoft is so deeply embedded in the corporate sector and will fight like a Tiger to defend its patch but also because not everything Google does turns to gold. Its Chrome browser has been only a modest success so far and its foray into virtual worlds with Lively had to be abandoned. Even on its own patch, search \u2013 where it is in danger of becoming a monopoly itself \u2013 it has not always been successful. In the field of real-time search (monitoring the here and now) it was upstaged by a tiny upstart Summize which was bought last year by Twitter and which can search Twitter messages (&quot;tweets&quot;) only 20 seconds after the sender has pressed carriage return. No one would be surprised if Google bought Twitter if it can&apos;t produce something similar itself. The potential of cheap laptops geared to storing emails, documents and videos, on the web is awesome partly because that is the way computing is going \u2013 unlike Windows which is mainly tethered to the desktop. But also because most people in the world can&apos;t afford a computer so the potential sales are truly huge even though many poorer people around the world don&apos;t yet have a broadband connection needed to maximise the benefit. If the arrival of a cheap, efficient Google netbook next year provides Microsoft with the competition it needs that will be all for the good. It is a big step from providing competition at the cheap end of the market to making an impact on Microsoft&apos;s corporate monopoly. But it is a start."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ethicallivingblog/2009/jul/09/plasticbags-waste-map", "publicationDate": "2009-07-10T09:34:53Z", "tags": ["Environment", "Waste", "Greenhouse gas emissions", "Ethical and green living"], "sentences": ["And if we are to take more radical action on them, which countries do you think are adopting the right approach: Ireland with its 15 Euro cents tax, Wales&apos;s plans for a 15 pence charge, Taiwan&apos;s ban on the distribution of free plastic bags, or somewhere else?"], "title": "Should we care about the UK's place in plastic bag league tables?", "article": "Britain lags behind the rest of the world on plastic bag bans and taxes, claimed the man who manufactured I Am Not a Plastic Bag this week.

The European Commission said today that it has sent a formal statement of objections to a number of companies alleging that they operated a price-fixing cartel. LCD panels are used in televisions, computer monitors and a range of smaller electronic gadgets including mobile phones and digital music players, and analysts said the ongoing investigation could lead to lower prices for consumers. The LCD market is worth an estimated $70bn (\u00a343bn) a year and is dominated by LG Display and Samsung, which together have about half the market for television and computer monitors. Dutch electronics group Philips set up LG Display with South Korea&apos;s LG Electronics a decade ago but has been selling out over the past few years and finally exited the joint venture in March. The commission did not reveal who had received its letter \u2013 part of an investigation launched three years ago \u2013 but Philips later admitted that it had been charged and it would &quot;vigorously oppose&quot; the allegations. LG added that it had also received the statement of objections, which it was reviewing. Samsung did not comment, while Sharp and Hitachi, also heavily involved in the LCD market, were unavailable. Other major LCD makers include Taiwan&apos;s AU Optronics (AUO), the country&apos;s largest LCD manufacturer and number three in the world, and Chi Mei Optoelectronics. Issuing a statement of objections is the first formal step in EU anti-competition investigations and the firms are allowed to respond to the objections. In other cartel cases, however, the EU has levied fines as high as 10% of turnover, which could run into hundreds of millions of pounds for LCD firms. In a separate case, LG Display pleaded guilty to price-fixing charges in the US last November after an investigation by the American competition authorities. Also pleading guilty at the time were Sharp, Hitachi and Taiwan&apos;s Chunghwa Picture Tubes. Together they paid some $600m in fines for fixing the price of screens sold to gadget manufacturers. That investigation followed scrutiny by the authorities in Japan and South Korea.

But there was concern among some of Sports Coach UK&apos;s partners that proper procedures had not been followed. Since then, partly at the behest of its main funders (Sport England and UK Sport), Philip Kimberley has been appointed interim chair to lead a wholesale review.

Its patron is the Princess Royal and its full-time chairman is Ian McGeechan, who took a 12-month sabbatical last October to lead the Lions tour of South Africa. It is hoped that by the time McGeechan is due back in October, Kimberley will have got to the bottom of the affair and put the organisation on a firmer footing. In an email to staff, Kimberley said one of his tasks would be to &quot;review the circumstances of the CEO and to make recommendations on the way forward&quot;. He will also conduct a wide-ranging review of the organisation&apos;s corporate governance, board membership and operational structure. Kimberley yesterday told Digger he could not comment on internal staffing issues but added: &quot;The challenge is to create a structure to take them through the next five to 10 years.&quot; Open has its limits The BBC yesterday moved to defend its decision not to air highlights of the Open from Turnberry.

The conviction of Dongfan &quot;Greg&quot; Chung marks a stepping up of US attempts to protect commercial and national security interests against overseas spies. After a 10-day trial in Santa Ana, California, the judge, acting without a jury, found Chung guilty of six counts of economic espionage, as well as acting as a foreign agent and making false statements to the FBI. Prosecutors presented evidence of contact between Chung and the Chinese aviation industry dating back to 1979, six years after he joined Rockwell International, an aerospace company taken over by Boeing in 1996. He was arrested in 2006 after federal agents searched his home and found more than 300,000 pages of documents relating to development of the space shuttle, the fuelling system for the Delta IV rocket, and several jewels in Boeing&apos;s crown including the F-15 fighter, B-52 bomber and Chinook helicopter. One letter found at his house dating from 1987 from a Chinese official said: &quot;It is your honour and China&apos;s fortune that you are able to realise your wish of dedicating yourselves to the services of your country.&quot; The judge, Cormac Carney, wrote in a 31-page verdict that &quot;the trust Boeing placed in Mr Chung to safeguard its proprietary and trade secret information obviously meant very little to Mr Chung. He cast it aside to serve the PRC [People&apos;s Republic of China], which he proudly proclaimed to be his &apos;motherland&apos;.&quot; The conviction highlights the peculiar nature of the US-Chinese relationship. On one hand, the US is increasingly dependent on Chinese loans to prop up a deficit which last week rose above $1 trillion (\u00a3612bn). On the other, US companies are increasingly concerned about Chinese commercial spying. As the world&apos;s engine room of research and development, the US is vulnerable to espionage, especially in the technology-rich aerospace and military industries, telecommunications, cars and pharmaceuticals. The Economic Espionage Act, passed in 1996, made spying on private companies a federal crime punishable by lengthy prison sentences and fines of up to $10m. At the time, Louis Freeh, then director of the FBI, warned that &quot;economic espionage is the greatest threat to our national security since the cold war&quot;. The 9/11 attacks changed the landscape of national security, pushing economic spying to the sidelines. But for US companies it remains a very real drain. Steven Fink, president of the corporate crisis management company Lexicon Communications and author of Sticky Fingers: Managing the Global Risk of Economic Espionage, said that all countries engage in such spying, but the Asian region was predominant, with China the main perpetrator. There had been prosecutions under the 1996 law, but the American legal system was &quot;woefully inadequate faced with the theft of trade secrets from American businesses&quot;. The Chinese government says it is also a victim of economic spies. As global economic strife puts businesses and governments under pressure, tit for tat accusations are starting to mount. In the latest case, Beijing has accused the Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto of bribery and arrested one Australian and three Chinese employees. Chung faces more than 90 years in prison when he is sentenced on 9 November, although the US government is expected to recommend the minimum sentence of up to 20 years. Chung, 73, was born in China and moved to Taiwan and then the US in 1962. He became a naturalised US citizen and spent 40 years working for Boeing and related companies.His high-level security clearance lasted from 1973 to 2002. The FBI became interested in him in 2006 after the arrest of Chi Mak, an engineer in L-3 Communications, a hi-tech surveillance equipment firm. Last year, Mak, who Chung had been using as a conduit to Chinese officials, was jailed for 24 years for passing on military secrets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jul/22/south-korea-brawl-parliament", "publicationDate": "2009-07-22T16:34:59Z", "tags": ["World news", "South Korea"], "sentences": ["In neighbouring Taiwan, legislators&apos; public battles have included wrestling, shoe-throwing, tie-pulling and the hurling of microphones, lunch boxes and books."], "title": "When parliament attacks: the world's greatest legislative brawls", "article": "     Politicians in South Korea were filmed today in the throes of a bizarre punchup in the National Assembly over a disputed media bill.

Popular books on Confucianism are bestsellers, and official discourse from the government often expresses traditional Confucian values such as harmony. What is less well known, however, is the resurgence in interest among academics in China. \u00a0 Rigorous experiments by psychologists such as Peng Kaiping and Wu Shali show that there are striking cognitive differences between Chinese and Americans, with Chinese more likely to use contextual and dialectical approaches to solving problems. Psychologists Huang Guangguo and Yang Zhongfang from Taiwan and Hongkong advocate the use of traditional Chinese ideas like the &quot;relationism&quot; (guanxizhuyi) and &quot;middle way&quot; (zhongyong zhi dao) for psychological research. Economists such as Shen Hong take the family as the relevant unit of economic analysis and try to measure the economic effect of such values as filial piety. Feminists such as Chan Sin Yee and Li Chengyang compare care ethics and Confucian-style empathy, particularity, and the family as a school of moral education. Theorists of medical ethics such as Fan Ruiping discuss the importance of family-based decision making in medical settings. Those working in the field of business ethics such as Huang Weidong research the influence of Confucian values on business practices in China. Political surveys by political scientists such as Shi Tianjian, Chu Yunhan and Zhang Youzong show that attachment to Confucian values has increased during the same period that China has modernized. Sociologists such as Kang Xiaoguang and Sebastien Billioud study the thousands of experiments in education and social living in China that are inspired by Confucian values. Theorists of international relations such as Yan Xuetong and Xu Jin look to pre-Qin thinkers like Mengzi and Xunzi for foreign policy ideas. And philosophers such as Jiang Qing, Chen Lai, Bai Tongdong, and Chen Ming draw upon the ideas of great Confucian thinkers of the past for thinking about social and political reform in China. Wang Richang discusses the Confucian foundations of government slogans like &quot;yi ren wei ben&quot; (&quot;the people as the foundation&quot;). But academics doing research on Confucianism often work within rigid disciplinary boundaries borrowed from western academia. At a recent conference, Traditional Values in a Modern Chinese Context: An Interdisciplinary Approach, held at Renmin University of China, we tried to break away from this pattern, with academics working on Confucian values from different displicines seeing what we could learn from each other. Chen Lai pointed to the complexity of measuring Confucian values, which would involve tracing their origin in classic texts, their historical development, as well as evidence of contemporary influence. But most participants still felt that the research was well worth doing, given the importance of Confucianism for understanding Chinese society and furthering social and political reform rooted in local conditions. As one might expect, there were important areas of disagreement. For one thing, the starting points were often different. The majority sympathised with Confucian values and openly admitted that they begin with normative standpoints, just as liberal thinkers try to promote liberal values. Some claimed that they are doing purely scientific work measuring Confucian values. And some do both: most notably, Kang Xiaoguang both promotes political Confucianism and studies its development in Chinese society. The participants also identified areas of study that could not be researched fruitfully from other perspectives. Philosophers like Jiang Qing pointed to values like tian (Heaven) and liangzhi (conscience) that could not be studied by the empirically-minded social sciences, and Confucian educators like Yang Ruqin argued that moral growth is long term and could not be measured in controlled laboratory studies. But the workshop also led to some fruitful proposals for cross-disciplinary research. The participants noted areas of weakness in their own disciplines that could be usefully addressed from other perspectives. Philosophers and historians could help to refine the questions posed in political attitude surveys. For example, the &quot;Confucian&quot; attitude measured by political scientists that children should blindly obey their parents should be made more conditional if the aim is to measure attachment to Confucian values rooted in classic texts. Philosophers might also suggest questions for research inspired by less well-known Confucian values, such as the idea that listening to different types of music or believing in different views of human nature have different moral consequences during the course of one&apos;s life. Social scientists, for their part, can help philosophers determine which Confucian values are most effective in contemporary society. For example, the claims that filial piety provides the psychological basis for extending morality to non-family members could be researched by means of longitudinal studies. Psychologists could also identify the key ages that best allow for the memorization of classical texts. Social scientists could also help to study whether morality normally improves with age and whether learning the Confucian classics really does make rulers more morally sensitive and politically effective. The findings of social scientists might also help Confucian philosophers to determine which Confucian values are particular to societies with a Confucian heritage and which ones might be universalised. For example, the finding that collectivist attitudes are more typical of Chinese subjects in experimental settings means that there will likely be resistance to promoting those values abroad (just as there would be resistance to promoting highly adversarial and interest-based politics in China). Yan Xuetong pointed out that Confucianism won&apos;t be taken seriously abroad unless it is practiced by political leaders at home. These research questions remain open. What is clear, however, is that academics need the freedom to discuss and publish their ideas and adequate funding to carry out research in order to pursue these questions in fruitful ways. Under the right conditions, China could well develop into a leading centre of global learning, with academics researching questions and values hitherto neglected in the west."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/27/china-taiwan-presidents-contact", "publicationDate": "2009-07-27T13:38:07Z", "tags": ["China", "World news", "Hu Jintao", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The presidents of Taiwan and China exchanged direct messages today for the first time in 60 years, in the latest sign of their thawing relations.", "Hu Jintao wrote to Taiwan&apos;s Ma Ying-jeou to mark the latter&apos;s election as chairman of the Nationalist party.", "Beijing still claims sovereignty over Taiwan, which has been self-ruled since Chiang Kai-shek fled there following his defeat in the civil war in 1949.", "&quot;We should continue efforts to consolidate peace in the Taiwan Strait and rebuild regional stability,&quot; Ma replied, adding that they should &quot;put aside disputes&quot;."], "title": "Chinese and Taiwanese presidents exchange first messages in 60 years", "article": "First came direct flights, then freight links, and now a single telegram.

This has produced a stream of smaller, faster and cheaper chips, advancing at an exponential rate. But Moore&apos;s law could soon come to an end. And not because, as frequently predicted, we&apos;ve run into insurmountable technical problems \u2013 but because chip factories cost too much to build. We have not got to that stage yet. Intel is spending $7bn (\u00a34.2bn) upgrading its seven US chip fabrication plants (AKA fabs), and last Friday, Global Foundries started building a new $4.2bn fab in Saratoga County, New York. It will not be in operation until 2012, but the semiconductor industry has to invest during recessions to be ready to supply boom markets. Not cheap as chips Global Foundries is one answer to the affordability problem. It&apos;s a spinoff from the chip giant AMD, which so far is its only customer. But it&apos;s also a collaborative investment that will serve as the focus for collaborative research and development. New York state put up a $1.2bn incentive package to encourage Global Foundries to bring 1,400 high-paying high-tech jobs to the region. The government of Abu Dhabi is also investing up to $6bn over the next five years, both in the new Fab 2 and AMD&apos;s current fab in Dresden. Global Foundries also has alliances with IBM \u2013 which has a $2.5bn chip plant nearby in East Fishkill, NY \u2013 and several other companies. &quot;We don&apos;t believe any more in a home-grown R&amp;D model,&quot; says a spokesman, Jon Carvill. Rather than just serving AMD, the new strategy is to target the 20 largest companies who need leading-edge chip technologies in high volumes. &quot;There&apos;s very little competition in that part of the market,&quot; says Carvill. &quot;For those customers today, there isn&apos;t any choice: there&apos;s only TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] that can meet their needs. We&apos;re going to offer an alternative.&quot; Carvill is confident the &quot;silicon foundry&quot; approach will enable AMD to keep on competing with Intel, the world&apos;s largest chip manufacturer, as circuitry shrinks from today&apos;s 45 nanometres (billionths of a metre) to 22nm and beyond. (The Intel 8088 chip, used in the IBM PC in 1982, had 3-micron \u2013 3,000nm \u2013 circuits.) However, the latest of many predictions of the death of Moore&apos;s law concerns the economics rather than the physics. Len Jelinek, chief analyst for semiconductor manufacturing at iSuppli, has predicted that when we reach 18nm, in 2014, the equipment will be so expensive that chip manufacturers won&apos;t be able to recover the fab costs. This isn&apos;t really a new idea either. Mike Mayberry, vice-president of Intel&apos;s research and manufacturing group, points out that Arthur Rock, one of Intel&apos;s early venture capital investors, came up with Rock&apos;s law \u2013 the cost of a chip fabrication plant doubles every four years. However, unlike Moore&apos;s law, Rock&apos;s law has not worked out well. In an article published by the IEEE, Philip Ross argued that fabs should have cost $5bn in the late 1990s, and $10bn in 2004. Global Foundries&apos; new fab may sound expensive at $4.2bn, but that&apos;s an order of magnitude less than $40bn. Which is not to say there aren&apos;t potential problems in the semiconductor world. Gartner Research&apos;s vice-president, Bob Johnson, points out that apart from Intel and Samsung, who can afford to build this sort of fab for themselves, most companies are likely to move to foundries. &quot;By allowing companies like AMD to share costs, the foundry model has addressed that [cost] issue very nicely. But with fewer fabs going up, the amount of chip-making equipment sold will not be as high as it was,&quot; he says. Watch out for wafers You can see why this would ring alarm bells at the companies that Jelinek is tracking. They&apos;re looking at diminishing sales of increasingly complex and expensive equipment \u2013 machines that can cost more than $20m each. Johnson also points out another reason for rising costs: &quot;When you start integrating features to create a chip that does more, it&apos;s not just fab costs, it&apos;s design costs. It can cost more than $50m for a complex chip, and a large proportion of that is software to run the darn thing. I don&apos;t think it will kill the rate of technology advance in the next few years. What it may mean is that the price reductions that people are used to seeing are going to level off a bit.&quot; One way round that problem would be to make chips on bigger discs, called wafers. And if the chip manufacturing industry moves from today&apos;s 30cm wafers to 45cm, that will require a huge investment in new equipment. However, Jelinek thinks that the move to 45cm could be put off until 2017 or even 2018. Of course, big fabs making chips on big wafers also need big markets: they&apos;re only cost-effective when they&apos;re running close to capacity. As Intel&apos;s Mayberry says: &quot;Bigger and inefficient isn&apos;t necessarily better, and if your products are boring, it doesn&apos;t matter how efficient your factory is.&quot; Splitting the Atom There&apos;s also the question of how many people really need the latest and greatest technology. Paul Jackson from the research company Forrester says Intel&apos;s biggest problem isn&apos;t producing the next generation of chips but that &quot;the Atom has done fantastically well&quot;. Sales of Atom-powered netbooks seem to show that, for many purposes, a smaller, cheaper and less powerful chip is good enough. Mayberry has doubts. &quot;I&apos;m also old enough to remember when people said the Intel 386 chip overshot the market because no one could type that fast,&quot; he grins. &quot;Then I got a copy of Microsoft Word, and you know, that was really slow! Today, for many tasks, it doesn&apos;t matter which computer I use, but for some tasks, even my quad-core processor is not as fast as I&apos;d like. There are uses that will continue to drive the need for more and more performance.&quot; Nonetheless, there will come a point when semiconductor manufacturing does approach a limit: when transistor gates are only a few nanometres long. Atoms and electrons are not getting any smaller. But the inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil has argued that the application of Moore&apos;s law is much wider than the semiconductor industry. He says: &quot;Moore&apos;s law was not the first, but the fifth paradigm to provide accelerating price-performance&quot;. The phenomenon can be applied to successive waves of machines built using valves, discrete transistors and microprocessors. In the future, something else may take over. Kurzweil reckons that the next stage is that chips will be built in three dimensions. This is something that Mayberry \u2013 whose job it is to make sure Intel has the technology to track Moore&apos;s law \u2013 is working on. But as he says, the future is uncertain. &quot;Whatever I predict today, 10 years from now, I&apos;ll be surprised: the world will be different. I&apos;m happy with that.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2009/jul/31/scotch-whisky-vintage-glenfiddich-50", "publicationDate": "2009-07-31T08:45:00Z", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Business", "Whisky"], "sentences": ["Most of my fellow sniffers and slurpers were from India, the USA, Taiwan, Russia and China, which Glenfiddich confirms are now their most important markets."], "title": "Can old whisky rejuvenate scotch?", "article": "The first smell is of citrus; grapefruit, to be exact. The next is a floral note that those more expert than I identify as rose petals, and finally there is a hint of green tobacco. It has a fresh, clean aroma that is matched by my first sip, which reveals more citrus, traces of soft vanilla, caramel and even a little smoke. It is easily the finest whisky I have ever tasted, but then it should be. The tiny amount of golden liquid I have been allowed to sample, which barely covers the bottom of a commemorative glass, would probably cost \u00a3500 in the unlikely event that I were ever to find it in a bar. If you want to buy a whole bottle of it, it&apos;s yours for a mere \u00a310,000.This whisky in question is The Glenfiddich 50 Year Old, an extremely limited release of 450 bottles which will be sold at the measly rate of 50 a year to those whose lives will not be complete without a bottle of scotch costing more than double the amount I have ever paid for a car. It is universally hailed by all present at the distillery, including some of the whisky world&apos;s most revered palates, as a hit, testament to the talents of Glenfiddich&apos;s master distiller David Stewart. It is also a brave statement by the brand leader in single malts at a time when many people&apos;s idea of luxury is stretching no further than a takeaway on more than one night of their staycation. Glenfiddich is one of the few distilleries that could even consider a launch of this nature. It&apos;s still a family owned company without the pressures of shareholders, and can consistently over-produce and store spirit for releases such as these. Many others produce and sell exactly to projection. This has led to shortages of certain vintages and the possible embarrassment of gaps in age statement portfolios as whisky is released to help hit turnover targets. However, the occasional worry of a spirit shortage is far from the largest problem facing Scottish whisky distillers at the moment. The fact that I was one of only a handful of UK writers to attend the launch is proof of the decline of the popularity of scotch in its native land. Most of my fellow sniffers and slurpers were from India, the USA, Taiwan, Russia and China, which Glenfiddich confirms are now their most important markets. In 2008 UK sales of vodka overtook blended scotch whisky for the first time, and while many in the industry dismiss this as a result of youthful palates seeking neutral spirits as a delivery system for alcohol, the truth is that scotch suffers from a serious image problem. It is seen by most as an old man&apos;s drink. Other spirits are winning the marketing battle, with tequila, rum and even gin brands gaining increasing numbers of followers with innovative marketing and the release of boutique bottlings. Perhaps even more alarming, if you&apos;re a Scottish distiller, is the growth of &apos;new world&apos; whiskies. Australian, Canadian and of course Japanese whiskies are of increasingly high quality, and distillers such as Nikka and Suntory are now consistently winning major international awards. Some may say the product is of little more than curiosity value at the moment, but the wine producers of France, Spain and Italy will tell you that a decision to ignore new world producers may become a matter of regret. Many distilleries are fighting back by releasing whiskies which, after being aged in the traditional bourbon or sherry barrels, are transferred for the last stage of maturation to barrels previously used for other spirits or even fine wines. Some are intriguing and others have provoked furious debate amongst enthusiasts. Once again, however, the whisky industry seems in danger of shooting itself in the foot. The proliferation of these different &quot;expressions&quot; causes even more confusion for the average punter who, faced with a bewildering and ill-communicated variety from which to choose, is tempted to ignore scotch altogether in favour of the less confusing spirits. Glenfiddich faces the same challenges as other distilleries, and releasing extravagant vintages may be regarded as an exercise in indulgence. Nevertheless, the release of The 50 Year Old also points a possible way forward for the rest of the industry.  For scotch whisky to survive in an increasingly challenging market, it should not scrabble after trends like a parent after boisterous children, but should concentrate on what makes it one of the finest things on the planet: excellence."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/china-russia-relationship", "publicationDate": "2009-08-01T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Russia", "China", "World news", "Europe", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["They include development, reunification with Taiwan and internal stability, which experts suggest is more of a priority than ever following last month&apos;s ethnic riots against Han Chinese in Xinjiang."], "title": "Russia fears embrace of giant eastern neighbour, China", "article": "It was an unashamed display of military force, involving tanks, fighter jets and more than 3,000 soldiers. Last week China and Russia held their biggest joint military exercises ever - their battalions streaking across the plateaus and shimmering plains of Shenyang province. The exercises come as Moscow and Beijing prepare to celebrate an important moment in history: 60 years of diplomatic relations. After long periods of frigidity during the cold war, the two countries now claim to be enjoying an unprecedented strategic partnership. But the military manoeuvres - named Peace Operation 2009 - were not just about showing off, unleashing rockets at imaginary terrorist enemies or threatening the US. Instead their aim was to send an unambiguous message to the internal Muslim populations of China and Russia: no dissent will be tolerated.  Both countries are now facing simmering Muslim uprisings. In China&apos;s case, this comes from Uighurs whose revolt in the north-west province of Xinjiang this summer has been brutally suppressed. Russia, meanwhile, is facing an insurgency of its own in the north Caucasus republics of Ingushetia, Chechnya and Dagestan. But while China and Russia have much in common, including a mutual fear of separatism and Islamic radicalism, there are also signal differences. Despite last week&apos;s exercises, and a visit to Russia by Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, in June, politicians in Moscow harbour a deep-seated fear of China - in particular, of Chinese encroachment. Russian TV recently claimed that Beijing has drawn up a secret plan. According to this top-secret blueprint, China is determined to grab back Russia&apos;s remote, but vast, far east region. China&apos;s strategy includes persuading migrants to settle in Russia, marry local women and steal or co-opt local businesses. Russia&apos;s far east has always been the most strategically vulnerable part of Moscow&apos;s fissiparous imperium, in what is the world&apos;s biggest country. Some 6,100km (3,800 miles) and an eight-hour flight from Moscow, the far east is home to just 6.5 million Russian citizens. Next door, across the Amur river in north-eastern China, there are 107 million Chinese. Given this demographic imbalance, there is a primordial fear in the Russian imagination that China will eventually try to steal back the Europe-sized far east of Russia - a region rich in mineral resources, trees, coal and fish. The salmon alone are an attractive target. A quarter of the world&apos;s Pacific salmon spawn in the volcanic Kamchatka peninsula. According to the Russian TV scenario, Beijing is furtively plotting to undo the Russian colonisation of the Pacific coastal region, started in the 18th century by tsarist-era adventurers. The area&apos;s original inhabitants were Chinese. These early nomads eked out a meagre living while dodging the tigers that still haunt the Sikhote-Alin mountains. In reality, the relationship is far more fascinating than the baseless fears of Russia&apos;s nationalists. Over the past decade the number of Chinese migrants working in Russia&apos;s far east has actually fallen. In Moscow, the authorities have recently shut down the capital&apos;s enormous Cherkizovsky market, turfing thousands of Chinese out of a job. The huge bazaar was home to Chinese traders selling billions of dollars-worth of grey-sector goods. (According to China&apos;s Xinhua agency, losses from Wenzhou in Zhejiang province alone amount to more than $800m, after Russian police confiscated their stocks.) Some 150 Chinese workers have been deported since the market was closed on 29 June. Most experts believe China&apos;s own strategic goals do not include Russia&apos;s far east, or primitive territorial expansion. Instead Beijing&apos;s priorities lie elsewhere. They include development, reunification with Taiwan and internal stability, which experts suggest is more of a priority than ever following last month&apos;s ethnic riots against Han Chinese in Xinjiang. According to Dr Bobo Lo, a lecturer on Chinese-Russian relations at the Centre for European Reform, Beijing&apos;s real challenge to Moscow is rather different. He argues that the rise of China will lead to the &quot;steady marginalisation of Russia from regional and global decision-making&quot;. The Chinese do not want to invade Russia militarily because, he points out, they would lose. Any loss of influence would alarm the Kremlin, which still sees itself as a major global power. Over the past nine years, under president and then prime minister Vladimir Putin, Russia has worked hard to recover its superpower status. However, few outside Moscow doubt that the main challenge to the United States&apos;s increasingly wobbly global and economic hegemony comes not from Putin&apos;s Moscow but Hu&apos;s Beijing. In the meantime, informal ties between China and Russia are blossoming. During the summer, after the ice encrusting the Amur river melts, Russian tourists are now travelling to China from the attractive Russian town of Khabarovsk. Their destination is the gleaming Chinese town of Fuyuan, reached by whizzy hydrofoil. Yesterday, cruising down the Amur, Captain Alexander Udenka pointed out to the Observer the border between China and Russia. On the river&apos;s right bank is China and a series of low green mountains and Fuyuan&apos;s newly built high-rises. Out on the river, Chinese fishermen zip around in speedboats, looking for the giant but elusive Amur sturgeon. Over on the left bank, meanwhile, is Russia. Here there is no sign of human activity. The sandy bays are empty. There are not even any watchtowers - merely a shimmering green embankment of dense willows and oaks, as well as Manchurian nut trees and Japanese cherries - all apparently further evidence of far eastern Russia&apos;s lack of people. &quot;In 1969 China and Russia fought a war over one of these river islands,&quot; Udenka explains, sitting in his captain&apos;s cabin and steering in the middle of the river. &quot;It was a small war. Now there are good relations between Russia and China. We trust each other,&quot; he adds, in broken Chinese. A decade ago Fuyuan was little more than a village with a few pigs. Now it is a brash town, offering goods at less than half the price in Russia. During the season several hundred Russian tourists visit every day, staying on cheap two-day packages, and haggling with Chinese locals who have rapidly mastered the Russian language. Everything conceivable is on sale in Fuyuan - fur coats, computers, mobile telephones, socks and even sex toys. After trudging round the market for several hours, most Russians relax with a massage - \u00a310 for a one-hour session - or get their hair highlighted. Others tuck into a tasty lunch of silver carp caught from the Amur, or pork dumplings. &quot;I still haven&apos;t managed to get the hang of chopsticks,&quot; Igor, a 23-year-old Russian tourist confessed to the Observer. Igor showed off his new purchases - a black cowboy hat, a fake Armani jacket, Gillette Mach 3 razors and a bottle of aftershave with an English logo, &quot;Love Affairs&quot;. Asked why he had decided to buy a cowboy hat, Igor replied: &quot;I got drunk last night.&quot; Local Russians can travel to Fuyuan without a visa. This suits Fuyuan&apos;s traders, many of whom have moved from elsewhere in China. &quot;I like Russians. They are pretty indiscriminate. They just grab everything and run,&quot; said Li Wing, 42, who owns a sex shop in Fuyuan.  Fuyuan ends abruptly. Its shopping centre peters out at a decorative Chinese gate. From here, there is a stunning view of the Amur river and Russia. Up in the woods, among the pine trees, there is evidence of the environmental cost that new Chinese towns such as Fuyuan are wreaking: heaps of rubbish, plastic bags and a dead owl. The problem of what to do with the far east has long exercised Moscow&apos;s leadership. The Soviet Union offered generous subsidies to cajole workers and young couples to start a new life here. They got higher salaries, career opportunities, and flats. There were also cheap air fares back to European Russia. The incentives were needed given the region&apos;s harsh climate - scorching summers and freezing winters, with January temperatures regularly falling below -30C. However, after the demise of the Soviet Union this system collapsed. With a ticket to Moscow now costing \u00a3500 return, a new generation has grown up with weaker ties to the capital. Instead of visiting St Petersburg, local Russians are more likely to holiday in China - travelling by bus to the Chinese seaside resort of Dalian and other destinations in China&apos;s north east. Gradually, Asiatic Russians are getting to know their neighbours better. Farther down the Amur in the border town of Blagoveshchensk, Russian pensioners have even started buying up apartments on the Chinese side of the river. Other young Russians head west: since the early 1990s the Russian far east&apos;s population has plunged by 1.6 million. This exodus is a source of increasing worry for the Kremlin. On Friday Putin travelled to Khabarovsk to unveil a new pipeline stretching from the Russian island of Sakhalin to Khabarovsk and the far eastern port of Vladivostok. The pipeline will take gas to China, Japan and South Korea - part of an attempt to stimulate the region&apos;s economy. In June, during his trip to Russia, Hu attended a summit of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation, and held talks in Moscow with Russia&apos;s president, Dmitry Medvedev, which led to the signing of a massive oil deal. He also had tea with Putin. The deal reinforced China&apos;s growing economic influence in the region, and its emergence as a competitor with Russia for Central Asia&apos;s energy reserves. In Khabarovsk, meanwhile, few locals see much prospect of the far east breaking away from Moscow. Despite improved understanding between China and Russia, the cultures remain too different. (The Chinese see the Russians as western-centric.) In Khabarovsk, the last stop on the Trans-Siberian Railway before Vladivostok, nobody is talking about secessionism. &quot;I&apos;ve had a few relationships with Russian girls. But I&apos;ll end up marrying a Chinese one,&quot; says Tsi Ke, 25, who has lived for the past decade in Khabarovsk. Tsi owns a thriving Chinese restaurant, where blonde Russian waitresses wear Chinese dresses. He adds: &quot;In China we believe a wife should stay at home a lot and be like a daughter to your own parents. For us, marriage isn&apos;t just between two people but between two families.&quot; A more pressing problem for the Kremlin is the growing estrangement between Russia&apos;s western and eastern halves. Resentment of Moscow and its far-away bureaucrats is rising. There have been grassroots protests in Khabarovsk and in Vladivostok after Moscow raised duties on second-hand Japanese cars late last year, killing off a major regional business. Anti-Kremlin protests are continuing. In May, Medvedev dropped into Khabarovsk for an EU-Russia summit. (The venue - 10 hours&apos; flight from Brussels - was apparently chosen by Russia to punish the EU&apos;s pampered representatives, several of whom fell asleep during sessions). Medvedev flatteringly described the far east as his &quot;favourite part&quot; of Russia, and expressed sympathy with students too broke to travel to Moscow. This summer the Kremlin has introduced a scheme offering some discounted tickets to the under-23s. It remains to be seen whether the scheme will make much difference. In reality, though, successive governments in Moscow have done little to develop the far east - making the region susceptible to civic unrest and discontent. The region suffers from &quot;long-term neglect by Moscow&quot; and &quot;appalling corruption and misgovernment at regional level&quot;, Bobo Lo says. Despite last week&apos;s show of unity during military manoeuvres, the relationship between Beijing and Moscow is no longer one of equals. Russia may see China as an important strategic counterweight to the US - with whom it is currently in conflict over a range of issues, including the planned US missile defence shield in central Europe. But the Chinese know that it is they, and not Putin&apos;s Russia, who are destined to become the world&apos;s newest superpower. And according to Bobo Lo, China is not interested in allowing strategic accommodation with Moscow to disrupt Beijing&apos;s more important partnership with Washington. &quot;Washington is still the world&apos;s only indispensable partner,&quot; he notes. A history of tension \u2022 Throughout much of the cold war Beijing and Moscow were enemies. However, Stalin had encouraged and financed Mao Zedong&apos;s revolution, recognising his communist People&apos;s Republic in October 1949. The partnership survived Stalin&apos;s death and the early Khrushchev years. \u2022 In 1959 the two countries squabbled over which should lead the world communist movement, an ideological quarrel replicated in communist parties across Asia and Africa. Khrushchev&apos;s decision to back down during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis also needled Mao. \u2022 In March 1969 tensions exploded when Russia and China fought a brief war in Russia&apos;s far east over the disputed Damansky island (now known as Zhenbao), close to Khabarovsk. \u2022 Tensions continued in the 1970s and 1980s, especially after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, pictured above. D\u00e9tente only became possible after the Soviet Union&apos;s demise. \u2022 Over the past two decades relations between Beijing and the Russian Federation have improved, with booming trade, agreement on many international issues, and growing military co-operation. In 2004 Russia settled a long-running border dispute with China, handing over Tarabarov island in the Amur river, and half of another large island, Bolshoy Ussuriysky. \u2022 China&apos;s rise, however, is likely to place increasing strain on the relationship. Experts believe that, as China becomes a world superpower, Russia&apos;s influence will diminish - a fate the Kremlin is unlikely to accept."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/03/china-film-festival-hack", "publicationDate": "2009-08-03T10:32:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Censorship", "Internet", "Rebiya Kadeer", "Hacking", "Film", "Xinjiang", "Australia news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["To date, all seven Chinese films originally slated for screening, including those produced in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have withdrawn."], "title": "Not everyone is Melburnian | Jeremy Goldkorn", "article": "On 15 July, the Guardian reported that a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Chinese consulate in Melbourne called the organiser of the Melbourne International Film Festival and &quot;demanded a documentary about exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer be dropped&quot; from the programme. Rebiya Kadeer is considered an enemy of the state by the Chinese government and is blamed for organising the riots that killed 197 people according to the official death toll. Shortly after the phonecall from the consulate, Chinese filmmakers including art house cinema darling Jia Zhangke began to withdraw their films for the festival, citing the Rebiya Kadeer documentary as the reason. To date, all seven Chinese films originally slated for screening, including those produced in Hong Kong and Taiwan, have withdrawn. On 25 July, the film festival&apos;s website was hacked, its content replaced with a Chinese flag and anti-Kadeer slogans. Many of the reports about the hack assumed that the action was planned by the Chinese government. A typical example: on The New Yorker&apos;s blog, Richard Brody wrote a post called We are all Melbournian in which he says that &quot;the hack attack should be understood as the tacit work of the Chinese government&quot;. This assumption is widespread, despite a story by Mary-Anne Toy in Australia&apos;s Sunday Age newspaper in which the hacker in question is quoted denying that he acted on behalf of the Chinese government. It seems many westerners cannot believe that Chinese people would engage in such pro-government activities unless the government ordered them to do so. This is a fundamental misunderstanding about what I think is the biggest and most emotional difference in thinking between the average westerner and the average Chinese person: attitudes towards Chinese policy in Tibet and Xinjiang. I first became aware of it in 1997. I had been in China two years and was planning a trip to Tibet. When a normally mild-mannered and apolitical Chinese friend of mine heard of my plans, he got agitated and gave me a lecture about how Tibet is and always was a part of China. More than 10 years after that lecture, China is a much more open and in some ways westernised place than it was, but that has not changed the attitudes of most Chinese people when it comes to their country&apos;s right to rule Tibet and Xinjiang. The hacker who vandalised the Melbourne Film Festival website shows an attitude typical of China&apos;s urban youth. I tracked him down (not hard \u2013 his net handle &quot;laojun&quot; is the same as the name he left on the hacked website) and asked him why he hacked the site and if the government has anything to do with it. Laojun said that it&apos;s &quot;completely normal for a Chinese person to have a patriotic heart&quot; and that the government had absolutely nothing to do with his actions: &quot;On the contrary, I am worried the government will punish me for this.&quot; He also noted that he has received many messages of support from fellow Chinese internet users who have added him to their instant messaging contact list or written supportive messages on various internet forums that have discussed the hack. This morning a new poll on the Kaixin social networking site, a Facebook clone that is currently the most popular networking site for upwardly mobile Chinese urbanites (among the country&apos;s most cosmopolitan citizens) asked users if they supported the hack. Only two answers were possible: &quot;support&quot; and &quot;super support&quot;. Around 1,000 people have voted support, and 10 times that number voted &quot;super support&quot;. Other Chinese forum websites with posts about the hack have also drawn overwhelmingly positive comments. Supporters also include the users of anti-CNN.com, a website started by a young man in Beijing around the time of the Tibet riots last year with the aim of revealing western media bias in their China reporting. These people are not government workers and they know that they see a censored internet inside China. I asked Laojun himself what he thought of China&apos;s internet censorship programme, usually called the GFW or &quot;great firewall&quot; in China: &quot;To tell you the truth, I don&apos;t really like it, I don&apos;t really approve of it \u2026 But for me it does not really perform a function. I have a lot of ways to get around it and I sometimes go outside to look at foreigners&apos; opinions about China. But perhaps for the government, the GFW helps to protect China&apos;s interests.&quot; You may disagree with Laojun&apos;s views on Xinjiang or censorship. You may blame his thinking and the support of his fans on state propaganda or the educational system. But a large \u2013 I would daresay majority \u2013 of the population of China do not feel that they are Melbournian at all but red-blooded, patriotic Chinese people."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/03/uk-rail-manufacturing-success", "publicationDate": "2009-08-03T17:40:16Z", "tags": ["Manufacturing sector", "Rail transport", "China", "Business", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The British arm of the German company, which makes components for both overground and underground trains, saw its profits rise to almost \u00a366m in 2008, up from \u00a345m the previous year on the back of exports to China, Taiwan, Dubai and Saudi Arabia."], "title": "UK train parts maker working round the clock", "article": "Staff at Knorr-Bremse Rail Systems are working triple shifts as the manufacturer of train brakes and platform screen doors is thriving in spite of the recession.

While mainland authorities have become practised in preparing for the typhoon season, the chaotic weather can disrupt business, fishing and shipping across the export-driven region. Authorities in Fujian called 48,000 boats back to harbour, and in the provincial capital, Fuzhou, people were rushing to supermarkets for necessities before the typhoon arrived, according to Xinhua. In Zhejiang, around 35,440 ships were called back from sea. Flights from Fuzhou and Xiamen were cancelled. At least one cargo ship was stranded after the strong winds and waves pushed it into shallow waters. Further up the coast, Shanghai was on &quot;high alert&quot; and dozens of cargo ships in the area delayed or cancelled voyages, with forecasters warning of torrential downpours and waves at sea up to seven metres or higher, Xinhua said. Morakot hit Taiwan late on Friday, tearing across the island yesterday and dumping more than 200cm (80 inches) of rain on some southern counties. Taiwan&apos;s Disaster Relief Centre said a woman was killed when her vehicle plunged into a ditch in Kaohsiung county in heavy rain on Friday, and two men drowned in Pingtung and Tainan respectively. It said 31 people were missing and feared dead. It said flash flooding had washed away a makeshift home in southern Kaohsiung, leaving 16 people missing. Three were swept away in south-eastern Taitung county, including two policemen who were helping to evacuate villagers. Twelve others were missing, including three fishermen from a capsized boat and three people whose cars fell into a rain-swollen river, it said. In southern Pingtung county, 4,000 people were stranded in inundated villages waiting for police boats to rescue them, news media reported. In Taitung, a six-storey hotel collapsed and plunged into a river after floodwaters eroded its base. All 300 people in the hotel were evacuated and uninjured, officials said. In the northern Philippines, the typhoon and lingering monsoon rains left 21 people dead and seven others missing in landslides and floodwaters, including three European tourists who were swept away on Thursday, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. The bodies of a Belgian and two French citizens were found on Friday. More than 83,000 people in 93 northern villages were affected by floods and landslides, including 22,200 who fled their homes, the council said. Rescue helicopters and ships were still searching for about 10 Chinese crew whose ships were caught in tropical storm Goni, which made landfall in Guangdong on Wednesday and swept the coastal areas of Hainan on Thursday and Friday, before weakening to a tropical depression. Typhoons regularly hit China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan in the second half of the year, gathering strength from the warm waters of the Pacific Ocean or South China Sea before weakening over land. Most casualties tend to be in mountainous regions prone to landslides and flash floods."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/typhoon-morakot-china-taiwan-etau", "publicationDate": "2009-08-10T08:23:04Z", "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "China", "Japan", "Philippines", "World news", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["     At least 34 people have died and millions of others been affected in the Asia-Pacific region after a typhoon and a tropical storm battered China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan.", "Morakot claimed the lives of 11 people in the Philippines and another 12 in Taiwan, where 52 people remain missing.", "Even the floor got pushed up by the water.&quot; Parts of Taiwan saw the worst flooding for half a century.", "The typhoon dumped 2.5 metres of rain on the island, causing at least 3.4bn Taiwan dollars (\u00a362m) in agricultural damage."], "title": "Deadly typhoon Morakot and tropical storm Etau pummel east Asia", "article": "     At least 34 people have died and millions of others been affected in the Asia-Pacific region after a typhoon and a tropical storm battered China, Taiwan, the Philippines and Japan.

There is no shortage of suggestions. The problem, activists and campaigners say, lies in securing broad-based international support for substantive action and sustaining it when attention shifts elsewhere. To date, such collective determination has been almost wholly lacking. The EU, the US and other countries maintain limited sanctions on the generals. Britain has shown a diplomatic lead in trying to pressure the junta, with the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and his wife, Sarah Brown, taking a personal interest. In May the UN security council went further than before, demanding the immediate release of all 2,100 Burmese political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and calling for a &quot;genuine&quot; national dialogue. But today&apos;s predictable chorus of western condemnation was not matched by similar levels of concern in China, India and Thailand, Burma&apos;s neighbours, main trading partners and the countries with most leverage. By commuting Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s sentence, the junta evidently hopes these key partners, and the Association of South-East Asian Nations, will applaud its supposed leniency and deem no further action necessary. As current president of the security council, Britain has a chance to stop that happening. Speaking after what he called a &quot;monstrous&quot; verdict, Brown pointed to strengthened EU sanctions targeting the junta&apos;s economic interests. &quot;The international community must take action,&quot; he went on. &quot;I believe that the UN security council, whose will has been flouted, must now respond resolutely and impose a worldwide ban on the sale of arms to the regime.&quot; In pushing for UN action Britain will have the support of permanent council member France, which called today for new measures against Burmese timber, gems and other resource exports. But China and Russia will be less co-operative. They are committed, where its suits them (though not in Taiwan or Georgia), to the principle of non-interference in nations&apos; sovereign affairs. And they will try to safeguard their Burmese commercial interests, not least arms sales. Another difficulty, less expected, concerns the US administration&apos;s uncertain direction. A policy review has been under way since January, as yet with no clear decision about whether to engage, contain, or confront the regime. Barack Obama condemned Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s trial as a &quot;sham&quot;. Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, last month offered the junta a pathway to normalised relations if it took &quot;essential steps&quot; such as allowing free elections next year. But Clinton exhibited much more concern about reports that North Korea was supplying nuclear weapons technology to Burma. She even ordered US diplomats to talk to the junta about ensuring Burmese compliance with UN sanctions on Pyongyang. Perhaps the dire prospect of a nuclear-armed junta may be the only way to galvanise the international community into effective action. But that thought worries Burma activists. &quot;We are concerned that if reports about Burma&apos;s nuclear ambitions are confirmed, the focus of the international community will switch to disarming the dictatorship, not removing it, and human rights and democratisation will take second place,&quot; said Mark Farmaner, director of Burma Campaign UK. This would repeat the mistake made in North Korea where &quot;the focus was effectively bribing the regime to give up nuclear weapons while ignoring human rights&quot;. Campaigners and human rights groups also worry that the attention paid to Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s plight, while welcome, has diverted attention from the plight of the Burmese people as a whole, who remain subject to systemic abuses including ongoing attacks on ethnic groups, rape, torture, extra-judicial killing, slave and child labour, arbitrary imprisonment and the blocking of international aid. &quot;We cannot have a situation where the generals are let off the hook because they returned Suu Kyi to house arrest ... and at the same time teenage girls in Karen state are being gang-raped by Burmese army soldiers,&quot; Farmaner said. To answer the question of what to do about Burma, Obama should join forces with Brown at the UN, where the US takes over the security council presidency from Britain next month, and seek a formal UN commission of inquiry into crimes against humanity in Burma, Ko Bo Kyi, a former political prisoner and founder of the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, told the Far Eastern Economic Review. This could in theory lead to the generals themselves being put on trial. &quot;The international community remains divided on how best to deal with Burma. The regime depends on this. Ultimately the divisions help maintain the status quo and ensure their continued rule.&quot; Yet a united front was essential, he said, or else thousands of innocents &quot;who urgently need protection from the junta&apos;s brutality will suffer the consequences&quot;."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/11/taiwan-mudslides-typhoon-morakot", "publicationDate": "2009-08-11T18:24:14Z", "tags": ["Natural disasters and extreme weather", "Taiwan", "China", "Japan", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The first witness accounts of the terrifying moment when a mudslide buried a Taiwanese village have emerged, as rescuers warned that more than 700 people were trapped and had possibly died in the incident caused by typhoon Morakot.", "One villager told Taiwan&apos;s China Times newspaper that she fled with her husband and baby minutes before their home was buried.", "More than 100 people across the Asia-Pacific region, including 62 in Taiwan, have been confirmed dead since the typhoon hit the Philippines, Taiwan and China and tropical storm Etau pummelled Japan, where it claimed 13 lives.", "Hu Jui-chou, a Taiwanese army major-general involved in rescue operations, said the 700 or more still trapped included residents trapped by a massive landslide in Hsiao-lin and a second village, Namahsia, in Kaohsiung.", "&quot;Almost every house was gone, except for a couple.&quot; One rescued resident, Lin Mei-ying, begged the military to step up efforts, telling the television station ETTV: &quot;There are still a lot of people trapped inside ... please go faster so they can be saved.&quot; According to Taiwanese television reports, a mudslide may have buried another village in Pingtung county.", "Earlier today Taiwan&apos;s fire service reported that tens of thousands were stranded."], "title": "Search continues as 700 feared dead in Taiwan typhoon mudslide", "article": "The first witness accounts of the terrifying moment when a mudslide buried a Taiwanese village have emerged, as rescuers warned that more than 700 people were trapped and had possibly died in the incident caused by typhoon Morakot.

Hui Liangyu, the vice-president, warned that big floods were still likely as heavy rain continued and more than 20 rivers reported water levels above flood-alarm lines in Zhejiang, Fujian and Anhui provinces, although Morakot has now been downgraded to a tropical storm. In Japan, Etau approached the island&apos;s central area and Tokyo, hours after a 6.5 magnitude earthquake tossed food and bottles from store shelves, disrupted transport and shut down a nuclear power plant for safety checks.

Beaming power to devices across several feet of empty airspace \u2013 which seems to be one of MIT&apos;s pet projects \u2013 looks a bit further away from commercial realisation. Wireless charging has been a sci-fi dream for several years without looking like making an impact on everyday life. But times are changing. The Wireless Power Consortium has just released version 0.95 of its standard spec for review, and it&apos;s planning to host some interoperability testing at its next meeting in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, next month. Perhaps even more importantly, the WPC has announced a logo: Qi, pronounced &quot;chi&quot;. It means &quot;energy flow&quot;, though perhaps not in quite the same sense as it&apos;s used in The Analects of Confucius. The WPC is following the strategy made famous by the Wi-Fi Alliance. For about two decades there were lots of incompatible wireless networking systems, often sold under confusing names. Eventually, a group of manufacturers got together to sell IEEE 802.11a/b with a consumer-friendly name. They agreed on a logo, had some &quot;plug fests&quot; to ensure their products worked together, and Wi-Fi swept the world. Whether Qi will be as successful remains to be seen. However, the backers include Duracell, Fulton Innovation (which developed the eCoupled system), Olympus, Philips, Samsung, ST-Ericsson and Texas Instruments. Between them, they cover a fair chunk of the global consumer marketplace. Products range from the Palm Touchstone charging dock to the wonderful-sounding Electronic Warm Shoes from Fu Da Tong Technology in Taiwan. There is also a clutch of gadgets from Philips \u2013 also based in Eindhoven. Take your pick from LED candles, the eSpring water treatment system, a Sonicare toothbrush, and his-and-hers Dual Sensual Massagers . There are also products you will find on the market that are not compatible with the draft standard, which is why training consumers to look for the Qi logo could be vital to the WPC&apos;s prospects of success. And Qi&apos;s prospects seem quite good. Consumers are certainly not in love with chargers for mobile phones, MP3 players, digital cameras and similar gadgets. Almost all today&apos;s devices seem to come with their own charger, and it almost never fits anything else. The idea of replacing chargers with pads that can recharge multiple gadgets wirelessly is therefore attractive.

All it took was a taxpayer-funded $103,000 trip over New Year&apos;s 2008 to the Great Barrier Reef, where a dozen of them and their spouses could see up close the dangers of global warming. Oh, and they did some diving and snorkeling on the side, to see the effects tourism was having on the coral reefs of course. A similar trip last summer to study climate change sent US lawmakers to the Galapagos Islands. It&apos;s a tough job, but somebody has to do it. Luckily, Congress just awarded themselves millions of dollars to upgrade their luxury jets so they can travel in first-class comfort. After a mild public outcry, Congress scaled back their $550m request to just $220m to buy four new luxury jets \u2013 a Gulfstream aircraft and three Boeings \u2013 which was what the Pentagon requested in the first place. Our overworked representatives in Washington have been racking up the frequent flier miles abroad lately with gusto. Travel expenditures by Congress last year totalled $13m, a tenfold jump since 1995, according to the Wall Street Journal. As lawmakers settle into their month-long recess, they are fond of repeating how they are working tirelessly until their agenda is completed. &quot;We won&apos;t rest until everybody who wants to work can find a job,&quot; said President Barack Obama, before heading to Martha&apos;s Vineyard for a family vacation next week. Senator John Kerry recently told a Council on Foreign Relations talk on climate change moderated by Tom Brokaw: &quot;Tom and I and many others are working \u2013 I&apos;ll tell you, I&apos;m working as hard as I&apos;ve ever worked in 25 years I&apos;ve been in the Senate on this issue.&quot; Both senator and moderator had perfectly bronzed tans. This hard-work ethos is played up even more when lawmakers venture abroad, which is why they often bring their spouses along. As a spokesman for representative Charlie Melancon of Louisiana told reporters after the trip to Australia, his wife Peachy offered &quot;insight and perspective&quot; that &quot;only amplified the educational benefit he gained as a lawmaker&quot;. Right. I guess Mark Sanford could use a similar logic to explain his trade missions to Argentina. There is, of course, nothing wrong with lawmakers travelling overseas. They get out of their bubble, build important relationships abroad and gain a broader perspective about the world. They also shore up their foreign policy credentials. Come campaign time, a picture with an Afghan tribal sheik or Nelson Mandela makes for a good photo-op. And sometimes they can accomplish some good in the world. Senator Jim Webb&apos;s trip to Burma resulted in the release of an American hostage there. But Webb&apos;s trip was the exception, not the norm. Most often these junkets are a waste of jet fuel, taxpayers&apos; money and lawmakers&apos; time. Snorkeling off the coast of Australia is only the tip of the iceberg. When I was in Istanbul recently, a friend of mine in the foreign service rolled her eyes over the amount of prep work she did to set up a shopping trip for US lawmakers&apos; wives. Then there was former Alaskan senator Ted Stevens&apos;s famous June 2007 outing to the Paris Air Show (price to taxpayers: $121,000) to learn about \u2013 this is true \u2013 developments in aviation. During this August recess, representative Keith Ellison is travelling to Kenya, senator Richard Shelby is hitting Europe with his wife and representative Nick Rahall is cruising the Pacific&apos;s Northern Mariana Islands. All of the above is being funded by US taxpayers. Besides the inherent hypocrisy \u2013 why are the automakers&apos; corporate jets so offensive but not Congress&apos;? \u2013 the fact is these trips hardly provide accurate snapshots of the world. Lawmakers rarely leave the comforts of their five-star hotels. They sit through scripted meetings with carefully vetted local leaders. And they leave with actually misinformed views of the local situation. Plus, it opens up the door for high-profile lawmakers to muddle the signals and step on the White House message when it comes to foreign policy. Nancy Pelosi&apos;s April 2007 trip to Syria was criticised for such reasons, as was Newt Gingrich&apos;s 1997 trip to China, in which he hinted that Washington would come to Taiwan&apos;s defence were war to break out, causing headaches for the Clinton administration. But the bigger concern is that lawmakers are just goofing off or working on their tans. With our government running up deficits and facing more pressing issues at home, there seems scant need to send lawmakers on safari tours in Africa or golfing excursions in Bermuda. Let&apos;s upgrade our commercial airplanes before sprucing up our reps&apos; luxury jets. To save the planet, our lawmakers do not need to have seen all corners of it first."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2009/aug/24/bovishomesgroup", "publicationDate": "2009-08-24T06:47:38Z", "tags": ["Bovis Homes", "Business"], "sentences": ["Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng was up 1.94% at 20589.97 and Taiwan&apos;s stockmarket rose 2.76% to 6838.25."], "title": "Market Forces breaking news: Asia roars ahead and FTSE to open higher", "article": "Asian stocks roared ahead today on fresh hopes of a global recovery, and the London stockmarket is also expected to open higher, possibly breaking through the 4900 level.

He added that the visit had been approved &quot;for humanitarian and religious considerations \u2026 and we believe it will not harm cross-strait relations.&quot; The government information office said that the president&apos;s office and national security officials met for five hours last night before agreeing to permit a visit. Hsu Yung-ming, a political science professor at Soochow University, said admitting the Dalai Lama would allow Ma to show he was not only concerned about ties with Beijing. &quot;He doesn&apos;t want people to think he cares only about China, [but] that he also cares about Taiwan,&quot; Hsu said. The spiritual leader has accepted the invitation &quot;in principle,&quot; his spokesman Tenzin Takhla said from Dharamsala, India, where the Tibetan government-in-exile is based. Taiwan has a sizable Tibetan community and the Dalai Lama has visited the island three times in the past 12 years, drawing crowds of tens of thousands, although his last trip was eight years ago. But Beijing usually objects strongly when the Dalai Lama travels away from his base in India. Earlier this year, officials demanded that Paris &quot;stop interfering in China&apos;s internal affairs&quot; when the mayor gave him honorary citizenship. According to Xinhua&apos;s statement, the spokesman for the Taiwan affairs office said the Dalai Lama was &quot;not a pure religious figure&quot;, adding: &quot;Under the pretext of religion, he has all along been engaged in separatist activities.&quot; The spiritual leader denies the claim, saying he seeks meaningful autonomy for Tibet rather than a separate state. Separately, Taiwan&apos;s parliament approved a special reconstruction budget of up to T$120bn (\u00a32.25bn) to cope with damage caused by the typhoon. Morakot brought the worst floods seen in the south of the island for half a century and caused mudslides that buried hundreds of villagers. Analysts said the finance ministry could raise the money through loans or by issuing bills and bonds."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/30/telecoms-apple", "publicationDate": "2009-08-29T23:01:00Z", "tags": ["Telecommunications industry", "Business", "Apple", "iPhone", "Mobile phones"], "sentences": ["The first Android phone, the G1 made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC, was launched late last year by T-Mobile."], "title": "Apple iPhone faces Android threat", "article": "The battle to dent the dominance of Apple&apos;s iPhone will intensify next month.

T-Mobile, meanwhile, has secured the rights to sell the first Android device from China&apos;s Huawei, which until now has been known primarily as a manufacturer of &quot;dongles&quot; that enable laptop computers to get mobile broadband services. Both phones will be available in the UK in time for Christmas. Both devices are designed to compete with the iPhone and both look similar to the Apple handset, though the Motorola phone has a slide-out qwerty keyboard. But it is the fact that they use Android which has excited gadget fans. The operating system has been developed under Google&apos;s auspices and is open to any developer and any handset manufacturer to build applications or devices that use it. It is seen as a major competitor to not only the iPhone platform but Microsoft&apos;s Windows Mobile and Nokia&apos;s Symbian. The first Android phone, the G1 made by Taiwan&apos;s HTC, was launched late last year by T-Mobile. Since then, the company has started selling a new version of that phone - the G2. Meanwhile, Vodafone has clinched an exclusive deal to sell the another HTC Android phone called the Magic. But the Motorola device, codenamed Morrison, will be the first Android phone from a big-name maker. It will be unveiled in the US on 10 September and in the UK five days later. Motorola has fallen from grace over the past half decade to such an extent that bosses at the US giant considered closing the cellphone division before bowing to pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to demerge the unit.  Motorola had about a quarter of the global handset market four years ago, in part thanks to its successful and ultra-slim Razr phone. But since then, its share has crashed to about 5% amid intense competition from rivals Samsung and LG and, more recently, Apple. T-Mobile, meanwhile, will widen its range of Android devices in the UK with its own exclusive deal, expected to be announced later this week, to stock the first Android device from Huawei. The phone, codenamed the Pulse, is a touchscreen device but it is designed to appeal to cash-strapped consumers.

The exiled spiritual leader offered prayers for recent victims of typhoon Morakot as he kicked off the visit, which has brought together China&apos;s two most sensitive territorial issues. Beijing said the trip was &quot;bound to have a negative influence&quot; on recently improved ties across the strait. The Dalai Lama did not discuss Tibet, although on a visit to a village buried by a mudslide he told reporters he was dedicated to promoting democracy. About 570 people died across the south of the island as Morakot unleashed harsh winds and torrential rain this month. Beijing usually criticises in harsh terms nations that allow the Dalai Lama to visit, warning that he is a &quot;splittist&quot; who wants Tibetan independence \u2013 although he insists he seeks only autonomy. Taiwan is an especially sensitive case because China still claims sovereignty over the self-ruled territory. But the tone of official comments was low key and China blamed the opposition Democratic Progressive party (DPP), which invited the Dalai Lama, rather than the ruling Kuomintang. The president, Ma Ying-jeou, who engineered the recent thaw with the mainland, approved the trip but will not meet the Buddhist leader. In December Ma said 2009 would not be an appropriate time for the Dalai Lama to visit. But when the DPP issued the invitation, he faced a choice between risking the anger of Beijing and offering ammunition to his critics, who argue that he has been too concerned with pleasing China and that the government&apos;s handling of the typhoon was slow and incompetent. His popularity has been badly dented by the disaster. &quot;I&apos;m very, very strict, [the trip is of a] non-political nature,&quot; the Dalai Lama told reporters. But he added: &quot;We are not seeking separation for Taiwan, but the fate of Taiwan depends on the more than 20 million people [here]. You are enjoying democracy and that you must preserve. I myself am totally dedicated to the promotion of democracy.&quot; He said the island should have &quot;very close and unique links&quot; with the mainland. Kneeling on the ground above what was once the village of Hsiao-lin, in southern Taiwan, he offered prayers for the estimated 500 people who died in mudslides triggered by Morakot. &quot;We welcome him and we&apos;re very happy that he&apos;s here,&quot; said Liu Ming-chuan, one of 50 former residents who had returned for the visit. Prior to his arrival in Taiwan, the Dalai Lama said it was his responsibility to accept the invitation because there were many Buddhists there.

It claims to be America&apos;s first residential detox centre for internet addicts. For a little over $14,000, up to six people at a time can spend 45 days sweating out their insatiable urge to be umbilically connected to cyberspace. Think cold turkey as experienced by heroin junkies, and you get the general idea. Residents are given counselling and psychotherapy, as well as encouraged to bond as a group in activities such as household chores, walks in the grounds and exercising. The centre, in five acres about 30 miles out of Seattle, is the brainchild of Hilarie Cash, a therapist who had until this summer been treating patients with presumed internet addiction but only on a day-by-day basis. She recorded her first case in 1994, with a patient so glued to video games that he forfeited his marriage and two jobs. Cash points out that though countries such as China, South Korea and Taiwan have places that cyber addicts can seek help, America has been slow to recognise the condition. ReSTART offers anyone who suspects they are suffering from internet addiction the opportunity to test the hypothesis with a behavioural survey which, helpfully, can be completed via the internet.

He told Associated Press that he needed to break free from a cycle of playing the video game World of Warcraft, which used to absorb almost his every waking minute. Now 19, he started playing the game when he was a first-year student at Iowa University. &quot;At first it was a couple of hours a day. By midway through the first semester, I was playing 16 or 17 hours a day,&quot; he said. By comparison to the whizz-bang on the screen in front of him, the social life at university seemed extraordinarily dull. He came to see the game as an &quot;easy way to socialise and meet people&quot; \u2013 cyber though it was. Alexander eventually quit the university and sought help with his gaming. &quot;I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll go back to World of Warcraft any time soon,&quot; he said."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/06/rbs-asian-sell-off", "publicationDate": "2009-09-06T17:45:40Z", "tags": ["Royal Bank of Scotland", "Standard Chartered", "Banking", "HSBC", "Recession", "Business"], "sentences": ["The bank sold its businesses in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia to Australia and New Zealand Banking Group last month for \u00a3325m."], "title": "RBS sells off last of Asian assets", "article": "Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is close to sealing a \u00a3200m deal to sell its retail and commercial banking operations in India, China and Malaysia to Standard Chartered, its British-based rival that specialises in emerging markets.

This perspective needs to be reversed. The great Asian war had a seismic momentum of its own. Fighting began\u00a0in 1931 and there was barely a hiatus when Japan surrendered to the allies in August 1945. Between 1941 and 1945 alone, war claimed around 24 million lives in Japanese-occupied Asia, perhaps 3 million Japanese, and 3.5 million more in India through war-related famine. Of\u00a0these victims, the European, American and Australasian casualties numbered perhaps 1% of the total. But such tallies do not convey the full scale of the tragedy. Roads to war  The roots of war lay in western imperial competition in Asia and the quest of newly modernising states such as China and Japan for wealth, power and equality. Japan&apos;s rapid industrialisation, like that of the west, required privileged access to raw materials overseas. To Japan, to be a modern power was to be a colonial power. By the 1914-1918 war, she controlled the assets of Korea and Taiwan, and demanded greater access to those of China. Resistance to Japanese imperialism was a defining moment of national awakening in China. Japan&apos;s insistence on its &quot;special interests&quot; in China flew in the face of the so-called &quot;open door&quot; policy that was backed by the United States, Britain and the League of Nations. Many Japanese soldiers and politicians now saw the international system as a form of racial exclusion, designed by the western powers to protect their own imperial interests, and to deny newcomers theirs. In 1918, Prince Fumimaro Konoe, a later prime minister, wrote that it condemned Japan &quot;to remain forever subordinate to the advanced nations&quot;. When after 1928, a stronger central government arose in China under Chiang Kai-shek, and was recognised by the west, Japan was increasingly isolated. As the great depression squeezed resources, many argued that the only way for Japan to progress was to go it alone. In 1931, Japanese armies annexed the mineral-rich Chinese province of Manchuria [Manchukuo], and created a puppet regime under Pu Yi, China&apos;s last emperor. The initiative came from commanders in the field who wanted to commit civilian politicians at home to a bolder imperial policy. In July 1937, a skirmish between Chinese and Japanese troops near Beijing was escalated by the Japanese into a war of conquest of the north-east and maritime provinces \u2192 \u2190 of China. When the capital Nanjing fell in December 1937, a huge number of civilians, probably more than 300,000, were massacred. This brutal campaign overshadows Sino-Japanese relations to this day. The Chinese government of Chiang Kai-shek fled to the inland city of Chongqing. It was weakened and corrupt, but committed to modernising China and restoring its sovereignty. A\u00a0patriotic &quot;united front&quot; was patched up between Chiang and his main rivals, Mao Zedong&apos;s communists, who gathered strength in their northern redoubt of Yan&apos;an. It was a fragile truce, not a working alliance. &quot;The Japanese are a disease of the skin,&quot; Chiang said in 1941, &quot;the communists are a disease of the heart.&quot; But Chiang had gained time and allies. President Franklin D Roosevelt&apos;s family fortune came from the China trade; he believed that a democratic China was destined to lead modern Asia. But he was not prepared to go to war for it. Nor were the British. Instead they supplied Chongqing by air and road over the &quot;Hump&quot; from British Burma. By late 1941, a US soldier, the acerbic &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell, was in effective command of Chiang&apos;s troops. He considered Chiang a &quot;stubborn bugger&quot;, reluctant to commit Chinese armies to battle, but Stilwell under-estimated Chiang&apos;s wiliness in drawing the Japanese into a long, costly war they could not win. Japan now felt even more tightly encircled by the ABCD powers: America,\u00a0Britain, China and the Dutch. The Netherlands East Indies was the best available source of oil for the war effort in China: Borneo and South Sumatra produced more than eight million tonnes a year. But blocking Japan&apos;s path to it was the British &quot;fortress&quot; of Singapore. On 27 September 1940, Japan entered into a fateful tripartite pact with Germany and Italy. For Japan, Wilhelmine Germany had been a model for a modernising, martial monarchy. As Japanese politics lurched to the right, fascism too seemed a &quot;kindred spirit&quot;. Both Germany and Japan spoke of shattering and remoulding the international order. But Japanese leaders were motivated by a deeper conviction that Emperor Hirohito was to be the nucleus of a new regional cosmology: a &quot;greater east Asian co-prosperity sphere&quot;. After the fall of Paris, Japan occupied French Indochina to cut off a supply route to Chongqing and as a springboard to the south. But the European war presented new obstacles to Japan&apos;s destiny in Asia. It caused the United States to expand its navy and to look more sympathetically upon the British empire in Asia, to help Britain fight on in Europe. Crucially, the occupation of Indochina was met by crippling economic sanctions from the United States and the west, effectively cutting off Japan&apos;s imports of oil. In late 1940 and 1941, as positions hardened and diplomacy failed, the argument was voiced in Tokyo that only by war could these obstacles be overcome. As Japan&apos;s militant new prime minster Hideki Tojo told an imperial conference on 5 November 1941: &quot;I fear that we would become a third-class nation after two or three years if we just sat tight.&quot; Japan&apos;s 70 days On 8 December 1941, Yamashita Tomoyuki&apos;s 25th Army landed on the north-east coast of Malaya and began a driving charge down the peninsula to Singapore. The British had long expected this, but failed to launch their planned pre-emptive strike into neutral Thailand, so-called Operation Matador. What was not foreseen was the simultaneous strike by air and sea at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This achieved the short-term goal of removing the immediate threat of the US Pacific fleet. But, given the fury of America&apos;s reaction, it made Japan&apos;s rather vaguer\u00a0long-term goal \u2013 a negotiated and advantageous peace \u2013 much harder to attain. The British in Malaya viewed the Japanese with racist contempt. &quot;I\u00a0suppose you&apos;ll push the little men off,&quot; was the reported reaction of the governor of Singapore. But British, Australian and Indian troops were confronted by hardened veterans of the China war, advancing 20km a day by bicycle. Allied forces fell back into Singapore with a speed that did not allow them to regroup and counter-attack effectively. But &quot;fortress Singapore&quot; was a myth. There were no fixed land defences to\u00a0speak of, few modern warplanes, and the naval base had no capital ships.\u00a0When the Prince of Wales and Repulse were sent to the South China Sea, they were sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers. Reinforcements poured into Singapore, only to witness in disgust the scorched earth destruction of the naval base they had been sent to defend. The brutal reality was that for Churchill and the chiefs of staff in London, the first call on war materials was the Mediterranean theatre. Churchill ordered the garrison to fight and die to the last man. But at the hour of the final assault on Singapore town, fearing a wholesale slaughter of civilians, local commanders were given leave to surrender on 15 February 1942. The campaign had lasted only 70 days. Lost armies  Without pause, the Japanese pressed on into the Indonesian and Philippine archipelagos. Four days after the fall\u00a0of\u00a0Singapore, bombs fell for the first\u00a0time on Australian soil. The Australian cabinet demanded the recall of their troops. Many of them were among the 85,000 soldiers marched into captivity in Singapore. The entire colonial order in Asia was incarcerated. On the best estimates, there were 130,895 civilian internees of the Japanese, more than 11% of whom were to perish. Of the 132,134 prisoners of war, 35,756 died in captivity. But these figures do not include the Asian soldiers captured, the 45,000 Filipinos who fought with the Americans, or some 40,000 Indians in Singapore. Abandoned by their European officers, the Indians were presented with a huge moral dilemma. It seemed as if the British had &quot;handed them over like cattle&quot;, and many were now recruited into a new Indian national army to fight alongside Japan for India&apos;s liberation. British prestige in Asia was shattered by the abandonment of its people. The ugly evacuation of Europeans was, as one British nurse in Penang put it, &quot;a thing that I am sure will never be forgotten or forgiven&quot;. Convinced that the British empire was on the point of collapse, Japan attacked Burma from Thailand. The initial aim was limited: to prevent the reinforcement of Malaya from India. But it became all-out conquest. British reluctance to call on the Chinese to save the British empire meant that intervention by Chinese forces under Stilwell came too late. It\u00a0cost the Chinese more than 10,000 men. As the British retreated, one of the largest displacements of people in history occurred as around 600,000 Indian refugees fled west to Bengal; as many as 80,000 of them died on the wayside. It was the Indian army that made Britain a power of consequence in Asia. During the war, more than two million Indians were recruited to arms. But Gandhi and other leaders of the Indian National Congress did not see it as India&apos;s war. The &quot;Quit India&quot; protests of 1942 were a challenge on a scale not seen since the great rebellion of 1857. As the stragglers from Burma stumbled into the great imperial city of Calcutta, it seemed to herald the imminent apocalypse of the Raj. In Burma, the Japanese were welcomed by some as liberators. Around 18,000 young nationalists travelled in their train as a &quot;Burma independence army&quot;. In the villages, they kindled a promise of freedom and martial revival. In Indonesia, it was said that the Japanese fulfilled the prophecy of the 12th-century king, Joyoboyo: that the rule of the white man would end with the coming of the dwarfish yellow men, who would reign only as long as &quot;a maize seed took to flower&quot;. But for the 2.3 million overseas Chinese of Malaya and Singapore it was the bitterest defeat. Their campaigns for &quot;national salvation&quot; had raised around one third of Chongqing&apos;s war expenditure. Chinese volunteers fought in the last-ditch defence of Singapore, and joined guerrilla bands in the jungle. One Japanese commander described entering Malaya as if it was &quot;the crossroads of the central province of China&quot;. When Singapore fell, between 50,000 and 100,000 Chinese were slaughtered in a so-called &quot;purification by elimination&quot;. Rape was an instrument of war; the standard military-issue condom was branded &quot;Assault No 1&quot;, and young girls began to be coerced as &quot;comfort women&quot; for Japanese soldiers, perhaps 80,000 to 100,000 across occupied Asia. Global war Japan&apos;s war was a gigantic gamble: that\u00a0its forces could win enough audacious victories and hold on long enough to their gains to win a favourable peace. But no American air-carriers or submarines had been destroyed at Hawaii, and they now preyed on Japanese shipping. Dutch and British &quot;scorched earth&quot; further reduced the spoils of conquest. By 1944, oil production in Indonesia was below half its pre-war level. The military-industrial arithmetic was decisive. During the war, Japan produced 70,000 warplanes; the US 300,000 \u2013 and 10 times more munitions. This was now global total war. But in many ways Japan was as isolated as ever. Axis cooperation amounted to little. The key agreements had come late in the day, and set the boundaries of each other&apos;s operations rather than combining them. There was no concerted assault on India. Strategic objectives diverged further over Russia. Japan had joined the axis partly to reduce the risk of war with the Soviets. But this again became a possibility when the Nazi-Soviet pact was thrown aside. Although Hitler disliked the idea of even &quot;honorary Aryans&quot; fighting in Germany&apos;s war of destiny in the east, Japan&apos;s help was sought in January 1943. It declined. Its &quot;final war&quot; was to be fought in the Pacific, with indifference, ultimately, to Germany&apos;s fate. By May 1942, Japan&apos;s perimeter was at its widest extent. But at the same moment, it was contained and turned back in the Pacific at Coral Sea and Midway, where the Japanese lost four carriers and more than 300 warplanes. In the south, the Japanese suffered their first defeat by land, when their landings in New Guinea were repulsed by the Australians and Americans in a series of battles that saw some of the heaviest casualty rates of the war. These were not perhaps the irreversible &quot;turning points&quot;, but they allowed the allies to think in offensive terms. One effect of containment in Asia was to allow the United States to maintain a strategy that placed &quot;Europe first&quot;. In Cairo, between 22 and 26 November 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt and Chiang came face to face for the first time. Roosevelt gave the generalissimo great power status, but privately he asked Stilwell: &quot;How long do you think Chiang can last?&quot; Chiang was not present at the conference two days later with Stalin in Tehran, at which the invasion of France took precedence over all else. The new South East Asia Command (SEAC) under Lord Louis Mountbatten did not mean, as Americans quipped, that they would &quot;Save England&apos;s Asian \u2190 Colonies&quot;. Mountbatten&apos;s cherished plans for amphibious landings in Malaya were not executed until after the surrender of Japan. Unable to take war to Japan themselves, the British employed others to wage it on their behalf. In Burma, ethnic minorities such as the Shan, Kachin and Karen were armed against the Japanese and Burmese. In Malaya, by August 1945, around 5,000 fighters of the Malayan Communist party were kitted out with guns and khaki by air drops to support the allied invasion that never came. The seeds of future confrontations were sown. The new Asia  As the first fury of conquest subsided, the Japanese attempted to build a new Asia. A formidable propaganda machine promoted Nippon language, culture and modernity, and attempted to recruit Asian leaders to its cause. This often backfired. Attempts to rally Islam by calls of jihad, and ordering worshippers in the mosques to bow in prayer not towards Mecca, but towards the imperial palace in Tokyo, outraged the Muslims of Malaya and Indonesia. Japanese pan-Asianism was less important in what it achieved for Japan than in providing a platform for Asian politicians \u2013 men such as Sukarno in Indonesia and Aung San in Burma \u2013 to realise their own national visions, and to raise their own armies. On 4 July 1943, prime minister Tojo appeared at a rally in Singapore. At his side was Subhas Chandra Bose,\u00a0a\u00a0radical Congress leader who had\u00a0escaped arrest by the British in India in 1941 and fled to Berlin. In a rare joint operation, he was transferred from a German to a Japanese submarine off the coast of Madagascar and flown to Tokyo. Bose&apos;s charisma as national leader rallied the Indians in south-east Asia behind the Indian national army. He proclaimed a provisional government of &quot;free India&quot;, and toured the region, raising funds. Young Indian women threw their jewellery at his feet and enlisted to fight alongside the men. Their call was &quot;Chalo Delhi!&quot; (&quot;On to Delhi!&quot;), the cry of the mutineers of 1857. Rumours of this soon reached India; it was the beginning of the end of the Indian army as an instrument of British power in Asia. But as war conditions deteriorated, Japanese idealism died, and most Asians only saw imperialism in another form. Japan plundered its colonies for war materials and coerced labour for the Bangkok-Rangoon railway and other projects; more than 70,000 men from Malaya alone. The supply of food broke down across all fronts. In Bengal alone in 1943, more than 3.5 million people died from starvation and disease. The loss of the rice bowl of Burma was compounded by the failures of the British Raj. Final throws  Japanese commanders saw Britain as the weakest of the enemies that encircled them. In March 1944, supported by 40,000 troops of the Indian national army, and hoping to precipitate a revolt within India, the Japanese launched their forces in Burma at the frontier. In China, the massive Ichi-go offensive attempted to destroy the airfields from which US bombers attacked Japanese shipping and cities. These were last, desperate throws of the dice. In Burma, half a million men were locked in some of the bitterest fighting of the war. The British positions in Kohima and Imphal held for five months. Then William Slim&apos;s 14th Army \u2013 Britons, Indians, Gurkhas, Africans \u2013 began to strike forward into Arakan. As reports of Japanese atrocities circulated among the troops, Slim reported, &quot;quarter was neither asked, nor given&quot;. The young Japanese soldiers they faced believed the survival of their homeland was at stake. In the words of the soldier-poet Alun Lewis, they fought &quot;Sleeplessly watching, knifing and falling back&quot;. British and Indian troops were now better led, better provisioned, and backed by US warplanes and the resources of the Indian subcontinent. But the turning of &quot;defeat into victory&quot; was largely the work of Indian soldiers, traders and officials, who would not accept a return to the status quo. The Raj was a mighty weapon of war, but once loosed, the recoil shook the British empire to its foundations. In the Pacific, General MacArthur&apos;s combined operations punched ahead towards Palau and Saipan, which put B-29 bombers in range of Japan&apos;s major cities. These turning points were achieved at a shocking human cost, and greater costs now had to be weighed: not least that of assaulting Japan&apos;s home islands. Britain was desperate to redeem the disasters of 1942 by regaining Malaya by right of arms. In China, Mao&apos;s armies grew while Chiang&apos;s faced heavy attrition. There was much blood and treasure still to be expended, and the shape of the post-war regional order was still in the balance. It was at this point that Asia&apos;s peoples began to grasp a future beyond empire. Young fighters prepared to strike out in the name of the nation. One of the abiding legacies of war was the political legitimacy it gave to men in uniform and to violent, revolutionary change. When, a year later, Japan collapsed more suddenly than anyone could have imagined, across south-east Asia and in China itself, this merely unleashed a new phase of the long and terrible Asian war.

Photograph: AP    Aquascutum trenchcoats have been worn by royalty, political leaders and celebrities ranging from three Princes of Wales, Sir Winston Churchill and Baroness Thatcher to Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Michael Caine. The British fashion brand&apos;s history stretches back to 1851 when Mayfair tailor John Emary opened a menswear shop in Regent Street. A couple of years later, he patented a method of producing a water-repellent textile. He then named the company Aquascutum, from the Latin words aqua (water) and scutum (shield). Soon the streets of Mayfair were filled with men wearing the &apos;Aquascutum Wrapper&apos;. During the Crimean war, British army officers wore the grey raincoats to withstand the Russian winter. In the late 1870s, Emary and his son left Regent Street and handed Aquascutum over to Scantlebury &amp; Commin. Under its lead, the brand became known for weather resistant and comfortable clothes for walking, riding, shooting and golf. A trademark was registered in 1895. The Aquascutum overcoats were worn by the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, who granted Scantlebury &amp; Commin Aquascutum&apos;s first royal warrant in 1897. With women leading more active lives, the company started designing shower-proof coats and suits for ladies and opened a womenswear department in 1900. In 1909, the first factory opened in Corby, Northamptonshire. Facing demand from the military, whose overcoats were usually not lined, Aquascutum came up with the trenchcoat, featuring removable, buttoned-in lining. After the first world war, the trenchcoat became part of civilian wardrobes. Second world warDuring the second world war, allied soldiers, sailors and airmen wore Aquascutum&apos;s coats into battle. After the war, the coats made it onto the silver screen with Humphrey Bogart sporting the &quot;Kingsway&quot; trench both in films and in private. Later Peter Sellers wore an Aquascutum coat in The Pink Panther Strikes Again. The 1980s saw the launch of a wide range of accessories in the club check pattern. The company went through a period of expansion, opening shops in the US, Canada, France, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore. From 1987, when she paid her historic visit to the USSR, the wardrobe of prime minister Margaret Thatcher was supplied by Aquascutum, from coats and tailored suits to dresses and evening wear. In the 1990s, Aquascutum supplied the official uniforms for the British Olympic team. Japan&apos;s Renown bought the firm in 1990.

The entrepreneur Harold Tillman, best known for his transformation of Jaeger, has clinched a deal to buy the fashion brand from its Japanese owner, Renown, for an undisclosed sum. The deal will bring two of Britain&apos;s oldest luxury brands together and create a fashion house with combined sales of more than \u00a3300m. Tillman, the chairman and majority owner of the 125-year-old retailer Jaeger, and Belinda Earl, Jaeger&apos;s chief executive, are working together on the acquisition. Earl said: &quot;We see further opportunities to build on Aquascutum&apos;s rich and long history for outerwear and tailoring as well as for new product collections.&quot; The deal puts an end to the uncertainty hanging over Aquascutum. The 158-year-old brand was put under review by Renown in the spring after turnaround plans failed. Talks of a management buyout collapsed and Aquascutum&apos;s chief executive, Kim Winser, walked out in May. The company&apos;s 340-strong workforce, including 120 at its Corby factory, were left with an uncertain future after a firm offer failed to materialise from a suitor in Hong Kong, its distributor YGM Trading, despite an informal agreement being signed. Renown had bought Aquascutum for \u00a520bn (\u00a3130m) in 1990. The acquisition is a coup for Tillman, who chairs the British Fashion Council, ahead of London fashion week. Aquascutum had also attracted interest from rival fashion house Crombie, owned by multimillionaire Alan Lewis. Aquascutum was founded in London&apos;s Regent Street in 1851 by the Mayfair tailor John Emary, who patented his new technology for producing water-resistant cloth. He then named the company using the two Latin words aqua and scutum, meaning water shield. Grey Aquascutum raincoats were worn during the Crimean war by British army officers.

Now it is the turn of the green revolution and the British are again helping to change the way the world makes its manufactured goods and generates and uses electricity so we can all have a better, safer place for civilisation to thrive. While the US dominates the Global Cleantech 100 with 55 entries, the UK is second with 13 entries and Germany comes third with 10 entries. On this page we reflect the strengths of these three countries with a selection of companies from each. All have different ideas and products designed to transform our lives. Solar is the top technology on the following pages but the UK&apos;s contribution varies from intelligent chip technology engineered to improve energy efficiency to wave and tidal energy generation. US One of the world&apos;s leading suppliers of high-power lithium-ion batteries, A123 specialises in transport, electric grid and portable power manufacturing. It is working with Chrysler, for instance, on battery modules and battery packs for Chrysler&apos;s range-extended electric vehicle and battery-only electric vehicle production programmes. In China, it is providing the batteries to power a new hybrid car in Shanghai, the SAIC Hybrid electric vehicle due out next year.  Bridgelux believes it is the first, new US-based LED (light-emitting diode) manufacturer of the past 20 years. It helps customers switch from traditional, less efficient lighting systems (such as incandescent, halogen and fluorescent lighting) to solid-state lighting solutions that are less wasteful because they generate less heat as a by-product. It provides higher performance and energy-efficient white light for indoor and exterior application areas. With its latest innovations, Bridgelux LED Arrays, the company believes it will drive down the high costs that have held back the spread of solid-state lighting. As well as addressing cost issues, the Array products are designed to optimise the quantity of light, energy efficiency, colour rendering and beam uniformity.  BrightSource builds and runs solar energy plants around the world, aiming to provide reliable and low-cost energy for both industrial and utility use. Its tested and proven LPT 550 energy system uses thousands of small mirrors to reflect sunlight on to a boiler on the top of a tower to produce high-temperature steam. The steam is then piped to a conventional turbine, which generates electricity. To conserve water, the steam is air-cooled and piped back into the system. The company is running a demonstration tower scheme in the Negev Desert in Israel.  The Tesla Roadster proves that electric cars have a future beyond short shopping trips or commuting. Weight is the enemy of efficiency in all cars, and especially those powered by electric but, thanks to its lightweight sportscar body, and the latest lithium-ion batteries, the Tesla Roadster accelerates to 60mph in 3.9 seconds, generates a third of the CO2 of hybrid cars, and has an impressive range of 240 miles at a cost of \u00a33. The next challenge: a seven-seater saloon model launching in 2011. With sales of more than 1m two-way, intelligent communication devices for smart grid management for water, gas and electricity, Trilliant can claim to be one of the biggest players in a fast-emerging market. The company, established in 2004, supplies advanced metering products that let utilities deliver higher levels of customer service and information, reduce operational costs, and provide innovative new programs, thus allowing consumers to change their consumption behaviour to take advantage of lower market prices. UK New technologies such as Acal Energy&apos;s low-cost proton exchange membrane fuel cell systems are gradually replacing traditional combustion engines. The Runcorn-based company believes it is now the world leader in this market. It promises substantial cost savings and performance improvements to clients through this clean, quiet and efficient technology which was also a crucial feature of the Gemini space missions, the first manned US flights outside the earth&apos;s atmosphere. Acal&apos;s systems are powered by its proprietary platinum-free cathode technology (FlowCath). Other projects include modules and consumable chemicals for a range of uses, including stationary, residential and automotive applications requiring more than 1kw of power.  CamSemi is a leader in intelligent power-management integrated circuits, helping the consumer electronics sector develop much more energy-efficient power supplies, lighting and other power conversion products at low cost. Products based around CamSemi chips have simple circuitry, offer high performance and exceed the demands of Energy Star, the European code of conduct and other energy-efficiency regulations. The company&apos;s C2160 products - launched this July - are designed to allow mobile phone and other manufacturers to introduce highly energy-efficient chargers - quickly and at low cost. CamSemi also has centres in Tapei, Taiwan and Shenzhen, China. How clever is your fridge? The problem with renewable energy, such as wind or solar power, is that it&apos;s difficult to plan supply and, if the sun stops shining or wind drops at times of high network usage, you&apos;d have a melted ice cream problem. Among RLtec&apos;s smart grid solutions is Dynamic Demand, a system which allows appliances to monitor their own usage and work out if they can move to lower power states for a time to limit their demand. It displaces high-carbon emitting generation with lower-carbon alternatives as much as possible and helps to facilitate the integration of renewable energy into the grid. Germany Making solar cells that are lightweight, cost-effective and efficient yet able to be integrated into the aesthetics of buildings will result in a major growth of the sector. Odersun has proved that it can be done: it has already supplied &quot;sun roofs&quot; for buildings at Beijing&apos;s Olympic Park. It does this using thin-film solar modules in a glass-foil laminate, and an innovative copper tape wiring system, which allows a significantly higher amount of modules to be interconnected in one string. Although it produces less energy that standard solar cells, its unique ability to be integrated en masse into the fabric of the building is a huge asset.  Silicon carbide and glycol are key materials in the process of making silicon wafers for solar panels but much is lost in the manufacturing process. Sic Processing&apos;s technologically advanced hydrocyclone recycling system can recover significant amounts of both materials from the slurry arising from silicon wafer production panels - this can then be reused by the manufacturer. As a result, the cost of this vital energy-harnessing product can be significantly reduced."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/sep/10/motorola-cliq-dext-launch", "publicationDate": "2009-09-10T20:49:55Z", "tags": ["Technology sector", "Telecommunications industry", "Retail industry", "Mobile phones", "Telecoms", "Google", "Business", "Motorola"], "sentences": ["There are already touchscreen phones in the market using Android, produced by Taiwan&apos;s HTC, but the Cliq is the first from a &quot;big name&quot; manufacturer."], "title": "Struggling Motorola hopes new Cliq handset can rival iPhone", "article": "The struggling American technology firm Motorola, which made the world&apos;s first mobile phone, has taken an important step in its attempt to regain its lost grandeur by unveiling its first handset that uses Google&apos;s Android software. The Cliq \u2013 which will be called the Dext when it is launched in the UK next month \u2013 will compete with Apple&apos;s iPhone and the Pre, upon which rival American group Palm has pinned its own hopes of revival, in the key Christmas market. The touchscreen Cliq has a slide-out keyboard, like the Pre; a better camera than both the Palm device and the iPhone, at 5 megapixels; and supports fast mobile broadband and wi-fi. But it is the way the phone integrates a host of social networking services \u2013 from Facebook and Twitter to the music-sharing service Last.fm \u2013 that shows how Motorola hopes to differentiate itself from the host of touchscreen phones available. Motorola has taken Google&apos;s Android operating system \u2013 designed to compete with Palm&apos;s WebOS, Apple&apos;s iPhone OS, Windows Mobile and Nokia&apos;s Symbian platform \u2013 and built a new system it calls MotoBlur out of it. It allows users to synchronise their contacts, posts, feeds, messages, e-mails and photos from sources as diverse as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Gmail, corporate e-mail and even Last.fm and have them appear on the device&apos;s screen. As a result, the phone gives users an instant snapshot of all their communication services \u2013 unlike the iPhone, which relies on users downloading and flicking between a host of applications. The Palm Pre has similar functionality for email and Facebook to the Cliq, while the low-cost INQ1 handset, from the Hutchison Whampoa-owned INQ, also allowed easy integration with the social networking site, email, internet telephone service Skype and numerous instant messaging services. But the Cliq is more integrated than any of its rivals. The phone&apos;s home screen acts almost like a window on to the user&apos;s different applications. All conversation threads, friend updates, stories, links, photos and more are automatically delivered to live widgets on the home screen. Messages are relayed through a single message hub giving an instant snapshot of emails, texts and instant messages. Even news items can be amalgamated into one feed alongside friend&apos;s postings on Facebook. The Cliq is the first of what will be many handsets from the American firm to include MotoBlur, which will become Motorola&apos;s smartphone platform of choice, though it will continue to make handsets using Windows Mobile aimed primarily at business users. &quot;Is this phone the make-or-break phone?&quot; Motorola&apos;s chief executive Sanjay Jha asked the GigaOM conference in San Francisco. &quot;No, but it is a very important starting point, it points the direction ... it is the first step in a long journey.&quot; The Cliq is also an important step for Google&apos;s Android platform. There are already touchscreen phones in the market using Android, produced by Taiwan&apos;s HTC, but the Cliq is the first from a &quot;big name&quot; manufacturer. Samsung, LG and Sony Ericsson are all expected to produce Android phones in the coming months, leaving Nokia, the world&apos;s largest mobile phone manufacturer, as the only one of the top five handset makers not experimenting with the Google platform. Two Drunks Jha said coming together with the Android platform, which is run by Google&apos;s head of mobile Andy Rubin, was like &quot;two drunks finding each other in a bar&quot;, which rather highlights the perilous state in which the company has found itself in recent years. Motorola&apos;s fall from grace has been long and hard. Having made the DynaTAC 8000x in 1983, the first commercially available mobile phone (an unwieldy beige handset), it went on to dominate the market with Ericsson but the switch to digital phones in the 1990s found Motorola unprepared and its share started to slip as Nokia came to dominate the global market. Motorola then started this decade as the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world \u2013 accounting for one in four of all handsets sold \u2013 but still the market leader in the US. But it failed to follow-up the success of the ultra-slim Razr phone, initially launched six years ago, with another headline-grabbing product, preferring instead to try the same handset in a variety of different colours or with slight technical improvements. By the time the iPhone appeared two years ago, Motorola was in freefall. In the three months to end June, Motorola sold just under 16m phones, giving it just 5.6% of the market, compared with 10% the previous year, and putting it firmly in fourth place behind Nokia, Samsung and LG. Orange has grabbed the Cliq/Dext under an exclusive deal with Motorola for the UK. Pricing will be announced in the UK next week but the phone is expected to be free to anyone signing up to a long-term contract of between \u00a325 and \u00a330 a month, making it cheaper than the iPhone. Ralf Gerbershagen, vice-president and general manager of Motorola Western Europe, told the Guardian: &quot;This is a day we have been waiting for for quite a while. &quot;You have to have a great piece of hardware in the market and we believe that we have this with Dext, and you have to have a good brand and we believe Motorola is a very strong brand in the marketplace,&quot; he said. &quot;Motorola is a global player and it is geared up to remain a global player&quot;. MotoBlur is designed to cope with the bewildering array of web-based communication tools available, he added. &quot;There are more social networking accounts around the world than email accounts and the reason is many people have a couple of them.&quot; The Dext, he argued, would help consumers take charge. &quot;In the end, technology is there to make your life simpler.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/taiwan-jails-former-president-corruption", "publicationDate": "2009-09-11T10:30:19Z", "tags": ["Taiwan", "China", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["A Taiwanese court today sentenced former president Chen Shui-bian to life in prison after finding him guilty of corruption.", "He won power in 2000, having campaigned on a pledge to clean up Nationalist corruption and deepen Taiwan&apos;s de facto independence.", "Chen angered Beijing with pro-independence views and also alienated Taiwan&apos;s most important ally, the US, which feared that his stance was increasing the risks of a war and damaging US-China relations.", "Most Taiwanese believe the former president is guilty of at least some of the charges against him, but supporters fear the decision to prosecute him was politically influenced.", "President Ma Ying-jeou and justice ministry officials have said Chen&apos;s prosecution upholds the democratic principle that no one stands above the law in Taiwan."], "title": "Taiwan court jails former president Chen Shui-bian for corruption", "article": "A Taiwanese court today sentenced former president Chen Shui-bian to life in prison after finding him guilty of corruption.

He said the couple had also been fined a total of NT$500m (\u00a39m). Chen, the former Democratic Progressive party leader, was the first non-Nationalist to lead the self-ruled island since Chiang Kai-shek fled there at the end of the civil war in 1949. Prosecutors had charged Chen with embezzling \u00a31.9m from a special presidential office fund, accepting bribes of about \u00a35.4m in connection with a land deal, laundering money through Swiss bank accounts, and forging documents. The 58-year-old pleaded not guilty \u2013 at one point going on hunger strike \u2013 and claimed he was being persecuted for his anti-Beijing views by his successor, Ma Ying-jeou, who has thawed relations with China. Hundreds of Chen supporters demonstrated outside the court in Taipei holding flags and banners saying &quot;Free him&quot; and &quot;Chen&apos;s innocent&quot;. Chen, who has been held in a suburban Taipei jail since late December, chose not to attend today&apos;s proceedings. He won power in 2000, having campaigned on a pledge to clean up Nationalist corruption and deepen Taiwan&apos;s de facto independence. But the Nationalist majority in the legislature, and his alleged tendency to play fast and loose with accepted procedures, quickly caused him problems. Chen angered Beijing with pro-independence views and also alienated Taiwan&apos;s most important ally, the US, which feared that his stance was increasing the risks of a war and damaging US-China relations. An appeal is automatic and experts say it is too early to tell how long he will serve even if his conviction is upheld. Most Taiwanese believe the former president is guilty of at least some of the charges against him, but supporters fear the decision to prosecute him was politically influenced. Critics also say that Chen was unfairly confined to jail during his trial. The three-judge panel originally trying him agreed he did not need to be held, but it was replaced by a new panel which accepted prosecutors&apos; arguments that he might flee or collude with co-conspirators. President Ma Ying-jeou and justice ministry officials have said Chen&apos;s prosecution upholds the democratic principle that no one stands above the law in Taiwan. &quot;I think basically most people still have confidence that the trial itself was relatively fair and feel that something had to be done to deal with corruption,&quot; said Andrew Yang, secretary-general of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies. &quot;People had very high expectations of [Chen] dealing with corruption by the former government. Unfortunately, he himself was deeply involved.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/11/second-world-war-rebuilding", "publicationDate": "2009-09-11T11:05:01Z", "tags": ["Second world war", "World news"], "sentences": ["In the east, Japan of course lost the conquests it had made since 1931, but was also obliged to disgorge Korea and Formosa (now Taiwan) and the Pacific islands that it had gained decades earlier."], "title": "Rebuilding the world after the second world war", "article": "At the end of the first world war it had been possible to contemplate going back to business as usual. However, 1945 was different, so different that it has been called Year Zero. The capacity for destruction had been so much greater than in the earlier war that much of Europe and Asia lay in ruins. And this time civilians had been the target as much as the military. The figures are hard to grasp: as many as 60 million dead, 25 million of them Soviet. A new word, genocide, entered the language to deal with the murder of 6 million of Europe&apos;s Jews by the Nazis. During the war, millions more had fled their homes or been forcibly moved to work in Germany or Japan or, in the case of the Soviet Union, because Stalin feared that they might be traitors. Now, in 1945, another new word appeared, the DP, or &quot;displaced person&quot;. There were millions of them, some voluntary refugees moving westward in the face of the advancing Red Army, others deported as undesirable minorities. The newly independent Czech state expelled nearly 3 million ethnic Germans in the years after 1945, and Poland a further 1.3 million. Everywhere there were lost or orphaned children, 300,000 alone in Yugoslavia. Thousands of unwanted babies added to the misery. It is impossible to know how many women in Europe were raped by the Red Army soldiers, who saw them as part of the spoils of war, but in Germany alone some 2 million women had abortions every year between 1945 and 1948. The allies did what they could to feed and house the refugees and to reunite families that had been forcibly torn apart, but the scale of the task and the obstacles were enormous. The majority of ports in Europe and many in Asia had been destroyed or badly damaged; bridges had been blown up; railway locomotives and rolling stock had vanished. Great cities such as Warsaw, Kiev, Tokyo and Berlin were piles of rubble and ash. In Germany, it has been estimated, 70% of housing had gone and, in the Soviet Union, 1,700 towns and 70,000 villages. Factories and workshops were in ruins, fields, forests and vineyards ripped to pieces. Millions of acres in north China were flooded after the Japanese destroyed the dykes. Many Europeans were surviving on less than 1,000 calories per day; in the Netherlands they were eating tulip bulbs. Apart from the United States and allies such as Canada and Australia, who were largely unscathed\u00a0by the war&apos;s destruction, the European powers such as Britain and France had precious little to spare. Britain had largely bankrupted itself fighting the war and France had been stripped bare by the Germans. They were struggling to look after their own peoples and deal with reincorporating their military into civilian society. The four horsemen of the apocalypse \u2013 pestilence, war, famine and death \u2013 so familiar during the middle ages, appeared again in the modern world. New &apos;superpowers&apos; Politically, the impact of the war was also great. The once great powers of Japan and Germany looked as though they would never rise again. In retrospect, of course, it is easy to see that their peoples, highly educated and skilled, possessed the capacity to rebuild their shattered societies. (And it may have been easier to build strong economies from scratch than the partially damaged ones of the victors.) Two powers, so great that the new term &quot;superpower&quot; had to be coined for them, dominated the world in 1945. The United States was both a military power and an economic one; the Soviet Union had only brute force and the intangible attraction of Marxist ideology to keep its own people down and manage its newly acquired empire in the heart of Europe. The great European empires, which had controlled so much of the world, from Africa to Asia, were on their last legs and soon to disappear in the face of their own weakness and rising nationalist movements. We should not view the war as being responsible for all of this, however; the rise of the US and the Soviet Union and the weakening of the European empires had been happening long before 1939. The war acted as an accelerator. It also accelerated change in other ways: in science and technology, for example. The world got atomic weapons but it also got atomic power. Under the stimulus of war, governments poured resources into developing new medicines and technologies. Without the war, it would have taken us much longer, if\u00a0ever, to enjoy the benefits of penicillin, microwaves, computers \u2013 the list goes on. In many countries, social change also speeded up. The shared suffering and sacrifice of the war years strengthened the belief in most democracies that governments had an obligation to provide basic care for all citizens. When it was elected in the summer of 1945, for example, the Labour government in Britain moved rapidly to establish the welfare state. The rights of women also took a huge step forward as their contribution to the war effort, and their share in the suffering, were recognised. In France and Italy, women finally got the vote. If class divisions in Europe and Asia did not disappear, the moral authority and prestige of the ruling classes had been severely undermined by their failure to prevent the war or the crimes that they had condoned before and during it. Established political orders \u2013 fascist, conservative, even democratic \u2013 came under challenge as peoples looked for new ideas and leaders. In Germany and Japan, democracy slowly took root. In China, people turned increasingly from the corrupt and incompetent nationalists to the communists. While many Europeans, wearied by years of war and privation, gave up on politics altogether and faced the future with glum pessimism, others hoped that, at last, the time had come to build a new and better society. In western Europe, voters turned to social democratic parties such as the Labour party in Britain. In the east, the new communist regimes that were imposed by the triumphant Soviet Union were at first welcomed by many as the agents of change. The end of the war inevitably also brought a settling of scores. In many parts people took measures into their own hands. Collaborators were beaten, lynched or shot. Women who had fraternised with German soldiers had their heads shaved or worse. Governments sometimes followed suit, setting up special courts for those who had worked with the enemy and purging such bodies as the civil service and the police. The Soviets also tried to exact reparations from Germany and Japan; whole factories were dismantled down to the window frames and were carted off to the Soviet Union, where they frequently rotted away. Much of the revenge was to gain advantage in the postwar world. In China and eastern Europe the communists used the accusation of collaboration with the Japanese or the Nazis to eliminate their political and class enemies. German de-Nazification The allies instituted an ambitious programme of de-Nazification in Germany, later quietly abandoned as it became clear that German society would be unworkable if all former Nazis were forbidden to work. In\u00a0Japan, the head of the occupation, General Douglas MacArthur, broke up the zaibatsu, the big conglomerates that were blamed for supporting the Japanese militarists, and introduced a range of reforms, from a new school curriculum to a democratic constitution, that were designed to turn Japan into a peaceable democratic nation. In both Germany and Japan, the victors set up special tribunals to try those responsible for crimes against peace, war crimes, and the catalogue of horrors that came increasingly to be known as &quot;crimes against humanity&quot;. In Tokyo, leading Japanese generals and politicians, and at Nuremberg, senior Nazis (those that had not committed suicide or escaped), stood in the dock before allied judges. Not a few people then and since wondered if the trials were merely victors&apos; justice, their moral authority undercut by the presence, in Nuremberg, of judges and prosecutors from Stalin&apos;s murderous regime, and by the fact that in Tokyo, the emperor, in whose name the crimes had been committed, was shielded from blame. The trials, inconclusive though they were, formed part of a larger attempt to root out the militaristic and chauvinistic attitudes that had helped to produce the war, and to build a new world order that would prevent such a catastrophe from ever happening again. Well before the war had ended, the allies had started planning for the peace. Among the western powers, the United States, by 1945 very much the dominant partner in the alliance, took the lead. In his Four Freedoms speech of January 1941, President Roosevelt talked of a new and more just world, with freedom of speech and expression and of religion, and freedom from want and fear. In the Atlantic charter later that year, he and Churchill sketched out a world order based on such liberal principles as collective security, national self-determination, and free trade among nations. A host of other allies, some of them represented by governments in exile, signed on. The Soviet Union gave a qualified assent, although its leader Stalin had no intention of following what were to him alien principles. Roosevelt intended that the American vision should take solid institutional form. The key organisation was the United Nations, designed to be stronger than the League of Nations, which it was replacing, and the economic ones known collectively as the Bretton Woods system, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the General Agreement on Trade\u00a0and Tariffs.\u00a0This time, Roosevelt was determined, the United States should join. Stalin again gave grudging\u00a0support. Common humanity While much of what Roosevelt hoped for did not come about, it was surely a\u00a0step forward for international relations that such institutions were created and largely accepted and, equally important, that they were underpinned by notions of a common humanity possessing the same universal rights. The idea that there were universal standards to be upheld was present, no matter how imperfectly, in the war crimes trials, and was later reinforced by the establishment of the United Nations itself in 1945, the International Court of Justice in 1946 and Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. It had already become clear at the top-level conferences of Teheran (1943), Yalta (February 1945) and Potsdam\u00a0(July-August 1945) that there was a gulf in what constituted universal\u00a0values and goals between the United States and its fellow democracies and the Soviet Union. Stalin was interested above all in security for his regime and for the Soviet Union, and that to him meant taking territory, from Poland and other neighbours, and establishing a ring of buffer states around Soviet borders. In the longer run, where the western powers saw a democratic and liberal world, he dreamed of a communist\u00a0one. The grand alliance held together uneasily for the first months of the peace, but the strains were evident in their shared occupation of Germany, where increasingly the Soviet zone of occupation was moving in a communist direction and the western zones, under Britain, France and the United States, in a more capitalist and democratic one. By 1947, two very different German societies were emerging. In addition, the western powers watched with growing consternation and alarm the elimination of non-communist political forces in eastern Europe and the establishment of Peoples&apos; Republics under the thumb of the Soviet Union. Soviet pressure on its neighbours, from Norway in the north to Turkey and Iran in the south, along with Soviet spy rings and Soviet-inspired sabotage in western countries, further deepened western concerns. For their part, Soviet leaders looked on western talk of such democratic procedures as free elections in eastern Europe as Trojan horses designed to undermine their control of their buffer states, and regarded the Marshall plan, which funnelled American aid into Europe, as a cover for extending the grip of capitalism. Furthermore, their own Marxist-Leninist analysis of history told them that sooner or later the capitalist powers would turn on the Soviet Union. Within two years of second world war&apos;s end, the cold war was an established fact. Both sides built military alliances and prepared for the new shooting war that many feared was bound to come. In 1949, the Soviet Union exploded its first atomic bomb, giving it parity, at least in that area, with the United States. That the cold war did not in the end turn into a hot one was thanks to that fact. The terrifying new power of atomic weapons was to lead to a standoff suitably known as Mad \u2013 Mutually Assured Destruction. The cold war overshadowed another momentous international change that came as a result of the second world war. Before 1939 much of the non-European world had been divided up among the great empires: the ones based in western Europe but also those of Japan and the Soviet Union. Japan and Italy lost their empires as a result of defeat. Britain, France, and the Netherlands all saw their imperial possessions disappear in the years immediately after the war. (The Soviet Union was not to lose its until the end of the cold war.) Empires crumble The former imperial powers no longer had the financial and military capacity to hang on to their vast territories. Nor did their peoples want to pay the price of empire, whether in money or blood. Furthermore, where the empires had once dealt with divided or acquiescent peoples, they now increasingly faced assertive and, in some cases, well-armed nationalist movements. The defeat of European forces all over Asia also contributed to destroying the myth of European power. The British pulled out of India in 1947, leaving behind two new countries\u00a0of India and Pakistan. Burma,\u00a0Sri Lanka and Malaysia followed\u00a0the road of independence not long after. The Dutch fought a losing war but finally conceded independence\u00a0to Indonesia, the former Dutch East Indies, in 1949. France tried to regain its colonies in Indochina but was forced out in 1954 after a humiliating defeat at the hands\u00a0of Vietnamese forces. The Europeans&apos; African empires crumbled in the 1950s and early 1960s. The United Nations grew from 51 nations in 1945 to 189 by the end of the century. Because of the cold war, there was no comprehensive peace settlement after the second world war as there had been in 1919. Instead there were a number of separate agreements or ad hoc decisions. In Europe most of the borders that had been established at the end of the first world war were\u00a0restored. The Soviet Union seized back some bits of territory such as Bessarabia, which it had lost to Romania in 1919. The one major exception was Poland, as the joke had it &quot;a country on wheels&quot;, which moved some 200 miles to the west, losing some 69,000 sq metres to the Soviet Union and gaining slightly less from Germany in the west. In the east, Japan of course lost the conquests it had made since 1931, but was also obliged to disgorge Korea and Formosa (now Taiwan) and the Pacific islands that it had gained decades earlier. Eventually the United States and Japan concluded a formal peace in 1951. Because of an outstanding dispute over some islands, the Soviet Union and its successor Russia have not yet signed a peace treaty ending the war with Japan. Remembering the war We have long since absorbed and dealt with the physical consequences of the second world war, but it still remains a very powerful set of memories. How societies remember and commemorate the past often says something about how they see themselves \u2013 and can be highly contentious. Particularly in divided societies, it is tempting to cling to comforting myths to help bring unity and to paper over deep and painful divisions. In the years immediately after 1945, many societies chose to forget the war or remember it only in certain ways. Austria portrayed itself as the first victim of Nazism, conveniently ignoring the active support that so many Austrians had given the Nazi regime. In Italy, the fascist past was neglected in favour of the earlier periods of Italian history. For a long time, schools did not teach any history after the first world war. Italians were portrayed in films or books as essentially good-hearted and generally opposed to Mussolini, whose regime was an aberration in an otherwise liberal state. In France, the Vichy period, after France&apos;s defeat by Germany, when there was widespread French collaboration, some of it enthusiastically antisemitic and pro-Nazi, was similarly ignored. From de Gaulle onwards, French leaders played up the resistance in such a way as to claim its moral authority but also to imply that it was more broadly based and widespread than it actually was. West Germany was not able to escape its past so easily; under pressure from the allies and from within, it dealt much more thoroughly with its Nazi past. In West German schools, children learned about the horrors committed by the regime. East Germany, by contrast, took no responsibility, instead blaming the Nazis on capitalism. Indeed, many East Germans grew up believing that their country had fought with the Soviet Union against Hitler&apos;s regime. In the east, Japan has been accused of ignoring its aggression in the 1930s and its own war crimes in China and elsewhere, but in recent years it has moved to teach more about this dark period in its history. How should the past be remembered?\u00a0When should we forget? These are not\u00a0easy questions. Acknowledging such difficult parts of the past is not always easy and has led to history becoming a political football in a number of countries. In Japan, the conservatives minimise Japanese responsibility for the war and downplay atrocities on nationalist grounds. Japan, they argue, should not apologise for the past when all powers were guilty of aggression. It has not necessarily been easier among the nations on the winning side. When French and foreign historians first began examining the Vichy period in France critically, they were attacked from both the right and the left for stirring up memories that were best left undisturbed. When the Soviet Union collapsed, there was, for a time, a willingness among Russians to acknowledge that many crimes were committed in Stalin&apos;s regime in the course of the war, whether the mass murder of Polish army officers at Katyn or the forcible deportation of innocent Soviet citizens to Siberia. Today, the conservatives argue that such criticism of the great patriotic war only gives comfort to Russia&apos;s foes. Britain and Canada played a major role in the mass bombing campaign of German cities and towns; suggestions that the destruction of Dresden or other targets that may have had little military significance might be war crimes causes impassioned debate in both countries. That the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki might have been morally wrong or unnecessary causes equal controversy in the United States. Today, particularly in the countries that were on the winning side, there is a reluctance to disturb our generally positive memories of the war by facing such issues. The second world war, especially in the light of what came after, seems to be the last morally unambiguous war. The Nazis and their allies were bad and they did evil things. The allies were good and right to fight them. That is true, but the picture is not quite as black and white as we might like to think. After all, one ally was the Soviet Union, in its own way as guilty of crimes against humanity as Nazi Germany, fascist Italy or Japan. Britain and France may have been fighting for liberty, but they were not prepared to extend it to their empires. And Dresden, or the firebombing of Hamburg, Tokyo and Berlin, the forcible repatriation of Soviet prisoners of war, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, should remind us that bad things can be done in the name of good causes. Let us remember the war, but let us not remember it simplistically but in all its complexity.

Doesn&apos;t it get terribly dirty? &quot;Yes, but that is beautiful,&quot; Barenbrug enthuses. &quot;I used this and everything became grey, everything became dirty. It is\u2026&quot; he uses a Dutch word and searches for the English, inadvertently making one up. &quot;What is the word? &apos;Smuggy&apos;, that is nice. If you have kids, you soon find out that once they are in your stroller it will get smuggy anyway, there is nothing you can do about it,&quot; he starts to laugh, &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter.&quot; He has a habit, he says, of approaching people in the street, if something on their Bugaboo isn&apos;t connected properly. &quot;I take all the crumbs and all the food and vomit and everything for granted,&quot; he says. You have to embrace the vomit and the poop? &quot;Mm hmm,&quot; he says, nodding his head vigorously. &quot;Mm hmm.&quot; You don&apos;t need to have children to have heard of Bugaboo, you just need to know a middle-class parent. Actually, all you need do is open the paper, and there will be a celebrity mum or dad pushing the 4x4 of prams, which cost up to \u00a3660, along the pavements of Primrose Hill. There is a healthy resale market on eBay for anyone who can&apos;t afford them new. Barenbrug says the company is quite strict about not giving the prams away to celebrities. Madonna paid for hers, he says, as do members of the Dutch royal family, although he did give one to his favourite Dutch actress, Kim van Kooten. He does, he admits, &quot;like it a lot&quot; when he sees members of the A-list pushing his buggies. Others pictured with a Bugaboo have included Gwyneth Paltrow, Stella McCartney, Gwen Stefani and Matthew McConaughey. Barenbrug produced his first Bugaboo as his final year project at Eindhoven Design Academy, 15 years ago. The original idea was to make a pram that a man would like, and the chunky design and solid colours owed much to the aesthetics of outdoor gear used for climbing or camping. &quot;It had to be tough, it had to be multifunctional, it had to be used outdoors. Like you want a car, you want this stroller,&quot; he says. &quot;The parent that buys this buys it for themselves.&quot; People, he says, don&apos;t suddenly change because they have children. He yanks a model from the shelves and energetically turns it into a two-wheeler to show how it could be used on the beach. The one-piece handlebar, allowing dad to steer with one hand, the ability to switch the seat from front-facing to parent-facing and its modular design, as well as the use of more fashionable fabrics, made it different, he says. He tried to sell the concept to a pram manufacturer for a number of years but failed to spark any interest. His then brother-in-law, Eduard Zanen, invested some money and they made the buggy themselves, from a factory in Taiwan, displaying them at an industry fair in Cologne. That attracted huge interest, including an offer for the company. Instead they decided to go it alone. The first Bugaboo came onto the market in 1999. Today the company employs 800 people, Bugaboos are on sale in 50\u00a0countries and the company has annual revenues of \u20ac70m (\u00a363m). Eight months ago, Barenbrug hired a chief executive to run the company, Nico Moolenaar, allowing him to focus on design. The design has evolved in the past decade. The tread in the tyres has changed because customers complained that dog faeces got wedged in, and the suspension improved after Barenbrug had his own two daughters. The company also launched the Bee, a smaller, lightweight version. Nurseries in west London had started banning the Bugaboo because they were taking up too much space. Another key moment for the brand came when one was used on Sex and the City, before it was available in the US. It got a huge amount of press coverage. Before Bugaboo, the market had been &quot;very backward&quot; Barenbrug says, with manufacturers simply trying to make prams as cheap as possible. It is a feat, though, to convince consumers they should pay four or five times what they ordinarily would for a product. It is like Starbucks convincing us to spend \u00a32.40 on a coffee. Barenbrug doesn&apos;t like the comparison. &quot;Starbucks I don&apos;t like. They don&apos;t give value for money, period. I take a big circle round to avoid Starbucks,&quot; he says, walking in a big circle. A better comparison, Moolenaar says, is Bang &amp; Olufsen, the high-end stereo equipment. Bugaboo does especially well in Spain, Holland and Britain, although it is not so strong in the US, where Barenbrug says price remains the main driver in the market. The status attached to a Bugaboo has brought it equal adoration and loathing. &quot;People buy it because the neighbour has it, this I don&apos;t like,&quot; Barenbrug says. &quot;What I like is when people really like this product for what it is.&quot; But there is undeniably a snob value. &quot;Well, this is true, but what can I say? I continuously say in interviews that the product is worth it. You get value for money.&quot; The company is still 50/50 owned by Barenbrug and Zanen, who is largely a sleeping partner. Moolenaar has been brought in to make the business run more efficiently and to drive its expansion. One plan is to put the Bugaboo name onto other &quot;mobility&quot; products, from bicycles to bags and walking frames for the elderly and disabled. Another is to speed up production of new models. &quot;It is like any other company that has been going for 10 years, you go from the pioneering stage to the more mature stage and you have to revisit your structure and policies and management,&quot; Moolenaar says. To mark its 10th anniversary, the company said it would donate 1% of revenues to Red, which battles HIV and Aids in Africa. The company is also launching a website at the end of the year to sell its products. But it feels as if Barenbrug is straining against the corporate bit. He confides that he is thinking of moving the design team from the corporate headquarters on an industrial estate back to the centre of Amsterdam. He wants, he says, to have better lunch options. &quot;This is catered, I don&apos;t like it,&quot; he says, wrinkling his face. He also tells a revealing story about the Bugaboo name. He came up with it when he looked up buggy in the dictionary and saw the word bugaboo. The definition, he says, was a little goblin or ghost. &quot;I liked the name because it was teasing. An annoying little ghost. But our PR agency started going through all the dictionaries in the world to give it a more &apos;proper&apos;, positive meaning and found one. It is something to do with striving or continuing. I wasn&apos;t happy with it.&quot; You preferred the original? &quot;Of course, yes, but you have to let go sometimes. We are a big company now.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/20/sarkozy-de-villepin-clearstream-trial", "publicationDate": "2009-09-20T18:52:42Z", "tags": ["France", "Nicolas Sarkozy", "World news", "Europe"], "sentences": ["The accounts were said to have been used for laundering kickbacks from the \u00a31.5bn sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991."], "title": "Sarkozy and De Villepin enter court battle over alleged smear campaign", "article": "It has been billed as France&apos;s political trial of the decade, a saga worthy of the darkest spy thriller that threatens to expose poisonous machinations and backstabbing at the highest reaches of the French state. Tomorrow morning, in the courtroom where Marie-Antoinette was ordered to be beheaded in 1793, a legal battle will begin that is unprecedented in modern French history. France&apos;s president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is the key plaintiff in a trial accusing the former prime minister Dominique de Villepin of running an elaborate smear campaign to damage Sarkozy&apos;s chances in the 2007 presidential election campaign. If De Villepin is found guilty of a plot to torpedo Sarkozy&apos;s political career, he could face five years in prison. But the so-called &quot;Clearstream&quot; trial involves not just the all-consuming hatred and rivalry between two of France&apos;s most prominent politicians. It also threatens to damage the standing of the French intelligence services and business world. Scores of plaintiffs and witness from the highest levels of French politics, senior spies and businessmen, will take part in the trial which former president Jacques Chirac once warned would damage the entire French political class. Sarkozy is so bent on justice that he has vowed to hang those responsible for the alleged plot &quot;on a butcher&apos;s hook&quot;. De Villepin, who privately refers to Sarkozy as &quot;the dwarf&quot;, denies wrongdoing, saying the president is &quot;obsessed&quot; and &quot;meddling&quot; in the justice system by forcing the case to trial. The saga dates back to 2004, when Sarkozy and De Villepin were rival ministers under Chirac and both possible runners for the 2007 presidency. Sarkozy, the young, ambitious finance minister who had turned against Chirac, his one-time mentor, was the favourite to lead the country. De Villepin, who served as foreign and interior minister before becoming prime minister, was an aristocratic career diplomat, a Napoleon fan who Chirac called his &quot;commando-in-chief&quot;. In the summer of 2004, an anonymous source wrote to one of France&apos;s investigating judges, accusing a string of politicians and businessmen of holding secret bank accounts at the Luxembourg bank Clearstream. The accounts were said to have been used for laundering kickbacks from the \u00a31.5bn sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991. On the lists of supposedly crooked account holders were scores of politicians from the right and left, top businessmen, leading journalists, even a famous female actor. The most prominent name was Sarkozy&apos;s. The judge soon found that the allegations were false and the accounts did not exist. However, senior intelligence officers and France&apos;s top spymasters were said to have been tasked with investigating the matter, in what Sarkozy saw as a deliberate move to &quot;sully&quot; his name. Sarkozy suspected Chirac and De Villepin of a plot and vowed to find out where the fake lists had come from. He lodged a legal complaint, as did other figures wrongly accused. The court must now decide how the lists came to light, how much De Villepin knew about them, when he learned that they were fake and whether he sought to deliberately take advantage of them. Prosecutors will argue that De Villepin prompted his friend, Jean-Louis Gergorin, an executive of the defence aviation group Eads with links to intelligence services, to pass on the list confidentially to the judge, even though he knew it to be false. De Villepin flatly denies the charges and says he is the victim of a grave &quot;injustice&quot;. One of the key witnesses at the trial will be the French former spymaster Philippe Rondot, who said he had been asked to investigate the Clearstream claims. His notes from meetings with De Villepin were published in Le Monde and appeared to suggest that De Villepin had an &quot;obsession with Sarkozy&quot;. In his jottings, he had written: &quot;Political stake: N. Sarkozy. Fixation on Sarkozy (re: conflict J. Chirac/N. Sarkozy).&quot; De Villepin and Chirac denied Rondot&apos;s claims. De Villepin is charged with &quot;complicity in slander, the use of forged documents and possession of goods obtained by breach of trust and theft&quot;. Beside him in the dock are Gergorin and his associate Imad Lahoud, a former trader and computer specialist accused of faking the list; management consultant Florian Bourges, accused of stealing Clearstream documents; and journalist Denis Robert, who broke the story. They deny the charges. Sarkozy will not be present in court. As president he holds judicial immunity and does not have to testify. De Villepin&apos;s lawyers said today they would challenge the president&apos;s role as a plaintiff, which they say threatens the concept of a fair trial. There are around 40 civil plaintiffs in the case, including politicians from the right and left such as the interior minister Brice Hortefeux. The hearing is expected to last a month, and a verdict is expected early next year. Sarkozy v De Villepin As well as Sarkozy, around 40 other prominent business and political figures whose names were falsely included on the list of bogus accounts, have filed complaints as plaintiffs in the case. They include Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former Socialist finance minister and now head of the IMF; Brice Hortefeux, the centre-right interior minister and Sarkozy&apos;s best friend; the former interior minister Charles Pasqua; and the businessman Arcadi Gaydamak. Witnesses called to give evidence will include the former PM Jean-Pierre Raffarin and former French intelligence chief Yves Bertrand, as well as several key French figures at the top of France&apos;s secret services, including the retired general and intelligence officer Philippe Rondot, who was one of the first to question the reliability of the lists of accounts."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/22/chinese-protesters-hack-website", "publicationDate": "2009-09-22T10:50:39Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture", "China", "Dalai Lama", "Internet", "Taiwan", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["     Chinese protesters have hacked the website of a Taiwanese film festival over its plans to screen a film about exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer.", "The hackers had added the words: &quot;anti-Xinjiang, anti-Tibet and anti-Taiwan independence."], "title": "Chinese hackers strike again in protest over Uighur activist film", "article": "     Chinese protesters have hacked the website of a Taiwanese film festival over its plans to screen a film about exiled Uighur activist Rebiya Kadeer.

The film has angered Chinese authorities, who accuse her of stirring up the violence in Xinjiang in July. Kadeer, who is based in the US, strongly denies the allegations. Anyone who viewed the Kaohsiung festival website yesterday would have found its usual content replaced with a digitally altered photograph of Kadeer and the Dalai Lama, along with obscenities accusing the pair of being sexually promiscuous.

Now the world&apos;s his oyster.  Backstory  Born in south London, 1974, to Bangladeshi parents, Akram Khan began dance at the tender age of three. He was taught Bengali folk dance by his mother and at seven, began studying kathak (a classical dance style from north India) with teacher Pratap Pawar. The initial push to train came from his mother; at the time, Khan preferred watching Knight Rider on TV, or perfecting his Michael Jackson routines.  It was while performing with the Academy of Indian Dance in 1984, that Khan was spotted by the legendary director Peter Brook. Still only in his teens, he later went on to tour internationally in Brook&apos;s epic production Mahabharata. At a loss for what to do after A-levels and under pressure to get a degree, Khan opted for a contemporary dance course at Leicester&apos;s De Montfort University. He transferred to the Northern School of Contemporary Dance to train more rigorously as a dancer \u2013 and graduated with the highest marks ever awarded by the school.  Khan&apos;s first solos quickly attracted attention \u2013 not only was he bold and inventive in his experimentations with kathak, but he was a mesmerising performer. After appearances at the Dance Umbrella festival and a spell performing with acclaimed choreographer Jonathan Burrows, he joined the X-Group project, a creative programme for young choreographers at Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker&apos;s PARTS school in Brussels.      'He never has any down time' ... Detail from portrait of Akram Khan by Darvish Fakhr (2008). Photograph: PR    Building on work he created there, Khan returned to London later the same year and founded his own dance company. A meteoric rise followed. Just two years later in 2002, Khan made his first full-length work. He also began touring internationally, was the subject of ITV&apos;s South Bank Show, expanded his company and picked up a string of awards both in the UK and beyond.  Alternating with his company work, Khan continues to present solo recitals of classical kathak dance. In addition to this, he has made pieces for the Ballet Boyz, Cloudgate Dance Theatre of Taiwan, and er, Kylie Minogue (he choreographed a section of her 2006 Showgirl tour). His schedule seems endlessly packed; when he sat to have his portrait done last year for the National Portrait Gallery, artist Darvish Fakhr said that Khan would &quot;fall asleep immediately, because he never has any down time&quot;.      Akram Khan and Sylvie Guillem in Sacred Monsters (2008). Photograph: Tristram Kenton    Watching Akram Khan  Khan&apos;s dance roots are in kathak \u2013 and it shows. It&apos;s a style characterised by mathematically complex rhythmic footwork, spins, fluid arm and hand gestures, as well as dynamic contrasts between speed and stillness.  That background permeates his contemporary work. Sometimes he uses moves directly from kathak, even where he doesn&apos;t, his style has a lot of rhythmic interest \u2013 the arms circle and slice around the head and torso, and bursts of action and sudden freezes. Khan has also often used speech and storytelling in his pieces.  Khan is a compelling performer with a soloist&apos;s command of the stage. As with other distinctive soloists (such as Wayne McGregor) his earliest group compositions tended to look like refractions of his own presence. Later, he made a trilogy of duets in which he was counterbalanced by a very different presence: Belgian dancer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui in the masterful Zero Degrees (2005); French ballerina Sylvie Guillem in Sacred Monsters (2006) and French film actor Juliette Binoche in in-I (2008). Khan did not dance in his most recent piece Bahok (a collaboration with the National Ballet of China, 2008), and the choreography is consequently more tailored to the diverse talents of his international dancers.  He attracts high-profile collaborators, most frequently Nitin Sawhney as composer, but also artists Anish Kapoor and Antony Gormley, and writer Hanif Kureishi.  Who&apos;s who  Pratap Pawar is Khan&apos;s &quot;guruji&quot;, his kathak teacher. Far more than producer, Farooq Chaudhry is effectively Khan&apos;s company partner. Nitin Sawhney is often Khan&apos;s musical collaborator. South African dancer Shanell Winlock, a long-standing company member, is also Khan&apos;s wife.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton    Fact  When Khan first went into the studio to begin work on in-I with Juliette Binoche, she simply repeated everything he said and did \u2013 continuously, for two hours. How&apos;s that for an icebreaker?  In his own words  &quot;My real break was winning a junior school disco competition dancing to Michael Jackson&apos;s Thriller.

At the G20 Pittsburgh summit, the US, France and the UK will accuse Tehran of building a secret nuclear weapons capability and threaten further UN sanctions. This will ratchet up tensions and trigger renewed speculation that Israel might launch a pre-emptive strike. So far, US-led efforts to increase pressure on Iran have failed in large part because of Russia&apos;s hostile stance in the UN security council. During Vladimir Putin&apos;s presidency (2000-08), Russia repeatedly opposed more punitive measures against Iran. Fuelled by a combination of anti-Americanism and renewed geopolitical ambition, Moscow insisted that Tehran had a sovereign right to build nuclear power stations \u2013 with Russian technological support. But now that the Obama administration is moving its anti-ballistic missile shield from land-based installations in eastern Europe to mobile vehicles closer to Iran, the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, declared on Wednesday at the UN in New York that &quot;sanctions are seldom productive but they are sometimes inevitable&quot;. With the &quot;reset&quot; of US-Russian relations, the Kremlin has performed a spectacular &quot;rethink&quot; of its Iran policy. The &quot;secret&quot; Moscow visit by Binyamin Netanyahu on 7 September seemed to reassure the Russian leadership that Israel would not launch unilateral pre-emptive strikes against suspected Iranian nuclear installations \u2013 on the condition that Moscow promise not to equip Iran with the advanced S-300 system, an offensive missile capability that could deliver nuclear warheads. If Russia drops its opposition to further sanctions, China is likely to agree or at least to abstain because Beijing&apos;s policy is to avoid isolation within the UN security council \u2013 except to block international interference in Chinese interests in Sudan or foreign meddling in &quot;internal&quot; issues such as Taiwan and Tibet. Critics will be correct to argue that more UN sanctions against Tehran&apos;s nuclear activities are hypocritical, as they would perpetuate the inequality between non-nuclear states deemed too dangerous to have the bomb and nuclear states that are &quot;not all stable or democratic&quot;, as Simon Jenkins has rightly remarked. Even Obama&apos;s US has not heeded President Hu&apos;s call for all nuclear-weapon countries to adopt China&apos;s &quot;no first use&quot; policy, providing Iran and North Korea with reasons to fear a US pre-emptive strike. Tehran and Pyongyang won&apos;t so quickly forget the fate of Iraq. That&apos;s why so much depends on American and Russian commitments to reduce and eventually abandon their nuclear arsenals. US-led punitive measures also tend to be counter-productive, as they turn countries into pariah states and embolden repressive regimes. Here Russia has a key role to play. Moscow is better placed than the west to help Iran develop its domestic economy by modernising the oil and gas sectors. Without renewed Russian investment in Iran&apos;s largely obsolete energy industry, the oil-funded Mullah theocracy will struggle to hold on to power in the face of growing resistance \u2013 especially since the fraudulent re-election of President Ahmadinejad. Together with Qatar, Russia and Iran (who together account for more than 60% of global natural gas reserves) are establishing a &quot;gas troika&quot; focusing on liquefied natural gas (LNG) that could lead to the biggest state-sponsored joint venture in the global energy market. Along with new supply routes to emerging markets in Asia, LNG could produce a decoupling of the gas and oil price. With the oil price set to fall again once the current commodity bubble bursts (which it will when expansionary measures like &quot;quantitative easing&quot; are scaled back), the gas price would not be adversely affected, making investment in the gas sector more lucrative yet. Moreover, the nascent global recovery, especially in China and other Asian countries, will increase demand for cleaner energy like natural gas. That is why the proposed &quot;gas troika&quot; is building a new pipeline system linking Iran to Qatar and ultimately to Asia. The plan is to pump gas from Iran&apos;s South Pars deposit, the world&apos;s largest with estimated reserves of about 14 trillion cubic metres, via a pipeline on the Persian Gulf floor to a LNG plant in Qatar&apos;s Ras Laffan province (about 100 miles from the deposit). Qatar has signed a contract with China to supply 7m metric tons of LNG per year. South Korea&apos;s rapidly increasing consumption of liquefied gas creates another significant source of demand for gas produced by the troika, estimated to be worth $4bn. Involving Qatar, which hosts a major US military basis, has the additional advantage of easing tensions between Iran and the Gulf states, which are increasingly nervous about Tehran&apos;s hardline stance. On this key issue and on the Israel-Palestine peace process, the Kremlin has now the unique chance to act as an honest broker. In short, Moscow can combine the stick of economic and political sanctions against the ruling regime with the carrot of technological and financial support for developing Iran&apos;s energy sector. None of this will guarantee Tehran&apos;s compliance with international demands to disclose all its nuclear-related activities. But Russian leverage can make an important difference in defusing the growing tensions that threaten the entire Middle East."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/sep/27/christianity-models-agency-fashion", "publicationDate": "2009-09-26T23:06:55Z", "tags": ["Fashion", "Christianity", "Models", "Religion", "Life and style", "World news", "UK news"], "sentences": ["MOL claims to have affiliates in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, Canada, Australia and Europe."], "title": "Christian modelling agency preaches spiritual fulfilment to the fashion world", "article": "The small, Asian girl approaches the tall, white girl on a Northern line tube heading out of King&apos;s Cross and asks her if she is a model. The tall girl, who is startled but flattered, demurs. &quot;But you are so tall, you should be,&quot; the small girl says, before starting up a conversation and introducing a friend who, judging by her striking looks, appears to come from eastern Europe. The pair represent an organisation called Models of Life that is scouring London and other cities for fresh modelling talent. The small girl scribbles down her details and hands a card to the tall girl, urging her to check out the organisation&apos;s website. Similar approaches are being made every day to girls by modelling agencies looking to find the next Kate Moss or Agyness Deyn. But Models of Life (MOL) is unique, for it is the first organisation of its kind operating in Britain that seeks to mix Christianity and the catwalk. According to its impressive website, dominated by pictures of smiling young women, MOL &quot;has its beginnings in the 1990s when the founder sought to challenge and to renew modelling culture. Its philosophy, based on Christian values, is to make people aware that modelling is about leading an exemplary life and exuding inner beauty.&quot; In the rarefied world of modelling where new fads are accepted in a nanosecond, Models of Life&apos;s philosophy stands out starkly. &quot;To be a model is to set an example,&quot; it proclaims. &quot;Just at a time when the controversy over skinny models reflects how the perception of beauty is evolving, MOL aims to raise the standard of models to a new height: beauty achieved from the perfect balance and unity of spirit, mind, and physical body.&quot; It might sound like the sort of platitude spouted by Derek Zoolander \u2013 the male supermodel portrayed by Ben Stiller in his parody of the fashion industry \u2013 but a model who claims to have benefited from MOL&apos;s classes, 20-year-old Ruth Kadereit, says the approach works. &quot;I think it really helped me to use my time better and accept myself,&quot; she says on the website. &quot;[It helped me] understand and remind myself of the value of life and live with joy each day.&quot; Girls keen to follow Kadereit&apos;s example are encouraged to sign up for MOL&apos;s popular modelling classes, the next round of which are due to be held at a dance studio in Fulham this week. Several Anglican churches have also been used to hold MOL fashion events in the past and a vicar spoken to by the Observer said he was a great believer in its work. Those who may have doubts about MOL&apos;s philosophy will perhaps be reassured by its size. It seems to have the sort of global presence that many of the leading modelling agencies can only envy. MOL claims to have affiliates in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the US, Canada, Australia and Europe. Its models have featured on catwalks around the world, even appearing in South Korea at football&apos;s World Cup finals opening ceremony in 2002, an event that was watched by hundreds of millions. The organisation&apos;s attempt to bring a spiritual element to the world of modelling may seem baffling: as Matthew 5:28 observes: &quot;Anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&quot; But the nexus between religion and modelling is well documented in the US where a Models for Christ ministry was established in 1984. &quot;We are a global community of professionals who are seeking to honour God as we navigate the unique opportunities and challenges within the fashion industry,&quot; the not-for-profit ministry proclaims. Then there is the Christian Talent Network, a New York-based organisation that promises clients it will find &quot;possibilities available for you in the exciting world of modelling and TV commercials&quot;. One of America&apos;s original supermodels, Kim Alexis, who in the 80s was a face of Revlon, is a born-again Christian who has become an anti-abortion activist. More recently, Kathy Ireland, a Californian model, has published several books expressing her faith, including Real Solutions for Busy Moms: 52 God-Inspired Messages for Your Heart. Conversely, MOL appears reluctant to talk about its relationship with religion or indeed anything else. Repeated requests for an interview last week with the organisation were rejected. Little more can be gleaned about it other than that its international website was set up by someone who gives their address as a small flat in Battersea and the main players behind its European division, founded two years ago, are said to be three women from South Korea. The organisation appears to file no accounts and has no permanent UK headquarters. One person familiar with the organisation&apos;s modelling classes said they featured little more than &quot;rather limp modelling&quot; but seemed popular and were attended by scores of aspiring models: &quot;It was just about telling people how to walk \u2013 they are generally all girls in the classes and very tall girls at that.&quot; A woman called Hannah Park who books venues for the organisation, declined to talk to the Observer. &quot;What is the problem with what we are doing?&quot; she asked. &quot;In any high street you will find modelling agencies approaching young girls, that is how they operate.&quot; Indeed. But Laurie Kuhrt, chairman of the Association of Model Agents, which represents the UK&apos;s top agencies, questioned whether religion and the catwalk can make for happy bedfellows. &quot;If they&apos;re genuinely trying to make contact with people with a view to turning them into good, honest Christians, I don&apos;t have a problem with that,&quot; he said. &quot;But modelling is not about exuding inner beauty, it is about selling goods and services. When we recruit people it&apos;s solely because we think they can do big advertisement campaigns and appear on catwalks. If they can&apos;t do that, we lose a lot of money.&quot;"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/01/china-60th-anniversary", "publicationDate": "2009-10-01T07:00:00Z", "tags": ["China", "Human rights", "World news", "Law", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, are all examples of successful authoritarian capitalist countries."], "title": "The people's republic rising at 60 | Tim Dunne", "article": "Today, 1 October, the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC) celebrates its 60th birthday. This is a good moment to evaluate what kind of country China has become. One might argue, as Churchill did of Russia, that it is &quot;a riddle wrapped up in mystery, inside an enigma&quot;. The enigma is the Communist party and its grip on power, and the mystery is whether an authoritarian power can embrace capitalism without sowing the seeds of its own demise. If there are many unknowns about China, perhaps the place to start is with what we do know. The PRC is a global power. It is a permanent member of the UN security council and plays an increasingly important role in the determination of international security concerns. From North Korea to Iran, China is a pivotal power in terms of multilateral measures to limit nuclear proliferation. To be a global power requires more than military might. In an age of globalisation, global powers have to be economic titans. China is certainly one of these. It has become the world&apos;s second biggest economy (or third if we are to count the EU as a single power rather than a union of 25 different countries). Its growth rate over the last three decades has averaged an annual rise in GDP of in excess of 10%. What, then, is the mystery? It might seem ironic to invoke Marx&apos;s analysis of capitalism to answer this question. Marx believed that capitalism&apos;s advance would not be halted by &quot;Asiatic&quot; modes of economic activity that he regarded as backward. Mao&apos;s successor, Deng Xiaoping, agreed with Marx and embarked on a course of modernisation that would have been heretical to the architects of the Cultural Revolution. Marx&apos;s other insight into economic development raises an altogether more haunting spectre for Chinese elites. He believed that social relations inevitably followed the path of economic progress. The more open and competitive an economy becomes, the greater the pressure to liberalise political institutions and democratise civil society. China wants the former while resisting the latter; the party, we are told by Chinese leaders, must retain a monopoly over ideas and institutions. The history of development in the west suggests economic and political liberalisation are inseparable. For capitalism to work efficiently, so the argument runs, political power must be ceded to political parties and organisations that represent the interests of the working class. In other words, far from being a threat to capitalism, social democracy is in fact essential to its durability. Ideologies of modernisation, whether they spring from the left or the right, imply that there is only one path to development. Asian economies have so far resisted this trend. Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, are all examples of successful authoritarian capitalist countries. The question is whether such a model could apply to a country as large and complex as China. The scale of the modernisation challenge facing the PRC should not be underestimated. It may be the second largest economy in the world, but remember also that it is not in the top 100 in terms of its level of income per head of population. What this suggests is that capitalism has so far only benefited a narrow segment of the urban middle class. That leaves hundreds of millions on the periphery, condemned to the informal economy and vulnerable to the ups and downs of the business cycle. The PRC government estimates that the global financial crisis has resulted in 20 million migrant workers losing their jobs. While economists probe the relationship between economic and political liberalisation, experts on international relations weigh up the relationship between economic and military power. Will a rising China become a threat to western interests? Leading US-based scholars answer this question with a straight &quot;yes&quot;. As John Mearsheimer argued in his book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, all previous global powers have first sought to dominate their region before pursuing competitors further afield. Why, he asks, should we expect China to be any different? The policy advice given by these so-called realists is that the United States should contain China&apos;s rise in order to maintain America&apos;s technological and strategic superiority. This may seem superficially sensible but in truth it is flawed. The flaw stems from believing that China is only interested in pursuing strategies that further its own national interest at the expense of the greater good. It is correct to argue that great powers have historically demanded that the regional leadership be respected; the United States has insisted this be the case in Latin America, and the EU has arguably played the same game, only through enlargement rather than the more overt method of threatening or using force. China believes it too can exert regional dominance by peaceful means \u2013 its neighbours; however, do not always see it this way. History suggests another dynamic associated with great power politics, and that is the importance of status. China&apos;s relationship with western countries can be fruitfully understood in terms of a struggle for acceptance. In the 1800s, China was denied the usual rights associated with sovereign statehood, including the right of non-intervention which was traduced during the opium wars and the diplomatic treaties associated with their aftermath, not least the annexation of Hong Kong for the British crown. One way of responding to China&apos;s rise is to recognise the importance of status. By and large this is happening: the US is no longer seeking to cajole China into democratisation. Instead of beating the drum of containment, as realists do, or insisting on compliance to western ideas, as liberals propose, a better policy is to enmesh China in the multilateral order such that it binds itself to the institutions and purposes of the system overall. Churchill&apos;s famous quotation about Russia implied that understanding the national interest was more predictable than trying to understand the particular traits and habits of a foreign culture. On this he was wrong. Getting to grips with the mystery of authoritarian capitalism, and the enigma of the struggle for status, is more likely to yield results in the case of China than relying on the riddle of the national interest."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2009/oct/03/teaching-english-foreign-language", "publicationDate": "2009-10-02T23:00:01Z", "tags": ["Graduate careers", "Money", "Tefl", "Languages", "Education", "Graduate", "Forums", "Education", "Guardian Careers"], "sentences": ["For these applicants, their primary interests may be geared towards other areas: for example, savings potential, learning another language, building a more impressive CV, avoiding unemployment at home.&quot; For Jessica Mendes Rego, 24, the opportunity to learn Chinese was a\u00a0key factor in her decision to take up a\u00a0teaching post in Taiwan this month.", "&quot;I chose Taiwan as I want to learn Mandarin, because I think it is a really important language,&quot; she says.", "&quot;I\u00a0started reading up on China but the wages in Taiwan are better.", "I think the salary they have given me is enough to have a reasonable lifestyle as well as save money.&quot; Jones says jobs in the regions Reach To Teach recruits for \u2013 predominantly South Korea, Taiwan and China \u2013 provide salaries that enable teachers to live comfortably and come home with savings, but that initial set-up costs vary between countries and can be a key factor in choosing a location, particularly for those graduates with little in the way of savings.", "With Taiwan, most people need to come over with about $1,500 (\u00a3940) \u2013 assuming they have a job waiting for them."], "title": "Graduate careers: Eastern promise", "article": "Having a degree used to open doors for new graduates, but with unemployment rising in the midst of the recession, many of this year&apos;s university leavers are finding it difficult to get work in the UK.

There has long been a demand for native English speakers to teach their language in the far east and, though the economic downturn has also hurt Asian nations, language tuition is one expense many people and companies are reluctant to cut back on. Richard Jones, the director of recruitment at Reach To Teach, an agency placing native English speakers in Asian schools, says there are good jobs for those who commit to year-long contracts. Teaching experience and/or professional qualifications aren&apos;t necessary, although a degree (in any subject) is a standard requirement.

With Taiwan, most people need to come over with about $1,500 (\u00a3940) \u2013 assuming they have a job waiting for them. &quot;China is a bit of a mixed bag; some schools pay for flights, some pay for accommodation \u2013 it varies a lot between provinces and employers.&quot; Rego sees teaching and Chinese language skills as directly relevant to her future career; but what about graduates with different employment aspirations? Is a year spent teaching English still likely to look good on their CV? Yes, reckons Charlie Ball, the deputy research director at Graduate Prospects. &quot;It&apos;s more about the softer skills than the specific language or cultural skills that you pick up,&quot; he says. &quot;A lot of the concerns that graduate recruiters have seem to be to do with independence and maturity, because when coming out of university a lot of graduates are very young people with not a great deal of solid life experience. &quot;Evidence of this kind of work can really help them bridge that gap.

Not for a decade, since the heyday of the designer Rifat Ozbek, has the appellation of &quot;young Turk&quot; been so apt in the British fashion industry. Erdem, who had an English mother and a Turkish father, was brought up in Canada and has been clasped to the bosom of British fashion since his acclaimed autumn/winter collection last year. Depth of colour was the key then, and still is. The designer says he often starts with digital images on fabric and bright, blurring colours. &quot;I want to recreate the idea of movement and memory you have on a train,&quot; he recently explained. He was the toast of the town again at his London fashion show last week when Knightley and Newton demonstrated the class of his cutting. He is not showing in Paris in the week ahead, but catwalk talk there is about how long it will be before a major French fashion house lures him away. A few days ago, as Labour party conference delegates in Brighton steadied themselves for the main attraction \u2013 Gordon Brown&apos;s pre-election rallying cry \u2013 the role of warm-up act fell again to Sarah Brown. Her words were loyal, some felt saccharine, but her silk print Erdem dress was judged a hit. A warm splurge of strong colours, it marked her as a woman confident in her appearance. Her faith in Erdem moved some to compare him with Jason Wu \u2013 the Taiwan-born designer beloved of Michelle Obama. The American first lady has won praise for her support of homegrown talent. Even those without an interest in fashion have seen her wardrobe choices as a spirited way to make the most of public scrutiny. Brown, shod in Jimmy Choo, is treading the same path. How these blossoming designers feel about a close association with women no longer in the first flush of youth is less clear. Tamsin Blanchard, in Paris for the shows this weekend as style director of the Telegraph Magazine, urges Erdem to welcome such ambassadors. &quot;It is a great boost for him because \u2013 after all \u2013 he does make a pretty grown-up style of clothes,&quot; she said. &quot;It is just the right thing for him because of the market he appeals to. He is not going to get the grooviest young things wearing his clothes anyway.&quot; Blanchard sees the style marriage of Erdem and Brown as win-win. &quot;Sarah looks great in it, so I think it is something he should embrace. If you look at what Michelle Obama has done, and how many young fashion careers she has boosted, it is about time Sarah did the same for British designers,&quot; she said. Erdem&apos;s vision does indeed seem to fit in the mould of those whose serene styling has graced the backs of royalty and stateswomen. He cites Mainbocher, the American couturier who designed some of Wallis Simpson&apos;s clothes, as a formative influence. His muse, the ideal woman he designs for, is &quot;quite seasonless, in a way&quot;. &quot;She&apos;s a woman who does what she wants and is strong,&quot; he has said, admitting he owes much of his taste to the memory of his late mother. &quot;It&apos;s going to sound so Oedipal, but my mum was so well-dressed and lovely, she was quite important.&quot; Before she became Mrs Brown, the prime minister&apos;s wife enjoyed a brilliant career as Sarah Macaulay, one half of the publicity agency Hobsbawm Macaulay Communications. This was the company credited with a key role in securing the victory of New Labour in 1997, with its polished events and clever re-positioning of the party. So, if she has not shown fashion-forwardness up to this point in her Downing Street years, it may have been a deliberate strategy, to avoid attracting too much attention and perhaps also to make the feminist point that her clothes are possibly not quite as important as her husband&apos;s policies. Clothes, and what to do with them, first became an unavoidable issue for the political wife on that day in 1961 when Jackie Kennedy arrived on a state visit to London \u2013 a devastating and demure political asset for her husband. From then on, the wives of prime ministers and presidents have had to find a delicate balance, appearing neither too staid nor too vulgar. It can be a fine line between dowdy and garish when you are lining up for the photocall at an international summit. The advent of Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, with her model looks and sultry singing career, has further upped the ante for the first ladies of the western world, and now there is no going back. When Bruni, a consummate fashion mannequin, turned up at Heathrow in March last year, her choice of outfit won her front-page slots in most British newspapers. Her neat dove-grey beret and matching Christian Dior coat were a cut above anything seen on the world stage for some time. Recently, perhaps influenced by Michelle Obama, Bruni has mixed classic French designers such as Herm\u00e8s and Dior with forays into modern haute couture. In February she wore a dress by the promising Paris-based designer Alexis Mabille to a gala dinner. When the G20 met last month in Pittsburgh, Bruni went head-to-head with the American first lady, wearing a cap-sleeved black sheath dress that ended just below her knees. Obama appeared in an adventurous floral strappy number, selected from Thakoon&apos;s latest resort collection. Critics chose their favourites, but the result was widely considered a score draw. Last year all eyes were on the newcomer to the scene: Samantha Cameron \u2013 the woman who hopes to be moving her dresses into Brown&apos;s closet next year. She too has favoured Erdem&apos;s designs and helped establish his name. According to Averyl Oates, buying director at Harvey Nichols, the appeal of Erdem to both Brown and Cameron has been of great value to the London industry. &quot;The recent appearances of Samantha Cameron and Sarah Brown wearing Erdem have been an appropriate, and refreshing, nod to the fabulous British fashion of today,&quot; she said. &quot;The combination of the current recession and the much-lauded return of many great British designers for London Fashion Week, I think celebrates our British defiance in hard times, and marks British fashion firmly on the international stage.&quot; Now Cameron is to go one further. As creative director of the stationery brand Smythson, she has invited Erdem to create a selection of notebooks and diaries that will launch in November. His designs are thought to include abstract, Japanese-style floral prints. This is certainly a step beyond merely publicising a British designer by wearing his clothes, and underlines Cameron&apos;s status as an independent, though thoroughly complementary, political accessory. It only proves the lesson that Harold Wilson learned the hard way when he wore the Gannex raincoats sold by his corrupt friend Joseph Kagan; the lesson that Michael Foot was to learn, too, when in the early 1980s he put on what appeared to be a workers&apos; donkey jacket for a Remembrance Day appearance at the Cenotaph \u2013 for those in the public eye, clothes are always political."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/04/toy-story-3-philip-french", "publicationDate": "2009-10-03T23:08:25Z", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "sentences": ["The ontological confrontation in Andy&apos;s nursery between Woody, the cheerful sheriff who knows he&apos;s a toy, and Buzz Lightyear, the state-of-the-art toy from Taiwan who believes he&apos;s a real astronaut, is handled with wit and imagination."], "title": "Toy Story in 3D | Film review", "article": "The first feature-length film created entirely on a computer, Toy Story put Pixar Films on the map when it first appeared 13 years ago and is back in the cinema looking and sounding as good as ever, neither enhanced nor diminished by 3D.

But suddenly a slurping sound startled the sleeper. Everything seemed completely normal \u2013 until he noticed the green liana which had grown from the pot plant and reached his body.  &quot;Every movement became impossible, and every scream was smothered by the plant material that was growing around his mouth and throat. Thoughts raced through the mind: This wasn&apos;t a nightmare, the reality of the room was far too distinct and his perception and thinking were far too clear. Were the plants taking revenge on humankind, or had aliens conquered the planet?&quot; The above account sounds like a scene from a bad horror movie. But it isn&apos;t. Dr Stephan Matthiesen, a physicist at the School of Geosciences, University of Edinburgh, sent me the account last year saying he had personally experienced this terrifying scenario and lived to tell the tale. It&apos;s taken from his book The Normality of Altered States of Consciousness. Dr Matthiesen is a scientist and looked for a rational explanation of what had happened. He was right do so, because what he had experienced was an example of a surprisingly common phenomenon known as sleep paralysis. Many similar experiences have been reported to the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit I coordinate at Goldsmiths, University of London. One of our students, Peter Moore, used to suffer from sleep paralysis on a regular basis. One night, for example, he awoke to find himself unable to move and with a strong feeling of tension across his chest, making it almost impossible to breathe. He could see his bedroom and managed to tilt his head, only to see an evil-looking black cat sitting there hissing at him.  But what was most terrifying about this vision was that the cat&apos;s white skull was inverted and dripping some sort of black goo. By a huge effort of will, he finally managed to break out of his paralysed state with the intention of attacking his visitor, only to find himself delivering a right hook to thin air. Jeremy Deane, a fellow student at Goldsmiths still suffers regular attacks of sleep paralysis, particularly if his usual sleep pattern has been disrupted. As is often reported, he can experience multiple episodes in a single night. His experiences typically involve paralysis, difficulty breathing, strange proprioceptive hallucinations such as his body vibrating, and bizarre &quot;hyper-real&quot; visual hallucinations during which objects may metamorphose into nightmarish objects.  For example, clothes lying on the floor may become dead bodies or a ceiling fan might turn into a &quot;faery&quot; with the blades as wings and the central bulb as an animate, speaking face. In his own words: &quot;The experience is usually terrifying, but I have been able to control it and sometimes it has been very pleasant (occasionally there can be a sexual element, or &apos;floating&apos; feelings accompanying what appears to be an out-of-body experience).  &quot;Common images are bearded, goblin-like demons laughing or whispering sinister speech, a faceless girl (usually covering her face with hair, moving around in bed moaning and feeling my body), hands appearing from the wall and attempting to strangle me. A hung man talking in the corner of the room, and some of the most bizarre experiences may include up to a dozen &apos;critter&apos; entities (think Gremlins movie) laughing and talking about me. The environment tends to feel like a holographic dollhouse, the experience peaks and then the hallucinations mysteriously vanish when I regain control of my body.&quot; There are numerous descriptions of sleep paralysis in works of fiction, from Herman Melville&apos;s Moby Dick to accounts by F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. There are also the classic artistic depictions painted by Henry Fuseli in the late 18th century.  Not surprisingly, episodes of sleep paralysis are often interpreted by the sufferer in paranormal terms, but sleep researchers have provided a more convincing account.  During normal sleep, the brain and body pass through four stages of sleep during which physiological indices such as brain activity, heart rate and breathing rate gradually slow down. This process then reverses and the sleeper enters a period of REM-stage sleep, so-called because of the characteristic rapid eye movements that are associated with it.  The full cycle, which takes about 90-100 minutes, is then repeated and, as the night progresses, each cycle becomes progressively less dominated by stage 3 and stage 4 sleep and increasingly dominated by REM sleep. Dreams can occur during all sleep stages but the most vivid dreams tend to be reported when people are awoken from REM sleep.  Throughout these REM periods the muscles of the body are paralysed, presumably to prevent the dreamer from acting out the dream. During sleep paralysis episodes, however, something goes awry with the normal process and the individual becomes aware of the fact that they cannot move. This can be scary enough, but in a minority of cases, such as those described above, this curious mix of normal wakeful consciousness and dream consciousness can result in bizarre and often terrifying hallucinations. Our own research confirms the results of previous surveys in showing that sleep paralysis in its most basic form is surprisingly common. Although sleep paralysis is a common symptom of narcolepsy (a condition characterised by uncontrollable bouts of deep sleep), around 40% of the rest of the population report that they have had the experience.  Around one in 20 people report experiencing associated symptoms, including a strong sense of a presence, difficulty breathing due to pressure on the chest, intense fear, and a wide range of hallucinations. These can be visual (lights or dark shadows moving around the room, monstrous figures), auditory (voices, footsteps, mechanical sounds), tactile (feeling that one is being touched or dragged off the bed or that the bedclothes are being pulled off), and/or proprioceptive (body or limbs vibrating, rapid acceleration of the whole body, out-of-body experiences). Fortunately, most people never experience sleep paralysis, and of those that do, most only experience it once or twice in their lives, usually in its most basic form. Furthermore, most people in modern Western societies, although somewhat shaken by the experience, just shrug it off as some kind of nightmare. But a small minority assume that either the events they experienced were real, or else they are losing their sanity.  If you are one of those people, possibly suffering in silence because of fear of being ridiculed or even being treated for a psychiatric disorder, please be reassured. You are not the victim of nocturnal attack by spirits or attempted abduction by aliens. Neither are you at greater risk than the general population of serious psychopathology. Although most people do not opt for a paranormal interpretation, the experience is so common it only requires a small percentage of sufferers to do so to account for the very large number of claimed paranormal encounters.  Sufferers can be just as terrified by the experience even if the episode does not involve any ostensibly paranormal content, sometimes experiencing their unwanted intruder as a burglar, a murderer or a rapist. Even sufferers who are well-informed about sleep paralysis and do not experience the more florid symptoms described above still experience intense fear unlike anything they experience in waking life.  This strongly suggests that the fear is not a consequence of the experience but an integral part of it, possibly caused by over-activation of the amygdala, the part of the brain that is responsible for fear. This is illustrated by an account from Lori Ball, a healthy 53-year-old woman from Ohio who is not only well-informed about sleep paralysis but is actually cognisant of what is happening to her while it&apos;s happening: &quot;I try to scream (though I have great difficulty making any sound), attempt to flail around, anything, to get the attention of my husband. It is a feeling of panic, entrapment and desperation so horrifying that I have difficulty describing its magnitude.  &quot;If my spouse notices my discomfort and responds, in my mind it&apos;s never soon enough. One cannot simply tell me to &apos;wake up&apos; and tap me on the arm. Often I need to be shaken somewhat to be fully present. At that point I wouldn&apos;t care if he slapped me hard as the terror of being in that paralysed state, totally helpless, is overwhelming. Knowing that it will end eventually is of no comfort. Every second is hell.&quot; One of the most fascinating aspects of sleep paralysis for me is the different ways that the same core experience is interpreted across different cultures. Accounts from Europe in the Middle Ages indicate that sleep paralysis episodes were often interpreted in terms of nocturnal visits by witches or sex-crazed demons.  Even today, many societies interpret such experiences in supernatural terms based upon folklore. In Newfoundland, belief in the &quot;Old Hag&quot; who sits on the sleeper&apos;s chest and suffocates them is common. The Japanese speak of kanashibari, a type of nocturnal spiritual attack.  In St Lucia, the same core experience is explained as the souls of unbaptised children who crawl on to the sleeper&apos;s chest and throttle them. Over the summer, I visited Taiwan to set up a cross-cultural study of sleep paralysis with colleagues at Kaohsiung Medical University. In China and Taiwan, sleep paralysis attacks are often referred to as &quot;ghost oppression&quot; and levels of supernatural belief are very high among the Taiwanese population.  In our study, we are interested not only in the degree to which such high levels of belief affect the tendency to interpret the experience in supernatural terms but also the degree to which pre-existing belief systems can affect the content of the hallucinations themselves. Sleep paralysis offers an almost unique opportunity to study the reciprocal interaction between biology and culture.  It seems likely that the core experience has itself played a role in the development of belief systems relating to the spirit world in many cultures and that those very belief systems, once elaborated upon, are then capable of influencing the hallucinatory content of sleep paralysis episodes in subsequent generations. Chris French is a professor of psychology at Goldsmiths where he heads the Anomalistic Psychology Research Unit.

Beijing had worried during Obama&apos;s presidential campaign that a Democratic win might signal a protectionist stance towards China and overconcern with perceived human rights issues, but these fears had not proven grounded. Yes, there were tensions, most prominently about the US naval surveillance activity within China&apos;s special economic zone in the South China Sea. Yes, there were also a few ongoing major disagreements that Beijing and Washington still urgently needed to thrash out, on matters such as climate change. But what had been impressive, even extraordinary, was that the handful of public frictions never reached crisis point, and were all dealt with within a climate of rather friendly negotiation. Bilateral relations had been in a generally good state during President Bush&apos;s last years in office, but during the first months of a new administration in Washington there has almost always been a downturn in the attitude toward China, so the cordial start was unexpected and highly welcome. It is this happy context that makes the US president&apos;s decision on 11 September to slap high tariffs on cheap imported Chinese tyres so surprising and enraging to Beijing. Many Chinese see it as humiliating that Obama took this drastic action immediately after Wu Banguo, head of China&apos;s National Congress, had declared his visit to Washington to be a great success \u2013 especially given that the president himself had not raised the prospect of Sino-US trade disputes since taking office. Beijing&apos;s anger was expressed instantly and in the strongest terms by the ministry of commerce, the main national government agency dealing with foreign trade. It condemned the tyre tariff decision as a &quot;grave protectionist action&quot; and an &quot;extremely bad precedent&quot;, warned that &quot;abusing trade relief measures will damage China-US trade relations&quot; and made a clear threat of trade retaliation. This kind of language is rarely used by Beijing so it carries real force. However, at the same time, the ministry&apos;s reaction shows a sophisticated streak of restraint. In its statement the ministry mentions that the US government was &quot;forced by domestic political pressure&quot; to raise its &quot;unreasonable demands&quot;, a phrase that partially exonerates the US policymakers. The threatened retaliation involving American chicken parts and motor parts, in the words of the Christian Science Monitor, &quot;seems designed to minimise the impact of any retaliatory measures it might take&quot;, because chicken parts accounted for a little over 1% of overall US poultry exports to China last year and in the first half of 2009 fell sixfold from even this insignificant level, while China reduced import tariffs on auto parts a little over two weeks ago, which, as the Christian Science Monitor says, &quot;would appear to limit its ability to impose serious new sanctions on such goods&quot;. The honeymoon may be ending, but the Chinese government still puts a high value on relations with the United States and President Obama. The relationship can weather this storm. President Obama visits Beijing in November and both parties will try to prevent this dispute spilling over into something much more serious. The Chinese government&apos;s strong reaction (limited thus far mainly to harsh words) to Obama&apos;s tyre tariff decision seems fuelled by its sensitivity to business and public opinion. The former fears US protectionist measures, while the latter (at least a large part of it) has long been much more critical toward the US in its relations with China than the Chinese government. &quot;We must take a forceful posture in dealing with the US, even withdrawing from the WTO,&quot; one Chinese internet user wrote on a bulletin board on 16 September about the tyre tariff affair, using much more moderate language than many others. &quot;Totally boycott US goods! Sell all US treasury bonds!&quot; another wrote on the same day. We should not take the Chinese government&apos;s attitude toward the United States and the Obama administration for granted. It has not forgotten what most commentators in east Asia said during the presidential campaign about Obama and the Democratic party&apos;s protectionist inclinations. It knows that as the US emerges from financial crisis and reduces its financial dependence upon China, substantial trade disputes might raise their head again. The probability of Obama meeting with the Dalai Lama sooner or later, the possible new programme of arms sales to Taiwan, and the marginalisation of China in the North Korea problem all have the potential to make things worse. Normal relations between Beijing and Washington could soon be resumed, the honeymoon well and truly over."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/oct/06/breakfast-briefing", "publicationDate": "2009-10-06T05:00:00Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Email", "Hacking", "Spam", "Data and computer security", "Internet", "Technology"], "sentences": ["\u2022 We all know that spending too much time online can be unhealthy for anyone - but researchers in Taiwan have found that a number of conditions increase the likelihood of internet addiction among children."], "title": "Breakfast briefing: More on Hotmail attack, and internet addiction examined", "article": "\u2022 Some more details have emerged about the Hotmail attack that left thousands of users&apos; account details exposed online.

Frankly, it&apos;s astonishing: the most revealing, intimate and moving film about an orchestra I&apos;ve ever seen. Sure, there are some tics of the indulgent documentary-maker in the film \u2013 long, elegiac shots of luggage and jumbo-jets, night-vision footage of the orchestra&apos;s \u00fcber-musikers sleeping on long-haul flights, dramatic contrasts between Korean temples and concert halls, a gloomy soundtrack by Simon Stockhausen (Karlheinz&apos;s son), that sort of thing \u2013 but as an insight into the personalities that make up a great orchestra, the tensions that every player has to negotiate between being a starry soloist and a team player at the same time, Trip to Asia has no peers.\u00a0Grube and his team don&apos;t dwell on the relationship between the players and Rattle, which was under pressure at the time. Instead, they treat Sir Simon and his musicians in exactly the same way, extracting fascinating personal stories and philosophical reflections on what it&apos;s like to play in the Philharmoniker. Many of the players describe themselves as outsiders in their youths, social weirdos for whom music was both a private salvation and a means of communicating with the outside world. Rattle speaks brilliantly\u00a0about the two sides\u00a0to every musician, the hours of practice and isolation and, at the same time, the need for public approbation, the desire to be loved. But there&apos;s joy in this film, too, above all in Taiwan, where the whole orchestra gets a rock-star reception from a crowd of tens of thousands of music-lovers after their performance of Richard Strauss&apos;s Ein Heldenleben. There&apos;s some fantastic music-making as well, in the excerpts from Strauss, from Thomas Ad\u00e8s&apos;s Asyla and Beethoven&apos;s Eroica Symphony that Grube knits into his narrative.  By the end of the film, you feel you know Rattle and the players \u2013 all of them musical heroes whose lives are lived\u00a0with the greatest possible stress and intensity, but which are transcended in their music-making. Trip to Asia is the best possible corrective to the indignities that classical music often has to suffer on film and TV.

The price of the Dear Leader&apos;s compliance? The chance to talk directly to the Americans. &quot;Hostile relations [with] the US should be converted into peaceful ties through bilateral talks without fail,&quot; Kim said. The agreement represented a diplomatic coup for China after Pyongyang walked away from negotiations on its atomic weapons. It also advanced Barack Obama&apos;s global non-proliferation campaign. But perhaps its greatest significance was that in this case, as elsewhere, Beijing, not Washington, took the lead. By taking on the role of facilitator, China in effect took control. The US is having to get used to these manifestations of China&apos;s growing reach. Whether addressing climate change, achieving a &quot;balanced&quot; global economy and &quot;realistic&quot; exchange rates, or pursuing fair trade based on World Trade Organisation rules, Washington is increasingly beholden to Beijing&apos;s point of view. China is, after all, its largest creditor. And when it comes to geo-strategic issues such as Iran, Burma, Somali piracy or North Korean nukes, it is increasingly dependent on China&apos;s goodwill or, at least, its co-operation. Obama set the tone this year, stressing the desirability of pursuing a pragmatic global partnership. Speaking in February, secretary of state Hillary Clinton spelled out what that meant. Concerns about China&apos;s lamentable human rights record, for example, could not be allowed to &quot;interfere with [joint efforts to tackle] the global economic crisis, the global climate change crisis and the security crisis&quot;. But confirmation today that Obama has put off meeting the Dalai Lama until after his visit to China next month has reawakened fears that Washington is going too far in accommodating Beijing&apos;s interests, that its new policy of &quot;strategic reassurance&quot; comes at the cost of abandoning both friends and principles, and that in the end, the US will be the loser. The Tibetans have put on a brave face. But it&apos;s the first time in nearly two decades that the exiled Tibetan leader has been refused an audience, however informal, with the US president. And the snub undoubtedly creates a precedent other countries may follow. Critics of Obama&apos;s policy argue that when China&apos;s interests diverge from those of the US, it is much less obliging. Thus does its growing stake in Iran&apos;s oil and gas fields lead Beijing to oppose tougher UN sanctions on Tehran over its suspect nuclear programme. China has ignored western pleas to halt its construction of energy pipelines through Burma, cease arming Sri Lanka&apos;s repressive government, and stop investing in Sudan. Despite improved cross-straits relations, China&apos;s deployment of missiles aimed at Taiwan continues apace. Wen Liao of Longford Advisors, a Hong Kong consultancy, argued recently that China&apos;s rising world role was a positive development. Its &quot;new-found assertiveness&quot; could help create stability and prosperity in Asia and beyond. For example, China, disapproving (like the US) of Russia&apos;s &quot;dismemberment&quot; of Georgia last year, had successfully encouraged its central Asian allies to refuse to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger also believes in closer bilateral co-operation as &quot;the centre of gravity of international affairs&quot; shifts to Asia. &quot;It would be especially pernicious if opposing blocs were to form on each side of the Pacific,&quot; he said in a recent article. But Michael Lostumbo, a Rand Corporation analyst, warned that while China sometimes played a constructive international role, other unpredictable forces were at work in the People&apos;s Republic. They were responsible for the anti-Japanese riots of 2005 and continuing intolerance of minority groups such as the Tibetans and Uighurs \u2013 all products, in his view, of the &quot;extreme nationalism&quot; evident in an insecure country that worried its neighbours and yet still cast itself as a victim. China&apos;s rapid military build-up contradicted President Hu Jintao&apos;s boast at last month&apos;s UN general assembly that &quot;China has always been and will continue to be a positive force for world peace&quot;, Lostumbo suggested.

Backstory Born in Taiwan in 1947, Lin Hwai-min got hooked on dance at the age of five when he saw The Red Shoes. As a teenager, he was inspired by the American dancer and choreographer Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n. Discouraged from pursuing dance by his parents, he developed a talent for literature: he had his first novel published at 14, using the proceeds to pay for dance classes, and was a bestselling writer by the age of 23. After attending a writing course in America, he studied briefly at the Graham and Cunningham studios in New York. On his return to Taiwan in 1973, determined to develop a Taiwanese form of expression in dance, he founded Cloud Gate Dance Theatre, the country&apos;s first modern dance company.     Wild Cursive, the final chapter of Cursive: A Trilogy, at Sadler's Wells in 2007. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    His early pieces were fusions of modern dance with Chinese opera, acrobatics and folk dance. They dealt with mythological and historical Chinese and Taiwanese themes, sometimes explicitly engaging with contemporary Taiwanese society and politics. With Taiwan still under martial law, the pieces touched a nerve and were instant hits. But Lin struggled financially and closed the company in 1988. He then spent three years travelling through India, Indonesia, Europe and America. In 1991 he returned with renewed vigour and began to move away from his narrative style towards more meditative, image-based work, which proved as popular on the international stage as in Taiwan. Cloud Gate Dance Theatre is now one of Taiwan&apos;s most prominent cultural organisations, with a school and a youth company. In 2003, on its 30th anniversary, the street where the company is based was renamed Cloud Gate Lane and 21 August was designated &quot;Cloud Gate Day&quot;.  Watching Cloud Gate Dance Theatre Cloud Gate dancers study t&apos;ai chi, martial arts, meditation and calligraphy \u2013 and it shows. They move with the explosive force of martial arts and yet maintain the poise and flow of t&apos;ai chi and the quiet intensity of meditation. As Lin says, &quot;Instead of invading space, we now internalise our focus and discover a new world: our own bodies.&quot; Staging, design and lighting are as important as the dance. Lin&apos;s visuals tend to be simple yet striking: ink seeping through rice paper in Cursive, a flooded floor in Moon Water. The works are sometimes epic in scale: three tonnes of rice fall on to the floor in Songs of the Wanderers. Don&apos;t expect a lot of drive in Lin&apos;s works: the combination of stillness, scale and symbolism means that they are experiences to savour rather than stories to follow.      Making a splash ... Moon Water. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    Who&apos;s who Regular collaborators include lighting designer Chang Tsan-tao and set designers Lin Keh-hua and Austin MC Wang. Lo Man-fei, one of Lin&apos;s prized dancers, went on to become director of Cloud Gate 2, the youth, educational and outreach wing of the company. She died in 2006. Fact Lin relaunched Cloud Gate in 1991 after a conversation with a Taipei cab driver. Explaining to the taxi driver that running a dance company was too hard, he was told: &quot;Every profession has its hard spots. Driving a cab in the traffic of the city is not easy!&quot; He thought, &quot;My God, if this is so important to people, even to the cab drivers, well, I think I&apos;d better pick up and get my act together. And so I came back.&quot; In his own words &quot;We set out to create works of our own, not imitations of American or European modern dance. As to how, I didn&apos;t know, and had to spend the next 30 years looking for an answer ... Dance critics in Europe acclaim that Cloud Gate has created a new dance language. In fact, we just happily found ourselves.&quot; Address to the International Society for the Performing Arts in 2006 &quot;Dance is an exchange, a dialogue of energy. A Cloud Gate performance becomes so intense because everyone breathes together. The audience is unconsciously seduced, invited, involved in what&apos;s going on.&quot; Interview with Caroline Gluck, New York Times, 2005 In other words &quot;Lin Hwai-min is rightly known as one of dance&apos;s natural linguists \u2013 his vocabulary switching between martial arts and ballet, modern dance and Beijing opera.

It wasn&apos;t half as sexy, hi-tech or awe-inspiring as I might once have hoped, but there was a certain gritty positivism about the experience that made it feel more real than any science-fiction fantasy. The setting was a Buddhist recycling centre on the outskirts of Taipei, where elderly volunteers were purifying their minds (or in some cases, just passing the time of day) by unscrewing tops and peeling off labels from a mountain of discarded plastic bottles. Sorted by colour so the plastic could be broken down, granulated and reused, the bottles were destined for reincarnation as soft blue polyester blankets. In a separate workroom, another rank of volunteers on sewing machines hemmed the material, ironed on the logo of the Buddhist charity Tzu Chi, and folded them ready for free distribution to disaster victims and the homeless. And that&apos;s it. Not a very euphoric revelation, I grant you. But it struck me that Tzu Chi \u2013 an organisation I had never heard of until last week \u2013 were riding three of the biggest waves of the 21st century. The first was the ageing of wealthy societies. Taiwan is in the world&apos;s grey frontline, along with Japan, Hong Kong, Macau and several countries in Europe that are trying to find new ways to keep their elderly populations active, occupied and socially useful. The old people sorting through the trash near Taipei were from middle-class families. They said they did so for the exercise, for the company and because it was more constructive than sitting at home alone watching TV. The second was the growing importance of recycling as the world&apos;s nonrenewable resources run down. Taipei city has one of the highest recycling rates on the planet. The rules are so strict that some city residents plan their social lives around rubbish truck schedules. Even McDonald&apos;s has separate bins. Chiau Wen-Yan, deputy minister of environmental protection, told me the recycling policy was now so successful it was creating a welcome problem of incinerators not having enough to burn. On this crowded island, the practice is not just socially responsible, it&apos;s becoming semi-religious. Tzu Chi \u2013 with 50,000, mostly retired, recycling volunteers \u2013 is one of three Buddhist groups that picks up members along with the rubbish. The third was the growing need to prepare for disaster. If the climate specialists are right, storms and floods will become more frequent and intense. This summer, Tzu Chi handed out 60,000 recycled plastic blankets to the survivors of Typhoon Morakot, the biggest downpour in Taiwan&apos;s history, which killed more than 500 people. People expected more disasters on this scale in the future, the vice minister of economic affairs, Huang Jung-Chiou, told me. It turned out he too was a Tzu Chi member, who was vegetarian on Mondays and volunteered for rubbish recycling even after taking office. &quot;It was an important experience,&quot; he said. &quot;Peeling the labels off bottles was extremely boring, but it made me think &apos;Look at all that garbage. Who produced it?&apos;&quot; I don&apos;t know enough about Tzu Chi to endorse them, but their bottles-to-blankets activity seems a grittier form of the recycling done by charity shops in the UK. It is not exactly how I hope to spend my retirement, but facing up to absurd amounts of waste is probably what we will all have to do a lot more of in the future."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/13/skyscrapers-signal-downturn", "publicationDate": "2009-10-12T23:05:10Z", "tags": ["Architecture", "Recession", "Empire State Building, New York, US", "Dubai"], "sentences": ["Standing over 800 metres high, it will be at least 290 metres taller than its nearest competitor, the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan."], "title": "When skyscrapers signal a downturn", "article": "It&apos;s surprisingly hard to decide on the tallest building in the world. Architects are much like Hollywood stars in their tendency to try to add a couple of sneaky inches. The people at the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, who adjudicate on these matters, have had to ban all kinds of Cuban-heel equivalents, from enormous radio masts to metal &quot;guy-ropes&quot; holding up towers that would otherwise collapse in strong winds. However, their job has got easier with the construction of the Burj Dubai. When it&apos;s finished in December, it will take the &quot;world&apos;s tallest building&quot; crown simply by dint of being really big. Standing over 800 metres high, it will be at least 290 metres taller than its nearest competitor, the Taipei 101 building in Taiwan. Its success, though, may be tarnished by the fact that it arrives in a very different world to that in which it was conceived. The property market in Dubai has plummeted and we&apos;re still stuck in the economic winter. This won&apos;t have surprised analyst Andrew Lawrence. In 1999 the research director at investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein invented something called the &quot;Skyscraper index&quot;, arguing that the construction of super-tall buildings is often a sign that an economic downturn is on the way. The best example is the late 1920s, which saw an unprecedented skyscraper boom prior to the Great Depression. The Empire State Building, which was finished in 1929, didn&apos;t achieve full occupancy for 40 years. Other examples include the Sears Tower in Chicago, finished in time for the Oil Crisis of 1974, and the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, which appeared after the Malaysian stockmarket went down the plughole in 1997. By the time Canary Wharf was finished in 1991, the London commercial property market was in recession; and the slower pace of building in Britain means our next record-breaking white elephant, the Shard Of Glass in London&apos;s Southwark, won&apos;t be completed until 2012. Skyscrapers, then, are the physical embodiment of &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the markets. The rule is that if there&apos;s enough money sloshing around to pay for one, then don&apos;t be surprised if, by the time the purple ribbon&apos;s cut, the scissors have to be on hire purchase."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/oct/14/corrections-clarifications", "publicationDate": "2009-10-13T23:05:15Z", "tags": [], "sentences": ["\u2022\u2008We reported that a number of people with haemophilia in Taiwan and Hong Kong had won permission to sue Bayer in pursuit of claims that these people contracted HIV from contaminated blood products allegedly dumped in Asia by a company that Bayer now owns (Haemophilia patients can sue drug giant in US over HIV claims, 12 October, page 19).", "What our story should have said is that Taiwanese haemophilia patients are now appealing against this decision."], "title": "Corrections and clarifications", "article": "\u2022\u2008We reported that a number of people with haemophilia in Taiwan and Hong Kong had won permission to sue Bayer in pursuit of claims that these people contracted HIV from contaminated blood products allegedly dumped in Asia by a company that Bayer now owns (Haemophilia patients can sue drug giant in US over HIV claims, 12 October, page 19).

Bankers are not Mother Theresa. Over the past year taxpayers have given them half a trillion pounds in cash, loans, shares, lucre, dosh, quantitative easing, whatever, with not a string or condition attached. We knew, or at least some of us did, what they would do next. They would not give the money back. They would certainly not lend it to collapsing manufacturers or high street retailers, whom the government had refused to help. Instead they would pay off the gambling debts they had run up from money previously entrusted to them by the public as depositors. They would spend the rest on bonuses, houses, Porsches, yachts, brothels (says the Guardian), Cotswolds farms, commodity shares, bonuses, bonuses and yet more bonuses. After a while, you just cannot get rid of the bloody stuff. So who is the bigger fool, the bankers or the rest of us? Over the past year we have doled out what the Economist estimates as &quot;the biggest peacetime fiscal expansion in history&quot;. A little was taken off VAT, but every other brass farthing went to a banker, with not a jot of regulation to control how it was disbursed. Ministers certainly pleaded. Brown said last October that &quot;the heart of the problem of averting recession&quot; lay in ensuring that bank lending to the private sector was sustained. The objective was clear. Not a week passed without Alistair Darling insisting, cajoling, begging, threatening and stamping his foot. Lending was the be all and end all of his subsidies. His officials phoned banks daily to plead for more lending. They refused. Lending to a crashing private sector is hardly wise, especially with interest rates plummeting. Shopping streets and centres became like bombsites. Unemployment soared. Money in circulation stuttered to a halt. As the economist Tim Congdon pointed out, Darling&apos;s action in October 2008 &quot;did not protect against a recession. On the contrary, it accelerated and intensified its onset&quot;. The requirement of both Keynesianism and monetarism, that demand somehow be stimulated in a recession, was denied by a chancellor who deflated as ruthlessly as had Thatcher in 1980-81. By the end of this summer, the Bank of England reported &quot;net flow of lending to businesses&quot; falling faster than ever since records began, indeed by \u00a315bn in July alone. Taxpayers&apos; money was being locked up in bank balance sheets. When Britain should have been spending, it was forced to save. This explains the eccentric financial news. Indicators for output, trade and employment remain gloomy while those for shares, houses and commodity futures are booming. Banks suddenly have lots of money \u2013 our money \u2013 and\u00a0nothing to do with it but speculate, this\u00a0time under the cover of an implicit government. While personal incomes are relatively static, returns to gambling\u00a0are soaring. That is why bankers are making such large bonuses, with no one to stop them. As if to reward them, the government is this week planning to give Lloyds another tranche of \u00a35bn to underpin its balance sheet. None of this will leak into demand. It will be hoarded to cover bad losses. It is hard to think of a policy fashioned by so few that has cost so much to so many. It is plain daft. Throughout the past year there has been not a whiff of remorse, let alone a change in policy. Downing Street has appeared baffled. Advisers are said to be\u00a0at a loss to explain why pleas to banks\u00a0from the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England have fallen on deaf ears. They pondered the Vince Cable option of nationalising domestic deposits and leaving so-called investment banking to default \u2013 but could not think how to do it. They pondered the &quot;helicopter option&quot;, employed in China and Taiwan to good effect, of showering money not on banks but directly on consumer demand through vouchers, tax cuts or make-work schemes. To Britain it seemed populist and crude, except when directed at the car industry. Quite\u00a0why cars were considered good demand but other forms of consumption bad was never explained. Nothing was explained. It was merely asserted as axiomatic that banks should not fail. The lack was not of political courage but of ideology and intellect. The idea of nationalising and deconstructing a bank, though it was done de facto in the war and in other countries, seemed beyond the tolerance of a Labour government. Saving private deposits \u2013 guarding the cash machines \u2013 but letting the spiv side of a bank go bust, offended a prime minister who had spent much of his time in office courting spivs. Instead, a gigantic fudge was concocted, that rescuing a bankrupt bank was the way to rescue the entire economy. Subsidies would trickle down from the greedy to the needy. The American financial guru, Pippa Malmgren, reflected on the Today programme yesterday that it was hard to imagine the financial world would really be a worse place today if a few dud banks had been left to fail. Their asset base would at least be unencumbered with bad debt, and public money would not be guaranteeing rubbish. Meanwhile the mind can only boggle at the debt burden now saddling taxpayers for the rest of their lives. Why did the government not support demand when the economy entered recession? Why did it bail out banks and car firms but not Woolworths, white goods, the DIY sector, hair salons, hotels, restaurants \u2013 anywhere that kept people in work? Why did it not give money to pensioners and the poor, who for sure would not do what banks do and merely save? Students of the Watergate school of journalism were taught one lesson: &quot;Just follow the money.&quot; It was Deep Throat&apos;s one message to the Washington Post reporters from the depths of his underground car park. I have long followed this maxim, especially since first trying to understand the credit crunch last year. What motivated those in charge of Britain&apos;s financial policy? Why were they so obsessed with saving bankers and nobody else? The answer must lie in their personal circumstance. Those advising Brown and Darling in Downing Street, such as Lord Myners, Lady Vadera, Lord Turner and John Kingman, were all past or present bankers, or friends of bankers. When they leave public life they are likely to work for a bank. They are the castlist of David Hare&apos;s admonitory dialogue, The Power of Yes, at the National Theatre. To them, City banking is like the apostolic succession to the Vatican, or the Royal Navy to Churchill. It is the defining institution of the state. Economic policy in the 1970s was directed at saving steel, coal, cars and ships. It is now directed at banks. Without a shred of evidence or justification, they are asserted to be too big to fail. For this indulgence, the British people are now to pay an enormous price. At the end of a year that has seen a prosperous economy brought to its knees, there has been no ministerial apology, no political resignation, no court case, not so much as an inquest. We have only spin doctors combing the landscape looking for green shoots. They are there, but only in a few well-padded back pockets."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/21/subcontinent-man-asian-literary-prize", "publicationDate": "2009-10-21T14:33:56Z", "tags": ["Man Asian literary prize", "Fiction", "Awards and prizes", "Books", "Culture"], "sentences": ["Authors from Bhutan, Mongolia and Myanmar as well as from Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan also submitted work for the prize, which will announce its winner on 16 November in Hong Kong."], "title": "Indian subcontinent dominates Man Asian literary prize shortlist", "article": "The final for this year&apos;s Man Asian literary prize is dominated by writers from the Indian subcontinent.

The playboy, ashamed of his previous lifestyle, has already castrated himself. The list is completed with The Descartes Highlands by Manila-born Eric Gamalinda, a novelist and poet who now teaches at Columbia University in the US. The book tells the story of a woman who buys a baby in Manila. Irish novelist Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, who is chairing the judging panel, praised the wide scope of the shortlist. &quot;The variety of ways in which voice and tone was used in these novels, the sense of commitment to story, the range in the methods of exploring both self and society, the interest in experimenting and making it new, made the time spent judging this prize rewarding and enlightening,&quot; he said. The three-year-old prize, previously won by Chinese author Jiang Rong&apos;s Wolf Totem and Filipino writer Miguel Syjuco&apos;s Ilustrado, has met controversy in the past over its definition of Asian. This includes 25 countries, from Mongolia to North Korea and Afghanistan, but fails to encompass the likes of Turkey, Iran or any of the &apos;Stans. This year T\u00f3ib\u00edn and his fellow judges, the Chinese-American author Gish Jen and the Indian writer Pankaj Mishra, received 150 submissions, with the most coming from India, followed by the Philippines and Hong Kong. Authors from Bhutan, Mongolia and Myanmar as well as from Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Pakistan also submitted work for the prize, which will announce its winner on 16 November in Hong Kong.

But over the last several months, Beijing has done enough to shatter every hope of peace in Asia. It began with an unprecedented attempt by Beijing in March this year to block a $2.9bn Asian Development Bank loan to India on the grounds that some of the cash was intended for use in the eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, a region China claims as its own. This was followed by a gratuitous broadside against India in the People&apos;s Daily, the Communist party&apos;s mouthpiece. Military incursions into India by Chinese forces were backed up by Beijing&apos;s diplomatic assault on India&apos;s territorial integrity and pluralistic nationalism: the Chinese embassy in New Delhi began issuing irregular visas to Kashmiri Indians in an effort to legitimise separatism. And last week, Beijing officially condemned prime minister Manmohan Singh&apos;s visit to Arunachal Pradesh. Officially, India maintains that it is on good terms with Beijing. China&apos;s outrageous provocations manage only to elicit &quot;disappointment&quot; in New Delhi. This week, Dr Singh will even meet with his Chinese counterpart, Wen Jiabao, on the sidelines of the Asean summit in Thailand; warm words about friendship will be exchanged. But platitudes can no longer conceal the fact that China is strangulating India. Using a combination of aid and ammunition, Beijing has drawn a hostile circle of influence around India: beginning in Pakistan (to which Beijing supplied nuclear technology) in the north-west, it runs through Nepal (to which it exported Maoism) and Burma (where it shields a dictatorship) in the east, ending in Sri Lanka (where it armed a genocidal state) in the south. Two reasons account for China&apos;s obsession with India. The first is historical: China crawled on to the world stage on India&apos;s back. India not only became the second non-communist country in the world to bestow recognition on Mao&apos;s pariah state; it was also, in Nehru&apos;s words, the most passionate pleader of China&apos;s &quot;cause in the councils of the world&quot;. When President Eisenhower offered India the UN security council seat held by Taiwan, Nehru, ever the idealist, turned it down, urging the US to offer it to China instead. But soon, Beijing developed the arriviste&apos;s disdain for its most forceful supporter. Mao could not abide an Asia with multiple centres of power. New Delhi&apos;s decision to grant asylum to the Dalai Lama in defiance of Beijing&apos;s bullying confirmed India as a contender. China initiated a surprise multi-pronged attack on India in 1962, occupying a substantial portion of contested territory on the Tibetan plateau. Beijing retreated just as American jumbo jets, flown to aid India&apos;s assault, began landing in West Bengal. Today, Beijing actively aligns itself with India where its interests are involved \u2013 on climate change, for instance \u2013 but on a bilateral level, it views India as inconvenient competition. The second reason goes to the heart of China&apos;s current condition. Western observers of Beijing, enraptured by the glitz of China, have long stopped examining the decay of the party that runs it. Many in the west still argue that China&apos;s economic prosperity is a precursor to political freedom for its people. But this theory, as Minxin Pei has argued, ignores the important fact that an authoritarian state is less likely to loosen its grip on a wealthy country than it would be to forego the control of an impoverished one. Last month&apos;s celebrations in Beijing bore out Pei&apos;s point: so insecure was the Communist party that, as Gordon Chang reported, a security force more than a million strong force was put in place to keep ordinary people away from the celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the &quot;People&apos;s Republic&quot;; hotel rooms overlooking the procession were booked by the government; and residents in nearby houses were barred from looking out of their windows. Chinese nationalism is a genie that serves the state. With such a fragile hold on the country, the Communist party has to invoke monsters in order to rally support. Japan has been the traditional target, but today&apos;s India vexes Beijing even more. If India can guarantee fundamental rights to its diverse citizens while managing a growth rate not far from China&apos;s \u2013 and more than make up for the low numbers with a free press, regular elections, and independent institutions \u2013 why, someone is bound to ask, can China not do the same? In the coming months and years, Beijing is going to become even more aggressive with India. New Delhi must now discard the myth of China&apos;s invincibility that has led it into appeasement, and devise a definitive China policy featuring at least three elements. First, India should continue fortifying its side of the border with China by upgrading infrastructure, deploying troops, setting up air bases; New Delhi must yield to the overwhelming patriotic sentiment in Arunachal Pradesh and allow the formation of a local military regiment. Second, India must deepen its engagement with Australia and Japan, broaden its military exercises with the US, and build active alliances with south-east Asian countries wary of China. Finally, India must allow the &quot;Dalai clique&quot; to engage in political activity. It makes no sense for New Delhi to suppress Tibetan protesters in order to mollify an expansionist monster that has sponsored anti-India insurgencies for at least 50 years. Tibet&apos;s restive population is a time bomb whose detonator, the Dalai Lama, is with India. New Delhi must stop gagging His Holiness. The Sino-Indian conflict will define the 21st century in a more complicated manner than the Soviet-American conflict characterised the second half of the 20th. So far, this clash has received very little attention in the west. In the not-too-distant future, people everywhere are going to have to pick sides. The troubled peace of today is necessarily a prelude to the impending war."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/26/noriko-sakai-drugs-court-japan", "publicationDate": "2009-10-26T15:11:45Z", "tags": ["Japan", "Pop and rock", "Drugs trade", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["Sakai&apos;s brand of saccharine pop made her a household name in the 1990s and earned her a huge following in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong."], "title": "Drugs confession of pop idol draws 6,600 to Tokyo court", "article": "The chances of success stood at roughly one in 300. But even those odds weren&apos;t enough to stop thousands of people from braving heavy rain in Tokyo today for the chance to see one of Japan&apos;s best-known celebrities take the stand on drugs charges. The case against Noriko Sakai has gripped Japan ever since the 38-year-old actress and singer went into hiding in early August, on the day she was called in for questioning after the drugs-related arrest of her husband. Tabloid tales of the couple&apos;s amphetamine use have been lapped up by an enraptured public in a country where celebrity drug use still counts as a genuine scandal. Today, 6,600 people lined up for the 20 seats in the public gallery at the Tokyo district court, a number topped only by the 12,000 who applied for a place at the opening day in the trial of Shoko Asahara, the cult guru whose followers carried out a fatal gas attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. Sakai&apos;s brand of saccharine pop made her a household name in the 1990s and earned her a huge following in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. She was arrested for allegedly using amphetamines during a family holiday in July; investigators also found minute traces of the drug in her Tokyo apartment. Dressed in a black suit and clutching a white handkerchief, Sakai admitted the charges and said she had been persuaded to take drugs by her husband, Yuichi Takaso, who describes himself as a professional surfer. His arrest prompted her to disappear for several days, prompting a hunt that at times seemed to be led by the media rather than the police. Prosecutors are seeking an 18-month jail term for a crime that carries a maximum sentence of 10 years, although most first-time offenders get off with a suspended sentence. Whether she serves time in prison, Sakai, who appeared in an anti-drugs campaign in the early 1990s, has been amply castigated by an unforgiving entertainment world. The media have characterised her alleged drug habit as a betrayal to the legions of fans drawn to her wholesome image as a twentysomething pop idol and, more recently, by her devotion to her 10-year-old son. Toyota stopped showing a commercial featuring Sakai on its website and her clothing line was pulled from stores across Japan. She was later ditched by her agency, Sun Music, and Victor Records withdrew her CDs from stores. In what appeared to be a plea for leniency, she tearfully told the court she would divorce her husband and swap showbusiness for a career in geriatric nursing. A ruling is due on 9 November."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/oct/27/economy-recession-car-industry-bankers", "publicationDate": "2009-10-27T22:29:00Z", "tags": ["Politics", "Alistair Darling", "US domestic policy", "US economy", "US news", "Recession", "China", "Germany", "Economic policy", "Peter Mandelson", "Europe", "Asia Pacific", "Business"], "sentences": ["In Taiwan, a $108 coupon was issued to every citizen to spend on goods or services before the year&apos;s end."], "title": "These snobs are blind to the one economic policy that works | Simon Jenkins", "article": "Guess what? Britain has an economic policy that works, one that is small but perfectly formed. It is not the \u00a3175bn that the chancellor, Alistair Darling, has hurled at banks, apparently with no effect whatsoever. It is the paltry \u00a3400m that Lord Mandelson has spent on his car scrappage scheme. Throughout last winter, Gordon Brown was telling car makers that they were on their own for the duration of the recession. This was despite scrappage programmes on the continent that had a million German drivers besieging showrooms and rescuing Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes from collapse. Then in May, Mandelson won his battle with the Treasury and the Bank of England and introduced his own scheme, a \u00a32,000 allowance on each old\u00a0car traded in for a new one. The scheme quickly spent the \u00a3300m allocated and Mandelson has extended it by \u00a3100m into 2010. The impact was dramatic. In March and April, the car industry had been a basket case. Sales were down a third on\u00a0the year. Honda at Swindon had closed completely and there were layoffs and bankruptcies on all sides. The economy contracted by 2.5% in the\u00a0first quarter of 2009 and policymakers seemed trapped in the headlights, mindlessly turfing money at banks and nothing else. From May car sales recovered, and by August the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders was reporting a 6% rise in sales on the same month last year, and by September, 11%. The newly bought cars were on the whole smaller, safer and emitted 10% less CO2 than the average. With two thirds of Britain&apos;s car output exported and European scrappage schemes now dwindling, this recovery remains tentative. But it has clearly assisted a tiny corner of manufacturing industry through the depth of recession and averted the cost of mass layoffs. Why just cars? Why is there no scrappage scheme for other consumer goods, such as cookers, fridges, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, non-digital TVs, anything made or assembled in Britain? What about a short-term subsidy to encourage insulated loft conversion? My chairs, curtains, plumbing and garden shed could do with scrappage, not to mention my wardrobe. These are mostly British products and all sustain British jobs. The issue is not the worthiness of the spending, but the spending itself. Every other country has recognised this, and is reaping the benefit in economic revival. Germany&apos;s car scrappage scheme, at \u20ac5bn, was 10 times the size of Britain&apos;s and delivered 10 times the reflationary punch. America&apos;s &quot;cash for clunkers&quot; consumed $3bn and is reckoned to have rescued Ford, Chrysler and General Motors from what had been near-bankruptcy in March. Motor shares have shot from an average $2 to $11 in six months. This is being followed by $300m given to state governments for trade-ins of fridges, dishwashers and washing machines. A short-term $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers has led an instant recovery in house prices. Meanwhile China has thrown $360bn at demand, with vouchers for cars, fridges, hotels and restaurants handed out by local authorities. Chinese car sales rose 24% after the introduction of the scheme in May. Japan handed out spending vouchers of $130 per adult. Thailand did likewise. In Taiwan, a $108 coupon was issued to every citizen to spend on goods or services before the year&apos;s end. The island&apos;s president recently declared that the $2.5bn scheme had saved 50,000 retailing jobs. That is one per cent of what the British government has spent saving no jobs at all, except possibly in banks. British economists deride such demand stimulus for being short-term in effect and for merely replacing other spending. But the essence of demand maintenance is to be short term, to ride out Keynes&apos;s &quot;liquidity trap&quot; when consumers slash outgoings because of a collapse in confidence. Nor do the handouts appear to have boosted savings abroad. This week&apos;s statistics confirm that a recovery is under way in all major eastern and western economies \u2013 including the rest of Europe. Yet it remains stubbornly absent in Britain. Output is still falling, by 0.4% between July and September. This must in large part be due to different government policies. Unlike countries that have poured money into consumer demand and public projects, Britain has preferred to give its money to banks, either to redeem debt or in the hope that some of it trickles through to the general economy. It has not done so. All that has happened is that bank debt has been converted into taxpayer debt, to the tune of \u00a33,000 a head. A recent survey of 700 town centres found 10% of shops and pubs have now closed, including 11% of florists and 13% of bookshops. These firms are beyond needing any credit. It was customers they wanted, and customers that Brown and Darling denied them. I can find only one reason why British policymakers are so obsessed with banks among all commercial institutions, and for me it is a strange one. It has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with class. Cars are favoured as they have long been a political erogenous zone. Mandelson will travel the world to save Vauxhall as he would never do for tourism or catering, much bigger employers and export earners. Otherwise, policymakers are snobs. They are contemptuous of production and consumption alike. They never visit\u00a0factories or high streets. Ministers and their advisers enjoy the company of\u00a0bankers and exchange jobs with them. That is why every political pronouncement, from all parties, during the recession has not been about demand but about credit. Credit is toff economics, demand is for proles. The Tories&apos; George Osborne has a fixation with boosting credit, oblivious that credit unsustained by demand is merely bad debt. The chancellor claims that the unique depth of Britain&apos;s recession is &quot;the more reason to continue the action the government has taken&quot;. Surely the opposite is the case. Darling is like a Great War general reeling punchdrunk from the horrors of the Somme, unable to recognise a strategy that has failed. He is blind to alternatives. He no longer cares that his policy does not work \u2013 so long as he can find a banker&apos;s shoulder on which to cry."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/28/ang-lee-life-of-pi", "publicationDate": "2009-10-28T13:41:12Z", "tags": ["Ang Lee", "Yann Martel", "Film", "Booker prize", "Books", "Culture", "Fiction", "Life of Pi", "Life of Pi"], "sentences": ["The Taiwan-born director&apos;s next movie in UK cinemas will be Taking Woodstock, his comedy-drama about the 1969 music festival, which premiered in May to lukewarm reviews at Cannes."], "title": "Ang Lee boards Life of Pi film", "article": "It has been stuck in development hell for much of the past decade, but the big-screen version of Yann Martel&apos;s 2002 Man Booker prize-winning novel Life of Pi finally looks set to go into production after the Oscar-winning film-maker Ang Lee confirmed it will be his next film.

The current energy efficiency standard for switching power supplies on laptop computers is 87%, though many firms fit devices that fall well below this level. Delta says its best equipment could reach 93% for $1 or $2 more.

A raucous family in the same cemetery remembers their dead relative with alcohol, chilaquiles and song. A three-year-old excitedly carries a sugar skull to his kindergarten where he will proudly put it on the school altar. A\u00a0protest group sets up an altogether more sombre version outside a government office to demand justice for murdered young girls. Mexico&apos;s El D\u00eda de Muertos is colourful, poignant, mystical, political, contradictory, satirical, macabre and rather childish \u2013 all at the same time. The classic place to immerse yourself in Mexico&apos;s Day of the Dead are the islands in Lake P\u00e1tzcuaro in the central state of Michoac\u00e1n, populated by indigenous Pur\u00e9pecha. The mist from the lake mingles with the mysticism of the indigenous culture to produce a particularly intense experience. But finding a place to stay can be a nightmare, and to get away from tourist trinkets you have to get yourself to the most remote islands. Perhaps the purest sense of the celebration&apos;s pre-hispanic roots requires a trip to the Mayan town of Pomuch in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, where relatives exhume the bones of dead loved ones to give them a brush up for the year to come. While the prize for the most aesthetic celebration may well belong to the city of Oaxaca, long renowned for the quality of its local artists who use coloured sawdust in extraordinarily intricate altars set up on pavements. But of all the many options available you can do a lot worse than choose the easiest of all: Mexico City. It may not sound very exotic, but it does drive home just how adept the D\u00eda de Muertos (which is really two days, sometimes more) is at reinventing itself for each new era and remaining at the centre of Mexican popular culture. The origins of the festival stretch back to the different ancient Mesoamerican cultures who lived in the area but shared a fascination with death. None more intensely than the Aztecs who dominated central Mexico for centuries, and held a specific fiesta for the dead in the middle of the year that the Spanish colonial powers moved to coincide with the Catholic holiday of All Saints&apos; Day on 2 November. At the core of the celebration are the ofrendas, or altars, which are said to guide the spirits of the departed back to Earth for a brief sojourn among the company of those they left behind. For a feel of how much preparation goes into them, pop into a market from the last week of October until the spirits go back where they came from on 2 November. Any market will do, outside the business districts, from the historic centre to the southern barrio of Coyoac\u00e1n. There you will see locals struggling under the weight of huge bunches of bright orange cempaz\u00fachitl flowers (local marigolds) and a very smelly bright purple flower, that act as beckoning beacons. Then there are the piles of pan de muerto, a sweet round decorated bread that provides the spirits with sustenance when they&apos;ve found their way. Most of the stalls are dedicated to the more humorous side of the whole endeavour that became a key element of the urban celebration in the 20th century. There will be models of skeletons getting drunk in cantinas, sculptures of ornately clad female versions, and sugar skulls with space to write your name on the forehead in coloured icing. There is a lot of Halloween paraphernalia, too. But rather than smothering local traditions it has simply been incorporated into the general cacophony, rather like the Catholic theme imposed by the conquistadors who ensured it all happened around All Saints&apos; Day. Public ofrendas are easy to find in Mexico City, beginning with those laid out in the great Z\u00f3calo (plaza) in the centre of town. But my favourite is the Muertos exhibition at the Dolores Olmedo museum in the far south of the capital. The central theme changes each year. In 2008 it was icons from the golden age of Mexican cinema \u2013 represented in skeletal form. Set up by one of the main patrons of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, the museum also has an impressive permanent collection of their works set in grounds where peacocks roam and xoloitzcuintli (hairless dogs) pose. For me, the highlight of being in Mexico City on the night of 1 November (the heart of the ceremony) is the chance to drive about another 30 minutes down the road and spend a couple of hours or so in the cemetery in San Gregorio Atlapulco, Xochimilco, on the semi-rural edge of the city. Stretching up from the edge of what remains of the lake system that once filled the Valley of Mexico, many residents still farm the artificial islets known as chinampas that were the basis of Mesoamerican agriculture in the area. Definitely worth a wander around if you get there before dark. Activity in the cemetery itself doesn&apos;t really get going until well after dark, but it is worth the wait to see how this traditional community still within the confines of the metropolis fondly remembers its dead. By midnight, it is literally buzzing with activity as families arrive laden with brooms, buckets, flowers, candles and everything else they need to set up their ofrendas on top of the graves. Each is different, and some are stunningly creative. The collective result is both beautiful and rather otherworldly, without being overly solemn. Some families sit around eating and drinking tequila, chatting about the departed and singing their favourite songs. Minstrels and mariachi bands wander along the paths offering a more professional rendition for a fee. Children play between the graves and the elderly sit wrapped up in heavy blankets preparing to wait the night through. If you speak Spanish, most people are happy to tell you about their dead and their traditions, although there are also those deep in silent thought and more melancholy tributes who obviously want to be left alone. The cemetery is open to anybody who wants to go, and I have never seen any sign of irritation with strangers taking photographs although it is advisable to discretely ask permission before taking closer shots. The first time I went, in 2000, there were no other outsiders. The last time, in 2008, I spotted several other foreigners wandering around with cameras. But the cemetery is a long way from being overrun, unlike the much more famous village of Mixquic further down the road. When you eventually draw yourself away, look back as you drive off towards the concrete jungle to see the orange glow above the cemetery fade into the black night. \u2022 To get to Xochimilco and San Gregorio the best option is to hire a car for the day, or hire a taxi by the hour and ask the driver to wait.

His life spanned nearly a century, from the final few days of the Qing Dynasty, through the Republican period, from 1912 to 1949, and on to the 60th anniversary of the People&apos;s Republic of China (PRC). It also embodied the conflicts between the US and China, the two countries where he was to be based most of his life, and between which he was forced, finally, to choose. Qian was the son of a government official, born in the city of Hangzhou in the coastal province of Zhejiang. He was educated at Shanghai Jiaotong University, and, in 1935, with the help of a scholarship, went first to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US, and then, a year later, to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he was to be awarded his doctorate, and be based for the next two decades. It was while in California, during the second world war, that his research concentrated on jet propulsion. With a number of other key US scientists, responding to the German V1 and V2 rockets, he devised a range of highly effective missiles, which proved crucial in the final stages of the war effort. Qian also participated in the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb. As a result of this, he was made the first director of the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Centre at Caltech in 1949. In the same year, however, the communists won their final push to become rulers of the PRC, exiling the Nationalist leadership under Chiang Kai-shek, whom the US had largely supported, to the island of Taiwan. Qian was immediately suspected of being a communist sympathiser, with claims being made that his name had appeared on Communist party documents as early as the late 1930s. His application for US citizenship was subsequently denied, and he was detained after applying to leave America. One US official at the time called this the &quot;stupidest thing this country ever did&quot;. In 1955, Qian was allowed to return to China. The US&apos;s loss (one of Qian&apos;s colleagues in the 1930s had called Qian a scientist of genius) was China&apos;s gain, at a critical period in its development. Qian was immediately allowed to establish an Institute of Mechanics in Beijing, and to work within the state-established Chinese Academy of Science. His skills and knowledge were absolutely critical at a time when many of China&apos;s most talented scientists had refused to return home because of the political changes that had taken place there. A symbol of the respect and trust Qian enjoyed was his admission to the Communist party in 1958. He started work on what was to become the Dongfeng missile. As a result both of his work, and of support from the Soviet Union (despite the fact that relations between these two countries had deteriorated badly in the late 1950s), China was able to test its own atomic bomb in 1963-64. A mere 15 years after its founding, it had joined the elite nuclear club. This was a seminal moment in the country&apos;s development. Qian seems to have been largely unaffected by the tumult of the Cultural Revolution, from 1966, probably because he was working in such a key national strategic area. While chaos reigned in the rest of China, military and technical research continued unaffected. In 2009, as China is preparing to build a space exploration launch pad on the island of Hainan, and has set itself the aim of getting a Chinese man on the moon in the next decade, Qian&apos;s contribution to China&apos;s space and missile programme should not be underestimated. Much of the technology behind the Shenzhou rockets, launched into space from the 1990s onwards to much national fanfare, can be traced back to research that Qian undertook. And much of that was based on what he had studied in the US during his 20 years there. After his retirement in 1991, he maintained a low profile, despite being garlanded with awards. He is survived by his wife, the highly acclaimed Beijing opera singer Jiang Ying. \u2022 Qian Xuesen, rocket scientist, born 11 December 1911; died 31 October 2009 \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2009.

It was therefore brave of Scott Taunton, head of TalkSport&apos;s parent, UTV Radio GB, to break ranks by speaking out in an interview in last week&apos;s MediaGuardian. Like the little boy who noticed the emperor had no clothes, Taunton pointed out the obvious about the industry&apos;s desire to move to DAB digital radio and switch off FM in six years, as outlined in Lord Carter&apos;s Digital Britain report: &quot;I don&apos;t think there is anyone who genuinely believes 2015 is realistic,&quot; he said. Worse, he pointed out that moving to the more efficient DAB+ system (more stations, better sound, lower transmission costs) had the problem that almost all the DAB sets in UK homes can&apos;t receive it. &quot;The future at the moment is FM,&quot; he said. &quot;The next generation is about iPhones with FM receivers.&quot; Taunton is obviously not the first to point to these problems. What makes it shocking is that he represents a leading industry company that has invested in DAB \u2013 not some minor commercial broadcaster, analyst or journalist. So is this a trend? Will other broadcasters follow UTV&apos;s lead or will they close ranks? Was Taunton flying a kite, or was it the fallout from a personality clash? UTV has quit the industry body, RadioCentre, making its displeasure plain. The worst case scenario \u2013 probably discussed around the watercoolers \u2013 is that the radio industry wants to change course. With the decline in commercial radio revenues and the BBC under increasing pressure, perhaps the investment Carter requires in expanding digital radio coverage is no longer worth the concessions on offer. But while the chitchat continues, the global radio industry is heading for chaos due to the range of digital formats being adopted. Briefly, most people were happy backing DAB, until DAB \u2013 globally \u2013 failed. So, in 2006, the World DAB Forum changed its name to WorldDMB and agreed a new global standard, DAB+, which would make everything all right again. Or not. The UK radio industry still wants DAB, it says, but Australia is going for DAB+. Germany is turning off DAB at the end of the year and may go to DAB+. Sweden&apos;s broadcasters asked for DAB+ but their government reckons it&apos;s cheaper and more efficient to use the TV network, DVB-T2. France has picked T-DMB, but may change its mind. And so on. For a running commentary on the various international twists and turns, read Grant Goddard&apos;s radio blog. There are also at least two more approved European standards. One is DRM (Digital Radio Mondiale), which is being upgraded to DRM+. The other is SDR (Satellite Digital Radio), which is similar to the systems used in the US and South Korea. Confused? You should be. Everybody recognises that global standards are required so that designers and their (usually Asian) manufacturer can increase production volumes, drive down prices, and deliver devices that consumers can use anywhere. Only compatible technologies can enable competition on content. Instead, nations are acting like minor fiefdoms, making long-term decisions based on arbitrary local conditions. This might be OK if there were no alternatives. However, most people in the UK can also get digital radio via DVB-T, in the form of a \u00a320 Freeview set-top box. On Freeview, 20 digital radio stations take up far less space than one HDTV channel. Other households get a digital radio option via their cable or satellite TV supplier. Most people in the UK can also get global standard digital radio streamed over the internet. At the moment, most listen using their PCs, but standalone Wi-Fi radios are getting cheaper and easier to &quot;tune&quot;. A Wi-Fi radio can be plugged in anywhere there&apos;s a Wi-Fi signal. It offers access to many thousands of stations from all over the world \u2013 including the BBC&apos;s national and local stations \u2013 and lets listeners create their own &quot;stations&quot; using services such as Spotify, last.fm and (if available) Pandora. Internet radio&apos;s sound quality can be much higher than DAB or even DAB+. Indeed, someone with an 8Mbps internet connection could listen to about 100 DAB-quality radio stations at once. The problem, of course, is getting the internet to a car driver, a commuter, or someone just walking down the street. However, that should be practicable using either WiMax (a souped-up long range Wi-Fi) or the next generation of mobile broadband, known as LTE (Long Term Evolution). While broadcasters watch rival digital platforms for signs that listeners are actually adopting them, sales of FM receivers grow faster than those of DAB sets. It has become increasingly difficult to buy a DAB radio that doesn&apos;t have FM as well. Also, FM radios are becoming common in MP3 players, mobile phones and other portable devices, just as Taunton said. The radio industry analyst Grant Goddard agrees: &quot;For me, the main benefit of radio has always been its portability, and perhaps we&apos;re entering a boom time for radio on portable devices.&quot; This is a global phenomenon. Key decisions are being taken in China, South Korea and Taiwan, in Finland and the US, not in London. A golden age of FM and internet radio is the last thing DAB&apos;s backers need with a 2015 target in mind."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/davehillblog/2009/nov/04/dilettante-music-concert-wiltons-music-hall-juliana-farha-kit-malthouse", "publicationDate": "2009-11-04T15:41:55Z", "tags": ["London", "Kit Malthouse"], "sentences": ["The three finalists - from Taiwan, the US and Canada - have already had their efforts recorded by the London Sinfonietta and tomorrow evening that ensemble will perform the pieces at the historic Wilton&apos;s Music Hall in Grace&apos;s Alley, close by Cable Street."], "title": "Boris Johnson aide Kit Malthouse has classical music connections", "article": "Juliana Farha is founder and MD of Dilettante Music, a &quot;global hub for classical music.&quot; Back in June, Dilettante launched a competition to find a young composer to take up digital residence on the site.

Likewise, we are engaged in a post Dead Aid discussion about the efficacy of western aid. As Rwandan president Paul Kagame&apos;s article on Cif demonstrated, the two are not discrete issues. However, the public discussions on both have been alarmingly one-dimensional and highlight and a surprisingly retrograde notion of both Africa&apos;s self-determination and what constitutes influence in 21st-century global politics. There have been valid criticisms of the way that China has invested in Africa, notably in terms of the import of labour in the early days. (Arms, too, but China is far from alone in supplying questionable regimes, to put it mildly). However, to think that China is a monolith is naive. China&apos;s models have been in flux since the new wave of investment began at the start of this century and Beijing is surprisingly sensitive to criticism. The rate at which China has evolved domestically is testament to its ability to learn. There is a more persistent theme to the debate, though, which I think says more about us than any other. Does China&apos;s investment undermine human rights? Does China, with its record on curtailing freedom, transfer its values to the African states that it invests in? Does it have a pernicious influence that will tear Africa away from western values? Is China building a &quot;Beijing consensus&quot; to displace Washington? I am not even convinced that the US, barring a few cold warriors, sees this element of danger. The last administration saw threats everywhere, but the Bush-era assistant secretary of state for Africa, Jendayi Frazer, rightly scolded me a few months ago for using the word &quot;influence&quot; when talking about the interplay of the international actors on the continent. International relationships in the 21st century are not exclusive, and neither is there the cold war expectation that countries align to a dominant power then act at their beck and call \u2013 if that was ever a true paradigm. The US has been the biggest single investor and the biggest trade partner to the continent for decades. Why did this not translate into &quot;influence&quot;? The US has asked for African nations&apos; support on the UN security council as recently as 2003. China&apos;s most persistent campaign for a say in Africa centred on its desire to get on to the security council in place of Taiwan. This was achieved in 1971, well before Beijing amassed its giant surplus of dollars. And yet the fear seems to be durable. Why? Because it stands in stark contrast to the relationship we think we think we are supposed to have with Africa. We cannot separate this debate on China from the parallel one on aid and aid effectiveness. If anything is about influence, it is aid, and nowhere is this demonstrated better than Brussels. I have just come back from European Development Days in Stockholm, the EU&apos;s annual aid community get-together. Here you can get to see what next year&apos;s fashion in development will be, and meet with the new donors on the scene. There were sizeable displays from the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia, for example, who have recently begun to operate national development agencies. Accession countries do not give aid entirely for altruistic reasons, nor do they do so simply because they have bought into the global self-interest. They do it with at least one eye on Brussels, and probably both. Aid gives a disproportionate amount of influence \u2013 not in Africa, but in Europe. Aid gets you a seat at the table within the UN. Aid is not designed to be efficient, it is designed to be influential. This is why our own development agency, the Department for International Development, has been so committed to European multilateralism. It is thus inevitable that there are hypocrisies. That is why subsidies \u2013 particularly in agriculture \u2013 destroy what aid builds and why donor cash is used for elaborate ceilings in Geneva. It is why vast amounts of money are spent on the proliferation of isolated projects that have little or no system-wide impact on poverty alleviation. I am not a believer in Dambisa Moyo&apos;s thesis that aid is dead, but I feel we need to inject more realism into what we expect of it. Distilling the debate to &quot;aid is bad, China is good&quot; or vice versa, and not examining the complexities and the nuances of the two interlocking themes will leave us in a weak position to adjust to the new global paradigm. We still like to see ourselves as the saviours, and African nations as places dangerously liable to fall under the sway of seductive foreign powers. This is patronising at best. As President Kagame has said, Africa is not a marginal player squeezed between two great giants. The cold war is over and the new world, while it might seem bipolar, is not. Africa \u2013 the whole developing world, in fact \u2013 is building relationships with a multitude of partners, some who subscribe to our values and some who do not. We are only ever going to be one of them, and unless we understand the full context and the interrelation of all of these factors, we are going to be a partner of waning relevance. If that happens, we have no right to begrudge anyone for stepping into the vacuum."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/nov/06/windows7-pc-sales-slow", "publicationDate": "2009-11-06T15:15:54Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Windows", "Windows 7", "Computing", "Technology"], "sentences": ["Any PC manufacturers who have been looking for Windows 7 to boost sales appear to be out of luck, according to a report from DigiTimes in Taiwan."], "title": "PC sales not seeing much of a Windows 7 effect", "article": "Any PC manufacturers who have been looking for Windows 7 to boost sales appear to be out of luck, according to a report from DigiTimes in Taiwan. The story (time-limited link) says:  Demand for PCs and hardware did not turn strong after the launch of Windows 7 in late October and is unlikely to do so in 2009 due to most Windows Vista users not needing to replace their PCs in order to upgrade to Windows 7, while some users are waiting for Microsoft to release Windows 7&apos;s first service pack, according to sources at PC vendors.  It&apos;s hard to see what sort of effect Windows 7 might be having. Were PC sales slow because people were waiting for Windows 7, or because of the economic recession? Will pre-Christmas sales increase due to Windows 7? They would increase anyway, regardless of Windows 7. Another factor is that most people take months to buy a new PC, and businesses can easily take 18-24 months. The appearance of Windows 7 ought to produce some sort of spike because of pent-up demand, but the long-term trend is more important. It looks as though Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer was right when he said the sales bump would &quot;probably not be huge&quot;. However, DigiTimes says:   Some notebook vendors are also facing surplus inventory as they placed a lot of Windows 7-based notebook orders in the third quarter hoping to satisfy demand during the peak season, but market demand has turned out to be weaker than some expected.  Microsoft itself may not be as strongly affected, because Vista users have been able to buy heavily-discounted in-place upgrade versions of Windows 7. And although there&apos;s an internet meme for kicking Vista, it has millions of users, according to NPD&apos;s 2009 Household Penetration Study of computer-owning US households. Stephen Baker, NPD&apos;s vice president, industry analysis, says: &quot;25% of [US] households have a desktop running Vista and 40% have a notebook with Vista, so there are a lot of folks to move&quot;. For comparison, the number for Apple computers is 12%. NPD has just issued a press release (already referenced here by Bobbie Johnson: Microsoft boosted as Windows 7 sales outpace Vista) that covers the US retail market, including suppliers such as Amazon. It says:  According to NPD&apos;s weekly tracking service, Windows 7 software unit sales in the US were 234% higher than Vista&apos;s first few days of sales. Revenue growth was not as strong though. A combination of early discounts on pre-sales and a lack of promotional activity for the Ultimate version resulted in dollar sales that were only 82% higher than for Vista.  Like DigiTimes, NPD notes that &quot;PC hardware sales had more of an uphill battle&quot;. NPD&apos;s press release says:  Total Windows PCs, however, were up 49% in shipments on-year and were up 95% over the week prior to launch. But, PC sales growth during the Vista launch was stronger, soaring 68% over the prior year&apos;s sales and 170% over the week preceding the launch. Windows PC sales were down 6% compared to PC sales during the Vista launch week.  As always, it&apos;s a question of expectations. If your Windows 7 PC production was based on US retail sales increasing by 50% over the prior week, you&apos;d be happy. If you were banking on something better than Vista&apos;s 170% spike, you&apos;d be miserable."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/nov/08/allison-fisher-pool-interview", "publicationDate": "2009-11-08T00:10:02Z", "tags": ["Snooker", "Sport"], "sentences": ["First, you win the women&apos;s nine-ball pool gold medal representing the United Kingdom at the World Games in Taiwan."], "title": "Allison Fisher beat the men at snooker, now she earns more than them playing pool", "article": "It is a connoisseur&apos;s hat-trick.

Many sports stars would struggle to complete the equivalent of the above in a lifetime; Allison Fisher has pulled it off in the last few months. Sitting in a cafe in Islington, with her mum beside her chugging on an inhalator after open heart surgery, Fisher could not be more modest about her achievements. Not the least of which is that she was world snooker champion 11 times before she even took up pool. It all began with Pot Black. She was sitting watching the programme with her father and was immediately entranced. Various small tables were bought and then the family moved to Peacehaven (&quot;A rash on the countryside \u2026 there is no worse in England&quot; \u2013 Pevsner). &quot;There was a snooker table in the local pub, the Peacehaven Central Club, and I begged my parents to let me play on it,&quot; she remembers. &quot;I was 12 years old and could only play four hours a week because I was still at school and doing hockey, netball and basketball.&quot; Within a year she was picked for the pub league team. &quot;They tried me out for the last game of the season and I did really well so they put me in the team.&quot; A few rival clubs refused to let her play but despite this &quot;by the time I left the league I had won every trophy going&quot;. Next step was the women&apos;s national tournaments. &quot;I read about it in the newspapers and thought: &apos;Bloody hell, I didn&apos;t know anything about that.&apos; In my first tournament I played a seeded player and lost 3-2 on the black and shook hands and started crying. &quot;The next tournament I reached the quarter-final. The one after the final. And the fourth one I won.&quot; Then Frank Callan entered her life. &quot;He came up to my Dad and said: &apos;I&apos;d like to teach your daughter and I won&apos;t charge you anything.&apos;&quot; Callan, a one-time wet fish merchant, is the man who made Steve Davis. He says of himself: &quot;I am of a peculiar nature. I can&apos;t change a plug at home. But I like sports. I like taking things to pieces and putting them together again, are you with me? I like to look into things. I don&apos;t stop at the surface.&apos; Davis says of Callan: &quot;It sounds big-headed, but we know so much more than anybody else about the game, that we talk on a level that very few people do. Usually you start talking to somebody that you think should know about snooker, and you can see you&apos;re losing them. That doesn&apos;t happen with Frank.&quot; &quot;I went for the weekend with Frank,&quot; Fisher says, &quot;and I learned about putting a pause in the stroke.&quot; Her next tournament was the world championships. She was 17. She won. And she kept on winning. Her exploits registering on Barry Hearn&apos;s radar \u2013 he signed her up in her early 20s as &quot;a warm-up act for the Matchroom League&quot;. And then invited her to play in the league, where she beat Neal Foulds, Tony Drago and Mike Hallett, and drew with Alan McManus, Stephen Hendry and Tony Meo. &quot;The ones I did beat didn&apos;t take it too well,&quot; she says. &quot;They were not happy, not happy at all. They have big egos and a lot of the guys couldn&apos;t cope with losing to a female.&quot; There were exceptions to the misogynistic mean. &quot;I paired up with Steve Davis and won three world doubles titles. John Parrott and Stephen Hendry played me like a player, not like a girl. Jimmy White was always wonderful.&quot; Meanwhile, she continued racking up world championships until a tournament in India proved to be a break too far. &quot;It was meant to be in February and it was postponed, postponed, postponed, postponed and it eventually ended up in August and I&apos;d really lost interest. And we got there and it was just a concrete room with the air conditioning hanging out of the door and a red curtain on the wall and I said to my mum: &apos;This is the last time you will see me play snooker.&apos;&quot; To fulfil the promise, the 27-year-old Fisher bought a one-way ticket to Las Vegas then secured an invitation to a tournament at Mother&apos;s Billiard Parlor in Charlotte, North Carolina. &quot;As soon as I walked in, I thought: &apos;This is it.&apos;&quot; After just a fortnight playing pool, Fisher finished ninth. The next tournament she won. &quot;Then I was addicted to it.&quot; Unlike women&apos;s snooker, which is the poor relation to the men&apos;s game women&apos;s pool has for the last few decades been more successful than the men&apos;s game. Once again, Fisher kept on winning. To date she has won 50 WPBA titles, including four world nine-ball tournaments. In 2000-01 she won eight consecutive tournaments. In 2005, she was the highest earner, of either sex, winning \u00a3111,000. &quot;Given that I have a weak break and the luck involved in the game, I have had a tremendous run over a couple of decades, old chap.&quot; But couldn&apos;t she have made even more as a hustler? &quot;Someone said to me: &apos;Don&apos;t get known on the tour. Let me know when you are coming over and we&apos;ll make some money.&apos;&quot; There was apparently a latter-day Bobby Riggs keen to play any woman for $100,000 at one-pocket pool. But Fisher declined. &quot;It was not my cup of tea,&quot; she says. Her strengths are her cueing action and mental fortitude. &quot;When you are playing pool you are thinking only three shots ahead. It&apos;s about getting from A to B to C and knocking out A and then getting\u00a0from B to C to D and then knocking out B \u2026&quot; Fisher still lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. &quot;It picked me. I played my first tournament here and have stayed ever since.&quot; In February her partner is due to give birth. &quot;I came out in Stella magazine and it opened up a lot of things. I&apos;m in a very secure loving and happy relationship and comfortable with my life and looking forward to motherhood.

Each finished bike has 16 stamps identifying the craftsmen who shaped it. &quot;Our patent ran out nine years ago, and if we were making this bike in Taiwan, staff turnover would mean that knowledge would be lost. Years of love have gone into our staff,&quot; says Butler-Adams. The bike is named after the Brompton Oratory in South Kensington, which the company&apos;s founder, Andrew Ritchie, could see from the window of his flat as he worked on the prototype in the early 80s. And while the company spins on one intrinsic design, Brompton means different things to different nationalities. In Barcelona young urbanites whizz down the Ramblas to the sea, while in Germany it remains the preserve of the 50-something Herr. Simon Threadkell, creative director at Fitch, a branding expert and Brompton owner, says riders of the bike make up a discrete club: &quot;It&apos;s like VW beetle drivers flashing their headlights at each other \u2013 there is a sense of belonging. It&apos;s a disparate organic community.&quot; In Britain the club&apos;s membership is changing, with 35-40% of Brompton customers now women. The average rider&apos;s age has also dropped below 40. Ben Cooper, who runs the Kinetics bike shop in Glasgow, reports a trend for &quot;his and hers&quot; purchasing. &quot;Couples often buy together,&quot; he says. &quot;At the moment I&apos;m doing a pink and purple one for &apos;her&apos;, while &apos;his&apos; is a more manly sand colour.&quot; Working at full pelt Brompton&apos;s cult appeal means the brand punches well above its weight in terms of awareness. Although sales have grown by at least 20% for the past four years, it is a small player with a turnover of \u00a310m in a UK bike market worth about \u00a3450m a year. The factory is working at full pelt but buyers must still wait 10 weeks for delivery. Butler-Adams concedes the company may have lost market share in the fast-growing folding market but says it is not chasing volume sales. Like some other premium brands it refuses to supply the market-leading retailer, Halfords, which sells \u00a3200m worth of bikes and accessories a year, preferring to deal with bike &quot;specialists&quot;. &quot;I&apos;d love to sell their product,&quot; says Halfords&apos; chief executive, David Wild. &quot;Folding bikes are a real area of opportunity and we are not doing as good a job as I&apos;d like on ranging at the moment.&quot; And competition is increasing. Halfords has developed its own folding bikes, using its house brand, Apollo, while the Los Angeles-based Dahon is the world&apos;s largest folding bike manufacturer. So why not sell out to private equity and double the size of the factory in a heartbeat \u2013 or move production to Taiwan? Butler-Adams looks appalled. The company, he says, is not constrained by a lack of funds \u2013 it is debt free \u2013 but by the time is takes to train master bike builders. &quot;Bring five new people in and it takes five to train them. There is a limit to what you can do and if you fill a factory with new people you dilute the knowledge in the business.&quot; Brompton has already invested close to \u00a31m in Kew Bridge and plans to spend another \u00a3500,000 at the site, with less specialist jobs outsourced to factories in Europe and Asia. When Butler-Adams joined in 2002, Brompton made 7,000 bikes a year; this year it will be 25,000, with a target of 50,000 on the near horizon. &quot;In two years we will be kicking arse,&quot; he says."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/11/apple-worldwide-iphone-plan", "publicationDate": "2009-11-11T20:22:08Z", "tags": ["Telecommunications industry", "Business", "iPhone", "Apple", "Technology", "Nokia"], "sentences": ["Kumar&apos;s prediction follows a recent report by industry analysts OTR Global which quoted sources in the Taiwan handset supply chain as saying they had been contracted to supply a &quot;hybrid&quot; iPhone by the third quarter of 2010."], "title": "Apple 'plans iPhone that will work anywhere in world'", "article": "Apple is planning to launch a new version of the iPhone which will work almost anywhere in the world, according to American technology experts. The &quot;worldwide&quot; version of the iPhone will be sold first in the US market next summer by Verizon Wireless, in which Vodafone has a 45% stake, according to Ashok Kumar, analyst at Northeast Securities. The new phone will use a microchip developed by Qualcomm that can use both the 3G networks which predominate in Europe and Africa as well as the CDMA2000 network used by Verizon in the US and other networks across the world. &quot;This Qualcomm-powered world phone will facilitate Apple to be carrier-agnostic,&quot; Kumar said, meaning it would be able to further expand its list of mobile network partners. Kumar&apos;s prediction follows a recent report by industry analysts OTR Global which quoted sources in the Taiwan handset supply chain as saying they had been contracted to supply a &quot;hybrid&quot; iPhone by the third quarter of 2010. When Apple initially launched the iPhone in 2007 it did so under exclusive deals with network partners in the US, UK, France and Germany. Since then, however, it has abandoned this strategy in order to sell iPhones through many more mobile phone networks across the world. Earlier this week, Orange started selling the iPhone in the UK, ending O2&apos;s two-year long exclusive deal. Orange reckons that it had sold over 30,000 by 4pm on the first day of sales, while Carphone Warehouse believes it will sell a 1m iPhones by Christmas. The success of the iPhone has made Apple the world&apos;s most profitable smartphone manufacturer, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, overtaking the world&apos;s largest handset producer, Nokia. The research firm has examined the smartphone market for the three months to the end of September \u2013 in which 43m phones that can access the web, send emails and download applications were sold \u2013 and reckons that Apple surpassed Nokia for the first time ever. &quot;We estimate Apple&apos;s operating profit for its iPhone handset division stood at $1.6bn in the third quarter of 2009,&quot; said Alex Spektor, analyst at Strategy Analytics. &quot;Apple overtook Nokia for the first time, which recorded a lower $1.1bn of operating profit. With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost controls, the PC vendor has successfully broken into the mobile phone market in just two years.&quot; Nokia has struggled to produce a lucrative rival to the iPhone. The Apple device has also spawned a host of touchscreen devices from other handset manufacturers including HTC, Samsung and Motorola, all of which have eaten into Nokia&apos;s share of a smartphone market it once dominated. Last month, Nokia announced its first quarterly loss for more than a decade. The slew of touchscreen phones that have hit the shops have helped the smartphone market outperform the rest of the mobile phone industry, where sales have been in decline. But Nokia does not seem able to capitalise on the fact that consumers want high-end devices and its share of the smartphone market is slipping. Last month, Nokia said it reckoned the entire mobile phone industry shipped 288m units in the quarter, down 7% on the same period a year ago, but up 7% on the second quarter. Nokia, however, shipped 108.5m units in the third quarter, which is down 8% on the same period last year and only up 5% on the previous quarter. Nokia stripped out smartphone sales from the overall figures, estimating that 47m &quot;converged mobile devices&quot; were shipped in the three months, compared with an estimated 44.2m units in the third quarter of 2008 and 41m units in the second quarter of 2009. Of that total figure, Nokia sold 16.4m units in the third quarter of 2009; that is down from 16.9m in the second quarter of 2009 but admittedly a better performance than the 15.5m it shipped in the third quarter of the previous year. Just a week after the results were announced, Nokia took the dramatic step of launching a legal attack on Apple in the US courts, alleging the iPhone infringes 10 of its patents in a dispute that could drag on for years."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/12/short-sightedness-myopia", "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T00:05:05Z", "tags": ["Health & wellbeing", "Health", "Society", "Children", "Medical research", "Epidemics"], "sentences": ["According to New Scientist, 80% of young adults now need glasses in Asian countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2013 so many that you wonder whether the teasing tables have been turned (do the kids with 20-20 vision get called &quot;two-eyed&quot;?)."], "title": "Why is there an epidemic of short-sightedness?", "article": "The day the optician told me I needed glasses, I burst into tears. I was 10 years old \u2013 gawky, bookish, rubbish at sport \u2013 and the chalk-marks on the school blackboard were looking increasingly blurry. Now, the optician said, I&apos;d be able to see again \u2013 but only by attaching to my head what looked like an instrument of torture designed to extract the maximum potential for teasing. With their thick curved lenses and speckled green frames, my first glasses looked like something Timmy Mallett would wear. And that was definitely not a good thing. Now, it seems, increasing numbers of children and teenagers are sharing my pain. Over the last couple of decades, there&apos;s been a massive surge in short-sightedness in young people around the world (the condition is usually diagnosed in teenagers). According to New Scientist, 80% of young adults now need glasses in Asian countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan \u2013 so many that you wonder whether the teasing tables have been turned (do the kids with 20-20 vision get called &quot;two-eyed&quot;?). Rates are lower over here \u2013 between 30 and 50% \u2013 but ophthalmologists agree that myopia is on the rise. &quot;We can&apos;t be sure of the numbers,&quot; says Winfried Amoaku, consultant ophthalmologist at Queen&apos;s Medical Centre in Nottingham, &quot;but the increase in myopia, especially in eastern countries, really is quite rampant.&quot; So what lies behind this myopia epidemic? The traditional explanation has been reading, which some scientists think can cause the lenses in children&apos;s eyes to elongate, blurring the image recorded by the retina. Myopia does still seem to afflict bookish types more (just glance round your local library), but no one has found a definitive link. &quot;Being short-sighted does not,&quot; Amoaku explains curtly, &quot;mark you out as an intellectual.&quot; Kids have been reading for centuries, anyway \u2013 and most prefer TVs and computers these days. So are screens to blame? Most ophthalmologists agree that excessive screen-watching can accelerate myopia \u2013 though Amoaku says it&apos;s fine as long as you stay at &quot;piano-distance&quot; from the screen (defined, quaintly, as the distance you&apos;d sit from an upright piano). The fall-off in school sport could also be a factor. Playing sport does seem to have a positive effect on children&apos;s eye health: one recent American study of eight-year-olds found that around one in five became myopic within four years \u2013 and almost all of those that did played little or no sport. But even more remarkably, our increasing tendency to keep kids indoors could actually be to blame. In a recent study of more than 2,000 12-year-old Australians, playing sport indoors turned out to be of no benefit for the eyes \u2013 but sitting around in the fresh air was. Diet could also play a part. In 2002, the American evolutionary biologist Loren Cordain linked myopia with a high-carb diet, though that doesn&apos;t explain why the Asian diet \u2013 traditionally carbohydrate-rich \u2013 should only now be affecting sight. For Amoaku, then, the answer is to &quot;do all the normal, healthy things, with a good diet and exercise&quot;. And even if that doesn&apos;t work, most short-sighted kids will eventually find \u2013 as I did \u2013 that wearing glasses is really nothing to cry about."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/nov/12/older-technophobes-simplicity-computer", "publicationDate": "2009-11-12T14:30:00Z", "tags": ["Technology", "Technology sector", "Business", "Older people", "Society"], "sentences": ["But, fair&apos;s fair, this is a very professionally produced package that has an open source (made by the community) Linux operating system inside and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 is manufactured not in China or Taiwan but in Somerset."], "title": "Can SimplicITy prove itself to technophobes? | Victor Keegan", "article": "The trouble with writing about technology for, er, older people is that you have lost half your audience by the end of the first sentence because they think they are too young to bother. And by the end of the second many of the rest go away because they feel they are being patronised. Yet the underlying problem of making computers and mobile phones user-friendly affects everyone and is one that manufacturers have been woefully slow to address. Time and again I have tried computers and phones which are supposed to be user-friendly but which fall at the first fence. If there is an extra-large keypad on a mobile the odds are the keys will be difficult to press and the whole phone too heavy, and if it is a computer the intuitive difficulty of getting a technophobe, older person or not, past the introductory stage is rarely addressed in a successful manner. I had high hopes for the social networking site for families, finerday.com but it ran into teething problems. (It has now claimed that it is growing &quot;very fast&quot; in numbers with new features being added.) So it was with low expectations that I trotted over yesterday morning to, of all places, the Institute of Directors in London where a computer called SimplicITy was being promoted by former Blue Peter star Valerie Singleton. With a price tag of \u00a3435, this is not going to solve the digital divide. But then it is not intended to. It is aimed mainly at richer people over 50 who have more savings and spending power than average, and the people behind it claim it is very competitive once you price in the step-by-step video tutorials that come free with it. That&apos;s a fair point. The tutorials \u2013 beautifully spoken by Singleton herself \u2013 are very clear and take you through all the basic steps from using a mouse to setting up an email account. True, these days it probably wouldn&apos;t have been long before something appeared on YouTube anyway, which has tutorials for practically anything you can think of. But, fair&apos;s fair, this is a very professionally produced package that has an open source (made by the community) Linux operating system inside and \u2013 wait for it \u2013 is manufactured not in China or Taiwan but in Somerset. This computer won&apos;t solve the key problems of setting up broadband or of persuading technophobic people of whatever age to actually sit in front of a computer in the first place. Once you can persuade them to do that most of the battle has already been won. It only takes about 45 seconds with a typical computer to teach newcomers how to use a search engine. After all, it is only a question of typing in the query and pressing carriage return. Email could take another five minutes. If they can&apos;t read what is on the screen it is a simple matter to increase the size of the letters by pressing the control key (or command key on a Mac) together with the + sign. But for those without a willing tutor who are keen to try, SimplicITy is better than anything comparable I have yet come across. It deserves to succeed in its modest target of 200,000 unit sales over five years. If it can prove there is a market there then others might come in and prices could fall. They are already thinking of doing the same thing with mobile phones. This is a largely untapped market with huge potential which would bring in its wake economic benefits as more people would have access to the treasure chest of knowledge about practically anything that lies on the other side of a search engine. And it wouldn&apos;t do Somerset any harm either."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/nov/13/google-gizmo5-verizon-go", "publicationDate": "2009-11-13T06:30:00Z", "tags": ["Mobile phones", "Google", "Intel", "Technology", "Verizon Communications"], "sentences": ["* DigiTimes in Taiwan has published news and a nice table of some forthcoming Intel chips, including three 32nm dual-core Arrandale (Calpella platform) processors for ultra-thin notebooks in the first half of next year."], "title": "Breakfast briefing: Google is becoming a phone company, and other stories", "article": "The great thing about Google is that it scares the heck out of practically everybody in a wide range of IT and media businesses, and it looks as though the phone companies could be next to feel the heat.

Now the Big G&apos;s blog has officially bought Gizmo5, and its team will join the GrandCentral acquisition now known as Google Voice. Gizmo5 is a small &quot;softphone&quot; company that enables its 6m registered users to make voice calls over the net (VoIP), and according to reports, it was in the process of being bought by Skype. Gizmo5 calls go via a server rather than using a peer-to-peer network like Skype, but Google knows all about running servers than can handle hundreds of millions of users.  &quot;Google is set to become your new phone company, perhaps reducing your phone bill to zilch in the process.

It says:  As the US market leader in wireless data service, we typically don&apos;t respond to competitors&apos; advertising.

Some took this as Google arrogantly trampling the small-fry underfoot because, after all, Google is evil. But it seems more likely that Google just didn&apos;t notice.

Mao&apos;s proposal, made a year before the Chinese civil war in which the US backed Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s rule, never reached Roosevelt. What might have happened if they had met is a fascinating counter-factual question of history. After the communist victory in 1949, two decades of hostility ended with Nixon&apos;s visit to Beijing in 1972 when China became a useful ally for Washington against the Soviet Union. Since then the relationship has fluctuated but has always been seen on the Chinese side as essential \u2013 less consistently so by the US. What is different today, and what takes the Obama administration into new territory, is that it is at last a relationship of equals: the US now needs China as much as China needs the US. The contrast with the last presidential state visit to China, by Bill Clinton in 1998, is striking. That event was more show than substance, carefully choreographed to give the president a much-needed boost after the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clinton urged the virtues of democracy upon President Jiang Zemin and offered to act as a go-between for him and the Dalai Lama. It looked good at the time but the Tibetan offer came predictably to nothing and six months later Jiang launched a crackdown on the Chinese democracy movement. Within another six months, the US air force bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, provoking a wave of genuine anger across China. George Bush, in his presidential campaign, would label China as a potential strategic threat, not as a partner. It was the shock of 9/11 that gave China a grim golden chance to make itself more useful to the US (and target its own Muslim dissidents in Xinjiang province) by signing up to the war on terror. Yet in spite of Chinese entry into the World Trade Organisation, Beijing knew that the relationship remained less than equal: in the wry expression of a senior Chinese diplomat &quot;we think it is better to remain number two&quot;. Today&apos;s relationship occupies a completely different world in which there is talk of a Sino-US G2, and even suggestions that China might become No 1. The past rhetoric of both sides \u2013 &quot;empty cannons&quot; as Chairman Mao once called them \u2013 seems dated. China is not going to make too much fuss about continued US arms sales to Taiwan (when was that island last in the headlines?). Human rights in China \u2013 never a huge concern to Washington (only a month after the Beijing massacre in 1989, a secret US envoy was sent to Beijing to maintain relations) \u2013 will be mentioned for form&apos;s sake by Obama. But the priorities identified by Obama earlier this week are the only ones that really matter: &quot;climate change, economic recovery, nuclear non-proliferation&quot;. The US says it seeks a &quot;comprehensive partnership&quot; with China in what Jon Huntsman, new US ambassador to Beijing, calls &quot;the most important bilateral relationship in the world&quot;. This is music to the ears of Chinese foreign policy advisers in Beijing who have often worried about the underlying &quot;inequality&quot; in US-China relations. The presidents whom they advised, Jiang and now Hu Jintao, can privately tell internal critics that their long-term strategic policy of putting the relationship with the US first has paid off. More openly, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has warned the US military establishment that China should be regarded as a partner, not an adversary. Does China perhaps have the upper hand in this relationship, as it measures another 8% growth in GDP against the limping US economy? Hardly so, if we consider the real implication of the familiar statistic that China now holds $800bn in US Treasury bonds. Obama may ask Beijing to revalue the Renminbi; Hu may ask Washington to &quot;focus on its own financial deficit&quot;, but the Chinese surplus rides on the American debt as if on the back of the Old Man of the Sea: neither can let go of the other. And China&apos;s extensive growth over almost two decades is not only unhealthily dependent on foreign markets, but has been bought at the expense of a deteriorating environment and a worsening rich-poor divide. US presidential visits to China have always had a showbiz element \u2013 ever since Richard Nixon stood on the Great Wall and declared that it was truly a great wall. We may expect a wave of Obama-fever in the Chinese media: every tabloid paper \u2013 and there are a lot of them now \u2013 will want to have Michelle on the front page. Yet the widely read Huanqiu Bao (Global Times) says that the Obama visit &quot;won&apos;t shake the world&quot; and that most Chinese people have &quot;neither strong concerns nor high expectations&quot;.

Vodafone is understood to be mulling involvement in a consortium run by JP Morgan&apos;s private equity arm which has tabled an offer for a controlling stake in the Bahamas Telecommunications Company (BTC). Vodafone would provide the technical know-how for the venture, rather than cash, but in return receive a stake in the business. The government is initially looking to sell 51% of the business. But O&apos;Brien&apos;s emerging markets wireless business Digicel, which has operations in 26 countries in the Caribbean and Central America, is also one of the four potential bidders for BTC, The other two are investment groups backed by mobile phone operators. Cable &amp; Wireless is believed to have ruled itself out. Neither Digicel nor Vodafone would comment. O&apos;Brien, who last week saw his attempt to interrupt a massive debt for equity swap at Independent News &amp; Media defeated, has operations to the south of the Bahamas, from the Turks and Caicos islands down to French Guiana. Vodafone customers are able to roam on Digicel&apos;s Carribbean networks under a three-year partner agreement signed in 2007. Teaming up with JP Morgan, however, would give the company a risk-free way of entering the local market as it would not need to put up any of its cash. Vodafone has so-called partner networks across the world from Armenia and Estonia to Afghanistan and Hong Kong. Its local partner gets access to a range of Vodafone products and devices, with the benefit of the firm&apos;s massive logistics base, while Vodafone gets to offer its customers \u2013 especially corporate users \u2013 who visit the country, access to all the services they would expect at home. Just last week Vodafone added Taiwan through a deal with local player Chunghwa Telecom. BTC, meanwhile, has been hit by the recession with the drop-off in tourism creating a corresponding reduction in lucrative mobile roaming revenues. At the same time it has seen costs rise as a result of a wage deal with unions and increased investment in its network. Last year, BTC made a net profit of $21.1m (\u00a313m), compared with $42.8m in 2007, according to the company&apos;s annual report and accounts. Of that drop, $18.7m related to increased costs and $3.5m to a drop in roaming revenues. Tourism has continued to be sluggish this year, although the hotel trade showed a slight pick-up in September. The government, however, took a $25m dividend on top of $16.4m in customs duties and $4m in regulatory fees The government of the Bahamas has been trying to privatise BTC for more than a decade. In 2002, the government created a new holding company for the business and several strategic investors conducted due diligence the following year. The price being offered, however, was below what the government had hoped and the process was shelved. Three years later, the government announced that it had started talks with a partner interested in taking a 49% stake but again those negotiations came to nothing. In March last year, the prime minister appointed a nine member privatisation committee which was given the task of completing the privatisation as quickly as possible, with a 51% stake up for grabs. The government had hoped to get privatisation completed in the first half of this year but the global financial crisis put paid to that idea and the process looks likely to drag on into next year. Once BTC has been privatised the government intends to open up the market after two years, with the sale of new wireless licences."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/16/barack-obama-shanghai-students-china", "publicationDate": "2009-11-16T08:06:05Z", "tags": ["China", "Barack Obama", "US news", "World news", "Asia Pacific"], "sentences": ["The president tackled issues ranging from internet censorship and the US stance on arms sale to Taiwan to his Nobel Peace Prize, in his question-and-answer session with around 300 students \u2013 his sole meeting with the Chinese public during his three-day visit to the country."], "title": "Barack Obama meets Shanghai students in China", "article": "The US believes that freedom of expression and political participation are universal values, Barack Obama told an audience of young Shanghai students today, in a townhall-style meeting streamed live on the White House website, broadcast on a local Shanghai television station and carried as text on a major Chinese portal.

In brief opening remarks Obama repeated earlier assurances that America welcomed China&apos;s rise adding: &quot;Because of our co-operation, the US and China are more prosperous and more secure.&quot; But he went on to highlight differences between the two countries, telling his audience: &quot;We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation. &quot;But we also don&apos;t believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation.&quot; &quot;These freedoms of expression, and worship, of access to information and political participation \u2013 we believe they are universal rights.

Campaigners have pushed hard for the president to speak out publicly on human rights issues. Aides have already indicated that he will raise them in his meetings with Chinese leaders. But Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Obama had missed an opportunity, framing such issues as a question of political culture rather than international legal norms. &quot;What&apos;s important is to put a degree of pressure on the Chinese government for its repressive practices,&quot; he said. &quot;You cannot do that without a degree of straight talk. That&apos;s not what happened at this meeting \u2026 What was needed was to include things relevant to what is happening in the country \u2013 as he did in Cairo, for example.&quot; For the most part, the president focused on a message of collaboration and mutual respect. Many of the most sensitive issues mentioned in the thousands of questions posted ahead of the event \u2013 such as Tibet \u2013 did not emerge. &quot;There are very few global challenges that can be solved unless the US and China agree,&quot; he told a questioner, citing the need to make progress on climate change. &quot;Other countries around the world will be waiting for us \u2026 If they say &apos;The US and China are not serious about this&apos;, they will not be serious either. That&apos;s the burden of leadership that both countries now carry.&quot; Obama&apos;s acknowledgement yesterday that time had run out to secure a legally binding deal at Copenhagen and backed plans to postpone a formal agreement until next year at earliest. But aides hope that the world&apos;s two largest emitters can move closer on the way forward. Obama is now on his way to Beijing for two days of talks with Hu and premier Wen Jiabao, which will also address North Korea and Iran&apos;s nuclear programmes and the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan. He will also visit the Forbidden City and Great Wall. Mo Shaoping, one of China&apos;s best-known human rights lawyers, told the Financial Times that people &quot;from the American side&quot; had contacted him to see whether he would meet Obama and that he was subsequently questioned about the event by public security officers. The US embassy said it had no knowledge of such a meeting.

Aides have said that Obama, who arrived tonight in the capital, Beijing, last night, will raise them in his meetings with Chinese leaders. He will hold a joint press conference with President Hu Jintao and visit the Forbidden City on a brief sightseeing break in the bilateral discussions. The two men met for dinner tonight. Sinologists in the US have long encouraged Washington to reach out to the Chinese public, as well as its leaders. But yesterday&apos;s meeting underlined the difficulties of doing so. The event had been billed as a town hall-style meeting, but Chinese officials rejected US proposals that 1,000 people should attend and that it should be broadcast live nationwide. Instead, it was streamed on the White House site, broadcast live on a local Shanghai television channel and transmitted in text form on state news agency Xinhua&apos;s website. Most Chinese citizens will have seen only brief extracts \u2013 not including the remarks on censorship. Although Obama selected questioners from the audience, those in the hall were picked by officials at Shanghai institutions. At least two of those who spoke were thought to be student officers of the Communist Youth League. Other questions were posted by internet users. One issues raised concerned arms sales to Taiwan \u2013 in a question Obama did not directly answer \u2013 another about the president&apos;s Nobel Peace Prize. It was the US ambassador Jon Huntsman who read out the question about China&apos;s &quot;Great Firewall&quot; and the blocking of Twitter, posted on a US government site. &quot;I think that the more freely information flows, the stronger the society becomes, because then citizens of countries around the world can hold their own governments accountable,&quot; Obama said. &quot;They can begin to think for themselves.&quot; He described himself as &quot;a big supporter of non-censorship&quot; and said criticism made him a better president. The comments on web censorship were carried on Xinhua, though bloggers reported that they disappeared from another news site. One Twitter user wrote: &quot;I will not forget this morning; I heard, on my shaky internet connection, a question about our own freedom which only a foreign leader can discuss.&quot; But influential Chinese blogger Michael Anti wrote: &quot;Except for the internet freedom Q&amp;A, Obama was too soft, carefully avoiding confronting China, so it made his town hall fail.&quot; In brief opening remarks Obama repeated earlier assurances that America welcomed China&apos;s rise, saying co-operation had made both countries more prosperous and secure. He also said that the US did not seek to impose any system of government on other nations. But he continued: &quot;These freedoms of expression, and worship, of access to information and political participation - we believe they are universal rights. They should be available to all people, including ethnic and religious minorities, whether they are in the United States, China or any nation.&quot; His predecessors Bill Clinton and George Bush were more explicit in highlighting concerns \u2013 while praising Chinese advances \u2013 when they spoke to students.

In a joint communique, the leaders said an accord in Denmark should include emission reduction targets for rich nations and a declaration of action plans to ease greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries. Countering concerns that a non-legal deal could evade many key issues, the communique said the climate talks should also increase financial assistance to developing countries, promote technology development, help poor communities to adapt and enhance forest protection.

This may not be good news for Barack Obama. Despite all the assurances that the US and China have to work together, Obama&apos;s trip reveals a relationship with a strangely lopsided quality to it. America is still the richer and more powerful nation. Its military is far ahead of the People&apos;s Liberation Army. The administration&apos;s international fence-restoration means that it can count on an array of allies, whereas China&apos;s are few and far between, and founded mainly on money. For all Beijing&apos;s efforts to spread its soft power, it cannot hold a candle to America when it comes to popular culture; how many Chinese film stars can most people outside Asia name \u2013 other than perhaps Jet Li or Jackie Chan? Say what you will about delays in closing Guant\u00e1namo, but most people would prefer American values to those of a regime that maintains a big repressive apparatus, locks up lawyers who defend ordinary citizens, puts petitioners in &quot;black jails&quot;, imposes crackdowns in Tibet and Xinjiang worthy of British imperialism at its depths and forbids its citizens to watch its national day parade in the streets. Not to mention the control freakery of the system and the restrictions on information. Though optimists still saw Obama&apos;s town hall meeting in Shanghai as progress it was a sign of how constrained America allows its freedom of action to be when its leader is on Chinese soil. But this week in Beijing, Obama has been on the back foot. Take the main issues of his visit: \u2022 Money. Like Bush during the war in Iraq, he needs Chinese cash to fund his stimulus package. Of course, there is another side to this equation. China would like to put more of its money elsewhere than in dollars but it cannot do so on any significant scale; it is fair bet that the decision-makers in Beijing do not fancy going into Italian bonds in a big way and there is a limit to the number of mining companies they can buy in Africa or Australia. \u2022 North Korea. The US depends on China to pull something out of the hat on the nuclear issue. \u2022 Climate change. As a lawyer who knows when his brief is full of holes, Obama executed a strategic retreat over the Copenhagen conference on his way to Shanghai, which leaves the People&apos;s Republic free to do its own thing in dealing with its huge environmental crisis. \u2022 The currency. Washington would like Beijing to increase the value of the yuan, but the Chinese fired a pre-emptive strike at the weekend by castigating the combination of a weak dollar and monetary easing in the US, blaming it for the development of the destabilising &quot;carry trade&quot;, and they were right. \u2022 Trade. As the dollar declines, China is the big winner with its currency pegged to the greenback, its ability to lower input costs and its excess capacity. \u2022 Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan. He had to say something on the first, if only for domestic US reasons. But he kept it to a minimum and used wording designed not to ruffle Chinese feathers. China bulls speak of growth hitting 11.9% growth next year (such a precise figure immediately causes my eyebrows to twitch) and others see China&apos;s march to world supremacy as inevitable (it is noticeable that the triumphalism comes more from western observers than from serious Chinese analysts). I would be more cautious on both counts. China faces the biggest array of challenges of any administration on earth. These range from the aforementioned environmental issues to the wealth divide, corruption and the role of the Communist party, the retreat from legal reform, the demographic trap caused by the one-child policy and the increasing life expectancy of the aged. There is no doubting the short-term success of the administration in Beijing in climbing out of the hole caused from the spluttering of the export-driven economic model framed in the 1980s, but deeper structural reform which China needs appears to have been sidelined into sporadic local experiments. Hu Jintao and his colleagues have every reason to feel pleased with themselves. They have steered the economy back to 8% growth on the back of a huge fiscal and monetary stimulus. They have $2.4tn in foreign exchange reserves. The social instability which so many observers said would result from unemployment in export factories has not happened. China is managing its emergence from the crisis extremely well, with massive allocation of resources to projects and a drip-down effect on the rural sector. In short, the Chinese machine is working, whatever the doubts about its sustainability. That, after all, is what totalitarian systems are for \u2013 they can mobilise on a huge scale while democracies are delayed by due political process. What this means is that, for all his country&apos;s backwardness in many respects, Hu can look Obama in the eye, feeling like a winner who does not need to take any lessons. It is almost a year since I compared the two men to an odd couple who need one another. Can the lawyer from Chicago come up with a response to the party-led bureaucracy in Beijing, or will he have to plea bargain?"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/nov/19/apple-tablet-delayed-oled-taiwan", "publicationDate": "2009-11-19T12:36:28Z", "tags": ["Apple", "Technology", "Tablet computers"], "sentences": ["With those caveats in mind, DigiTimes in Taiwan is reporting that:   Apple reportedly plans to postpone the launch of its tablet PC from an original March launch schedule to the second half of 2010, as the vendor has decided to switch some components and plans to launch a model using a 9.7-inch OLED panel from LG Display, according to sources from component makers.", "It&apos;s assumed that each version will be made by a different Taiwanese supplier, with Foxconn Electronics (Hon Hai Precision Industry), Quanta Computer and Pegatron Technology being tipped by DigiTimes&apos;s source.", "It&apos;s not unknown for large PC manufacturers to have half a dozen contract manufacturers in Taiwan, with the main ones being Compal, Foxconn, Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta and Wistron."], "title": "Apple iTablet reportedly delayed until the second half of next year", "article": "Bear in mind that Apple&apos;s touch-screen tablet-style computer has not been announced, and stories about it may be mostly speculation.

It was typical of Yang not to make too much of his ordeal. He belonged to a generation of Chinese intellectuals who had chosen to support Mao Zedong&apos;s New China only to suffer for it in the extremism of the chairman&apos;s last years. Rather than rage against fate, those who survived would take refuge in humour and self-deprecation. Yang did so with a characteristic charm that concealed personal tragedy: his son became mentally disturbed after being sent to a factory during the Cultural Revolution and later committed suicide. Yang came from a typical scholar-gentry family of the late Manchu dynasty: his father was head of the Bank of China in the city of Tianjin, 80 miles south-east of Beijing, where he was born. He was educated at home by a tutor in the Chinese classics before attending a missionary school in one of Tianjin&apos;s foreign concessions. Yang devoured English literature from Joseph Addison to Oscar Wilde: while still at school he turned John Milton into classical Chinese verse. Also enjoying Athenian drama in translation, Yang resolved to go abroad to study ancient Greek and was taken to London by an English teacher at his school. Admitted to Merton College, Oxford, he studied classics for two years and then shifted to English literature with the poet Edmund Blunden, whose tutorials with him usually finished in the pub. More significantly, he met Gladys Tayler, the daughter of missionaries in China, at the Oxford China Society. With Gladys&apos;s help, he translated the lyrical poem Li Sao by Qu Yuan (4th century BC) into English heroic couplets in the style of John Dryden. The couple returned to China in 1940 and married in the wartime capital of Chongqing, working as teachers and translators in the Chinese Nationalist area. After the defeat of Japan they moved to Nanjing. Horrified by the violence of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, Yang joined the underground, passing on information gleaned from foreign diplomats. Ironically it was because of this pro-communist activity that, 20 years later in the Cultural Revolution, he would be labelled an anti-communist &quot;foreign spy&quot; . Though Yang and Gladys were offered seats on a plane to Taiwan when Chiang&apos;s government fled in 1949, it never occurred to them to leave. By 1952 they had joined the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing, in charge of an ambitious project to translate all the most important works of Chinese literature into English. The Yangs&apos; approach was faithful to the originals but always expressed in readable language. Their output over the years amounted to more than 60 titles: tens of thousands of foreign students of Chinese, from then till today, have relied on their work. The best-known titles include The Courtesan&apos;s Jewel Box (vernacular tales from the 10th to 17th centuries), the Qing dynasty novel The Scholars, and Selected Stories by the modern writer Lu Xun. Yang also translated many foreign classics into Chinese \u2013 including Homer&apos;s Odyssey and Bernard Shaw&apos;s Pygmalion \u2013 but the Chinese authorities regarded this dismissively as his &quot;private enterprise&quot;. After being released from detention, in 1972 the Yangs were allowed to complete their translation of the most famous novel of all, the 18th-century Dream of the Red Chamber, but still lived under a political cloud. I first met Gladys and Yang in April 1976, during the last turbulent months of Mao&apos;s life, in their dark apartment which could be reached only by clambering around piles of coal and cabbages. Loudly, Yang denounced &quot;that woman&quot; \u2014 Madam Mao, who was then staging a final bid for power. Gladys gestured towards the probably bugged telephone, crying out: &quot;Do shut up, old man, or we&apos;ll go back to jail!&quot; But after Mao&apos;s death it was his wife and her associates in the Gang of Four who were jailed, while the authorities apologised to the Yangs for their &quot;unwarranted arrest&quot; 10 years earlier. Yang now became chief editor of the monthly Chinese Literature magazine and launched a new series of translations under the Panda imprint \u2013 modelled on Penguin paperbacks. During the 1980s, their apartment became an informal salon where a new generation of Chinese writers and western journalists could meet, usually over a bottle of scotch. Encouraged by the new mood of political reform, Yang even joined the Communist party. In 1987 the party old guard hit back, sacking the reform-minded leader Hu Yaobang, and paving the way for the bloody events around Tiananmen Square two years later. When the crisis came, Yang decided he could no longer shrug politics aside. &quot;I could at least speak through the foreign TV and newspaper correspondents to the people outside China and tell them the true situation,&quot; he recalled in his autobiography White Tiger (2000). His message was that what had happened was &quot;a fascist coup engineered by a few diehards against political reform&quot;. In a BBC interview after the massacre during the night of 3-4 June, Yang declared that the party leaders were even worse than past Chinese warlords or Japanese invaders. The authorities, probably deterred by Yang&apos;s age and reputation abroad, left him at liberty, and after a vain attempt to persuade him to recant they merely expelled him from the party. In 1994, Yang and Gladys moved into the Beijing Friendship hotel, where they remained in quiet retirement till Gladys&apos;s death in 1999: Yang then lived peacefully with his daughter Yang Zhi and her husband David, in their courtyard house north of the Forbidden City. In 1993 Yang had been awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Hong Kong, where he was praised as a &quot;master translator&quot;. His worldwide reputation was never quite matched at home, but in September this year he received a lifetime award from the Translators&apos; Association of China. When he retired, Yang penned a short punning couplet to sum up his life: &quot;The bright youngster may not become a genius: muddle-headed in middle age, he is shameless \u2013 or toothless \u2013 when old&quot; (the two adjectives in Chinese have the same sound). &quot;Chinese intellectuals over the past century,&quot; Yang added in a wry footnote, &quot;have been mostly like this ... it is just the way things are&quot;. Though there was historical truth in Yang&apos;s judgment, it was too hard on him personally. Committed to revolutionary China for all its faults, he and Gladys made a huge intellectual contribution and, when it really counted, he did speak out. He is survived by two daughters and four grandchildren. \u2022 Yang Xianyi (or Hsien-yi), translator, born 10 January 1915; died November 23 2009"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/02/wikipedia-known-unknowns-geotagging-knowledge", "publicationDate": "2009-12-02T18:45:00Z", "tags": ["Wikipedia", "Technology", "Internet"], "sentences": ["If this weren&apos;t the case, the articles on Israel, Kashmir and Taiwan would not host such hotly contested edit wars."], "title": "Wikipedia's known unknowns", "article": "Are Wikipedia contributors running out of topics to write about?

The United States has the most articles about places or events (almost 100,000), while some smaller countries such as Tonga have fewer than 10. Stranger than fiction But it&apos;s not just size that is correlated with extremely low levels of wiki representation. Almost the entire continent of Africa is geographically poorly represented in Wikipedia. Remarkably, there are more Wikipedia articles written about Antarctica than all but one of the 53 countries in Africa (or perhaps more amazingly, there are more Wikipedia articles written about the fictional places of Middle Earth and Discworld than about many countries in Africa, Asia, and the Americas). There are some countries that are crammed with a dense amount of floating virtual information, such as Germany (with an average of one article tagged for every 65 square km), while others remain as virtual deserts, such as Chad (with an average of one tagged article every 17,000 square km). Sharp divides between the Global North and the Global South can likewise be seen when looking at the number of geotagged articles per person. Austria, Iceland and Switzerland all have around one geotagged article for every 1,000 people, while in China or Guinea there is just over one article for every 500,000 people. It needs to be pointed out that only a relatively small number of Wikipedia articles are geotagged. The main reason for this is that a lot of information simply isn&apos;t geotaggable: It wouldn&apos;t make sense to assign co-ordinates to the vast majority of articles on topics such as apples or Teenage Ninja Mutant Turtles. Some explicitly spatial articles do remain untagged. The reason that Burkina Faso has more geotagged articles (1071) than South Africa (945), Kenya (217) and the rest of Africa is probably down to diligent editing rather than more actual content in Burkina Faso. However, in all cases, these numbers pale in comparison to the huge number of articles in places such as the US (89,549) and Germany (54,634). So, I&apos;d argue that: (1) the geographic biases in tagged v untagged articles are relatively small; and (2) because those biases exist we should pay more attention to the general patterns of geographic inequalities in content (ie the fact that there is much more content in the Global North than the Global South) than to the relatively minor differences between places. Every day, countless decisions are made and countless opinions formed based on information available in Wikipedia. If this weren&apos;t the case, the articles on Israel, Kashmir and Taiwan would not host such hotly contested edit wars. Representations within the online encyclopaedia therefore undoubtedly have cultural, economic and political effects. Unexplored territory But what of the places that aren&apos;t even represented? We often hear claims that peer-produced information is broader in scope and more accurate than traditional methods of content creation. This is certainly true, particularly for topics that generate a lot of interest such as &quot;Paris&quot; or &quot;New York&quot;. However, as we increasingly rely on (and trust) web 2.0 sources such as Wikipedia, what will be the effects of this new &quot;terra incognita&quot; in our shared map of knowledge? It may be that when broadband reaches more parts of Africa \u2013 helped by the landfall of superfast cables in August \u2013 that\u00a0more people there will start discovering Wikipedia, and that the site will see a second explosion of new editors and articles about places that have so far been ignored. Or it may be that by then Wikipedia will be passed by in favour of something new. The answers are unclear, but we should nonetheless acknowledge the significant geographic gaps in an encyclopaedia that is described as having reached its limits. It is conceivable that it will only be a matter of time until a new generation of wannabe Wikipedia editors in Zambia, in Indonesia, and in much of the rest of the world begin to fill in the blank spots and construct dense layers of virtual representation. But it is equally conceivable that as peer-produced projects such as Wikipedia become our primary sources of knowledge, we could begin to see permanent information inequalities between different parts of the world. In any case, it is clear that we are far from running out of topics to write about.

While most attention on China&apos;s investment in Africa has focused on its large-scale pursuit of natural resources, experts say a growing number of entrepreneurs are experimenting with production. However, some questioned whether the workshop of the world was ready to outsource much of its industry. &quot;There is not only willingness but strong interest among some in China, and I&apos;ve discussed with the minister of commerce, Chen Deming, that there may be possibilities of moving some of the lower-value manufacturing facilities to sub-Saharan Africa, toys or footwear,&quot; Robert Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, told the Financial Times. He suggested that Chinese knowhow in production and marketing could boost Africa&apos;s declining share of international trade, but admitted infrastructure improvements were needed to attract companies. It is thought the scheme might involve creating industrial parks \u2013 possibly part-funded by the World Bank and China \u2013 so companies could settle in quickly and operate more effectively. The institution sees manufacturing as a missing element in the continent&apos;s development. China is keen that its presence in Africa should be viewed as more than a resources grab. Last month, the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, announced a $10bn (\u00a36bn) low-cost loan initiative, tariff reductions and debt relief-initiatives as the latest steps in its developing partnership. Analysts suggested the measures would help drive demand for Chinese exports as well as aiding African states. Trade between China and Africa reached a record high of $106.84bn in 2008, an increase of 45.1% year-on-year, according to Chinese customs figures. China&apos;s direct investment, excluding the financial sector, rose to \u00a3550m in the first half of this year, up 79%, while the country has built huge amounts of infrastructure in recent years. The relationship has also brought friction, with some African leaders arguing that competition from cheap Chinese imports has undercut an already weak manufacturing base, even if consumers have benefited. Campaigners in Africa as well as the west also complain that China does not press its partners on governance and human rights issues, filling the coffers of leaders whom others believe should not be in power. Dr Jing Gu, of Sussex University&apos;s Institute of Development Studies, said intense domestic competition had already led Chinese companies to look further afield for opportunities. &quot;My own research on Chinese private investment has shown that it is increasingly in manufacturing,&quot; she said. &quot;If you consider Ghana&apos;s 340 Chinese investment projects, more than 100 are in manufacturing. In Ethiopia, about 66% of Chinese companies are. &quot;With China&apos;s push for industrial restructuring at home, Chinese companies have [also] been saying there&apos;s an urgent need to move up the value chain. That might leave a space for Africa. &quot;There are already [government] measures aimed at facilitating access to credit and simplifying procedures for Chinese firms looking to invest overseas, especially in Africa.&quot; Professor Shujie Yao, of the China Policy Institute at Nottingham University, pointed out that many Asian economies had made similar transitions from mass-producing cheap goods to outsourcing manufacturing. &quot;Japan moved its manufacturing to South East Asia ... Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea moved theirs to China,&quot; he said. But he added that any substantial shift of manufacturing could be &quot;painfully slow&quot; given Africa&apos;s infrastructure and said China still had an abundance of cheap labour. Provincial governments might well resist a measure that would be likely to cost jobs. Rhys Jenkins, the professor of development economics at the University of East Anglia, said there were already complaints in Africa that Chinese investors brought in their own labour force to work on projects instead of creating jobs for the local population.

But today the tiny atoll nation of Nauru achieved a rare moment in the international spotlight by saying it will recognise the republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. According to Kommersant newspaper, Russia is preparing to give hard-up Nauru $50m (\u00a330.74m) in humanitarian aid. In return Nauru will establish relations with the two Russian-backed territories. The Kremlin has been frantic to secure international recognition for both regions since its punitive war last year with Georgia. So far only Venezuela and Nicaragua have followed Moscow&apos;s lead, with the rest of the world regarding the rebel provinces as Georgian territory. Even Kremlin allies such as Belarus declined. In mounting desperation, Russia courted Nauru&apos;s foreign minister, Kieren Keke. Over the weekend, Keke dropped in to South Ossetia&apos;s capital, Tskhinvali. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who normally grapples with weightier issues such as Iran&apos;s nuclear programme, also invited Keke for talks. Today Keke was unavailable for comment and the island&apos;s website appeared to have conked out. Observers suggested Russia&apos;s latest diplomatic initiative was worthy of ridicule. &quot;I don&apos;t see the sense in this,&quot; said Alexander Privalov, a columnist and political analyst in Moscow. According to Privalov, Nauru has previously taken money to recognise the independence of Kosovo and Taiwan. In July 2002, Nauru accepted $130m from China to de-recognise Taiwan only to re-recognise it in 2005 after apparently receiving another, better offer. &quot;It seems that political d\u00e9marches are a kind of business in Nauru. It&apos;s a custom there, a bit like wearing a tie,&quot; Privalov said. &quot;I can&apos;t really understand what Russia gets out of this. It may be about making us look more decent.&quot; Germany annexed the island in 1888 and incorporated it into the Marshall Islands Protectorate. Australia occupied it during the first world war, and it subsequently became a mandate country administered by Australia, New Zealand and the UK, with a brief violent incursion by Japan during the second world war. Home to a Pacific people with a unique language, Nauru became independent in 1968. It joined the UN in 1999. The republic, which lies just south of the equator, has been in economic trouble for a decade or so. In 2000 its main resource, fossilised bird droppings mined for their valuable phosphates, began to run out. The island experimented by becoming a tax haven. From 2001 until last year Nauru took in asylum seekers in a money-spinning deal with neighbouring Australia. According to Kommersant, Nauru&apos;s parliament will legislate on South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the current winter session. Nauru officials may also visit Abkhazia \u2013 another somewhat larger micro-territory on the Black Sea. &quot;We will be asking other Oceania countries to help us in the same way,&quot; South Ossetia&apos;s speaker, Stanislav Kochiev, told the paper. Some analysts put a more positive spin on the development, predicting that other tiny island states in Oceania could emulate Nauru. &quot;These small exotic countries make their living from tourism and the issue of collectors&apos; stamps and coins,&quot; said Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the Centre for Political Technologies in Moscow. &quot;These countries need to advertise themselves. Recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia may become their PR act. I don&apos;t rule out recognition statements from several states in the region, in addition to Nauru,&quot;&apos; he told the Interfax news agency . He added: &quot;This is good for the image of Abkhazia and South Ossetia because they can now say they are recognised by four countries.&quot; Russia&apos;s attempt to buy international support on the issue has not always ended happily. In October, Moscow offered Ecuador&apos;s president, Rafael Correa, $200m in loans when he popped into Moscow. Correa subsequently failed to recognise South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and Russia responded by not giving him the money. Last night the Russian foreign ministry spokesman, Igor Liakin-Frolov, said he was too busy to comment."}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/dec/17/plurk-microsoft", "publicationDate": "2009-12-17T20:28:56Z", "tags": ["Microsoft", "Technology startups", "Social networking", "Intellectual property", "Business", "Technology", "Internet"], "sentences": ["It has significant numbers of users across Asia, and claims particularly strong following in countries like Taiwan."], "title": "Startup Plurk 'considering options' against Microsoft", "article": "An internet startup says it is considering legal action against Microsoft, after the world&apos;s biggest software company admitted stealing its code. Earlier this week internet messaging company Plurk accused Microsoft&apos;s MSN China operation of lifting code directly from its own program for use in a rival product. After a brief investigation, Microsoft responded by confirming that it had stolen elements of Plurk&apos;s system and apologising - blaming a Chinese developer hired by MSN China for the transgression. &quot;The vendor has now acknowledged that a portion of the code they provided was indeed copied,&quot; it said. &quot;This was in clear violation of the vendor&apos;s contract with the MSN China joint venture, and equally inconsistent with Microsoft&apos;s policies respecting intellectual property.&quot; An apology may not be enough for the two-year old startup, however, which said that it was looking at &quot;the full extent of our legal options&quot; as a remedy. &quot;We are currently looking at all possibilities on how to move forward in response to Microsoft&apos;s recent apology statement,&quot; said co-founder Alvin Woon in a blog post today.  &quot;We are still thinking of pursuing the full extent of our legal options available due the seriousness of the situation. Basically, Microsoft accepts responsibility, but they do not offer accountability.&quot; The MSN product, Juku, has been suspended pending further investigation, but Woon took particular issue with the extent that it relied on code stolen from his own team.  &quot;This event wasn&apos;t just a simple matter of merely lifting code,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Due to the nature of the uniqueness of our product and user interface, it took a good amount of deliberate studying and digging through our code with the full intention of replicating our product user experience, functionality and end results. This product was later launched and heavily promoted by Microsoft with its big marketing budget.&quot; Plurk, a messaging service along the same lines as Twitter, is registered in Canada but operates a small staff of around seven people worldwide. It has significant numbers of users across Asia, and claims particularly strong following in countries like Taiwan. Faced with a corporate leviathan attempting to muscle in on its territory, Woon said Plurk wanted to stand up for the rights of small companies. &quot;We write our own code and give back to the community when it is appropriate,&quot; he added. &quot;We play the fair game hoping, like many young entrepreneurs out there, to be able to someday help solve other people&apos;s problems and grow our little company.&quot;"}]}
